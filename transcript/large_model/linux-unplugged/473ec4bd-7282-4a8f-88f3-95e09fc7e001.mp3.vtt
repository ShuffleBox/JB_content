WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:03.240
Do you guys remember your 2022 predictions we made?

00:03.400 --> 00:05.980
I try to blank those out just immediately after making them.

00:05.980 --> 00:07.580
That way, I'm surprised next year as well.

00:07.580 --> 00:09.380
Yeah, I feel like that's what I do.

00:09.380 --> 00:11.680
But I don't I don't say I do it on purpose.

00:11.680 --> 00:13.220
It's just what happens.

00:13.220 --> 00:17.620
I'm pretty sure, though, I predicted that Flat Hub would monetize.

00:17.620 --> 00:19.260
Right. Didn't. Oh, yeah.

00:19.260 --> 00:21.020
You sounds vaguely familiar.

00:21.020 --> 00:22.460
Yeah. On that one for a while.

00:22.460 --> 00:25.700
I guess I just wanted to bring that up so that way I could get an attaboy.

00:25.700 --> 00:29.440
But we're getting we're getting a real preview of what that's going to look like.

00:29.440 --> 00:34.000
And we're seeing some code from Purism and others to actually build in

00:34.000 --> 00:36.400
purchasing capabilities in the GNOME software.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.400
And there is a beta version of Flat Hub that you can check out right now

00:40.400 --> 00:41.540
if you want to see what it's like.

00:41.540 --> 00:44.620
It's just a beta flat hub dot org.

00:44.940 --> 00:46.640
And it's a new design.

00:46.640 --> 00:52.120
And it's kind of more GNOME software ish for better or worse.

00:52.860 --> 00:55.920
For example, let's look at the authenticator app, which helps you generate

00:56.360 --> 00:58.100
two factor authentication codes.

00:58.100 --> 01:01.760
When you scroll down, it has a layout and a feature set

01:01.760 --> 01:04.740
and description set very similar to the way GNOME software does.

01:05.760 --> 01:09.600
Not awful, because this aspect of GNOME software, I actually kind of like.

01:09.880 --> 01:11.980
But it's yeah, it's a it's a change for sure.

01:12.380 --> 01:16.740
But they're they're working towards making it possible for transactions.

01:16.740 --> 01:19.840
And it seems like there's going to be a at least a somewhat

01:20.580 --> 01:23.420
of support for pay for what you want model for Flat Hub to.

01:24.620 --> 01:26.420
That's just right around the corner. That's pretty cool.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.420
But do they have a dark mode?

01:28.420 --> 01:31.900
They well, you know, they better.

01:31.900 --> 01:34.960
I want me some dark mode, dark mode purchases.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.540
I could activate my dark reader.

01:36.540 --> 01:38.700
You ready? This will this will make you feel better.

01:38.700 --> 01:41.000
I'll just go over there and I'll activate my own dark mode.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.600
Wow. There you go. Dark reader. Thanks, Chris. Much better.

01:44.600 --> 01:59.880
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

02:00.220 --> 02:03.020
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. And my name is Brent.

02:03.520 --> 02:06.560
Hi, guys. Hello, gentlemen.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.220
Oh, hi. Oh, there. Hello. Oh, that's good.

02:09.220 --> 02:11.800
Oh, I'm glad you're here because we got a big show.

02:11.800 --> 02:16.540
We have really spent the summer looking at these immutable Linux distributions.

02:16.680 --> 02:21.020
Your silver blues, your Nix's after this summer, spending some time with these.

02:21.020 --> 02:25.080
We think there's a good shot that this is the future of mainstream Linux.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.980
I don't know about enthusiast Linux, but I think there's a good chance

02:28.380 --> 02:31.460
this is what your average Linux user will get when they install Linux,

02:31.460 --> 02:33.620
let's say, five, 10 years down the road.

02:34.160 --> 02:36.420
But nothing is so perfect.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.360
It cannot be criticized, a wise man once said.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.420
So today we'll tell you the five problems you can expect

02:42.420 --> 02:47.140
when trying out Nix OS or another immutable Linux type distro like silver blue.

02:47.940 --> 02:50.640
And there's some good. Obviously, we've talked about that.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.780
But after spending some time with it, there's some things

02:52.780 --> 02:54.000
we should probably tell you about, too.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.280
We have to give you the good and the bad.

02:56.280 --> 02:59.580
Plus, after all of that, the breaking change that has Linux developers

02:59.580 --> 03:03.180
so frustrated, one is actually saying the logical solution

03:03.180 --> 03:06.320
is just to target wine when you want to build a Linux app.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.780
Oh, no. We'll talk about that.

03:07.780 --> 03:10.860
Yeah, then we'll round it all out with some boosts and picks and a lot more.

03:10.860 --> 03:13.860
So before we go any further, let's bring in that virtual lug

03:13.860 --> 03:15.800
time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.100
Hello, hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.300
Hi, Chris. Hi, Bryson. Hi, Brent.

03:20.300 --> 03:23.360
Hello. If you'd like to join our mumble room, it's Linux unplugged.com

03:23.360 --> 03:24.900
slash mumble for the info.

03:24.900 --> 03:28.140
And then we're live Sundays, noon Pacific, 3 p.m.

03:28.140 --> 03:31.540
Eastern. You can pop in there and get your thoughts on the show.

03:31.540 --> 03:33.180
You just take me to the chat room.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.540
Also, I'd love to say good morning to tail scale.

03:35.540 --> 03:36.920
Have you tried out tail scale yet?

03:36.920 --> 03:40.380
It's the best mesh VPN out there protected by WireGuard.

03:40.860 --> 03:43.560
Oh, man, I have I have I have tail scale on everything.

03:43.560 --> 03:46.400
I have tail scale on absolutely everything.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.760
And I have turned off all inbound ports on my firewalls completely.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.300
No more inbound ports. I love it.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.500
It's going to change your networking game.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.600
Go try it out for free on 20 devices.

03:55.600 --> 03:59.380
Tail scale dot com and tell them some plugs that you go say good morning.

04:00.380 --> 04:03.640
OK, so we talked about this a little bit on Linux action news,

04:03.980 --> 04:05.840
but I wanted to expand the discussion here.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.920
This is a tricky situation.

04:07.920 --> 04:11.760
It involves G lib C and a new version was released.

04:12.180 --> 04:15.060
And of course, the rolling distros get it first, like your arches.

04:15.060 --> 04:18.220
Mm hmm. And it wasn't long after a new version of G lib

04:18.220 --> 04:20.960
C, which just about all software on Linux depends on.

04:21.520 --> 04:25.260
It wasn't long after that new release came out that ARCH users were discovering

04:25.260 --> 04:30.080
that their video games with anti cheat were no longer working.

04:30.800 --> 04:34.840
And Weston involves changes in this hash section of G lib C.

04:34.840 --> 04:38.220
Right. Yeah, as as part of once you've got like got things linked up,

04:38.220 --> 04:40.220
you've got your L file written on disk.

04:40.220 --> 04:43.720
Well, you want to be able to quickly find the symbols contained there.

04:44.060 --> 04:48.560
And so there's a nice little hash table, an ability to go quickly, look those things up.

04:49.360 --> 04:54.660
There's an older style DT underscore hash, and then there's a new version DT underscore

04:54.660 --> 04:57.460
Gnu underscore hash that's been around for a long time.

04:57.460 --> 05:01.200
And at this point is sort of the de facto standard for most things compiled with

05:01.200 --> 05:06.080
G lib C and the way most things have been shipping. But up until recently,

05:06.540 --> 05:11.880
the way configuration was run at various build times and library distros and upstream,

05:11.880 --> 05:17.080
it meant you would get both versions of that hash table by default in a recent version.

05:17.080 --> 05:20.160
They were dropping the old style one. It was like, hey, look, it seems like

05:20.820 --> 05:24.200
everyone's been adding our new version for ages now.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.200
It's been over a decade. We don't really let you know, saves a little bit of disk space.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.000
We can just drop it. We're not interested in maintaining this here.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.500
Any longer, at least not have it as a default option.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.900
And then we find out that, yeah, it turns out some things were still using it.

05:36.900 --> 05:39.900
Yeah, specifically vidya games, probably other ones, too, though.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.920
We know about a library that was broken that also involves graphics.

05:42.920 --> 05:47.220
But the reality is, is that when it does ship to all the other distributions out there,

05:47.620 --> 05:49.620
we'll discover more things that break. Right.

05:49.620 --> 05:52.920
The guess what? A lot of a lot of gamers like Arch these days.

05:52.920 --> 05:57.120
So the rolling distros got it first. But no doubt other software will break as well.

05:57.120 --> 06:01.120
Well, and you know, Arch also is usually it doesn't they're not carrying a lot of changes and things.

06:01.120 --> 06:05.420
So when an upstream default does change, they don't often have like a ton of patch sets against that.

06:05.420 --> 06:07.620
Right. So it's whatever whatever happens upstream.

06:07.620 --> 06:11.420
Yeah, although that'll be changing. They will be carrying their own patch set for this.

06:11.420 --> 06:16.120
Other distributions will have to as well. It's part of a bigger discussion.

06:16.920 --> 06:21.920
Valve even offered to help with some of this because obviously they're concerned it breaks a lot of their stuff.

06:21.920 --> 06:29.220
And it actually touches on what makes Linux good and bad as a platform to ship applications on.

06:29.220 --> 06:32.620
And we often talk about breaking changes from the kernel's perspective.

06:32.620 --> 06:37.020
And we talk about Linus's strong stance on never breaking user space.

06:37.020 --> 06:44.120
That matters. But if some of the other fundamental things like G Lib C don't follow that same philosophy,

06:44.120 --> 06:50.620
you can't really tell application developers it's a great stable platform with non-breaking changes.

06:50.620 --> 06:56.620
And so you'll see this is where distributions play a role in the Linux ecosystem.

06:56.620 --> 07:02.620
Distributions are going to have to step up and start patching G Lib C to support both the original version

07:02.620 --> 07:05.620
and the GNU version of this hash section.

07:05.620 --> 07:11.120
And that'll just be one more thing they have to maintain now because upstream isn't really interested in maintaining the old thing.

07:11.120 --> 07:15.620
And these anti-cheat software makers who are mostly Windows developers,

07:15.620 --> 07:20.620
they're not interested in making a change for the way G Lib C now does things.

07:20.620 --> 07:22.620
Like it's just a total non-starter for them.

07:22.620 --> 07:28.620
And so this has led one of the Proton developers who's well respected to just come out and say,

07:28.620 --> 07:32.620
the only logical thing to target Linux when you're an application developer,

07:32.620 --> 07:41.620
if you want to guarantee years of compatibility, is target the Win32 API on Linux and use one.

07:41.620 --> 07:46.620
They say, these problems just happen all the time on Linux.

07:46.620 --> 07:48.620
Different parts of the Linux stack will break.

07:48.620 --> 07:51.620
This is most likely never going to change.

07:51.620 --> 07:59.620
And so therefore, Win32, aka Wine, is the only stable ABI on Linux.

07:59.620 --> 08:02.620
And they kind of wrap it all up with some final thoughts.

08:02.620 --> 08:08.620
They say, I think this whole situation shows why creating native games for Linux is challenging.

08:08.620 --> 08:13.620
It's hard to blame developers for targeting Windows and then relying on Wine and Friends.

08:13.620 --> 08:18.620
It's just more stable and much less likely to break and stay broken.

08:18.620 --> 08:20.620
That's pretty damning.

08:20.620 --> 08:25.620
And it's hard not to say they're wrong when this whole breakage situation is going down right now.

08:25.620 --> 08:27.620
I mean, who knows how it'll end up.

08:27.620 --> 08:31.620
Yeah, although I mean, I think maybe we should be careful about what kind of applications we're talking about.

08:31.620 --> 08:34.620
It's not like this broke a whole bunch of these common Linux apps.

08:34.620 --> 08:36.620
There are some.

08:36.620 --> 08:38.620
In one sense, it's almost not surprising, right?

08:38.620 --> 08:42.620
Like a lot of this, we're not used to shipping this kind of application on Linux distribution.

08:42.620 --> 08:44.620
I mean, we're getting there and it's getting better.

08:44.620 --> 08:46.620
And this definitely is causing problems.

08:46.620 --> 08:52.620
But we're used to just having software come from distros where things get built consistently, right?

08:52.620 --> 08:54.620
That they all get integrated together.

08:54.620 --> 09:02.620
And so having compatibility for random binary applications across time has not always been the same kind of focus

09:02.620 --> 09:06.620
that admittedly and we should give credit to Microsoft has had in the Windows world.

09:06.620 --> 09:11.620
Again, not as a judgment, just like in this sense, to me, it's not really that surprising because it's kind of a, you know,

09:11.620 --> 09:14.620
it's just not what people have really thought about.

09:14.620 --> 09:22.620
You could understand how Windows developers specifically in the gaming area might be a little unfamiliar with this type of approach

09:22.620 --> 09:27.620
where they are a little bit more familiar with Microsoft's type of approach, which has been maybe more accommodating.

09:27.620 --> 09:29.620
And I think you could argue both.

09:29.620 --> 09:39.620
This is a decade old hash function that has been replaced and literally just about everything else in the world is not using this.

09:39.620 --> 09:43.620
But Brent, don't you think this is sort of like a clear indicator?

09:43.620 --> 09:47.620
When we've had all of these discussions about is the distro still necessary?

09:47.620 --> 09:49.620
Can people just build it from scratch if there's an enthusiast?

09:49.620 --> 09:52.620
What's the role of the Linux distribution with containers and all of that?

09:52.620 --> 09:54.620
To me, this seems like pretty clear.

09:54.620 --> 09:57.620
There's still a role for distribution maintainers to play here.

09:57.620 --> 10:04.620
Well, and I wonder if that role, you know, has it seen a bit less attention these days?

10:04.620 --> 10:09.620
Like I know flat packs and stuff solve similar ish problems by bundling libraries and stuff.

10:09.620 --> 10:13.620
So I wonder, do we have less maintainers kind of looking at stuff?

10:13.620 --> 10:21.620
Or is this a problem of like using some kind of deprecated software for something that maybe you should have targeted differently?

10:21.620 --> 10:23.620
I wonder if that's the case, too.

10:23.620 --> 10:30.620
I mean, it seems like there's a lot of those aspects, it seems also that, you know, we're used to working within a sort of larger free software community.

10:30.620 --> 10:37.620
So it might be clear for distro maintainers or people who work with like the GNU folks or things that like, oh, yeah, of course, this is the standard that is now being used.

10:37.620 --> 10:46.620
But if you're some third party who just went and found some like, you know, sysv, compact, you know, general guide to working with this libc, oh, I need to go look up some symbols.

10:46.620 --> 10:48.620
Oh, yeah, GT hash, that seems like the thing that's been here forever.

10:48.620 --> 10:49.620
I'm going to use that.

10:49.620 --> 10:56.620
You're not really plugged in on the same level. And so our normal methods of sort of like, look, we we added this, we gave you all a decade.

10:56.620 --> 10:59.620
It seemed like we were cool. We'd given you a time for backwards compatibility.

10:59.620 --> 11:06.620
And then also with some things, this is not maybe for anti cheap, but just in games in general, sort of class of application that just gets made.

11:06.620 --> 11:09.620
And then there's not once the update stop, that game is just done.

11:09.620 --> 11:12.620
And that's another thing that you don't just don't run that many things like that.

11:12.620 --> 11:20.620
Well, and developers have, you know, such a reputation for just voluntarily adopting new technologies and new functions without being forced to do it like that's the thing.

11:20.620 --> 11:24.620
Of course, if they didn't have to, they didn't stop using it. Why would they make that change?

11:24.620 --> 11:29.620
It's just that's the sort of thing that is just foregone conclusion in the world of development.

11:29.620 --> 11:37.620
I actually think there is something to this win 32 is the only stable ABI, but I think it's actually less and less of a problem than ever.

11:37.620 --> 11:42.620
And I think, Brent, you just touched on it there with Flatpak, and I will admit to an ignorance here.

11:42.620 --> 11:46.620
And so if someone knows that's listening, maybe they're in the live chat or boosted in.

11:46.620 --> 11:51.620
If I'm using the Flatpak version of Steam and Proton.

11:51.620 --> 12:03.620
Are they or could they just ship their own version of Gillib C or is Gillib C such a fundamental library to the way everything works that that's outside the scope of Flatpak?

12:03.620 --> 12:11.620
I think I saw that they had an older one still, so I hadn't gotten to this version yet, at least in the race of this time of this most recent discussion.

12:11.620 --> 12:17.620
The runtime ship is on Gillib C as well as Mesa and generally everything else.

12:17.620 --> 12:23.620
Everything from Gillib C, everything apart of the kernel is been from scratch on the ground up.

12:23.620 --> 12:26.620
So this thing wouldn't happen.

12:26.620 --> 12:35.620
You wouldn't have an issue running against a new Gillib C on the host as long that you could like start namespace and stuff.

12:35.620 --> 12:39.620
So I could be OK since I'm using a Flatpak version of Steam.

12:39.620 --> 12:52.620
Yes, totally. It's still I think in the 22 of 08 release that's about to be released like in a couple of days when we will update also the Steam Flatpak.

12:52.620 --> 12:58.620
Because it's one of the main things we test when we release new runtimes.

12:58.620 --> 13:04.620
We are sticking to Gillib C 2.35 and that was like way before any of this broke up.

13:04.620 --> 13:07.620
Just like didn't manage to update on time.

13:07.620 --> 13:13.620
You know, I have to say and this isn't like a fanboy based decision and this is totally just made out of practicality.

13:13.620 --> 13:21.620
But my mentality now, especially when I'm building the next OS based desktop is there has to be a justification why I wouldn't use a Flatpak.

13:21.620 --> 13:26.620
Because they've worked so well for me and they're so easy to update and maintain.

13:26.620 --> 13:30.620
And Flat Hub is such a quick resource to go collect everything really quick and install it all.

13:30.620 --> 13:33.620
And especially once you've hit a critical mass of like I'm using enough Flatpak.

13:33.620 --> 13:36.620
It's like, well, I'm always installing Flatpaks now. So, of course, I've got Flathub configured.

13:36.620 --> 13:38.620
It's all just ready to go. Click, click, click, click.

13:38.620 --> 13:40.620
And so I mean, I guess I'm shocked how well Steam has worked.

13:40.620 --> 13:46.620
But I have run into problems and we will get to that when we get to our five issues with Nix.

13:46.620 --> 13:54.620
Now, Chris, did this affect the Steam Deck at all? Because you mentioned it showed up on Archverse and I wondered, was that a thing on the Deck?

13:54.620 --> 13:59.620
No. And doesn't this kind of even underscore why Valve chose to just make their own distribution?

13:59.620 --> 14:01.620
Is to avoid just these kinds of problems.

14:01.620 --> 14:06.620
They'll never ship this issue in Steam OS. So the Deck will never have this problem.

14:06.620 --> 14:15.620
It's incredible what Proton and Wine have done so that we can, you know, we can just steal the stability of another platform's implementation stuff to run on our own.

14:15.620 --> 14:18.620
And have it work and paper over some of our own native issues.

14:18.620 --> 14:26.620
But we've also got kind of the confluence of other technologies like, you know, various containerizations and namespacing that makes it somewhat easier to have these things.

14:26.620 --> 14:29.620
You know, you can have the whole Steam environment. You can have Flatpaks containing this stuff.

14:29.620 --> 14:31.620
Like, we just have a lot of options now.

14:31.620 --> 14:36.620
Yeah. Minimac, you think that Windows isn't necessarily immune from this type of problem?

14:36.620 --> 14:38.620
Yeah, that was a question I had.

14:38.620 --> 14:47.620
Couldn't that happen in the Windows environment too? But the big difference is that every company is publishing their software in Windows.

14:47.620 --> 14:51.620
They just get a notice before and they can adapt before that change happens.

14:51.620 --> 14:57.620
Yeah, I suppose there probably is a more formalized developer notification and outreach.

14:57.620 --> 15:02.620
That's just not really a scalable solution in free software, right?

15:02.620 --> 15:08.620
Because the GLibc maintainers are probably not even thinking about anti-cheat when they're making this change.

15:08.620 --> 15:19.620
And they're not really at a nine-to-five job where they're going to reach out to the stakeholders and hold a meeting where they can all jump on Zoom and discuss each one of their key points.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.620
That's just not going to happen in this environment.

15:21.620 --> 15:29.620
Well, and there's some nuance there too, you know, that some of them on the mailing list point do try to point out that like, look, we do generally take ABI breaks seriously.

15:29.620 --> 15:33.620
It's not that we're against, you know, we just hadn't really thought of this in that way before.

15:33.620 --> 15:39.620
You know, like the way that the ELF ends up on the disk was not really part of what we thought of as the GLibc ABI in the past.

15:39.620 --> 15:44.620
And then there's some questions about like, OK, well, does that prevent us to add another possible hash scheme in the future?

15:44.620 --> 15:55.620
If EAC were to update to DT GNU underscore hash, and then how would you handle a similar, like, can we give it another 15 years and then switch that out to an even better implementation or are we stuck like totally frozen forever?

15:55.620 --> 16:03.620
I mean, OK, so to their credit, they do seem to be listening. But to Minimac's point, I do think a company would probably have communicated this better.

16:03.620 --> 16:06.620
So that's probably a good way to frame it. It's not that this thing would never happen on Windows.

16:06.620 --> 16:10.620
We see these kinds of changes. It's just there's maybe Mac OS as a good example, right?

16:10.620 --> 16:13.620
They drop things, make you shift to new APIs all the time.

16:13.620 --> 16:17.620
Yeah, but I think they'd probably announce that at WWDC, right?

16:17.620 --> 16:22.620
So you'd have the summer to update your app. And for a lot of developers, that's not enough time.

16:22.620 --> 16:30.620
But there is that window there. And I think everyone has has plainly said that clearly there's like not some not great docs on this.

16:30.620 --> 16:39.620
And like clarity around what the upstream considers as like the standards, even if it's implicitly known in the community, probably should do a better job there, too.

16:39.620 --> 16:44.620
Yeah. So if you're on a distribution that updates frequently and you like your steam games, just keep your eyes out for this.

16:44.620 --> 16:48.620
Distribution maintainers are already kind of adapting, but it's just something you need to be aware of.

16:48.620 --> 16:53.620
And if you're on an LTS or something like that, then you get to sit back and laugh at the rollers for a little bit.

16:53.620 --> 16:55.620
Enjoy this for a moment.

16:59.620 --> 17:04.620
Linode.com slash unplugged. Go there to get a hundred dollars and support the show.

17:04.620 --> 17:08.620
It's a great way to really get started and deploy something you've been meaning to try for a long time.

17:08.620 --> 17:12.620
No judgment there. We've all got projects we've been meaning to get to.

17:12.620 --> 17:16.620
And Linode's probably one of the best places you could consider to deploy.

17:16.620 --> 17:25.620
So they started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing back before you called it cloud computing kids.

17:25.620 --> 17:29.620
And now nearly 19 years later, they're rocking harder than ever.

17:29.620 --> 17:33.620
They've got 11 global data centers. They've got the fastest machines in the biz.

17:33.620 --> 17:36.620
In fact, they recently did MVME upgrades.

17:36.620 --> 17:41.620
And I still am getting emails from listeners out there that are just completely blown away.

17:41.620 --> 17:47.620
I think the email usually starts with, holy crap, I had no idea how much better things would be with an MVME drive.

17:47.620 --> 17:51.620
You know, I get it because you think it's a web server. I'm connecting over, you know, a slow Internet connection.

17:51.620 --> 17:57.620
How how much better could it be? Oh, no, no. Oh, no. More IOPS is always better.

17:57.620 --> 18:02.620
That's where they get the AMD epic processors, too. They are their own ISP.

18:02.620 --> 18:05.620
The list really goes on when it comes to Linode.

18:05.620 --> 18:13.620
I think I could sit here and I could just say I could sum up like the key thing that Linode does is they run Linux really well in the cloud.

18:13.620 --> 18:17.620
That's like the key thing. And then they build a bunch of stuff around that that makes it even better.

18:17.620 --> 18:19.620
I absolutely love their cloud dashboard.

18:19.620 --> 18:25.620
I think it's the best in the business combined with the best API in the business with a command line client with a ton of libraries.

18:25.620 --> 18:29.620
So you could just use Python or I don't know, maybe you're a Rust person.

18:29.620 --> 18:33.620
Yeah, they got a gorgeous API with lots of libraries ready to go.

18:33.620 --> 18:35.620
But you guys, if you listen to the show, you know what's up.

18:35.620 --> 18:38.620
You know how much I love the S3 compatible object storage.

18:38.620 --> 18:43.620
We use it as the back end for next cloud. We use it as the back end for our Jupiter tube.

18:43.620 --> 18:46.620
We just use it as the back end for all kinds of stuff, just even moving files around.

18:46.620 --> 18:52.620
Like when we go to an event and we record a bunch of audio or video, we sort that all out and put it up on the object storage.

18:52.620 --> 19:00.620
They got cloud firewalls, DDoS protection, VLAN support, a powerful DNS manager, Kubernetes support, Ansible support, Terraform support.

19:00.620 --> 19:04.620
I mean, it's just on and on. And it starts at like one click deployment type stuff.

19:04.620 --> 19:09.620
If that's what you're comfortable with all the way down to Nuke and Pave and build it up from the ground yourself.

19:09.620 --> 19:16.620
They've even got physical boxes and they have pricing 30 to 50 percent cheaper than the other major cloud providers out there.

19:16.620 --> 19:24.620
And if you ever run into any trouble, they've got the best support in the business by phone or by ticket 24 seven three sixty five.

19:24.620 --> 19:27.620
No other cloud providers architected in a way to make that sustainable.

19:27.620 --> 19:33.620
But Linode is. Go try it for yourself. See why we've been raving about it. Get 100 bucks and support the show.

19:33.620 --> 19:36.620
You do that by going to Linode dot com slash unplugged.

19:36.620 --> 19:40.620
Get 100 dollars for 60 days to try it out to see what we've been talking about.

19:40.620 --> 19:47.620
One more time, support the show by going to Linode dot com slash unplugged.

19:47.620 --> 19:51.620
It's been a minute since we've cleaned up around here, so we have a few things to tend to.

19:51.620 --> 19:53.620
Why is there so much straw on the floor?

19:53.620 --> 20:03.620
The last few days to get your name in the hat for the JPL tour, like literally, if you're listening to this as we publish only a few days left,

20:03.620 --> 20:12.620
we're going to be rolling the dice and picking 15 names to join us at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory September 29th as the finale.

20:12.620 --> 20:16.620
Actually, not quite the finale because we have we have two meetups after that.

20:16.620 --> 20:20.620
But a key moment in our road trip. Nice save. Nice save, Chris.

20:20.620 --> 20:24.620
I imagine we probably have more than 15 people who have submitted, but not more.

20:24.620 --> 20:28.620
I wouldn't expect a ton more because you have to be in the area. So how many responses have we gotten so far?

20:28.620 --> 20:32.620
Forty nine as of whatever, five minutes before we started the show today.

20:32.620 --> 20:34.620
Those are pretty good odds. That is pretty good.

20:34.620 --> 20:38.620
Those are. So you still got to eat like if you're listening when we're live, you got a couple more days.

20:38.620 --> 20:40.620
What do you pick a day?

20:40.620 --> 20:47.620
I feel like Wednesday when you and I are recording land, we'll we'll we'll run the bot to do the pick.

20:47.620 --> 20:51.620
Well, all right. We'll do the computations. So you have till Wednesday the week.

20:51.620 --> 20:56.620
This is publishing Wednesday, the 24th. Yes. Linux unplugged dot com slash JPL for that.

20:56.620 --> 21:02.620
But we have a bunch of other meetups. Portland area, Southern Oregon area, Northern California area.

21:02.620 --> 21:07.620
We'll have another meetup in Southern California. So we'll also have micro meetups if you're in the area when we're driving around.

21:07.620 --> 21:10.620
So meetup dot com slash Jupiter broadcasting for all that.

21:10.620 --> 21:14.620
And then if you're a local and you want to chat about details or you have suggestions

21:14.620 --> 21:19.620
or you want to get the four one one on what's really going on, some Brent gossip.

21:19.620 --> 21:26.620
Go to bit dot l y slash West Coast crew. That's our matrix room dedicated to the West Coast.

21:26.620 --> 21:28.620
Then also just a little production note for next week.

21:28.620 --> 21:34.620
We're wrapping up our tour of Immutable Linux distros with a look at endless OS and a special guest.

21:34.620 --> 21:39.620
So if you'd like to chat endless OS, maybe join the Mumble Room and come in here and toss your thoughts.

21:39.620 --> 21:48.620
Yeah. Yeah. Go grab it. We'll be chatting about it next week. Little heads up on the program and notes right there.

21:48.620 --> 21:51.620
And with that, we have something new. We're going to do our baller boosts right here.

21:51.620 --> 21:54.620
We're changing up the way we do boosts on the show in a big way.

21:54.620 --> 21:56.620
I will tell you more about that in a little bit.

21:56.620 --> 22:01.620
But I wanted to start with a couple of baller boosts that came into the show this week.

22:01.620 --> 22:05.620
And our first one is the largest boost I think the show's ever received.

22:05.620 --> 22:11.620
It was actually spread across five amazing boosts. But one of the things we're trying to do is make this a little tighter, a little more condensed.

22:11.620 --> 22:17.620
So I added it all up. Lo Palm boosted in with two hundred and fifty thousand sacks.

22:17.620 --> 22:22.620
Because I'm a back home baller in pajamas that cost ten dollars.

22:22.620 --> 22:26.620
Tell my mother that I love her more than any freaking other. That's the life of a back home baller.

22:26.620 --> 22:30.620
All right. Officially a back home baller in our report. That is impressive.

22:30.620 --> 22:37.620
Lo Palm also signs all of his boosts with a lull face and a palm tree, which I like a lot.

22:37.620 --> 22:42.620
I didn't put them all in here, but there was a lot of palm trees in our boost feed this week.

22:42.620 --> 22:47.620
Lo Palm writes, Thanks for covering Nick's. It made me really check it out this time and I love it.

22:47.620 --> 22:50.620
I also wanted to chip in some gas money for Brent.

22:50.620 --> 22:51.620
Oh, thanks.

22:51.620 --> 22:55.620
He notes that he normally uses Pocket Cast. That's a really popular one.

22:55.620 --> 22:57.620
But I'm trying out Breeze for the boosts.

22:57.620 --> 23:02.620
And now I've even figured out how to set my username. I hope it shows up in the boosts.

23:02.620 --> 23:05.620
It does, Lo Palm. Thank you very much.

23:05.620 --> 23:10.620
I like I think he added the emojis because earlier he hadn't figured out how to change his username.

23:10.620 --> 23:15.620
So I'll just sign. Yeah, it's my signature move. I like it.

23:15.620 --> 23:18.620
I'm also glad that putting emojis in there doesn't break the system.

23:18.620 --> 23:22.620
You know, I think that's also it's nice to know. I wasn't sure.

23:22.620 --> 23:28.620
So now we do know. And then we got one other baller boost this week from TomatoDeer, 46,000 sats.

23:28.620 --> 23:33.620
Because I'm a back home baller. If I want something, I just holler.

23:33.620 --> 23:38.620
He wanted to boost in and support the show and also pass along his perfect Linux setup.

23:38.620 --> 23:41.620
So you ready for this, gentlemen? I think I'm ready.

23:41.620 --> 23:42.620
Yeah, lay it on us.

23:42.620 --> 23:45.620
Starts with a GNU slash Linux base. Oh, great. Of course.

23:45.620 --> 23:48.620
Add a little wire guard. Oh, OK.

23:48.620 --> 23:54.620
Put a little jellyfin on there. Bitwarden. Oh, plasma desktop. MPV for your media.

23:54.620 --> 23:57.620
Definitely. Emacs and Vim. Why not both? Sure.

23:57.620 --> 24:03.620
Yeah, I guess. Right. Oh, throw a nano in the mix, too. Oh, Galatarian.

24:03.620 --> 24:08.620
OK, OK. One Chris over right there. You know what? Let's be honest.

24:08.620 --> 24:10.620
That's how it should be. Why not all three? Right.

24:10.620 --> 24:13.620
I don't have to be text editor monogamous, but a little VSCode on there, too.

24:13.620 --> 24:16.620
Now I just want to know how much disk space nano is taking up on my box all the time.

24:16.620 --> 24:19.620
And then, yeah, you know it, of course. He's also got SSH on there.

24:19.620 --> 24:22.620
That, he says, is the perfect Linux stack.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.620
Lean and mean. I like it.

24:26.620 --> 24:27.620
Thank you, Ballers.

24:27.620 --> 24:32.620
All right, so let's talk about five problems that we've come across while using Nix OS.

24:32.620 --> 24:36.620
And I think these are probably almost universally true for all immutable Linux's.

24:36.620 --> 24:38.620
And it's something you should be aware of.

24:38.620 --> 24:43.620
A couple of these might be Nix specific, but, you know, like we've talked a lot about the positives.

24:43.620 --> 24:45.620
And on the whole, we are very happy.

24:45.620 --> 24:47.620
You know, been gushing a bit, you might say.

24:47.620 --> 24:52.620
But I feel like we also should be honest and talk about where things can be a little different.

24:52.620 --> 24:56.620
I think this is the most obvious one, but it's the one we should start with.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.620
You got to configure, like, everything.

24:58.620 --> 25:01.620
Isn't that the feature as well?

25:01.620 --> 25:04.620
They do have a graphical installer, which will set up some of the basics.

25:04.620 --> 25:05.620
But, like, every application.

25:05.620 --> 25:07.620
I'm still impressed that's possible, even.

25:07.620 --> 25:12.620
Yeah, every service, everything you install will just be defaults in each setup.

25:12.620 --> 25:16.620
And sometimes this bites you, like I installed Plasma.

25:16.620 --> 25:19.620
And, you know, I was a little underwhelmed with the look.

25:19.620 --> 25:20.620
The fonts didn't look quite right.

25:20.620 --> 25:25.620
It just didn't seem like any, well, nobody really touched it, for better or for worse.

25:25.620 --> 25:32.620
I was surprised, especially in Nix OS itself, how some things were kind of left like that.

25:32.620 --> 25:35.620
And then a few others were very thoughtfully integrated.

25:35.620 --> 25:40.620
You know, like some of the system level plumbing, I guess, gets the, is often like, you know,

25:40.620 --> 25:43.620
you don't have to worry about, it's not archery.

25:43.620 --> 25:45.620
You've installed something and you're manually enabling stuff, right?

25:45.620 --> 25:49.620
You just sort of tell Nix OS, like, hey, I want this thing both installed and to be operating.

25:49.620 --> 25:50.620
Yeah, right.

25:50.620 --> 25:56.620
But then, as you say, there's a lot of, like, the user level stuff that just is not, hasn't been pre-configured for you

25:56.620 --> 26:00.620
in the way that, like, a desktop focused distribution often does, I guess.

26:00.620 --> 26:01.620
Yeah.

26:01.620 --> 26:07.620
So there's that element, although there's generally guides for most of this stuff, for better or for worse.

26:07.620 --> 26:11.620
I don't know if the documentation I'd say is great.

26:11.620 --> 26:16.620
I think the ArchWiki is actually much more effective as a tool for getting the system configured.

26:16.620 --> 26:21.620
There's extensive documentation for Nix, but in my opinion, it kind of lives in that uncanny valley

26:21.620 --> 26:28.620
where it gets a lot, but then it just says things and has terms where if you're not familiar with Nix,

26:28.620 --> 26:30.620
you're like, I don't know what that means.

26:30.620 --> 26:32.620
I don't know what to do next.

26:32.620 --> 26:37.620
I literally have, I feel like there's almost always some assumed knowledge in every single one of the guides

26:37.620 --> 26:41.620
where I get to it, I'm like, OK, so now I've got to go figure out what they're talking about here

26:41.620 --> 26:45.620
by reading, like, three other forum posts, that way I get an average of what everybody's saying

26:45.620 --> 26:48.620
so I can kind of try to get the right thing and then come back and continue.

26:48.620 --> 26:50.620
And I find that really frustrating.

26:50.620 --> 26:55.620
Also, like, there'll often be examples and it's just an example in a vacuum and doesn't consider, like,

26:55.620 --> 26:59.620
what else you might have set up and configured and doesn't work in, like, most production scenarios.

26:59.620 --> 27:01.620
And then so the example isn't really any good.

27:01.620 --> 27:05.620
So those two things combined that you have to configure everything and the documentation is good,

27:05.620 --> 27:08.620
but, like, that final 10% is really missing.

27:08.620 --> 27:13.620
I think there's, like, a certain spikiness sometimes to the difficulty where, like, most of the time,

27:13.620 --> 27:17.620
and it seems to be just getting a lot better, especially recently, you know, it's like, oh, this is real easy,

27:17.620 --> 27:23.620
I'm on the happy path, I just, you know, I just type that I wanted this in and it's working and it's all set up

27:23.620 --> 27:27.620
and robust and great, and then occasionally you just hit a pothole and then you're, like,

27:27.620 --> 27:32.620
falling six layers down the abstraction stack and you're learning about this functional language

27:32.620 --> 27:36.620
to define your builds and then sometimes if you're doing something weird or cross-compiling,

27:36.620 --> 27:42.620
like, you have to remember that compilers are involved and build tool chains and that's just another,

27:42.620 --> 27:46.620
it's all great and very powerful and it enables clearly a lot of, like, the magic of Nix,

27:46.620 --> 27:49.620
but sometimes that's not really what you want.

27:49.620 --> 27:55.620
Yeah. The Nix Nerds Matrix chat room has saved me in those situations several times.

27:55.620 --> 27:58.620
We are very lucky to have that, that's for sure.

27:58.620 --> 28:04.620
All right, this next one. This is going to sound weird, but if you've never used Nix, you might not expect this.

28:04.620 --> 28:08.620
You can't just download a binary file and run it. Like, you don't just download something,

28:08.620 --> 28:11.620
make it executable, and then run it.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.620
You mean my curl pipe bash is broken?

28:13.620 --> 28:18.620
That ain't going to work because, like, this thing is living in basically a blank environment.

28:18.620 --> 28:21.620
It doesn't even know what loader to use to launch the binary.

28:21.620 --> 28:26.620
It is, because it hasn't been defined by the overall Nix system, it exists basically in a vacuum.

28:26.620 --> 28:33.620
And there are a lot of ways to solve this problem, including ways to spin up environments on the fly,

28:33.620 --> 28:35.620
on demand, that do have everything you need.

28:35.620 --> 28:41.620
But it seems that the, like, just sort of lazy practical way that a lot of Nix users have solved this,

28:41.620 --> 28:48.620
which isn't ideal, but oddly works well, is they've just installed the Steam Dash run package.

28:48.620 --> 28:53.620
Steam Dash run, as you would expect, is basically a little mini environment

28:53.620 --> 28:57.620
that has all the essentials you need to run a binary on Linux.

28:57.620 --> 29:01.620
And so you Steam run binaries that you download, doesn't have to be games,

29:01.620 --> 29:05.620
doesn't have to do anything with Steam, you don't even have to have Steam installed.

29:05.620 --> 29:07.620
You just need Steam run.

29:07.620 --> 29:10.620
And then you can run any binary you want, but it's not really the blessed way.

29:10.620 --> 29:14.620
You're not really supposed to be doing it that way, and the documentation covers this.

29:14.620 --> 29:15.620
You don't say.

29:15.620 --> 29:19.620
But I have to tell you, I understand why.

29:19.620 --> 29:23.620
But boy, was I a little dumbfounded the first time I downloaded a binary.

29:23.620 --> 29:28.620
I think it was something for production that we use that isn't packaged.

29:28.620 --> 29:31.620
And I can't remember, because Reaper is packaged, so I can't remember what it is.

29:31.620 --> 29:33.620
And I downloaded it, and it just doesn't work.

29:33.620 --> 29:35.620
You try to run it, you're like, what?

29:35.620 --> 29:37.620
And, you know, of course, the first thing I do is check the permission.

29:37.620 --> 29:39.620
Does it have the executable bit?

29:39.620 --> 29:40.620
Yes, it does.

29:40.620 --> 29:41.620
All right.

29:41.620 --> 29:42.620
Okay.

29:42.620 --> 29:43.620
All right.

29:43.620 --> 29:45.620
So I start going over to Google.

29:45.620 --> 29:49.620
You know, can't run binary, and then it auto completes in Nix OS.

29:49.620 --> 29:52.620
And I'm like, uh.

29:52.620 --> 29:53.620
Yeah.

29:53.620 --> 29:54.620
This is a thing.

29:54.620 --> 29:55.620
So that's a problem.

29:55.620 --> 29:56.620
It's totally solvable.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.620
You'll understand why once you get into Nix.

29:58.620 --> 30:02.620
It is a thing, but it'll throw a curveball at you.

30:02.620 --> 30:03.620
Right.

30:03.620 --> 30:06.620
And if you don't need it, you know, there's also containers that are easily supported

30:06.620 --> 30:08.620
if you're doing something on the server side.

30:08.620 --> 30:09.620
Yeah.

30:09.620 --> 30:15.620
And honestly, 90% ish of everything I'm using is flat packs these days.

30:15.620 --> 30:16.620
And those are fine.

30:16.620 --> 30:17.620
Just zero problem there.

30:17.620 --> 30:21.620
So instead of learning how to use Nix and write Nix expressions, you've just learned

30:21.620 --> 30:22.620
how to make flat packs.

30:22.620 --> 30:27.620
Well, I had to learn for VS Code because VS Code I tried as a flat pack, and I had to

30:27.620 --> 30:29.620
give it the old thumbs down.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.620
Yeah, that one's tricky in a flat pack, unfortunately.

30:31.620 --> 30:33.620
For basic stuff, obviously, it works just great.

30:33.620 --> 30:37.620
But once you need some, you know, certain runtimes or fancy config stuff.

30:37.620 --> 30:41.620
And this is true for like VS Codeium as well, if you're trying to use the non-Microsoft

30:41.620 --> 30:43.620
version, if there is such a thing.

30:43.620 --> 30:44.620
The less Microsoft.

30:44.620 --> 30:46.620
And this one is like, choose your compromise.

30:46.620 --> 30:50.620
And if you're a big VS Code user, this is really frustrating.

30:50.620 --> 30:53.620
So it doesn't work great as a flat pack because there's certain things you don't get access

30:53.620 --> 30:55.620
to, certain plugins, certain file system things.

30:55.620 --> 30:58.620
Whatever, no big deal, install it as a package.

30:58.620 --> 31:01.620
Well, that's not going to work so great, Chief.

31:01.620 --> 31:05.620
Like, say you want to install a plugin using the VS Code built-in plugin stuff.

31:05.620 --> 31:06.620
I do.

31:06.620 --> 31:08.620
There's a lot of nice plugins in there.

31:08.620 --> 31:09.620
Yeah, those extensions and whatnot.

31:09.620 --> 31:11.620
Yeah, that's not going to work, Chief.

31:11.620 --> 31:12.620
Sorry about that.

31:12.620 --> 31:13.620
You're not going to do that.

31:13.620 --> 31:17.620
In fact, if you do, you'll install some stuff that doesn't work correctly with the underlying

31:17.620 --> 31:22.620
Nix system and it's just going to get really, really shaky, really fast.

31:22.620 --> 31:25.620
There's two ways you can solve this.

31:25.620 --> 31:30.620
One that I did first and worked for a long time was just there is a VS Code with a bunch

31:30.620 --> 31:33.620
of great extensions installed and ready to go.

31:33.620 --> 31:34.620
Ready to go.

31:34.620 --> 31:35.620
Good stuff.

31:35.620 --> 31:41.620
And then if you have, like I have the VS Code sync set up, if you sync it and it supports

31:41.620 --> 31:43.620
those extensions, they'll sync over, they'll get set up on you.

31:43.620 --> 31:45.620
I had most everything I wanted.

31:45.620 --> 31:49.620
But then I got crazy and I wanted to do things like I wanted to add an extension to support

31:49.620 --> 31:51.620
.desktop files and things like that.

31:51.620 --> 31:53.620
Look at you wanting a polished system over there.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.620
Mm-hmm.

31:54.620 --> 31:57.620
And so for a moment it was all good.

31:57.620 --> 32:01.620
I installed the extension to edit.desktop files.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.620
I closed VS Code, opened it again, and the extension was gone.

32:04.620 --> 32:07.620
And I thought, oh, I thought I installed that.

32:07.620 --> 32:08.620
That's funny.

32:08.620 --> 32:09.620
Huh.

32:09.620 --> 32:10.620
No desktop file.

32:10.620 --> 32:11.620
I had to install that.

32:11.620 --> 32:12.620
Okay.

32:12.620 --> 32:13.620
Good.

32:13.620 --> 32:14.620
All right.

32:14.620 --> 32:15.620
There it is.

32:15.620 --> 32:16.620
Sweet.

32:16.620 --> 32:17.620
All right.

32:17.620 --> 32:18.620
So I close VS Code.

32:18.620 --> 32:19.620
I open it up again.

32:19.620 --> 32:20.620
The extension's gone.

32:20.620 --> 32:21.620
What the?

32:21.620 --> 32:22.620
All right.

32:22.620 --> 32:23.620
Go over to Google.

32:23.620 --> 32:26.620
VS Code Nix OS extensions not and it automatically shows not staying installed or whatever.

32:26.620 --> 32:27.620
Like, oh, okay.

32:27.620 --> 32:29.620
Once again, this is a thing, of course.

32:29.620 --> 32:35.060
So then I discovered there is a VS Code FHS compatible package.

32:35.060 --> 32:40.740
And the FHS compatible package, which is like a file system hierarchy standard or something

32:40.740 --> 32:41.740
like that.

32:41.740 --> 32:42.740
Mm-hmm.

32:42.740 --> 32:46.820
That will let you install any extension you want, any old arbitrary way you want, just

32:46.820 --> 32:48.620
like you would on a regular system.

32:48.620 --> 32:53.300
But, you know, it's little things like that that you have to catch and adapt to.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.860
And today it's VS Code.

32:55.860 --> 32:57.260
Tomorrow it might be Reaper, right?

32:57.260 --> 32:58.260
We'll just see.

32:58.260 --> 32:59.260
We'll see how that goes.

32:59.260 --> 33:01.780
It's just that element of it.

33:01.780 --> 33:06.900
My final issue, and I'm curious to know what you guys think about this one, because I feel

33:06.900 --> 33:11.060
like this is both a problem with Nix and perhaps, like, it suffers from this the least out of

33:11.060 --> 33:13.100
all the Linux distros.

33:13.100 --> 33:18.420
I'm genuinely concerned that I'm going to build up a server environment in the future

33:18.420 --> 33:21.060
around Nix OS that will deploy a bunch of stuff.

33:21.060 --> 33:24.940
I'll deploy a bunch of systems, even studio systems.

33:24.940 --> 33:29.380
And then, and I know this about myself, three, four years later, I come back to them and

33:29.380 --> 33:31.440
I cannot remember a thing about them.

33:31.440 --> 33:32.860
I can't remember anything about them.

33:32.860 --> 33:34.660
I can't remember how I put it together.

33:34.660 --> 33:36.700
I just got it set.

33:36.700 --> 33:38.220
It's locked down.

33:38.220 --> 33:40.220
It passes the build check every single time.

33:40.220 --> 33:44.220
So I just went about my day and I'm worried in a year plus I won't remember how any of

33:44.220 --> 33:46.380
this actually works.

33:46.380 --> 33:52.600
It seems like that's the downside to sort of this define it once and then leave it forever

33:52.600 --> 33:57.420
approach is if you're a guy like me who doesn't remember how this stuff worked in a year to

33:57.420 --> 34:00.220
systems a bit of a black box to you.

34:00.220 --> 34:01.980
I mean, that means it's working.

34:01.980 --> 34:06.440
I mean, I don't know if having a server you have to touch all the time is really worth

34:06.440 --> 34:09.380
the cost of, oh, I remember how to configure a server.

34:09.380 --> 34:14.660
If like you don't actually need to be configured servers all the time, which is maybe the problem.

34:14.660 --> 34:16.660
I guess it's not a bad problem to have, right?

34:16.660 --> 34:17.860
Oh gosh, it's worked so well.

34:17.860 --> 34:19.460
I haven't touched it in years.

34:19.460 --> 34:22.420
You're worried about success, which is a funny thing.

34:22.420 --> 34:23.420
Yeah, I suppose.

34:23.420 --> 34:24.740
You know, Chris, I think I'm going to catch you here.

34:24.740 --> 34:30.280
I was listening recently, very recently, in fact, in the last week or two, uh, to self

34:30.280 --> 34:36.400
hosted 67, which is the no container theory where you introduced to the self hosted audience,

34:36.400 --> 34:43.480
your idea of using Nix and this like new containerization and you said exactly the opposite of a sentence

34:43.480 --> 34:48.560
you just said, which was, Hey, I'd love to be able, you know, one of the main problems

34:48.560 --> 34:53.200
I have right now is I set up, I don't know, uh, home assistant and then it sits there

34:53.200 --> 34:55.040
for five years and I don't remember how I did it.

34:55.040 --> 34:57.480
So it takes me, you know, a whole day to get back to it.

34:57.480 --> 35:04.400
But it feels like that's partly what, you know, Nix OS is solving is that you get to

35:04.400 --> 35:08.860
configure it in a way that's readable and that you don't have to rebuild every time

35:08.860 --> 35:10.120
you just kind of run it.

35:10.120 --> 35:13.040
That's why I was thinking when I kind of couch it as maybe it's the district that suffers

35:13.040 --> 35:18.640
from this the least, because ultimately I just go look at my configuration files.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.080
I know this will not last.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.180
This is still the new Nix user in me.

35:22.180 --> 35:27.960
I am bending over backwards to keep everything in one configuration file because I like that

35:27.960 --> 35:29.400
idea.

35:29.400 --> 35:33.160
But I realize all the documentation, everybody who's been using Nix for a while says, nah,

35:33.160 --> 35:36.960
nah, break it out into sub files, break it out in individual dot Nix files.

35:36.960 --> 35:41.200
I have not done that yet, but it also means I go to one file and I can see everything

35:41.200 --> 35:47.040
about my system, everything from user groups to virtualization support to what packages

35:47.040 --> 35:48.040
are installed, right?

35:48.040 --> 35:50.560
And time zone and host name.

35:50.560 --> 35:51.560
It's everything.

35:51.560 --> 35:55.920
I also feel like, Chris, if you deploy this in more areas, especially on the server and

35:55.920 --> 36:00.180
things like that, I think you'll just be more practiced at it and you'll have to touch things,

36:00.180 --> 36:03.880
you know, maybe even the best case scenario, like once a month, let's say.

36:03.880 --> 36:08.440
And so I don't know if that knowledge or that practice will kind of atrophy for you if you

36:08.440 --> 36:10.400
have it deployed more often.

36:10.400 --> 36:13.300
So what you're saying is the solution is more Nix.

36:13.300 --> 36:15.320
That's basically what I just said, yeah.

36:15.320 --> 36:19.460
I'm thinking, yeah, we configure our Nix setup to make sure that it places like a README

36:19.460 --> 36:22.700
file on the box, you know, and then that just tells you the sort of common things you might

36:22.700 --> 36:23.700
want to do in the future.

36:23.700 --> 36:25.240
Like, oh, here's how you do updates.

36:25.240 --> 36:27.940
Here's how you, you know, you're trying to add a package real quick.

36:27.940 --> 36:28.940
Don't do it this way.

36:28.940 --> 36:31.440
I don't know if you're joking, but I actually think that's a great idea.

36:31.440 --> 36:34.680
I can't tell, but I like it.

36:34.680 --> 36:40.760
And remember that, you know, Nick Slang supports comments.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.640
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

36:42.640 --> 36:46.360
Go there to get started with a free trial for a team or yourself and support the show.

36:46.360 --> 36:50.160
It's bitwarden.com slash Linux.

36:50.160 --> 36:54.800
If you're not using Bitwarden, I'm a little concerned about you because it is the easiest

36:54.800 --> 37:00.520
way out there for an individual or a business to store, share and sync sensitive data.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.600
They have a really secure system.

37:02.600 --> 37:03.600
It's all open source.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.080
It's trusted by a community of millions.

37:06.080 --> 37:10.480
It's what Wes and I use to manage our passwords, our two factor codes, you know, other sensitive

37:10.480 --> 37:14.200
data like Element has a recovery key component.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.200
Some of my wallets do.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.380
You can put those in there too.

37:17.380 --> 37:21.480
Bitwarden also has super slick account switching support so I can switch between my work stuff

37:21.480 --> 37:23.560
and my personal stuff.

37:23.560 --> 37:26.520
And one of the things that gives me confidence to use Bitwarden is there is a self hosting

37:26.520 --> 37:30.960
option if you would need it that is maintained by the community, but Bitwarden works upstream

37:30.960 --> 37:32.640
with them too.

37:32.640 --> 37:35.600
The great thing is though, I've never really felt the need.

37:35.600 --> 37:39.520
I think Bitwarden is such a great value and such an obvious service and they do client

37:39.520 --> 37:40.600
side encryption.

37:40.600 --> 37:43.640
To me it's just always made a lot of sense to just go with Bitwarden directly, but I

37:43.640 --> 37:45.920
think the value proposition with Bitwarden is a no brainer.

37:45.920 --> 37:50.720
I was able to import super easily and they've been adding features that I think are fantastic

37:50.720 --> 37:53.100
like the username generator.

37:53.100 --> 37:56.400
And did you know that they have vault health reports that are available for just about

37:56.400 --> 37:57.840
any kind of plan?

37:57.840 --> 38:02.240
These health reports can be used to evaluate the security of your setup or maybe your entire

38:02.240 --> 38:04.240
organizational vault.

38:04.240 --> 38:07.400
They're always thinking about these kinds of things.

38:07.400 --> 38:11.280
It's their job 24-7 to make this work better.

38:11.280 --> 38:17.040
To make Bitwarden work for you, to make Bitwarden work for your family, or your business.

38:17.040 --> 38:18.040
So go try it out.

38:18.040 --> 38:21.320
Get started at bitwarden.com slash linux.

38:21.320 --> 38:22.920
Go see why we like it.

38:22.920 --> 38:27.080
You can import from your existing password manager, most likely, I was able to with no

38:27.080 --> 38:28.640
problem at all.

38:28.640 --> 38:33.800
Play around with the username generator and the email generator that they have now too.

38:33.800 --> 38:38.000
Create secure usernames, passwords, and email addresses for every site and service you use

38:38.000 --> 38:40.360
and then sync it across all your platforms.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.800
See what I've been talking about by going to bitwarden.com slash linux.

38:43.800 --> 38:51.480
One more time to support the show, bitwarden.com slash linux.

38:51.480 --> 38:53.680
We got some great feedback again this week.

38:53.680 --> 38:58.840
Two letters specifically that came in about last week's episode.

38:58.840 --> 39:03.240
Blooming Strong had some advice about our old server.

39:03.240 --> 39:08.360
They said, I really feel you when you say you had not finished migrating all the things

39:08.360 --> 39:09.520
off that old server.

39:09.520 --> 39:12.280
May it rest in cotton peace.

39:12.280 --> 39:17.240
Six months after getting my new server, I am still trying to migrate from the Windows

39:17.240 --> 39:22.400
box I had hosting everything, Docker Desktop, WSL, etc.

39:22.400 --> 39:27.280
And there's just a few things that are simply too hard or not interesting enough for me

39:27.280 --> 39:28.280
to have done yet.

39:28.280 --> 39:30.480
The migration struggle is real.

39:30.480 --> 39:31.760
I hear that.

39:31.760 --> 39:36.240
And then I also thought, you know, this could be a great opportunity to like maybe I keep

39:36.240 --> 39:43.760
my private stuff on the old server and I just put work stuff on the new server.

39:43.760 --> 39:47.320
Separation of work and personal, you know.

39:47.320 --> 39:51.920
And then honestly, I'm not going to lie to you, I'm not going to lie to you.

39:51.920 --> 39:56.520
The whole OpenSUSE, Nix OS thing, it just, it threw us for a loop.

39:56.520 --> 40:01.320
We started down the path of the lizards and then we discovered the gospel of Nix.

40:01.320 --> 40:06.040
We all accepted Nix into our hearts and now it's like accidentally deflated the lizard

40:06.040 --> 40:07.040
path.

40:07.040 --> 40:08.040
It's not intentional.

40:08.040 --> 40:13.320
No, no, it just, it took us to a different place and that just put a whole pause on the

40:13.320 --> 40:16.820
thing while we just sort of reconnoitered about the whole situation.

40:16.820 --> 40:21.640
And then next thing you know, it's the summer and we got cottonwood problems, you know.

40:21.640 --> 40:24.200
A guy just didn't foresee it.

40:24.200 --> 40:26.240
Not to mention some stray cats.

40:26.240 --> 40:28.560
Yeah, don't remind me.

40:28.560 --> 40:34.520
Jotaroid in it as well with some advice and some rather strong disagreement.

40:34.520 --> 40:38.800
Regarding searching out the colo for the servers, I tend to disagree with Chris for your use

40:38.800 --> 40:39.800
case.

40:39.800 --> 40:44.480
I was in a small business that had three racks in a colo and have some insights to share.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.520
Here are some things to consider.

40:46.520 --> 40:50.240
One, will you have after hours access?

40:50.240 --> 40:56.240
Two, likely you'll have to provide your own internet circus into the colo or if not, I'm

40:56.240 --> 40:58.800
sure you'll end up paying for bandwidth.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.520
Three, need something done?

41:01.520 --> 41:05.480
Well smart hands in quotes will cost you.

41:05.480 --> 41:10.560
Number four, you'll want a KVM so you can access the console remotely in the event the

41:10.560 --> 41:14.480
server doesn't power on, even if you have a ILO or equivalent.

41:14.480 --> 41:19.200
Five, you'll need some switches in there also and some ports as you'll now need more ports

41:19.200 --> 41:21.640
for the KVM, ILO ports, etc.

41:21.640 --> 41:26.440
Six, it's going to take you several days to move all the equipment and get it set up.

41:26.440 --> 41:31.160
Seven, and likely to get a good deal, you'll either be in a sketch part of town or be with

41:31.160 --> 41:36.360
a small provider and what happens if or when they lose their lease.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.360
Number eight, don't forget a label maker.

41:38.360 --> 41:43.040
You'll want things clearly labeled so you can help either Brent or Wes or someone who's

41:43.040 --> 41:48.480
helping troubleshoot remotely or the smart hands at the colo to do things.

41:48.480 --> 41:53.860
And lastly, number nine, rack elevation diagrams become critical as you'll have a lot less

41:53.860 --> 41:55.480
access to the equipment.

41:55.480 --> 42:00.340
Instead, I recommend spending the time and money on adding AC and fans and filters to

42:00.340 --> 42:03.720
your existing rack and close the door to not let the cats in.

42:03.720 --> 42:14.300
Okay, all right, geez, I have to say that gave me a lot of flashbacks, Joe, to life

42:14.300 --> 42:15.300
in colo town.

42:15.300 --> 42:19.520
Now, I didn't have to go to a bad part of town, so I didn't have that experience.

42:19.520 --> 42:26.320
Downtown Everett had a really great data center back in my day, but literally everything else

42:26.320 --> 42:30.400
you said rings 100% true.

42:30.400 --> 42:33.680
I forgot what a pain in the neck it used to be.

42:33.680 --> 42:41.320
And I thought, I just assumed like an animal, by 2022, you weren't having to pay separately

42:41.320 --> 42:46.840
for your power and your bandwidth in a colo anymore, because I remember a time when we

42:46.840 --> 42:50.360
were paying like a thousand bucks a month for a megabit.

42:50.360 --> 42:51.360
It was bad.

42:51.360 --> 42:55.480
And then, yeah, you have to pay for your power.

42:55.480 --> 42:56.480
You do need a KVM.

42:56.480 --> 42:59.080
You do need everything labeled.

42:59.080 --> 43:02.160
I got a label maker, so we're good there, but okay, all right, so we got one thing figured

43:02.160 --> 43:03.160
out.

43:03.160 --> 43:04.160
Yeah.

43:04.160 --> 43:09.440
I've also just made peace with offloading bits to Linode and to LadyJupes.

43:09.440 --> 43:16.160
But LadyJupes, the data center on LadyJupes is a booth in a dinette, okay?

43:16.160 --> 43:21.080
And it's probably, I don't know, I could look it up, I could actually tell you right now

43:21.080 --> 43:25.840
as we're doing the show, but it gets hot in there, even on a cool day when it's not that

43:25.840 --> 43:26.840
hot out.

43:26.840 --> 43:29.880
It can take days for the temperature of that thing to come down.

43:29.880 --> 43:34.080
All right, so we're going to need to rig up a micro AC unit just for the booth.

43:34.080 --> 43:36.520
Yeah, or some sort of vent.

43:36.520 --> 43:37.520
I don't know.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.040
I'll look it up right now as we're doing the show.

43:40.040 --> 43:50.560
My server room temperature in LadyJupes is 86.9 degrees with a high of 88.1 at 11 PM.

43:50.560 --> 43:54.080
So that's pretty good considering, because if you go look at the longer history, you

43:54.080 --> 43:57.960
can see she's been averaging around 90 degrees Fahrenheit.

43:57.960 --> 43:58.960
It's not been good.

43:58.960 --> 44:00.120
That's a little toasty.

44:00.120 --> 44:01.320
It's not been good at all.

44:01.320 --> 44:08.240
And so these devices, like if they are x86, I don't know if they can handle that, right?

44:08.240 --> 44:11.040
But these Raspberry Pis, they keep going, right?

44:11.040 --> 44:15.600
So I've moved some of my media functionality directly into Jupes, and then some of the

44:15.600 --> 44:19.040
batch processing functionality I put on Linode, and we have, it's back.

44:19.040 --> 44:20.460
The system is back.

44:20.460 --> 44:21.500
It seems to be functional.

44:21.500 --> 44:23.320
The updates passed from last week's episode.

44:23.320 --> 44:24.320
They sure did.

44:24.320 --> 44:28.440
But we have it off because it's still 80-ish out there, and so we're just leaving it off

44:28.440 --> 44:30.040
for now, now that I've set up other stuff.

44:30.040 --> 44:34.760
But as the temps come back down, which they will here in the Pacific Northwest, we'll

44:34.760 --> 44:36.680
bring things back locally.

44:36.680 --> 44:39.760
Maybe I'll put a pause on the colo idea because Joe literally just scared the crap out of

44:39.760 --> 44:40.760
me.

44:40.760 --> 44:42.720
There's a lot to manage, yeah, definitely.

44:42.720 --> 44:46.280
Joe even had one last idea for us, a little bonus idea.

44:46.280 --> 44:52.720
He said, hey, you should include some of the cottonwood cotton in your geocaches.

44:52.720 --> 44:53.720
That's hilarious.

44:53.720 --> 44:56.260
We totally have enough.

44:56.260 --> 44:58.200
Go wipe the drives, you know?

44:58.200 --> 45:01.040
Let's get that JB server set.

45:01.040 --> 45:02.040
It could.

45:02.040 --> 45:05.520
Well, given what you said, I don't think it's a good one.

45:05.520 --> 45:08.520
No, it just depends on which batch you get.

45:08.520 --> 45:10.000
You got to get it from the right section.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.000
Lots of fresh stuff.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.160
Yeah, not the stuff in that one corner.

45:13.160 --> 45:18.360
Andrew wrote in as well with a quick little note as a new fan.

45:18.360 --> 45:20.400
Just discovered your podcast, loving this.

45:20.400 --> 45:29.480
I'm ye olde Unix user, started in 82 with the source code to V7 on a 1200 BPI tape and

45:29.480 --> 45:31.640
a new copy of K&R.

45:31.640 --> 45:33.280
I found my tribe.

45:33.280 --> 45:34.720
Oh, nice.

45:34.720 --> 45:35.720
That's great.

45:35.720 --> 45:36.720
Welcome, Andrew.

45:36.720 --> 45:37.720
Welcome in, Andrew.

45:37.720 --> 45:42.200
You know, I don't even really have references for any of what he just said, so I feel lost.

45:42.200 --> 45:44.320
He should join the matrix and explain it to you.

45:44.320 --> 45:49.320
Smithy wrote in as well, hey, your new open source community website on GitHub is a fantastic

45:49.320 --> 45:51.360
project.

45:51.360 --> 45:55.000
Thank you very much, which is going great, by the way.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.820
Why don't you really walk the talk and do your community engagement with real open source

45:58.820 --> 46:04.680
platforms like diaspora, friendica, mastodon, rather than convenient restricted platforms

46:04.680 --> 46:06.520
like Discord or matrix?

46:06.520 --> 46:07.520
Is matrix restricted?

46:07.520 --> 46:11.440
Well, that's one of my questions there.

46:11.440 --> 46:14.320
We run our own matrix, is that restricted?

46:14.320 --> 46:17.400
That feels pretty good to me, actually, feels pretty good.

46:17.400 --> 46:22.160
I included this, and Chris, there's a little triggering note here for you.

46:22.160 --> 46:27.760
The email they wrote in on was postmaster at localhost.local, so of course I wasn't

46:27.760 --> 46:32.580
able to send a thoughtful reply, which I think is a note.

46:32.580 --> 46:39.000
We sometimes get feedback like this from people who discourage the back and forth dialogue.

46:39.000 --> 46:44.320
I want to have a real conversation and to suggest reasons why, of course, we've thought

46:44.320 --> 46:48.160
of this stuff and made certain choices.

46:48.160 --> 46:51.200
So unfortunately, I can't do that, but I guess we'll do it here.

46:51.200 --> 46:52.920
Any quick thoughts, gentlemen?

46:52.920 --> 46:56.200
So I don't know if I agree on matrix.

46:56.200 --> 46:57.880
I think that's probably fine.

46:57.880 --> 47:04.360
I like mastodon, but I have found that I don't really like mastodon as a social, just general

47:04.360 --> 47:05.360
website.

47:05.360 --> 47:08.160
I found it to be really useful when it's project specific.

47:08.160 --> 47:12.400
I've been around, tried out mastodon over the years, never really stuck until finally

47:12.400 --> 47:17.640
I joined the podcasting 2.0 mastodon, where it's really kind of mission specific.

47:17.640 --> 47:20.400
That makes sense to me for a social media platform.

47:20.400 --> 47:22.840
I don't really have any need to have a JB mastodon.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.240
I don't really think it's necessary.

47:24.240 --> 47:26.920
There's plenty of other ones out there, so it's just not something we've really engaged

47:26.920 --> 47:27.920
in.

47:27.920 --> 47:28.920
We've put our focus on matrix.

47:28.920 --> 47:29.920
Right.

47:29.920 --> 47:30.920
Yeah, we don't really...

47:30.920 --> 47:37.320
There's not, at the moment anyway, a JB social, you know, like a dedicated staff member whose

47:37.320 --> 47:39.520
job it is to manage the JB social.

47:39.520 --> 47:43.320
So it's just really not like a platform that ends up where we are super, right?

47:43.320 --> 47:45.440
Because there's, I mean, we have an awesome telegram room.

47:45.440 --> 47:48.000
We've got, there's an awesome self hosted discord room.

47:48.000 --> 47:50.680
There's a thriving matrix community.

47:50.680 --> 47:54.120
And there's already too many notifications there for me to keep up with.

47:54.120 --> 47:56.020
Plus we've got booths, we've got emails.

47:56.020 --> 48:00.760
So hopefully there's good ways for people to reach us and have dialogues when interested.

48:00.760 --> 48:04.160
And then we just kind of have to make some practical choices of where are the most people,

48:04.160 --> 48:10.000
where's the best place we can get that good experience and get to engage with the audience,

48:10.000 --> 48:12.440
but still make the most effective use of time.

48:12.440 --> 48:13.440
Yeah.

48:13.440 --> 48:16.880
And I think that also is the logic behind the choice of using something like GitHub

48:16.880 --> 48:20.060
over GitLab or something like that.

48:20.060 --> 48:23.320
We want to reach the most amount of people for that particular project.

48:23.320 --> 48:27.840
And we think that's how our influence and reach can be best served.

48:27.840 --> 48:32.240
But the nice thing is, is we're also pretty comfortable with the idea that if we're ever,

48:32.240 --> 48:35.800
I don't know, motivated, we would just move off of GitHub.

48:35.800 --> 48:37.880
I don't think that would take us more than an afternoon.

48:37.880 --> 48:40.000
So we're not particularly worried about it.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.000
What are your thoughts, Brent?

48:41.000 --> 48:43.360
Yeah, I think you hit it with the GitHub stuff.

48:43.360 --> 48:48.000
I was relatively new to GitHub when we first started this project and they didn't mention

48:48.000 --> 48:51.680
this directly, but I think that was kind of, you know, between the lines was, well, why'd

48:51.680 --> 48:53.600
you choose GitHub as well?

48:53.600 --> 48:58.400
And we've touched on this previously, I think possibly in office hours.

48:58.400 --> 49:03.520
And it was really balancing, you know, the ideals that we may have, because of course

49:03.520 --> 49:08.560
we have some, and we somewhat feel the same way, but with where the people are.

49:08.560 --> 49:14.340
And in GitHub's case, I think also like a skill that you can get, a really great skill

49:14.340 --> 49:17.500
that you can add to your employment experience.

49:17.500 --> 49:21.840
That's one of the perks of our community, you know, contributors, is they're working

49:21.840 --> 49:23.920
on something they can put on a resume.

49:23.920 --> 49:29.440
And so to best serve that and then, you know, GitHub is the place you can send recruiters

49:29.440 --> 49:31.680
to get your own GitLab or instance like that.

49:31.680 --> 49:37.160
But there's like, you know, not a lot of culture and community adoption in the hiring practices

49:37.160 --> 49:38.160
around that.

49:38.160 --> 49:39.160
I would think.

49:39.160 --> 49:40.160
I think everybody's tuned for GitHub.

49:40.160 --> 49:41.160
I mean, yes and no.

49:41.160 --> 49:43.720
I think that's a, that's part of the filter on the larger part.

49:43.720 --> 49:47.920
I don't think if you're actually talking to a hiring manager, then no, a link to a project

49:47.920 --> 49:48.920
is probably what's effective.

49:48.920 --> 49:49.920
Sure, sure, yeah.

49:49.920 --> 49:50.920
Right, I'm thinking like when you're...

49:50.920 --> 49:55.120
That's a great way to say, look at these interactions with the community where looking at pull requests

49:55.120 --> 49:57.240
and issues is quite common.

49:57.240 --> 50:01.280
If somebody is just like looking at your resume, right, and they're casually googling you,

50:01.280 --> 50:04.460
right, they're going to look at GitHub links and stuff.

50:04.460 --> 50:05.460
That's my thought.

50:05.460 --> 50:10.740
And so as a bit of value that the community gets by spending time working on our open

50:10.740 --> 50:15.000
source projects, they can then demonstrate, hey, look, this is real work I did.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
Here's the actual commits.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.840
Like, that's super valuable for them.

50:17.840 --> 50:18.840
Yeah, and for us.

50:18.840 --> 50:25.040
Well, and I also feel like it's a neat experiment from our perspective to see sort of what Microsoft

50:25.040 --> 50:29.880
has done with what was, you know, an open source safe haven for so many projects and

50:29.880 --> 50:31.200
what are they doing now?

50:31.200 --> 50:35.540
What have they integrated into it that could inform maybe some of our content as well?

50:35.540 --> 50:37.320
So I'm seeing it from that angle sometimes.

50:37.320 --> 50:40.880
It did force us all to kind of refresh our familiarity with GitHub.

50:40.880 --> 50:41.880
That's been...

50:41.880 --> 50:43.300
Yeah, but good questions.

50:43.300 --> 50:50.200
If you'd like to send in an email, go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

50:50.200 --> 50:53.080
And now it is time for the boost.

50:53.080 --> 50:54.280
So we're trying something new.

50:54.280 --> 50:57.660
You know, the boosts are a brand new segment and we're always adapting.

50:57.660 --> 51:00.620
This is a concept that came up in office hours that we're trying out for a bit.

51:00.620 --> 51:04.560
We're going to do like the top boosts, not really based on the amount you boost in, but

51:04.560 --> 51:08.920
it'll just be, we'll read all of the boosts, 100% of them, and then we'll select a few

51:08.920 --> 51:12.240
to come onto the show, you know, a good signal.

51:12.240 --> 51:14.520
And we just want to say thank you to everybody who does boost in.

51:14.520 --> 51:18.680
And then we'll also, as you heard earlier, we'll read the baller boost separately in

51:18.680 --> 51:21.640
the show, kind of break it up, keep things moving.

51:21.640 --> 51:27.560
And our first boost came in from a guy named Dude with 10,001 sets.

51:27.560 --> 51:29.200
Coming in hot with the boost.

51:29.200 --> 51:33.160
He says, I hereby suggest that there should be a 10,000 set minimum for guaranteed reads

51:33.160 --> 51:34.160
on the show.

51:34.160 --> 51:37.280
So this has been something we've been thinking about and this is where the top four, top

51:37.280 --> 51:42.560
five boosts, and we'll pull a few in every episode.

51:42.560 --> 51:43.640
We'll read all of them.

51:43.640 --> 51:46.820
We're also, just so you guys know, behind the scenes, we're going to work on systems

51:46.820 --> 51:51.200
to make sure that every host sees every boost that comes in for each one of the shows.

51:51.200 --> 51:55.220
They're all still coming into myself and Brent right now because he is still getting a split.

51:55.220 --> 51:56.980
So we see all of those as well.

51:56.980 --> 52:01.880
And so instead of setting it based on a 10,000 set minimum, maybe we'll try that one day.

52:01.880 --> 52:04.680
We're just going to base it on quality of boost.

52:04.680 --> 52:08.440
And then we just hope that you contribute the amount that you think represents the value

52:08.440 --> 52:10.280
you get from the show.

52:10.280 --> 52:16.680
Like Optimus Gray did with a row of Mic Ducks, 22,222 sats.

52:16.680 --> 52:18.400
This old duck still got it.

52:18.400 --> 52:23.800
He says, oh my, now I have a great Jupiter.2 portable system.

52:23.800 --> 52:24.800
Get ready for this.

52:24.800 --> 52:25.800
This is brilliant.

52:25.800 --> 52:26.800
I'm going to try this.

52:26.800 --> 52:29.840
The Steam Deck, the speakers are nice.

52:29.840 --> 52:31.680
The screen is great.

52:31.680 --> 52:34.280
It's got a built in trackpad mouse.

52:34.280 --> 52:36.080
It's got a keyboard.

52:36.080 --> 52:41.160
He uses it for SSH as well and he just added Jupiter.2 to his launcher, which that's the

52:41.160 --> 52:43.180
magic sauce I hadn't thought of.

52:43.180 --> 52:46.920
That's a great idea because it's got a full Chromium based browser on there.

52:46.920 --> 52:51.640
He could participate in the P2P stream from a Steam Deck.

52:51.640 --> 52:52.640
That's great.

52:52.640 --> 52:55.720
He says, I also just submitted a ticket for tail scale to get tail scale running on the

52:55.720 --> 52:56.720
Steam Deck.

52:56.720 --> 52:57.720
Yeah.

52:57.720 --> 52:58.720
Hmm.

52:58.720 --> 53:00.560
I don't think I'll install Bitwarden, but he could.

53:00.560 --> 53:01.560
Yeah.

53:01.560 --> 53:02.560
You know, any flat pack.

53:02.560 --> 53:06.920
I feel like I haven't done it yet because I've just been, I don't know this sounds weird,

53:06.920 --> 53:10.680
but I've just been using the Steam Deck to play video games and I haven't really felt

53:10.680 --> 53:13.200
super compelled to tinker with it beyond getting emulators on there.

53:13.200 --> 53:15.680
I thought you were going to install Windows.

53:15.680 --> 53:18.600
It did for like 22 seconds cross my mind.

53:18.600 --> 53:19.600
Just to try it.

53:19.600 --> 53:20.600
Just to try it.

53:20.600 --> 53:23.840
But then I thought, you know, it would be, it would be, it would be kind of great to

53:23.840 --> 53:26.240
try to get the Nix package manager on here.

53:26.240 --> 53:28.040
I saw that coming.

53:28.040 --> 53:29.440
I haven't done it yet.

53:29.440 --> 53:32.600
I think that might be the next thing that I do, but we'll see right now.

53:32.600 --> 53:35.360
I'm just going to play video games for a bit and enjoy it for that.

53:35.360 --> 53:41.560
Well our next boost is from Mississippi Mayhem with a row of ducks.

53:41.560 --> 53:42.560
Hey all.

53:42.560 --> 53:46.920
I've been a huge fan since way back when a certain someone lost a bet and had to wear

53:46.920 --> 53:49.480
a certain costume for the show.

53:49.480 --> 53:51.280
If you know, you know on that one.

53:51.280 --> 53:56.000
In all that time, I don't remember ever having a JB meetup within a day's drive.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.000
Oh gosh.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
Sorry, Mississippi.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.000
That's, that's too bad.

53:59.000 --> 54:05.000
So Mississippi goes on to ask, how many people when I have to get together to convince y'all

54:05.000 --> 54:08.840
to do an official Mississippi JB meetup?

54:08.840 --> 54:10.880
Best wishes from Mississippi.

54:10.880 --> 54:12.800
And a little PS for you here, Chris.

54:12.800 --> 54:14.760
PS, unfilter, reboot when?

54:14.760 --> 54:19.520
Oh man, all my, all my non-JB energy right now has been going into Bitcoin dad pod.

54:19.520 --> 54:22.880
That's really where I've been focused because I feel like a lot of the macro stuff we talk

54:22.880 --> 54:27.640
about in Bitcoin dad pod is really what I would have been talking about in unfilter

54:27.640 --> 54:32.120
anyways, but it just now is based on economics and macro picture and not so much just like

54:32.120 --> 54:33.120
the news cycle.

54:33.120 --> 54:36.680
Well there, if you need a little more Chris Fisher, B dad pod's the place to go.

54:36.680 --> 54:40.520
You know, Patrick also boosted in, in the greater Nashville area saying he'd be down

54:40.520 --> 54:41.520
for a meetup.

54:41.520 --> 54:45.280
This is something Brett and I have been noticing is we're getting more and more people writing

54:45.280 --> 54:49.800
in saying they'd be willing to just meet up even if the JB crew can't make it.

54:49.800 --> 54:53.080
And so we've started a conversation in office hours on like, how the hell do we facilitate

54:53.080 --> 54:54.080
this?

54:54.080 --> 54:55.080
Cause this is a brilliant idea.

54:55.080 --> 54:59.160
These meetups are awesome and they can, you know, like they can really be just recharging

54:59.160 --> 55:00.160
for your work.

55:00.160 --> 55:03.560
Like if you're in IT, you're in the tech spec, you're a developer, you're just in the sector

55:03.560 --> 55:10.280
and you're a little burned out, you go to these meetups, you really kind of get recharged

55:10.280 --> 55:14.100
and I don't know, I feel like that would be a great social service if we could help organize

55:14.100 --> 55:15.100
that kind of stuff.

55:15.100 --> 55:16.100
Yeah, right.

55:16.100 --> 55:18.960
Network, recharge, just be around some, some people who have the same interests as you

55:18.960 --> 55:20.080
and want to talk about it.

55:20.080 --> 55:21.080
It's so nice.

55:21.080 --> 55:23.920
We need a platform because obviously going through us on air, that's not going to scale.

55:23.920 --> 55:24.920
That's not going to scale, no.

55:24.920 --> 55:28.160
So we need a way, we would do like a webpage or something that people go to, they register

55:28.160 --> 55:30.960
their area, register their willingness to like do a meetup.

55:30.960 --> 55:34.720
People can organize, swipe left, I don't know what it is, but you know, something that they

55:34.720 --> 55:36.680
could do to kind of self organize.

55:36.680 --> 55:38.800
I think that'd be really what we need next.

55:38.800 --> 55:40.700
So if anybody has any ideas, let us know.

55:40.700 --> 55:44.920
So we got folks in the Mississippi area and we got folks in the Nashville area.

55:44.920 --> 55:48.280
We've also, we've also heard from some folks in the Raleigh area that would like to continue

55:48.280 --> 55:50.840
meetups going, the London area.

55:50.840 --> 55:52.600
So there's a lot of different areas.

55:52.600 --> 55:56.320
We just need to get it all kind of figured out because these can be really, really beneficial

55:56.320 --> 55:57.320
for the community.

55:57.320 --> 56:04.160
Well, boosting on, CERBIC boosts in with another row of ducks.

56:04.160 --> 56:05.680
Thanks for another awesome show.

56:05.680 --> 56:10.080
As someone who's looking to put together a home server in a pretty warm part of the world,

56:10.080 --> 56:14.560
I feel for you going through all the woes, but I'm also thankful that I can learn from

56:14.560 --> 56:15.560
it all.

56:15.560 --> 56:16.560
Yeah.

56:16.560 --> 56:19.040
Hopefully you're learning what not to do on that one there.

56:19.040 --> 56:20.040
Yeah.

56:20.040 --> 56:24.280
You know what, building for the heat, you know what's even trickier?

56:24.280 --> 56:27.920
Is building something that works really great in the freezing cold and something that works

56:27.920 --> 56:29.240
really great in the super hot.

56:29.240 --> 56:31.240
That is very tricky for extreme weather.

56:31.240 --> 56:32.240
Okay.

56:32.240 --> 56:37.080
And another boost this time from our friend Nev with 6,258 sats.

56:37.080 --> 56:38.080
Boost!

56:38.080 --> 56:39.080
Okay.

56:39.080 --> 56:43.800
So this is in response to us figuring out boost amounts to read on the show and his

56:43.800 --> 56:46.240
process for deciding how much to boost.

56:46.240 --> 56:47.240
Yeah.

56:47.240 --> 56:48.240
Okay.

56:48.240 --> 56:53.960
So 6,258 is equal to the number of pies I have that are running Slackware.

56:53.960 --> 56:58.640
Which if you divide 6,258 is equal to the approximate total number of physical floppies

56:58.640 --> 57:03.160
you need a single copy of to install every version of Slackware Linux from initial to

57:03.160 --> 57:04.160
5.0.

57:04.160 --> 57:06.760
Don't ask me how accurate I am here.

57:06.760 --> 57:09.080
I'm guessing, I'm going to say he's accurate.

57:09.080 --> 57:10.560
I feels right.

57:10.560 --> 57:17.480
Also 6,258 is special because it's 1993 times 3.14 rounded to the nearest whole number.

57:17.480 --> 57:18.480
Okay.

57:18.480 --> 57:19.480
Expect more in the future.

57:19.480 --> 57:20.480
Is that a threat?

57:20.480 --> 57:21.480
It's something.

57:21.480 --> 57:22.480
I think so.

57:22.480 --> 57:23.480
Thanks Nev.

57:23.480 --> 57:28.440
Nev that's way more complicated than I expected but I love it and I appreciate you rolling

57:28.440 --> 57:31.440
with the curveballs as we send those in.

57:31.440 --> 57:34.580
We got a lot of boosts that did make it on air this week but I do want to just shout

57:34.580 --> 57:35.580
out to a few.

57:35.580 --> 57:38.840
These are not all of them that did not make it but we did read all of them.

57:38.840 --> 57:42.920
But we got 4,096 sats from 412 Linux.

57:42.920 --> 57:45.600
He was thanking us for an extra long live stream.

57:45.600 --> 57:48.520
He's a member who boosts in from time to time.

57:48.520 --> 57:50.080
We felt irresponsible but glad you liked it.

57:50.080 --> 57:52.400
I think it was three hours or something last week.

57:52.400 --> 57:53.400
Yeah.

57:53.400 --> 57:54.400
There's a lot of show.

57:54.400 --> 57:57.360
We don't always do them that long but every now and then they go pretty long.

57:57.360 --> 58:00.980
I thought we had a really great discussion about the Pine64 Manjaro situation in our

58:00.980 --> 58:03.080
member feed this week.

58:03.080 --> 58:08.200
We got 9,216 sats from the Mad Hatter who was sending Brent burnout money.

58:08.200 --> 58:10.720
Does that mean I get a new car?

58:10.720 --> 58:13.720
You just get a little extra gas for you to drive crazy I think.

58:13.720 --> 58:14.720
Oh alright.

58:14.720 --> 58:15.920
It's a little heavier on the pedal.

58:15.920 --> 58:17.140
And replace them tires.

58:17.140 --> 58:20.280
We got a few boosts in that were for Brent gas money that just didn't make it on the

58:20.280 --> 58:21.280
air.

58:21.280 --> 58:22.280
Thank you.

58:22.280 --> 58:25.080
But I was researching last night how we're going to do this, like how you're actually

58:25.080 --> 58:29.600
going to convert the sats that are sitting on your node into actual gasoline.

58:29.600 --> 58:31.760
I think I've come up with a really easy workflow.

58:31.760 --> 58:32.760
Does it involve a Pi?

58:32.760 --> 58:36.360
Oh I was hoping for a weird, complicated workflow.

58:36.360 --> 58:37.360
I also have that.

58:37.360 --> 58:38.360
Okay.

58:38.360 --> 58:39.360
Yeah.

58:39.360 --> 58:40.360
I've come up with like three routes that we can take.

58:40.360 --> 58:41.360
Let's hear it.

58:41.360 --> 58:45.400
No, I'll discuss them with you after the show because we got to keep moving, but yeah.

58:45.400 --> 58:46.760
I got them figured out.

58:46.760 --> 58:52.380
I wanted to just call out SU or CD who boosted in with just 222 sats, we love all mounts,

58:52.380 --> 58:53.380
and he's using Boost CLI.

58:53.380 --> 58:54.380
Oh, look at you.

58:54.380 --> 58:55.380
Yeah.

58:55.380 --> 58:59.280
I mean that's a command line client, you got to have your own node, it's very, very, very

58:59.280 --> 59:00.280
geeky.

59:00.280 --> 59:07.280
2,222 sats with no message from RustaCastaVersa, but I just wanted to make sure he remembered.

59:07.280 --> 59:09.680
I am now pronouncing it that way officially.

59:09.680 --> 59:13.280
We also got a row of ducks from Mr. Quackers.

59:13.280 --> 59:15.240
Quacka Wacka, it's a treasure.

59:15.240 --> 59:16.240
Yippee.

59:16.240 --> 59:20.000
And then we got a long time listener who boosted him from Finland with his first boost ever.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Nice to see you.

59:21.000 --> 59:22.000
How great is that?

59:22.000 --> 59:27.240
And then another 2,000 sats came in from MegaStrike for some Brent Gas Money because yes, the

59:27.240 --> 59:29.480
split is still set up.

59:29.480 --> 59:31.680
I'll probably be rearranging the splits in the future.

59:31.680 --> 59:37.640
I'll keep Brent in the split, but I'm looking at some more open source free software foundations

59:37.640 --> 59:40.080
and projects that we can add to our splits.

59:40.080 --> 59:43.240
So we'll be rearranging the splits in the near future and some of the splits will be

59:43.240 --> 59:47.240
going to a deserving project, which is under evaluation.

59:47.240 --> 59:51.040
So if you have any ideas of projects of lightning addresses, give me their names by boosting

59:51.040 --> 59:52.040
them in.

59:52.040 --> 59:55.160
Feel free to go check out some new podcasting 2.0 apps.

59:55.160 --> 01:00:00.000
Some of the great features include boostagrams, chapters, hosts, info, sat streaming, search

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.320
value and clips as well.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:06.220
And a quick note, if you search hard in our GitHub projects, someone's working on some

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:08.640
translations that might show up there too.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.960
So those are great.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:15.400
And if you're interested in being super geeky with Boost CLI, you can use the command line

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:19.040
tool to send and review podcasting 2.0 value as well.

01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:22.960
And I'm sure Chris will call out your name for using that.

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.400
I do love to see it.

01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:29.920
Newpodcastapps.com for a list of them, including apps that don't require you switch your MP3

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920
player.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.960
Although I've been hearing from a lot of people trying out Podverse and Fountain.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.520
I think people are loving them.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.520
Okay.

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.520
How about picks?

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.960
I got some picks for you.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.840
I had a hard time this week because I tried to go on theme, but I just really couldn't

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:48.400
find anything that we haven't already done that I thought was worth talking about for

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.400
this particular theme.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.520
So I decided to break from the theme and this is a pick for you, Westpain.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.520
Oh, for me?

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:56.240
This is a personal pick for you.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.240
Personal pick.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.240
I'm honored.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.240
Maybe other people will be benefited.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.240
Maybe they'll benefit from this.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.240
I don't know.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:06.760
You and I were talking recently and you said something that caught my ears and that was,

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:11.760
you know, maybe I ought to try building a gaming rig and maybe I ought to use Nyx as

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:12.760
the base.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:13.760
Remember?

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:16.760
Well, I remember asking you, you know, for thoughts on what distribution I should put

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.760
it.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.760
And I said you should use Nyx.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.760
Yeah.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.760
You didn't volunteer that.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.760
And I didn't object.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:22.760
I did not object.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.760
Yeah.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.760
Yeah.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.760
Okay.

01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:26.760
So yeah, I remember that.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.760
Fair.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:28.760
And I said I actually think you would like it because I've been trying it and I've been

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:33.160
living the Flatpak lifestyle with Steam and there's another tool that I'm making a personal

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.480
pick for you.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.380
It's the Heroic Games Launcher.

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:42.480
And what I love about this is it combines Epic Games and GOG Games in one launcher.

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:46.120
You don't have to go get their individual Windows apps or run them under WINE.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.760
Because I don't really want to do that.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:48.760
Right.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:49.800
It's one app to manage all of them.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.640
There's several tools like this for Linux gaming and of course there is a Flatpak for

01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:55.880
this so you can get it installed in just mere moments.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.080
Yeah, that makes it easy.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.760
You connect it to your Epic Games account if you have such a thing, which they have

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:04.160
some good games, or your GOG account which you I'm sure have.

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.160
I do.

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.160
It syncs it.

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:08.600
It downloads and installs it just like their own launchers do and then you just run it

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.160
there on your box.

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:14.240
It is the heroicgameslauncher.com and we'll have a link in the show notes for that.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:17.840
And it's just one of the things that just makes it really easy, immutable distro or

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:22.520
not, to just get all your games installed for things that are just outside of Steam.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.000
Because it turns out Steam doesn't have all the games.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
It's not everything.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.120
It's like most things these days, but it's not quite everything.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:30.840
And of course there's other great launchers out there that do other things.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:33.480
But this is the one we're going to give a little love to this week.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:37.560
But if you've got one you'd like to suggest, you can boost it in or go to linuxunplug.com

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:40.740
slash contact and let us know.

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:41.740
Well thanks for the pick.

01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:42.740
Yeah.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:45.300
I'll definitely give it a try and I guess thanks for helping me waste a little more

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.420
of my own time.

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:48.600
I think it'd be great to see you build a gaming rig.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.200
Would you go high-end graphics?

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.200
I'm tempted.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.200
Are you?

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.840
I mean it seems like maybe now might be the time the graphics cards, you know, is a little

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.840
more normal.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.840
Coming down a little bit.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:02:59.840
Not crazy anymore.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:00.840
Not as crazy anymore.

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:01.840
Yeah.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:02.840
Hmm.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.760
I'd really, well if you do, you got to let us know how it goes and tell us, you know,

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.560
tell us what you decided to do.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.820
We'd love to have you join us live.

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:14.480
We get together every single Sunday at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern over at jupyter.tube.

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:15.800
Also thank you to our members.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.520
You can become a member at unpluggedcore.com.

01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:22.800
They keep us oriented towards our audience, not only from like a host standpoint, but

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.880
from a business standpoint.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:27.880
It's sort of like the peanut butter and the jelly that go together.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.320
And so they are immensely valuable.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.300
As a thank you, we make some feeds available to them.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:36.200
We make an ad-free fully produced version that Drew puts together and we make a live

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:40.440
feed version, which is all the mistakes.

01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.440
There's a lot of those.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.200
All the screw-ups if they happen, you know, us getting connected with people if they're

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.200
joining us this week.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:50.180
And then a big part of it is the pre and post show, which is like a whole other show really.

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:53.540
And we make that available to our members, unpluggedcore.com.

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:56.080
Or you can support all the shows on the network.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:00.600
Get access to all of the benefits for all the shows and get Linux action news ad-free

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.600
at jupyter.party.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.160
Come join the party.

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:04.160
Yeah.

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:05.160
It's a party over there, right?

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.160
Wes is there.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:07.160
He's partying.

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:10.560
He's also in that Linux action news, which always covers some stuff you need to know

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:11.560
about.

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:14.840
We focus really on the stuff that we feel is the most important to get captured.

01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:21.780
And then we try to break it down and explain it in a no nonsense, no fooling, no tomfoolery,

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.280
just what you need to know in and out.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.280
That's Linux action news.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.280
We don't let ourselves laugh.

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.280
That's the whole rule.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.560
There is no fun in Linux action news.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:31.800
We cut out all the laughing awkwardly.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:34.440
So that way you know we laughed, but we didn't want you to hear it.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.180
So we cut it mid-laugh.

01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.720
And that's why this show is so serious.

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.000
But the jokes are still there, right?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.040
Well, yeah, but we explain them so that way they don't sound funny.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.200
Because it's a news show, Brad.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.200
Yeah.

01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:45.200
Jokes.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.200
Jokes.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.200
All right.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.200
To find out if we're telling the truth or not, linuxactionnews.com.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.800
All right.

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:53.000
That brings us to the end of this week's broadcast.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.460
Links to what this here show talked about while that's over at our linuxunplugged.com

01:04:56.460 --> 01:04:58.600
slash what is this 472?

01:04:58.600 --> 01:04:59.600
Yes, sir.

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:00.600
Oh my God.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.600
I got it right.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:02.600
Wow.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.600
Yeah, I know.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.600
That's weird.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.600
We paid attention today.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.600
I think it's that giant counter on the wall in front of you.

01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:07.600
It's been working well.

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.840
We're going to get back from the West Coast meetups and it's going to be like time to

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:13.600
plan episode 500 time.

01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:17.000
Maybe we should survey the folks at the meetups for what we should do for our 500.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
They'll help us out.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Yeah.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.000
And send us some ideas too if you're out there.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Let us know what you think.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
All right.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.280
Well, thank you very much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:51.560
And we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

01:05:54.280 --> 01:06:06.080
I presume blue wallet is available in Canada.

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:10.660
I'm not positive, but I think that's a big presumption.

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.720
I think it's available everywhere, but I'm not sure.

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.720
Yeah.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.600
Anyways, an American would say that we need one of the many wallets.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.620
There are many, but we need, I think blue wallet would be the way to go, but we need

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:24.440
many wallets, one of many wallets that can connect directly to your node.

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:25.440
Yeah.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.440
Okay.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.920
And then they use the node's balance as their balance.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:29.400
Well, that sounds reasonable.

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:39.560
And then what we can do is we can go to bitrefill.com and there's a couple of ways you can do this,

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:44.680
but you can buy basically a gift card for anything with lightning SATs.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:51.240
So like Texas, Chevron, and then one of the Canadian gas companies up there, I forget

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.240
which one.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.240
We have some.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.240
Yeah.

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.240
There's a standard one.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:58.160
They have gift cards you can buy with Satoshis.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.160
Okay.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:01.720
Like the Chevron one requires you use their app.

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:02.720
Weird.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.840
So you got to like, you redeem it, you know?

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:05.840
You redeem it.

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:06.840
All right.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:07.840
Yeah.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:08.840
Yeah.

01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:09.840
I know.

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:10.840
So there's several options there.

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:13.680
One of three, but that's probably the one that would be like the most, like you just take

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:18.760
the SATs from the node and then you just buy the gas card and then you use the gas card

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:19.760
at the gas pump.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:20.760
That's not so bad.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:26.560
And then you just have access to it like a bank account essentially, which is kind of

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:27.560
a neat idea.

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:30.560
And I mean, I suppose there's other things that you could turn tricks, you know?

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.560
You could do things like that.

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.560
Oh gosh.

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:39.880
We'll just further enable what you're already doing with the new way of monetizing.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:45.520
I mean, I think now the new betting pool is not when is Brent going to leave Alex's.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.440
Is Brent going to make it home and get enough time at home to make it down here?

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.440
And it's okay if you don't.

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:51.440
It's all right.

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:52.440
I won't be mad.

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.320
But I think that's the new bet is will he make it for the road trip?

01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:58.840
Will he stay at Alex's and he gets home and then he doesn't, you know, something might

01:07:58.840 --> 01:07:59.840
happen.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:00.840
We're getting into that window now.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:01.840
Oh yeah.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:02.840
I see what you're saying.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:06.200
My understanding is he does have some cats that probably want some time with him.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:07.200
Right.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:10.600
Or he decorated and they probably got a new roommate already.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:15.420
So I think we could I think we could get odds going on if Brent makes it for the road trip.

01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:17.920
You know, I mean, I don't want it to not happen.

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:23.000
But if it makes it I'd like to monetize it is like rather than meeting you on route somewhere.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.880
He's here for like the leaving from the studio area.

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:26.880
Yeah.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:27.880
Yeah.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:28.880
Yeah.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.880
Yeah.

01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:30.880
Yeah.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:32.040
See, I don't even consider that a possibility of not happening.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.040
No.

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.040
All right.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.040
That's like a 100 percent.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.040
The biggest question for me is taking up your bet.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.040
All right.

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040
So this is what I'm thinking.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.520
This makes these this is odds that are worth that.

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.520
All right.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.520
All right.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:50.280
But I think maybe a second question is, will I make it back home before that trip or will

01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:51.280
I just go straight from?

01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.280
Oh, sure.

01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.280
Yeah.

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:54.280
That's a possibility as well.

01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:55.280
Hmm.

01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.280
Yeah, there's that's true.

01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:00.080
I don't know how much time you've got left on your America allowance punch card.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.280
It's a I get a I got a free six months.

01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.280
I think I'm into month.

01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:05.400
How long have I been here?

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:07.400
I don't know.

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.400
Three months.

01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:09.400
I don't know.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.400
No, it's been what?

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.400
Two months.

01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.160
I think it's like six weeks.

01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.160
I don't remember.

01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:15.160
So after this.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.160
Right.

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:18.880
And so I think I have time left.

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:23.280
The real question is, how long will you want me to stay at the studio either before or

01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:24.280
after?

01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:25.280
Oh, right.

01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.640
Because if we're clever, we have after time to like edit what we get to work on some projects.

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:30.640
Yeah, that's true.

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:31.640
Yeah.

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.640
Mm hmm.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.360
Well, you know, I mean, plus Wes and I have to go for Thai food.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:36.360
We do.

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.360
Yeah, that's true.

01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:41.880
So we just got to make sure we don't get you in trouble with, you know, your punch card.

01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:45.480
But yeah, this I just feel like there's a lot of odds we could bet here on.

01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:46.480
I don't know.

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:47.480
There's opportunity.

01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:49.920
Maybe, you know, maybe we just take some on.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:50.920
Yeah.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.920
Do some gambling.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:52.920
Best case.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:53.920
We see Brent.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:54.920
I like it.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.160
I'm not saying I want to turn into a degenerate gambler, but.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:12.760
Turn into.
