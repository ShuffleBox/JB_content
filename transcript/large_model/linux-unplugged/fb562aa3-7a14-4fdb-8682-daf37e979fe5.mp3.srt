1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Let's start with a nice positive story, a nice positive note.

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,480
I noticed the Linux Foundation posted this up over at Linux.com about an 84-year-old

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,380
volunteer who's never worked in IT, but he spends his free time rebuilding laptops, loading

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,340
them with different versions of Linux, and then shipping them off to different areas

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,880
in Africa.

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,540
It's with an initiative called Free Geek, and the Linux Foundation made a video of it,

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,540
so let's watch it.

8
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,280
I think this is pretty cool.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,400
I'm James Anderson.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,920
I'm 84 years old.

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,320
Through the years, I've always done repair work.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,680
I've enjoyed just taking things apart and seeing how they work, but that goes way back

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:50,000
to childhood when I took apart an electric plug in my grandmother's floor lamp and promptly

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,280
blew out all the fuses.

15
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,280
I'd had a computer since the days of what we called then transportable computers, a

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,880
luggable computer, weighed as much as my wife's sewing machine that I carried around, so I've

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:11,120
had owned a computer since probably the mid-1980s, and I've always been interested, used them,

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:19,500
although I'd never been an IT person at all, never had any training in it.

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,200
I work at Free Geek.

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,080
I learned about Free Geek from my friend Bob, who was a neighbor.

21
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,860
I had just returned from working for 13 weeks in Zimbabwe.

22
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,960
I saw the need for computers among young people who were studying and who seemed deprived

23
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,140
to me of the opportunities that computers offered them, so when I heard about Free Geek

24
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:50,080
and its program of receiving donations of used computers and the possibility that through

25
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:57,640
rebuilding them, I might be able to provide computers to some of those young people.

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,280
After a couple of years here, I moved into rebuilding laptops, and since I've been

27
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:08,480
rebuilding laptops, we've sent well over 100 laptops to various African nations and

28
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,000
to be used in schools and by nonprofit organizations.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,240
Free Geek makes a huge point of being open source, so every PC computer here goes out

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,040
with Linux-based, and that's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.

31
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,040
This is just one room with our laptops waiting to be repaired.

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,880
All of these that are working will go out with Linux-based operating systems.

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,800
My continuing goal in being at Free Geek is to provide the laptops for Africa, and the

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,120
kind of problem-solving that's involved.

35
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:52,840
You've run into an issue with a computer, and I find it very rewarding to solve that

36
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,840
problem.

37
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,440
I like the tinkering, but above all, I just simply enjoy the community.

38
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,120
It's an unusual place, and the results are very rewarding.

39
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,760
So as long as I'm able, I think I will be here on Fridays, as long as they'll let me

40
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,440
and I have no indication that they won't.

41
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
That's pretty neat.

42
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,320
You know, what I want to do is I'd like to go find those places and talk to those people.

43
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,320
That's pretty neat.

44
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,480
I don't know if they do those around here, but I think there might be something like

45
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,480
that.

46
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,440
I want to do that as a job.

47
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
I know.

48
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,160
It's pretty cool to take those old machines that people don't want to necessarily use

49
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,080
and send them somewhere, make them be of pretty good use.

50
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,600
So that is pretty cool.

51
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,960
Anderson began in 2006, that's pretty cool, after he and his wife went to Zimbabwe to

52
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
teach math.

53
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,560
They didn't know to do an interview at scale with an organization in Southern California

54
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,560
that was doing something like that?

55
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,560
Yeah, there's a few.

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,800
We see them at every fest we go to.

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,600
Yeah, it's getting more and more of a thing, which is like, oh, I just don't know how to

58
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,600
get involved.

59
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,960
I don't know much about it, but I know that there's a local group here that takes old

60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,560
computers and puts them at libraries or something.

61
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,960
They're not sending them off out of the country, they're putting them here local for students

62
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,960
and stuff.

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
So it's pretty neat.

64
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:14,640
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's just simply counting down

65
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,280
the days until they install Linux on the Apple Watch.

66
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,520
My name is Chris.

67
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
And my name is Matt.

68
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,120
All right, Matt, that'll conclude all of our Apple Watch discussion, probably forever in

69
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
Linux Unplugged.

70
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
No, I can't say that.

71
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,480
But definitely this week, we have a huge show for episode 91.

72
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,040
We got a couple of things to follow up on that I think are pretty important because

73
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,800
we pre-recorded last week, so I want to get those in towards the top.

74
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,540
Then Mr. Saigo, friend of the show, joins us in just a little bit to discuss what's

75
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,680
going on at Colab and the Roundcube project, which is...

76
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,600
Roundcube is an incredible open source web mail project.

77
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,240
I just recently backed their most recent crowdfunding initiative.

78
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,460
We're going to talk about that, maybe discuss how it compares to some of the other popular

79
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,460
projects out there.

80
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,560
So Saigo will be joining us to talk about all that.

81
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,040
And then towards the end of the show, we're going to get the Mumble Room's reaction to

82
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,600
the Ubuntu 15.04 release.

83
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,500
There has been some strong reaction in some areas of the internet, specifically in regards

84
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,240
to the system de-implementation.

85
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
I don't look into that in just a minute.

86
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,120
And then we're going to look ahead at Ubuntu 15.10 just got its name.

87
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,160
They just announced a new focus on the desktop.

88
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,800
We'll try to figure out what the hell that means and if it actually is going to make

89
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,440
any bit of difference.

90
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,380
So we got a lot to talk about today, a lot to get through.

91
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,080
And not only that, we have a bustin' Mumble Room.

92
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
Let's bring them in right now.

93
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Time appropriate greetings, my virtual lug.

94
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Time appropriate greetings.

95
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Hello.

96
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,080
Good evening.

97
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,080
Hello, everybody.

98
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Hello.

99
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Hi, guys.

100
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
Oh, Wimpy and Popy.

101
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
You guys snuck in right as we got started.

102
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Hello, guys.

103
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
Good to have you here, too.

104
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,280
Time to do, let's do a victory lap for a member in our audience.

105
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:54,880
This just came in just about five hours ago from PM Nocturnal, his freshly minted MacBook

106
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,200
Pro 8.1 edition.

107
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,760
It looks pretty nice, and he had this to write in.

108
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,080
I just thought this was perfect because we've been following this kind of thread for three

109
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
weeks now.

110
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,420
He says, I just converted my family over to Linux completely.

111
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,820
The last was a MacBook Pro used by my bro.

112
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:13,420
The moment it was updated to Yosemite, things started to slow down horribly.

113
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,680
It took 30 effing seconds to start Firefox on it.

114
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,520
He was fed up, and it went, and in one night, I installed Linux Mint 17.1 Cinnamon Edition,

115
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,320
and he said, quietly kept.

116
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,480
I'm not sure, I guess he just quietly kept it on there.

117
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,640
He was so happy to see the way I customized it to work with his workflow.

118
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,720
He now owns a small photographic and AV studio.

119
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,320
Now all I need is quality audio and video editing apps.

120
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,520
He's willing to learn new apps.

121
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,880
GIMP is what I made him use in Mac, so editing wasn't a problem under Linux.

122
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,420
iMovie and GarageBand is what's stopping me to make the complete switch for him.

123
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,640
He started using KDE and Live, and he started to like it, yet there's not much like iMovie.

124
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,400
I hope he'll eventually switch over for audio, but I can't think of a good app.

125
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,640
I'm searching things like KX Studio, AV Linux, but suggestions are welcome.

126
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,680
He says also, we'll get to suggestions in just a second, but he says also, just a tip,

127
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,640
if you're converting a Windows user to Linux, just hit them with quality plasma-based desktop.

128
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,440
Manjaro is good, yeah, he likes Manjaro.

129
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,600
For Mac users, go with Linux Mint Cinnamon rather than Gnome and install Plank and customize

130
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
it.

131
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
That's worked for him.

132
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,600
Well, that's each your own.

133
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,240
So, audio apps, I'm a big fan of Oaken Audio and Audacity, which Audacity just recently

134
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,560
had, I read an interview with the developers, there's some really interesting stuff happening

135
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
with the project there.

136
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:31,240
They are finally working on a new UI for Audacity, which would be really welcome, and it seems

137
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,960
to be like it's got some serious legs.

138
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,220
They just recently did an update after a long time that introduced real-time effects preview,

139
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,040
so Audacity is getting pretty serious.

140
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,040
The UI, I think, is doing it a disservice because it doesn't look like a serious app.

141
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:48,120
It looks like a 90s Linux app that was always missing features compared to the proprietary

142
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,840
alternatives, where now it's actually a pretty serious contender.

143
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,120
It just has that legacy UI.

144
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,760
So take a look at that, PC or PM Nocturnal, but Matt, do you have any suggestions for

145
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,760
audio stuff?

146
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,440
You know, I've been using Audacity since as long, literally as far back as I can remember,

147
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,780
since my earliest days of using Linux, and yeah, the UI is definitely one of those things

148
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,800
to where it grows on you after a while.

149
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,320
Initially I thought it was, even back then I thought it was horribly ugly, but now it's

150
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,880
like I can't even fathom them changing that.

151
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,960
It would feel somehow wrong, but as far as other applications, that's pretty much my

152
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
primary one.

153
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,040
I can't really see using anything else.

154
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,400
It just does what I need it to, but my needs are pretty minimal.

155
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:35,280
Mumbaroon, anybody have any comments on audio and things like for studio work?

156
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,760
Nobody's going to mention Ardour, really?

157
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,560
I figured somebody would come to the defense of Ardour.

158
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,740
Yeah, this is your more serious end production software, where if you have multiple tracks

159
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,840
and devices coming in real-time audio recording, with real-time effects and all of that, Ardour

160
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,600
is serious business, and it's definitely worth taking a look at too.

161
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,320
I think we've mentioned this before, but I don't mention it very often because we don't

162
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,320
use it here at JV1, so I don't have a lot of hands-on experience with it.

163
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,720
I think if I did, I'd probably promote it more.

164
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,240
I think my hangup is, because I've looked at wanting to get into it at one point, but

165
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,200
I think when I look at it, I see all these options, and I'm a little overwhelmed, but

166
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,800
at the same time, I want to take a weekend and just dedicate myself to trying to learn,

167
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,400
because I'm sure I can, but I feel like it's like trying to learn Blender.

168
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,240
Incredibly powerful, but I'm just too much of a noob, I guess.

169
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,000
Lightworks is like that too, and that's a really hard line to walk if you're going to

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,480
have a serious tool to do production and work.

171
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,340
They are often too complicated in a lot of ways.

172
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,760
It's just the nature of the beast.

173
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,520
I don't know if you guys noticed, but today, it doesn't really affect us Linux users yet,

174
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,880
but good old games, the guys over at GOG, guys and gals, I shouldn't say guys, the folks,

175
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,780
the people, launched Galaxy to the public today.

176
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:56,060
It's only available for Windows and Mac, but I suppose eventually they seem to be indicating

177
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,200
that they'll be also releasing for Linux.

178
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,820
What is Galaxy?

179
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,680
I didn't know until this morning, to be honest, because it's not really on my radar, but think

180
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,960
of it as a platform for DRM-free games similar to Steam, with auto-updates, downloading from

181
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:14,360
the library, social interaction, and one of the key components is it does not require

182
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
online connection.

183
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:24,160
Now, it is not open source, but it is predominantly featured focusing on DRM-free games.

184
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,720
Anybody in the Mumble Room see this and have a reaction to it?

185
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,960
We talked about it today on Tech Talk Today, and it seems to be that the people who are

186
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,560
for this are people that like Steam, but have a good set of games they have from their good

187
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,160
old games library, don't really want to have to have online play, want to still be able

188
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,080
to do like the social thing for multiplayer and things like that.

189
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,240
Well, I'm on their page now, I'm looking at, just under the news section for GOG, just

190
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,280
kind of get an idea of it.

191
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
Sounds really awesome.

192
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,740
Unfortunately, their news page for it is really doing it a disservice because all it shows

193
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,280
me is a banner with GOG.com Galaxy and some space and then the verbiage.

194
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,680
I would really be interested in maybe, I don't know, seeing the beta in action on a YouTube

195
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
video.

196
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,560
So they want to be, think Steam, but for GOG games, but they're going to do a couple of

197
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,860
features like rollbacks, like if a game update makes something you don't like, you can roll

198
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,600
back to the previous version.

199
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
That's kind of neat.

200
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
I like that.

201
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
No, I love that.

202
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
Right?

203
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,080
In fact, you don't even have to have a profile to use it unless you want to get game achievements

204
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,360
and things like that.

205
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,360
So it sounds like the two killer features then, if I'm understanding correctly, the

206
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,280
big one is if you just really don't want to deal with the profile, you don't have to have

207
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,680
one if you don't want to have the achievements and whatnot.

208
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,400
And then the rollback feature, that alone, honestly, I got to tell you, that's pretty

209
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
sweet.

210
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Yeah.

211
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
It's cool.

212
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
WWNSX, what do you think?

213
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:49,520
I'm like, with the Steam backlash, a week and a half ago or so, there was someone made

214
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:55,320
an app or someone's been working on an app or it conglomerates like this.

215
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,320
It was going to make this Steam and then Origin all at once.

216
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,480
It's just too much to run on one system.

217
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,440
Like I have Steam or I have Origin, then I have to have this.

218
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,600
And then on top of that, on Steam, if you buy something from Ubisoft, then you have

219
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,840
Uplay running at the same time as Steam.

220
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:22,680
It's a good idea if you want to focus solely on GOG, DRM free, hopefully want to get more

221
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
Linux titles.

222
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,440
But to me, it's just like, I already have enough.

223
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,760
I'll probably maybe get it.

224
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,960
I do like some of the things like they're pushing the optional auto updates that you

225
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,360
can roll back.

226
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
That's really good.

227
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
Yeah.

228
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
I guess I'm starting to...

229
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,240
I was starting to lean towards it.

230
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,360
Well, I watched their video and their video is very much like consumer choice and freedom

231
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
of this.

232
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
And here, let me...

233
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
I'll just...

234
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,320
Let me check that it gets towards the end of the video, about 50 seconds into the video.

235
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
...to use.

236
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,480
We call this freedom of choice.

237
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,800
Our client application will offer convenient game updating as well as the option to stay

238
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,880
in touch with friends, but we will never force it on you, never require you to have it to

239
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,400
play your games.

240
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,840
We call it the optional client.

241
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,200
Regardless of which digital store you buy your games from, we don't think you should

242
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,360
be locked into it.

243
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,440
We strongly believe that you should be free to play together with all your friends without

244
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,640
any third party client apps or accounts required.

245
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,120
We call this Classplay.

246
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:37,520
Welcome to GOG Galaxy, the DRM free online gaming platform.

247
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,400
So that's how they pitch it.

248
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Pretty good pitch.

249
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
That's actually...

250
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
Okay, now that's pretty good.

251
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Yeah, right?

252
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Immediately I realized why I care.

253
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Yeah.

254
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,400
That's always been my big gripe with anything.

255
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
I like that.

256
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
And I like that it's optional.

257
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:52,040
But the only way I could see this possibly working is if I only have Steam in this.

258
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
There's no way I want more than that.

259
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,360
I don't want Steam, Desura, and whatever the else is.

260
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,900
And thankfully on Linux, we don't have this whole crap show, but yeah.

261
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,600
Although it is kind of funny to where we get rid of that pesky DRM stuff so that you can

262
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,320
run this on your Windows computer kind of mentality, which is kind of like, what?

263
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,720
But outside of that, I like the message.

264
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,720
I like the idea.

265
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,080
I like the fact that they are at least at some general level providing folks with a

266
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,080
choice, and that's cool.

267
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,440
And I'm going to grab a video that Michael89 in the chat room just linked here.

268
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,920
This is the first look from Kelly Head Pro, or Craig Head Pro.

269
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
I'm sorry, Craig Head.

270
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
I don't...

271
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Hey, I'm Craig of Craig Head Pro.

272
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,920
That's Craig.

273
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,920
There you go.

274
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,920
Nice.

275
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,920
It looks like he's on Windows 10.

276
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,920
So, yeah.

277
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Of course.

278
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
Moving on.

279
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,000
I would say it looks like a web app on a desktop, so it looks like your GOG library.

280
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,120
The fact that they couldn't make this available for Linux is a joke.

281
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
Yeah.

282
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
That's kind of my...

283
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Wow.

284
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,600
It's like pushing the whole DRM free freedom choice, you know, come on.

285
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,600
You got to go all the way with it.

286
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,600
That's all.

287
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
This is their Galaxy client.

288
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
This is their website.

289
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Oh, that's it.

290
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
This is...

291
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,680
You're telling me they couldn't have released this for Linux?

292
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
This is super weak.

293
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,200
It's not like it's really that visually...

294
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Like it doesn't...

295
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,200
It looks like it's just a website.

296
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,880
It looks like a Chromium app with a web page inside of it.

297
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
It probably is.

298
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,000
You know what would be funny is to actually build that and then email it to them.

299
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,720
This is starting to feel like good old games or GOGs.

300
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,120
I like them a lot, but they're lackluster.

301
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,920
Like if you want to be a serious contender in this game, you got to be like Steamin'

302
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,920
Dessert.

303
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,920
You got to have a Linux client.

304
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
A, number one.

305
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,960
B, make the client seriously worth it.

306
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,340
Don't do this crap MVP stuff.

307
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,120
Actually show something that's worth my time.

308
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
I just...

309
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,200
Well, visually, it's meh, you know, at best.

310
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,280
I mean, there's that factor.

311
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,080
But also, as you pointed out, the fact that they're not releasing it for Linux.

312
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,200
I mean, just from a brass tax financial point of view, fun fact, if you're in the indie

313
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:48,080
game space or you're in the not EA or not, you know, some of the bigger guys out there

314
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,400
that are running games on disks and things like that you buy from stores, you probably

315
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,520
want to make sure you're hitting as many markets as possible and Linux is where the growth

316
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
is.

317
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,520
So they might want to get on that.

318
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,440
And, you know, you talk to indie developers and they say Linux is a small but passionate

319
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,000
and growing section of their business and they want to be in there now as they're growing

320
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
their business.

321
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,160
It makes a lot of sense for them.

322
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,760
I'm sure GOG will eventually come around with a Linux client, but after seeing that, I'm

323
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,520
not so sure I'm waiting anymore.

324
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,120
I'll just continue to download from their website.

325
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,800
I just bought one of the Star Wars games a couple of days ago from them.

326
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,240
Well, as you pointed out, if anyone wants to build their own, they can.

327
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,000
They just simply, you know, I forget exactly how you do it from Chrome, but it's usually

328
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
pretty easy.

329
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,600
You just like pop out a thing and it appears on your desktop.

330
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
There you go.

331
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
You're done.

332
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
You know what?

333
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
I'm going to build them.

334
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,640
I'm going to create it for them and then I'm going to send it to them.

335
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
I'm going to send them a little voice.

336
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:36,760
And be like, call it the Linux port of the GOG galaxy.

337
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
Seriously?

338
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
Yeah.

339
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,760
Okay.

340
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,760
Are we being too harsh?

341
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,760
Yeah.

342
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:49,720
I think it's interesting because GOG still has a user base which is 90% Windows and Mac

343
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,000
and they are going to get a Linux client available.

344
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,040
I think they're meeting a need that Linux games is a process of refinement.

345
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:08,480
Steam gets the massive user base over, but it still contains DRM, which isn't what everyone

346
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,280
should be content with.

347
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,840
I think I don't know if GOG is going to be the people who make it.

348
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:24,640
They make what everyone wants, but as long as there's people trying to work on it, can't

349
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,160
we only just make progress?

350
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Yeah.

351
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,320
I do kind of grok what you're saying, but I kind of hate that argument on the other

352
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:40,000
respect because I would say GOG's small Linux share would be due to the fact that they've

353
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,200
completely ignored GOG, even teased a Linux market to some degree pre-Mac announcement

354
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,400
for many years.

355
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,640
And so it's kind of like saying, my tomato garden really sucks.

356
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
Yeah.

357
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
Yeah.

358
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Guess what?

359
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
I don't nurture my tomato garden.

360
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
Yeah.

361
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Obviously it sucks.

362
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
I mean, that's obvious.

363
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,160
Yes, of course their Linux market share is tiny.

364
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,280
There was demand for them to enter this market well before there was ever Steam for Linux.

365
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,580
I understand that just sheer numbers wise, the Linux share is small, but they could have

366
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,840
been with their DRM free stance, with their huge DOSBox compatibility.

367
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:22,960
And here's the other thing, before you completely give them a pass, also consider that in this

368
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,120
same time while Steam passed them up and got a Linux client out there, there's this other

369
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,440
group that came along called the Humble Bundle.

370
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,760
And the Humble Bundle not only showed us how you can get games over to Linux, but how you

371
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,600
can actually get developers to do ports, and in almost all cases native ports over to Linux.

372
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,160
And that's another opportunity that GOG completely missed.

373
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,820
They got lapped by the Humble guys.

374
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,480
Now there's a full-time Humble store, and they're making great profits.

375
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,080
And GOG totally missed that opportunity, because they never had their head in Linux.

376
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,420
They never figured it out.

377
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,040
But if they would have followed some of these things, they could have been these guys, GOG

378
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,200
would have been perfect for those kind of bundles.

379
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,680
That would have been perfect for them.

380
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,160
Plus, they could have filled in from their back catalog as well.

381
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
They didn't see it.

382
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,920
And I'm sure they don't have the resources, but I don't want to give them too much of

383
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
a pass.

384
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:13,120
We too often do that, and in reality, sometimes companies make mistakes and they miss market

385
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
opportunities.

386
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,800
And I think GOG's done that, and now they're at a continual disadvantage in the Linux market,

387
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,840
and so it continues to perpetuate that priority for them.

388
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,220
One area I think they still have an opportunity to recoup from, because I do agree that they

389
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,240
missed an opportunity, but I see another one.

390
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,000
What they're doing with this client itself is great.

391
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I love that.

392
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,260
Unfortunately, it's not available for us.

393
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,240
If they would simply pull the trigger and export an icon to their desktop, like I suggested

394
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,040
with Chrome, and make it available to everybody, I honestly feel like that it's like, OK, so

395
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
we've created an atmosphere.

396
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,000
Now, they may not have the resources to encourage a lot of porting to games.

397
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,240
They may not even have an interest in it, but at least the client is there.

398
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,900
At least it's like, OK, now we're different than Steam.

399
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,560
Come bring your games over to us, and we can actually encourage this other atmosphere.

400
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,000
Just having something on the desktop is nice.

401
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,320
Just that is nice.

402
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,680
And then other game developers might be like, oh, hey, I would like to have an opportunity

403
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,240
to provide my games to where they don't have to have an account.

404
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
This is different than Steam.

405
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
That's cool.

406
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Let's check that out.

407
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
That's all they've got to do.

408
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
It doesn't require a lot of effort on their part.

409
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,360
It doesn't take a lot.

410
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,240
It doesn't have to be much.

411
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,720
It just has to be slightly more useful than the web.

412
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,000
That's all you have to go for.

413
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,920
Steam walks that line pretty closely.

414
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,840
Steam is, in a lot of ways, it's the insides of the Steam Chrome are just a web page.

415
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,140
The outsides, though, are written in the native platform.

416
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,840
So like in the case of Linux, it's GTK, and you can theme it.

417
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,860
And you can go in there and set the dialogs and create libraries and where you want downloads

418
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,860
to go.

419
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,200
You can opt into betas and the settings.

420
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,560
There's interfaces for your microphone, for doing team speak, and for your social settings.

421
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,520
All perfect, all in the Steam client, without ever having to load your web page.

422
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,080
So the Steam client does a brilliant job of walking the line, of standing on top of their

423
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,040
web technology, so that way they don't have to write two different stores at the same

424
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
time.

425
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,520
But then yet wrapping it in a Chrome that gives you a lot of extra options and benefits

426
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,880
that absolutely make it worth having the Steam client, not to mention the downloader management

427
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,120
and all that kind of stuff.

428
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:13,640
So I think that's all GOG really has to do, and that bar is not that high.

429
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Steam's not that great.

430
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,960
No, it really isn't.

431
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,440
And as much as I enjoy Steam games, I would be thrilled pink to see GOG rattle Valve's

432
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Cage a little bit.

433
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
Great!

434
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
I'm all for that.

435
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
Yeah.

436
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
Cool.

437
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,880
But it has to have some kind of functionality, and I'm sure they'll work that in there.

438
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,880
Oh yeah.

439
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,320
And like I said, I have not written them off at all.

440
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,280
Hopefully this is their cold cup of coffee, and that they're going to say, oh wait, we

441
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,280
really need to get on this.

442
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,160
As soon as one hits the AUR, I'm going to install it.

443
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
There you go.

444
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,760
Which will be five minutes from now.

445
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
You think?

446
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,760
Yeah.

447
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,760
I wonder.

448
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Wouldn't be that hard.

449
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,760
Yeah.

450
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,760
All right.

451
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,560
So before we go any further, I want to take a minute and talk about our friends over at

452
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,600
Linux Academy who are sponsoring this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

453
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,360
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, speaking of that.

454
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,120
And that's where you're going to get our Linux Unplugged discount, which is fantastic.

455
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:11,840
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and you'll get a 33% discount on the Linux Academy

456
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,840
content.

457
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
That's an incredible discount.

458
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
33% is nuts.

459
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,000
So that's going to be $50 for a quarter.

460
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,800
Now, why do they do it like this?

461
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,240
Why is this system set up like this?

462
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,160
Because they're always adding great stuff, really, really, really great stuff.

463
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,800
I could tell you all about Linux Academy, and I want to do that.

464
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,960
But a lot of you have heard about Linux Academy.

465
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,880
So for those of you who have heard this spot before, stay tuned, because there's something

466
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,320
that is for you specifically that I want to get to.

467
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,200
But first, for those of you who are new, Linux Academy is the place to go to make yourself

468
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,400
sort of break through that level, to train yourself on that next skill set, to learn

469
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,040
that next thing, to transition from one distribution to another.

470
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,500
It's an online, self-paced learning system.

471
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,360
It's an entire platform created by true Linux and open source enthusiasts who got together

472
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,720
with their friends who are educators and developers, and they created the Linux Academy platform

473
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,380
specifically for this purpose.

474
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,960
That's all they do is cover open source and Linux technologies.

475
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,400
That's why they're great at it.

476
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
It's their passion.

477
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,400
It's their focus.

478
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,040
And they have scenario-based labs, which give me the confidence, and will give you the confidence,

479
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,980
because you work hands-on in these scenarios.

480
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,560
They'll receive access to these labs.

481
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,520
They'll put you in the middle of tasks common to an everyday environment.

482
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,360
You'll work in the advanced lab environments and complete the scenarios from beginning

483
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,720
to end on live servers.

484
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,100
So you'll walk away from that having the experience and confidence when you need to go apply that

485
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,220
to a job.

486
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,080
That's more than just training.

487
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,200
That honestly, for me, reduces anxiety.

488
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,840
That means I'm not doing this stuff for the first time.

489
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,720
Plus, you don't have to worry if you get a little stuck.

490
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,240
There's instructor help available.

491
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,600
You can choose from seven-plus Linux distributions.

492
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,100
They'll automatically adjust the courseware and the virtual machines, because they spin

493
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,840
up virtual machines as you need them.

494
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,120
And this can be a good cost savings if you're going to be learning some AWS stuff, because

495
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,440
you don't have to worry about getting dinged on AWS, which I've done.

496
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,320
And something for guys like me who've now been a member for Linux Academy for a little

497
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,440
while, they've added nuggets.

498
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,640
And I like this because I have found that even though I've been using Linux for longer

499
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,220
than I'd like to admit, I still could do things a little bit better from time to time.

500
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,720
And there's just a lot of ways to string things together.

501
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,440
And this is where nuggets come together.

502
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,680
They're single how-tos that walk you through doing specific tasks that don't belong on

503
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,280
a course, don't really go with like a large range of things.

504
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,960
It's a single video lesson.

505
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,040
It's somewhere between two and 60 minutes, and it teaches you like one specific thing

506
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
on how to do it.

507
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
It's pretty cool.

508
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,320
And those are nuggets, and they just added them recently.

509
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,440
So speaking of things they've added recently, if you've been a listener for a little while,

510
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,240
you're probably familiar with Linux Academy.

511
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,440
You might even be a member, at least I hope you are.

512
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,360
Well, I think this is something pretty cool, and it's going to fund open source development.

513
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,640
So I want to tell you about it.

514
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,240
It's called the Linux Academy Founders Club, and this is where you can go.

515
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,680
You can become a member.

516
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,120
You get access to like content as it's being developed.

517
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,440
You get major swag from time to time, access to site beta features.

518
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,320
You get special recognition in the community, different areas.

519
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,280
But you also get to vote on something really neat that they're working on.

520
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,820
It's their open source grant program.

521
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,920
Any open source license project can apply for this, and they're going to give up to

522
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,040
$5,000 for the project that their Founders Club votes on.

523
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,920
That's amazing, because these guys truly care about this kind of stuff, and they want to

524
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,920
give it back.

525
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,440
And there's a pretty good chance that one of those open source projects is going to

526
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,440
be in our audience.

527
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,720
So I'm going to have more information about how you can get that soon.

528
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,320
The RHCSA just also recently went live.

529
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,080
DevOps Essentials is available now.

530
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,260
50 Video Nuggets just recently went up.

531
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,640
The OpenStack course is just, they're always updating new stuff.

532
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,760
I think that's probably the area I should maybe visit, to be honest with you.

533
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,720
But I love that I know it's just always constantly getting refreshed, and so that means I'm always

534
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,800
getting value out of my membership, which I do pay for my membership.

535
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,680
You go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, sign up, get our 33% discount, and you also

536
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,680
support this show.

537
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,960
And then you get to try something out really great that might even help take your skills

538
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,960
set up to the next level.

539
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,720
They have in-depth resources.

540
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,920
You're going to be super impressed.

541
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,880
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

542
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,840
And a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

543
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,480
Well, two critical courses that I don't think most people are aware of, that I think are

544
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,880
probably two of the most important.

545
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,600
The first one is, I've never touched Linux in a day in my life, and where do I get started?

546
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
That's a good one.

547
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
I love that course.

548
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,760
I mean, I forget the proper name for it, but that's essentially what it is.

549
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,560
It's like, it is literally, you park anyone in front of it, and they will actually walk

550
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
them through it.

551
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:22,040
And the second course is, okay, so I've got some certs, I've studied for my certs, I'm

552
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
ready to go.

553
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,640
It's basically designed to help you find work.

554
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
Yes.

555
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,640
That's awesome.

556
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,280
That's an actual proper course they have.

557
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,400
Those two get you in the door and it gets you out the door.

558
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,720
You know what makes me pumped to do these spots is when I get there, and I'd love people

559
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,120
to keep sending them to me, when they say, hey, I went Linux Academy, I got my certs,

560
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
I got a job.

561
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
Right?

562
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,120
Yeah.

563
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
That's really cool.

564
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
So cool.

565
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,320
So we have Mr. Saigo joining us in just a moment, but producer Rotten Corps is here,

566
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:50,520
and I wanted to get an update on a software project that he's involved with.

567
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:56,240
So I asked him to join us to give us a little update on YouGet, which just shipped version

568
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
2.0.

569
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,120
Mr. Corps, what's new with YouGet, and what the heck is YouGet?

570
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,720
YouGet is a download manager.

571
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,600
It's a multi-download, so you can do a queue of downloads, you can get a ton of downloads

572
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,300
all at once, and it makes it a lot easier to just manage a large list of downloads that

573
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,300
you're doing.

574
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,560
And this is a project you maintain?

575
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Yeah.

576
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,640
I'm one of the... I'm not the founder, but I'm the project manager of the project.

577
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,520
And we've actually made a lot of changes.

578
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:34,400
There's a couple thousand line changes, and there's been almost a couple hundred... I

579
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,360
think it's like 180, 175, somewhere around there, commits to it over the course of about

580
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,600
a year or so.

581
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:50,100
The biggest change is the fact that we've separated the UI and the application core,

582
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:57,080
so that the whole core is separate from the GTK toolkit, so that allows us... we could

583
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:00,400
eventually put QT on it or something like that.

584
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,160
We haven't set that up, but the whole goal is to be able to do that at some point.

585
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:12,760
We've also made it where... it used to be with the 1.0 branch, there was a requirement

586
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:19,160
for the plugin to do certain features, like multi-threading and mirrors, so multi-source

587
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
modes.

588
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:24,840
We no longer require that plugin, although we still offer the plugin, and we even improved

589
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,800
some features with the plugin as well.

590
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:34,320
So now there's the core engine, which is run through curl, and area two as the plugin are

591
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,560
now separated both as plugins, so you can choose whichever one you want.

592
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,840
You can even... if one of them fails, you can actually make it revert to the next one

593
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,000
in a sequence, so no matter what, the engines will be there to do whatever you want to do.

594
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,840
And what's the shenanigans I hear about an Android app?

595
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,840
What's this crap?

596
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
What is this?

597
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,840
Yeah, we created an Android app for YouGet.

598
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:00,440
It's actually not based on the 2.0 version, but it is basically all the features that

599
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,240
people love about YouGet is in the Android version as well.

600
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,840
That is super cool.

601
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,800
And you can use it to download crap to your Android device, like your SD card or whatever?

602
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,080
Yeah, you can download anything you want.

603
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:19,600
One of my favorite parts is that with my RSS reader, I can just copy the URL and have YouGet

604
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,280
running and then it'll immediately start downloading to the app.

605
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,280
That's neat.

606
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
That's great.

607
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
Well, very cool.

608
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,520
I love it because when I'm going to download a big ISO or a whole bunch of stuff or a big

609
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,400
batch of stuff off of archive.org, I often will just throw it into YouGet.

610
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,360
That way I can just close my browser and not worry about it.

611
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,360
I like it.

612
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,920
There's actually a new feature we added as well that helps people who want to do a huge

613
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,040
batch.

614
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,880
We have a system called Sequential Batch where it'll automatically scan the list of what

615
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:53,040
you want it to do and it will use wildcards to find out what, like to just go through

616
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:57,520
a sequence of the numbers based on dates or something like that.

617
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,680
Now we actually have it where you can do multiple wildcards in the same list.

618
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,920
That sounds like somebody could nicely abuse a CDN with that one.

619
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Very nice, sir.

620
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,920
Very nice.

621
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
The CDN punisher.

622
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,800
You should, you know, if you did it right, you could repackage this and sell it to guys

623
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,640
like Alan as a CDN stress tester.

624
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,640
All right.

625
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,560
All right, Rob Korfst, thank you, sir, for the update and it was great to see you at

626
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,560
Linux Fest.

627
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,400
We'll have a link to YouGet in the show notes.

628
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
All right.

629
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:31,040
So we'll have, we have just speaking of Linux Fest Northwest, I also wanted to mention Jupiter

630
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Broadcasting is going to be at OSCON in July, July 20th through the 24th.

631
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,280
See Noah and I at OSCON as well as Angela and Paige.

632
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,760
And I don't know, maybe some others as well.

633
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,640
We'll probably be taking the train down or perhaps maybe taking the whole family down.

634
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,920
So OSCON is the O'Reilly Open Source Conference.

635
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,200
I think this is the last year it's going to be in Portland too.

636
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,080
So this may be the last year I go.

637
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,160
So if you want to meet up with us, join us July 20th and the 24th.

638
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:02,880
If that's not going to work for you, also coming up even sooner, Southeast Linux Fest,

639
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,520
June 12th through the 14th at the Sheraton Charlotte Airport in Charlotte, North Carolina,

640
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,840
June 12th through the 14th, Southeast Linux Fest.

641
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,200
I'm not so sure if I'll be at this one or BSDCAN because they both are on the same day

642
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,720
or weekend, but I'm pretty sure Noah and producer Q5SIS will be at Southeast Linux Fest and

643
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,720
we'll have a big presence.

644
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,560
They're a live stream powered by OBS and we'd love to have you stop by and say hi to us.

645
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,480
That is a great, great, one of the best Linux Fest.

646
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,480
Not the best.

647
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
I can't, I mean, come on guys.

648
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,300
Linux Fest Northwest in my backyard.

649
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:38,360
But if I live down South, something tells me this might be the one.

650
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,560
Southeast Linux Fest or SELF, June 12th through the 14th, come say hi to the JB crew.

651
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:48,860
And speaking of SELF, our buddies over at the Arch Assault Project have a shirt to help

652
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,720
fund their initiative to get to SELF to meet the community.

653
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,880
They're releasing their first Arch Assault shirt in prep for Southeast Linux Fest.

654
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:03,640
They are selling them at teespring.com slash archassault dash at dash SELF.

655
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:08,160
Not the best URL ever, but it's a teespring.com slash archassault dash at dash SELF.

656
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,560
If you like the Arch Assault Project and want to help them get to SELF, they'd love to sell

657
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:16,320
a few shirts and I'll have a link in the show note for that as well.

658
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,320
And it's a nice shirt.

659
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,160
It's got the Arch Assault logo right here on the front.

660
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,560
Oh, that's cool.

661
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Yeah.

662
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,560
And I'm an Arch fan, of course.

663
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
Everybody knows that.

664
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,720
And I used to be a pen tester, so it's kind of cool to have that.

665
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,220
So I'm definitely getting one.

666
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,880
And then on the back they have, there is no security on this earth.

667
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,800
There is only opportunity, General MacArthur.

668
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,240
Pretty hardcore.

669
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,440
Pretty hardcore.

670
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,360
And it's just, they're selling it for basically no profit, $15.

671
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,960
So maybe buy two, because they're not going to make any money at $15.

672
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,960
But it's pretty cool.

673
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,960
Yeah.

674
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,960
No, that's true.

675
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,960
I would have gone a little higher.

676
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:49,960
You know, don't you?

677
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
I think buy two would be the way to go.

678
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
You do know.

679
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
At $15, you don't make nothing.

680
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,820
Teespring.com slash archassault dash at dash SELF or just find the link in the show notes.

681
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,080
And good luck to the Arch Assault guys.

682
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,320
They were put on a good show there last year.

683
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,360
And I think you should definitely check it out.

684
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,360
All right.

685
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,820
So I know I've been teasing it for a long time.

686
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,300
And I want to clear room for it.

687
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,460
So I wanted to just take a moment right now.

688
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,020
And I want to, right before we bring Mr. Saigo in, I want to mention DigitalOcean.

689
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,480
Because I think they're so awesome that we've got to just take a minute and mention them.

690
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,520
And then we'll start talking to Aaron.

691
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,520
I love DigitalOcean.

692
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
I love them.

693
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,720
I love them because my son, I was really, really excited to get him to try a Linux rig.

694
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,440
And the candy that got him to like swallow it was Minecraft.

695
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,400
And then I'm like, okay, well, we have a Minecraft server for the Jupyter Broadcasting community,

696
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,640
but it requires a slightly older version of Minecraft.

697
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,660
And I'm not so sure I want him on the public just yet.

698
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:47,920
So I went over to DigitalOcean and I set myself up a Minecraft server.

699
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,720
Just a really straightforward process.

700
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,600
It took no time at all because I get root access to my own cloud server up at DigitalOcean.

701
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,720
And it is super intuitive and very easy to get started.

702
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,520
So I knew I was going to get a great Linux rig.

703
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,640
I knew I could throw Minecraft on there in no time.

704
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,440
I got started in less than 55 seconds.

705
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,760
And pricing plans, they start at only $5 a month.

706
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,280
Then I get you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, yeah, they're all SSDs by the

707
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,380
way, one CPU and a terabyte of transfer.

708
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:18,280
Now since I'm doing Minecraft, I decided to go with two gigs of RAM and I think I have

709
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,620
a 40 gigabyte SSD.

710
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,280
It's really straightforward, the pricing structure.

711
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,520
And they even offer hourly pricing.

712
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,240
If you just need to do some software testing or something like that, just go spin up a

713
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:31,040
droplet up there, throw something in a Docker container and bang on it for a couple of hours

714
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
and you're done.

715
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,460
And the thing I love about that is they make it really easy to deploy Docker containers.

716
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,160
So you could be working locally on your laptop or your desktop and when you're ready to actually

717
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,920
test it, maybe you want to throw it on a public IP, you don't want to have to bug IT to open

718
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,760
up a port on the IP or on the firewall, you know, just throw it up on a DigitalOcean droplet

719
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,720
for a couple of hours, have the public tester bang on it, get your test results in and then

720
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,880
shut it down.

721
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,880
It's really cheap.

722
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,140
And they have an incredible interface to do all of this and this is sort of the secret

723
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,140
sauce here.

724
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:59,760
It's very intuitive and power users could replicate on a larger scale with their straightforward

725
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,760
API.

726
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,840
They could automate that process and that's starting to get pretty powerful.

727
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,800
And they've got data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

728
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,040
London and a brand new one in Germany that's gorgeous with great connectivity, really a

729
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,720
central point over there.

730
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,400
And when you look at all of this, you're thinking, okay, this is a pretty good package.

731
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,640
And I'll tell you from a technology standpoint, I'm all in.

732
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,360
It's based on Linux, they're using KVM for the virtualizer, it's SSDs for the IOs, so

733
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,600
you get super high-end IOs, you don't need a full like fiber attached RAID full of 10,000

734
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:35,480
RPM for 15,000 RPM spinning rust, you just have a great SSD and it's really easy to expand

735
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
that.

736
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,600
They can do that inside the interface, you don't have to reload the box or anything like

737
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
that.

738
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,680
You've got one-click deployment of applications, Ruby on Rails, Docker, GitLab, Ghost, WordPress,

739
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,760
all the good stuff, one button deploys it.

740
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,600
And then on top of all of that, they have the best tutorials on the internet.

741
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,160
And I'm just going to say that because it's like I noticed this started to happen with

742
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,440
Arch a few years ago.

743
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,800
You start to search for stuff and a lot of time the Arch wiki result shows up saying,

744
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,040
man, Arch has pretty good documentation, that's good.

745
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,920
Even before I used Arch, I knew Arch had good documentation, everybody knows that, right?

746
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,200
That's what's happening over DigitalOcean because they started to pay their contributors

747
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,800
up to $200 to write these tutorials.

748
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,960
And then they realized, okay, well now we need an editing staff.

749
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,840
So then they invested in hiring editors to curate and edit the how-tos and they keep

750
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,220
them relevant and current.

751
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,660
And when they roll out a new technology like FreeBSD, they roll out a whole host of tutorials

752
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,660
to match that.

753
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,440
It's an end-to-end thing they do.

754
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,200
It's a complete product, complete package, and it's super respectable and they do it

755
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,200
right.

756
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,200
And here's the best part.

757
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,120
You can get a $10 promo, you can try it two months absolutely free when you use the promo

758
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,520
code DOUNPLUG.

759
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,560
You create your account, no credit card required, you just apply it.

760
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,560
DOUNPLUG, one word, lowercase.

761
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,280
That'll give you a $10 credit.

762
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,520
Go try out CoreOS.

763
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,520
It is a game changer.

764
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,760
CoreOS is going to change the enterprise.

765
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,260
You can go try it out.

766
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,880
FreeBSD's up there, I don't know why you'd want that.

767
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,220
They've got Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, all that good stuff's up there.

768
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,560
You can go deploy applications.

769
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,320
It's really good.

770
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,760
You could even go like baller style where like, you know what, don't even bother with

771
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,320
like starting to just deploy the whole thing.

772
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,840
Ubuntu 14.04 up to date with the entire LAMP stack, MySQL ready to go, boom, done.

773
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,840
You've got it.

774
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,240
Seriously, it's a great way to go.

775
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,420
Use the promo code DOUNPLUG and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

776
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,800
You guys, freaking maniacs over there with all this stuff.

777
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,520
I'm really impressed with the pace of innovation.

778
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,520
I don't know how they do it.

779
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,600
You know, I talked to the people on the inside and not only do they do it, but they kind

780
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,080
of do it with a good attitude.

781
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,080
It's kind of remarkable.

782
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,440
I think it's because they're on the East Coast.

783
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
Maybe that's what it is.

784
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,440
Yeah, that definitely helps.

785
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,440
Sure.

786
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,920
I think on the West Coast, we don't quite work at that same speed.

787
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,640
Well, Matt, I'm super excited to welcome Aaron Seigo, friend of the show and his new jingle

788
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,640
because he's a returning guest, Mr. Aaron Seigo is now working for a new company.

789
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,640
Is it CoLab?

790
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,120
CoLab Systems, Aaron?

791
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,560
What's the name for the full name?

792
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,840
Yeah, it's CoLab Systems AG.

793
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:56,480
CoLab Systems AG, and here's what I know about CoLab.

794
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,240
It's a free software platform of sort of like an exchange competitor or like a Zimbra competitor,

795
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,780
but a little more open, really respected for privacy, is sort of the hubbub on the street,

796
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:13,080
and it's something that's always been on my bucket list to try.

797
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,280
I was pretty excited when I saw you moved over there, but I don't actually get the connection.

798
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,560
When I think of Aaron Seigo, I think KDE, I think of the Valde tablet.

799
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,920
I don't know if I necessarily thought CoLab, so what are you doing at CoLab, and how's

800
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
it been?

801
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,920
Yeah, so I mean, the connection is, I guess, long term.

802
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:38,120
When CoLab first started, a lot of people that were involved in the project were also

803
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
involved with KDE.

804
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,920
There was a crossover there already, so I kind of knew some of the guys behind it, and

805
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,560
this is back in like 2001, I believe.

806
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,960
And so when it first hit 1.0, I actually deployed it, tried it out.

807
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,880
It was usable.

808
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,760
It was not what we have today, but it was there, and it was definitely a step up.

809
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,680
When CoLab systems started, it was started by a very good friend of mine, Georg Griever,

810
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,460
who lives in the same city that I do now, which is handy, and we'd often talked about

811
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:11,880
doing something together sometime, and late last year, the opportunity came up.

812
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,000
He said, remember how we've always said we should maybe do something sometime, well,

813
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,120
how about it?

814
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:25,600
So I'm there doing two things right now, which is, on the one hand, I'm helping with some

815
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:32,200
of the technology, the architecture of certain pieces of what goes into CoLab.

816
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,160
So on that side, my official title is Senior Technologist, and I work with a couple of

817
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:42,680
other guys that are just fantastic, including people like the lead architect for the entire

818
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,520
Shebang, Yaron.

819
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,560
So that's been great, and the team in general is just fantastic.

820
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:53,660
Just so I kind of am tracking my understanding, is there also like a hosted CoLab company

821
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,120
that is separate but somehow related to CoLab systems?

822
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,480
Yeah.

823
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:05,200
So we started as a proof of concept to show that, well, what can CoLab do?

824
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,200
And so we started CoLab now, and it just so happened that it was launched within about

825
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:19,040
24 hours or so of the Snowden revelations, which was just complete coincidence, we promise.

826
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:27,720
But we had a real focus on privacy, and one of the reasons why it's hosted and managed

827
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,800
entirely within Switzerland is because of the legal framework here, which has a lot

828
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,160
of privacy or a lot of respect for people's privacy, and all the routes for things like

829
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:45,840
requesting data and whatnot are not only very strict on the side of the consumer, the individual,

830
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,080
but also it's a transparent process.

831
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,880
So we never have a gag on us that says, oh, you can't talk about it.

832
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,420
In fact, here, the federal government once a year releases a complete report of every

833
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,760
single wiretap, et cetera, request that they make.

834
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,640
They obviously anonymize it, but they say when, where it basically happened, and for

835
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,760
what reason, what law was enacted in that.

836
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,360
So transparency is a big thing here.

837
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:18,360
So yeah, so CoLab now, we've got a lot of people from all over the world that use that

838
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,200
single system, and that's our hosted version of CoLab.

839
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,440
And of course, a lot of people use CoLab on site.

840
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:34,400
People who are larger institutions, especially they hire us to do support, and we have CoLab

841
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,640
Enterprise for that.

842
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,240
So this is really anybody that needs like an exchange type solution where you have a

843
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:47,020
groupware with calendaring, email, task lists, contacts, resources, and roles, and all these

844
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,100
kinds of things, right?

845
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,240
It's a complete solution for this.

846
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,240
That's right.

847
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,240
Notes as well.

848
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,440
Yeah, and so resource booking, all of those fancy dancy features, and the client side

849
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,640
is all across platform.

850
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:04,080
If you have a Windows phone, Blackberry, iOS device, Android, like most of the rest of

851
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,600
the world, you're covered.

852
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,920
If you run it on Windows, Mac, or Linux, you're covered.

853
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,800
So you choose the client, we run the servers.

854
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,800
And so CoLab has been around, I'm sorry, I think you mentioned it, but did you say 2006?

855
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,160
Well, CoLab itself started in the early 2000s.

856
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,120
CoLab Systems itself has been around in its current form for about four years.

857
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,120
Okay.

858
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:34,000
So now I want to fast forward to this week where I saw you did, or you were involved

859
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,600
with CoLab's announcement for Roundcube's next funding initiative.

860
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,600
They're calling it Roundcube Next.

861
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,280
They're doing it on IndieGoGo.

862
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,640
They have 58 days left.

863
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:51,320
They've raised $13,629 of a goal of $80,000, 17% funded right now.

864
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:55,560
How is Roundcube connected to CoLab and what's going on here?

865
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,560
Yeah.

866
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,520
So we obviously need an amazing world-class kick-ass web app to sit in front of it, right?

867
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:06,280
I mean, if you don't have a web interface, you don't have a group or a server these days.

868
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,200
And Roundcube, I think, has got the best interface out there.

869
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:13,880
Well, the rest of the world agrees with you because it's the most popular free software

870
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,680
webmail app on the internet.

871
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,680
We know over half a million installations, and some of these are serving entire ISP,

872
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,600
ASP communities.

873
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:28,440
So there are millions of people literally every day who access their mail, their contacts,

874
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,760
their calendar, et cetera, through Roundcube.

875
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,400
So the connection between CoLab and Roundcube is that we needed something that was great.

876
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,440
And before, we were using something called Horda, which had its limitations.

877
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,640
And Georg, who I mentioned earlier, my good friend, founder, CEO of the company, he got

878
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:51,640
together with Thomas Bruderley, who lives in Switzerland as well, as it turns out.

879
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:57,440
And they sat down on a veranda with some beer in hand, as one does, and said, hey, we need

880
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,480
a good web app.

881
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,480
You make one.

882
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,480
How can we make this work?

883
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:08,420
And so what ended up happening is Thomas and the other, the second most important developer

884
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:13,160
in terms of contribution and whatnot, both ended up working for CoLab Systems.

885
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:20,640
So for the past few years, we've actually been paying for the large lion's share of

886
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,760
Roundcube development, which we've been very happy to do, because it's an amazing product

887
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,760
and we need it.

888
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,040
So we have no problems with giving back like that.

889
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,760
I don't know if I was quite aware of that level of, I didn't know that level of involvement.

890
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,000
That's actually pretty great.

891
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,520
And so, of course, the number one thing that the internet does is, well, what about?

892
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,400
And they'll pick their favorite dark mail, mail pile, et cetera.

893
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:48,320
Do you have any comments on where Roundcube fits in to some of these others that have

894
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:51,560
also sort of gotten more popularity post Edward Snowden?

895
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,800
Yeah.

896
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,960
So I think that the more options we have, the better.

897
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,120
It's always, I think, a for granted, as long as it's a free software.

898
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,700
Not all the new things are.

899
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:05,800
But what we can say for Roundcube is it has 10 years of history.

900
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,120
It works now.

901
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,960
And we plan to push it forward even further.

902
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,840
I like the way you're doing this, too.

903
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,160
The primary funding is like, OK, we get this primary funding.

904
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,000
We're going to get this core figured out.

905
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
We get to more funding.

906
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,200
We're going to get some of these other things that are really nice to have figured out that

907
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,200
would be really great.

908
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,400
Then there's these stretch goals that are like the filter, the road warrior, the chatter,

909
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,400
the organizer.

910
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,040
It's just an interesting way to sort of display this.

911
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,040
What do you think, Aaron?

912
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:38,240
Are you so far pleased with the traction, $13,000 in two days?

913
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,240
Yeah.

914
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,240
That's fantastic.

915
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,680
We're looking for a total of $80,000 to get the core done.

916
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,840
And we're trying to be realistic about what it takes.

917
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:50,480
We want to make sure we have enough resources to really make this happen.

918
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,280
At the same time, we're going to continue to maintain Roundcube 1.

919
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,120
We have to for clients as well.

920
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:59,680
So it's a fairly big commitment on our part to make this happen.

921
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,760
It's great to see the community of users pitch in.

922
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,080
In fact, we actually just today had cPanel pick up one of the, actually the high-end

923
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,080
perk.

924
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:16,440
So they should be joining our advisory board as a result of that, which is great.

925
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,280
And that's another part of this, right, is it's not just us looking for you to fund what

926
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,280
we're doing, but there are two perk levels which are really aimed at people becoming

927
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,280
more involved.

928
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,820
So one of them is the Backstage Pass.

929
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,800
It's for individuals.

930
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:37,600
And the idea is that you get access to kind of the day-to-day, ongoing what we're doing.

931
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,480
We do it all in the open, but this is a bit more than that.

932
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,240
And you will be looked to back.

933
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:47,760
So we really hope our dedicated users pick that one up, and a number already have.

934
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,640
And then we've got the advisory committee, which is really aimed at large organizations

935
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,120
that use Roundcube as part of their business.

936
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:56,840
cPanel fits that perfectly.

937
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:04,360
And it's an advisory committee that, as one does, you look for sage advice and wisdom

938
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:07,040
from those who rely on you.

939
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,960
So we're trying to make this a full kind of virtuous circle kind of thing.

940
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,640
I see one potential flaw with all of this, one huge flaw, Aaron, I don't know if you've

941
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,400
noticed, it kind of stands out like a sore thumb.

942
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,160
Underneath your promo video, it says, Aaron Saigo, zero Facebook friends.

943
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,560
It's very sad.

944
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,200
It's just like Aaron has no friends, and I realize probably you don't have a Facebook

945
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:30,040
profile, but that's bad marketing.

946
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,200
I feel like that's kind of sad.

947
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,200
That's right.

948
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,200
Feel sad about me.

949
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,200
Fund my own project.

950
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,200
Yeah, there you go.

951
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,200
Good work in your favor.

952
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,200
All right.

953
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,680
So just along the same line of questioning about the Snowden stuff, what about the popular

954
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,760
demand for things like integration of GPG and things like that?

955
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,320
Do you see a place for features like that in a fundraiser like this, or is that something

956
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:56,120
outside of that or something down the road, what are your thoughts?

957
00:47:56,120 --> 00:48:01,400
So all of those stretch goals, the chatter, the organizer, yada, yada, those are actually

958
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:08,320
all applications that will be added to RoundCube Next when it's all done.

959
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:12,440
How fast we get there really relies on the kind of support we see.

960
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:18,640
In amongst all that, GPG support is actually on the roadmap.

961
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,600
It's a bit further down the roadmap because we want to be able to use their calendar first

962
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,120
before they can use GPG to encrypt it.

963
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:30,120
So there's a certain order to the madness there.

964
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,520
But that's already something that's on our roadmap.

965
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,600
In addition to that, so this is also what's kind of exciting to me, and we announced this

966
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:40,640
at the Colab Summit as a Colab initiative in general, but RoundCube is also part of

967
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:45,720
this, where we feel that we've done a really good job with asynchronous communication,

968
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,720
mail calendaring, yada, yada, yada.

969
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,440
And one of the things we're working on really hard this year to bring to the Colab side

970
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:58,880
and we'll be putting into RoundCube Next as well is the synchronous side of it.

971
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:04,520
So that's things like IM, instant messaging, which we'll be using Jabra for, WebRTC video

972
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:14,620
chat, the whole deal, as well as, hold on to your seats, collaborative editing.

973
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:19,360
So this is why we actually had both WebODF and LibreOffice at the Colab Summit.

974
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:24,160
In fact, I have a handy little gif of one of the lead ODF developers and Michael Meeks

975
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,320
sitting down together and smiling over some beers after dinner.

976
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,400
So it's, yeah, this is something we take very seriously.

977
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,400
Oh, this makes me very happy.

978
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,920
So these are all stretch goals that we have that we'd love to hit with the RoundCube Next.

979
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,100
And we have a roadmap that goes all the way through this.

980
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:51,640
And so I suppose this is, if this happens, then you have Colab, something that's becoming

981
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:55,720
more and more relevant really to the open source world, especially, again, post-Nodin

982
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,720
and not to overuse it, but it's true.

983
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,000
And you would have a truly first class mail client.

984
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,620
I mean, at the end of the day, that's what we'd be accomplishing here is we would be

985
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:12,120
integrating the best in web mail with the best of open source groupware collaboration.

986
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:17,920
Yeah, I mean, if you look at it, whenever we talk to people about Colab these days,

987
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,840
in their minds, they often go in one of two routes, right?

988
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:25,600
One is it compared to Exchange on the one hand.

989
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,820
And on the other hand, it is compared to Office 365 or Google Apps.

990
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:39,040
And so we realize that the future is in this integrated online services kind of area where

991
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:45,600
we can offer that full range of messaging and document editing on top of all those other

992
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,600
things.

993
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,640
And there's people in the channel going, but we all want GPG.

994
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,760
And yes, it will come.

995
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,440
One thing is that we want to do it right.

996
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,040
There's a lot of people selling snake oil out there right now saying things like, oh,

997
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,160
we encrypt it on our server.

998
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:06,160
I know of one group that's doing that actually well, but they only do it with email.

999
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,120
But there are others who are saying, yes, we encrypt it, but they hold all the keys,

1000
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,120
which makes it almost useless.

1001
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,240
Doing this right is non-trivial.

1002
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:20,720
And one thing that we commit to within Colab and Roundcube is when we do something, we

1003
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,760
try and do it right or not at all.

1004
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,960
So we will get to GPG support for sure.

1005
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,280
Like I said, it's on our roadmap, and we're committed to doing it properly.

1006
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:39,040
So it's over on Indiegogo right now, Indiegogo Roundcube Next is what you want to search

1007
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,040
for when you get over there.

1008
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,280
We'll have a link in the show notes as well.

1009
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:46,800
So if I wanted to get started with Colab, Aaron, just maybe for an on-premises installation

1010
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,760
or something like that, what would be a good spot to check that out?

1011
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,040
How do I get started?

1012
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,780
Is there a distro that comes preloaded?

1013
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,000
Is it just easier to just set something up and install it, go hosted?

1014
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,560
What's my best option there?

1015
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,560
Yeah.

1016
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,960
So if you go to colab.org, there is documentation.

1017
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,760
As you were talking about earlier, documentation is awesome.

1018
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,680
We've got pretty extensive documentation for many distributions, especially the more popular

1019
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,680
ones.

1020
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:21,480
It is add a repository, run your package managers foo of choice, and you get the packages put

1021
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,480
in.

1022
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,160
And there's a small post-installation routine that you run to put in, OK, what is your domain

1023
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,800
name that you want and et cetera.

1024
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,400
So that's really the easiest way.

1025
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:38,200
Personally, when I'm trying out a new version, I fire up a VM on my machine and install there.

1026
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:43,760
So that'll get you the community version, which is exactly the same as the enterprise

1027
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,760
version.

1028
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:49,480
There is some version drift between the two of them, depending on release dates, but we're

1029
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:50,480
not open core.

1030
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,320
We hold nothing back.

1031
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,720
If you get the community version, you actually get a very good idea of what the enterprise

1032
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,720
version gives you.

1033
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,200
And by not open core, you mean not just the core is open, everything is open.

1034
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,840
We only do free software.

1035
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,040
It's an ethical position for us as a company.

1036
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:12,700
So it's kind of like the Red Hat thing, and that's all we do, no matter what.

1037
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,700
So that'd be the way to go.

1038
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:15,840
Go to Collab.org, check that out.

1039
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:24,400
We just released 3.4 recently-ish, and Collab Enterprise 14 is based on that as well.

1040
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,680
So that was not so long ago.

1041
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:31,920
So we've got some really fresh, good stuff there.

1042
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:38,040
And you've got the usual slate of IRC channels and mailing lists and whatnot.

1043
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,040
Very cool, Aaron.

1044
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,880
Well, anything else you want to touch on before we bump along?

1045
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,680
And I was thinking, if you want to stick around for the rest of the show, we could discuss

1046
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:47,680
more of the GPG stuff.

1047
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,320
Rotten, you wanted to ask about the Road Warrior.

1048
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,960
Go ahead and fire that up before we wrap up.

1049
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,120
Yeah, I couldn't find a description of what that stretch goal meant, so I was just wondering,

1050
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,920
what does Road Warrior entail?

1051
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,720
Yes, we're teasing you.

1052
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:04,280
We will actually explain what all the stretch goals are over the next week, so as a way

1053
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,600
to just kind of continue that communication.

1054
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,280
So yeah, the Road Warrior is actually the collaborative editing.

1055
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,920
He's the guy who's on the road, and he needs to edit documents while he's going.

1056
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,680
So that's a good pick on that one.

1057
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,040
Yeah, before we go on, two really cool things, I think.

1058
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,960
One, you mentioned Docker earlier on.

1059
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:25,960
Yeah.

1060
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,240
One of the things we're doing in terms of deployment is we're actively working and coming

1061
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,880
to a near conclusion of the process of dockerizing the entire thing.

1062
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:34,880
Interesting.

1063
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:35,880
So that you'll be able to run...

1064
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,560
I mean, Colab is a swarm of microservices, really, right?

1065
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,560
Yeah.

1066
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:42,400
We have an LDAP server, IMAP server, SMTP, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1067
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,680
Each of those goes into its own Docker container, so you can install them all on a single VM

1068
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:53,040
or machine, or you can split them up one on each machine, set up fallbacks between the

1069
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,040
different services, et cetera.

1070
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,520
And Docker's going to make that, we think, a lot easier.

1071
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,200
So that's one thing we're doing that's really cool.

1072
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:03,880
Another really fun and cool thing that we're doing, well, I think it's fun and cool because

1073
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:13,000
it's ironic and funny, is in two weeks at the Microsoft Platinum-sponsored Plugfest

1074
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:21,160
event in southern Spain, we will be demoing Mapy, extended Mapy, with Colab, which means

1075
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:26,280
you'll be able to plug in the old, crappy Outlook directly into it, and it'll just go.

1076
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,280
So Outlook will...

1077
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,280
And Outlook will just what?

1078
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,600
Think it's talking to an Exchange server?

1079
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:31,600
That's right.

1080
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,480
We're doing that with the OpenChange people, which is why we had the lead OpenChange developer

1081
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,480
at the Colab Summit.

1082
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,480
That's how we go.

1083
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,480
That's huge.

1084
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,480
That's huge.

1085
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:43,840
Being able to say, I mean, the number one thing when I went into an office and talked

1086
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:48,860
about Zimbra, the first question was, what's the Outlook story?

1087
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:49,860
Every single time.

1088
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:54,160
I mean, people that have worked in Outlook are like, I know guys that they literally

1089
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:59,680
spend their entire workflow inside freaking Outlook, their meeting hounds, and they have

1090
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,680
to have it.

1091
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,240
That's going to be huge, Aaron.

1092
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,240
Yeah.

1093
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:07,480
And I mean, we were a bit concerned because from the free software perspective, Zarafa

1094
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,160
was pretty much the only ones who had this, and they've dropped support for it.

1095
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:18,000
So we will become the only truly free software group or solution out there with this.

1096
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,280
And we're really happy to work with the OpenChange people to make that happen.

1097
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,280
So yeah.

1098
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:27,640
And for the really big institutions, they should come talk to us about things like boring

1099
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,680
things like data loss prevention and audit trails, which we're also bringing online,

1100
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,760
but probably not as interesting to your audience here, but for the corporate audience, that's

1101
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,760
it.

1102
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,760
But necessary.

1103
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:39,760
Yes.

1104
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:40,760
Yeah.

1105
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,760
Yeah, absolutely.

1106
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,760
Cool.

1107
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,760
Wow.

1108
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,760
That is really exciting.

1109
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,760
And audit trails, I can tell you, in industries I worked in before, that is also sometimes

1110
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:47,120
an essential feature.

1111
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:51,760
And one that lacks in most software packages right now, even the ones that tout their audit

1112
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,760
trail functionality.

1113
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:53,760
Yeah.

1114
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:54,760
Tell us about it.

1115
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:59,000
Auditing, audit trails and data loss prevention means we keep an extra copy of your email

1116
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
somewhere on a disk.

1117
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Yeah.

1118
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Yeah.

1119
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Yeah.

1120
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,960
We got really good logs that you can go through.

1121
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:05,960
All right.

1122
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:06,960
Cool.

1123
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,960
Well, that is really exciting.

1124
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,960
And Aaron, you are...

1125
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,200
I know it's...

1126
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,360
What time is it where you're at right now?

1127
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,360
It's late, right?

1128
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,360
It's like 11?

1129
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,360
Yeah.

1130
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,360
No, it's after midnight.

1131
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,360
Okay.

1132
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:21,520
So if you are free to leave, if you want to go crash, you're welcome to stay with us.

1133
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:29,120
We're going to get the pulse from the Mumble Room on their reactions to Ubuntu 15.04 in

1134
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,120
just a moment.

1135
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,120
So that's what we're going to shift gears.

1136
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,800
And of course, if you want to stick around and sort of just do freestyle Q&A after the

1137
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,040
show, you're also welcome, because I'm sure people have lots of questions.

1138
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,480
I wanted, though, because we haven't...

1139
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,480
Because of Linux Fest Northwest, we didn't normally dedicate time like we would to review

1140
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,880
Ubuntu 15.04 outright.

1141
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:51,000
And so I wanted to start the process here on the show to kind of start to make up for

1142
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,840
that and get the Mumble Room's reaction, because I actually have limited experience with 15.04

1143
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:56,840
at this point.

1144
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,840
I've been using Ubuntu Mate.

1145
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:02,400
I do have a few thoughts, and I have a few observations and some funny reactions that

1146
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:07,880
I've noticed in the reviews, plus 15.10 is coming up, but first, got to thank our friends

1147
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:08,880
over at Ting.

1148
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,880
Go to linux.ting.com.

1149
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,440
Everybody in the chat room, will you do this for me right now?

1150
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,280
I want you to try it, because they got something that I think if you try, it's really going

1151
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,280
to make you think.

1152
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,000
So go to linux.ting.com right now.

1153
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,500
Head over there, and I want you to try out the Ting Savings Calculator.

1154
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,500
So go over there.

1155
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,160
We'll do this while I tell you about Ting.

1156
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,400
So click the Savings Calculator.

1157
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:26,640
Start putting in your actual usage.

1158
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,760
Now, what is Ting?

1159
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,760
Ting is truly mobile.

1160
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,760
That makes sense.

1161
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:32,560
No contracts, so there's no early termination fee.

1162
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:33,840
You only pay for what you use.

1163
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,840
You start with the line.

1164
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,960
It's $6, so that's your flat rate right there for that line, and then they just take your

1165
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,560
minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

1166
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,560
They add that up.

1167
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,380
Whatever bucket you fall into, that's what you have to pay.

1168
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:46,980
So for me, it makes it very economical to have three lines, and paying like $30, $40

1169
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,480
for a busy month, because I use Wi-Fi very heavily.

1170
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:53,880
I do a lot of data calling, and I use Telegram, but if something sends me an automated text

1171
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:54,880
message, not a big deal.

1172
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,880
I don't need to buy a whole bunch of text messages for those occasional text messages.

1173
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:01,780
I'll just pay some tiny fraction of an amount when I get one, and Ting has an incredible

1174
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:05,200
dashboard that lets you manage your account really, really nice, activate, deactivate

1175
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,320
devices, transfer them, name them, audit them, really cool stuff.

1176
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:14,120
They have, of course, all the features you'd come to expect, picture messaging, texting,

1177
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,680
voicemail, everything.

1178
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,440
In fact, I shouldn't say it like that.

1179
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,640
They've got way, way, way, way more than you've come to expect, like no hold customer service.

1180
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,080
You can call them at 1-855-TING-FTW.

1181
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,320
Who else has got that, right?

1182
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,800
They've got hotspot and tethering.

1183
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:29,160
You want it, you just turn it on.

1184
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,020
You don't have to have some sort of special plan.

1185
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,080
They're not going to punish you.

1186
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,840
They're not going to slow you down.

1187
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,840
They're not going to say, excuse me, you need a family share plan if you want tethering.

1188
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,560
No, you just go into your operating system and check the box, like the way the OS vendor

1189
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,340
intended it to be.

1190
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,400
That's what's so cool about Ting.

1191
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,400
It's just data to them.

1192
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,020
If you want to use them as ISP, Ting is Honey Badger.

1193
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:49,020
They don't care.

1194
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:50,080
In fact, they love it.

1195
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,600
They just lit up their first Gigabit Fiber customer.

1196
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,600
How about that?

1197
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:54,600
That's pretty exciting.

1198
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,600
Yeah, Ting's getting into Gigabit Fiber.

1199
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,560
They're not going to go crazy, but they're experimenting with this right now.

1200
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:05,040
And they just launched, I guess it looks like Brian Callahan, who's the owner of Rock Bridge

1201
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:09,120
Guitar in Charlottesville, Virginia.

1202
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,680
The first to get Gigabit Internet Fiber with Ting.

1203
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,680
Wow, that's pretty cool.

1204
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:13,960
Man, I'm super jelly.

1205
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,120
I'm super jelly.

1206
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:16,520
But you can get in on Ting's wireless plan.

1207
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:17,640
They got a bunch of great devices.

1208
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,640
They're unlocked.

1209
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,640
You own them outright.

1210
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:23,040
You can get a $9 GSM SIM card and put it in any device that supports SIMs, or you can

1211
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,360
get a device directly from Ting.

1212
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:28,960
They got everything from really great value feature phones up to the highest end smartphones.

1213
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:29,960
Linux.ting.com.

1214
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,720
Go there to support this show.

1215
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:36,380
Linux.ting.com also gets you a $25 discount off one of those devices I just mentioned.

1216
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:42,160
If you have a Ting compatible device, and you probably do because they have a huge GSM

1217
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,600
network now and a huge CMA network.

1218
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:49,600
If you have one of those devices that works on those networks, that $25 will go to a service

1219
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,080
credit.

1220
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:54,700
That service credit will very likely pay for more than your first month.

1221
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,920
That's how great Ting is.

1222
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,800
$25 will probably pay for more than your first month.

1223
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,800
It did mine.

1224
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,760
If you're a super crazy talker or something, I don't know.

1225
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,760
I don't know.

1226
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,760
I'm not judging, but I'm just saying.

1227
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,760
Geez, really?

1228
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:07,760
That's kind of ridiculous.

1229
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,760
Get Skype.

1230
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:09,760
No, I'm kidding.

1231
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,600
No, really, but it will seriously... Plus, they have an early termination relief program

1232
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:17,040
too if you've got a contract right now, and then it really starts adding up.

1233
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:22,080
Linux.ting.com, and a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

1234
01:01:22,080 --> 01:01:24,660
All right, so Mumble Room.

1235
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:27,040
Anybody want to go first with their reactions?

1236
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,040
You know what?

1237
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:31,280
I'm going to ask Wimpy, since he shipped a distro based on it, and then the other people

1238
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,280
can fill in.

1239
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,640
But Wimpy, if you don't mind, what are your initial reactions to the Ubuntu 15.04 release,

1240
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:42,360
either from more of a lower end perspective or from a perspective of the user side?

1241
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:51,400
Well, from my own point of view, I really like the 15.04 release.

1242
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:55,400
In some respects, I prefer it to the 14.04 release.

1243
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:00,880
This is really from an Ubuntu Mate perspective, and that's because you will have noticed that

1244
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:07,600
Debbie and Jesse released a few days after 15.04, so consequently, a lot of the work

1245
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:14,920
that I've been doing in Debian, which has flowed into Ubuntu, was done as part of the

1246
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:19,760
Debian LTS strategy, so it's kind of a shame.

1247
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:25,440
The one drawback of 15.04 is it's only got that nine month support window, because in

1248
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:32,960
terms of Mate implementation, it's really solid, so it's going to be a shame to see

1249
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,440
that one go away in nine months time.

1250
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:44,160
But I think for Ubuntu as a whole, on the desktop, there were some improvements in stock

1251
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:51,160
in Ubuntu, but it's really the under the covers stuff that's really evolved in 15.04.

1252
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,200
So system D, for example, is one area where there's been change.

1253
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:03,440
And then in the server side of things with things like Snappy and Juju and Mass, there's

1254
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,520
been some big advancements.

1255
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:11,280
So I think it's actually quite an important stepping stone release to where, you know,

1256
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,760
Canonical want to get to.

1257
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:16,440
Let me pick one thing out that you mentioned there, and maybe I can rope Popi in here,

1258
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:22,000
because according to the register, everything's fine except for Ubuntu is now full of system

1259
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,940
D. Listen to this, the initial review line starts, system D is here.

1260
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:32,480
It's arrived in Vivid, the latest just released distro of Ubuntu 15.04.

1261
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,960
Essentially, Popi, apparently Canonical has condemned us all to system D. Now, how are

1262
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,080
you feeling about that?

1263
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:48,680
So the day that I switched from Upstart to system D was an ultimately uneventful day.

1264
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,840
I followed you on Google Plus, I remember.

1265
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:51,840
As it should be.

1266
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:52,840
Yeah.

1267
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,640
It was a package update, basically, right?

1268
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:55,640
Right.

1269
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:58,040
And I switched back the other way and then switched forward again.

1270
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:03,320
And actually, in 15.04, if you really, really want to, you can use Upstart, you don't have

1271
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:09,080
to use system D. So, you know, it's not compulsory to use system D if you're that way inclined.

1272
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,440
I did not expect the switch to happen so soon.

1273
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:16,160
So in terms of like full switch over, is there still some sort of like compatibility happening

1274
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:20,880
or like is everything truly like system D scripts and it's all 100% done?

1275
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,200
Well, the desktop is, but the phone isn't.

1276
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:28,000
So the phone is still using Upstart for user sessions.

1277
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,240
So that will switch probably in 15.10.

1278
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:37,940
But there's a whole bunch of stuff that needs to happen for that to actually work.

1279
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:42,640
But yeah, we did it for 15.04, that'll happen for 15.10, no doubt.

1280
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:48,800
Also in 15.04, Upstart still used for X sessions as well.

1281
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:52,520
Yeah, that's not too surprising, I suppose.

1282
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:55,940
So there is a little Upstart still in there for some things.

1283
01:04:55,940 --> 01:05:00,320
But it boots unbelievably fast, unbelievably 15.04 boots fast.

1284
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,640
That was one of my initial impressions.

1285
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:06,080
In fact, Wimpy, you nailed it when you said, I wish 15.04 was going to stick around longer

1286
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,160
because I like it a little bit better than 14.04.

1287
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,120
I like it a lot better than 14.04, actually.

1288
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,680
Yeah, I do.

1289
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,920
It's the system that I'm installing on all my stuff now.

1290
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,320
I've kicked the LTS thing into touch, 15.04.

1291
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:21,240
So are you just going to replace it later then?

1292
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:25,220
Well, for those machines have already got installed, just an upgrade.

1293
01:05:25,220 --> 01:05:29,600
And for those that I'm installing fresh, just going straight to 15.04.

1294
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,640
Anybody else in the Mumber room want to jump in with their impressions?

1295
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:35,800
Matt, if you have any impressions on 15.04, feel free.

1296
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,920
You know, I'm always one of those people who tends to hold off until it's been out till

1297
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:42,120
just to the point where the next release is and then I'm popping into the new one.

1298
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,360
I'm still on LTSs on both of my boxes.

1299
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:45,360
It works for you.

1300
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,360
Yeah, it works for me.

1301
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:51,360
But the speed thing has piqued my interest because that does sound appealing because

1302
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:55,840
some of the machines I use, I do like to turn off and have them boot up reasonably quickly.

1303
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:56,840
So that's cool.

1304
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:57,840
I like that.

1305
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:58,840
So you know what you ought to do then, Matt?

1306
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,840
What's that?

1307
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,840
You ought to hang out and wait for 15.10.

1308
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,840
I mean, I hate the way this happens.

1309
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,800
I hate that they just got out and now we're talking about 15.10.

1310
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:09,680
But we've gotten the code name for Ubuntu 15.10.

1311
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,760
It's going to be called Willy Werewolf, which is kind of silly.

1312
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,760
What?

1313
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:14,760
Wiley.

1314
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,760
Yeah, I read about this.

1315
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:16,760
Wiley.

1316
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:17,760
Sorry, Wiley.

1317
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:18,760
Yes, Wiley.

1318
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,760
Wiley.

1319
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,080
Wiley was a joke I was making earlier, totally unrelated and it got stuck in my head.

1320
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,320
Wiley Werewolf, because Wiley is supposed to be somebody who's wise and crafty, right?

1321
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,720
So yes.

1322
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:36,760
And with an October time frame and the scuttlebutt is to focus on the desktop.

1323
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:39,760
What does that mean, Poby?

1324
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:46,620
So there's the usual desktop release in 15.10, which will have all the usual updates and

1325
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:53,200
probably I'd imagine the new kernel with live kernel patching without having to reboot.

1326
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:55,040
That'll be nice.

1327
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:58,240
And all the usual updates, you know, Firefox, LibreOffice and all that.

1328
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:01,440
So a few other interesting things as well.

1329
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,120
I feel like you're burying the awkward teenage lead, though, and that is this is where we

1330
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:10,160
begin to see like the converged desktop come together, right?

1331
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,800
This is right, isn't it?

1332
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,800
Bits of it.

1333
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,800
Yeah.

1334
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:19,800
I mean, there'll be the I mean, we've already got the Unity Next ISO, which we've had for

1335
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:23,960
four months, but then we're going to integrate Snappy into that.

1336
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:24,960
Here's what I'm trying to get at.

1337
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:25,960
Yeah.

1338
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,760
Here's what I'm trying to get at is I hear it's a full time.

1339
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,960
Tell me what you want to talk about, because you're telling me nothing that you're saying.

1340
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:33,680
You're saying I'm saying it's a focus on the desktop.

1341
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,160
I'm reading it's a focus on the desktop from several news outlets.

1342
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:40,000
But then when I ask what's going to happen on the desktop, I hear Snappy packages and

1343
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,000
I hear a live patching kernel, which are awesome, but they're not desktop.

1344
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I'm just curious.

1345
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
I don't care.

1346
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,880
I'm just it seems like the focus is on desktop.

1347
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,120
I'd be kind of interested to see what that direction goes, because I've I've been one

1348
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,920
of these people really curious where canonical is going to take it eventually.

1349
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:59,920
And I know that it's more like the 16 series before we're going to see Unity eight probably

1350
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,160
be default and things like that.

1351
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,520
But man, I'm just curious.

1352
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:05,440
So I don't know if you were listening to Mark's.

1353
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,440
I haven't.

1354
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:07,440
No, I haven't heard that yet.

1355
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,640
Oh, well, maybe you should have a plan.

1356
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:18,200
He mentioned that 2015 there'll be a convergence device before the end of the year.

1357
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:21,080
So I have I did pull the quote I did manage.

1358
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,400
I did manage to grab that he said I would like to announce that we're going to ship

1359
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:28,560
a device this year with a manufacturer that will fit in your pocket and be a phone and

1360
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,260
give you a desktop experience.

1361
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:34,140
That PC pocket experience is real on Ubuntu.

1362
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:37,560
So am I to interpret that as to sort of the focus on the desktop is the beginning of things

1363
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:40,280
to make that device possible towards later of the year?

1364
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:43,340
Yeah, it kind of goes from both directions.

1365
01:08:43,340 --> 01:08:48,680
So from the desktop, you know, moving towards snappy and also from the phone moving towards

1366
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,680
the desktop.

1367
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,920
So yeah, having a conversion device by 1510.

1368
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,920
Yeah.

1369
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:56,680
So that's what I really wanted is I wanted you to say Ubuntu Teen Wolf is going to focus

1370
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,720
on a brand new software center.

1371
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,720
That's what I wanted you to say.

1372
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:00,720
You software center.

1373
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,720
That's what I wanted.

1374
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,720
Follow me.

1375
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,720
But I know it's not going to happen.

1376
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,720
It's OK.

1377
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,560
I got to wait till you guys are all done because then I'm sure you're going to have to write

1378
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,000
it in whatever is fancy for click backers.

1379
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,480
It already exists on the phone.

1380
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:16,460
The click store already exists on the phone and on the new and on Unity next desktop.

1381
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:19,240
You can open the click store on the desktop right now.

1382
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,240
I guess so.

1383
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,040
And I guess apps work either way.

1384
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:26,080
But do you see do you see that eventually becoming like a full on replacement to the

1385
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,140
software centers, like all of the applications that we get from the software center would

1386
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:30,680
be in there, too?

1387
01:09:30,680 --> 01:09:31,680
Yep.

1388
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:37,920
Oh, the snappy store will be the place where you get apps and you could install a separate

1389
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:38,920
store on there as well.

1390
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:39,920
Isn't that everything?

1391
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:44,800
So eventually then Ubuntu software center would probably just kind of go away.

1392
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,800
Yeah.

1393
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:46,800
Yeah.

1394
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:47,800
OK.

1395
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:48,800
Oh, my God, we need a poppy.

1396
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:49,800
Save us.

1397
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:55,040
It's actually funny, I looked at the change log for software center and there was one

1398
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:01,180
change back in January this year and then the last change to software center was April

1399
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:02,180
the previous year.

1400
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:05,760
So, yeah, software center hasn't had a huge amount of love recently.

1401
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,640
No, but it makes sense if you're moving to something new, I guess.

1402
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:13,440
So any any other thoughts on 1504 before we wrap up?

1403
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:19,240
So the weird thing for me is I've been running 1504 for months, you know, I upgrade early

1404
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,000
and I'm running it as my daily machine.

1405
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,280
So whenever I'm on release day, I'm like, all right, yeah, everyone else is catching

1406
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:27,280
up.

1407
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,280
Yeah, I know.

1408
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:32,320
Because I when I'm usually going to do a review, I try to run it for quite a while before

1409
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:33,320
the review.

1410
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:36,880
So sometimes I'll start sort of late beta RC just to kind of start to get a feel for

1411
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:37,880
it.

1412
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,680
And so it kind of does take away a little bit of the the excitement on release takes

1413
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,360
like, yeah, OK.

1414
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:46,040
What release day usually means for me is I get a few more package updates.

1415
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:48,060
That's usually what release day means.

1416
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:51,000
And overall seems to be reviewed pretty well.

1417
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,400
That register piece, I think, was a bit tongue in cheek about the system stuff because it's

1418
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,760
really been a non story.

1419
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,680
And it seems to be a pretty positive reaction overall.

1420
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:00,460
The meta review would be it's good.

1421
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,820
Not too many changes, but it's still good.

1422
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:03,960
And I think that's not a bad place to be.

1423
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:07,920
There's actually a cool feature that the upstart syntax still works.

1424
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,800
And when you activate it, it kind of sends a script through system D.

1425
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,800
Neat.

1426
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:17,420
Corky, you wanted to give Kabuntu some airtime.

1427
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:22,280
I'm not a user, but I've been using Plasma 5 recently on Arch.

1428
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:28,440
And isn't it 1504 is the first to do default Plasma 5.

1429
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:37,160
And yes, from initial reviews, it's just fantastic for a first time default desktop environment.

1430
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:38,160
That is great.

1431
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:41,560
I have also been playing with Plasma 5.3 over the weekend.

1432
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:44,560
I found it to be a little buggy, but nice.

1433
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,160
And I've only seen good feedback about Plasma 5 in 1504.

1434
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:53,760
So I'm using 5.3, but I'm doing it under a high DPI display, which makes it a little

1435
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,320
trickier because KDE doesn't quite.

1436
01:11:55,320 --> 01:12:00,000
So what you do is you go scale up your icons, and you go scale up the text DPI, and you

1437
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:03,400
go tweak about four or five spots in KDE.

1438
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:06,280
And it's actually pretty darn nice on high DPI.

1439
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:14,280
And the breeze theme with Plasma and the breeze icons and all of that stuff look really sharp.

1440
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:19,680
The Plasma desktop, I think 5, now they're shipping 5.2 in Kubuntu 1504.

1441
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,680
That's a really good release.

1442
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:26,080
I think 5.3 may be slightly buggier, but also 5.3 introduces a lot of nice new features

1443
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,320
for laptops.

1444
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:31,800
So it's kind of, and the new media center demos in there.

1445
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:36,260
So yeah, you're right, Kubuntu 1504 is a fantastic release.

1446
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:40,200
And if you've been looking for a well implemented Plasma desktop, sounds like that could be

1447
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,200
a really good one.

1448
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:48,600
And if you're on Arch, 5.3 recently hit the repos, and it's really nice.

1449
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:53,360
Only reason I went back to GNOME is I started having sound problems again.

1450
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:59,600
And what happens is under 5.3 is it's after I get a notification on the desktop, I get

1451
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,000
another notification immediately after that saying, I have changed the sound device to

1452
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,960
Intel HDMI out.

1453
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:06,960
Would you like to revert?

1454
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:13,640
I have to click revert, and then it goes back to my Intel standard HD audio, whatever it

1455
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:14,640
is.

1456
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,160
And then it happens in a few minutes later.

1457
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:20,560
So between that and a few other things, I just went back to GNOME.

1458
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,200
But it's really, really good.

1459
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,560
Ww, you had something you wanted to add on Plasma.

1460
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:31,880
Yeah, I had nothing but issues with Plasma 5.2 on my Intel laptop with Nvidia.

1461
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:39,080
Once I went from the Novu driver to a Nvidia driver, I've had like, I need to track down

1462
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:42,440
this issue or see if others are having it.

1463
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:50,480
I went to rebooting after two minutes after I hit reboot on the menu, it would just finally

1464
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,400
pop up.

1465
01:13:52,400 --> 01:14:00,480
So I eventually went Plasma 5.3 with the back ports, and that works out way better for me.

1466
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:04,480
I still think there's some things that need to be polished out though.

1467
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:11,480
We had a meetup back in October, it was a while ago, where producer Eric and I met up

1468
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,680
with some folks from the KDE project in Seattle.

1469
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,080
And they said, yeah, you know, we're really excited about Plasma 5.

1470
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:21,240
But the one that we think is going to be ready for everybody is Plasma 5.3.

1471
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:24,480
When Plasma 5.3 ships, start telling your listeners to install it, because we think

1472
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:25,480
that's going to be the one.

1473
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:29,360
We'll have a lot of our art stuff done in that one, and all this kind of stuff.

1474
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:33,000
And I got to say, it's very nice.

1475
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,200
It feels, it has right now, this might seem a little brutal, but I had the sensation that

1476
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:41,960
it feels like a race car, like a really high-end race car, kit car.

1477
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,160
Really powerful, crazy fast, the best compositor.

1478
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:48,940
I don't know what it is, guys, but even when I'm typing in freaking console, the way the

1479
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:54,120
text appears in the console feels slicker than the way it does under Gnome Terminal.

1480
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:57,640
And I can't even, like I tried it, and then I logged out and went into Gnome Terminal,

1481
01:14:57,640 --> 01:15:00,280
and I'm like, what are they doing differently?

1482
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,720
And for some reason, it feels smoother under KDE.

1483
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:09,560
It is a slick, fast, smooth experience that every now and then completely falls apart

1484
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:10,560
on me.

1485
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,080
I probably had the Plasma desktop crash on me six or seven times.

1486
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:17,480
And most of the times, it's whenever I'm messing around with widgets, but I don't even have

1487
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:18,480
to be trying a widget.

1488
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,980
If I can just right-click on the desktop, unlock widgets, add widget, scroll through

1489
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:24,840
the widget list, close it, Plasma crashes.

1490
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,640
Oh, okay.

1491
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,040
That kind of stuff.

1492
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:31,280
And I'll give it this, it bounces right back.

1493
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:34,460
It restarts and everything, nothing, I don't lose anything.

1494
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:37,440
It's not really any big consequence, it's just annoying.

1495
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:40,000
Or my sound constantly changing is annoying.

1496
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:45,240
And I feel like it's just a little rough still, but if you are the type of person who likes

1497
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:49,800
that kind of experience, that sort of sports car kit experience, it is great.

1498
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:54,880
It is in a good spot right now, and it's looking better than ever, too, which I'm really pleased

1499
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,880
with.

1500
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,800
So, yeah, there's Dairy Corky, there's your Kubuntu Airtime.

1501
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:03,880
I don't talk about it a lot because I don't use it, but I did happen to run Plasma over

1502
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:07,360
the weekend, and I walked away with those observations.

1503
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,760
All right, guys, I think we're all done.

1504
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:10,880
I think we had a lot to cover.

1505
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:12,280
Aaron, thanks so much for joining us.

1506
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:13,920
If you'd like, we're going to do a little post-show in just a bit.

1507
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:16,440
You can stick around and chat with us.

1508
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,360
Thank you very much, sir.

1509
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,200
And we'd love to have you join us out there live.

1510
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:22,840
I mean you, listener, you, join our virtual lug.

1511
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:24,360
Just go over to jblive.tv.

1512
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:27,280
We do this show on Tuesdays at 2 p.m. Pacific.

1513
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:31,260
You can go to jubilabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted over to your

1514
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:32,260
local time.

1515
01:16:32,260 --> 01:16:35,720
And then you can hang out in our chat room or our mumble room and talk with us as we

1516
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:36,720
do the show.

1517
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:40,680
Matt, is there anything you want to plug or mention before we get out of here today?

1518
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:44,000
Nothing too pressing, however, if you want to keep up with the latest stuff that we have

1519
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,800
going, including how to Linux, which I receive emails on a daily basis about, you can check

1520
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,720
me out at matthartley.com, and you can hit me up with contacts.

1521
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:55,200
You can subscribe to the email alerts, which will tell you when things like how to Linux

1522
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,200
come out.

1523
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,200
So yeah, check that out.

1524
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:58,200
Matthartley.com.

1525
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,400
I'm excited to hear that people are pumped about how to Linux.

1526
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,400
Oh, you should see my inbox.

1527
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,400
Great.

1528
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,360
Don't forget you can fill our inbox too.

1529
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,240
Go to jubilabroadcasting.com slash contact.

1530
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:11,800
Choose Linux Unplugged from the dropdown, or maybe even better, join our subreddit, linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

1531
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:15,160
Makes this show better, community feedback, stories, topics, votes, all that stuff is

1532
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:16,160
great.

1533
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,160
I'd love to see you live, jblive.tv.

1534
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:18,160
All right, everybody.

1535
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:20,900
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1536
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:22,640
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1537
01:17:50,900 --> 01:18:01,660
Okay, we have just a little titles business to take care of before we get out of here.

1538
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:02,660
JBtitles.com.

1539
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:03,660
Everybody go over there and vote.

1540
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:04,660
Or you can still bang suggest.

1541
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:05,980
You still have probably a chance to get your title in too.

1542
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:08,580
Aaron, it's good to catch up with you.

1543
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:10,540
I don't think we've talked since you joined Colab.

1544
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:13,700
No, I don't think we have.

1545
01:18:13,700 --> 01:18:16,540
And when I saw that move, I thought, oh, that's a good one.

1546
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:17,540
That's a good place to go.

1547
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:20,460
And man, the timing and all of that, that was crazy.

1548
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:22,900
We could have worked out a little bit better.

1549
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:23,900
Yeah, no.

1550
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:27,420
And it's, I mean, there's so much to be done in this space.

1551
01:18:27,420 --> 01:18:33,080
And yeah, I know so many of the people involved with it already, it was a pretty easy transition

1552
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:37,340
and yeah, lots to keep me busy and excited.

1553
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:40,500
Blame the chat room is our third position title right now.

1554
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,180
JBtitles, bang suggest.com.

1555
01:18:42,180 --> 01:18:43,180
Everybody vote.

1556
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:50,020
So Aaron, you mentioned open clients for Colab.

1557
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:54,340
I haven't looked at Colab, I'm very sorry.

1558
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:56,500
You mentioned there's clients on multiple platforms.

1559
01:18:56,500 --> 01:19:02,740
Are you talking about like third party clients or are they first party clients that you guys

1560
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:04,600
have developed?

1561
01:19:04,600 --> 01:19:05,820
They're second party clients.

1562
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:13,180
I don't know what that would mean, but yeah, no, we've got Contact, which we actually do

1563
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:17,460
enterprise support for on Windows as well as Linux.

1564
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:22,820
On Mac, we rely on Apple's own apps just because they work really well.

1565
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:26,900
And from our feedback, that's what Mac people prefer to use.

1566
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:31,860
So we support web dev, web cal, or cal dev, blah, blah, blah.

1567
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:35,820
And all of that stuff is supported as first class citizens in the Mac world.

1568
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:44,000
And then on the mobile side, it's mostly active sync with some platforms anyways.

1569
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,700
We do recommend on Android using things like DavDroid because that gives a slightly more

1570
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:51,780
privacy respecting experience.

1571
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:57,540
So it's mostly whatever app the user is familiar with already or whatever app ships with the

1572
01:19:57,540 --> 01:20:02,580
platform already can connect and you provide instructions for connecting to your back end,

1573
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:03,580
right?

1574
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:09,020
Yeah, with the exception of Contact on Windows and Linux.

1575
01:20:09,020 --> 01:20:12,620
And what's used on Android, active sync on Android?

1576
01:20:12,620 --> 01:20:19,900
So on Android, our recommended mix is DavDroid plus canine mail.

1577
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:26,620
And that gives you access to everything, your contacts, your calendars, your email, et cetera.

1578
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:32,860
But if you don't go that road or you can't go that road for some reason or you just want

1579
01:20:32,860 --> 01:20:36,220
to stick with what Android comes with, then active sync also works just fine.

1580
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:41,100
I have devices where I have one or the other, so I've tried both and yeah, they work.

1581
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:42,100
Active sync is cool.

1582
01:20:42,100 --> 01:20:43,100
How about you?

1583
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:46,740
No, no, you don't seem like you're going to break it any second.

1584
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:47,740
Okay, good.

1585
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:52,140
Because I feel like maybe my blood pressure is high right now and I left my watch upstairs

1586
01:20:52,140 --> 01:21:00,620
so I can't take my heart rate, but I tell you, I literally have an A and B comparison.

1587
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:05,920
So here's what I want to admit to right up front before I go any further into this discussion.

1588
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:10,820
This only applies to me and because of my use case scenario where I'm in front of these

1589
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:17,620
two computers for an extended period of time every single day except for Saturdays, I just

1590
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:20,180
think maybe this only applies to me, okay?

1591
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:23,060
I don't even know if it applies to anybody else in the entire freaking universe.

1592
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:24,060
I'm so special.

1593
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:28,180
But here, because I'm such a special unicorn, here is what I have observed.

1594
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:34,460
The stable releases of Linux, their updates break everything just as much as my rolling

1595
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:35,460
release.

1596
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:36,460
No, way more, way more.

1597
01:21:36,460 --> 01:21:37,460
And you know what?

1598
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:39,420
I'm not even going to couch it.

1599
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:43,760
The rolling release breaks way less than the Ubuntu 14.04.

1600
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:44,760
And here's what happens.

1601
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,480
About once a month, I install updates.

1602
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:50,700
Now I cannot recall how long this has been on Ubuntu 14.04, but we're going on like six

1603
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,700
months probably, a little more.

1604
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,300
Here's what I have observed.

1605
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:56,160
About once a month, I install updates.

1606
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:00,060
And if you have watched the jblive.tv stream and we're not live, you may have noticed we

1607
01:22:00,060 --> 01:22:01,820
no longer have videos playing.

1608
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:04,740
We instead are rebroadcasting our audio stream.

1609
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:06,340
Why you might ask?

1610
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:11,940
Because an update to Ubuntu 14.04 broke our capability to play video and same stereo mp3

1611
01:22:11,940 --> 01:22:13,860
audio over the HDMI interface.

1612
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:17,480
We can no longer do that because an update on Ubuntu 14.04 broke that.

1613
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:20,500
So now our live stream just is a replay of our audio stream.

1614
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:26,060
And now today, I did an update yesterday, I noticed today all of the audio interface,

1615
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:28,460
one of the audio interfaces fails to even show up.

1616
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:32,820
I had to completely power cycle the machine, unplug the device, power cycle the machine

1617
01:22:32,820 --> 01:22:36,220
back up, plug the USB device in, and then of course I had to go back in and choose

1618
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:42,140
all of my audio inputs, readjust all of their levels, and all I did was install updates.

1619
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:45,580
The last time I did this, we lost an audio device.

1620
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:51,120
The time before that, our video driver got messed up and it's an Intel video card.

1621
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:56,660
Then almost on a day-by-day basis, maybe about once a week when I'm busy, I update the arch

1622
01:22:56,660 --> 01:22:59,740
box running on my System76 Bonobo.

1623
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:02,900
One is an Intel NUC, one is a System76 Bonobo.

1624
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,140
Both make great Linux machines.

1625
01:23:04,140 --> 01:23:05,840
It's not a hardware thing, okay?

1626
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:08,660
You can take hardware out of this because it's about as vanilla as it gets.

1627
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:14,380
The Bonobo running Arch, getting updates on a rolling release, never fails.

1628
01:23:14,380 --> 01:23:18,180
I cannot do a show without this Bonobo.

1629
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:22,380
It drives all of the visuals, it drives all of the sounds, I can't show a story in a video

1630
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:23,660
without this Bonobo.

1631
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:27,140
It is literally one of the most, besides the machine that actually records the video, it

1632
01:23:27,140 --> 01:23:32,180
is the most important machine in the studio and it runs Arch Linux rolling and it breaks

1633
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:33,220
the least.

1634
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:38,580
The Ubuntu machines and the Macs break more than the Arch Box does and I'm not doing anything

1635
01:23:38,580 --> 01:23:40,300
special.

1636
01:23:40,300 --> 01:23:45,280
So I don't get why everybody always gets on my case about how awful rolling is when in

1637
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:51,280
my experience here, I tell you, the systems that are supposed to be long-term support

1638
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:56,580
seem to break just as much as, or more, and I'm saying just as much because honestly I

1639
01:23:56,580 --> 01:23:57,780
think everybody's going to attack me.

1640
01:23:57,780 --> 01:24:02,540
But I think they break even more, but I'll say they break just as well as the rolling

1641
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:03,860
release machines do.

1642
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:09,860
So what I do not understand is the constant dogpiling when I go out there and say, actually

1643
01:24:09,860 --> 01:24:14,060
I don't think rolling is all that bad, or like when I wanted to switch Angela to a machine

1644
01:24:14,060 --> 01:24:17,140
and it was going to be rolling, the dogpile, oh don't do rolling, don't do rolling, everything's

1645
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:22,060
all going to be all right, well actually my rolling machines break less than my stable

1646
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:23,060
machines.

1647
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:26,660
So how do you guys explain this total dichotomy that I seem to be witnessing?

1648
01:24:26,660 --> 01:24:33,320
I apparently have like jumped through a portal and I am now a slider in an alternative version

1649
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:38,140
of Earth where rolling releases are more stable and long-term supports are more disastrous

1650
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:43,380
and yet nobody else is in the same universe with me, I'm over there all by myself.

1651
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:47,820
It's always like that, Chris, because you know, the rolling release distros have more

1652
01:24:47,820 --> 01:24:53,260
practice in terms of software updates so they can do it a lot more, but they found all the

1653
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:59,420
problems already, the ones that do it every once in a while like Ubuntu, they tend to

1654
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:05,460
just, you know, run into problems or overwrite config files or corner cases that no one cares

1655
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:06,460
about.

1656
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:11,740
Rolling has a lot more practice with updating packages all the time.

1657
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:17,660
That seems pretty reasonable, that seems like a reasonable explanation as to why.

1658
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:23,020
And you know, I always do rolling nowadays, Slackware is like where everything should

1659
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:24,540
be just, you know.

1660
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:28,700
Okay, well here was my theory, heavens, and this is what I wanted to bounce off you.

1661
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:34,980
What if software has gotten better and so it's now not as hazardous to go to the next

1662
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:35,980
version as it used to be?

1663
01:25:35,980 --> 01:25:36,980
Is that possible?

1664
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:42,740
Like, like Linux version 2 was a completely different beast than Linux version 4 is now

1665
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:47,380
and you know, it's a much more mature product now and so is the Nvidia driver and so is

1666
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:49,840
GNOME 3, much, much more mature, right?

1667
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:54,940
So is Chrome and Firefox and GTK and all of these things in the stack now are just much

1668
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:57,700
more mature products.

1669
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:05,300
Yeah, but they'll also when you do coding, right, you usually kind of have a backwards

1670
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:08,060
compatibility thing with your previous version.

1671
01:26:08,060 --> 01:26:15,980
So if a version is only increasing or incrementing by one major version each time as a rolling

1672
01:26:15,980 --> 01:26:21,500
distro versus Ubuntu's maybe skipping two or three versions at a time, they don't have

1673
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:25,980
the backwards compatibility or at least the code in order to say, oh yeah, last release

1674
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:26,980
we've done this.

1675
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:28,620
We've got to change the data structure this way.

1676
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:32,660
Okay, so here's the other thing that kind of I don't get about the, now I know, I think

1677
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:36,380
I eventually did get my kernel updated here, so let me double check real quick.

1678
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:38,380
So I'll do a uname here.

1679
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:40,860
I'm not an RPM fan at all.

1680
01:26:40,860 --> 01:26:42,100
Okay, no, never mind.

1681
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:46,300
So even though I've done a dist upgrade, so I'm on Ubuntu 14.04 and it ships with kernel

1682
01:26:46,300 --> 01:26:47,300
3.13.0.

1683
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:51,540
Now I think there is a way to update that, but I'm an Ubuntu matei, I've done all the,

1684
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:56,320
I've done apt-get update, I've done dist upgrades, I'm on kernel 3.13.

1685
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:59,860
Now this is generally considered not like the best kernel of the three series, right?

1686
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:03,020
This is considered one of the work, worser kernels in terms of performance and other

1687
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,100
things like that.

1688
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:07,180
So it's interesting that they chose this dist, now maybe they've patched it in some way I'm

1689
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:11,300
not aware of, but when they did that choice, I was like, huh, that seems like maybe they

1690
01:27:11,300 --> 01:27:14,740
had an off release and they just happened to land on a bad kernel.

1691
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:19,100
And then 15.04 comes out and the kernel they ship with it has that butterFS problem that

1692
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,460
I ran into.

1693
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:23,500
Like they shipped it with the version that still has the butterFS lockup issue.

1694
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,620
And again, I'm like, what are they doing?

1695
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:28,700
Like aren't they supposed to be curating the best kernel?

1696
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:30,880
Like they picked a bad kernel.

1697
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,820
Like if I was rolling my own dist, I never would have shipped that kernel.

1698
01:27:33,820 --> 01:27:36,360
And maybe again, maybe they fixed it, maybe they patched it, I don't know.

1699
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:39,020
But every time I see it, I think, huh, this seems like they're supposed to be doing a

1700
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,020
really good choice here.

1701
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:43,180
It seems like they've almost just thrown a dart on the board on the current kernel.

1702
01:27:43,180 --> 01:27:47,140
Like, well, we're going to release around this time, so boom, we'll go with that kernel.

1703
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:49,580
And they just, that's all the thought that goes into it.

1704
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:53,220
Not like, well, this kernel is known to have issues with lots of butterFS instances where

1705
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:54,960
you can't mount the root file system.

1706
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:59,380
Like that didn't seem to be like maybe a major issue and oh yeah, by the way, it only seems

1707
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:01,920
to hit like after three to five weeks of being used.

1708
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:05,460
So we'll have a whole bunch of people at 15.04 that all of a sudden hit this.

1709
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:08,740
Like that was not part of the discussion apparently, or maybe it was and they fixed it, but it

1710
01:28:08,740 --> 01:28:09,820
was never noted.

1711
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:10,820
I don't know.

1712
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:14,980
So again, with rolling, this is an issue I don't run into it.

1713
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:18,420
Just if it, like I had that kernel and then it pretty quickly gets replaced with the next

1714
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:19,420
kernel.

1715
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:25,380
But now here on this Mate box, I'm on kernel 3.13 still, which is a clunker.

1716
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:31,860
I've got a maintenance, I mean a Linux Mint install for a friend of mine and their little

1717
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:37,340
Linux kernel version manager is a, I guess the best thing you can get close to that.

1718
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:44,420
But if I ever, ever run Ubuntu, I always use the daily builds of the kernels from their

1719
01:28:44,420 --> 01:28:47,340
like FTP server.

1720
01:28:47,340 --> 01:28:50,420
Just the actual daily current builds of current kernels.

1721
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:53,060
I never use what's in Ubuntu's repositories.

1722
01:28:53,060 --> 01:28:54,060
Ever.

1723
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:55,060
Really?

1724
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:56,060
I don't know.

1725
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:58,540
That seems like you're asking for it, but I don't know.

1726
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:04,100
Well, I run completely their daily dot dev files, screw running the kernels that they

1727
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:05,100
put on the refills.

1728
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:06,100
You do daily?

1729
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:08,100
Daily kernel?

1730
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:09,100
Yeah.

1731
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:11,540
They build kernels daily on their site.

1732
01:29:11,540 --> 01:29:13,260
I can find the link for it.

1733
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:14,980
Why do you want a daily kernel though?

1734
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:17,980
Oh, it's always the best of the best.

1735
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:18,980
All right.

1736
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:20,980
Bugs yesterday aren't a bug now.

1737
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:22,500
No, I'm not a bad mood.

1738
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:28,180
I just, what I'm trying to put together in my head is what appears to be my practical

1739
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:29,180
experience.

1740
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:31,620
And you know, it's not just like these two machines either.

1741
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:39,660
I've got, here in the studio, we have one, two, three, four computers that are running

1742
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:40,660
Arch.

1743
01:29:40,660 --> 01:29:45,660
Well, I guess, yeah, I'm counting, I guess let's just count one of the VMs right now.

1744
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:48,100
We're just really using one of them heavily.

1745
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:51,940
And that's, you know, and then I have at my house two machines running Arch, and then

1746
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:58,340
I have a DigitalOcean droplet running Arch, and I have another DigitalOcean droplet running

1747
01:29:58,340 --> 01:30:01,340
Arch that just runs Minecraft, doesn't really do anything.

1748
01:30:01,340 --> 01:30:05,460
And all of these, I sort of, none of them are updated at any of the same intervals.

1749
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:07,220
Some of them are updated very frequently.

1750
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:14,020
Some of them are updated like once every three months maybe, like the VMs, and none of them

1751
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:17,260
exhibit issues like this.

1752
01:30:17,260 --> 01:30:20,540
And I'm not like doing anything all that savvy, really.

1753
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:25,620
I'm just doing the updates and I'm watching if there's an error, which in fact there's

1754
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:30,580
so infrequently errors that I have to be mindful about watching for it because you know, it

1755
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:33,140
is that one time you relax that it will make a mistake.

1756
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:36,660
And you can check the news, you can check the forums.

1757
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:38,660
So here's my point because I'm rambling.

1758
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:44,100
My point is, in my experience, it really does not seem to be one is more dangerous than

1759
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:45,140
the other.

1760
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:50,000
They both seem to need equal amounts of lots of love and attention when you're doing updates.

1761
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,940
And I feel like there is a little bit of techno fear in the community about rolling.

1762
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:58,940
I think people are inherently a little scared of software.

1763
01:30:58,940 --> 01:31:02,860
And I think also these are the same people who also sort of revere software developers

1764
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:07,200
as sort of unique creators that are sort of a step above everybody else and not just people

1765
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:08,940
who have a talent in a specific area.

1766
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:12,860
I think it kind of plays into that same kind of culture and that culture also bothers me

1767
01:31:12,860 --> 01:31:16,020
because I think it sort of creates like these egos that don't need to exist.

1768
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:17,540
Anyways, I'm again rambling.

1769
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:21,220
I think all of these things come together where it feels like I'm pushing up against

1770
01:31:21,220 --> 01:31:23,980
something that is a bit of a bias.

1771
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:27,180
And it's not like it's really, it's a first world bias, it's not like it's that important,

1772
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:28,180
but it bothers me.

1773
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:33,280
I feel like it's not an injustice, but close to it.

1774
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:37,820
And so I feel like I should be rallied to the cause to defend a truth out there that

1775
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:38,820
people are ignoring.

1776
01:31:38,820 --> 01:31:42,260
I don't know why I feel that way about this particular matter, but I do.

1777
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:47,580
And I think part of the reason is because I was 100% on the other end of the spectrum

1778
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:48,580
at one point.

1779
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:50,860
I was the enterprise Linux guy.

1780
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:55,180
I was Soos enterprise Linux guy and Red Hat enterprise Linux guy.

1781
01:31:55,180 --> 01:31:59,700
I tried Gentoo for a while and I thought it was amazing and I like swung way, way back

1782
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:03,820
to enterprise and I did FreeBSD and I did the enterprise distros for a little while.

1783
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:07,100
And then I went to Ubuntu and you guys know the arc of that in the show.

1784
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:08,780
I was very much an Ubuntu guy on the show.

1785
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:14,500
I very, very hand, very readily, handily dismissed Arch and it's been a transition for me.

1786
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:18,940
And now I'm at the other end of the transition and looking back and I'm going, okay, I think

1787
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:23,380
I made a mistake and I think I'm seeing the same mistake other people are making and I'm

1788
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:26,780
not trying to preach some sort of gospel, but I'm just trying to open up the way people

1789
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:31,060
look at software because if you're into Linux and you're into this kind of stuff, it's very

1790
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:33,920
satisfying and it's very fun to watch.

1791
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,560
And I don't think it deserves sort of the constant criticism it seems to receive.

1792
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:44,280
And I'm a little ashamed that my show has become one of the platforms to perpetuate

1793
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:48,140
that criticism that I think there is a space to criticize.

1794
01:32:48,140 --> 01:32:52,180
I think it's totally worth criticizing because there are risks because new software inherently

1795
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:55,140
can have regressions or flaws.

1796
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:56,980
So there's totally a space for debate about it.

1797
01:32:56,980 --> 01:33:00,500
I'm not trying to say there isn't, but at the same time, I don't think we should shame

1798
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,400
software just because it's rolling.

1799
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:05,380
And I kind of regret that that's the direction the conversation went now that I think about

1800
01:33:05,380 --> 01:33:09,340
it when it came to regards to Angela's computer.

1801
01:33:09,340 --> 01:33:15,420
There is a direct analogy to newsfeeds or news that evolves throughout time.

1802
01:33:15,420 --> 01:33:19,820
After a news story breaks, it evolves and changes and it gets more clear.

1803
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:23,100
That's exactly how a rolling update distro is like.

1804
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:29,260
You subscribe to the newsfeed, but the newsfeed is just packages.

1805
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:33,900
You get the newest news every day and you're up to date and you're not left behind in the

1806
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:34,900
dust.

1807
01:33:34,900 --> 01:33:35,900
That's very interesting.

1808
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,540
That is a very interesting analogy.

1809
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:38,540
You're right.

1810
01:33:38,540 --> 01:33:43,260
It's almost like a newspaper is a capture of the headlines in the state when they're

1811
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:44,760
sort of new and fresh.

1812
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:49,140
But online news, and especially like what we do here in this show, it's really...

1813
01:33:49,140 --> 01:33:50,140
Yeah.

1814
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:55,140
It's like we collect and it's a longer analysis after some time has evolved.

1815
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:59,460
And you're right, the story is more clear.

1816
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:00,460
That is very interesting.

1817
01:34:00,460 --> 01:34:04,020
I mean, that's sort of like what it is, right, in a weird way in software.

1818
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:10,700
It becomes better and what the software developers are going for becomes more refined.

1819
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:15,980
They don't have much time to hide bad problems or let's say oopsies that they make.

1820
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:19,340
They have to live up and be accountable for what they do.

1821
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:46,420
That's what I like being daily or as up to date as I possibly can.
