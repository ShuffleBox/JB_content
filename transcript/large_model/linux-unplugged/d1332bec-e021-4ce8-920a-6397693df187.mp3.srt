1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Talk about controversy, it looks like Ubuntu MATE 2204

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,920
is gonna support Flatpak out of the box.

3
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,240
Yeah, I guess this just means having Flatpak installed,

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,000
no FlatHub or anything by default just yet.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,920
Oh, okay.

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,240
I mean, it actually just feels like

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,480
it just makes a lot of sense.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,120
Does make a lot of sense.

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,440
It makes software easier to install.

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,960
So if you have both snaps and Flatpaks,

11
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,600
then you really can have anything on a system, right?

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,680
But, I mean, let's be honest,

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,560
it is notable that a major Ubuntu flavor is doing this.

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,600
That actually does kind of seem like a big deal.

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,040
Hopefully it's the first step

16
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,680
to FlatHub being there someday.

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,680
Oh, hey there and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,840
My name is Chris.

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,800
My name is Wes.

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,000
And my name is Brent.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,960
Hello, gentlemen.

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,600
Nice being here with you today.

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,420
Coming up on the show,

24
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,680
what's going on with Ubuntu?

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,680
We're gonna run down the issues that we see.

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,360
We've been dancing around this

27
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,760
and taking different passes at it.

28
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,440
But today we're gonna take it head on.

29
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,160
Our thoughts on the new Ubuntu Pro integration

30
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,160
that's been announced for 20204,

31
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,840
where we think all of this could be going

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,160
in the state of Ubuntu.

33
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,760
And then we'll round out the show with some great feedback,

34
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,980
some really great feedback, some pics and a lot more.

35
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,740
There's a whole bunch of show today.

36
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,480
So before we go any further,

37
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,280
let's say time appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,420
Hello, Mumble Room.

39
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,160
Hello. Hello.

40
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,160
Hello, Chris. Hello, Wes.

41
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Hello, everybody.

42
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,580
30 strong going today.

43
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,360
Nice to have some up in the quiet listening.

44
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,960
This is great joining us on a Sunday.

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,660
Oh yeah, all wearing their uniforms,

46
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,080
just like we asked them to.

47
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,700
Well, it helps when you hand them out for free.

48
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,540
That's right.

49
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,880
You know, that does help.

50
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,280
So before we get going, we gotta acknowledge

51
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,380
there's just a little behind the scenes thing going on

52
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,540
during the show today.

53
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,920
And I just wanna get it out in the open

54
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
in case something seems a little off.

55
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,260
As we record, Brent is providing remote tech support,

56
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,960
remote operational support for my wife,

57
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,720
who is back at the RV right now, Lady Joups,

58
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,220
affecting emergency repairs.

59
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,060
How's it going on the ground, Brent?

60
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,300
Brent is two-timing us?

61
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,140
Yeah, yeah. What?

62
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,440
I know, he's multitasking.

63
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,640
I mean, I'm trying to just, you know, be the best me I can.

64
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,280
What I'm getting is really photographs, Chris,

65
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,020
of your RV wires that look like they've been chewed

66
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,440
by a bunch of rats.

67
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,240
Well, I don't know about a bunch, but it's bad.

68
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,920
It's worse than bad.

69
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,140
It's, oh my God, scary.

70
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,640
We just came across something.

71
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,480
All right, okay, all right.

72
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,680
Stay a while and listen.

73
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,780
It all comes back to when we got stuck out in the woods,

74
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,880
when it got real cold,

75
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,360
and we were snowed in for a week.

76
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,240
You freeze out.

77
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,280
So we brought Lady Joups back to a safe spot,

78
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,640
and she was frozen solid.

79
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,160
The tanks were all frozen.

80
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,720
So we put in heaters, we took all the steps we could,

81
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,200
and then we abandoned ship for a week,

82
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,980
and we crashed at the studio.

83
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,620
And while we were gone,

84
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,420
and probably because it was so damn cold outside,

85
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,300
a rat got inside the RV.

86
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,760
I knew something was wrong,

87
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,940
because I have motion sensors around Lady Joups,

88
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,260
and a couple of nights in a row,

89
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,460
my motion sensors went off.

90
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,260
So it's either that or a new ghost.

91
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,580
Yeah, could be totally, you know, I'm always looking.

92
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,300
But the cameras never caught anything.

93
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,940
Like, the cameras would snap on,

94
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,460
and by the time the cameras initialized,

95
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,680
which is like, you know, two, three seconds,

96
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,260
whatever triggered the motion sensor was gone.

97
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,420
Until one night, I looked at my phone in the morning,

98
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,860
and I saw, unlike, I think, I guess it's the axle,

99
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,820
I saw a big fat rat running along the axle of Lady Joups.

100
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,380
And that's when I was like, oh no, right?

101
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,700
Okay, we got a problem.

102
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,060
So let's go pack up Lady Joups.

103
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,120
Let's get out of here.

104
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,960
There's rats.

105
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,180
I mean, if your home can move,

106
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,780
this is one of the times to move it.

107
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,300
I don't want them, you know, doing any damage.

108
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,140
So we get in there,

109
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,540
and we were spending the whole day yesterday

110
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,500
getting her packed up, doing all kinds of stuff.

111
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,900
And of course, we had to run down to the studio

112
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,460
and pick up some supplies that we had hired.

113
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,300
Of course.

114
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,380
So we're running down to the studio,

115
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,860
not once, but twice to grab stuff,

116
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,820
running back up to the RV.

117
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,900
It's taken us all day.

118
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,180
We've got kids running around.

119
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,000
Their friends are coming over.

120
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,940
All right, well, we packed up in another hour.

121
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,780
Another hour.

122
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,900
That's exactly the scenario.

123
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,780
Like, okay, how much longer can I play?

124
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,860
You got about an hour.

125
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,160
And then two hours go by.

126
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,460
So we get everything ready.

127
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,740
The sun is setting.

128
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,300
We're way later than we wanted to be,

129
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,020
but we got to get out of there to protect lady tubes.

130
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,460
And I go to check the tanks.

131
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,300
Make sure we, you know,

132
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,560
if we need to take any water on board

133
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,180
or anything like that.

134
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,540
And it has these little lights,

135
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,860
these little LED lights that light up

136
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,940
to indicate how full it is.

137
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,080
And the light panel comes on for a moment,

138
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,860
and then sort of blinks and fades out.

139
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,700
Uh-oh.

140
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,860
And then none of the buttons work.

141
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,380
And I start going, oh, that's not good.

142
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,680
But you know, she's like six, seven years old.

143
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,520
These things happen.

144
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,340
We were on rough roads.

145
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,500
Maybe there's a wire loose.

146
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,340
Yeah, sure.

147
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,380
So we keep packing up.

148
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,500
I bring in the living room slide.

149
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,640
That was the slide that we were having problems

150
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,480
that sent us to Tucson.

151
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,560
I bring in the living room slide.

152
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,000
I bring in the bedroom slide.

153
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,940
We keep packing up.

154
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,160
Kids are running around.

155
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,400
I hit the button to bring in the kitchen slide,

156
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,160
and nothing happens.

157
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,640
No noise, no air lights.

158
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,700
It's like I didn't even push the button.

159
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,700
So I hit the extend,

160
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
and I hear the motor spin up.

161
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,120
Neat, and they start,

162
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,960
but then there's nowhere to go

163
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,300
because it's already extended.

164
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,840
So then I push the retract button.

165
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,680
Nothing.

166
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,760
And I start doing the math,

167
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,000
and I start thinking,

168
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,920
okay, I saw a rat running on the axle.

169
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,440
My LED lights just went out on my status indicators,

170
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,080
and now this button doesn't work, right?

171
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,880
I'm just adding it all up.

172
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,000
And so from about 10 minutes after that point,

173
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,080
we had a couple of the false floors in our cupboards removed

174
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,440
where there's some different clusters of wiring.

175
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,480
And we found, yeah, a rat got in there

176
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,560
and chewed up the wiring that controls the slide.

177
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,440
Of course.

178
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,880
So I'm shutting down all the power.

179
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,080
I'm shutting down my servers, my telcos.

180
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,760
Everything's getting all shut down

181
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,020
as we're re-patching up wiring.

182
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,040
So that way we can try to get juice out of there.

183
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,460
It has been like, really since Tucson,

184
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,160
the environment, mother nature has been out to destroy us.

185
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,360
That's really how it's been.

186
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,560
Yeah, at this point, it's had to resort

187
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,600
to sending little minions in to help out.

188
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,880
That's next level.

189
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,040
I'm at a point now

190
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,960
where if anybody in the Pacific Northwest

191
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,160
has a large garage with a large driveway

192
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,160
that I could park juice in for about two, three weeks,

193
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,840
so I can affect several different repairs now.

194
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,920
Like I found this wiring

195
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,680
and that wasn't the only wiring they chewed on.

196
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,800
Like if we hadn't found this,

197
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,420
we could have had some sort of disaster.

198
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,160
You did check your brake lines, right?

199
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,400
I gotta check everything.

200
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,560
I gotta go, I gotta pull everything out

201
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,760
and I gotta clean everything, which we have been doing.

202
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,080
And I have to check everything.

203
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,680
I gotta go through every single system.

204
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,080
So I need a place that's dry

205
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,720
because it's raining here all the time.

206
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,040
Ideally rat-free.

207
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Yeah.

208
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,440
Yeah, well that, let me tell you, we went to war, dude.

209
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,320
I am not messing around.

210
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,060
Peppermint, essential oils, noisemakers, traps,

211
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,700
all kinds of stuff set up everywhere.

212
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,500
More cameras deployed so I can see where,

213
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,180
I mean, I don't mess around.

214
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,480
I deploy everything within my power to get these things out.

215
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,040
It's like a whole new game of tower defense

216
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,880
you've got coming up.

217
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,880
We even hired a professional to come out.

218
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,360
Oh, wow.

219
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,840
A local, who knows?

220
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,480
So here's the problem.

221
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,160
The whole damn town, the whole area,

222
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,960
this whole block has rats.

223
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
The whole block has rats.

224
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,520
All the houses have rats.

225
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,660
They're everywhere.

226
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,100
So that's why we just gotta get out of there.

227
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,240
It's like a infestation.

228
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,920
I like how clever this rat was though.

229
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,360
You know, like disabling the slide.

230
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
That's one of the things that can really keep you there.

231
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,560
It really was.

232
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,660
It was a clever maneuver for sure.

233
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,000
So while we're recording the show,

234
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,280
she's back at home trying to repatch these wires together,

235
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,320
cut out the bad spots that have been chewed up

236
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,040
and then connect them back together.

237
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,520
And we'll see.

238
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,560
We'll see if we can get the slide in

239
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,620
and get the hell out of there.

240
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,080
But then I don't know where I'm going.

241
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,120
I don't really have anywhere to go.

242
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,300
So that's always fun.

243
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,600
I mean, I can go back out into the woods,

244
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,400
but how long is that gonna last?

245
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,720
I don't know.

246
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,760
So that's a good time.

247
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,580
That's a good time.

248
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,540
But hopefully Brent will have,

249
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,500
Brent will still have availability for the show

250
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,240
while everything gets patched up.

251
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,060
Tell you what.

252
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:03,900
I mean, how do you even,

253
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,800
you can't even take it to somebody to work on it

254
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,520
when you can't get the slides in.

255
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,840
So as I sit here today,

256
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,560
it has been basically like what,

257
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,760
three or four or five months of mother nature on onslaught.

258
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,080
It's just been crazy.

259
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,040
I can't remember the last week that went by

260
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,220
there wasn't like a pretty precarious joops update

261
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,920
going on at one time or another.

262
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,460
Although sure, you should learn a lot.

263
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,160
Like we're learning like how the wiring works now

264
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,000
on the slides more.

265
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,380
So we figured out how to reverse the wiring.

266
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,700
So that way, even the button,

267
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,640
even when the button only works in one direction,

268
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,440
we can reverse the wiring to change

269
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,980
what that direction of the button does

270
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,820
and that kind of stuff.

271
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,040
And you can actually apply like a nine volt battery

272
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,160
to one of the prongs and it'll activate the motors

273
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,800
because it just needs a signal to tell it to turn on.

274
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,840
Sure, right.

275
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,580
That's all we need.

276
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,660
You got to MacGyver a solution.

277
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,560
At the end of this, you're going to be like customizing,

278
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,100
building out your own rigs.

279
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,840
It's sort of the perfect journey for a Linux user

280
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,680
in that regard.

281
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,920
It really, it does match up really well.

282
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,080
It's just a pain in the butt.

283
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,120
What you need is a, you don't have the hot standby RV

284
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,520
that you can just jump through when you're experiment RV.

285
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,120
Or just live somewhere where it's dry for a bit,

286
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,240
where you can have like,

287
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,240
where you can pull everything out of the rig

288
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,080
and work on it.

289
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,900
Like we've been thinking like,

290
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,180
should we try to escape to Arizona or,

291
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,020
Right.

292
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,840
You know, somewhere where.

293
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,680
Or trade.

294
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,520
Yeah, but that's a whole, that's a whole, you know,

295
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,360
financial thing.

296
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,180
It's a whole trip to plan.

297
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,500
And operational thing, yeah.

298
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,140
We'll figure it out.

299
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,840
We're not, you know, we're not done yet.

300
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,480
We still have a little fight left in us.

301
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,600
And I wonder if that's also true for Ubuntu.

302
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,640
I want to talk about this

303
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,240
because it's something that we've been,

304
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,520
it's one of these things we've been having

305
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,800
a really kind of frank conversation off-mic about.

306
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,120
And we've touched on it in bits in the show.

307
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,040
But we had to sit down

308
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,060
and we really kind of put it all together

309
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:51,920
and realized there's a lot going on with Ubuntu.

310
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,680
And this announcement of the Ubuntu Pro,

311
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,240
it's now going to be baked into the desktop.

312
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,880
So in 2204, when you boot up,

313
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,720
it's going to ask you

314
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,800
if you'd like to subscribe to Ubuntu Pro.

315
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,440
And that started just sort of really,

316
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,180
I think solidifying our thoughts on this topic.

317
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,200
Yeah, and well, rather unfortunately,

318
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,360
when this new Ubuntu Pro integration first rolled out,

319
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
at least in the dailies,

320
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,640
it contained a rather annoying bug.

321
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,320
So like at first it's designed,

322
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,280
it's intended that like, you know,

323
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,600
when you're first booting up here,

324
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
you're first upgraded and you get this,

325
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,640
you just got a little notification.

326
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,920
Hey, do you want to try out this new Ubuntu Pro integration?

327
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,920
Now that notification box asks,

328
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,880
like, no, you know, if you decline.

329
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,720
Yeah, don't remind me.

330
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,640
Don't remind me, I'm cool, okay.

331
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,320
Yeah, that part didn't work.

332
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, you click it, but it just didn't register.

333
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,960
Now, in fact, it made sure it was going to appear next time.

334
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,040
So every time you boot,

335
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,080
even when you'd say, don't remind me,

336
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,900
you'd get this prompt.

337
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,080
Now, to be totally clear,

338
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
these are in the daily images for a beta

339
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,520
that just a tiny, tiny amount of people are using,

340
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,400
but it's not like a great first impression.

341
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,840
No, and it's definitely going to make you ask

342
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,800
because you're going to see it a bunch.

343
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,360
What is Ubuntu Pro?

344
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,080
And I'm not quite sure,

345
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,480
because it seems like maybe it's not all done yet,

346
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,200
but I think essentially it's a rebrand

347
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,000
of the Ubuntu Advantage service, which reminded me,

348
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,680
weren't you using that on a few of the machines?

349
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah, these machines,

350
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,840
these three machines here on the studio desk

351
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,000
are all signed up with Ubuntu Advantage for years now,

352
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,400
since like 2018, when we first deployed them.

353
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:29,880
I signed up, it gives you additional patch support,

354
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,760
so there's like an additional 30 packages they're patching.

355
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,000
It gives you live kernel updates,

356
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and it gives you a central place,

357
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,360
at least Ubuntu Advantage does,

358
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,800
where you can see your machines, see their version,

359
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,960
you get just some basic overall

360
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,960
high level information about them,

361
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,840
which is nice when you're managing multiple machines.

362
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,640
I did pay for it initially,

363
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,200
but then they made a modification

364
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,760
where up to three machines is free,

365
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,560
and it seems like that's gonna be true for Ubuntu Pro as well.

366
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,720
Hey, that's nice.

367
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,680
Yeah, it does look like they're in transition

368
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,160
from Advantage to Pro.

369
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,720
I'm not sure, I think Ubuntu Pro is probably a better name.

370
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,440
It is, yeah, I noticed in the code base,

371
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,400
it's still called Ubuntu Advantage and stuff,

372
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,840
but you know, these things take time.

373
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,240
Yeah, did either one of you guys try it out?

374
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,080
I know we all loaded up the beta recently to give this a go.

375
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,280
Yeah, I did, I mean, I don't know how much

376
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,200
I really need it in my day to day.

377
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,280
I do think like the live patch functionality,

378
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,840
that stuff still fascinates me.

379
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,720
I love that that's even a thing that we can do,

380
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,520
and that it works, and that, you know, like,

381
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,720
but at least on most of my Ubuntu machines,

382
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,560
I don't need that.

383
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,960
I also don't need like a bunch of the stuff

384
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,120
they have in here for compliance and hardening,

385
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,520
but that does seem pretty handy

386
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,120
if you're gonna roll this out for like enterprise desktops.

387
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,120
Yeah, Brad, did you get a chance to try it?

388
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,280
You know, I actually didn't because I wasn't,

389
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,640
I don't know, nothing really stood out to me,

390
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,160
like, hey, yeah, this sounds really interesting,

391
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,600
I'm gonna go try this out.

392
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,480
And I think it's interesting to me,

393
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,960
maybe it frames this whole conversation,

394
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,320
is that we're putting attention on a little indicator.

395
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,240
And I remember a few years ago

396
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,880
when there were so many new features

397
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,360
on every release of Ubuntu that were like super exciting,

398
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,000
and I couldn't even help myself but to jump in

399
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,240
and try things even before they were released.

400
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,200
And there's something about recent times

401
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,680
that I think is worrisome maybe in that way.

402
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,800
Yeah, I see where you're going.

403
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,400
And I think that's why we wanted to talk about this too.

404
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,120
And, you know, I don't necessarily think

405
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,440
this service is a bad idea.

406
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,080
We've recently been talking about ways

407
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,560
to monetize desktop Linux development.

408
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,160
Maybe this is one of those solutions.

409
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,560
That is one of the things I think

410
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,200
that stands out about this as well,

411
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,080
seeing this get a little more focus attention,

412
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,760
a little more draw prompt, you know,

413
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,160
maybe this is an area that Canonical's planning to push on.

414
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,880
Yeah, yeah.

415
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,680
But I don't think it's gonna work.

416
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,560
And I think what Brent was just touching on is part of it.

417
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,320
If you look at, so you're kind of pushing this

418
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
to anybody who gets Ubuntu now.

419
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,160
And most people are gonna deploy it,

420
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,520
in a lot of cases, in a VM for development testing.

421
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,960
Or you have a lot of casual users

422
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,000
who don't really need live patching service

423
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,440
or the compliance stuff.

424
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,240
They're not gonna apply their updates anyway.

425
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,080
Yeah, yeah.

426
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,000
But I actually think there's larger macro problems

427
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,080
that Canonical faces that are gonna prevent this thing

428
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,320
from really being successful.

429
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,080
I mean, beyond just getting a high number of users,

430
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,480
I mean, that may be a thing that they're going for

431
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
is maybe they just want number big.

432
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,280
But I don't think it's gonna be a very successful initiative

433
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,880
because I think, and I don't get any joy in saying this,

434
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,280
the Ubuntu desktop seems like it's in a decline.

435
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,160
If you think about it, if you go back to April of 2017,

436
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,440
Ubuntu had an amazing level of support from the community

437
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,800
when they announced they were switching back to GNOME.

438
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,840
I mean, yeah, some of us were like,

439
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,320
oh, I wish it was Plasma.

440
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,320
But this was 2017 and almost anything Canonical does

441
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,760
is not well received by the community.

442
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,920
But this one was.

443
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,840
Yeah, and it was like, just thinking back to that era,

444
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,760
you know, like when 16.04 had come out,

445
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,240
there'd been changes over to system D,

446
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,560
there'd been experimental ZFS support release.

447
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,640
Like it was just, there were changes happening.

448
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,840
It was a time to pay attention.

449
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,440
Yeah, they really had captured everyone's attention

450
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,280
at that time.

451
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,280
It was a big, big batch of momentum to lose.

452
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,800
And they've kind of been slowly losing it over time.

453
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,320
And I think it all started with Snaps

454
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,200
in this most recent round.

455
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,120
I mean, there's been a lot of things in Canonical's history.

456
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
We could go through all of them.

457
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,120
But I really think Snaps created this weird dynamic

458
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,400
between Canonical and the Linux community.

459
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,960
And some commercial vendors love it, right?

460
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,240
But the average Linux community

461
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,800
just didn't really take to it.

462
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,480
And the uptake for Snaps has been really kind of a grind

463
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,680
for Canonical.

464
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,560
And I think there's been resentment that's built up.

465
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,680
The community resents Canonical for creating Snaps.

466
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,600
And Canonical resents the community for pushing back on,

467
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,880
well, just about anything they've ever done,

468
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,000
including Snaps.

469
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,320
Fair enough.

470
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,000
And I think that exasperation inside Canonical

471
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,880
has built up over the years.

472
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,520
And it led to focus drifting

473
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,880
and focusing on other areas like server and cloud.

474
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,680
And over this time, some of our good friends

475
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,160
that we all know have left Canonical.

476
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,280
And that passion drain has a real impact on a company,

477
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,080
even if they don't want to admit it.

478
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,000
It does, even one or two people leaving like that

479
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,720
can change a company.

480
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,240
But it's a real problem for Canonical

481
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,400
because they make money from the desktop.

482
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,560
Yeah, sure, they make money from the other stuff.

483
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,200
But they make money from those OEM deals

484
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,560
with Dell and HP and others.

485
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,760
And also, having a strong desktop offering

486
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,440
is critical in an overall healthy developer ecosystem.

487
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,920
You gotta have a desktop for people that are building

488
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,840
these apps that are gonna run on Ubuntu.

489
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,720
There's also, maybe it raises a question

490
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,160
for the wider community, as Ubuntu just ends up,

491
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,080
even among some of my friends

492
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,760
who are kind of casual Linux users

493
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,800
who could set up Arch, they know enough to do that.

494
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,080
A lot of them just run Ubuntu

495
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,040
because it's still got that default mentality.

496
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,720
Is that just gonna get a little,

497
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,120
maybe embarrassing is not the right word,

498
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,440
but you could imagine a situation

499
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,960
where if that really continues to see a lack of focus

500
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,960
or polish and just be ashamed to have to either point people

501
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,360
to other options or sort of have some apologetics

502
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,160
and be like, yeah, I mean, that's not really representative

503
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,720
of the best of the Linux desktop.

504
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,920
Well, I think you're starting to see

505
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,680
these red flags already.

506
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,040
And I think Canonical sees these red flags.

507
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,720
I don't think they're blind to these.

508
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,160
The download numbers for the interim releases

509
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,640
sound like they've been lower than typical.

510
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,240
A huge red flag was when Valve announced

511
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,160
the Steam Deck was switching to an Arch base

512
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,560
because that implies behind the scenes,

513
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,280
Valve developers spend hours and hours

514
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,160
moving from a Debian base to an Arch base,

515
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,080
which means that they did the math,

516
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,480
they did the calculation and said,

517
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,160
this is absolutely critical to the success of the device.

518
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,040
We have to allocate time to this.

519
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,440
Canonical saw that.

520
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,000
You know, that's a massive, massive thing.

521
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,360
Recent Linux YouTuber challenges.

522
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,840
They launch, they have their community submit

523
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,920
distros they should try.

524
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,120
And Ubuntu was never even considered.

525
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,120
Manjaro, Gentoo, Pop OS, Mint,

526
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,960
no one suggested Ubuntu.

527
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,400
I mean, you know, kind of an elephant in the room

528
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,640
when that happens.

529
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,000
And when you look at our Tuxies results

530
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,920
that we did recently,

531
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,600
Ubuntu clearly struggled in all of the results

532
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,520
where it was one of the contenders.

533
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,760
And the reality is, is that where enthusiasts tend to go,

534
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,600
then that starts to be what people recommend,

535
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,840
like you were just kind of inferring.

536
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,160
And so now that the enthusiasts are using other distros,

537
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,360
when new people are coming and saying,

538
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,640
what distro should I use?

539
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,840
The answer isn't Ubuntu for a lot of people anymore.

540
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,920
No, not really.

541
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,400
But I think the good news in all of this

542
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,160
is that Canonical seems to have noticed, right?

543
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,080
Like you can look at their actions and they seem to care

544
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,920
because actions are gonna speak a lot louder

545
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,560
than words in this case.

546
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,640
And like they're hiring that Linux desktop

547
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,200
gaming product manager.

548
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,760
So is that maybe a start in the mobile room?

549
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,040
Diddle Danny points out that maybe one way to look at this

550
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,360
as people have left,

551
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,680
but to what extent have those folks been replaced?

552
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,520
Yeah.

553
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,640
Diddle, do you think it's like a transition period?

554
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,600
Not sure about that.

555
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,600
A lot of the big folks in SnapCraft that have left,

556
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,040
they just have not been replaced at all.

557
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,160
That's interesting.

558
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,560
But they have been hiring in like documentation.

559
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,480
They have been hiring in the desktop space.

560
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,880
What do you think that implies?

561
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,440
I wonder if it's some kind of downgrading

562
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,560
of the importance of snaps.

563
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,160
Minimac, what are your thoughts?

564
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,920
Well, I think it's not really an issue.

565
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,520
Ubuntu has become standard

566
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,840
and standard is not interesting for us Linux geeks,

567
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,680
but still you can do everything you want.

568
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,560
And Ubuntu, they have some license agreements

569
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,800
with computer manufacturers like Lenovo and HP.

570
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,240
They have thousands of installations running

571
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,680
on universities and colleges.

572
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,280
It's just a standard.

573
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,440
And I don't think this is really a problem.

574
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,240
You can do everything with Ubuntu.

575
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,160
I use it until it's started.

576
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,120
So I don't really see an issue.

577
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,720
Brent, do you think we are just

578
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,320
in the red flag stage right now?

579
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,840
Like this is fixable, right?

580
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,560
You know, I started with the red flag situation,

581
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,520
but I think with Minimac,

582
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,640
I just perhaps might suggest a different perspective.

583
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,000
And I wonder, is this just a maturing

584
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,200
of Linux distributions?

585
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,320
You know, is Ubuntu the new Debian?

586
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,440
You know, Debian used to be the kind of boring,

587
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,800
really stable, you can install it

588
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,360
and it would just work for a long time kind of distribution.

589
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,880
And I wonder if Ubuntu sort of is the modern Debian

590
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,280
in that sense, is it just finding a different kind

591
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,120
of title?

592
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,440
I could be totally wrong there.

593
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,680
I'm curious what you think.

594
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,480
I wonder, I feel that if you want to set the standard,

595
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,040
if you wanna create something that developers

596
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,480
are going to embrace and get excited about,

597
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,120
if you want buzz, that kind of stuff,

598
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,360
you can't let your foot off the gas too much.

599
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,800
Otherwise, before you know it,

600
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,440
the whole world's talking about Fedora,

601
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,000
Pop!OS and Manjaro.

602
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,200
Altera, I know I always butcher your handle,

603
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,760
but you have some perspective too.

604
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,840
Well, Ubuntu is like a great product

605
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,720
and like a nice operating system.

606
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,800
But like for the past couple of years,

607
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,600
they fired a lot of people and dropped Unity 8,

608
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,320
which was like most of their desktop projects at the time.

609
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,400
Because up till then, they were like heavily involved

610
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,320
in like creating things in Ubuntu

611
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,960
that were then like trickled out

612
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,960
or get adopted by the upstream projects.

613
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,400
But when they fired a lot of people

614
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,320
and just dropped their main desktop projects,

615
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,160
the rest of the desktop team that was left

616
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,200
was like playing catch-ups and reacting

617
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,560
to what the rest of the ecosystem is doing.

618
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,840
And they like do not have the research now

619
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,800
to develop new desktop things

620
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,120
because the server seems to be like

621
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,960
the only funded space now.

622
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,520
It does make me think of, you know,

623
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,000
us sort of wondering like, well,

624
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,160
are they going to catch up on the latest GNOME stuff?

625
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,800
Yeah, I think what I'm searching for

626
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,400
is I want to want to run Ubuntu.

627
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,520
I want to want to run it.

628
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,760
Like, and I don't.

629
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,800
I, it's just not even really a consideration

630
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,560
when I'm reloading, when I was taking Mint off my ThinkPad,

631
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,800
I thought about Arch for a minute

632
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,040
and I just said, I'm going to stick with Fedora.

633
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,880
And I went back to Fedora.

634
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,840
I think it is especially hard

635
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,400
with how good Fedora has gotten.

636
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,240
And now that that's, I can see it, you know,

637
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,080
if you've always used Ubuntu

638
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,000
and you haven't played with Fedora,

639
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,080
but like, if you know how to make Fedora work well,

640
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,560
which does not take very much these days.

641
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,320
And it's, there's just so much more to be excited

642
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,760
about every release and you get more releases more often.

643
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,720
It's tricky, right?

644
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,480
Because what Fedora has done

645
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,040
is they've shipped the right upstream first,

646
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,680
and then they have put together a really good system

647
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,600
to manage all of it in a really clean modern design

648
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,280
for a Linux system.

649
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,320
And they, you know, Canonical's approach

650
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,240
is much more direct.

651
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,720
It's about creating that Ubuntu desktop experience.

652
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,480
And they think about things like snaps and that,

653
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,880
and it's just a different, it's a different set of goals.

654
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,960
And the problem is, is that I think it's just more noticeable

655
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,200
when they take their foot off the gas.

656
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,320
And I don't know, I'm looking forward to 2204,

657
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,320
you know, and with this bug fix for this Ubuntu pro thing,

658
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,840
where you can say, don't remind me,

659
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,600
and then it doesn't bother you anymore.

660
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,080
That's a nice solution.

661
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,120
And you can still enable it.

662
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,160
If you say, don't remind me,

663
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,280
and then decide to change your mind,

664
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,240
you can go into the software and sources app,

665
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,360
and still turn it back on.

666
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,400
It's available in there.

667
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,160
You know, the recent news

668
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,440
around System76's scheduler stuff,

669
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:35,320
I think that also maybe because System76 has been,

670
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,480
you know, has been stepping up their focus

671
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,280
on their own desktop efforts and are not distracted,

672
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,520
well, distracted's a strong word here,

673
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,160
but you know, do not have a server side

674
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,720
to really dive into.

675
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,920
That also makes, I think adds a contrast.

676
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,920
That's such a great point

677
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,080
because that is definitely putting pressure on this

678
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,120
because, you know, you can disagree

679
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,920
with the direction they're taking Cosmic,

680
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,200
but it's- They're doing something.

681
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,720
Yeah, it's a bold pushing forward,

682
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,560
especially with the scheduler too.

683
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,400
And you see that too,

684
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,840
like I think Manjaro's really good about it.

685
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,160
They have a very good, strong brand there.

686
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,480
Fedora, again, Fedora I think does a great job

687
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,880
of having a very strong experience

688
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,520
and not having to really make something

689
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,880
that deviates very much from upstream.

690
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,960
Like these, they all have a spot there

691
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,080
and where Ubuntu's carved out for themselves,

692
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,240
it just, you can really feel it when they let off.

693
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,120
But I am heartened, I guess, by seeing like signs

694
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,520
that they seem to recognize it to some degree

695
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,320
and they want to address it.

696
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,360
I want to believe that after the Steam Deck was announced,

697
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,920
they had a conversation internal that said,

698
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,440
so why didn't they go with Ubuntu?

699
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,280
Why didn't they use Ubuntu Core on this thing?

700
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,120
I hope so.

701
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,760
Wouldn't that, I mean, isn't that the canonical dream?

702
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,800
Like a device like the Deck using Ubuntu Core,

703
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,040
shipping everything as a snap,

704
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,760
updating Steam as a snap, all of that.

705
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,000
Doesn't it seem perfect?

706
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,160
Yeah, I thought maybe that would work really well.

707
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,680
Yeah, and that's not what they're doing at all.

708
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,000
They're going with Arch.

709
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,280
They're doing it all themselves, their own repos.

710
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,800
They went the most 180.

711
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Arch and Plasma, right?

712
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,400
Yeah, yeah.

713
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,360
So what's that about?

714
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,920
I hope they had a conversation around that.

715
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,440
But I'd like to know your thoughts out there.

716
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,480
Maybe you haven't noticed this.

717
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,120
Maybe you like the change.

718
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:10,820
Maybe you've noticed a transition, but you like it.

719
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,240
Let us know, linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

720
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,000
Linode.com slash unplugged.

721
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,680
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account,

722
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,640
and you go there to support this here show.

723
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,120
Linode's how we've built everything

724
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,480
since we've gone independent.

725
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,720
I really feel like it's my secret weapon,

726
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,160
and I'm still so enthusiastic about Linode

727
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,880
because I just feel like if you knew about it,

728
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,540
you could build something really special, too,

729
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,680
because they've got 11 data centers around the world,

730
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,440
so you can build something close to you.

731
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,520
They have outrageously great performance,

732
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,760
and they have been focused on one thing

733
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,600
since the very beginning, making cloud computing accessible

734
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,800
to everyone and affordable.

735
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,600
That's it, that whole package right there, that concept,

736
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,480
that cloud computing should be easy to use, easy to deploy,

737
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,280
and affordable.

738
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,960
That's like a trifecta of what Linode's all about,

739
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,460
and they've been doing that for 18 years.

740
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,440
Who else do you know who it's really almost 19 years now?

741
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,820
That is some serious focus and dedication,

742
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,560
and that $100 that they're giving you to try it,

743
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,240
that's a confidence thing, right?

744
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,080
That's them saying, you're going to try this,

745
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,440
you're going to actually use it when you have $100,

746
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,520
and we know you're going to like it,

747
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,220
and you're going to stick around.

748
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:21,160
It's great, and they're always investing in performance.

749
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,220
They've just begun rolling out some beautifully fast PCI

750
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,040
MVME storage, so that's something

751
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,740
you might want to think about if you've got an application that

752
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,640
needs some serious IOPS, and their support team

753
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,960
will always work with you to kind of figure that stuff out,

754
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,640
and they're not going to try to get you.

755
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,680
They have great support.

756
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,080
That's what they're known for is their fantastic support.

757
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,080
Well, one of the things they're known for.

758
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,480
I mean, when you do something this good for 18 years,

759
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,080
you get a good reputation.

760
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,880
They've also been a big supporter of the free software

761
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,600
community for a while.

762
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,240
A lot of times, we're doing research on projects,

763
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,800
and we'll come across their GitHub page or their blog,

764
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,760
and right there, they'll have a logo sponsored by Linode.

765
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,360
Some of my favorite projects, like Kubuntu and Linux Fest

766
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,920
Northwest, sponsored by Linode, and of course,

767
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,200
they sponsor a lot of Linux media these days.

768
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,400
That's massive.

769
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,440
And I love where they're going.

770
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,840
I chat with them on the regular, and I get the inside scoop

771
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,920
on what's coming next, and I happen

772
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,680
to know it's something that is going to be really useful.

773
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,040
So if you're a performance hound,

774
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,780
or if you want something that's just simple,

775
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,160
or maybe you're looking to have a hybrid cloud set up

776
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,840
so you don't have every egg in every single hyperscaler

777
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,520
basket out there, I think you know what I'm talking about.

778
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,520
Linode could work great in that scenario, too.

779
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,280
So go get the $100, support the show, try it,

780
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,840
and learn something.

781
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,040
What a great opportunity.

782
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,520
It's linode.com slash unplugged.

783
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:44,120
We got some great feedback this week, as always.

784
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,240
So please continue sending those in, linuxunplugged.com

785
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,480
slash contact.

786
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,720
Micah says, first, I want to tell every Jupyter broadcasting

787
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,400
listener out there something.

788
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,600
If you ever have a chance to go to a JB meetup,

789
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
do yourself a favor and go.

790
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,800
I drove up from Portland for the meetup last Sunday,

791
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,400
and it was a blast.

792
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,960
The JB crew is a warm and welcoming bunch,

793
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,440
and it was great to spend the day

794
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,040
with a group of fellow Linux enthusiasts.

795
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,560
It was like being with old friends

796
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,960
that you've never met before.

797
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,720
I can't wait for the next one.

798
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,680
I completely agree with that.

799
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,680
It's like meeting old friends that you didn't know.

800
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,480
It's a weird thing, because, I mean, you're human.

801
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,800
So you've got about five minutes of like, hey, hi,

802
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,000
my name's so-and-so.

803
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,160
Oh, yeah, OK, how do you do?

804
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:29,880
What do you do?

805
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,040
The initial social anxiety that we all have.

806
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,480
If you can survive that five minutes, after that,

807
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,840
it's like you've been hanging out with these people for 20

808
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,360
years.

809
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,160
And it was such a great group of people

810
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,320
that afterwards, Wes and I were talking to each other like,

811
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,400
it's pretty rad that a group of people that awesome

812
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,840
live in the Pacific Northwest.

813
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,840
We were like, yay, go Pacific Northwest.

814
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,320
No kidding.

815
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,960
I mean, they're all over wherever we have an audience.

816
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah, for sure, yeah.

817
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,640
That some of the awesome audience is around us, wow.

818
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,940
But I would totally hang out with that same group of people

819
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,080
again, and I hope we will.

820
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:08,000
Also, just kind of incredible is listener Jose

821
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,640
made the trip out here.

822
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,600
You may recall Jose also made the trip to Denver,

823
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,240
and he won a Raspberry Pi that Linode gave away.

824
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,720
Jose is visually impaired and lives in Puerto Rico

825
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,280
and made the trip out to Seattle.

826
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,960
Never been to Seattle before, but came out for us.

827
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,080
That's just a highlight.

828
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,680
It's wild.

829
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,360
It was a highlight.

830
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,240
It really was.

831
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,560
And it's inspiring too, and he's a developer by day.

832
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,280
So we can sit down there and just talk shop,

833
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,640
and it's so much fun.

834
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,360
And he's got the perspective of doing it from Puerto Rico, which

835
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,160
is fascinating.

836
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,400
And the whole crew was just great to talk to.

837
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,720
Everybody was in conversation.

838
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,120
There was nobody left out.

839
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,840
Nobody was in the corner being socially awkward.

840
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,760
Everybody clicked.

841
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,880
There was food and cookies for plenty.

842
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,200
I still have food and cookies here.

843
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,320
So I want to do another one in a few months.

844
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,840
Of course, I want to do them on the road, too,

845
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,840
so we can spread these out.

846
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,360
Absolutely.

847
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,720
And one day, I want to fly around the world and do these,

848
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,400
but that's more of a time and budget thing.

849
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,960
We'll get there.

850
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,800
We'll get there.

851
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,240
But I could see doing one in the late spring or something.

852
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,200
I don't know.

853
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,880
I've got to get my juke stuff figured out.

854
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,680
Once I get Lady Jukes figured out,

855
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,140
and I know what I'm doing with that,

856
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,060
then I can start planning the rest of my life.

857
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,720
That old hierarchy of needs.

858
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,200
You're still working on shelter.

859
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,440
You know, if you do a string of meetups

860
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,200
during the winter as a regular thing,

861
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,560
you wouldn't have these rat problems, Chris.

862
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,200
I just keep moving, and they can never find their way in.

863
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,680
That's it.

864
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,320
Although, you know, I'll end up just going somewhere else

865
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,240
that has rats, these damn things.

866
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,040
They're everywhere.

867
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,800
Or you'll find exciting new pests from other regions.

868
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,640
So I know we got some nopics adventures that we were.

869
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,240
We got a lot of nopics adventures,

870
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,260
but I know there was at least one we

871
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,640
wanted to talk about on there.

872
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,080
We got a lot of them, and we've been talking about them,

873
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,000
which is really great.

874
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,360
But we got one from Tristan that I thought would be a really

875
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,560
fun story to tell.

876
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,640
For most of the time my kids were growing up,

877
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,480
I had a semi-profitable side hustle repairing Windows systems.

878
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,080
I wound up doing it often enough to have a nopics terminal

879
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,000
server I could pixie boot.

880
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,880
My daughters would frequently use the nopics pixie boot option

881
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,520
to bypass the network printer restrictions on their school

882
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,800
laptops so they could print their assignments out

883
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,080
at my house.

884
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,680
As many times as those speedy live sessions saved my bacon,

885
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,640
I was asked to meet with her principal

886
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,120
because my daughter had been selling live nopics USB boot

887
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,680
sticks to classmates who were interested in bypassing

888
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,360
the school-issued laptop restrictions for less

889
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,200
academic and savory purposes.

890
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
Wow.

891
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,120
The lesson?

892
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,560
If you find yourself finding back doors into systems

893
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,480
when kids are around, be aware.

894
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,040
They absorb everything, they solve problems quickly,

895
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:44,400
and they don't always wrestle with the moral implications.

896
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,080
Good advice.

897
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,040
That's a good little victory for a kid, too,

898
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,080
when you figure out a bypass like that.

899
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,440
That's not even a thing we got into with the nopics stuff,

900
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,840
but it was also great for all kinds of stuff like that.

901
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,920
A Windows system that was totally locked down,

902
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,560
but the USB ports were there, and you'd just plug in

903
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,160
and just completely bypass it.

904
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,560
Yeah, a lot of people back then would forget to lock down

905
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,000
the bootloader or the BIOS.

906
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,480
Yeah.

907
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,760
Brings back the memories, the member berries.

908
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,080
OK, all right, we have an email from Justin.

909
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,240
Yeah, Justin writes in, it was fun

910
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,120
to hear you guys talk about nopics and the live CD.

911
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,760
A little after the turn of the century,

912
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,560
I was working at Best Buy's tech bench, which

913
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,520
changed to the Geek Squad.

914
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,720
And we had nopics disks laying around.

915
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,840
You ultimately had a ruined Windows install

916
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,280
and needed to rescue data for the customer.

917
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,480
Nopics was an invaluable tool that

918
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,960
saved countless people's family photos and documents.

919
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,640
Yeah, that's a great point right there.

920
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,960
I mean, I think it was one of the earlier times

921
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,760
where you had access to that amazing recovery environment.

922
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,600
Yeah, and the fact that you could boot up in Linux,

923
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,280
mount the Windows partition, and then

924
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,200
use the network or another removable disk

925
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,520
to save the data.

926
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,400
Especially compared to having to boot into a Windows installer

927
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,560
recovery environment, which is so limited in comparison.

928
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,200
It's just no good, no good at all.

929
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,640
It also made me think a little higher of Best Buy repair

930
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,800
people, I don't know.

931
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,600
Maybe it's just me and I'm fixing my own stuff at home,

932
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,920
but I never really knew what they did behind that desk,

933
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,480
and now I know a little bit more.

934
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,080
Well, they have to deal with the public,

935
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,400
so you got to respect them for that at least.

936
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,240
Yeah, there's that.

937
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,760
They have to deal with, and people are not happy

938
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,160
when their machines break, and they probably often.

939
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,440
Especially when they broke them.

940
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,160
If they buy them from Best Buy, they probably

941
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,680
come in there expecting Best Buy to fix them for free, too.

942
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,200
So I could see them being just little turds about that.

943
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,960
So they probably have to deal with a lot,

944
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,920
so mad respect actually to them.

945
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,600
Fair enough.

946
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,800
The fact that, you know.

947
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,260
It's like helping your family, but you

948
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,420
don't love these strangers.

949
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,520
There's probably a few bad ones.

950
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,000
It's not the whole batch.

951
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,680
Axel wrote in from Sweden as well.

952
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,000
He said, I know a live USB stick can save a PC,

953
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,080
but has it ever saved your phone?

954
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,920
A couple of years ago, my dad lost his phone

955
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,240
in my parents' house, and it was impossible to find.

956
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,320
For some reason, the Find My Android alarm didn't work,

957
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,560
but I could see that it was connected to the Wi-Fi

958
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,640
somewhere.

959
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,520
The battery was draining, and time was ticking.

960
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,640
Turns out you can measure the Wi-Fi signal strength

961
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,800
to other devices in Kismet.

962
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,240
Now, this is Brent speaking.

963
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,240
I've never used Kismet.

964
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,840
Has one of you guys used Kismet?

965
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,560
I don't know if I've used it specifically,

966
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,200
but I've used a tool similar to Kismet.

967
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,560
And it is really amazing what's going on

968
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,760
in the wireless spectrum when you start looking at it.

969
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,680
Have you ever looked at any of these Wi-Fi analyzer tools?

970
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,480
Oh, yeah.

971
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:26,980
Yeah.

972
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,960
Wi-Fi analyzer is the classic app.

973
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,840
I think I have used Kismet now and again,

974
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,440
but it's been a few years since I had the whole Aircrack

975
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,380
and the whole suite of tools for pulling around

976
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,000
with this stuff.

977
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,500
Oh, yeah.

978
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:42,060
Back in the day, I definitely had a specific wireless card

979
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,400
that I could put into, I think they called it promiscuous mode,

980
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,280
but I can't remember.

981
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,520
Some mode you put it into, promiscuous card.

982
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,200
Yeah, you were already in that mode, but separate story.

983
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,840
Hey-o, that's true.

984
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,400
But I remember getting a specific card,

985
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,840
and it worked with very specific software.

986
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,840
And you could do all kinds of things back then.

987
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,640
I mean, Wi-Fi is in a much better shape

988
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,760
than it was a decade ago.

989
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,940
Sounds like at least, according to this page,

990
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,760
Kismet now works to some degree under WSL.

991
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
So how about that?

992
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,960
That's just great.

993
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,520
So I actually said, it was actually too hard for me

994
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,200
to install at the time, which it sounds like these days

995
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,640
is much easier.

996
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,680
He continues, so I booted up a Kali Linux USB stick

997
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,840
and walk around with my laptop until the signal was

998
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,760
at its strongest.

999
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,560
Turns out the phone was directly below me in the basement.

1000
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,200
I finally found it laying on a sponge.

1001
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,480
That is so great.

1002
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,120
What a great way to find your phone.

1003
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,960
Yeah.

1004
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,960
That's a USB little like, that's what

1005
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,040
I was saying last week, too.

1006
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,460
It's like, just keep a few of these with you at all times.

1007
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,200
You never know what problems you can solve.

1008
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,760
And he did it without a tile tracker thing or whatever.

1009
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,120
Look at him go.

1010
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,440
Air Snort was the app.

1011
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,760
Yeah, Diddle and Gerald got it right.

1012
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,080
Air Snort and Air Snort NG eventually.

1013
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,520
Wow, you got to have an NG.

1014
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,400
Oh, great.

1015
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,720
Well, that really was, those were all hitting the memories.

1016
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,560
LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact if you've

1017
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,760
got something you want to mention, an idea for the show,

1018
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,440
or a response to something we talked about.

1019
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,400
A few things to tell you about here in the housekeeping

1020
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:15,960
section.

1021
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,520
First of all, thank you to our members.

1022
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,320
We do only have one sponsor right now,

1023
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,160
and so the members are keeping us going.

1024
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,040
Like, it's literally that.

1025
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,080
So thank you to our members, UnpluggedCore.com.

1026
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,040
And if you want to support the entire network,

1027
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,200
get all of the shows ad-free, you can go to jupyter.party.

1028
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,760
But we do also have that live version.

1029
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,280
That's actually what makes it in the jupyter.party feed.

1030
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,560
That's where you get to hear Wes cursing and.

1031
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,680
It happens, folks.

1032
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,520
Talking about food, I don't know, random stuff.

1033
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,800
Really, we just have two shows.

1034
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,100
We actually, I mean, we're geeks.

1035
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,560
We talk about geeky stuff.

1036
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,040
That's what happens every single time.

1037
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,800
You get all of that when you become a member.

1038
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,960
So that's at UnpluggedCore.com or the whole network

1039
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,920
at jupyter.party.

1040
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,200
Also, I want to tell you about our matrix community.

1041
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,940
It's growing.

1042
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:00,600
And one of the things that people say about Telegram

1043
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,560
is it's nice for your phone, but it's just one thread.

1044
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,080
So there's all kinds of conversations going on.

1045
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,040
Well, that's awesome.

1046
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,680
And a lot of our hosts pop in there

1047
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,560
throughout the week at jupyterbroadcasting.com

1048
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,280
slash telegram.

1049
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,720
Our matrix community, that's been separated out

1050
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,280
into topics and shows.

1051
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,560
And so things stay on topic and in the individual rooms.

1052
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
And it's pretty great.

1053
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,640
It's where we also have our JB cryptocurrency

1054
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,480
chat going on, where we have rational,

1055
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,800
reasonable conversations.

1056
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,360
And Wes is always trying to sell his NFTs.

1057
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,560
I was going to say, at least until Chris shows up.

1058
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,440
Zing, dude, zing.

1059
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,840
So that's at linuxunplugged.com slash matrix

1060
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,720
for information about that.

1061
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,400
Our mumble room for information about that

1062
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,520
is at linuxunplugged.com slash mumble.

1063
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,560
And they were in there this Sunday,

1064
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,740
chatting before we even got started.

1065
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,580
So reliable.

1066
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,400
And we loved it.

1067
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,240
That's great.

1068
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,920
It's like a slice of the experience of the meetup thing,

1069
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,480
because you get like-minded folks

1070
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,760
who are informed about this stuff and want to learn.

1071
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,480
Hit new folks, regulars, a great mix.

1072
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,360
So that's pretty nice.

1073
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:06,600
So details for our mumble, linuxunplugged.com slash mumble.

1074
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,840
Love to have you there.

1075
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,960
Now, we do have a very special pick.

1076
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,840
We wanted to work it into the show this week,

1077
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,720
because it's important, but it didn't

1078
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,920
fit with the overall theme.

1079
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,280
So we're making a pick out of it.

1080
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,840
I'm just being honest with you.

1081
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,200
Slackware 15.0 officially released this week.

1082
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,160
It ships with Linux 5.15, which is the LTS kernel.

1083
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,820
Probably pretty appropriate.

1084
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,640
And I got to say, their release page is really a work of art.

1085
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,440
It is a time capsule in of itself.

1086
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,080
It's worth looking at just for that.

1087
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,760
I love that it starts with breaking news.

1088
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,880
Semaca, Minnesota.

1089
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,040
Good for them.

1090
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,600
And this release is also associated with some losses,

1091
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,920
people close to the project from the last couple of years.

1092
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,680
And it made me really appreciate the fact

1093
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,720
that Patrick is still around, Slackware is still around,

1094
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,600
because some OGs in that project were lost recently.

1095
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,000
And that's going to be a thing that happens more and more

1096
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,160
as part of our community ages a bit.

1097
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,920
And I'm grateful that we still are getting releases of Slackware

1098
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,000
after all these years.

1099
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,040
I mean, this one looks like a good one, too.

1100
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,200
There's some modern stuff in here that brought in Rust

1101
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,240
and Python 3.

1102
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,280
There's Pipewire and Wayland support.

1103
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,440
Did you say Rust?

1104
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,520
I sure did.

1105
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,320
Yeah, and it looks like you can get 5.16 if you

1106
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,200
want to go for it and get really the latest stuff.

1107
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,160
And Sendmail, it's been moved and the way

1108
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,640
has been made for Postfix.

1109
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,120
Yeah, all right.

1110
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,120
That's a big transition.

1111
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,600
Yeah, wow.

1112
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,120
About time, I'd say.

1113
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,080
We joke, but actually we have a lot of respect for Slackware,

1114
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,480
Patrick, and the entire project.

1115
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,600
And we appreciate that release, so go check it out.

1116
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,400
We'll have a link in the show notes.

1117
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,040
But we do have one more thing to get into.

1118
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,480
This came up in the Mumble Room before we started.

1119
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,900
It's something that Grubb's been capable of for a long time.

1120
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,200
I didn't know about it.

1121
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,400
And I got to acknowledge that because if I did know about it,

1122
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,800
I would have told you guys immediately.

1123
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,680
But this week, we're going to link you

1124
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,240
to something that's going to take your Grubb bootloader

1125
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,680
to the next level.

1126
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,960
You can really crank it to 11 with Grubb Tunes.

1127
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,800
And we have a website that Wes has found

1128
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,320
that lets you test out the tunes that

1129
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,440
will play when Grubb loads.

1130
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,240
Give us an example there, Wes.

1131
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,360
I mean, how amazing is that, right?

1132
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,560
Your computer boots up, and right before the Grubb menu

1133
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:37,720
pops up on your screen, right through the PC speaker.

1134
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,120
Like, who doesn't want that blasting in their PC speaker?

1135
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,520
Now, we should note that this is all early boot time.

1136
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,120
Grubb's not going to really work multi-threaded here,

1137
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,720
so you do have to wait for the whole tune

1138
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,720
to play before booting continues.

1139
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,520
So maybe choose the short one.

1140
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,440
Yeah, like just a coin or something like that.

1141
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,360
I mean, and keep in mind, it is going

1142
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,760
to play through your PC speaker.

1143
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,240
So that's also something.

1144
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,240
See, that's perfect, right?

1145
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,360
So this website that we're linking to,

1146
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,280
it lets you test these out before you actually

1147
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:08,760
commit them.

1148
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,080
Yeah, Grubb Init Tune Tester, because it's basically,

1149
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,720
let's see, the format is tempo, and then you

1150
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,600
have a series of frequency and duration.

1151
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,840
So you're actually specifying what frequency the speaker

1152
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,280
to play, and then for how long.

1153
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,920
So it's a little unintuitive.

1154
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,720
You might want to be able to test this faster

1155
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,200
than having to reboot or use a VM.

1156
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,080
Hey, we got a newbie.

1157
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,520
We got newbies in the chat room.

1158
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,760
We do this show live on Sundays now.

1159
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,120
We start at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

1160
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,840
And it's a lot of fun to have you guys in the Mumble Room,

1161
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,240
even if you're just in the quiet listening or in the chat room.

1162
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,720
It gives us a special kind of energy.

1163
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,520
It gets us going.

1164
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,200
It's exciting.

1165
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,560
And you also get to help us title the show,

1166
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,360
and you get a lot more show as well.

1167
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,640
So we do that at jblive.tv on a Sunday.

1168
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,180
And of course, we always appreciate

1169
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,360
you just downloading and listening.

1170
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,240
Maybe you've always just got it via the podcast,

1171
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,080
and that's what works for you.

1172
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,080
Well, you're about 99% of the audience, maybe even 99.8.

1173
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,760
So we understand, and we appreciate you too.

1174
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,480
In fact, if I could add one more podcast,

1175
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,320
I mean, there's a whole bunch of good shows

1176
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,720
at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

1177
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,360
Yeah, how are you going to pick just one?

1178
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,040
In fact, like Coder Radio and Self Hosted,

1179
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,360
I think they are do not misses.

1180
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,680
But speaking specifically to the Linux audience,

1181
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,840
you got to go get Linux Action News.

1182
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,680
Nice and tight, just what you need to know,

1183
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,880
broken down in a way that's easily to understand,

1184
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,520
gets you right through it without the hype,

1185
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,520
linuxactionnews.com.

1186
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,520
It's like a whole other aspect of the show.

1187
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,440
We filter the fluff so you don't have to.

1188
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,240
We look back at Linux Action Show and thought,

1189
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,800
let's take the news segment and just really hone that in,

1190
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,840
and just give you the stuff that matters.

1191
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,780
And so you can get that at Linux Action News.

1192
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,620
Go get that.

1193
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,520
Otherwise, we just appreciate you joining us.

1194
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,840
Show comes out now late Sundays, Pacific time,

1195
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,360
early Mondays for most of the world.

1196
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,180
Who can keep track?

1197
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,020
Just subscribe.

1198
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,160
There's like an automated feed.

1199
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,400
That's what I would do.

1200
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,240
Yeah.

1201
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,120
Don't let the machine handle it.

1202
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,280
And don't forget, go get a new podcast app,

1203
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,960
newpodcastapps.com, and then send us a boost.

1204
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,920
We're watching your boost-a-grams,

1205
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,000
highlight of our day when one of those comes in.

1206
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,240
And if you don't know what I'm talking about,

1207
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,520
go check out newpodcastapps.com.

1208
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,280
There's a whole new index out there.

1209
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,800
Of course, you can also subscribe directly

1210
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,440
at linuxunplug.com slash subscribe.

1211
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,680
That's where we have all the feeds.

1212
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,000
Or just download the MP3 and play it with VLC

1213
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,120
like I do sometimes, you animal.

1214
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,320
Thanks so much for joining us.

1215
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,160
See you next week.

1216
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:54,980
Where are you?

1217
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:08,780
All right, JBtitles.com, let's go pick our title and boat this thing.

1218
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,400
We got to give it a good name.

1219
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,680
You know, I wanted to mention the absolute highlight of my week, change my day sometimes

1220
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,460
is when one of these boosts comes in and they're often just like, you know, just a small amount

1221
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:24,680
of stats, but to get the live messages and to know the episode that people are listening

1222
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,160
to at the time, it's information I never knew I wanted.

1223
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,960
Something about the real time nature of these coming in with the show name on there and

1224
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,480
the little noise that Helipad makes when they come in, it's a delight.

1225
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:42,520
And what I think for these kind of value for value payments to really work, we need to

1226
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,640
be able to embed a button on the website.

1227
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,720
Developers need to be able to have a button like in their about page, like a link that

1228
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,720
you click.

1229
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,200
Yeah, you want it low friction.

1230
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,540
Yeah, because I think we could take this beyond just podcasts, but it needs to be outside

1231
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:59,400
just the podcast apps and a little bit like sending a message.

1232
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:05,960
I just I thanked a developer for building a basically a Python bot and I sent him some

1233
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,880
Litecoin, but he didn't, you know, when you just send somebody Litecoin, you don't know

1234
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,840
who it's from.

1235
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,840
Some coins that show up.

1236
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,840
Yeah.

1237
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,840
So then I had to like track down his contact page.

1238
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,760
I was like, hey, just so you know, I sent this in just because I really appreciate you

1239
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,920
working hard on this and like it just would be so nice if it was just one button and it

1240
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,840
just does it all and puts a message in there and sends it and they get it in real time.

1241
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,080
It's the greatest thing.

1242
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,080
It's the future.

1243
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,080
It's the way of the future.

1244
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,520
I have a question, a follow up question for you, Chris.

1245
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,520
Sure.

1246
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,400
What would it take for you to be interested in installing Ubuntu on your laptop?

1247
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,400
Hmm.

1248
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,760
Well, probably the latest Gnome stack and that includes like the latest GTK four and

1249
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,560
all of that, or, you know, have them go wild with a plasma.

1250
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:55,840
I mean, that, I mean, obviously I would immediately try that without question, but I think, uh,

1251
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,520
just really something, something like that, something that probably address, they could

1252
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,580
somehow address software availability a little bit more than just snaps and app packages.

1253
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,640
They probably need to redo the software center too.

1254
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,880
Like there's a few things in there.

1255
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,080
I'd love to have butter a fast support in the installer.

1256
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,080
I mean, it's not mandatory.

1257
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,720
And I, you know, ZFS for my data storage is fine.

1258
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,720
What about you?

1259
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,840
Can you, am I missing anything you can think of?

1260
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,200
I do like trying out the ZFS support of the installer from time to time, but I'm curious

1261
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:25,200
to see what happens with like some of their new flutter work.

1262
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,920
That's not enough to like keep me on a desktop necessarily.

1263
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,920
Not yet.

1264
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:29,920
You know, that's something we didn't touch on in the show.

1265
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,600
So I'm glad you brought this up, right?

1266
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:36,600
Is there are rumors of like a flutter desktop one day from Canonical.

1267
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,680
That's one of the rumors out there right now and that's something else I would immediately

1268
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,060
try with alpha labels or whatever, I would immediately try that.

1269
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:49,840
So it's just pushing the envelope forward a little bit, bringing something that, you

1270
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:55,440
know, cause one message that we've heard from a couple of developers now, and it really,

1271
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,040
I think came clear in the Lutris developer interview that we did is there was a period

1272
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,860
of time in desktop Linux where Ubuntu was setting the pace and so if Canonical built

1273
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:11,480
an app in a stack, then other people used that stack and it wasn't universally true.

1274
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,480
I'm not trying to imply like that was 100, that would never happen, but we've heard it

1275
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,120
from several different developers and I think the Lutris one was the most clear about it.

1276
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,600
Like they were taking Canonical's lead.

1277
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,800
And so then when Canonical stopped leading, they don't really know what to go to or where

1278
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,680
to go to next.

1279
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,200
And so I could see that being true for some developers.

1280
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,640
I don't think it's as necessary anymore.

1281
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:37,200
I think, I actually, I really think the whole GNOME GTK flat pack stack is really kind of

1282
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:38,560
starting to come together.

1283
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:42,280
So it may be less and less of an issue, that kind of thing going forward.

1284
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,400
But it really was, it was something that resonated with me is that there was a time where that

1285
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,400
was really true.

1286
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,400
And if they were going to do something like that with a Flutter desktop or they maybe

1287
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:55,000
ever tried like an experimental version where they basically made an official Kubuntu version.

1288
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Oh.

1289
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Yeah.

1290
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,480
Cause it's not, cause you can't, so for some reason just using Kubuntu doesn't do it.

1291
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,800
Kubuntu is great.

1292
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,480
We've got it right here next to me.

1293
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,560
It's running on the OBS machine.

1294
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:10,060
Totally been a rock, but it's also something about the underlying system and maybe it's

1295
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,060
the fact that it's Debian.

1296
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:15,760
Cause I also, I'm not particularly drawn to Debian, even though I think it's a great distribution.

1297
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,260
I've used it on servers.

1298
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,260
We use it.

1299
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,600
I think it's totally viable.

1300
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,040
I think I'm just, I want to be done with apt.

1301
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,040
That's part of it.

1302
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,040
Hmm.

1303
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,040
That could be part of it.

1304
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,040
Yeah.

1305
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,040
Not that it's, I mean, it works fine.

1306
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,040
It works fine.

1307
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,040
I just.

1308
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,040
It's feeling a little old.

1309
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:35,240
I wonder if this is a personal observation, but I wonder if there's something to be said

1310
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:40,080
for the lack of in-person canonical sprints.

1311
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:45,160
I know they were doing those very often and in many parts of the world for their team

1312
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:49,000
and for obvious reasons, those have haven't happened in the last, I don't know, a couple

1313
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,280
of years.

1314
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:56,160
I wonder if there's a correlation there to their innovation internally versus those kind

1315
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,160
of in-person sprints.

1316
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,960
There's got to be something to that, right?

1317
00:48:58,960 --> 00:48:59,960
I'll blame that.

1318
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,240
I mean, I don't think so, but I'll blame that.

1319
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,240
I like that.

1320
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,240
It at least doesn't help.

1321
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,760
I mean, if you could blame it on COVID, that's the best way to go.

1322
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,760
I think.

1323
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,720
Well, it's just, I know you, you know, I, I just came from a trip to the studio and

1324
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,760
how much should we get done while I was there versus, you know, our typical pace with.

1325
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,760
That's true.

1326
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,480
I mean, it was 80% remodels, but.

1327
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,480
That's true.

1328
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,480
Still.

1329
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,560
And you know, I've, I've been to a couple of those sprints and they really do just get

1330
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,560
a lot done.

1331
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:28,280
They all sit down in these different rooms and yeah, there might be something.

1332
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,280
Maybe you are onto something Brent.

1333
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:59,880
It's not one singular thing, but maybe that's a contributor.
