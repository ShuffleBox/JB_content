1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,980
Actually, no, I do remember Chris. Are you wearing your usual lumberjack shirt? No, I watched two live episodes

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,200
Got some great swag, but I can't wear it because it's green

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,840
The new jacket which I gotta say so wimpy sent me a

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,560
buntaise

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,880
Fancy with his auntie. Yeah, he's going custom design and

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,180
And the shirts are green like I would just be invisible in the studio

7
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:37,980
Which is kind of cool, but the jacket's black with a green logo like you know where the Star Trek comb badge would be obviously right

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,300
And so kind of looks like I have a Star Trek comb badge actually because it's kind of like

9
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,780
Well, I left it at home because the girlfriend loves the new jacket

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,460
She wanted me to personally thank wimpy because she thinks it's very well

11
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,780
I can't remember the word she used but she likes it. That's great

12
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:59,740
Yeah, likes it on you or likes it for herself. No, well no likes it on me. She likes she thought I was yeah

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,800
She thought was a good fit. Well, you're welcome Chris. Yeah. Thank you

14
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:10,420
That's what I'm saying now, of course the I do have that one of the shirts upstairs here, but otherwise it's all at home is

15
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,660
It took a little while because it came from where did it come from?

16
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:20,660
This is a good question a part of Europe that I can't even remember the name. Yeah, I remember looking at I'm going

17
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,140
What what is what did I get from? Oh, this must be

18
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
Yeah, yeah

19
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,420
Yeah, so the guy the guy the guy that runs this place Gabor. His name is it's brilliant

20
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,740
So it's a hello tux and they do

21
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,620
official

22
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,140
Linux

23
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,140
merchandise for a number of projects

24
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:44,300
and they originally started up as like a part-time endeavor and

25
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,100
it was they've got a

26
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,940
Computer system that you can fit, you know make designs effectively using Inkscape

27
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,980
Feed that into this stitching machine and then it embroidered as you know

28
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:04,540
These designs and originally that was all running on Windows and he reverse engineered the whole thing

29
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,900
To get it all to run under Linux

30
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,980
That is great. Yeah, and I think just recently like within the last nine months or so

31
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:20,060
He he is actually doing hello tux and these things as a full-time

32
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,460
Occupation now, but he gives back a rather hefty slice

33
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:32,820
To each of the projects. So, you know Debbie and are on there and open suzer and you know countless other things

34
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:40,220
And every time somebody buys one of the items from there, those projects get a kickback from the items

35
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:43,180
He sells so I like I like his you know

36
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,060
his

37
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,900
Business model and did you get a memory stick in amongst all those that was the slickest thing?

38
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,940
That is one of the smallest tiny neatest looking branded. I mean, it's I

39
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:02,180
It's like pinky size. It's upstairs. I should grab it. I will I'll grab it before we start the show. I really like those

40
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,220
Yeah, that is slick like I would buy that like if you were if this is back in the day where we had software on

41
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,220
Shelfs and stores right and I would go down to the computer store and I would buy it some new software

42
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,060
This would be like that like minimum price for that $40. It looks like a $40 like wow

43
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,940
It's a hike. It's a high-class like if I ever know why you're buying that

44
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,940
Much pain that much for these kind of things. No, I know I know that's crazy, but I get I take your meeting. Yeah, I got

45
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,340
Look at the guy. He's like I almost wish I had to reload

46
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,180
I just would love to see this in the side of the Apollo. It's because it's a metal nice-looking thumbstick. Yeah

47
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:40,060
Yeah, and those those you get free if you order like two of these things you get the the USB stick for free or you

48
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,860
Can order it, you know independently as well. So yeah, he's he's a good guy. It's amazing

49
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,860
What's the site for people to check out? Hello tux.com. Let me just

50
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,860
I'll go there right now

51
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,860
This is Linux unplugged episode 135 for March 8th

52
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,860
2016

53
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:06,860
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's hunkered down in its secure enclave and celebrating International Women's Day

54
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,860
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Well, hello there, Wes. Good to have you here, sir

55
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,860
Oh, yes, it's a beautiful bunker. I think

56
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,860
It's a beautiful bunker

57
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,860
It's a beautiful bunker

58
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,860
It's a beautiful bunker

59
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,860
It's a beautiful bunker

60
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,860
It's a beautiful bunker

61
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,860
It's a beautiful bunker

62
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,860
It's a beautiful bunker

63
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,620
Oh, yes, it's a beautiful bunker. Thank you. It's a nice enclave, right? It sure is

64
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:31,860
Yeah

65
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,420
well

66
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:38,740
Broadcasting from today's enclave is a great show coming up in today's episode a brand new version of own cloud and it may

67
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:45,860
Dress some serious concerns I've had and also open up the door for those of us on a VPS that maybe doesn't have enough storage

68
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,060
At the moment super excited about some of the improvements in own cloud 9 including their code sign

69
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,860
And we're gonna be talking about that then later on in the show. It's a big topic. It's a huge topic

70
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,940
You've probably heard me talk about it already if you cause more recent shows

71
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,440
We've got to get the virtual lugs take on Microsoft announcing sequel server for Linux

72
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,580
That's melting my my whole head

73
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,380
what my whole head is melted by this as somebody who used to I

74
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,340
used to have to deploy sequel servers and the whole like

75
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,660
Lock-in that sequel server used to bring to an organization was unprecedented. So to have that ship for Linux melts my head

76
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,860
We're gonna talk about I'm curious to get your take on it too and then

77
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:28,260
Later on in the show towards the end of the show there is an application for the Linux desktop focused on the Linux desktop

78
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:35,820
That promises to seamlessly and transparently deliver Android applications today on your Linux desktop experience

79
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,740
And I'm talking like you go to your launcher you type in the name of the application hit enter boom that Android app is

80
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,580
Up and running on your Linux desktop

81
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:48,300
Wes and I have it loaded here in studio. We've thrown a few apps at it. We're gonna get your take and

82
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,540
And before we do all that we have like a whole bunch of project updates to get into whoa

83
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,220
I know it's so much show. I talked to the whole opening music. That's how much show it is. Holy smoke

84
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,580
So why don't we start by just talking about this beer super quick?

85
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,100
Wes you brought you brought us something special today

86
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:11,060
You brought us a lady for International Women's Day from Nineski Brewing Company. Ninkasi. Nineski Brewing Company

87
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,580
Ninkasi? Ninkasi. Ninkasi

88
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:20,500
Brewing Company. Yeah, I got that part right. Heyo! That's two-thirds Chris. Dawn of the red IPA

89
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,940
It is over on the beer advocate getting an 87 score, which is pretty darn good

90
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:32,540
It's pretty darn good. It says very good there. Yeah, pretty darn good rocking in at a seven point zero zero percent ABV

91
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,180
It's got it's got a whole lot going on with this beer. It really does, it's complex. Yeah, when you drink this thing

92
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,100
There is a freshness that is happening in your mouth. I feel like it's I feel like when I drink this thing

93
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,700
Would you say it's bursting with tropical notes Chris? Is that actually on the bottle?

94
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,460
That is exactly what I would say. I would say it burst the last year of

95
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,660
Layers of skin and sediment on my tongue right off my tongue when I put this in my mouth

96
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,740
Perfect kind of thing for doing a podcast. Exactly. Clears up the mouth. Alright before we get into our project updates

97
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,620
Let's bring in our virtual lug time appropriate greetings mumble room

98
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:13,020
Yes, of course, so I got I got a secret I'm very excited

99
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:21,500
I'm planning to pick myself up something in the near term new toy. Yeah, I I hate using the term toy

100
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:27,860
I hate calling it a toy new business item. Yeah, well because in my estimation it is legitimately

101
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,900
I'm comparing these different solutions. I mean I go legitimately I'm curious

102
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:37,820
I've been hankering for a really good Cody box and a really good plex box. Yeah, really good Netflix box

103
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,380
I wanted to do all of these things and then if you can throw in some YouTube and maybe a Hulu app

104
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,580
Now you're really getting my attention

105
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,500
But I you know

106
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,700
I don't I don't I don't really want a lot of the different options that are out there and I don't want to build a box

107
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:56,420
Really? I don't really want to use Raspberry Pi 3 because or 2 because you know, I want Netflix and whatnot. Mm-hmm

108
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:02,700
So I've been thinking about Cody but thinking about Cody I'm gonna tell you what up my solution is very curious first

109
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,660
I'm gonna just talk a little bit about the new Cody release that I'm getting pretty excited about

110
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,420
So version like 17 or some crap like that. I'll give you the exact number here in a second

111
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:16,140
Coming out real soon and they got a brand new look you guys a brand new look today with is a new milestone

112
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:20,900
They say a sanctuary. I think is how you say this one West. What do you think estuary estuary estuary?

113
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,900
I like in sanctuary estuary

114
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,660
And it's a brand new look it's pretty cool. You'll see that

115
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,020
It's got the main new eye catcher is a whole new home screen

116
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,060
Which will guide you through all of the main sections that are available

117
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:37,620
They've added some useful widgets for movies and TV shows like random and recently added in progress

118
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,860
Actually sounds a lot like it's been inspired from Plex unplayed. Most played are also available. Look at this UI

119
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,180
It's looking pretty good. They're calling this said they're calling this there

120
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,220
What's cool about this is this is also gonna be something that will make available for touch interfaces with a slight

121
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,220
Reface retouch of the UI

122
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,700
Enter the library you're gonna notice new views have received some facelifts developers tried to keep functionality information and balance

123
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:03,820
I think I think it does look pretty nice. It does look pretty nice and the one thing they also say

124
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,820
They've enabled themes in the default or colors in the default theme

125
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,900
So you can have a whole bunch of different colors now in the default theme which is which is new

126
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,300
Here's where I'm going with this West

127
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:19,860
Starting in version 17 encrypt on you're gonna be able to use this this nice-looking. I think it looks better than Plex

128
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,340
It's got you know all the plugins and features of Kodi plus if you don't like this look

129
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,340
There's a bunch of other games you can apply. Yes

130
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,860
So I've been thinking what would be the ultimate box and I mean I have a special requirement is I wanted to be able to

131
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,180
Run Kodi. I want to build a run Plex and I want to be able to do it

132
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,820
I want to build a run Plex offline if possible

133
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,380
Mmm, because when I'm going down the road and I got three monsters strapped to seatbelts behind me

134
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,980
I it is yeah, it is a road safety

135
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,660
Imperative that I can have inside out or frozen playing on the television

136
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,400
I mean it saves lives literally because otherwise it's dad. Can I have this dad? He did this dad?

137
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,820
I want this the whole drive Wes. Okay, do you understand what I'm saying? I understand so I

138
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:08,140
Think I'm looking at the Nvidia shield TV. Whoa. Yeah, I did not expect that. Yeah, I didn't think you would yeah

139
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,820
Tell me more about it. Well the Nvidia shield TV, you know, yeah, it's got good performance

140
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:17,180
You can run all of these applications. It's actually got the newer version of Google's

141
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,540
Television OS on there. That's not their first attempt at it

142
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,300
and

143
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,920
All of the apps we love available for it crazy great performance

144
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,100
Think I do 4k video nice. Yeah

145
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,620
I'm wondering right on the website says Cody. Yeah, I'm waiting likes. Mm-hmm

146
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,780
Yeah, they've tout all the different apps it runs you do you pair that up with something with Cody

147
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,020
So my thinking is wait till that thing drops in price a little bit

148
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,700
I'm gonna jump on that thing and that's gonna be my home entertainment setup. What's it? What's the cost now?

149
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,940
Well, it depends on which one you want

150
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,700
See, I need offline storage and I don't know what the you can get one with up to a 300 gigabyte hard drive

151
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,700
But the price starts to get to $300

152
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,460
So that's a little expensive, but I need the office so I'm gonna wait or maybe I can see if I can add my own

153
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:00,340
Storage, but I'm just thinking Nvidia shield TV with Cody is a super sweet

154
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,540
Low-power quiet combo. Yep. It could be a good way to go

155
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,740
I bet there's probably a lot of other boxes anybody the mumble room just waiting to shout out like Chris

156
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,220
There's this Cody box. It's so great. You can just get it right now

157
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,780
You'd know of one

158
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,380
I've heard a few

159
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,520
There's a there's some like some

160
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,740
Some Android sticks that are on Amazon. They could get for pretty cheap that accomplished the same fundamental thing

161
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:29,620
So you can still use Cody and you know Plex and Android apps so you can get the same experience

162
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,380
But it's not gonna be like for you. I don't know if I want to stick

163
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,260
You know, I don't know if I want to stick because the thing is is I want I want this is over sticks

164
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,260
I

165
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:47,820
Am over sticks because I just I want this thing to be as fast as possible. I I do not ever want time

166
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:52,580
I just I I want it to feel like it's right on the metal and I

167
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,140
for me, it's worth it like big-ass

168
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,540
MKV files and

169
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,220
HD streams and video games like it's all worth it for me to have

170
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:09,560
If the sticks they're just they're just as low-end as possible. I know I know I know speaking of sticks though

171
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,500
You know who is into the sticks?

172
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:17,940
Mozilla on March 1st, Mozilla senior vice president for connected devices announced that the open source organization

173
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:24,780
Seeks to develop test and evaluate for Internet of Things software projects. That's coming from Mozilla

174
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,700
project link project sensor web project smart home and project

175
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,620
What do you think West Vanny VAA and I Vanini?

176
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,820
mumble room anybody VAA and I anyways

177
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,640
They got it was funny, but yeah, okay

178
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,940
The announcement didn't really mention anything about Firefox OS at all

179
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:51,520
But it's probably a safe bet that these things have it there. It's probably a safe bet

180
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,820
It would use these things West my reaction and then this is just me being an out-of-touch Chrome user

181
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,020
my reaction when I hear this is

182
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,860
a

183
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,220
What

184
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,140
What Mozilla is doing what?

185
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:09,460
Why what I mean I what I don't understand is how does this make Firefox a better web browser?

186
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:15,420
Is this a super old way a limited way of thinking? Yes. I mean, I guess we'll see

187
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,760
I think Mozilla has been trying to pivot to something like this or at least explore for quite some time, but

188
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,820
There hasn't been a lot delivered. So I don't know. I'm curious to see what it would look like

189
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,700
I believe that Mozilla has the best intentions or at least very good intentions

190
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
But I don't know what this will really look like

191
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,740
It does seem separate though from them also having a pretty good browser

192
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:45,860
Their announcement about the Firefox OS not doing phones anymore. They yeah, they did say they're gonna do internet of things stuff

193
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,620
They're gonna do tablets and stuff like that. So it kind of goes in with that

194
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:56,460
But I mean if they as a Firefox fanboy, I also don't care if they can make pretty good standard supporting web

195
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:04,180
Focused internet of things maybe even secure devices then I would support that but I guess it really remains to be seen if that's what

196
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,260
they do

197
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,260
when they if they bring in the new

198
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,580
Engine their runtime engine. Oh, come on, dude. Yeah. No, you're just trying to get me upset

199
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:21,440
You're just trying to upset me right now. Stop it Rod and you are trolling me. That's good move, but I'm not falling for it

200
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:28,180
It's just around the corner, right? It's just gonna be yeah. Yeah. Yeah, could it be the next one? Of course

201
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,180
So let's start booby

202
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,500
I think you and I have talked about maybe it was on tech talk today before

203
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:36,820
Maybe was a Kickstarter of the week hadn't we talked about how we thought if there was gonna be a

204
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,140
IOT type device a chromecast type competitor or something like that. What do you think of that idea?

205
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:45,780
Um, well, they tried well someone tried before doing their matchstick

206
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,820
Matchstick that we think that was horribly. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I

207
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:57,540
I'm I'm taking with a pinch of salt everything was that are doing at the moment. I haven't seen recently one of their

208
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
employees post a whole lot of

209
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,580
internal information about how

210
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,900
How the company works? I'm kind of just wait and see see what they come up with

211
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,100
Hmm kits and kitty. I want to hear your thoughts on this. I

212
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:17,540
Just think it's more in the line with all the news that has been coming out with Mozilla both good and bad

213
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,900
you know the bad being GTK 3 getting snubbed again and

214
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:28,500
45 but they do have all this really cool stuff working behind the scenes Mozilla servo

215
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,580
Which is breaking records right now in terms of JS performance

216
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,780
But the other interesting thing that I thought was

217
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:44,500
Rather interesting coming out of Mozilla was they're wanting to push gecko again. Did you hear about this in what context?

218
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,620
I mean the web browsers context or do you what do you mean when gecko is the rendering engine of Firefox, right as a framework?

219
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,260
To build other applications. It was

220
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,740
hmm

221
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,260
well

222
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,260
That seems like a good idea

223
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:05,380
well, um, that seems like it almost makes more sense, even though I don't I don't know why that is

224
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,420
Boy, yeah, that's an uphill fight

225
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:12,100
It is and I just like whenever I see this story

226
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,940
It just makes me think back to the icky situation around the early

227
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,960
2000s where they tried to do the same thing and they came out with like nightingale

228
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:26,740
Uh music player, etc. Oh great. Yeah, I forgot about that. Yeah, and it was just a bunch of uh,

229
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,120
disappointment really one thunderbird

230
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,160
Yeah

231
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
quiet

232
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,600
Uh, that's interesting. Hmm. I I was a good player though. Yeah, actually I would like I would love

233
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,240
I would love to see where they go with this

234
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,760
In other things, uh, I don't even know what the hell that means and it gives me a little bit of a stick in my

235
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,760
Stomach every time I think of it

236
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,200
I I know it's something that it's the only thing they talk about at trade shows right now and I know it's uh,

237
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
it's a huge industry I just

238
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
I

239
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
It feels like 3d to me a little bit

240
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
you know, it feels like uh

241
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,080
It's something we all talk about and it's something we all procrastinate about or you know

242
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,760
Procrastinate or whatever you want to say about what's gonna could or couldn't could go wrong

243
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:17,200
But who's actually buying these things outside of geeks that are just dorking around with them like you?

244
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm not even buying things is is marketing to not geeks

245
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,640
It's like all kind like the amazon echo and stuff like that. I think the echo is the

246
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,000
I think the echo is the biggest example of a successful internet of things product

247
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,640
And I think what we do is we just arbitrarily go around and say well

248
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,720
This is now an internet of things product. What makes it an internet of things product?

249
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,880
It has an ip address. Is that where we're drawing the line?

250
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,480
It can query apis. Is that what makes it an internet of things?

251
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,120
I think it's just it's a device that has access to the internet

252
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,240
By itself without having to connect to any other devices, but it doesn't have access to the internet by itself

253
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,080
It requires a infrastructure in place a a wi-fi

254
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,600
LAN and a router, but I mean like it doesn't have to connect to like another like for example the freaking

255
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,040
Android watches like they require another device to even work

256
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Like that's what okay

257
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,280
Okay, boy, that's that's a pretty broad broad definition

258
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,680
Yeah, but also, you know

259
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:19,200
It goes to the same thing about the cloud being incredibly broad. Well, doesn't that technically make the xbox and the playstation?

260
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,720
An internet of thing device that's an or smart TVs were kind of an early front of that

261
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,840
So I think it depends on how much they're made the default, you know

262
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,080
Yeah, it's starting to feel like a lot of marketing bs it's starting to feel like

263
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,560
You can call it a successful category because you can call anything an internet of things device and therefore if anything sells

264
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,560
That you put that label on you can say internet of things is successful, but in the broad context

265
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Nobody's actually buying the shit or putting it in their homes

266
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,800
Uh except for us geeks and even then I think it's a subset of the geeks

267
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:57,120
Like I don't have a nest or the only internet of things like I have hues lights because i'm in a studio

268
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,440
And I want to match color to my green screen. That's a pretty niche reason to buy hues lights

269
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,120
Otherwise, I don't know if I would buy them like they're not in your kitchen. I bought them and gave them to my dad as a gift

270
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:12,240
And he's colorblind so that's not even a great gift like he uses them

271
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,280
You know like it feels like it is a gimmick

272
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:23,600
And I don't know so I wish mozilla all the luck as they cast off into a completely nebulous category

273
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840
That seems to have no meaning to me. I mean

274
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,320
Anybody can feel free to disagree with me in the mumba room

275
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,240
But to me it feels like anything we want is internet of things when they say this is what they're doing

276
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,120
It sounds like a company that doesn't have really great focus is moving into a category that doesn't have any focus

277
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
Sounds like a recipe for disaster to me

278
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,960
But you know, they do have that super fast javascript thing down. So that's true soon as they ship that

279
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,520
Yeah

280
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,360
Soon as they ship that. All right

281
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,320
So we have a few more updates to go through uh before we get into some meat of the show

282
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,080
But I thought this one was interesting. I was getting tweeted this one a lot this week the fail overflow folks have released their ps4

283
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,720
K exec style code to load the current linux kernel

284
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,480
From the freebie freebsd based os. So that is really something they're not cool

285
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,640
They're not breaking the playstation. It's a kernel module. Wes. They must have had to break the kernel module must be signed

286
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,720
I mean they must have to have a sign module. So like what they say with this is that you need a way

287
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,600
To execute this. Ah, so if you get yourself an exploit like theirs was in webkit

288
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,800
For example, then you just take this you can compile it up run it and boom. There you go

289
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,280
Now you run it codes up on github. Yeah, I think that's pretty neat. That's pretty cool. You know what that means

290
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,160
That wolf cluster. Yep. Yeah, it does mean a cluster though. That is that is and they were talking about how they like

291
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
extract the radion driver and

292
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,560
Make it like work with linux this to me actually like if I was gonna buy a console would push it

293
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,600
I mean I was already in ps4, but this would push it right?

294
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,400
For for a linux geek like me. Oh, man. Yeah, probably it pushes it. It's just fun to make it right

295
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,320
I don't know. I had gen 2 on a wii at one point. Maybe maybe one day

296
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,000
Maybe one day they can really get some performance out of it and use a tin code video. Oh

297
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,400
I see your angle. All right, so I gotta give a little shout out to the elementary os folks

298
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,280
we talked last week with wimpy about funding of ubuntu mate and uh

299
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,160
Daniel from elementary os has posted an update about some of their funding initiatives

300
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,800
He said I want to put a quick update about our bounties as you might know elementary has a bug bounty program where we pay

301
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,640
Out people to fix certain issues anyone can create a bounty on any issue or contribute to an existing bounty. It's pretty great

302
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,760
So far elementary has paid out over 14 000 to developers fixing bugs

303
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,480
Uh, here's some of the big ticket ones were that are still open and you know what I you know

304
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,720
I was looking through this wes and something sort of really jumped out at me as I was browsing through elementary os's bounty source. Yeah

305
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,720
um

306
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,280
And I had an off off air conversation with daniel in the subreddit a little bit about this too

307
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,280
Because I asked, you know, is it slow things down because you can't just go contact the developers directly

308
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,320
And daniel said well, uh, no, we think it doesn't and he said he said I like the kind of transparency that it provides

309
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,920
Uh, of course bounty source isn't loading right now. That's the bounty source website

310
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's just all that's a whole lot of white in your face

311
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,240
But what you what you get by looking at elementary os's bounty source page is you get an idea of where the project is going

312
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,600
Like i'm pretty clear like you can see there's 300 worth of money to work on the file manager right now

313
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,320
And what those top you can really see where they're putting their money. Yeah

314
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,920
Where's the top concerns in the file manager?

315
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,120
They link all the bugs in the bounty source to launchpad, uh bugs too

316
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,360
Which is kind of a nice way to do for a boom to base distro

317
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
So it seems like a pretty good system wimpy

318
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,120
I wanted to just sort of get your sort of off the cuff take on a system like bounty source versus sort of the funding

319
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,480
that you've sort of come up with where you're working with developers directly and

320
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,240
Did you look at bounty source and decide it wasn't for you or you just think it's a a different strokes for different folks

321
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
What's your impressions on that?

322
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Yeah, I mean bounty source is um

323
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:00,820
It's definitely a tool, uh platform that you can take advantage of I did look at it and I decided

324
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,240
Uh, it's a small project. We've been to math

325
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,200
There's a small project with a small group of people and I wanted to focus on

326
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,440
on building relationships with people rather than

327
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,760
so

328
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,320
With bounty source you can have a drive by committer who can choose to work on a thing

329
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
For 50 or whatever it might be

330
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,280
And work on that one thing and then never be engaged with the project again

331
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,080
And I wasn't so keen on that approach. I wanted to

332
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,760
um

333
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:40,080
Approach and reward people that had demonstrated a commitment to the project. So that's sort of the the

334
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,160
The route that i've taken I think that and I could also see different depending on the scale of the project how a different approach

335
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,400
Makes sense too. Yeah, I like I like browsing through there and uh seeing what they want fixed and I like the idea

336
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,480
that as a sort of somebody who doesn't have any capacity to um

337
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,880
Contribute code I could contribute money to their bounty source

338
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:07,200
But then also I found myself kind of confused like should I be contributing to the patreon or should I be contributing to the bounty?

339
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
source seems like

340
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,760
It would be better just to sort of focus everyone's efforts in one spot. Let them decide where it should go

341
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,240
Yeah

342
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,760
But well the patreon is like what they do the bounty sources is what they decide needs to get attention

343
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,800
So if you go to the patreon you're giving money to the project to then they could disperse it to bounty source

344
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,120
Wherever they deem that makes sense. Okay. Yeah, and that's that's so that's and of course

345
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,000
You could you could subscribe to bounty source directly too. It's yeah. Yeah, but there's also um

346
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,080
Like just to point out that 14 000 number is not true

347
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,080
They this is they've already posted this before not not this particular example, but about two months ago

348
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,000
They posted like we got 9 000 out for bounties and it's like well no

349
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,080
That's the total number that is potential to be given

350
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Well, he's saying number given but he's saying here in this post he's saying paid out

351
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,520
He's saying that we have paid out not what's event what's hanging out there hanging

352
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,720
Yeah, but if you look at the claimed bounties, um, the math is not accurate. There's like four thousand dollars missing from their claim

353
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,720
Which i'm not saying that they aren't doing what there's you know

354
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,920
They're not doing a good thing and getting developers money and stuff like that

355
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,440
I'm just saying that they they they kind of inflated a little bit

356
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:24,000
So the uh, I always prefer them not to do that bounty source page is not loading properly for me right now

357
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,680
But it is worth it. There's a link in the show notes. It's actually I think

358
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,520
Elementary os when you when you follow them from the outside seems a little opaque

359
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,840
It's kind of hard to see what they're doing where they're going, you know, they got they're probably working on stuff

360
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,680
But when you go to this it's it's sort of

361
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,560
Sort of it's like pulling back the curtains insider's view. Yeah, you can you can get a you can get a pretty quick

362
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:48,880
Uh, yeah, this page just loaded for me. So you can see there's 625 dollars worth of bounties available for their new mail program

363
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,720
elementary os

364
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:56,560
565 bounties for gtk plus 520 for the shell 365 midori

365
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,160
315 pantheon files and they have different stuff in here

366
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,840
You can see like for their app center

367
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,000
One of the things they want work on worked on is the show the most popular apps feature and they're willing to pay money

368
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,520
for that nice

369
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,640
I remember this is making me excited for when their next version comes out. Yeah, it's been so long and I haven't wanted to

370
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,160
The current one's so old it is it is kind of fascinating to watch it

371
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,320
From that perspective, so I decided I'd toss him a few bucks to the bounty source

372
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,680
Just because I think it's an interesting idea

373
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,160
Totally, you know because when i'm i'm the reason why i'm what i'm

374
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,040
For those of you that are wondering why i'm looking at this stuff so much is

375
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,280
I eventually want to come up with a model like this for jb when we can afford to do so through our patreon

376
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,800
But I don't know

377
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,320
Support the community that keeps you here. And so I was kind of looking at the wimpy's model

378
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,360
I like that a lot because I like establishing those relationships with people, right?

379
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,080
Uh, but then this is another way to go

380
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,200
But this seems like for something that's not a if you're not a software project this this model doesn't really work very well

381
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,120
But it's interesting to kind of check in and see what different people are doing and I find both

382
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,720
Approaches to be very valid. So it's it's good to watch I think

383
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:00,240
All right, wes the way yes, go ahead. You could adapt the way you could adapt bounty source to jb

384
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,560
Is that if you are using?

385
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,920
uh open source software in the production of

386
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,520
your

387
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,520
podcasts and video casts

388
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:17,040
You could post bounties to add features or fix issues in the tools that you're using

389
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,040
Sure, because that that way then let's pick ffmpeg because I know you use it a lot

390
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,840
Let's suppose you need it to tell you the price of tea in china

391
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:33,360
You put a bounty up for that to happen in ffmpeg and ffmpeg benefit and you've clearly funded that

392
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,360
Body of work so you could make it work for you know

393
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,000
You know what you're doing and it might be a little easier to navigate because obviously elementary is a

394
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,800
A rather large project and there's lots and lots of bounties there and I imagine your the scope of your bounties would be a lot

395
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Smaller. Yeah

396
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,520
There's a there's a big problem bounty source though in the sense that if you put money out for a particular thing

397
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,000
And then no one does it that money is still out

398
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Like there's a difference between pay like that

399
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,160
This is actually one of the things that are mentioned about them paying money to developers

400
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,200
This is not true because of the way bounty source is structured

401
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,680
You're paying money to bounty source because as soon as it's put into that particular project to or that task

402
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,920
It bounty source takes that money

403
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:23,520
So maybe elementary has paid out that amount of money in general to bounty source, but no one's actually claimed it

404
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,480
So if you don't like if you scroll down their list

405
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:32,080
It says this is how much has been claimed by developers and it's it's a lot different than what has actually been put into the

406
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,800
The bounty source itself. So if you're going to

407
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,520
Donate to a particular project. It's better to just give them the money to the project

408
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,080
And say maybe maybe ask the ear market for this purpose or something

409
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,760
That sucks for elementary. So you're saying that elementary have

410
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,400
Put money into bounty source to say we want these things

411
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:59,200
Implemented or fixed or whatever they want and they've paid some 14 000 in to a thing

412
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,520
And that money has been invested by them, but the work hasn't been done

413
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,480
And it's the money's effectively sitting in escrow waiting for somebody to do the work

414
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,800
Yes, there's about four thousand waiting for someone to do it

415
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,440
I guess they figure that it's in the wash that eventually somebody will come along and claim that work

416
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
I hope so. Yeah, what happens if that does it?

417
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,200
Or you maybe the people don't even maybe there are people in those projects

418
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,080
They're not even aware that those are a thing that they're willing to pay for

419
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,640
And what if you cancel? Oh, that's a good point. Like if it's gtk work, for example

420
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,560
A gtk maintainer might not even know there's a a elementary bounty for it

421
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,320
yeah, he might even do the work and then that money is just

422
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,280
Already put into banning source, but no one claims because they didn't know to claim it and it's just there forever

423
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,320
I guess until they cancel the project right if they canceled that line item, I guess it would probably return the money

424
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,040
I'm, not sure about that

425
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,880
I I didn't know that's how bounty source worked. I'd certainly be really interested in hearing more about

426
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,280
particularly from elementary

427
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:05,200
um, i've just listened to a fascinating podcast today with stewart langridge on the uh, simply elementary podcast

428
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,080
It was a really insightful talk about his experiences with elementary and some of his

429
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,480
Thoughts on on their project and their direction. It's a great listen

430
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,440
If you if you've not heard that it's definitely one to go and listen to

431
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,800
But I I feel bad for elementary that they may have invested money that they're

432
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,000
Not getting full value out of

433
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,680
I would I would estimate it's a matter of counseling the bounty and then the money probably returns

434
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,760
So if so, but then it's but then of course, it's just the process of administratively following up on those things, right?

435
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,800
Yeah, there's a few of those gtk things those line items for gtk. They've been in for a while

436
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:48,080
For a while. I I know for at least at least two of those i've seen for a long time because I used I was

437
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,960
when they first the reason I know about this thing about a source of stuff is because when they announced this like

438
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,480
Uh a couple months ago

439
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,680
They said like 9 000 was paid out and I had a conversation with daniel and one of the developers that essentially

440
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,160
I was I realized that it's not

441
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,560
It's not exactly paid out to a developer. It's just paid out to bounty source

442
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:11,440
So, um, I didn't ask him about what happens if you cancel it, but um, hopefully

443
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,480
They could if they cancel that they get the money back. But at the moment it's just you know in limbo

444
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,200
Yeah, bounty source seems to have continued to grow but it hasn't grown at the rate i've expected either

445
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:27,600
So they have continued to expand it's it's uh, it's worth. I've also kind of created as

446
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,760
code based

447
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,960
Patreon type thing too. Hmm. I think that's interesting. I think for us i'm going to look at it

448
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,000
I'm going to look at it. I don't know if if if it works directly well for us or not, but I like it

449
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,240
So i'm going to play around more keep looking into it. I'd love to hear from the elementary os project. Yeah, absolutely

450
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,320
Okay, so I want to shift gears and start talking about this new own cloud release

451
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,320
This looks like version 9 is a pretty big deal. Uh, and you know, you could probably deploy

452
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,520
Own cloud on a digital ocean droplet. They'll probably have

453
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,640
They'll probably have a really easy deployment here in a few days for version 9

454
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,960
So use our promo code if you would do unplugged and get a ten dollar credit over digital ocean

455
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,880
Digital ocean is a simple cloud housing provider dedicated offering most intuitive and easy way for you

456
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,560
Discipline up your own server up in the cloud. They have uh, mostly linux. I mean, let's be honest west

457
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,160
It's the superior os

458
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,280
But they do have a little free bsd too. You can get that's your fancy

459
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:17,760
Yeah

460
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,880
You can get started in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans start only five dollars per month for 512 megabytes of ram

461
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,640
A 20 gigabyte ssd because they all ssd's a blazing fast cpu and a terabyte of transfer

462
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:34,880
Their pricing plan is crazy straightforward. In fact, you can go to their pricing page and do yourself a favor tab it over to hourly

463
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,040
Look at that wes

464
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:43,360
Three cents an hour two gigabytes of ram two core processor 40 gigabyte ssd and three terabytes of transfer, you know

465
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,800
It's kind of it's becoming you have just something you want to do. Oh you're compiling the kernel

466
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,000
Yeah, just do it on digital ocean droplet, you know

467
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,560
If you're using things like docker too, it's really ridiculously fast

468
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,120
You can get deployed on a droplet in no time and they've data centers in new york san francisco. Singapore, Amsterdam london

469
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,120
Toronto

470
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,620
Germany got a new one opened up in india, too. That stuff's crazy. I tell you what, but you know, it's cray cray

471
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,620
super cray cray

472
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,620
intense cray cray

473
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,500
That interface. Yeah. Oh my goodness wes that interface is so good. They have a straightforward interface

474
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,140
That's very easy to use but yet extremely powerful

475
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:21,220
I'm saying you can set like multiple machines dns host names at the same time set up ssh private keys backups

476
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:26,580
You can transfer between data centers. You can do private networking. You can destroy the machine

477
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:32,260
It html5 console all of that one click application deployment, but it's still cray cray simple

478
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,900
I'm saying cray cray simple and they have a straightforward api

479
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,300
To make it even better

480
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,820
To just step it up a notch

481
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:42,820
They have a really great api and there's a lot of great open source code written around and go check out some of those

482
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,140
Great community tutorials written too in their community section super good stuff super

483
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:53,780
Really well written well documented digital ocean.com. Just use the promo code do unplugged and a big

484
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,620
Thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring linux unplugged linux unplugged

485
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,140
Okay, so, uh, I don't know if uh, you guys in the mumble room are own cloud users wes

486
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,620
Are you an own cloud user? Come on wes on and off again

487
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,700
But i've been thinking about using it again

488
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,900
I got I got an own cloud instance

489
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:13,220
I've been running out for about a year and I got a real heavy into it for a bit and I backed off for file

490
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,580
Syncing i've been using it for card dav and cal dab. See that's what I was thinking about. Yeah

491
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:21,460
Are you liking it? I do and I use sync thing for the file syncing and i'm using dropbox still as well

492
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,460
Hmm can't help it

493
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,180
So own cloud 9 is shipping

494
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:31,300
Uh, and this is kind of a major release the own cloud version 9 shipped with code signing

495
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:34,020
They say which promises to offer users with safer

496
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:40,900
Code, I don't know exactly how but by verifying the integrity of their own cloud installations during upgrades or installing apps

497
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,900
code signing

498
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,700
Yeah

499
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:50,020
Uh, they say with 8 million users own cloud is the world's leading file sync and share solution providing users with safe home for all

500
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:55,860
Of their data founded six years ago as a project with the goal of bringing privacy and control back to users own cloud is where it

501
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,300
Is today thanks to contributions from well over a thousand

502
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,900
Open source programmers designers translators and others

503
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,780
Uh the big hot features

504
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:10,260
You ready for this one? Oh, I want I want to hear administrators will happily

505
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:16,680
Happily learn that it is now possible to add as many own cloud servers as they want or need as trusted servers to their infrastructures

506
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:21,980
Multiple own cloud servers y'all sharing and exchanging of usernames along with automatic name completion

507
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:29,160
Yeah from all the shared servers is a breeze trusted own cloud servers can be manually added by admins who have control over the automatic

508
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,600
edition of servers

509
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,080
And starting version 9.0 organizations and institutions like cern. Yeah, that's right

510
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,120
We'll be able to integrate deeply with their massive own cloud installations with their various storage solutions

511
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,380
In their infrastructure thanks to the addition of a new storage api

512
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:49,900
That allows for unimaginable scaling levels. Don't even try to imagine it folks built into own cloud

513
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:55,500
Enterprise edition is also coming next month. We got some nice ui improvements that look great. Hello slack

514
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,540
Nice calendar. Hello

515
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,620
It's looking really good

516
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,540
I want to talk a little bit more about this

517
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,380
But I thought instead of me talking about it west I'd play a little bit from the own cloud site

518
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,500
Are you ready for this one? Let's hear it. This is direct from the own cloud site

519
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:16,700
I thought we'd hear it from the horse's mouth as always. We are working hard to give you tools to manage your files. Wait

520
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:20,620
Wait, that's no good. That was no good

521
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,740
I we got it. We got it. We got it. We got to give them a little tip

522
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,340
Let's fix that out. Hold on. Stop the show. Stop the show. We got to give them a little tip

523
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,620
This is this is us contributing back to the open source community wess

524
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,580
This is how we would do if you're gonna create you first you got to get yourself some hipster kickstarter music

525
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:41,020
For the that is essential, right? So you get that going that makes everything sound better

526
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,500
You wait for that to play a little bit then you start your video

527
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,780
Hello own clouders and welcome to your personal guided tour of own cloud 9

528
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:54,860
The newest own cloud release is full of improvements and new features

529
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:02,540
This is better, right much better. Let's start on the main files page. This is the default landing for the web interface

530
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:07,020
In fact, we should just have that for the whole show. That's not bad. I'm down to keep listening

531
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,660
So that's our advice to the own cloud project good release solid release

532
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:17,260
But you know, maybe uh put some hipster music in that video. Come on now, so it makes everything better

533
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,500
Uh, look at that though. It's looking really great. So own cloud 9 wess

534
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,900
What's been holding back sharing? What's been holding you back? Be honest with me

535
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,700
Take the gloves off wess

536
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,860
I think mostly just that there had been those concerns about you know large file syncing and I have

537
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,620
I've been using sync thing for a long time. So i've had that problem solved

538
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,380
So it's more been like am I ready?

539
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,860
Do I want to set up the card dev cal dev server?

540
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,580
But with like the documents app and like kind of the more features they're getting it's making it more like well

541
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:51,180
I already have more than enough servers lying around or I could spin up in an instant. So why not man?

542
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,580
This ui is looking is looking really good too

543
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:59,260
Anybody in the mumble room currently using own cloud and willing to maybe try upgrading to version 9 and reporting back in the near future

544
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,780
I'm I might do it

545
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,660
Oh, look at that. No, wait, hold on. Sorry. Let me see. That would be completely unknown

546
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,180
Nobody wants to do it. All right fine

547
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:16,860
I've never installed gnu slash. Oh, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. You could take the you can take the fault

548
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,940
I don't want to have to do it

549
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,380
I'm not using it at the moment. I've tried

550
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,980
Uh, I think five six seven and eight

551
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,940
And yeah, the file syncing

552
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:32,540
Uh was a thing that I wanted to work and it didn't work for me

553
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,340
But i'm gonna try nine again

554
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:42,940
And I really want own cloud to work and and there are features of own cloud that I should be using because I do have

555
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:43,980
um

556
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:50,060
Sort of um notes that I sync around between all of my machines and it would make much more sense to actually

557
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:55,500
Use something like own cloud to synchronize that stuff. Yeah, I think I really want

558
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:00,380
I really want the file syncing to work and that just hasn't quite cut it in the past

559
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:07,020
So with that article about CERN and all of their petabytes of data that they're shunting around the place every day

560
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:12,220
I'm hope hoping that that's just not marketing spiel and and that's really being

561
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,020
I see i'm worried that until they replace c-sync

562
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:20,860
Because of the underlying sync library. I just I worry that the the actual client sync is never going to be enough

563
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,540
I just want to be good enough

564
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:26,700
So like my wife or I could like put up have a own cloud server with my friends

565
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,740
You know what you could do too is you could always point own cloud at a sync thing directory

566
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,180
That seems like the way to go

567
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,100
So I want to get a couple other people to jump here. So Rarian, you're you're a heavy own cloud user

568
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,060
Could you tell us are you looking forward to version 9? What are your thoughts?

569
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,820
I don't know. We'll see

570
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:47,660
Are you too worried or you're too dependent on it to upgrade?

571
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:52,540
I'm too dependent on it to upgrade. I I've had a problem with any

572
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:59,520
Syncing issues like you guys have described but I don't sync huge files like isos

573
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:05,500
So, okay. I'd be curious to see what muhahaha has to say in the mumble room

574
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,220
Does it sound like you might be planning to upgrade to version 9?

575
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:14,700
Yes, I just start to use it. So I don't think it will be that big of a problem. You're already using version 9

576
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:21,260
Oh, um 8.1. Oh, oh, oh, you mean it's a sort of a fresh install of 8.1. So it's probably gonna be an easy

577
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:25,340
Yeah, that does make sense. Yeah. Yeah jump on that. That's why you can all right

578
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,140
Maybe I should do it. It seems like yeah, maybe it'll be fun to just get it going

579
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,140
I could do a review of it too if I didn't upgrade

580
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:36,060
And would people be a chat room? Would you be interested in a rate and share files with each other?

581
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,940
Do people care anymore? Yeah, go ahead

582
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,940
Sorry, uh, so

583
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,500
I you I know you're a heavy gnome user chris and uh, so am I

584
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:53,900
And it integrates very well with the gnome desktop it integrates with the built-in notes app in gnome

585
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,460
Uh, so it's easy to sync notes across. It's really great in that regard

586
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,780
Hmm

587
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,780
See i've been i've actually been really enjoying mate

588
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,580
Okay, so I was actually considering

589
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:11,500
Switching but yeah. Yeah, that is nice. That is nice. You're just dropping the bomb like that. Yeah

590
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,540
Well, I don't know. It's just I've been I sat i've been using the apollo a lot and then when I sat down

591
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,020
Uh at the gnome 3 desktop

592
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,820
It was the file manager the file manager

593
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,860
I like I prefer the way kaja

594
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,500
works

595
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,420
That to me just works better. But yeah points well taken. I do like the integration with gnome 3

596
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,460
I'll consider if people are interested. Let me know about a review of own cloud

597
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:39,020
I'll take a look at it. Even if it even if it blows up in your face. That's still another episode. Jeez. Thanks

598
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,460
Thanks. Yeah. Uh, well, hey, no, I can't blow up my face because

599
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,180
code signing

600
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,700
You're secure code signing good to go. Don't have to worry about it

601
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,740
Hmm, I guess I do like the idea of updates

602
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,580
But you know, this is all goes back to own clouds when one of the big advocates that don't get updates from their repo

603
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,740
Right get them from us directly

604
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:02,220
All right, i'll dig around i'll see where i'll give it a i'll give it a consideration, you know, I was

605
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,860
I've been i've been recently thinking too about using own cloud to store. Uh,

606
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,900
Like a digital filing cabinet because uh, I just got so much paperwork, right?

607
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:16,060
Like, you know, like when you buy something or you get a divorce

608
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,620
Or you get a loan or whatever

609
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:24,060
Like there's just moments in your life where all of a sudden you have all this paperwork just dropped in your lap

610
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:30,140
And I feel like if at that point in time if I scanned it and saved it to a system that I used for years

611
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,220
I could I could actually manage this

612
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:35,580
But the problem is I set all the paperwork down aside and then it just goes a scatter

613
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,540
It goes all over the place and it never makes into a filing cabinet

614
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:43,580
So I was thinking geez if I could if I could get some scans of these things put them in an own cloud server

615
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,420
That's protected

616
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,260
But then I would be every time it came time to do an upgrade. I'd be like, oh my stuff you need backups

617
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,220
Yeah, that's true. You need backups. That's a good point

618
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:57,420
So I might I might I might give it a go because I have been needing like a digital vault for some things like that

619
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:01,340
And so you never know you never know kaja is pronounced kaha

620
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,700
Not like cougar or coger

621
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:10,860
Yeah, kaja the file manager kaha kaha. It's a good file manager. Yeah, it is a good reminds me of the good old days

622
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:15,180
All right, you know what else reminds me of the good old days ting because they're keeping mobile simple, man

623
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,620
They're keeping mobile simple and I love that they're just out to make mobile make sense

624
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,340
It's your minutes your messages your megabytes and that's what you pay

625
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:27,820
It's a flat six dollars for the line and it's your usage on top of that very straightforward. No contracts

626
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,980
No early termination fees

627
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,980
Really good customer support

628
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,740
It's kind of obvious average annual savings per device for a business

629
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,940
with 11 to 20 employees per device

645
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,600
You'll be very happy you did. I think so linux.ting.com and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring linux unplugged

646
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,560
Okay, we got to talk about this a little bit with the virtual lug because I just don't know what to make of it

647
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:03,720
Microsoft's gone totally cray-cray and they've announced sequel server on linux

648
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:09,800
On linux. Popey and I had a chance to talk about this a little bit today on tech talk today and Popey said he actually fell

649
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,400
Out of his his chair

650
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,080
So I think he was pretty surprised what was your reaction when Microsoft made this announcement. I was pretty surprised too

651
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,080
I'm curious to see it running

652
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,040
Yeah, so mumble room. Let me know in the chat room if you have well

653
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,740
I'd love to know your initial reactions, but Popey for those who didn't get a chance to listen to tech talk

654
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:32,580
Recap here your thoughts when you heard that sequel server coming out for Linux, and what do you think it means?

655
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:38,380
Popey that's your just talking to you Popey anyway, all right

656
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,660
Andy Karses you your takes you think this is a go to go up against Oracle you go

657
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:47,020
Yeah, I mean

658
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:52,620
There's been so much David losing so much ground to the Linux Oracle constellation hardware servers

659
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:56,700
I think you think that you so you really think it's more of a straight Oracle competition play and less of a

660
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:00,240
Trying to stay relevant by going to Linux play

661
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:08,660
Well, I mean they also want to sell this stuff like with virtualization being the primary platform being you know cloud first

662
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,900
Then you know the primary apparatus they need to get as much

663
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,740
Value at as they can so they need to like sell sequel server licenses

664
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:24,060
And if you're not gonna put Linux on the machine then at least you know be using a code for Visual Studio

665
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:29,460
Yeah, you know I think it's a pretty good move. I could I I wouldn't deploy it personally

666
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,460
But I could see it like at least from my perspective

667
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:36,400
you know if there's DBAs that manage the databases if that's what they want to do to provide like a

668
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:41,700
Redundant sequel interface that I connect to then if it works. That's great. I

669
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:46,860
I wonder if any of you recall a time and place where I

670
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,500
Was in a spot, and I wonder if any of you found yourselves there

671
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:57,740
You're sitting down you're trying to come up with the pros and cons of deploying different systems and when you look at an application

672
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,220
that required Microsoft sequel

673
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,700
from a Linux administrator standpoint I knew that meant a

674
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,420
Windows IIS server most likely a Windows server server

675
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:12,260
Windows sequel server, so maybe two three Windows servers locked into a sequel box

676
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:19,060
It meant that this was going to be yet another deployment a frickin Microsoft Windows and sequel sequel was the way

677
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:21,980
was such a was such a

678
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:28,000
Conversation stopper for me when I would go into oftentimes for clients one of the things I could do is we can move these things

679
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,460
Over to Linux you won't have to upgrade to Windows 2003 whatever etc etc won't have to go to 2008. We'll go to this

680
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:40,480
But when sequel came up that totally stopped the conversation and that in exchange right well, I'm just still

681
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:49,220
There's other things that's worse, but yeah, I wonder if if for people like me now who are coming into shops and

682
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,740
Trying to get people to move over

683
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:57,300
Maybe move off of Windows and move on to a different system like you could now spin up a frickin droplet running sequel server

684
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,980
Yeah, right right use that as your as your sequel server your your off-site premise of sequel server

685
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,700
I mean you can't right now Greece. It's not shipping at the moment, but it will be mid 2017. Yeah

686
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,700
they say I just find that to be a

687
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:15,580
Game changer, it's like and that combined with their announcement today as well

688
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:19,460
That they are joining the Eclipse Foundation

689
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,420
They say today

690
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:26,700
I'm happy to share that Microsoft is taking its relationship with the Eclipse community to the next level by joining the Eclipse Foundation as

691
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,860
a solutions member

692
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:35,360
Joining the Eclipse Foundation enables us to collaborate more closely with the Eclipse community to deliver a great set of tools and services for all

693
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,620
development teams

694
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:41,340
Continuously improve our cloud service services SDKs and tools what?

695
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:51,500
What did you know that at Microsoft their developer mission is to deliver experiences that empower any developer building any application on any OS

696
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:56,440
Get it out of here this I don't like that tone. I don't even I don't use though

697
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:03,560
Uh-huh. Yeah, it's pretty it's it's it's it's great except for the contradiction of the universal Windows platform

698
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:11,160
Yeah. Yeah, that is interesting in that light. You're right. You're right. I I actually wonder if this if this isn't really just about

699
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,720
Getting people to develop more services that use Azure in a long long run. I don't know though. I could be wrong on that

700
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,080
Java developers, don't you want to use Azure?

701
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:27,400
Yeah, wimpy you look at this and you say okay. We got Visual Studio code. We got Microsoft sequel

702
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,800
Dotnet going open source joining the Eclipse Foundation, but wimpy where the hell is Skype?

703
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,920
Where Skype?

704
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,600
well

705
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,600
And this is the important distinction

706
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,680
The previous four things you mentioned are all squarely

707
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,000
developer and enterprise focused and Skype is

708
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,240
desktop focused for Linux and

709
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,320
Microsoft don't love Linux Microsoft love enterprise Linux

710
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:03,920
And my only concern is if you adopt Microsoft SQL Server on Linux

711
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,280
What happens if it falls out of favor at some point in the future and you've got everything

712
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:17,240
Invested in it. Then where do you go? And this is why open source is the safe bet because you can't have

713
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,920
The rug pulled from beneath you, you know as best as people have tried when when Oracle

714
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,680
acquired

715
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:34,760
Open Office and MySQL and other projects and other organizations have they have always come out better and stronger because of open source. I

716
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,960
agree

717
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:44,520
What does Microsoft SQL have that Maria Mongo couch Postgres and the others don't?

718
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,360
Well now we're asking a question above my pay grade

719
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:52,760
But I do know that it's a well-respected SQL database server that has some nice features that I do know

720
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,200
Microsoft SQL Server. Yeah, I don't know

721
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:01,000
Microsoft on it. I well, I know the origins of the Microsoft SQL Server

722
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,040
Because I worked for the company that Microsoft

723
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:11,240
Bought their SQL Server from in order to create Microsoft SQL Server. This story is going full circle of us

724
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,480
Way way way way back. So Microsoft SQL Server was actually

725
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:24,800
Sybase SQL Server four point something. Oh, I remember that and they they bought the rights to the old

726
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,440
Code, so I think when Sybase released Sybase

727
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,600
SQL

728
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:38,420
10 or 11 they sold the source code to four point nine or something like that to Microsoft and then Microsoft, you know

729
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,240
reinvented it into Microsoft SQL Server

730
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:47,600
Yeah, wow good good callback. That is that does ring a bell. So what do you think wimpy?

731
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,600
What were your impressions when you heard this story?

732
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,720
That's that's a history with this

733
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,800
well, I was never involved in that side of the business at Sybase, but

734
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:04,160
It doesn't surprise me. I mean, yeah, Microsoft's loving of Linux is clearly enterprise focused and

735
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:10,080
It makes sense for them to have their database product in that lineup alongside

736
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,640
You know with the Xamarin acquisition and they develop a story

737
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:20,080
Which I think is going to continue to grow and we will probably see other Microsoft technologies

738
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:24,720
I think we'll know when they're really serious when exchange could run on Linux

739
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:27,680
Yeah, you know, I just look at this now though

740
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,480
And I two things strike me about this number one when it comes to Microsoft

741
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:38,440
You now live in a world where you can use Visual Studio code to write open source.net software to use Microsoft SQL services or

742
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,920
Linux servers running on Azure

743
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,040
That's pretty weird

744
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:46,680
And then the other thing that I find to be really interesting about this is at the other end of the spectrum is Apple

745
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:53,560
Open-sourcing Swift making Linux general libraries and the runtime available. I like all of the compiler like

746
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:57,040
This is a really crazy time for Linux on the server

747
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:02,760
It is it is so far and above the accepted platform now for on the server side. It's really remarkable

748
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,720
So eat that free BSD. I'm sorry. What what'd you say? What?

749
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:11,040
I didn't hear a word. This is BSD unplugged

750
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:18,360
Yeah, yeah, go ahead with yeah, I think you're right I think that

751
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:24,200
My Microsoft are reinventing themselves as a well as two things

752
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:28,320
It's clear. It's cloud and mobile

753
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,280
There are cloud and mobile first organization, which I would never quite understood how you can be first in two things

754
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,280
But hey, hey. Yeah, I thank you. Thank you

755
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:45,280
But I think this is a tacit admission that Linux has won the enterprise server space and that Microsoft have to

756
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,320
be a

757
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:53,480
Provider of software in that enterprise market in order to continue to be relevant, right?

758
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,320
it really has nothing to do with Microsoft being a good open source citizen or

759
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,680
No, and keep in mind sequels not open source, right? Just releasing it for Linux runs

760
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,960
It has to do with that

761
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:10,480
Linux is in such a market a dominant position that after years they finally bent to this position

762
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,560
But they seem like they're bending fast now

763
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:18,760
Yeah, now that they've come to this new reality. They seem like they're actually moving in the direction

764
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:23,720
Yeah, I mean this this sequel server must have been in the works for some time because that's not something you just cook up

765
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,480
You know in in short term that must have been

766
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:34,320
Going for you know, many many months. Yeah, and and even in terms of internal staff knowledge

767
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:39,200
Retooling your staff to work on Linux or bringing the staffing up. That's a big move

768
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:45,280
Yeah, like that all of that takes like when you think about behind the scenes a company who makes a competitive product

769
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,480
Having to retool to ship this on Linux

770
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:55,520
That's that's some interesting stuff right there and it's Microsoft we're talking about it's not Adobe which would be incredible

771
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,680
It's Microsoft and man, there's a lot of people that figure all into that

772
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,680
Just want to get things done crowd. It's like that's the tool they know

773
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:06,680
Mm-hmm, and so if that means that they can deploy it on Linux and they'll just works. That's that's that's nice

774
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:12,880
Well exactly right, you know, you've now got a migration strategy that doesn't involve changing your underlying

775
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:20,760
rdbms right you can just have a Microsoft SQL Server on Linux that scales out horizontally and

776
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:28,240
Your application can scale with that and you're not constrained by the limitations of the underlying operating system

777
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:34,640
You know, which is you know in order to do web scale applications. You need to be able to do that these days

778
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,000
I bet it was I bet it was ZFS coming to a point to the made him do that was

779
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:49,400
Huh, this is interesting though and what's next is there something next for Microsoft is there another thing coming I

780
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,120
Don't think it's exchange because I think exchange is too hooked in with Active Directory

781
00:55:53,640 --> 00:56:00,560
Mm-hmm. So I think it's got to be see sequel sequel was its own beast on its own anyways. Yeah, so there's something else out there

782
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,200
Something else. They're gonna put office on Linux. No, I is

783
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,760
Oh, I hope not. Oh boy. I hope nice new you know, though

784
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:17,400
I do have a bit of a recommendation for all the gals and guys over at Microsoft that are having to train up on Linux

785
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,800
That's our friends over at Linux Academy

786
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:25,060
This is where you go to get brushed up on your skill set whether it's for your gerb whether it's maybe because you're a

787
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:31,220
Multinational multi-billion dollar corporations with tens of thousands of employees that has to retool on the new market reality

788
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:37,460
There's probably a use for Linux Academy. So go to Linux Academy comm slash unplug to get the unplug discount over

789
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,860
2325 video courses man

790
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:48,900
What would be crazy is a mash-up of over the like last year of that number because this has been going up and up and up

791
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,220
Self-paced courses are awesome and I love that for somebody who is self-motivated

792
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:57,980
But what I think is also really great about that is they have a great community to kind of help move you along a little

793
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:02,780
Bit when you need that and they have instructor help they have instructor help. They have instructor help did I mention?

794
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:08,900
Instructor mentoring is available. Yeah, that's nice scenario based labs. Those are really great

795
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:15,380
You can you go into an everyday environment you get something done you work in that advanced lab environment from beginning to end over SSH

796
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:16,940
So you're not an animal

797
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:22,940
Which is really nice. I tell you what Wes when I'm over at Linux Academy comm slash unplug

798
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:25,780
You know what I'm doing? I'm saving money on my future. Yeah, yeah

799
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:32,780
I'm making an investment in Chris and that feels good. The graded server exercises are brilliant. Why sit around and wait all day?

800
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,780
We got computers that can compute right now

801
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:41,560
Graded server exercise give you real-time feedback like a boost like they should you got a little exam anxiety. Ooh

802
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:47,180
Here's my tip drink a whole bunch before the test if you don't want to do that though

803
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:52,100
What you ought to do is go over to Linux Academy because they got stuff over that I'll help you prep for those exams

804
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:54,100
They have a fantastic

805
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,580
Availability planner you tell it how much time you got available

806
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:04,700
Automatically creates courseware for you you guys seven plus distros to choose from it's just the courseware and the server that it spins up

807
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:08,940
On demand. Oh, you need to learn AWS. They got courseware on that you get in the Red Hat stuff

808
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:16,720
They got courseware on that you're developing Python Ruby get into Android or PHP. Guess what courseware on that all of it and more

809
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,920
Linux academy.com slash unplugged go check them out and a big thank you to links Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

810
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:31,600
Okay, so I'm pretty sure I actually did a little research before the show to make sure I'm getting the pronunciation of this right

811
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:36,520
It's it's something we've never talked about before. It's kind of new. I hadn't really heard about it

812
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:40,920
It's called I think you say shaw link and I got a little video to introduce. Oh, let's see

813
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:46,120
Hi guys, welcome to my channel today. I'm making something absolutely amazing

814
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:53,120
It's called shashlik and in translation is basically big pieces of meat on the skewer, which are grilled or barbecued

815
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:58,360
Oh wait, that was that was another video. Sorry. No, it's not it's not barbecue skewers

816
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:06,680
It is software that allows you to transparently run Android applications on a standard Linux desktop as easily and simply as possible

817
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:14,680
Not large chunks of meat. Don't sound good though. That's too bad because I thought that was a you see much better than the own

818
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:19,680
Cloud video it says the music and they got music on the on this one. I thought that was pretty good music and me

819
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,960
Yeah, they got music meat and you know what it really yeah

820
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,400
At this to the JB repertoire

821
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:36,400
At this to the JB repertoire man, I'll tell you what you're gonna talk about if you're gonna talk about meat on sticks

822
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,400
This is that is well, unfortunately, it's not what we're talking about what we're talking about is shashlik and

823
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:48,400
Wes and I you you've tried it on a couple of desktops. I tried it on an arch desktop

824
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,400
I've tried it on an Ubuntu Mate 1510 desktop. What are you trying it on right now? I'm trying it on Linux Mint right here

825
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:59,400
Okay, so this is a pretty new project and I'm excited that they're like

826
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:04,400
They're really giving a go at this and it's it's it's a big ambitious project. I gotta say Wes

827
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,400
I ran into a few bumps

828
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,400
Yes, it's definitely it's definitely bumpy

829
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:16,400
Hmm. Okay. I was hoping maybe we had more success cuz I've only got one application. I've got one as well

830
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,400
But it did work, I mean it like it it really did work and that was cool. Okay. Okay. All right

831
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,400
So when I tried it, I tried the snapchat own cloud

832
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:29,400
I tried Evernote. I tried telegram. Oh, I didn't think of that

833
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:35,400
And here's the first couple of there's a couple of limitations when you're gonna run these Android apps on your Linux desktop

834
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,400
They have to have

835
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,400
x86 builds

836
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,400
Not all of them

837
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:45,400
On your Linux desktop. They have to have x86 builds

838
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:51,400
Not a lot of Google Play apps are doing that at the moment because you know people are downloading on mobile

839
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:57,400
They want them to be as small as possible. So they're optimizing the builds. So that's one big downside is it does have to have

840
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,400
x86 build in it another downside, of course

841
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:07,400
You're not gonna have play services and then maybe on the minor category of downsides is it does pull down a bunch of KD dependencies

842
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:14,400
Oh interesting. So I installed the dev on their website and it didn't it didn't you know, there were no dependencies

843
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,400
I just installed it. I did have to comment out it did try to use KDialog

844
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:24,400
Yes, I just commented that out and it's been working. Oh, okay. Okay, cuz it still prints the message

845
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,400
It's trying to make a dialogue for

846
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:33,400
Okay. Okay. So I did have a it looks like some things on F-Droid have the x86. Oh, yeah. Sure. Okay

847
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:40,400
That's nice that I was able to download the Jupiter broadcasting app and open the live stream on your desktop on my desktop

848
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:45,400
That's cool. Emulated Android. That was pretty neat. I wanted to try the audible app because I have an audible subscription

849
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:50,400
And there's no way to listen to audible on Linux that I know of and so I was like, well

850
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,400
That's a perfect opportunity is I will run the audible app. It just crashes immediately

851
01:01:54,400 --> 01:02:01,400
I couldn't get Evernote to install because Evernote didn't have an x86 build in their play store. So Evernote was a no-go

852
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:07,400
I will say it does seem to take quite some time to load. Yeah. Yeah that sounds a little

853
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,400
Little weird because the atom processes are x86

854
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,400
Yeah, I agree. I don't know

855
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:22,400
I thought that's why I thought there would be more there were x86 as well because there's there are x86 Android phones on the market

856
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:28,400
I was surprised by that Kodi would be an interesting one to try out the why would you bother since you could just use the Kodi Linux version

857
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,400
True. They show they show a whole bunch of apps

858
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:35,400
But the ones they don't actually show any of the ones I tried in there in their main screen

859
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:42,400
But here's what the experience is like is once you have it you download the APK you you tell shosh link to install it

860
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,400
And then it actually gets integrated in with your desktop launchers desktop menu

861
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:53,400
When you launch the app it shows up in your taskbar as a running application with the desktop app icon

862
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:59,400
So when I ran the audible app it showed up in my dock on gnome 3 and it had the audible icon

863
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:06,400
Which was pretty cool and I launched it by hitting the super key and typing audible in gnome 3 search and hitting enter

864
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:12,400
And so that but that part of it is really damn slick and they're iterating on this thing super super fast

865
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:18,400
I wonder if people out in the audience have messed with this anybody in the in the Bumble room mess with any of these

866
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:25,400
There's a couple other out there that let you run Android apps on your Linux desktop is anybody played with this in the mumble room

867
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,400
There's some validity to it I think

868
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,400
I've used not this one but I've used the one that Google was talking about

869
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:36,400
Right there's one that integrates in with the Chrome browser that I've used too

870
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:42,400
And there's also some I'm actually kind of yeah I was kind of bothered by when you said it uses K dialogue

871
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:47,400
It kind of makes me confused because KDE deprecated that like

872
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:50,400
Well there's that

873
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,400
You know that was just an install script too

874
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:57,400
Hmm okay well yeah I guess you were able to disable with that right so

875
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,400
I literally just commented that line out yes

876
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:05,400
Yeah yeah so it has so as you would imagine it's a couple it's a couple of pieces of technology

877
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,400
You have the shosh link D which runs Android space and responsible for a few things

878
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:15,400
Drawing a custom boot splash drawing the back and you know menu buttons and notification receiving and pass them to the host operating system

879
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:21,400
So that's pretty cool and then they have the runtime that's the desktop side of the integration layer provides small scripts to install APKs

880
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:26,400
Extracting the icon and creating the desktop menu icon and copying any relevant files around

881
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:33,400
It also provides the startup script which launched the emulator oh the emulator yeah that's the name suggests this is a fork of QMU

882
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:39,400
Of the QMU Android emulator from the SDK so that's where they're kind of getting the secret bolts

883
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:46,400
I see yeah it's modified to show the window icon and the title of the app are running not like the emulator

884
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:52,400
That's kind of an interesting approach though near future plans

885
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:57,400
Drop the manual APPD parsing fixed network stuff which I don't know what that means

886
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,400
Yeah I was I was you were able to stream video I was watching the live stream

887
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:09,400
Yeah simple window resizing to be more intuitive tighten the packaging getting access to the better access to the file system using fuse

888
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:14,400
It would be pretty neat like if you get this going and get good pass-through of you know devices

889
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:20,400
Honestly yeah because there are applications that come out for Android that I would kill to have on the Linux desktop

890
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:28,400
And I would use these for a decent Android or the Evernote client from Android that could actually use my microphone

891
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:37,400
Control clients on yes different things like that yes honestly you know what the huge light app would be nice to have on my desktop

892
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:44,400
A very simple app like that would be great so I could definitely see this there's a few things out there even maybe Microsoft Office

893
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:52,400
Hey possibly yep which is great great I remember many thoughts on Android apps on on the Linux desktop for you close the book on this topic

894
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:59,400
I haven't tried this but the idea is awesome because you guys should try it out and see which ones work see if we can find something that is it useful

895
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:04,400
Yeah I give them credit for shipping something right now yeah it's worth checking out and playing around with

896
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:09,400
It is a little hard to figure out like yeah when I installed the dev it didn't get added to the path or anything

897
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:16,400
Oh really I installed from the AUR on my machine and I did the bin so I did shoshlink-bin from the AUR

898
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:23,400
And then you saw I ran the you do the you do install and then there's run you don't have to mess with run but you do install install the APK right and that was it

899
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:32,400
But then you know you think about this maybe in context of Ubuntu phone right right and you think maybe this would be a decent way to run some APKs on Ubuntu phone

900
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:42,400
That would be pretty sweet be the right size hmm except for its arm yeah I gotta work on that so it's called shoshlink-shashlik

901
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:53,400
And we have a link in the showroom says no they do not want this for Ubuntu touch no Micah is upset about that sorry Micah sorry Micah you should join the mumble room and tell me why

902
01:06:53,400 --> 01:07:00,400
Because it might be a way to get some nice like what about Waze right what if you want Waze or what if you want Google Maps on your Ubuntu touch device

903
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:08,400
I don't know if they would work because the play API and all that but I think I think they're actually some serious I think they're actually some serious uses for this

904
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:18,400
Doesn't mean stop developing Linux desktop applications certainly not that would be crazy we would never say that you know what else is crazy not attending a live Linux unplugged

905
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:32,400
Oh just don't make that mistake be here you really you really sold that way don't don't don't do that that would be don't don't no hey you know we should give a quick mention

913
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:26,400
Rekai mentions I can use MPV to listen to audible books I don't know I don't know how to do that but that sounds good Rekai you gotta give me details on that

914
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:38,400
Oh I just installed Flappy Bird really using the using the thing I don't know if it'll work but that would be that would be decent that wouldn't be bad you know a games yeah that wouldn't be bad yeah

915
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:51,400
That's actually a game that I'm surprised hasn't been ported to Linux is Flappy Bird or like a clone of it yeah because there's web versions of it everywhere and there's like 5,000 different clones of it

916
01:09:51,400 --> 01:10:02,400
Well Rodden I wouldn't mind a K Flappy Bird on my system that runs natively no that's Clappy Bird Clappy Bird oh there we go I like that come on let's not talk about that

917
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:17,400
Hey look at Rekai linking me to the Arch wiki here with how to play your frickin audible books use an MPV how about that I got Icon are you are you playing Flappy Bird not yet it's loading very slowly it's very slowly loading

918
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:28,400
Well you know that's a big game that's a real big game yeah that's a big game very complex too yeah this is not the fastest of computers no that's what it is it's the computer yeah blame the computer

919
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:38,400
Linux's fault slow as a dog you know what you gotta do is get yourself that new Sputnik that's got the Thunderbolt on there I have thought about that oh yeah I have

920
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:45,400
Is it on sale yet? No no although you could probably get the Windows version now can't you for some arbitrary reason

921
01:10:45,400 --> 01:11:01,400
I want one of those new 76 systems that are out yeah which one it's the one that's one up from the gazelle I was looking at that one I was like man I need to find a need and justification for me

922
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:20,400
Oh I know right yeah hey look at this look at this yeah that doesn't surprise me using pie game there is a clone of Flappy Bird yeah are you I wonder if this is I wonder if I search the AUR if this is an AUR oh I'm not using Arch on this computer

923
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:32,400
I was gonna say if this is an AUR I'm gonna get it right now huh there's probably a PPA yeah there's probably a PPA
