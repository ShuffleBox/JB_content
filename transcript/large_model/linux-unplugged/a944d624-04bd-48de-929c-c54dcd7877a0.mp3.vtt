WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.700
Has anybody seen this tiny palm phone?

00:02.700 --> 00:05.420
Is that the companion one that goes with your real phone?

00:05.420 --> 00:06.260
Yeah, it's-

00:06.260 --> 00:07.780
I'm so bummed about how they're marketing it.

00:07.780 --> 00:08.620
Why, why?

00:08.620 --> 00:09.440
I think it's a great idea.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.060
You don't need a watch, you need a tiny phone.

00:11.060 --> 00:11.900
Okay, you're right.

00:11.900 --> 00:12.860
That sounds, that sounds dumb.

00:12.860 --> 00:15.180
I want a tiny phone instead of a giant phone.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.500
I just want that to be a thing again.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.180
I miss my small phones.

00:18.180 --> 00:21.660
Cassidy, what you're looking for is the Sony XZ1.

00:21.660 --> 00:25.460
I had a X, a Sony something compact

00:25.460 --> 00:26.300
and it was pretty good.

00:26.300 --> 00:27.120
Oh, that one.

00:27.120 --> 00:27.960
Yeah, yeah.

00:27.960 --> 00:28.780
The compact version.

00:28.780 --> 00:29.620
I just, yeah.

00:29.620 --> 00:30.660
I'm happy that they're doing it.

00:30.660 --> 00:32.420
I just wish more people made small phones.

00:32.420 --> 00:35.180
I wish, I wish that a three and a half inch phone

00:35.180 --> 00:37.060
didn't have to be marketed as a companion.

00:37.060 --> 00:37.900
As a weird thing.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.620
It could be marketed as like a phone.

00:39.620 --> 00:41.380
Well, you know what would legit make me buy this

00:41.380 --> 00:44.340
right now though, is if it ran webOS again.

00:44.340 --> 00:45.500
That would be so amazing.

00:45.500 --> 00:46.340
The good old days.

00:46.340 --> 00:47.180
Yes.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.000
It's weird.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.340
It's like they don't remember the folio that they made

00:50.340 --> 00:52.900
back in the day that was a companion device

00:52.900 --> 00:54.600
that didn't even get released.

00:56.420 --> 00:58.180
How do they think this is going to work?

00:58.180 --> 00:59.980
Also companion devices.

00:59.980 --> 01:03.620
Isn't that a thing from like, you know, 12, 13 years ago?

01:03.620 --> 01:06.180
Can you remember having companions to things?

01:06.180 --> 01:08.460
Isn't Palm a thing from 12 or 13 years ago?

01:10.260 --> 01:15.260
This is Linux Unplugged episode 271 for October 16th, 2018.

01:15.260 --> 01:20.260
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

01:29.660 --> 01:31.420
that's playing high fidelity sound clips

01:31.420 --> 01:33.420
over its Thunderbolt 3 port on Linux.

01:33.420 --> 01:34.240
It's amazing.

01:34.240 --> 01:35.080
My name is Chris.

01:35.080 --> 01:35.900
My name is Wes.

01:35.900 --> 01:36.860
It worked.

01:36.860 --> 01:38.300
That's our first intro.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.580
No problems, no glitches, Linux for the win.

01:40.580 --> 01:44.100
Played live off the ThinkPad as the sound board

01:44.100 --> 01:46.060
over a Thunderbolt 3 connection

01:46.060 --> 01:47.900
into the mixer via sound interface.

01:49.200 --> 01:50.420
Just a proud milestone.

01:50.420 --> 01:51.660
All right, well, that's not what we're here to talk about.

01:51.660 --> 01:52.780
Coming up on this week's episode,

01:52.780 --> 01:54.820
we've got a bunch of community news,

01:54.820 --> 01:57.020
and then we'll ask Dan and Cassidy the hard questions

01:57.020 --> 01:59.260
about elementary OS Juno's new release

01:59.260 --> 02:01.220
that just came out moments ago.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.920
We'll preview this week's Ubuntu 18.10,

02:03.920 --> 02:05.660
chat some hardware with Wimpy,

02:05.660 --> 02:08.540
and then we'll bring Dalton on from Ubuntu Touch

02:08.540 --> 02:12.100
and ask them about the new Ubiport's OTA 5 release.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.640
And then after we're done with that,

02:13.640 --> 02:15.780
we're gonna announce our own free software project,

02:15.780 --> 02:19.140
a modest one, and we need your help naming it.

02:19.140 --> 02:22.580
And I may have found a, quote,

02:22.580 --> 02:26.020
Photoshop alternative, unquote, for Linux.

02:26.020 --> 02:28.540
And I found it in the most unlikely place.

02:28.540 --> 02:32.200
I started trying to get old Photoshop 7 under wine,

02:32.200 --> 02:33.620
couldn't actually find it anywhere

02:33.620 --> 02:34.980
where I could get a valid download,

02:34.980 --> 02:37.580
I mean, backup copy,

02:37.580 --> 02:41.520
wandered off into GIMP and Inkscape and Corita for hours,

02:41.520 --> 02:43.140
and ended up on our app pick this week.

02:43.140 --> 02:45.220
And we'll do a full panel review

02:45.220 --> 02:49.020
of this potential Photoshop replacement for Linux users.

02:49.020 --> 02:50.260
But before we go any further,

02:50.260 --> 02:51.820
we gotta bring in that mumble room.

02:51.820 --> 02:53.820
Time, appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

02:53.820 --> 02:56.100
Hello. Hello.

02:56.100 --> 02:59.400
Whoa, that is, that is, hold on, down periscope.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.420
We gotta look at this.

03:00.420 --> 03:01.940
Brandon's in there, Brent's in there,

03:01.940 --> 03:03.340
Cassidy's in there, Cubicle Nate,

03:03.340 --> 03:08.340
Dan's in there, Mr. Echo, Dave, Eric, Funtalis, hello.

03:09.300 --> 03:12.940
MiniMech, Popey, Sean, TechMav, and Wimpy.

03:12.940 --> 03:13.780
Hello, virtual lug.

03:13.780 --> 03:14.620
A lot of snads.

03:14.620 --> 03:16.820
That is, that's such a long list,

03:16.820 --> 03:17.900
I'm almost gonna have to take a breath

03:17.900 --> 03:19.540
after going through that, that is impressive.

03:19.540 --> 03:20.900
Pace yourself, we've got a huge show.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.440
We have a huge show today.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.140
We are also just doing a little public service announcement

03:25.140 --> 03:26.500
here at the top of the show.

03:26.500 --> 03:27.860
We won't be live next week,

03:27.860 --> 03:29.660
we have a very special feature edition

03:29.660 --> 03:31.140
of the Unplugged program.

03:31.140 --> 03:32.640
We're gonna do a deep dive into a project

03:32.640 --> 03:33.780
we've been working on,

03:33.780 --> 03:35.940
we're gonna bring on the lead developer of PipeWire

03:35.940 --> 03:38.180
and talk about the future of video and audio

03:38.180 --> 03:39.820
and what happens to Pulse Audio,

03:39.820 --> 03:41.420
and all of that next week,

03:41.420 --> 03:44.500
including a review of that crazy high-performance

03:44.500 --> 03:47.020
Dell Precision 5530 laptop.

03:47.020 --> 03:48.580
So we will have an episode for you next week,

03:48.580 --> 03:49.860
but we just will not be live,

03:49.860 --> 03:51.940
because I will be down at MeetBSD,

03:51.940 --> 03:55.940
which is on October 19th and 20th of 2018 in Santa Clara,

03:55.940 --> 03:58.100
at the Intel campus, Wes.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.220
I'm gonna sneak around Intel

03:59.220 --> 04:01.760
and see if I can find the next generation processors.

04:01.760 --> 04:03.100
Make sure it has Linux support now.

04:03.100 --> 04:04.860
That might help them with some of their production issues

04:04.860 --> 04:06.380
too, you know, pretty clever.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.220
That is generous.

04:07.220 --> 04:09.340
Check their benchmarking process whilst you're there.

04:09.340 --> 04:10.900
Yeah, and maybe walk out of there

04:10.900 --> 04:12.620
with the next generation NUC too.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.780
That'd be pretty good.

04:13.780 --> 04:16.060
So yeah, I'll be at MeetBSD next week.

04:16.060 --> 04:16.940
I don't know.

04:16.940 --> 04:19.260
I realized that I'm probably walking into

04:19.260 --> 04:21.460
a whole bunch of Linus jokes, you know?

04:21.460 --> 04:23.100
They're all gonna be cracking about Linus

04:23.100 --> 04:24.540
the whole time I'm down there.

04:24.540 --> 04:26.060
Hey Chris, how's Linus?

04:26.060 --> 04:26.900
You know?

04:26.900 --> 04:28.120
You're gonna have to get a thick skin

04:28.120 --> 04:30.380
just so you can, you know, maintain relations.

04:30.380 --> 04:31.220
That's important.

04:31.220 --> 04:32.060
You're our ambassador there, Chris.

04:32.060 --> 04:33.980
I know, I know, I know.

04:33.980 --> 04:35.980
I'll have to bring like chocolate or something.

04:35.980 --> 04:37.940
I hear the BSD guys like chocolate.

04:37.940 --> 04:39.700
Well, let's get into the community news.

04:39.700 --> 04:42.220
Just a quick one off the top here.

04:42.220 --> 04:44.140
Not only a happy birthday,

04:44.140 --> 04:47.940
a happy 22nd birthday this week to KDE,

04:47.940 --> 04:49.700
but also it seems they've received

04:49.700 --> 04:52.740
a somewhat sizable donation from the Handshake Foundation,

04:52.740 --> 04:55.860
a $300,000 US Greenback donation.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.420
Handshake is pleased to be able to support

04:57.420 --> 04:58.800
KDE's international community

04:58.800 --> 05:00.400
of dedicated volunteers, they write.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.240
That's great for them.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.700
That is great for them.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.500
And 22nd birthday too.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.420
Just, I don't know, a lot of good news these days.

05:07.420 --> 05:09.340
Caligra, by the way, the Caligra Office Week,

05:09.340 --> 05:10.940
which is a great office suite,

05:10.940 --> 05:13.060
is gonna get 100,000 of that.

05:13.060 --> 05:14.780
I can't happen to notice that Gnome

05:14.780 --> 05:18.100
got just a little bit more money from these guys.

05:18.100 --> 05:20.340
I don't know what that's about.

05:20.340 --> 05:22.860
You had to go there.

05:22.860 --> 05:23.700
You had to go there.

05:23.700 --> 05:24.620
I just had to.

05:24.620 --> 05:26.100
Unbelievable, Wes.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.000
Yeah, you're right though, huh?

05:27.000 --> 05:27.840
They did.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.420
But you know what?

05:29.420 --> 05:31.980
Maybe that just means there's less work

05:31.980 --> 05:35.180
that needs to be done on the Plasma side.

05:35.180 --> 05:36.660
I'm trying. Let's go for that, yeah.

05:36.660 --> 05:38.100
That seems plausible.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.700
Yeah, that's awkward.

05:39.700 --> 05:41.340
All right, well let's change gears

05:41.340 --> 05:44.540
and talk about the brand new, fancy,

05:44.540 --> 05:48.820
version five release of elementary OS Juno.

05:48.820 --> 05:52.100
It's here, it's refined, and it's improved.

05:52.100 --> 05:55.380
And Daniel and Cassidy from elementary OS are both here.

05:55.380 --> 05:57.580
Guys, welcome back to the Unplugged program

05:57.580 --> 05:59.660
and congratulations.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.020
Thank you, thanks for having us.

06:01.020 --> 06:02.340
Hey, thanks for having us on.

06:02.340 --> 06:05.140
This seems like maybe one of the releases

06:05.140 --> 06:06.180
you've worked the hardest on.

06:06.180 --> 06:09.420
I don't know, maybe I've been following it a lot closer,

06:09.420 --> 06:12.820
but it really seemed like this one was a lot of effort

06:12.820 --> 06:14.800
and a lot of hustle.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.920
Yeah, it's definitely a huge update.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.980
And I also spent a lot of time actually

06:20.980 --> 06:22.520
documenting everything that's changed,

06:22.520 --> 06:23.700
so that also helps.

06:23.700 --> 06:27.560
Yeah, the post Cassidy is,

06:27.560 --> 06:28.820
it's almost like one of those

06:28.820 --> 06:32.420
John Syracuse-style reviews that was created in-house.

06:32.420 --> 06:34.820
I love it actually, it's really in-depth.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.860
What system did you use?

06:36.860 --> 06:38.340
Is this a text file to track all of this

06:38.340 --> 06:41.980
or is there actually a system you used to track all this?

06:41.980 --> 06:43.900
Yeah, I don't know, I mean, GitHub mostly,

06:43.900 --> 06:45.860
like just following along.

06:45.860 --> 06:48.420
Yeah, cause we use a milestone planning on GitHub,

06:48.420 --> 06:52.700
so we can check each milestone along the way

06:52.700 --> 06:55.180
and see what all issues and pull requests were submitted.

06:55.180 --> 06:56.460
So that helped a lot.

06:56.460 --> 06:59.460
Yeah, so I want to just ask you guys

06:59.460 --> 07:01.860
both a couple of questions that have been kind of lingering

07:01.860 --> 07:03.060
in the back of my mind

07:03.060 --> 07:05.300
with the release of Juno on the way.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.020
I think I wanted to start with

07:07.980 --> 07:09.860
the developer side of the story.

07:09.860 --> 07:11.620
So I think one of the things that you've gained

07:11.620 --> 07:13.900
the most traction for recently is the App Center,

07:13.900 --> 07:16.400
the pay what you want model has been interesting to watch.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.020
There is some really good updates in Juno

07:19.020 --> 07:22.300
where you can try the app before you buy it

07:22.300 --> 07:23.540
and then be reminded to purchase it.

07:23.540 --> 07:25.140
I think that's an interesting take

07:25.140 --> 07:26.940
on that particular problem.

07:26.940 --> 07:29.580
I don't know if this is a Dan or a Cassidy question,

07:29.580 --> 07:32.100
but I'm curious what the back channel communication

07:32.100 --> 07:34.260
is like between you and the developers

07:34.260 --> 07:35.780
that are creating these apps.

07:35.780 --> 07:39.460
And in addition to that, how much expectation you have

07:39.460 --> 07:41.340
that they'll be updated for Juno now?

07:41.340 --> 07:44.060
So there's a lot of developers that actually hang out

07:44.060 --> 07:46.880
in our community Slack, which is super helpful.

07:46.880 --> 07:49.220
So they've kind of formed their own community there.

07:49.220 --> 07:51.800
And then it's easy for us to jump in

07:51.800 --> 07:54.420
and talk to them really quickly that way.

07:54.420 --> 07:58.040
We also have a Gitter channel that some people are using,

07:58.040 --> 08:02.800
but we've used a GitHub issues a lot actually

08:02.800 --> 08:05.160
during this release to give people information

08:05.160 --> 08:06.600
and let them know like how they can update

08:06.600 --> 08:07.860
their applications.

08:07.860 --> 08:12.860
And as of release time out of the over 100 applications

08:14.280 --> 08:17.560
that are available total, 75 of those

08:17.560 --> 08:19.040
have been ported to Juno so far.

08:19.040 --> 08:24.040
Whoa, whoa, that is significantly more than I would expect.

08:24.120 --> 08:24.960
That's awesome.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.880
And that shows some excitement in the development community.

08:26.880 --> 08:30.600
So it seems like there is some actual momentum there too.

08:30.600 --> 08:32.680
That's great, congratulations guys.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.200
I think the other thing, just thinking about things

08:35.200 --> 08:37.660
that have really shifted since your last release,

08:37.660 --> 08:40.820
because you guys are not really on the same release cadence

08:40.820 --> 08:41.700
that anybody else is.

08:41.700 --> 08:45.400
And so some significant things have shifted in the community

08:45.400 --> 08:46.440
since your last release.

08:46.440 --> 08:49.680
And I think maybe one of the more significant ones

08:49.680 --> 08:52.320
for your projects and totally correct me if I'm wrong,

08:52.320 --> 08:56.440
is the conversation around it's a Mac OS rip off,

08:56.440 --> 08:57.840
it's a Mac OS clone.

08:57.840 --> 09:01.320
And I think it has transitioned to,

09:01.320 --> 09:03.760
it's an elegant, well-designed desktop,

09:04.760 --> 09:06.480
and it's a workstation desktop.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.200
And it's not just for new users,

09:08.200 --> 09:09.680
but it can work really well for new users.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.800
So that's, I think, and do you agree with that assessment?

09:12.800 --> 09:14.880
Yeah, I mean, I think there's a lot more new ones now.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.720
There's a little more sense of purpose and place

09:16.720 --> 09:18.640
within the great array of distros.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.440
You still got your ankle biters who are still,

09:20.440 --> 09:23.000
ah, it's a Mac rip off, who don't really pay any attention

09:23.000 --> 09:24.680
and don't look into it.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.440
But I think for the most part, the conversation has shifted.

09:27.440 --> 09:29.760
My buddy from Coder Radio, Michael Dominic,

09:29.760 --> 09:31.240
is moving over to using it

09:31.240 --> 09:33.320
as his primary day-to-day development platform.

09:33.320 --> 09:34.160
That's awesome.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.400
Yeah, he finds it to be a nice, clean, elegant,

09:36.400 --> 09:40.080
get out of his way, just work the way he wants.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.360
And that's a pretty big shift of tone.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.280
That's a big shadow for a project

09:44.280 --> 09:46.280
to crawl out from underneath.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.680
And I don't know if you completely agree with me,

09:47.680 --> 09:49.600
but I'm curious if you guys have a sense

09:49.600 --> 09:51.880
of what the next conversation is,

09:51.880 --> 09:54.120
what the next statement is that the project needs to make.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.920
Like, what's the next hurdle communication-wise,

09:56.920 --> 09:59.040
community perception-wise that you see?

09:59.040 --> 10:03.720
Hmm, yeah, I mean, I think focusing on privacy

10:03.720 --> 10:05.240
is always a really big,

10:06.560 --> 10:08.120
it's always been a big focus for us,

10:08.120 --> 10:09.280
but we're paying more attention

10:09.280 --> 10:11.040
to actually actively talking about it

10:11.040 --> 10:13.920
and kind of making that be a bigger conversation

10:13.920 --> 10:18.680
because as we see more cloud services,

10:18.680 --> 10:21.320
as we see more, even desktop operating systems

10:21.320 --> 10:24.560
be more invasive in your privacy,

10:24.560 --> 10:26.280
like that's super important to us

10:26.280 --> 10:27.440
that we don't do any of that.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.560
So I think that's probably one of the biggest focuses

10:29.560 --> 10:30.400
coming up.

10:30.400 --> 10:34.680
Hmm, I'm curious too, along those lines,

10:34.680 --> 10:37.120
is there cross-pollination work

10:37.120 --> 10:38.480
with some of the stuff you've been doing,

10:38.480 --> 10:41.400
System 76, that's gonna show up down the road too?

10:41.400 --> 10:42.520
Like the installer?

10:42.520 --> 10:45.400
Yeah, so I mean, the installer we helped,

10:45.400 --> 10:47.560
we designed and helped develop the front end for,

10:47.560 --> 10:49.760
and Pop!OS is currently shipping that,

10:49.760 --> 10:54.200
and yeah, there's been this secure by default series,

10:54.200 --> 10:55.720
I guess, of posts that I've written

10:55.720 --> 10:57.400
and that we've been talking about,

10:57.400 --> 10:59.320
and encryption by default is a big part of that,

10:59.320 --> 11:01.760
and that's something that the installer lets us do.

11:01.760 --> 11:02.760
We're not currently shipping it

11:02.760 --> 11:04.800
because there's actually other pieces of the stack

11:04.800 --> 11:08.240
we have to develop to be able to do that,

11:08.240 --> 11:10.040
like initial setup.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.600
We don't use GNOME initial setup

11:11.600 --> 11:13.840
because it has a lot of GNOME dependencies.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.960
So there's still some work that we have to do,

11:16.960 --> 11:19.200
but yeah, getting secure and privacy by default

11:19.200 --> 11:20.360
is a really big deal.

11:20.360 --> 11:21.200
I like that.

11:21.200 --> 11:22.040
I think that's really cool,

11:22.040 --> 11:24.360
and I'd be a pretty happy camper

11:24.360 --> 11:28.400
to see the home encryption land by default.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.440
I gotta kind of be honest with you guys,

11:30.440 --> 11:32.960
the installer, although it's a great installer,

11:32.960 --> 11:34.920
a bunch of guys, don't get me wrong,

11:34.920 --> 11:37.880
the installer does sort of feel a little out of place

11:37.880 --> 11:40.460
on the desktop now because the rest of it is,

11:41.920 --> 11:44.240
there's such a clear design language on the rest of it,

11:44.240 --> 11:46.000
and the installer doesn't quite follow it,

11:46.000 --> 11:46.960
and the style sheet, I don't know,

11:46.960 --> 11:49.560
it doesn't quite look right to me on that installer.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.880
And so I think that for the next release

11:51.880 --> 11:53.920
would be a really nice piece to replace

11:53.920 --> 11:55.240
if everything's ready.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.120
Exactly, yeah, the current plan is

11:57.120 --> 11:59.480
that could be a big feature for 5.1 hopefully,

11:59.480 --> 12:02.040
so that's definitely a focus.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.960
Now, I'll tell you something else while we're in this area

12:04.960 --> 12:07.240
that would be, I think, helpful for adoption,

12:07.240 --> 12:09.240
although I understand it's a really hard problem,

12:09.240 --> 12:14.240
is something to make it a little more testable under VMs.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.360
And I think it was good, like, when you guys sent out

12:16.360 --> 12:18.080
an email to some of us to review it,

12:18.080 --> 12:21.120
you said, by the way, it doesn't work perfectly in VMs,

12:21.120 --> 12:24.320
there's some things that don't render quite right.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.280
Why is that?

12:25.280 --> 12:27.480
And is there any potential of one day fixing it

12:27.480 --> 12:30.560
so that way people that just want to try it

12:30.560 --> 12:32.800
on their machine under a VM can give it a go?

12:32.800 --> 12:36.040
Yeah, so the thing with that is a lot more

12:36.040 --> 12:38.880
of kind of the underlying stack.

12:38.880 --> 12:40.960
The desktop environment does require

12:40.960 --> 12:43.920
some hardware acceleration for animations

12:43.920 --> 12:44.760
and things like that.

12:44.760 --> 12:45.680
And it looks great too.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.600
Yeah, the way that GTK handles the fallback

12:48.600 --> 12:51.920
when animations are disabled can sometimes mean

12:51.920 --> 12:54.360
that you have extra spaces where things are supposed

12:54.360 --> 12:57.640
to be slide out revealed and things like that.

12:57.640 --> 13:02.000
So that might be fixed in the future stack

13:02.000 --> 13:06.240
with upcoming technologies like Vulkan, Wayland, GTK4.

13:06.240 --> 13:10.640
Who knows, that might be improved on that place.

13:10.640 --> 13:14.120
But for us, I think a lot of those issues

13:14.120 --> 13:16.280
are more in the underlying technology.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.600
Yeah, I thought that might be the case.

13:18.600 --> 13:23.600
If I may, you'll remember that Ubuntu

13:24.480 --> 13:27.560
is now collecting hardware metrics

13:27.560 --> 13:30.800
for people that want to share that information.

13:30.800 --> 13:34.240
And we've learned that there is a large proportion

13:34.240 --> 13:39.120
of users installing the Ubuntu desktop on virtual machines.

13:39.120 --> 13:42.400
And I know that Will Cook has a vested interest

13:42.400 --> 13:46.040
in improving that experience and working upstream

13:46.040 --> 13:48.520
to land the necessary performance improvements

13:48.520 --> 13:52.120
and fixes to make the VM experience just generally better.

13:52.120 --> 13:56.240
So I think that's something that will improve in time.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.440
Yeah, that would be awesome.

13:57.440 --> 14:00.280
I know it might also be more obvious in elementary OS

14:00.280 --> 14:03.800
because we use a lot of animation and a lot of GTK revealers

14:03.800 --> 14:05.160
which are those little animated things

14:05.160 --> 14:07.840
that kind of collapse down or expand open.

14:07.840 --> 14:10.480
So it might just be more obvious in elementary OS

14:10.480 --> 14:12.480
than other desktops because of the types of widgets

14:12.480 --> 14:13.320
that we use.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.760
But yeah, getting all those fixes upstream,

14:14.760 --> 14:15.600
that would be great.

14:15.600 --> 14:16.440
Thanks, Wimpy.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.080
Yeah, it would be as nice for me to be able to do test drives

14:19.080 --> 14:22.040
but I do totally understand that there's a certain experience

14:22.040 --> 14:23.840
you're trying to achieve on a modern desktop.

14:23.840 --> 14:26.120
A lot of desktops just don't perform their best under VM.

14:26.120 --> 14:29.240
So that's not an unusual thing either.

14:29.240 --> 14:31.160
There's a few others that I always like to catch up

14:31.160 --> 14:32.120
on you guys with.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.800
Also requested by my co-host, Michael Dominic,

14:35.800 --> 14:38.200
was he was hoping for the elevator pitch

14:38.200 --> 14:41.480
on why somebody looking to target elementary OS

14:41.480 --> 14:43.160
should bother learning Vala.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.560
Yeah, it's really about,

14:44.560 --> 14:46.000
and we actually gave a talk about this recently

14:46.000 --> 14:48.040
at the Libre application summit.

14:48.040 --> 14:52.440
It's really about having the one true developer path of,

14:52.440 --> 14:57.400
Vala was created by Gnome for GTK and G-stack development.

14:57.400 --> 15:01.040
And so that's what we use and it works really well for that

15:01.040 --> 15:06.040
using, it's tailor-made for our stack.

15:06.040 --> 15:09.440
And really it's less important about which exact language

15:09.440 --> 15:11.000
we choose.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.160
It's more about the fact that we have a specific language

15:14.160 --> 15:15.880
that we recommend people to use.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.280
It's also just a really great, easy to understand language.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.280
It's pretty simple to read.

15:20.280 --> 15:23.760
It's, if you've come from other languages like C-sharp,

15:23.760 --> 15:26.800
it's, or Java even, it's really similar.

15:26.800 --> 15:31.800
So it's more about the ecosystem of development around that.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.800
So there's the documentation,

15:35.800 --> 15:37.720
there's the community of other developers

15:37.720 --> 15:40.760
who are writing open source code using that one language.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.080
It just makes this whole big development ecosystem

15:43.080 --> 15:43.960
a lot better.

15:43.960 --> 15:45.240
That makes perfect sense.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.200
I always liked that answer.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.560
I think that's really a solid reason.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.960
And we see it on other platforms that are doing well,

15:49.960 --> 15:51.360
right, they do that.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.720
Now, Cassidy, this is the first release,

15:53.720 --> 15:55.840
the first major release since you've been a full-time

15:55.840 --> 15:58.280
employee, how's that working out for you so far?

15:58.280 --> 15:59.200
It's so great.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.040
Is it?

16:00.040 --> 16:00.880
It's so good.

16:00.880 --> 16:01.720
Yeah, I love it.

16:01.720 --> 16:02.560
Good, I'm glad to hear that.

16:02.560 --> 16:03.600
It's so cool.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.880
Yeah, I've been able to spend a lot of time

16:04.880 --> 16:06.440
doing a lot of the stuff I really love,

16:06.440 --> 16:08.280
like both development and design work,

16:08.280 --> 16:13.120
but also things like writing a 7,000 word release post

16:13.120 --> 16:15.520
about it and taking all the really great screenshots

16:15.520 --> 16:16.360
and stuff.

16:16.360 --> 16:17.600
So it's been a really great deal.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.360
I think too, it's worth mentioning,

16:19.360 --> 16:21.880
because you guys don't get a lot of credit for this,

16:21.880 --> 16:25.280
that what appears to be a pretty polished set of,

16:25.280 --> 16:27.840
I mean polished is not even doing it justice,

16:27.840 --> 16:31.840
an extensive encyclopedic set of release notes.

16:31.840 --> 16:35.120
Honestly, if I was a super fan of this OS

16:35.120 --> 16:36.880
and I had been waiting and waiting and watching

16:36.880 --> 16:38.640
the countdown, to be able to read through this

16:38.640 --> 16:39.920
would be very rewarding.

16:39.920 --> 16:43.520
And it's, of course, like everything you guys do,

16:43.520 --> 16:45.920
it itself is well laid out and well formatted

16:45.920 --> 16:49.760
with great visuals, the prettiest screenshots

16:49.760 --> 16:51.000
on the internet.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.160
And I like the way you do this because it allows the reader

16:55.160 --> 17:00.040
to just appreciate and examine that element of the UI.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.880
And this also extends into the press kit

17:02.880 --> 17:06.960
that they send out to some folks that sign up for it.

17:06.960 --> 17:12.640
And in there is also like a resource of screenshots

17:12.640 --> 17:15.040
where they'll zoom in on a particular element of the UI.

17:15.040 --> 17:16.480
So you can sit there and really kind of appreciate

17:16.480 --> 17:17.240
how well it's thought out.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.880
Because when you see it on your screen with three or four

17:19.880 --> 17:22.520
other windows and the toolbar and the dock,

17:22.520 --> 17:24.440
it's sort of just one of the many details.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.800
But when you take these applications

17:25.800 --> 17:28.600
that are on elementary OS and you isolate components

17:28.600 --> 17:31.920
of their interface, you can appreciate really

17:31.920 --> 17:33.240
how well designed there are.

17:33.240 --> 17:36.600
And this press kit is just really, really well done

17:36.600 --> 17:39.880
with cautions about the VM and other explanations in there

17:39.880 --> 17:41.080
about the features.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.600
And so from end to end, this has felt

17:43.600 --> 17:45.920
like one of the most professional releases

17:45.920 --> 17:49.200
of a software product, not of a Linux distribution,

17:49.200 --> 17:53.560
not of an open source project, but of a software product.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.200
And I think you guys have nailed it

17:55.200 --> 17:59.640
at a level of professionalism that is up.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.720
It's rare for the industry in general.

18:01.720 --> 18:05.800
So my hat's off on the back end organization and effort

18:05.800 --> 18:07.160
for the Juno release.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.480
It's exceptional.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.360
Thank you so much.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.880
Yeah, that's awesome to hear.

18:10.880 --> 18:14.160
Well, guys, just to make everything easy in our show

18:14.160 --> 18:16.480
notes, we've direct linked to the ISOs.

18:16.480 --> 18:20.400
So that way, people can just bypass the website all together.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.720
Just kidding, of course.

18:22.720 --> 18:25.320
I saw your tweet to DistroWatch this morning,

18:25.320 --> 18:27.680
and I thought, oh, what are they doing?

18:27.680 --> 18:28.480
What are they doing?

18:28.480 --> 18:31.640
Of course, elementary OS is a crowdfunded effort.

18:31.640 --> 18:33.400
And there's multiple ways you can do that.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.600
And one of the options is to kick them a few bucks

18:35.600 --> 18:37.240
when you go download the ISO.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.160
And even if it's just something you try out,

18:39.160 --> 18:40.960
I think it's worth kicking them a few bucks

18:40.960 --> 18:43.400
because they're doing something nobody else is doing,

18:43.400 --> 18:45.840
and they're doing it really well.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.280
That's a new standard, I think.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.440
Yeah, on a lot of fronts, on how you communicate

18:49.440 --> 18:51.800
with developers, on how they should build tools,

18:51.800 --> 18:53.600
on how to distribute applications

18:53.600 --> 18:56.720
for your platform, how they can monetize those applications.

18:56.720 --> 19:00.200
They're literally one of the few app centers or app stores

19:00.200 --> 19:03.880
in the entire market that has figured out a way to do demos.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.640
I don't know why Apple and Google and Microsoft

19:06.640 --> 19:08.880
haven't been able to figure out this system, but somehow,

19:08.880 --> 19:11.360
these guys over at elementary OS figured it out.

19:11.360 --> 19:14.040
Plus, the whole thing is exceptionally well-designed,

19:14.040 --> 19:15.880
and they've been doing this for a while now.

19:15.880 --> 19:20.760
So this is multiple releases in, and it deserves that 5.0.

19:20.760 --> 19:21.480
It really does.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.520
I think it deserves that 5.0 number.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.320
And I just think it's a great release.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.520
So even if you don't stick with it,

19:26.520 --> 19:28.240
I think it's worth kicking them a few bucks.

19:28.240 --> 19:28.960
So go check it out.

19:28.960 --> 19:32.240
We will have links to the website and the announcement

19:32.240 --> 19:33.040
in the show notes.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.360
Congratulations, guys.

19:34.360 --> 19:34.920
Good release.

19:34.920 --> 19:35.440
Thank you.

19:35.440 --> 19:37.400
I hope you guys get some rest.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.760
And as long as you get all the bugs fixed,

19:38.760 --> 19:40.000
the people report right away.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.760
Hey, and if you want to go get more Dan

19:43.760 --> 19:46.760
and maybe understand the hype around the Plasma desktop

19:46.760 --> 19:49.200
or hear Dan's thoughts on it, which, again, was another.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.160
I thought that was really well done, too.

19:51.160 --> 19:55.360
Dan did an analysis of some of the UI quirks of Plasma

19:55.360 --> 19:56.440
that bother him.

19:56.440 --> 20:00.760
And Popi offered a really solid rebuttal to a lot of it.

20:00.760 --> 20:02.880
And the conversation, I thought, was great,

20:02.880 --> 20:04.600
especially as a Plasma user.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.240
And it was in user error 50.

20:06.240 --> 20:09.400
You can check it out at error.show slash 50.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.720
That's error, not air.

20:10.720 --> 20:15.480
Error.show slash 50, where they break down all the Plasma hype,

20:15.480 --> 20:19.160
as well as a few great hashtag ask air questions

20:19.160 --> 20:20.960
and some heavy topics.

20:20.960 --> 20:24.000
Oh, yeah, it's a wild episode, that one, but great.

20:24.000 --> 20:24.680
That's good.

20:24.680 --> 20:27.200
I got an email into the show from listener Alan with an E.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.160
He says, love the show.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.160
It's now my number one go-to for all the Linux things.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.560
I have a question that I'm hoping you can answer for me.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.600
I'm fairly new to the Linux community.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.640
And recently, I saw a website that's

20:36.640 --> 20:39.360
come out saying that Flatpak is a security risk

20:39.360 --> 20:40.840
and shouldn't be used.

20:40.840 --> 20:43.160
I've heard it referenced on your show a few times,

20:43.160 --> 20:45.280
and it seems like it's a way to install software.

20:45.280 --> 20:49.120
I was wondering if you could alleviate some confusion,

20:49.120 --> 20:52.280
or should I discontinue the use of Flatpaks?

20:52.280 --> 20:54.640
Is this an internet hoax or a security risk?

20:54.640 --> 20:55.520
Alan.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.240
That's honestly a pretty good question.

20:57.240 --> 20:58.760
There's been a lot of things up in the air,

20:58.760 --> 21:00.120
and if you don't really understand the technology,

21:00.120 --> 21:02.320
if you're not using it, or you haven't looked at the source

21:02.320 --> 21:04.000
code behind it, how could you know?

21:04.000 --> 21:06.800
Yeah, a website recently came out, flatkill.org,

21:06.800 --> 21:10.000
where it went after Flatpaks for inadequate sandboxing

21:10.000 --> 21:12.840
practices and shipping out-of-date libraries.

21:12.840 --> 21:14.800
The author, which is a really common mistake,

21:14.800 --> 21:19.000
though, attributed these flaws to Flatpaks themselves.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.320
Instead of how the developers have packaged them,

21:21.320 --> 21:24.440
as if this developer, or as if this author of the blog post

21:24.440 --> 21:28.480
was unaware that this is how maybe potentially hundreds

21:28.480 --> 21:30.080
of thousands of Docker images ship,

21:30.080 --> 21:33.720
this is how some packages are in the Debian repo right now.

21:33.720 --> 21:35.920
This is not a new problem to software.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.380
This has been a problem with software for a long time,

21:38.380 --> 21:40.820
and this is, I believe, made worse

21:40.820 --> 21:43.520
when you have volunteers packaging the software instead

21:43.520 --> 21:48.280
of the developers directly packaging it themselves.

21:48.280 --> 21:52.960
So Flatkill takes off, goes all over the typical places,

21:52.960 --> 21:57.800
and I just saw people shitting on the Flatpak concept

21:57.800 --> 22:00.220
and on SNAP packages.

22:00.220 --> 22:04.940
And I can't believe on October 16 of 2008,

22:04.940 --> 22:07.640
we have to have a minute where Chris explains the reason we

22:07.640 --> 22:09.600
need universal packaging.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.000
I can't believe that people still don't get this.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.080
And I think it's because everybody is so self-obsessed

22:15.080 --> 22:17.400
that they can't figure that there could be problems out

22:17.400 --> 22:19.160
there that they've never witnessed.

22:19.160 --> 22:22.040
And they have no ability to empathize with anybody else

22:22.040 --> 22:23.120
on the internet, it appears.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.980
I mean, I'm just projecting a bit here,

22:24.980 --> 22:26.360
but it seems to be the case.

22:26.360 --> 22:29.340
Experience holds up.

22:29.340 --> 22:32.720
Besides sandboxing, which is a nice aspect,

22:32.720 --> 22:36.920
if you configure it correctly, of Flatpaks, or isolation,

22:36.920 --> 22:40.880
whatever you want to call it, even if you just look at that,

22:40.880 --> 22:43.000
that itself is a nice improvement.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.600
But creating an API system, creating a portal system

22:46.600 --> 22:48.480
for Wayland, that way you can get access

22:48.480 --> 22:50.400
in Wayland environments where everything is sandboxed,

22:50.400 --> 22:52.840
that way you can get access to hardware and devices.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.280
This is all necessary.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.320
And you can't just say because you have a sandbox,

22:56.320 --> 22:58.360
then you have 100% security anyways.

22:58.360 --> 23:01.000
Security is a multi-layered thing.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.920
You don't just put locks on your doors,

23:02.920 --> 23:05.880
you also put locks on your windows, right?

23:05.880 --> 23:10.720
Because security is many things, and sandboxing is a component.

23:10.720 --> 23:13.160
And if one of those many things is bogus,

23:13.160 --> 23:15.280
that doesn't mean the entire thing is bogus,

23:15.280 --> 23:18.000
especially if it's not an implementation,

23:18.000 --> 23:20.360
or especially if it is an implementation detail,

23:20.360 --> 23:23.160
and it's not like a core fundamental flaw with Flatpaks.

23:23.160 --> 23:26.200
But let's talk about Flatpaks and the specific desktop app

23:26.200 --> 23:27.040
problem space.

23:27.040 --> 23:29.040
Because really, I think when we think about this,

23:29.040 --> 23:30.200
we think about the servers.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.160
But the security position on the desktop to begin with

23:33.160 --> 23:34.480
is horrible.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.080
Anything in your session basically

23:36.080 --> 23:37.760
has complete access to everything

23:37.760 --> 23:39.800
belonging to your user.

23:39.800 --> 23:43.640
Think about the way an X11 system traditionally works.

23:43.640 --> 23:47.000
Even with these limitations on a traditional Linux desktop,

23:47.000 --> 23:51.400
Flatpaks still brings security, like default sandboxing,

23:51.400 --> 23:52.680
IPC filtering.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.840
A new file system too, don't forget that process,

23:54.840 --> 23:57.560
and UID namespacing, sitcom filtering,

23:57.560 --> 24:00.960
and an immutable user and app directory.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.480
I think it's also worth highlighting

24:02.480 --> 24:04.880
some of the other reasons why Flatpak exists at all

24:04.880 --> 24:07.200
to begin with, or why other universal packaging formats

24:07.200 --> 24:08.240
do.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.480
It allows apps to become agnostic

24:10.480 --> 24:12.280
of their underlying distribution.

24:12.280 --> 24:14.520
So you can have something that maybe

24:14.520 --> 24:17.240
has dependencies on GTK2.

24:17.240 --> 24:19.920
And you don't have to have GTK2 installed system-wide

24:19.920 --> 24:20.200
to run that.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.760
Don't worry that suddenly you won't be able to update anymore

24:21.760 --> 24:24.040
because you broke your package manager.

24:24.040 --> 24:25.000
That's right.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.480
Also, you're separating the release update cadence

24:27.480 --> 24:30.560
of the distribution from the application.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.160
This is a point that we heard from Frank of OwnCloud

24:33.160 --> 24:35.600
and now NextCloud over and over again,

24:35.600 --> 24:40.160
that old, vulnerable versions of their PHP-based application

24:40.160 --> 24:42.640
were still being shipped in the distro repositories

24:42.640 --> 24:45.680
while they had brand new ones available for download

24:45.680 --> 24:47.400
off their website.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.880
The issue is the distribution doesn't

24:48.880 --> 24:52.680
update the repos as often as NextCloud updates.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.840
But if they're shipping them as a universal application,

24:54.840 --> 24:59.320
like a snap, they can update the snap when they want.

24:59.320 --> 25:03.840
It also disintermediates the app developers from the users

25:03.840 --> 25:05.400
when you have it that way.

25:05.400 --> 25:09.000
When you have the distribution in control of the software,

25:09.000 --> 25:12.920
then the developer really is disconnected completely

25:12.920 --> 25:14.440
from the end user.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.280
The developer doesn't really have any idea

25:16.280 --> 25:18.240
of how many installs under Linux they are.

25:18.240 --> 25:19.840
We've heard this from LibreOffice.

25:19.840 --> 25:23.760
They say, yeah, we have a few numbers from our website

25:23.760 --> 25:25.040
and a few mirrors.

25:25.040 --> 25:28.080
But if users install LibreOffice from the distros,

25:28.080 --> 25:30.200
we really don't have any idea of how many installs

25:30.200 --> 25:31.520
we have out there on Linux.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.920
So we don't know where to weigh it, necessarily,

25:33.920 --> 25:35.240
because not all of it checks in.

25:35.240 --> 25:39.520
Not all of it is being pulled from our servers.

25:39.520 --> 25:44.640
And it decentralizes the distribution of applications.

25:44.640 --> 25:48.720
If you can distribute something like Plex server as a snap,

25:48.720 --> 25:52.880
it is not an Ubuntu-specific thing that has now happened.

25:52.880 --> 25:55.680
Last week, Plex announced that the Plex server is now

25:55.680 --> 25:56.920
available as a snap.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.560
It's in the beta channel right now.

25:58.560 --> 25:59.960
It's a beta version of Plex server.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.840
And you can install it from a snap

26:02.840 --> 26:05.240
and have Plex installed and ready to go.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.080
That's incredible.

26:07.080 --> 26:10.040
And it's not an Ubuntu-specific thing.

26:10.040 --> 26:12.640
Canonical did the legwork with the relationship

26:12.640 --> 26:14.880
to help them make that happen.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.040
And in the past, before this kind of thing,

26:17.040 --> 26:19.960
it would have been an Ubuntu-only technology.

26:19.960 --> 26:21.520
It would have been a PPA or a DEB.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.240
The people would have had to have guides

26:23.240 --> 26:25.720
to get working on Arch and get working on Fedora.

26:25.720 --> 26:27.920
And now it is a frickin' snap.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.240
It's not an Ubuntu repo.

26:31.240 --> 26:35.440
And the same thing is true with Flatpaks and App Images.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.480
It's not like Flatpaks are perfect,

26:37.480 --> 26:39.600
but they solve problems.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.000
Same with snaps, same with App Images.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.360
And the crap on the concept is to pretend

26:44.360 --> 26:46.440
like the existing way to distribute software on Linux

26:46.440 --> 26:47.280
has been sufficient.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.080
It has not been.

26:48.080 --> 26:51.080
We wouldn't be having this conversation if it had been.

26:51.080 --> 26:54.640
And it's anti-intellectual to blame the core technology

26:54.640 --> 26:56.600
for the developers' bad actions.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.960
I think it's frustrating with the tone, too, right?

26:58.960 --> 27:00.520
Because as you just said, Flatpak

27:00.520 --> 27:02.480
isn't perfect, but it's a progression.

27:02.480 --> 27:03.400
We're trying to get better.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.280
We're trying to have more options for sandboxing,

27:05.280 --> 27:08.240
for understanding what resources an application might need

27:08.240 --> 27:11.080
and it should be allowed to have on your computer.

27:11.080 --> 27:12.640
And yes, you can do that poorly.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.360
You can not implement sandboxing.

27:14.360 --> 27:15.920
You can leave things too open,

27:15.920 --> 27:17.160
and we should be aware of that.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.000
We should be aware that, yes,

27:18.000 --> 27:20.440
when you do ship all your dependencies bundled together,

27:20.440 --> 27:21.560
sometimes they don't get updated.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.360
But that's already a problem in these platforms,

27:23.360 --> 27:24.880
and we should talk about it,

27:24.880 --> 27:26.480
but we don't need to throw the whole thing out.

27:26.480 --> 27:30.840
How many Windows systems have old DLLs that get sprayed

27:30.840 --> 27:32.480
onto their hard drive when you run the install wizard?

27:32.480 --> 27:33.520
Or all Macs ever.

27:33.520 --> 27:36.320
DMG files that probably ship with old libraries in them.

27:36.320 --> 27:37.640
I'm curious what Popey thinks, though,

27:37.640 --> 27:40.320
about my wild assertion that this is going to be

27:40.320 --> 27:44.360
more of a problem whenever you have volunteer-curated

27:44.360 --> 27:47.560
Flatpaks or Snaps, and that it really kind of relies

27:47.560 --> 27:50.680
on the software shop to integrate the packaging

27:50.680 --> 27:52.280
into their production pipeline.

27:52.280 --> 27:54.840
Well, first of all, I'd say it's really unfortunate

27:54.840 --> 27:58.160
that the person who had issues with Flatpak

27:58.160 --> 28:02.720
decided to create a website and an ill-informed bit of copy

28:02.720 --> 28:06.160
on a webpage and try and brand it as some security nightmare.

28:06.160 --> 28:09.080
I think that's really not the way to go.

28:09.080 --> 28:12.040
If you want, you can engage with the developers

28:12.040 --> 28:16.000
and talk to them about the issues you have.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.240
Supply code is the absolutely best way to go,

28:18.240 --> 28:21.200
but otherwise, supply bugs or test cases

28:21.200 --> 28:24.440
to prove the things you're trying to illustrate are wrong.

28:24.440 --> 28:25.840
But I think the way they went about it

28:25.840 --> 28:27.240
was just completely wrong.

28:27.240 --> 28:30.080
And it really stirred up the whole sentiment

28:30.080 --> 28:32.080
against some of these package systems

28:32.080 --> 28:34.240
which are trying to solve problems.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.080
I agree.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.920
As you say, all of them are trying to solve

28:37.920 --> 28:40.160
similar problems in different ways,

28:40.160 --> 28:43.080
and this just wasn't really helpful at all.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.760
100% agree with you.

28:44.760 --> 28:45.760
You nailed it.

28:45.760 --> 28:48.200
Now, my question, though, is do you think that,

28:48.200 --> 28:51.960
I mean, the one fundamental truth that we could find in here

28:51.960 --> 28:56.960
is developers may lackadaisically configure

28:57.160 --> 28:58.680
their sandbox requirement,

28:58.680 --> 29:01.320
and GNOME software could do a better job

29:01.320 --> 29:03.920
of alerting users of weak sandboxes.

29:03.920 --> 29:07.600
I installed a snap today via Discover on the latest Plasma,

29:07.600 --> 29:10.080
and I actually got a warning that it was an unconfined snap,

29:10.080 --> 29:11.960
and it asked me if I was okay continuing.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.440
See, that's slick, yeah.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.280
You should be asked.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.640
That's how it should work.

29:15.640 --> 29:16.480
Right.

29:16.480 --> 29:19.000
So there's some obvious areas for improvement,

29:19.000 --> 29:22.080
or not packaging really old libraries or failing

29:22.080 --> 29:24.680
to update them, which seems like that is a volunteer issue.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.200
There's a lot of things that need to catch up.

29:26.200 --> 29:30.400
It's, you know, the guys who are working on Flat Hub

29:30.400 --> 29:34.240
and AppImage and SnapD and all these other technologies,

29:34.240 --> 29:36.360
there's a whole lot of legacy that they're trying

29:36.360 --> 29:38.800
to drag through into the 21st century,

29:38.800 --> 29:41.280
and some of that is some of the software stores

29:41.280 --> 29:43.920
don't understand the concept of confinement,

29:43.920 --> 29:47.680
and so they need to know how to present to the user

29:47.680 --> 29:51.200
and make it possible for the user to make those decisions,

29:51.200 --> 29:55.080
like whether that's in badges or little verified ticks

29:55.080 --> 29:56.680
or however that's represented to the user

29:56.680 --> 29:58.840
so the user can make an informed decision

29:58.840 --> 30:01.800
exactly the same way as you do on your mobile phone.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.320
You go into the Android store, you start looking at reviews,

30:05.320 --> 30:07.480
you look at how many downloads this thing has.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.840
Does it look like it's come from a reputable developer,

30:09.840 --> 30:12.520
or is this like Mr. Joe Smith in, you know,

30:12.520 --> 30:14.560
some random country in Middle Asia?

30:14.560 --> 30:18.600
Like, you need to empower users with the ability

30:18.600 --> 30:20.720
to make decisions to control their own computer

30:20.720 --> 30:23.240
and control what software they put on their computer,

30:23.240 --> 30:24.800
and that's what we're trying to do.

30:24.800 --> 30:27.280
We're trying to make it easier for users

30:27.280 --> 30:30.280
to make those decisions, and sometimes,

30:30.280 --> 30:31.280
we're not quite there.

30:31.280 --> 30:33.920
Things like GNOME software doesn't quite present

30:33.920 --> 30:36.520
the information we'd like, which is why

30:36.520 --> 30:38.840
we had a design sprint a few weeks ago,

30:38.840 --> 30:40.880
and our designers are working with the upstream

30:40.880 --> 30:42.920
GNOME software developers to improve that situation,

30:42.920 --> 30:47.160
so it's all, it's in progress, but it's not,

30:47.160 --> 30:49.520
we just haven't arrived at that final destination,

30:49.520 --> 30:52.360
and I'm not sure we will anytime soon.

30:52.360 --> 30:54.560
It's a rocky road, and we're all on it,

30:54.560 --> 30:55.640
and we're all on it together.

30:55.640 --> 30:56.880
There's no point us fighting.

30:56.880 --> 30:59.760
That's why this flatkill.org, or whatever it was,

30:59.760 --> 31:02.680
was not helpful, because it is in progress,

31:02.680 --> 31:05.560
and it really is, it is sort of a shame,

31:05.560 --> 31:09.680
because the issue, the reason why I'm sensitive to it,

31:09.680 --> 31:10.880
and the reason why I say it's a bit of a shame

31:10.880 --> 31:13.760
is because I've heard a lot over the years

31:13.760 --> 31:15.480
via different methods of feedback

31:15.480 --> 31:18.560
over the different shows that distributing applications

31:18.560 --> 31:21.800
on Linux is a daunting of enough challenge

31:21.800 --> 31:23.880
that a lot of developers look at it and go,

31:23.880 --> 31:25.880
meh, nah, not worth it.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.040
We talk about that all the time.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.240
People driven away are just scared

31:28.240 --> 31:29.880
to even figure out what's happening.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.040
I mean, think about that.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.560
That's where they stop.

31:32.560 --> 31:35.800
I can't even figure out how to properly distribute

31:35.800 --> 31:37.720
downloads from my website in a way

31:37.720 --> 31:40.240
that's guaranteed to work across most of the distributions.

31:40.240 --> 31:42.200
I can give you a use case.

31:42.200 --> 31:46.880
A while ago, we were approached by a software developer,

31:46.880 --> 31:49.840
and they had an application that worked on Windows,

31:49.840 --> 31:52.200
worked on Mac, and they got a prototype working on Linux,

31:52.200 --> 31:53.800
but they didn't know how to distribute it,

31:53.800 --> 31:56.680
and we worked through building a SNAP,

31:56.680 --> 31:59.360
but yeah, they could have chosen any technology.

31:59.360 --> 32:01.360
They just happened to have chosen SNAP,

32:01.360 --> 32:04.080
and we worked with them to get that in the store,

32:04.080 --> 32:07.720
and they had to really sell it to their senior management,

32:07.720 --> 32:09.800
because their senior management was not convinced

32:09.800 --> 32:11.640
that Linux users would pay for software

32:11.640 --> 32:13.800
or would pay for their subscription service,

32:13.800 --> 32:17.080
and they weren't sure that it was worth the time

32:17.080 --> 32:19.240
to invest to port the application.

32:19.240 --> 32:20.560
I mean, it didn't need porting,

32:20.560 --> 32:21.600
because it's all Python and Qt,

32:21.600 --> 32:23.920
and really, it was easy to port.

32:23.920 --> 32:27.320
It was just do we want to support it on Linux,

32:27.320 --> 32:31.040
and it turns out they get better technical reports,

32:31.040 --> 32:33.000
bug reports from Linux users.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.560
They get better feedback from Linux users

32:35.560 --> 32:37.800
and better engagement from Linux users,

32:37.800 --> 32:40.240
and yes, those people do turn into subscribers,

32:40.240 --> 32:43.000
so they are making money out of customers

32:43.000 --> 32:45.500
who are running Linux, so it does work.

32:45.500 --> 32:49.800
It can work, and we can help make it easy

32:49.800 --> 32:52.220
for developers who are building software

32:52.220 --> 32:54.400
to bring their software to Linux users.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.520
It's not perfect, but we're certainly getting there.

32:57.520 --> 33:00.760
I hope so, and it feels like we've made a ton of progress

33:00.760 --> 33:02.740
in that direction, and it's a huge deal

33:02.740 --> 33:06.160
to have Plex server available as a SNAP.

33:06.160 --> 33:09.160
That's one of those things that has, I think,

33:09.160 --> 33:10.600
converted a few folks to Linux,

33:10.600 --> 33:12.880
like, all right, I'll set up a Linux rig in my garage

33:12.880 --> 33:14.480
or in my office, and I'll try to get it.

33:14.480 --> 33:15.880
Yeah, that's one of the first things people want to do,

33:15.880 --> 33:18.560
but it's kind of been a pain to get going before.

33:18.560 --> 33:20.160
Yeah, I mean, if you're not really familiar

33:20.160 --> 33:21.480
with Linux at all, it's sort of daunting.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.200
Now it's a SNAP command.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.360
It's pretty cool.

33:24.360 --> 33:27.520
I was pontificating with Wes earlier today

33:27.520 --> 33:31.240
that I really feel like we're at a point

33:31.240 --> 33:34.440
where for a lot of us that have been using Linux

33:34.440 --> 33:36.840
a long time professionally, there,

33:36.840 --> 33:39.120
and obviously this is broad strokes,

33:39.120 --> 33:41.440
but for me, I've landed on a spot

33:41.440 --> 33:43.080
where I feel like there's two desktops

33:43.080 --> 33:47.520
that are right for a lot of us,

33:47.520 --> 33:49.560
and I know a lot of people are gonna disagree with me

33:49.560 --> 33:50.960
on this, but just go with me.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.640
I think one of our greatest desktops,

33:53.640 --> 33:55.120
surprise, surprise, is Plasma.

33:55.120 --> 34:00.120
If you are willing to invest some time into setting it up,

34:00.280 --> 34:02.500
I think it's a really great utility workstation.

34:02.500 --> 34:03.640
It's a workhorse system.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.480
It's kind of that classic Linux application style

34:06.480 --> 34:08.560
where it has all the right technical fundamentals.

34:08.560 --> 34:10.640
It's a powerhouse, but you gotta get to know it

34:10.640 --> 34:11.480
and you gotta put in the time.

34:11.480 --> 34:13.520
And you still find, you could be using it

34:13.520 --> 34:15.800
a couple of months in and still find new features,

34:15.800 --> 34:17.000
and you're like, oh man, I've been waiting

34:17.000 --> 34:17.860
for computers to do that.

34:17.860 --> 34:19.600
That's great, I didn't even know that was there.

34:19.600 --> 34:21.080
I'm surprised I couldn't find that before.

34:21.080 --> 34:23.240
Like, it's not maybe surfaced super well.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.200
And then, and I'm not just saying that

34:26.200 --> 34:28.240
because they're here, I think on the other end,

34:28.240 --> 34:32.160
you have elementary OS, which is more of a complete,

34:32.160 --> 34:34.960
cohesive package.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.380
Where Plasma is a workstation desktop interface

34:37.380 --> 34:39.780
that you can put on any distribution,

34:39.780 --> 34:42.240
elementary OS is really best as a whole.

34:43.160 --> 34:46.220
And you're really not changing and tweaking your themes.

34:46.220 --> 34:48.880
You could, like, so in code, you could change it

34:48.880 --> 34:50.540
from a light theme to a dark theme.

34:50.540 --> 34:52.800
Like, there's a few areas where you can customize,

34:52.800 --> 34:56.800
but it really is a very well thought out,

34:56.800 --> 34:59.120
refined, out of the box experience

34:59.120 --> 35:01.000
that's not really meant to be heavily modified.

35:01.000 --> 35:01.840
That's what's good about it.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.560
It's meant to just get down to work.

35:03.560 --> 35:05.240
And you have these two really,

35:05.240 --> 35:06.880
these two on the really, I think,

35:06.880 --> 35:08.680
far spectrums of each other.

35:08.680 --> 35:13.040
And in there, ironically, as maybe the most popular

35:13.040 --> 35:16.480
desktop environment, is Gnome Shell.

35:18.440 --> 35:21.920
As time goes on, Gnome Shell has improved,

35:21.920 --> 35:24.080
especially in the last year or so.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.360
It seems like it's gotten a lot better,

35:25.360 --> 35:28.840
but things still need to get fixed up.

35:28.840 --> 35:31.440
And one of the big changes that I think

35:31.440 --> 35:34.120
will be really hard for users to process

35:34.120 --> 35:39.120
is the eventual removal of the GTK theme support.

35:39.120 --> 35:41.640
That seems to be the direction we're going in,

35:41.640 --> 35:44.960
and there's a lot of really good reasons for it.

35:44.960 --> 35:48.320
As a lot of people, like Joey at OMG Ubuntu, are putting it,

35:48.320 --> 35:51.920
GTK 3 themes don't actually exist.

35:53.120 --> 35:55.640
It is an irony, really, because there are so many

35:55.640 --> 35:57.520
beautiful Gnome Shell themes.

35:57.520 --> 35:59.440
The new 18.10 theme is great.

35:59.440 --> 36:02.920
Yaru, and it's really nice.

36:02.920 --> 36:05.480
It almost works, it's so, it's close,

36:05.480 --> 36:08.320
and clever people have managed to hack this together

36:08.320 --> 36:10.440
so that you get something that largely works,

36:10.440 --> 36:12.240
but that doesn't mean it's how it should be.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.640
So this, the way it actually kind of comes down,

36:14.640 --> 36:16.360
and this is from Tobias Bernard,

36:16.360 --> 36:19.600
who's written a well-reasoned article over on his blog,

36:19.600 --> 36:22.360
writes that essentially what it comes down to

36:22.360 --> 36:25.280
is GTK themes are exploiting a flaw rather than standards.

36:25.280 --> 36:26.760
There's no API.

36:26.760 --> 36:27.920
And here's a quote.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.840
There is no clearly defined theming API.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.040
There are CSS style sheets,

36:33.040 --> 36:34.680
but they were only ever meant to be used

36:34.680 --> 36:37.160
by the platform and app developers.

36:37.160 --> 36:40.600
The platform style sheet is called Edwadia,

36:40.600 --> 36:43.920
and that is for a reason, which Yaur is,

36:43.920 --> 36:45.560
or how do you pronounce it, Yaru?

36:45.560 --> 36:48.760
Yaru, whatever the Ubuntu 18.10 theme is,

36:48.760 --> 36:50.200
is based off of Edwadia.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.680
But essentially, themes are a hack.

36:53.680 --> 36:56.160
They're kind of an attempt

36:56.160 --> 36:59.480
to graft on a new look on top of Gnome 3.

36:59.480 --> 37:03.520
And there is inconsistency throughout.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.720
It's sort of like papering over cracks, really.

37:05.720 --> 37:07.680
And then when you launch things like Electron apps

37:07.680 --> 37:09.520
or Firefox, you see little areas

37:09.520 --> 37:11.080
where it's not quite perfect.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.600
There's no really best standards to adhere to.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.520
App developers have no idea

37:15.520 --> 37:17.480
what theme is being smashed onto their app,

37:17.480 --> 37:20.240
so they can't plan for that.

37:20.240 --> 37:22.360
And app developers then have to fix the bugs

37:22.360 --> 37:24.400
that only appear in those custom themes.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.240
So then they get the bug reports.

37:26.240 --> 37:29.040
And then the theme devs have to patch around bugs

37:29.040 --> 37:31.640
and app updates when they find them,

37:31.640 --> 37:34.000
which probably is pretty hit and miss.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.600
It's actually pretty busted right now.

37:36.600 --> 37:39.840
And a lot of, well, I mean, all of the themes really

37:39.840 --> 37:41.880
that you see out there in Gnome 3 land

37:41.880 --> 37:43.200
are all based off of other themes,

37:43.200 --> 37:45.680
because the hard work is actually getting it to work.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.480
You gotta go in and raw dog hack the CSS of the Gnome shell.

37:48.480 --> 37:50.280
Which are used by other things.

37:50.280 --> 37:53.760
That's a huge API, very easy to cause conflicts.

37:53.760 --> 37:58.040
I'm just, I'm really dying to ask Cassidy or Daniel about this,

37:58.040 --> 38:00.200
because to me, this is a problem

38:00.200 --> 38:02.160
that doesn't exist on elementary OS.

38:02.160 --> 38:05.640
And it's a problem that desktops like Plasma plan for,

38:05.640 --> 38:09.320
and they do have a system and support for it baked in.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.520
And then on the other end of the spectrum,

38:10.520 --> 38:12.880
you have elementary OS that just really sort of opted

38:12.880 --> 38:14.920
to just come up with your own look.

38:14.920 --> 38:18.080
And as a result of that, developers know what to expect,

38:18.080 --> 38:20.800
and there is a consistent look.

38:20.800 --> 38:22.440
But it did strike me that, boy, it'd be nice

38:22.440 --> 38:25.840
if I could have a system-wide dark mode on elementary OS.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.040
I had an itch to tweak a few things.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.520
I think because I'm a long-time Linux user,

38:29.520 --> 38:31.520
that just is what I come to expect.

38:31.520 --> 38:33.880
Elementary OS is, in a sense,

38:33.880 --> 38:37.120
making some hard design decisions for the user

38:37.120 --> 38:39.320
that Plasma would let me fiddle with all day.

38:39.320 --> 38:43.280
Yeah, I think I agree completely with Tobias' stance here.

38:43.280 --> 38:49.240
And just the fact that we don't put any style sheet settings

38:49.240 --> 38:52.680
up there, and we make sure that all of our developers

38:52.680 --> 38:54.640
are publishing their screenshots

38:54.640 --> 38:57.000
using the system style sheet and configuration,

38:57.000 --> 38:58.040
does a couple things.

38:58.040 --> 39:01.600
And one, it empowers them to do custom styling

39:01.600 --> 39:04.200
that doesn't look non-native or doesn't break.

39:04.200 --> 39:06.040
Some of the most popular apps in the store

39:06.040 --> 39:09.720
have done really, really interesting things with GTK CSS

39:09.720 --> 39:11.080
that they would never be able to do

39:11.080 --> 39:14.200
if they had to assume that their application

39:14.200 --> 39:15.600
can be styled any which way.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.520
Yeah, the buttons may be somewhere

39:17.520 --> 39:19.480
you completely don't expect or may not light up

39:19.480 --> 39:21.920
the way you expect or have a text color you expect.

39:21.920 --> 39:24.120
Yeah, so they've been able to do a lot of interesting things

39:24.120 --> 39:25.920
with their own visual style and branding,

39:25.920 --> 39:29.400
which makes these apps feel really refined and cool.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.880
But it also helps when you go into App Center

39:31.880 --> 39:34.320
and you're looking at screenshots of all the applications,

39:34.320 --> 39:36.160
what you see is what you get.

39:36.160 --> 39:38.360
It's never going to be some random style sheet

39:38.360 --> 39:40.360
pictured in the screenshots, and then when you download it,

39:40.360 --> 39:42.000
the app doesn't look like that.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.480
You always get what you pay for.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.360
I hadn't even thought about that.

39:45.360 --> 39:48.040
I hadn't even thought about that you could be looking at an app

39:48.040 --> 39:49.560
that has a totally, like in my case,

39:49.560 --> 39:51.120
it would undoubtedly have a light theme,

39:51.120 --> 39:52.560
and then I would install it on my box

39:52.560 --> 39:53.640
and launch it as a dark theme.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.680
It immediately is different than the picture.

39:56.680 --> 39:58.480
That's not something that weirds me out,

39:58.480 --> 40:00.120
but I could see it weirding out some folks

40:00.120 --> 40:02.760
or not meeting expectations.

40:02.760 --> 40:05.360
Well, especially when you've paid money for an application

40:05.360 --> 40:06.800
and then you download it and there's

40:06.800 --> 40:09.200
some great broken visual thing with it,

40:09.200 --> 40:11.520
then you feel like this is supposed

40:11.520 --> 40:14.480
to be a quality product that I paid the developer to get this

40:14.480 --> 40:16.120
and it's broken out of the box.

40:16.120 --> 40:18.760
Wimby, can I ask you about Mate?

40:18.760 --> 40:20.760
Are themes implemented differently

40:20.760 --> 40:23.200
on that era of the Mate desktop?

40:23.200 --> 40:26.200
How does that work over there, or is it an ugly hack, too?

40:26.200 --> 40:28.080
No, it's not an ugly hack.

40:28.080 --> 40:30.800
It's taking advantage of the facilities that

40:30.800 --> 40:36.800
exist in GTK 3 in order to use style classes to style widgets.

40:36.800 --> 40:39.240
Which is how it is done on Qt, too, essentially.

40:39.240 --> 40:44.320
Which is much the same way that the elementary folks

40:44.320 --> 40:50.400
do things, although they prescribe a style sheet that

40:50.400 --> 40:55.280
is part and parcel of the API of designing

40:55.280 --> 40:56.800
your elementary application.

40:56.800 --> 40:59.680
So in elementary, you get this prescribed,

40:59.680 --> 41:01.480
consistent user experience.

41:01.480 --> 41:05.760
And in Mate, because we appeal to an audience that

41:05.760 --> 41:08.920
are used to having multiple themes and the ability

41:08.920 --> 41:11.280
to customize things to their heart's content,

41:11.280 --> 41:14.840
we have multiple themes that implement style classes

41:14.840 --> 41:17.880
in different ways to change the look and feel of the desktop.

41:17.880 --> 41:21.800
So the issue here is specifically what with GNOME?

41:21.800 --> 41:24.640
In the write-up, I noticed particular focus

41:24.640 --> 41:27.440
on client-side decorations, and the header bars

41:27.440 --> 41:30.120
seem to be a major source of issue.

41:30.120 --> 41:33.320
So is it these shell-side things that is really the problem?

41:33.320 --> 41:36.600
It's not the actual GTK 3 applications?

41:36.600 --> 41:38.840
Maybe Dan and Cassidy can answer this better,

41:38.840 --> 41:42.040
but I suspect that GNOME are running

41:42.040 --> 41:46.640
into a position that elementary solved long ago, which

41:46.640 --> 41:52.320
is Adwaita on GNOME is part of the API of the GNOME shell

41:52.320 --> 41:54.560
and the GNOME desktop experience.

41:54.560 --> 41:58.440
But people using GNOME are still in the mindset

41:58.440 --> 42:02.240
that this is a configurable, dynamically themeable thing.

42:02.240 --> 42:04.720
Yeah, I think the hard part, especially for GNOME,

42:04.720 --> 42:07.160
is that there is no GNOME OS.

42:07.160 --> 42:10.560
So the most popular shipped GNOME desktop

42:10.560 --> 42:12.320
is Ubuntu right now, right?

42:12.320 --> 42:16.000
So it's not even shipping their intended visual style.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.280
So when people are writing applications against GNOME,

42:18.280 --> 42:20.400
they're not even really writing against Adwaita.

42:20.400 --> 42:24.940
Yeah, it's interesting that that's the case now,

42:24.940 --> 42:27.840
and now this conversation is relevant.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.320
I think that's interesting.

42:29.320 --> 42:31.320
I wonder if this conversation would be coming up

42:31.320 --> 42:33.560
if it was Fedora that was shipping

42:33.560 --> 42:35.440
as the largest GNOME desktop.

42:35.440 --> 42:41.720
As Dan says, people are targeting effectively Ubuntu.

42:41.720 --> 42:44.960
Predominantly, they're not targeting GTK or Qt at all.

42:44.960 --> 42:47.080
Predominantly, they're using Electron.

42:47.080 --> 42:50.160
The significant number of developers out there

42:50.160 --> 42:54.280
are not writing GTK or Qt applications.

42:54.280 --> 42:57.040
Electron uses a little GTK in there, I think, just a bit.

42:57.040 --> 42:59.160
A tiny, tiny little bit.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.240
No, Electron developer knows that.

43:01.240 --> 43:03.000
No.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.580
That's just an implementation detail.

43:04.580 --> 43:06.320
No reason to concern yourself.

43:06.320 --> 43:09.380
Well, that's fair, but I think we've experienced issues

43:09.380 --> 43:14.120
where Chromium and Chrome, when you maximized it,

43:14.120 --> 43:16.120
didn't have window controls for months.

43:16.120 --> 43:18.240
And they shipped it like that because they only tested

43:18.240 --> 43:19.920
against Ubuntu, and it worked in Ubuntu.

43:19.920 --> 43:22.900
And that was how it worked in Ubuntu, and that was great.

43:22.900 --> 43:25.880
And then on other desktops, it didn't work.

43:25.880 --> 43:29.640
So I think even if they're not writing in GTK,

43:29.640 --> 43:31.680
they're still testing against Ubuntu.

43:31.680 --> 43:35.960
I'm curious to know how the world goes on if we

43:35.960 --> 43:37.960
do go to a one-theme world.

43:37.960 --> 43:40.160
I mean, we essentially are now, but nobody follows it.

43:40.160 --> 43:43.240
So I don't know what they could do to make it a one-theme world.

43:43.240 --> 43:47.080
But that seems to be the direction of the conversation

43:47.080 --> 43:49.640
is make it Adwadia, and then everybody

43:49.640 --> 43:50.760
knows what they're getting.

43:50.760 --> 43:53.920
Is this a one-theme world for all of Linux

43:53.920 --> 43:55.880
or a one-theme world for GNOME?

43:55.880 --> 43:57.560
Yeah, right, exactly, for GNOME.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.560
Well, for Fedora, basically.

43:59.560 --> 44:00.560
Well, that's just it.

44:00.560 --> 44:03.500
It seems to me that Sam Hewitt made a blog post about this

44:03.500 --> 44:05.400
a while ago about how GNOME needs

44:05.400 --> 44:10.960
to make a theming API rather than just screw everybody,

44:10.960 --> 44:12.880
we're doing it this way.

44:12.880 --> 44:16.000
The problem is that we had something like that with GTK2,

44:16.000 --> 44:18.400
and it turned out that it was really restrictive.

44:18.400 --> 44:20.520
And now we have this great API that's

44:20.520 --> 44:22.360
great for application developers,

44:22.360 --> 44:24.520
but it's bad when users touch it.

44:24.520 --> 44:29.360
It empowers developers to have more expressive API available,

44:29.360 --> 44:31.720
but it also makes the applications more fragile

44:31.720 --> 44:33.440
when users try to pull those styles out

44:33.440 --> 44:34.400
from underneath them.

44:34.400 --> 44:36.680
So the reason why this is back up today

44:36.680 --> 44:42.120
is Tobias Bernard, over on one of the blogs at gnome.org,

44:42.120 --> 44:48.280
wrote a really good post on why these themes do not work.

44:48.280 --> 44:50.880
And he showed a lot of examples.

44:50.880 --> 44:53.440
Unfortunately, our friends over at System76

44:53.440 --> 44:55.520
kind of take a beating, because he shows out

44:55.520 --> 44:57.120
a lot of inconsistencies in Pop!

44:57.120 --> 45:00.840
OS's theme, where certain buttons don't light up,

45:00.840 --> 45:03.920
a block is hanging off randomly off the header bar.

45:03.920 --> 45:06.080
And when he zooms in on it, you can really kind of see

45:06.080 --> 45:07.080
the difficulties.

45:07.080 --> 45:10.200
Then he shows some examples of some things coming down

45:10.200 --> 45:12.120
the road in Nautilus that just don't even

45:12.120 --> 45:14.160
render properly at all in the theme,

45:14.160 --> 45:16.400
because the theme is going to have to be tweaked now

45:16.400 --> 45:19.520
to support that new feature in GTK3.

45:19.520 --> 45:24.320
And at the end of it, he basically devastates themes.

45:24.320 --> 45:25.040
He really does.

45:25.040 --> 45:28.520
Like, he's like, it's an ironclad case here.

45:28.520 --> 45:31.000
And it seems to me that, and he even addresses, like,

45:31.000 --> 45:32.160
for the users want themes.

45:32.160 --> 45:33.640
And I admit, I'm one of them.

45:33.640 --> 45:35.440
That's kind of one of the things I like about Plasma,

45:35.440 --> 45:36.600
is I have all those theme options,

45:36.600 --> 45:38.720
and I can just download them right off the thing

45:38.720 --> 45:41.320
and install them and try them.

45:41.320 --> 45:43.560
So the conversation is continuing.

45:43.560 --> 45:47.920
And I have a sense it would be good for GNOME and the, quote,

45:47.920 --> 45:49.760
GNOME platform, end quote.

45:49.760 --> 45:51.240
But I don't understand how it would

45:51.240 --> 45:53.760
be good for downstream distributions that

45:53.760 --> 45:56.200
want to have a different look and feel,

45:56.200 --> 45:59.400
so that way it looks and feels like Antegros,

45:59.400 --> 46:00.920
or it looks and feels like Ubuntu.

46:00.920 --> 46:03.360
Like, you've got to tweak it a little bit.

46:03.360 --> 46:07.720
I think, I mean, that's always been the case.

46:07.720 --> 46:10.280
Maybe everybody could ship the same exact looking GNOME shell,

46:10.280 --> 46:11.320
but I just don't see it.

46:11.320 --> 46:14.240
And there's no formal facility, there's no formal API

46:14.240 --> 46:15.840
that they could be shutting down here,

46:15.840 --> 46:17.240
because they never created one.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.840
So people can just make the same hacks

46:18.840 --> 46:19.600
they've always been making.

46:19.600 --> 46:21.200
So I don't really quite understand

46:21.200 --> 46:22.960
how they would even enforce it.

46:22.960 --> 46:24.440
But the conversation's getting louder,

46:24.440 --> 46:25.880
and I find it to be fascinating.

46:25.880 --> 46:27.480
And I say, if you're going to make Adwadi the default,

46:27.480 --> 46:28.720
you better keep investing in it.

46:28.720 --> 46:30.840
Keep making it look great.

46:30.840 --> 46:33.160
But it's a great post, and we'll have a link to it

46:33.160 --> 46:34.000
in the show notes.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.560
If you want to look at the examples,

46:35.560 --> 46:38.880
and if you are concerned about this at all,

46:38.880 --> 46:40.640
I really encourage you to read the post.

46:40.640 --> 46:42.920
We'll have OMG Abuntu's summary of it,

46:42.920 --> 46:45.040
and then we'll have a direct link to the blog post too.

46:45.040 --> 46:46.800
In the show notes, linuxunplugged.com

46:46.800 --> 46:48.240
slash 271.

46:48.240 --> 46:48.840
Let's keep moving, though.

46:48.840 --> 46:50.320
We've got a lot more to get into.

46:50.320 --> 46:51.440
We've got much more.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.840
A new version of DXVK is out this week.

46:53.840 --> 46:56.720
It features some great improvements and support

46:56.720 --> 46:59.360
for great new games that were either supported before

46:59.360 --> 47:04.240
and broke or needed fixes, like Assassin's Creed and BioShock

47:04.240 --> 47:05.800
and Dark Souls 3.

47:05.800 --> 47:07.200
Some really good stuff in here.

47:07.200 --> 47:11.760
And also today, the folks over at Crossover Office

47:11.760 --> 47:17.760
released Crossover 18, which includes their DXVK support,

47:17.760 --> 47:20.960
which is support for Vulkan.

47:20.960 --> 47:23.960
What is it, takes DirectX calls and translates them to Vulkan?

47:23.960 --> 47:25.880
Direct3D 10 and 11.

47:25.880 --> 47:27.280
Thank you, thank you.

47:27.280 --> 47:28.480
So that's in Crossover now too.

47:28.480 --> 47:30.040
So they had another release this week,

47:30.040 --> 47:31.600
so that's congratulations to them.

47:31.600 --> 47:32.680
Oh, hot new tech.

47:32.680 --> 47:34.880
Linux Academy is trying something kind of adorable,

47:34.880 --> 47:36.160
and I thought I'd give a shout out to that.

47:36.160 --> 47:40.160
If you are carving pumpkins with the kids, which we do it now,

47:40.160 --> 47:42.040
two rounds of pumpkin carvings.

47:42.040 --> 47:44.120
That's because we've got a practiced hand.

47:44.120 --> 47:44.720
Oh, yeah.

47:44.720 --> 47:47.760
Oh, I am the best gut scooper.

47:47.760 --> 47:49.000
Are you putting tux on there?

47:49.000 --> 47:49.840
You got a tux pumpkin?

47:49.840 --> 47:50.640
Yeah, what's happening?

47:50.640 --> 47:52.200
That is such a good idea, I can't believe in it.

47:52.200 --> 47:53.760
No, I did an owl pumpkin last week.

47:53.760 --> 47:54.240
Oh.

47:54.240 --> 47:56.000
Yeah, for the little one.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.440
And I didn't even think of this, but Linux Academy

47:58.440 --> 48:00.600
is doing a pumpkin carving contest

48:00.600 --> 48:04.000
if you want to win some gems, which you can cash in for swag.

48:04.000 --> 48:06.520
I think you just hit them up at hashtag jackonlinux.

48:06.520 --> 48:07.640
And oh, that's funny, because we're

48:07.640 --> 48:09.320
going to be doing some jackonlinux stuff.

48:09.320 --> 48:11.240
Jack-o-linux, jack-o-linux.

48:11.240 --> 48:12.600
I'll put a link in the show notes.

48:12.600 --> 48:16.280
If you're carving pumpkins and want to win some swag, why not?

48:16.280 --> 48:17.080
I should have thought of that.

48:17.080 --> 48:17.680
You know what I did?

48:17.680 --> 48:19.320
And you guys can rip this off, and maybe you'll

48:19.320 --> 48:22.600
see some swag, is my middle child wanted

48:22.600 --> 48:24.400
to do a Pinocchio pumpkin.

48:24.400 --> 48:27.160
So we looked up the picture on the phone

48:27.160 --> 48:28.960
and kept it there while we were carving it.

48:28.960 --> 48:33.040
But then the stroke of genius was busted off the stem

48:33.040 --> 48:35.640
off the top of the pumpkin and rammed it in the nose hole,

48:35.640 --> 48:37.960
so it's got a Pinocchio nose from the stem.

48:37.960 --> 48:40.160
It was a pro move.

48:40.160 --> 48:42.360
Also, just one more quick one this week, Chrome OS

48:42.360 --> 48:46.080
in the stable channel is now getting Linux app support.

48:46.080 --> 48:47.240
It seems like a huge deal.

48:47.240 --> 48:49.080
And the folks over at linuxjournal.com

48:49.080 --> 48:50.720
decided, well, let's install Gnome software

48:50.720 --> 48:52.280
and then play around with that.

48:52.280 --> 48:53.920
And they ended up getting that installed.

48:53.920 --> 48:55.840
And so they could just browse Gnome software.

48:55.840 --> 48:57.800
They got GIMP installed.

48:57.800 --> 49:00.000
It is a Chromebook world out there, Wes.

49:00.000 --> 49:00.720
You should get one.

49:00.720 --> 49:02.360
You'd be hip down in Seattle with a Chromebook.

49:02.360 --> 49:03.240
Oh, yes, I would.

49:03.240 --> 49:05.120
Do you actually see many Chromebooks in Seattle?

49:05.120 --> 49:05.640
Not really.

49:05.640 --> 49:07.720
No, I haven't actually ever seen one.

49:07.720 --> 49:10.400
Now that I think about it, I've never seen one.

49:10.400 --> 49:11.720
But you should still get one.

49:11.720 --> 49:14.000
It's weird to see it when you look at them installing it

49:14.000 --> 49:16.480
and it just says, installing Linux.

49:16.480 --> 49:17.320
Yeah.

49:17.320 --> 49:19.040
Like, what a weird message.

49:19.040 --> 49:21.080
But hey, I mean, stable, it's a big deal.

49:21.080 --> 49:22.760
It actually means people might use it now.

49:22.760 --> 49:24.520
Well, speaking of Microsoft, oh, wait.

49:24.520 --> 49:26.960
No, that's just what Google is turning into.

49:26.960 --> 49:29.560
Well, speaking of actual Microsoft,

49:29.560 --> 49:32.600
huge news that everybody's been talking about

49:32.600 --> 49:36.520
is that they contributed 60,000 patents

49:36.520 --> 49:38.840
to the Open Innovation Network.

49:38.840 --> 49:43.000
And I got to say that, as always, the response

49:43.000 --> 49:44.520
has been wide ranging.

49:44.520 --> 49:48.120
But the overall, I think, response has been tremendously

49:48.120 --> 49:49.200
positive.

49:49.200 --> 49:52.480
I have seen, I still am seeing tweets and people

49:52.480 --> 49:54.480
in the chat room and people in the Telegram group

49:54.480 --> 49:56.480
going, wow, they really have changed.

49:56.480 --> 49:57.480
They really have changed.

49:57.480 --> 49:59.320
Wow, this is it right here.

49:59.320 --> 50:01.040
This is the big change.

50:01.040 --> 50:02.080
It is pretty massive.

50:02.080 --> 50:03.320
Have I talked to you all about this?

50:03.320 --> 50:04.920
What are your thoughts on Microsoft contributing

50:04.920 --> 50:07.360
60,000 patents to the Open Innovation Network?

50:07.360 --> 50:09.600
Do you think it changes anything practically?

50:09.600 --> 50:11.360
I mean, I think it had been hanging out there.

50:11.360 --> 50:12.480
It had been a little bit awkward, right?

50:12.480 --> 50:14.760
Because we've seen the Microsoft Loves Linux

50:14.760 --> 50:16.200
campaign for a couple of years now.

50:16.200 --> 50:18.640
We've seen their big open source pushes.

50:18.640 --> 50:21.040
This sort of felt like a little bit of that old management

50:21.040 --> 50:24.920
still there, or the mean corporate Microsoft.

50:24.920 --> 50:27.000
And it's, well, we still got our patent war

50:27.000 --> 50:28.880
and that whole Android situation.

50:28.880 --> 50:31.960
So it kind of just feels like an act of good faith,

50:31.960 --> 50:34.840
as sort of like, we don't need to play on this level anymore.

50:34.840 --> 50:36.960
And let's just compete on software.

50:36.960 --> 50:40.120
Yeah, but Wimpy, isn't this just a long play

50:40.120 --> 50:42.760
to do the embrace part before you extinguish?

50:42.760 --> 50:43.600
No.

50:43.600 --> 50:47.320
All right, very good.

50:47.320 --> 50:49.160
Here we have it.

50:49.160 --> 50:50.680
OK, well, that's settled.

50:50.680 --> 50:53.720
I'm not going to indulge any negativity around this subject.

50:53.720 --> 50:56.600
I think this is remarkable that Microsoft

50:56.600 --> 51:00.640
have contributed so many patents to the OIN

51:00.640 --> 51:04.840
and is the most significant evidence

51:04.840 --> 51:07.560
that we can point to that there is definitely

51:07.560 --> 51:09.720
a cultural change.

51:09.720 --> 51:13.320
Not just happening, but that has happened within Microsoft.

51:13.320 --> 51:13.880
I agree.

51:13.880 --> 51:16.400
These kinds of things inside companies this size

51:16.400 --> 51:19.200
take a lot of people internally to make it happen.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.080
Yeah, exactly.

51:20.080 --> 51:21.360
There were a lot of cogs involved.

51:21.360 --> 51:23.080
I'd be fascinated to know how this started.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.960
Where's the advocacy coming from?

51:24.960 --> 51:26.080
So we were going to ask that.

51:26.080 --> 51:28.760
I did invite a couple of folks on the show.

51:28.760 --> 51:31.600
They both attempted to make it work, but were traveling

51:31.600 --> 51:33.440
and couldn't come on the show today.

51:33.440 --> 51:34.160
I was going to ask them that.

51:34.160 --> 51:35.680
So if I get the opportunity in the future, though,

51:35.680 --> 51:36.880
I think the story is big enough, I

51:36.880 --> 51:39.080
may still try to take them up on that when they're done.

51:39.080 --> 51:41.040
Although, then we're running into holidays.

51:41.040 --> 51:46.480
But it is a hell of a move by a company that was once

51:46.480 --> 51:48.600
considered at war with Linux.

51:48.600 --> 51:51.140
And it is true that it really only protects people

51:51.140 --> 51:52.920
in the open innovation network.

51:52.920 --> 51:55.560
That innovation network is free to join.

51:55.560 --> 51:58.060
And it's a massive statement.

51:58.060 --> 52:00.680
It's really also a messaging to developers

52:00.680 --> 52:03.120
that you can use these core technologies, the core

52:03.120 --> 52:04.960
technologies that, by the way, power Azure,

52:04.960 --> 52:07.160
you can use those to build your devices.

52:07.160 --> 52:09.200
And you can hook them all the way up to the Microsoft tools

52:09.200 --> 52:11.240
chain, and we're not going to come after you.

52:11.240 --> 52:12.760
That's really what the message is here.

52:12.760 --> 52:14.080
And this is how they're signaling it.

52:14.080 --> 52:15.100
That's really what this is about.

52:15.100 --> 52:15.960
It's about signaling.

52:15.960 --> 52:16.880
It's about positioning.

52:16.880 --> 52:18.640
And I welcome it.

52:18.640 --> 52:19.600
I say congratulations.

52:19.600 --> 52:21.480
Huge story to them.

52:21.480 --> 52:25.520
And will they stop going after Android ex-fat use?

52:25.520 --> 52:26.760
Who knows?

52:26.760 --> 52:27.920
Who knows?

52:27.920 --> 52:29.160
But it doesn't really matter.

52:29.160 --> 52:30.120
I think this is a good.

52:30.120 --> 52:32.600
That separate would be great to see them stop doing that.

52:32.600 --> 52:34.760
But separate of that, this is still a great move.

52:34.760 --> 52:36.880
I remember the days when I would talk with Jeremy

52:36.880 --> 52:38.400
from the Samba project.

52:38.400 --> 52:40.120
And he would tell me how paranoid

52:40.120 --> 52:42.400
they were constantly of Microsoft coming after them.

52:42.400 --> 52:43.560
I can only imagine.

52:43.560 --> 52:46.840
And then the monomemory around Mono, the paranoia around Mono.

52:46.840 --> 52:48.800
I had to lose my tomboy over all that.

52:48.800 --> 52:52.120
Tomboy was one of the best note-taking applications

52:52.120 --> 52:54.320
for desktop Linux back in the day.

52:54.320 --> 52:57.640
But it had the one sin of being a Mono-based application.

52:57.640 --> 53:00.120
And then there was that, I don't know,

53:00.120 --> 53:01.360
what would you call it, Popey?

53:01.360 --> 53:06.040
There was like a mandate to rid Mono across Linux, right?

53:06.040 --> 53:07.080
Yep, there was.

53:07.080 --> 53:09.960
And sadly, some of those people worked at Canonical

53:09.960 --> 53:13.240
and celebrated when Mono was removed from the ISO.

53:13.240 --> 53:15.480
That may be very, very sad indeed.

53:15.480 --> 53:19.800
And it was all out of fear of Microsoft's patent aggression.

53:19.800 --> 53:21.200
That's what it was all based out of.

53:21.200 --> 53:23.880
Completely mental.

53:23.880 --> 53:24.880
Yeah, now here we are.

53:24.880 --> 53:26.360
And it never materialized.

53:26.360 --> 53:28.160
And they've contributed 60,000 patents

53:28.160 --> 53:31.240
to a patent consortium that protects people

53:31.240 --> 53:33.040
that use Linux technologies.

53:33.040 --> 53:33.920
Just weird.

53:33.920 --> 53:34.880
It's great, though.

53:34.880 --> 53:35.640
It's great.

53:35.640 --> 53:39.040
What's also great is this week, in just a few hours

53:39.040 --> 53:41.280
from this recording, especially from the release

53:41.280 --> 53:44.640
of this recording, Ubuntu 18.10 will be out.

53:44.640 --> 53:46.400
It's a Cosmic Cuttlefish.

53:46.400 --> 53:47.760
And it's got that brand new theme

53:47.760 --> 53:51.520
we were just talking about and the latest performance

53:51.520 --> 53:54.440
improvements to GNOME and GNOME 3.30.

53:54.440 --> 53:58.000
And I kind of feel like, in a big way,

53:58.000 --> 54:02.080
it's the best-looking, best-performing Ubuntu

54:02.080 --> 54:04.200
I have ever used.

54:04.200 --> 54:06.880
Couldn't believe it when I loaded it up.

54:06.880 --> 54:09.480
And it had been a while since I was using GNOME, too.

54:09.480 --> 54:11.680
So it was also my first back into GNOME.

54:11.680 --> 54:13.160
And oh, man.

54:13.160 --> 54:15.920
Oh, man, if it didn't make me kind of go, this is nice.

54:15.920 --> 54:17.080
You had that same experience.

54:17.080 --> 54:17.480
Oh, yeah.

54:17.480 --> 54:19.320
I mean, it kind of feels like really hitting

54:19.320 --> 54:20.880
the stride after 1804.

54:20.880 --> 54:23.440
And then now things are just getting more polished.

54:23.440 --> 54:24.840
And they fit together better.

54:24.840 --> 54:25.800
And it's faster.

54:25.800 --> 54:29.520
And finally, we're at home in GNOME as much as we can be.

54:29.520 --> 54:30.600
It's really nice.

54:30.600 --> 54:33.680
Super, super smooth, really good-looking.

54:33.680 --> 54:37.520
And there's still a few areas that, long-term, I'd

54:37.520 --> 54:38.380
love to see changed.

54:38.380 --> 54:42.320
But I think it's one of the best implementations.

54:42.320 --> 54:43.600
What are they?

54:43.600 --> 54:46.240
Well, honestly, I'd love to see the installer redone.

54:46.240 --> 54:47.160
I don't know.

54:47.160 --> 54:49.320
I feel like it just feels a little.

54:49.320 --> 54:50.960
It does fine.

54:50.960 --> 54:54.200
But the last part where it's installing packages

54:54.200 --> 54:57.160
and all of that, like the whole terminal box

54:57.160 --> 54:58.720
is cramped and tiny.

54:58.720 --> 55:01.720
The status information is not very useful.

55:01.720 --> 55:04.200
It just feels like it could use a retouch a little bit.

55:04.200 --> 55:05.400
And I don't know.

55:05.400 --> 55:06.360
It's not horrible.

55:06.360 --> 55:08.240
But it feels a little out of date these days,

55:08.240 --> 55:10.680
compared to what some other distro installers look like.

55:10.680 --> 55:13.560
Now, there's a lot of installers that are a lot worse.

55:13.560 --> 55:16.480
So it's not a huge complaint.

55:16.480 --> 55:19.520
Because it's, on the average, pretty good.

55:19.520 --> 55:21.600
I think Ubiquity has stood the test of time.

55:21.600 --> 55:23.720
And everything else is just catching up a bit now.

55:23.720 --> 55:24.080
Yeah.

55:24.080 --> 55:25.200
I think it just needs a little catch-up.

55:25.200 --> 55:26.680
Yeah, exactly.

55:26.680 --> 55:29.840
Also, I think it would be super cool to see a little nod

55:29.840 --> 55:31.840
towards some kind of smartphone integration.

55:31.840 --> 55:34.920
I just think that's a good end user feature, like GS Connect

55:34.920 --> 55:36.800
or something like that in there out of the box

55:36.800 --> 55:38.680
would be pretty, pretty sweet.

55:38.680 --> 55:40.600
Some other features around that, too, I think

55:40.600 --> 55:41.720
would be kind of nice, like integrating

55:41.720 --> 55:43.240
with people's workflows and stuff.

55:43.240 --> 55:45.280
I think Canonical, too, could be in a good position

55:45.280 --> 55:47.400
to work with upstream cloud providers

55:47.400 --> 55:49.360
to have more account integration.

55:49.360 --> 55:51.640
I feel like that's something that would be really nice if I

55:51.640 --> 55:54.640
could easily log in and get my calendar and my contacts

55:54.640 --> 55:55.840
and all of that synced down.

55:55.840 --> 55:57.160
I know it's been a long-term hope thing.

55:57.160 --> 55:59.280
But it'd be really nice to see that.

55:59.280 --> 56:01.160
Because that's something you do get on Chrome OS

56:01.160 --> 56:03.880
or you will get on the Chrome OS tablet and stuff like that.

56:03.880 --> 56:05.360
And you get it with Outlook and whatnot.

56:05.360 --> 56:06.720
More people expect the cloud to be

56:06.720 --> 56:09.040
sort of first class in their operating system.

56:09.040 --> 56:13.520
But out of the box, beautiful, fast.

56:13.520 --> 56:15.560
I didn't really have much more takeaway than that

56:15.560 --> 56:17.160
because not only is it not out yet,

56:17.160 --> 56:18.280
so I don't want to give it the full review,

56:18.280 --> 56:20.320
but I've only had a few days with it.

56:20.320 --> 56:22.080
But damn, really well done.

56:22.080 --> 56:23.320
Wimpy or Popey, is there anything

56:23.320 --> 56:24.800
in particular with the 1810 cycle

56:24.800 --> 56:26.480
that you want to call out?

56:26.480 --> 56:28.560
I'm thinking.

56:28.560 --> 56:31.240
Anything, or anything with Mate too, Ubuntu Mate.

56:31.240 --> 56:34.200
Well, Popey, do you want to answer for Ubuntu?

56:34.200 --> 56:37.760
So from Ubuntu, I'm one of those people

56:37.760 --> 56:40.800
who always try and stick to the LTS.

56:40.800 --> 56:45.480
And then something comes along in the release after the LTS,

56:45.480 --> 56:47.080
and it really makes me want to upgrade.

56:47.080 --> 56:48.040
Yes, yes.

56:48.040 --> 56:50.600
But, and I'm sorry to do this, the fact

56:50.600 --> 56:53.240
that we now have snaps, I generally

56:53.240 --> 56:55.720
don't need to do that because I don't need to upgrade.

56:55.720 --> 56:59.080
I can stay on the LTS, and I can get all the new applications.

56:59.080 --> 57:02.880
So I'm actually definitely staying on the LTS.

57:02.880 --> 57:05.320
I love the work the desktop team are doing,

57:05.320 --> 57:07.520
but I'm sticking with 1804.

57:07.520 --> 57:08.200
Fair enough.

57:08.200 --> 57:11.480
I actually think you could be on 1604 for the most part

57:11.480 --> 57:13.120
and not really feel it these days.

57:13.120 --> 57:14.040
It's kind of funny.

57:14.040 --> 57:14.880
It's totally changed.

57:14.880 --> 57:16.720
It's a different world from two years ago.

57:16.720 --> 57:19.720
This is the lunch conversation that Wes and I had.

57:19.720 --> 57:20.280
Exactly.

57:20.280 --> 57:21.320
Wes was like, yeah, I just don't know

57:21.320 --> 57:22.920
if I want to stick with an LTS because it usually

57:22.920 --> 57:23.720
starts to feel stale.

57:23.720 --> 57:25.360
I'm like, yeah, back in the day, I'd

57:25.360 --> 57:27.200
feel like a distribution was stale three months

57:27.200 --> 57:28.360
after release.

57:28.360 --> 57:30.840
But today, I could be on 1604, and I wouldn't even feel it.

57:30.840 --> 57:32.720
It really is true.

57:32.720 --> 57:34.480
Well, what about that Ubuntu mate there?

57:34.480 --> 57:36.880
Wimp, anything you want to call out for the 18.10 release?

57:36.880 --> 57:40.000
So the 18.10 release, curiously, has really

57:40.000 --> 57:44.540
got an eye on what will become Ubuntu 1804.2.

57:44.540 --> 57:49.240
So one of the things that I've been making representation

57:49.240 --> 57:52.360
for within the Ubuntu project, with the help

57:52.360 --> 57:57.840
of the likes of Will Cook, is to land the necessary drivers

57:57.840 --> 58:05.160
to have a really good AMD GPU experience in 18.10.

58:05.160 --> 58:09.600
Because the hardware stack that exists in 18.10

58:09.600 --> 58:15.040
is what will become the hardware enablement stack in 1804.2.

58:15.040 --> 58:18.360
So we've lined everything up so that that stack

58:18.360 --> 58:19.600
is in a good place.

58:19.600 --> 58:23.920
And therefore, that's what's coming to 1804.2.

58:23.920 --> 58:27.360
And from the mate point of view, all of the work

58:27.360 --> 58:34.080
has been in upstream mate to fix lots of bugs in mate itself,

58:34.080 --> 58:39.120
which all now exist in Ubuntu mate 18.10.

58:39.120 --> 58:43.320
And that's a prerequisite having all of those fixes in 18.10.

58:43.320 --> 58:46.840
You have to have all of your fixes in the current release

58:46.840 --> 58:49.320
in order for them to be candidates for what's

58:49.320 --> 58:52.480
called SRUed back to 1804.

58:52.480 --> 58:56.120
So all of the setup for 18.10 is work

58:56.120 --> 59:00.800
to make an 1804.2 that has got lots of fixes and better

59:00.800 --> 59:02.040
hardware support in it.

59:02.040 --> 59:03.160
Hold on a second here.

59:03.160 --> 59:04.160
Hold on a second here.

59:04.160 --> 59:06.200
So in a way, what you're saying is

59:06.200 --> 59:09.520
you could view the dot, like the intermediary release

59:09.520 --> 59:13.840
between an LTS, like the 18.10 release in this case,

59:13.840 --> 59:19.240
as a cycle to build proper back ports to 1804?

59:19.240 --> 59:19.760
Yes.

59:19.760 --> 59:28.200
And certainly, so 16.04 was my first LTS with Ubuntu mate.

59:28.200 --> 59:34.320
And we didn't do a great job of actually delivering fixes back

59:34.320 --> 59:36.320
to 16.04.

59:36.320 --> 59:37.760
And I've learned from that.

59:37.760 --> 59:42.720
So I've used this 18.10 cycle as a means

59:42.720 --> 59:47.080
to collect up those fixes to then start delivering them back.

59:47.080 --> 59:51.000
Now, I'm not saying you have to wait all the time until 1804.2.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.920
They'll start drip feeding out now.

59:52.920 --> 59:57.680
But by the time 1804.2 comes out in February, all of that stuff

59:57.680 --> 01:00:01.280
should have been back ported and available.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:02.320
That's cool.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.160
I love hearing that.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:04.180
Because that means that if I just

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.520
want to stay on the previous install that I'm happy with,

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:09.160
I still get all the goodies that I really care about.

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:14.640
And then for fun, I've, so this is a little look

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.320
at how the sausage is made.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:20.680
I've decided to do a little side project for Ubuntu mate for 18.10.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:26.320
So as we record this in two days from now, 18.10 is released.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.440
And I will be releasing bespoke images for the GPD Pocket

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:36.280
and the GPD Pocket 2 alongside the official releases.

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:40.400
So you got your hands on the new GPD Pocket.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.400
How does it run on there?

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.480
How does everything run?

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:48.160
The GPD Pocket 2 is a huge improvement over the GPD Pocket in every respect.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.480
So in terms of what it has inside it, it's

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:58.400
equivalent to a Mac Air Book in terms of CPU and all the rest of it.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.720
Yeah.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.240
Boy.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.160
Yeah, it's the same.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:03.720
It's the same CPU package and everything.

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:04.760
Wow.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.160
And the thing that's peculiar about those, if you're not familiar,

01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:14.040
these are milled aluminum netbook style devices.

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.600
So they're seven inch screens, although ridiculously,

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:22.600
they're 1920 by 1200 displays, seven inch displays.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:26.160
So effectively, they're high DPI because of the size

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:29.400
of the screen and the pixel density.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:32.840
So I've prepackaged these with the necessary,

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.320
and also the screens are rotated.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:38.440
So if you don't make any accommodation for the hardware,

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:42.360
you get the screen displayed in the wrong perspective.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:46.680
So these images have got the necessary rotations for the screen

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:51.040
and also the necessary rotations for the touch display.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.720
Otherwise, where you touch doesn't level up

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:55.960
with the actual display itself.

01:01:55.960 --> 01:02:00.240
And things like changing the font size of the console font.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.760
So if you do switch to a TTY, you can actually read it.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:09.240
And rotating the frame buffer so that when

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.160
you're looking at grub, for example,

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.400
that sort of stuff is correct.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.880
And I've landed a curious little tweak

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:17.400
in the Ubuntu Marte image, which is

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:24.480
to use some funky features of the X server to do some scaling.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:29.360
So obviously, 1920 by 1200 on a seven inch display

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.760
is teeny tiny.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.640
But if you enable high DPI, it's too big

01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:40.080
because you effectively get a 960 by 600 display

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.000
effective resolution, which is too small.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.840
So I've used a quirk of the X server to scale that.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.520
So you get something that's representative,

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:54.000
like 1280 by 800 effective resolution.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.120
So it's still big enough to be useful,

01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:00.080
but also large enough that you can actually see and use.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.080
And that's hidden just behind the tick box.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.160
So if you don't like that, you can just turn it off

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.160
and get the full native resolution.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.760
Oh, that sounds like a really nice setup.

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.960
That sounds like it's going to be the best out-of-the-box

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.120
experience on this hardware.

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.400
Yeah, I like the original one.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:17.120
But the community around the original GPD Pocket

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.960
has sort of fallen by the wayside now.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.000
So that's one of the reasons why I've done this,

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.840
is to sort of reinvigorate that to give those people that have

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.640
got these devices somewhere to go.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:29.680
But the GPD Pocket 2 is sort of brand new.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:32.720
Their backers are just receiving those units now.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.520
And you can buy them on Amazon and all the rest of it.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.600
So I think it's a good time to provide

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:41.440
a good image for that device.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.680
Rough estimation of the battery?

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.360
About 12 hours.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.840
No.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:47.520
No.

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.240
Wow.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:48.760
Yeah.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.360
They must cram a decent battery inside that little thing.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:54.880
Yeah, it's a good battery, and it sips power.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.800
So it's about 10 hours for the original model

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.400
and about 12 for the new one.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.960
I've had both of them on a desk today.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:04.440
Neither of them have seen a charger all day.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.400
And they've got about 60% battery life left.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:10.000
Yeah, that CPU is supposed to be pretty low power.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.840
And I guess the keyboard, is it actually usable?

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.200
I mean, you can't fit two hands on it.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:20.600
So in the GPD Pocket, in the original,

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:23.800
the key cap arrangement was just mental.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:26.720
And the key caps themselves were wobbly,

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.080
and they weren't accurate.

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:31.000
And you could strike a key, and it wouldn't register.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.720
And that whole experience was hideous.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.680
Fortunately, although the keyboard arrangement

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:41.040
on the GPD Pocket 2 is still, let's say, quirky,

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:44.280
the keys themselves actually work well.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:48.400
So it's just a case of learning the peculiar keyboard

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.040
arrangement.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.040
But when you strike a key, it does actually

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.600
do what you expect it to do.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:56.360
And having the two side by side, the GPD Pocket 2,

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:59.520
as somebody who does an awful lot on the command line

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.120
and with a keyboard, is leaps and bounds more usable

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.680
than its predecessor.

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:07.440
Well, I enjoyed your full review on the Ubuntu podcast.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.880
So people should check that out, ubuntupodcast.org.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:13.360
Rumor has it there will be a full review there very soon.

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:14.440
Check it out there.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.920
In fact, I think it's already out.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.680
So you might just go over there.

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.080
And if it's not, just download all of them

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.040
until you find it.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:20.160
Just download all of them.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:20.840
Keep going.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:23.600
It was out on Friday last week, so you'd go and listen

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:24.640
to that right now.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:25.480
Nice.

01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.000
Well, that is really making me want one.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.760
Well, especially if you're like an on-call engineer or something,

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:32.880
that would just be the perfect guy

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.880
to drag around with you, a terminal, wherever you are.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:35.880
No kidding.

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:36.480
No kidding.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.600
You know we could put Jack Audio on that thing

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.800
and make it a podcast, Rick.

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.320
You know we could do that.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.200
I wonder how it would hold up.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.320
It has a fan, right, Wimpy?

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.360
It has a little fan in there.

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.000
So Joe would still yell at me for it.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Yeah, so the original one is a software-controlled fan.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.640
And interestingly, the second-gen one actually

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.240
has a hardware fan button.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:59.320
So you can turn it on and off at will.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.320
It's a bit sort of manual.

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:05.520
But it doesn't need the fan unless you're doing something

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:08.760
really intensive with it.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.040
So you can turn it on and off.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.120
And obviously, you can control the battery endurance

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:12.960
with that as well.

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.520
The perfect broadcast, Rick.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:15.800
You can just flip off the fan.

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.720
I think that's perfect.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.800
So there's another set of devices

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.280
that are getting an Ubuntu update of a different nature

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.360
this week.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:25.880
The Ubiports project is getting down

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.240
a pretty good cadence of releases.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:32.040
And they have OTA 5, which has finished up

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.960
some of the 16.04 LTS support.

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:38.800
You'll remember that phone versions of Ubuntu

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.880
are one LTS behind.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:41.560
That's current for them.

01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.280
And there's some nice improvements

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:44.680
in this new release.

01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:48.600
And so we wanted to chat with Dalton from Ubiports.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.080
Dalton is there.

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.400
I asked him what his title was.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.920
And he told me that it was development manager.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:55.800
So he is their development manager.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.240
And we asked Dalton to tell us about the new release.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.800
Dalton, welcome to the show.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.200
Hey, thanks for having me.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.480
So Dalton, it looks like the big news this week

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:06.240
is Ubuntu Touch OTA 5 is out.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.560
What are the touchstone features in OTA 5?

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.960
Yeah, OTA 5 has made a bit of noise.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.720
The big feature we've got out this time

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:16.000
is the new browser, that is the Morph browser.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.200
This brings the Qt Web Engine, replacing the old Oxide Engine.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.360
Both of them are based on Chromium.

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:25.200
But Qt Web Engine is a lot newer.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:26.200
Oh, yeah.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:29.880
And it also looks like it's got sort of a more responsive

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.680
design to it.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:34.120
So it scales across different devices and screen sizes

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:34.880
as well, true?

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:37.720
Yep, we've always had the device scaling features

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.040
coming in with convergence.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.920
But this just adds a little bit of extra sauce to it.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:45.440
Yeah, I suppose that probably is true.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.680
Is that particularly tricky with Ubuntu Touch?

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:52.120
Everything you put in has to be scalable to different device

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:52.920
sizes.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:56.800
One of the tricks of the iOS platform is it's all fixed.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:58.680
They keep adding to it, and changing it,

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:00.200
and adding notches and whatnot.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:01.440
But it's essentially all fixed.

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:03.800
You can do dynamic layout, but you almost always

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.000
know what you're going to get.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.800
But with Ubuntu Touch, there's really no way for you

01:08:07.800 --> 01:08:10.400
as the development team to know, or the key developers,

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.160
has that been a challenge?

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:15.160
Or is technology to the point where that's totally doable?

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.640
So a lot of developers are getting experience

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:21.440
with this type of design with websites and mobile first.

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:25.080
But it is always kind of a weird paradigm

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.960
to get your head around where my app could

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.440
be used on any of these all the time, and it could change.

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.960
So some of the pinnacles of that design

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:36.040
include Deco2, the browser itself,

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:38.440
and a lot of other apps that we've got in our store.

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:39.360
That makes a lot of sense.

01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:40.920
Yeah, right, these sorts of apps are more popular.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.920
We're thinking about this already as people

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.480
making apps for end users.

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:46.760
I'm pretty curious.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.840
It looks like from the end user perspective,

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.400
getting OTA 5 is pretty easy.

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.840
I can just hit Upgrade, get the latest OTA,

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.880
reboot, and be in the new environment.

01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:57.520
How do you get to that level of QA?

01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.360
How do you test this stuff so you know you're not

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:02.320
going to break people's phones, especially as a smaller team?

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.960
We had a lot of people doing a lot of testing.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:08.080
I know for my part, I've got several devices here,

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:10.800
including the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 tablet.

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:14.680
Those were going from 1504 to 1604 daily.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:15.680
Wow.

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:18.040
It's just a lot of keeping that all straight

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:20.720
and making sure that it's all working.

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.200
And we have a great community and an excellent QA team

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.760
who is helping us out with that throughout the entire process.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:26.960
That's great.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.800
We also have the new Setup Wizard,

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:32.040
which helps you once you get onto 1604,

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:36.240
since apps aren't necessarily compatible between the two,

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.480
update all of your apps, make sure

01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.840
that everything's ready to go.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:42.440
Now, I was reviewing the roadmap on the website,

01:09:42.440 --> 01:09:44.920
and it shows that really OTA 6, I think,

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:46.440
is what it's called, that's really

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:50.360
going to be a release that addresses technical debt.

01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:52.760
I'm curious, what kind of technical debt?

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:56.120
So with the new browser, of course, it's brand new stuff.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.440
There are issues with it.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.120
So we have problems with if you try to change your home page,

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.960
when you click on the box, it flies off the screen

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.200
and weird things like that when the keyboard pops up.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.440
Brand new stuff.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.440
Bugs did find their way in.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.200
So what we're trying to do with OTA 6

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.000
is just make sure that we take care of all of those.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.960
So all of this work is pretty exciting,

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.840
but what are you guys doing?

01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:24.600
What are possible approaches to increase awareness

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.440
so that more people who might be interested in this project, who

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.720
don't already know, might know to try it out

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:31.400
and use this great new release?

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.680
So word of mouth is always the most important.

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:37.760
If you do like Ubuntu Touch, get out there and talk about it.

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.920
We also have a few different outreach projects

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.840
for contributors right now with different channels helping

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:47.120
people get started with development, especially

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:48.760
on Ubuntu Touch.

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.160
Or Hacktoberfest is going on right now with DigitalOcean.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.720
So we've got bugs labeled as Hacktoberfest,

01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.120
which will be nice and easy for people to get started with.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.140
I'm making sure that I put in instructions

01:10:59.140 --> 01:11:01.720
on how to do the contribution, how to get started

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:02.640
with the workflow.

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:04.080
DigitalOcean's Hacktoberfest is being

01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:06.460
used for a couple of different open source projects.

01:11:06.460 --> 01:11:07.840
That's a great way to do it.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:12.080
So Dalton, do you have a sense of about how many users are

01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:15.280
out there in the world using Ubuntu Touch at this point?

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.840
Do you have a rough estimate?

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:18.920
One of the things that we put on our banners

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:21.400
while we're at conferences and things is,

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.440
we don't know who you are, and we want to keep it that way.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:28.120
So we deliberately don't take that much data about users.

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.540
We do have inklings of information

01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:34.960
from our push server, which sends out notifications.

01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.880
But we don't have terribly hard numbers on that.

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.720
What kind of infrastructure does that take?

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:44.240
And is that a cost that is being covered

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:46.440
by a particular sponsor, or is that something

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.640
the project is fronting to run the push servers

01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.360
and the OTA stuff, the back end stuff?

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.880
A lot of our server infrastructure

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:56.120
is sponsored by different providers, DigitalOcean,

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:59.160
packet.net, and Scaleway.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:03.200
So we do have a lot of that covered for us.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.040
The push server itself is actually running

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.520
on DigitalOcean's smallest VPS.

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:12.440
Luckily, it is very light and does its work very well.

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:15.920
However, for the larger things like system image, which

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.920
actually does the OTA upgrades, it

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:20.040
is a significant bandwidth cost.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.880
So we are appreciative of our sponsors and also people

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.240
who support us on Patreon.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:25.200
Very good.

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.580
Patreon sounds like a good way people could directly

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:28.760
support the project.

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:30.080
What's the URL for that?

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:30.800
It is.

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.360
If you want to find links to sponsor us via Patreon,

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:37.560
Bitcoin, or a few others, that's ubiports.com slash

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.280
donate.

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:38.780
I love it.

01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:42.080
Still repping the Bitcoin, even at $6,400 of value.

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.600
You're a good man, Dalton.

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:46.620
So Dalton, I've got a couple of links to your GitHub page,

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:50.560
MrUniversalSuperBox, and other things in the show notes,

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:55.920
like the Ubiport site, the news about the new OTA5 release.

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.920
Is there a Telegram group or any other communities

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.240
you might mention that people are just

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.920
starting to get curious about Ubuntu Touch

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:01.880
they could go check out?

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.380
Yeah.

01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:05.640
You can always join us at at Ubiports on Telegram.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.880
We're Ubiports on most social networks,

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:11.240
including Twitter, Facebook, Mastodon, and just about

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:12.880
anywhere else you'd expect to find us.

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:13.560
Very good, Dalton.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:15.600
Well, thanks for joining us on the Unplugged program.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:16.600
Thanks for having me.

01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:18.400
I follow the project with some interest

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.080
because it seems to me, although there's a few others out there,

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:23.760
you got your Plasma Touches out there

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:27.680
and you got your Purism efforts, I acknowledge.

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:30.480
But I really feel like Ubuntu Touch could

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:34.000
be a great alternative one day for that general purpose Linux

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.400
distro that you can get a piece of hardware and load it on.

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.000
So it's fascinating to watch the project work this stuff out.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.120
And then from my perspective, I'm like, take your time.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:41.640
Get it right.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:43.280
Yeah, I want to come back in, I don't know, a year

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.140
and just maybe have a tablet that runs that I leave around

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:47.840
my house and I have on the couch every day.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:48.840
That'd be perfect.

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:49.400
That would be.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:51.360
That would be pretty neat, pretty neat.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.400
All right, so speaking of things that are pretty neat,

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:58.480
we have something that we're working on behind the scenes.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.040
This whole production pipeline that we have

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:05.240
is manual labor intensive here at the network.

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.960
And now that we're part of Linux Academy,

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.840
one of the things that we want to try to do

01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:11.520
is give back anything we really can of our process

01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:12.740
to the community.

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:14.360
Eventually, perhaps, being able to go,

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:15.860
depending on our time and resources,

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:18.800
be able to go essentially to the level of a guide

01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.760
you could follow to start podcasting under Linux,

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:23.260
how to record, how to get decent audio, how to publish it,

01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:24.720
and then even some tools and scripts

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.320
to help you automate some of the trickier parts.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.840
That's sort of our end-to-end goal way down the line

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.800
as we build these components.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.360
In some cases, we'll just adapt existing projects.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:37.920
In other cases, we might create our own.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:41.180
And we're beginning this project behind the scenes.

01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:44.200
It is really an automation project

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:51.640
to make the process of deploying our episodes as error-free

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.400
as possible, to take out the human element

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:58.120
as much as possible, and to make it so when whoever edits

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.480
the show, like in this case, it'd be Joe,

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.800
when he hits the Publish button, it's

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:05.720
immediately available on all of the destination platforms

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:07.800
that we publish in all of the feeds.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.580
It doesn't require any human intervention, which right now,

01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:11.480
Joe can publish it.

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:13.920
But then somebody here in the JB office

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:15.960
has to go actually publish it to the feeds,

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.520
publish it to the website.

01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:18.560
There's a lot more manual.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:21.840
And it's a lot of copypasta, a lot of filling out feeds.

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:23.400
And eventually, we want to get it

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:27.000
so it automates the encoding, the publishing, and even more.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.160
It's the whole pipeline from going from show notes

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:30.880
to the website.

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:33.240
All of it just is completely automatic.

01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:37.080
And this is going to be a modular monster

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.720
that we build over time.

01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:42.720
And Wes is starting on the first parts of it right now.

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:45.720
And once we start to build this, we'll build it in phases.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.920
We'll build the most time-critical components

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:48.880
that we need automated.

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.680
And then we'll start adding on, doing encoding.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.100
We want to circle back eventually.

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:54.600
If you watch our videos on YouTube,

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:58.280
we have automated renders that have the album art

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:02.400
with a waveform that's like 13 frames a second, which

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.480
is for file size.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:06.520
The beautiful thing is those files are like 75, 80 megabytes.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.400
But the downside is the frame rate sucks.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:11.480
We want to start using the videos

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.820
that we use for like Linux Action News, which is manually

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:17.320
artisan handcraft encoded by Joe.

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:18.440
Each and every week.

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.760
But we want to automate all that and improve that and make

01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:25.260
our process just a little more slicker, a little easier

01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:26.440
to get shows out the door.

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.980
And then we want to release all of it.

01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.640
So to start, I have a couple of bits

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.240
that I want to draw your attention to.

01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:33.200
Number one is we need a name.

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.680
We need a name for a system that automatically publishes shows.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:39.680
And I'd like it to be something we could refer to on Air.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:41.760
It's like we have JBot, for example.

01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.700
We have these other components, which

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:49.160
are well-known components because we've named them.

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:52.340
So I'm trying to come up with a good name for this system.

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:53.920
We've got a code name, but I don't even

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:54.640
want to say what it is.

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:56.440
I don't want to even spoil it with the code name.

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.080
So we've created a form that we'll

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:02.600
have linked in the show notes, linuxunplugged.com slash 271.

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.400
I also just linked it in the IRC room.

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.900
And it's just, what's your nickname?

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:07.780
Because you just want to give somebody credit.

01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:11.120
And what's your suggestion for the automation system's name?

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:12.000
What should we name it?

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.240
And I think if we get a bunch of good ones in there,

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.040
we'll take like the top five or something,

01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:18.040
and then we'll put it to a vote in the episode

01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.200
when I get back from EPSD, if I survive all the Linus jokes.

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.200
But we need your help.

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:24.560
We can't do the naming and all the work of doing.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.240
We tried, actually.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.240
That's just too much.

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:28.480
We tried, and we already bombed.

01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.680
We couldn't come up with any names that were catchy that

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.360
would be like a good term.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:34.640
Because the idea is we're going to publish this up

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.080
on our GitHub page, and we're going

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.600
to make it available for anybody that

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.200
wants to make it a system that automates from show notes

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.560
to publishing.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:46.560
And that's a pretty nuanced process, especially one

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:49.720
that involves album art, and tags, and descriptions,

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:53.600
and chapter markers, and videos, and MP3s, and YouTube,

01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.900
and CDNs, and a lot of different services

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.280
that need integration.

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:01.340
Yeah, so there's a lot actually to it that solves problems.

01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:02.720
And so we want it to be available,

01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:05.800
but we want it to go by a name.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.320
So we're hoping you'll help us name it.

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:10.280
And then we have a bit of a direction change.

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.200
And Mumble Room, this is completely

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:14.600
open to your interpretation and your pushback

01:18:14.600 --> 01:18:16.920
if you think I'm making the wrong decision here.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:20.780
So floor is open to dissenters on this next one here.

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:23.600
But I had me a think recently.

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.160
It's funny really how this kind of works out.

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:30.120
So Eric, the IT guy, has dutifully

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:34.000
built us a very nice GitLab instance

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.680
on a pretty beefy DigitalOcean droplet.

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:39.920
And I bought a cool domain, jupytercode.io, right?

01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.060
I mean, that's pretty cool.

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:44.600
And we were all pretty hot to trot on this.

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.640
And it really came up right around the time

01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:49.680
Microsoft announced their purchase of GitHub.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:53.040
And the infad thing to do was to abandon GitHub

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.640
and go grow your own GitLab instance.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.440
And we thought, yeah, we should do that, too.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:00.200
We should be hosting our own stuff.

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.800
And so he built a great one, and we got backups turned on.

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.080
I mean, it's really well done.

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.400
We've got some projects on there we started with.

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:11.080
And I started having a think last night.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.380
And I was chatting with Wes.

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:14.280
And I was looking at our public GitHub page,

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:17.000
github.com slash jupyterbroadcasting.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.280
Like, you know, there's the caster soundboard on here,

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:22.200
which I'd love for it to get more attention.

01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:23.960
There's the Roku app on here.

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.960
There's the Kodi plug-in on here.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.520
There's already groups and people that have been involved.

01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.400
There's open issues.

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:36.480
Like, this page has been cultivating a small community.

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:39.240
And the reason we were standing up a GitLab instance

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:42.040
was because of this anti-Microsoft hysteria.

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:44.000
And I started having this conversation with Wes.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.200
And I'm thinking, is it actually easier for discovery,

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.120
for the general public, if we have it on GitHub

01:19:50.120 --> 01:19:51.300
when people are looking for this stuff?

01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:54.120
Like, if we build a few tools, because this automation system

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.920
is one of a few tools we're going to be talking about soon,

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.460
we're going to talk about another tool next week

01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.300
that we're building.

01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:01.840
And we're going to also release this open source.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.040
And by the way, we mean GPL.

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.620
We want it to be publicly discoverable.

01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:11.200
We want it to be something that people can get easy access to.

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:12.440
And so I just asked Wes.

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:17.260
I'm like, pros and cons here, Wes, versus GitLab versus GitHub.

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:18.680
And we had a few back and forth.

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:19.800
Like you mentioned, there's a few tools

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.100
we could probably use with GitLab

01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:22.560
that we might not use with GitHub.

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.080
I don't remember exactly what they were.

01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:26.240
I mean, there's a lot of integrated services

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:27.040
with GitLab, right?

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.280
There's CI stuff.

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.160
There's a lot of tweaking you can do,

01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:31.800
because it's a thing you're running yourself.

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:33.180
And GitHub's not that way.

01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:35.400
Plus, there's the geek credit of running something yourself

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.840
versus using a hosted service.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:38.880
And it was all open source.

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:40.880
So we were talking about the pros and cons of it.

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:42.920
And sure enough, I go over to RLinux,

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.080
because I'm having a chat with Wes in one tab.

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.440
And then the other time I go over to RLinux,

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:49.440
I'm just kind of putzing around while waiting for his thoughts.

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.960
And I see a thread in there.

01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:55.780
And it's all caps, reminder, migrate off of GitHub.

01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:57.520
And then it's a thread of over 100

01:20:57.520 --> 01:21:02.400
reactionary, knee-jerk, anti-Microsoft comments.

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.220
Nobody's giving a good technical reason

01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:05.420
why they should migrate off.

01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:07.760
Everybody is just knee-jerk reacting

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.000
to the Microsoft purchase.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.360
They just hate Microsoft.

01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:14.640
And I think I don't want to be part of that anymore.

01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:19.000
At what point do we allow for the possibility of change?

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.440
Open source and free software should

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:25.040
be as much of a social thing as it is a technical thing.

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.800
And at some point, we have to own up

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:30.120
to that social participation factor.

01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:33.240
If we don't, we just seem bigoted and stuck in the mud.

01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.120
And I'm sorry if that comes off as offensive.

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:37.440
But when I read that thread, I was offended.

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.880
I couldn't process it anymore.

01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:41.920
It was just hate for hate's sake.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.400
There was no logical argument.

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.560
Like, the reasons we were bringing up

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.560
were like control over our own instance,

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:51.800
integration with external tools, the geek cred

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.720
for having itself hosted, being divorced

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.400
from a commercial platform.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.000
Like, those were the advantages.

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.600
But that thread had none of that.

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:00.960
It was just the Microsoft hate.

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:05.280
And then I felt a little dirty for even taking this endeavor

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:08.600
because of it was just the thing to do.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.140
It was the end thing, the wave to do.

01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:10.720
It was like, let's do it.

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:11.220
Let's do it.

01:22:11.220 --> 01:22:14.200
And Eric was more than willing to build it for us.

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:15.480
And so we ran.

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:18.040
And then I look back at it now after a cooling off period,

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.440
and I thought, we could actually be doing ourselves harm.

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:23.080
There's a community that's already establishing and growing

01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:23.640
there.

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.920
There's people that have already been submitting issues.

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.320
There's developers who are contributing things.

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:31.000
And it's discoverable on a public forum.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.160
And in the end of the day, it just doesn't make it confusing

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:37.080
either shifting everything or having stuff in multiple places

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.920
was just more complexity than we were getting benefit out of.

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.800
And we constantly have to make decisions over,

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:43.840
when do we use services?

01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:45.760
Or when do we roll something ourselves?

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:48.080
And this just isn't a huge part of the stuff.

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:49.960
Like, we're not running a GitLab.

01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:52.200
It's just not something that we need to be doing.

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:54.280
And if there's a point in time that we want to,

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:54.960
GitLab's great.

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:57.200
And we would have no problem using it.

01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.560
It's wonderful that we have that opportunity and that option.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.880
We may even keep a mirror just for our own backup, really.

01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:02.760
Something we've been checking.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.960
Well, maybe we might keep it, but just for ourselves.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.540
That's something we could totally do.

01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:08.600
By the way, if in next week's episode

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:13.040
we mention the GitLab URL, sorry about that.

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:14.880
We recorded that before Future Chris had

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.600
changed his mind on this thing.

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:17.880
So I don't know if that might be confusing.

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:19.080
The show notes will be accurate.

01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:21.800
So you can go get actual links, even if we say the wrong thing.

01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:24.180
You know what we should do is have Joe go back and just

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:26.640
record over with the right URL, which would be hilarious.

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:27.560
It'll be Joe's voice.

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.320
Yes, that would be so good.

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.920
No, but really the URL you want to go to

01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:33.680
is going to be github.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:36.160
And there's a couple things that are coming there right now.

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:38.040
There's a new project that's up there that we'll

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.360
be talking about next week.

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.400
That already has a name, so that's up in public.

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:43.400
And there's a couple of things that I myself

01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:45.720
have committed to it that I was so proud.

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:48.440
It's possible because it's all Bash script in that case.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.160
And then Caster Soundboard is back up there again.

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:54.320
And boy, oh boy, I would really love it

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.520
if people wanted to take a look at Caster Soundboard.

01:23:56.520 --> 01:23:58.320
It could use some love.

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:02.000
It is a great piece of software with a ton of potential.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.280
But the UI has got a lot going on.

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.080
And it could really use the ability

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.880
to select sound interfaces.

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:09.860
The great thing about it is the changes

01:24:09.860 --> 01:24:12.460
and builds that people commit get packaged up as a snap.

01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:13.960
And so it is available still as a snap.

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.840
So that's actually been something we've

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:18.280
been able to use here in Studio.

01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:19.740
It just has a few tweaks.

01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:21.660
Like not being able to change the sound interface

01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:23.320
is a killer one for us.

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:25.960
But we have projects up there, including Kodi plugins,

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:26.800
all of it.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:29.720
We're going to try to start coming around to over time.

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:31.260
Our mode of operation right now is

01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:32.840
we're going to fix a few things in our own house,

01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:35.080
clean up a few things, get that built,

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:37.840
get that up on our GitHub page, and make it available to people.

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:40.940
And then over time, expand out from there, start new projects.

01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:45.000
But also, we want to start contributing in other ways

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.200
to other projects, maybe not just in code,

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:47.920
but in other ways.

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.800
So that'll all be stuff down the road.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:52.560
But for right now, it starts with you helping

01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:54.480
us name our automation system.

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.520
We'll have a link, linuxunplug.com, slash 271.

01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.400
Or I'll drop it in the IRC again if you

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:00.440
want to go submit a name.

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:03.200
And then maybe we'll vote in a couple of weeks

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.120
when I get back.

01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:05.160
Pretty excited about that.

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.200
But what do you guys think in the Mumble Room

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:10.840
as far as abandoning my plan to go to GitLab

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.280
and sticking with GitHub for now?

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:15.060
Does anybody have initial thoughts on that?

01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:18.240
Well, the thing that I would say is that the GitLab has

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:22.440
a lot of more tools and better issue tracking.

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:25.200
You can switch around issues and everything.

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:29.120
So in that regard, I really like GitLab for that reason,

01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:31.920
not because of Microsoft owning whatever,

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.240
but because of the tools.

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:37.320
And I would say that Microsoft buying GitHub

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:40.000
was a push to test out other stuff.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.120
But I think the test really proved it valuable.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.840
Yeah, I think that is one of the parts I'm

01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:52.320
the most concerned about is I was really dreaming up

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:54.880
some great uses for the issue tracker stuff.

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:58.080
That was an area I thought we could expand quite a bit.

01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:00.160
So maybe that's an area we still use it for.

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:00.840
Right.

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.200
I mean, this doesn't have to be permanent.

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.000
I think the biggest thing is just

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.440
I think we realized a little bit that we had some stuff, more

01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:08.600
stuff going for us over at GitHub that we realized.

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:10.560
So we can build and grow there.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:12.760
And if we decide that GitLab is a tool that we really

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:15.040
want to use, well, we already have it.

01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:17.040
Yeah, it seems like it's worth keeping around

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.640
for other reasons besides just the projects,

01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.520
but also as sort of like a backup.

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.600
And people are right in the chat room

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:26.680
that, yes, GitLab also runs their own service as a website.

01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:28.400
So we could go host it over there.

01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:30.520
I think that's a little more comparable to just using

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:31.040
GitHub.

01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.560
Due to that, it's just feature sets

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.360
because they're both proprietary services.

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:38.720
It comes back to the same old frustrating argument

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:41.000
that seems to be particularly hard for the open source

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.440
community to have, and that is the network effect.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.600
That's why people still log into Skype.

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:50.440
That's why people still use all of these services that

01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:55.000
are closed and spy on you is because of the network effect.

01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.320
And that was the realization I had.

01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:00.000
It's not like it's huge over at GitHub,

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.760
but it was beginning to roll.

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.300
And people were interacting with it,

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:04.600
and it was seeing some success.

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:06.420
And I just thought, it's already starting

01:27:06.420 --> 01:27:07.880
to experience that network effect.

01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.720
Plus, you have the overall network effect

01:27:09.720 --> 01:27:11.320
of being on the GitHub site.

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:13.480
People might, in some cases, just

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:16.720
assume that's where you go.

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:19.240
And so to me, that was the cincher.

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:21.440
But I'm not totally convinced.

01:27:21.440 --> 01:27:25.640
So it's an area that's open for future consideration.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:29.040
And the nice thing is, until we get super in-depth with things

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.280
like issues or wikis or other formats,

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.280
as long as we're just using it for repo hosting,

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:34.880
all of this is easy to change.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.680
Yeah, we have such a cool thing that we're

01:27:36.680 --> 01:27:38.520
working on right now that we'll talk to you

01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:40.320
about in next week's episode.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:43.320
But before we get out of here, I wanted

01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:46.960
to tell you about this Photoshop for Linux replacement

01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:47.880
that I found.

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:48.920
Really, for Linux, that's not fair.

01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:49.400
That's not.

01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.120
I mean, you can use it on Linux.

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:52.800
So that part's true.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.160
You could use it on any desktop.

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:56.120
You sure can.

01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.320
I'm going to say it's pronounced Photopea.

01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.320
What about Photopea?

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:00.400
Photopea.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.040
Oh, you're right.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:02.680
It's probably, god, I'm so proud of that.

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:04.800
Honestly, I read it the same way that you did, though.

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:05.560
I don't know why.

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:08.000
And I don't know how, maybe they don't have guidance.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:08.640
No, no.

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:09.200
No, no.

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.560
There's no reason to pronounce it Photopea now

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:12.440
that you say Photopea.

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.880
No, you're completely right.

01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:14.920
You're completely right.

01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:17.840
It's funny, because you just don't really,

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.520
you never know what's going to come out of my head.

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:20.800
You never know what it's going to come up

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:22.120
with when it reads something.

01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:23.880
So I just kind of roll with it.

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:26.280
This looks a lot like Photoshop.

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:27.520
And it's in your web browser.

01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:28.840
Now, I'm going to just put that out there.

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:29.840
It's in your web browser.

01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:31.680
Calm down, because I know about GIMP.

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:32.360
Calm down.

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:33.440
I know about Inkscape.

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:34.200
Calm down.

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:35.720
I know about Corita.

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.680
Let me explain myself here.

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:42.160
You see, class, as I switched to Linux a while back,

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:45.320
one really sticking area that I've always been fiddling with

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:48.720
is all of the PSD files that we have.

01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:51.520
Every artist who's ever created anything for us ever

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:53.480
has always sent it in a PSD file.

01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.400
We might get an SVG file.

01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:58.640
The only time we've ever received

01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:01.680
a logo that wasn't in PSD was the time

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:04.000
that Dan refreshed the user error graphics

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.240
and sent us something that was.

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:08.840
That's literally the only time is when Daniel sent us

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:09.840
something.

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:11.960
And I assume because he made it under free software.

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:15.120
I don't actually know what tool it changed.

01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:16.360
I don't think he told me.

01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:16.840
But anyway.

01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:17.240
He ducked out.

01:29:17.240 --> 01:29:18.920
It's probably Inkscape, though.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:19.400
Yeah.

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:19.600
OK.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.520
Thanks, Cassidy.

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:23.680
Anyways, that's literally it and everything else, everything

01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:26.840
from any of the shows we've ever had, any of the individual assets.

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.640
They're all in PSD files.

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:32.400
And for the most part, anything that

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.200
involves complicated text editing really falls down

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:38.280
in GIMP or Corita.

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:39.600
Corita won't even edit the text.

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:40.400
It just doesn't even happen.

01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:42.160
It'll display it, but it won't edit it.

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:44.040
GIMP has an extremely hard time.

01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:47.880
And initially, I thought I'd be OK with the GIMP support

01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:51.440
because most things seem to be working when I would open up in GIMP.

01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:55.360
As time went on, I realized, especially as I would go back

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:58.360
to some of the older stuff, it, in some cases, was butchering it.

01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.960
And I didn't know it until I would render it out and save it.

01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:02.720
And then I'd send it to somebody and say, what the hell is this?

01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:04.880
It was kind of embarrassing because I sent it to a graphic artist.

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:07.120
And I'm like, what the hell is this?

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:08.480
They're like, what are you talking about?

01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:09.680
It's not that bad of a logo.

01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:12.240
I mean, I know I think it could use a refresh.

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:14.680
And then they sent it back to me.

01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:17.760
So I essentially started down the path of trying

01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:21.200
to get Photoshop working under wine, which, boy, is that a backache.

01:30:21.200 --> 01:30:22.720
Just a lot of one.

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:25.600
If you can get your hands on Photoshop 7, which I could not.

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:28.560
You know, I don't spend a lot of time checking the backs of trucks

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:30.560
on the internet anymore.

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:35.800
Free Software has dulled my skills of finding Windows, Juarez.

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:38.280
And so I could not find Photoshop 7.

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.080
It made me feel like an old man.

01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:43.480
And trying to get Creative Cloud installed under Linux is a joke.

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:46.120
So I'm really glad I'm getting the full benefit out

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:48.320
of that Creative Cloud subscription.

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:51.120
Kept digging around for alternatives, trying to figure out if I could just

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:54.960
really what I did is I spent the most time trying to make it work under Kim.

01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:59.400
Eventually, though, I came around to Photopea, Photopea.com.

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:03.080
It was a bit of a shaggy dog discovery because I first discovered them

01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:05.840
on GitHub as I was going through GitHub looking at different projects

01:31:05.840 --> 01:31:07.380
and their PSD support.

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:09.640
And they have some open source projects, which maybe I'll get

01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:13.320
Wes to talk about here in a second, but their main core application

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.320
is not open source.

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:15.640
It is closed source.

01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:18.440
And so I just happened to check out their website for some reason

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:22.320
and discovered that they basically have built Photoshop in the web browser.

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:27.920
And it has full support for PSD files, for GIMP XCF files, for.sketch files,

01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:32.120
for any SVG, TIFF, JPEG, PNG, DNG, you name it.

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.600
It's got support for it.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.160
And it'll open them up from your local machine.

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:38.600
You don't have to upload it to a cloud storage first.

01:31:38.600 --> 01:31:40.360
It'll upload it from your local file system.

01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:41.800
Yeah, this all just happens locally.

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.520
It's just a JavaScript app running.

01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:44.960
There's not a cloud component.

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:47.920
You can actually disconnect your computer from the internet

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:49.160
once this app is loaded.

01:31:49.160 --> 01:31:51.600
And as long as you don't close the tab, it will continue to work.

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:52.580
It's pretty great.

01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:58.620
And I was able to open up a Photoshop file that has always only worked

01:31:58.620 --> 01:31:59.840
under Photoshop.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.120
I'm telling you guys, I was getting so desperate.

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.120
I was preparing to do the Mac in the cloud.

01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.200
Have you heard about this service?

01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:05.840
I do.

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:08.120
This is something that Mike told me about on Coda Radio.

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.640
This is his solution, because he switched over to elementary OS

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:11.880
as his daily driver.

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:15.000
But he's still got to build and sign iOS applications for his customers.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:16.160
And you've got to be on a Mac.

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:19.900
So he got a Mac and a cloud subscription, where it's just like a Mac mini

01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:22.280
that he gets accelerated remote desktop.

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:25.400
So there's just some racks of Mac minis out there just so people can do them.

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:26.120
Yeah.

01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:29.480
And he's able to do it through his web browser on his Linux desktop.

01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:29.960
Nice.

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:34.080
So I was thinking, that is a ridiculous way

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:37.240
to get access to all of these legacy PSD files.

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:41.960
But I was starting to consider it, because about once a week,

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:44.800
I need access to something in this catalog.

01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:46.880
And I generally need access right away, because it's

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:49.360
somebody asking me for something, or a show needs to go out,

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:50.560
and it needs something.

01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:53.800
And I thought, OK, maybe this is one way I could avoid this.

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:56.480
If I can't find Photoshop 7, I was desperate.

01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:59.400
So when I came across Photopea, and I opened up that PSD file,

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:04.520
I edited that text field, and then I saved it out as a JPEG,

01:33:04.520 --> 01:33:06.520
I signed up for the Pro account.

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:09.240
And I got you in there, and I got Joe in there,

01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:10.360
and I got Brent in there.

01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:14.360
So that way, we could all try it out and really kind of kick

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:15.720
the tires on this thing.

01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:18.800
And before we get into some of the open source projects they're involved in,

01:33:18.800 --> 01:33:21.200
I kind of want to hear what Brent thought of it.

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:23.720
Because I got to imagine there's been times, Brent, when

01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:25.800
you're working with photos, you've wished that Photoshop

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.280
has been available for Linux.

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:30.200
Not that GIMP isn't great, but that's got to have crossed your mind.

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:32.600
And I'm wondering if this scratched that itch a little bit,

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:34.200
or if it fell short for you.

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:35.720
Good question.

01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:39.240
My first reaction to this was, well, it's not actually that interesting to me,

01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:41.840
because I've been on open source software for such a long time,

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:47.240
and I work basically all in my own little silo.

01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:49.680
But then I was thinking about all these little edge cases.

01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:52.760
And I remember when I was switching from Photoshop

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:55.160
and those proprietary tools into open source,

01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:59.960
it was this strange gray area where a lot of the work that I was doing

01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:01.960
was still in PSDs and things like that.

01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:06.240
And then I was trying to move over without necessarily having

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:09.720
a license to the software, because I was trying to get away from it.

01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.280
So then I thought, oh, wait a second.

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:13.600
This actually might be really useful for a lot of people.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:18.880
And surprisingly, it is fairly functional for, I guess,

01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:20.720
what could be described as a web application.

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:25.040
Yeah, I opened up some PDFs in there, opened some various just random images

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:26.320
that I have.

01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:27.160
It's pretty nice.

01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.400
I will also say that they do a good job.

01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:32.480
It's fairly responsive, especially for a browser app.

01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:35.920
And when you're loading something like a PostScript file or a PDF

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.600
and it doesn't have the right fonts, it's very clear about what's happening,

01:34:38.600 --> 01:34:40.520
which ones you're missing and what it's substituting.

01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:41.400
Yes, thank you for bringing that up.

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:43.120
Because one of the things it will do is it will go out

01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.840
to various resources on the internet and try to match it.

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:49.560
And if it can't, it'll try to match it with the closest free alternative,

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:50.520
which is pretty neat.

01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:51.200
That is nice.

01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:52.360
It's a nice system there.

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:56.400
So all in all, Brent, any other impressions you took away from using it?

01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.080
Did it feel like a decent tool to you?

01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.560
Or did it feel a little weak?

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:02.200
Yeah, when you asked me to look at this,

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:03.680
I actually ended up taking a whole bunch of notes

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:06.060
because I thought, oh, jeez, this is really interesting.

01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:09.720
So my first observation is that I ended up

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:12.440
using a whole bunch of keyboard shortcuts, which

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:16.240
is how I usually use GIMP or Darktable and things like that.

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:22.800
But I ended up about half of them worked in this web UI, which was great.

01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:27.600
But then I kept trying to zoom in and stuff, which is just control and scrolling.

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.760
And then I ended up, it didn't quite work.

01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:32.600
So I took that at first like, oh, that's kind of a bummer.

01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:34.200
But then I thought, oh, wait.

01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:38.480
I feel so at home in this web app that my brain doesn't even

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:43.120
know the difference between using the web app and a native application.

01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:46.160
So I thought, oh, jeez, they're doing a good job here if I can't even,

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:48.680
you know, I forget after 30 seconds.

01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:52.080
Yeah, you could wrap it up in a Native Fire script

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:55.040
and get away with thinking it was a local application with layer

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:56.400
palettes and colored settings.

01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:57.680
It's a complicated UI.

01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:59.920
I mean, it's an impressive little app.

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:02.480
And so they do have a few things they're contributing open source

01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:03.080
that you found.

01:36:03.080 --> 01:36:04.600
Yeah, they have a GitHub account.

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:07.200
I mean, again, it was easy to find as a result of that.

01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:10.080
Just nothing crazy, but they've got some typesetting scripts

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:13.560
to work with OTF or TrueType fonts.

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:14.960
They've got a TIFF decoder.

01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:16.280
You can go poke around and see.

01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:18.960
It's a lot of gnarly JavaScript.

01:36:18.960 --> 01:36:21.120
Yeah, it's some really complicated stuff.

01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:23.360
But then again, that's exactly the kind of thing

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:25.640
you want somebody else to do all the hard lifting on.

01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:27.240
I was excited, honestly, just for, you know,

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:29.040
there's all kinds of, I know how to convert files, right?

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:29.880
I know how to use GIMP.

01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.320
Like, if I need to make an ICO or I

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:32.720
need to convert something for someone,

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:33.920
I have the tools to do that.

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:36.000
But if you already have access to this,

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.880
it can also be really nice for users when, like,

01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:39.280
you can load from a URL, then you

01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:40.560
could quickly save out another file

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:43.280
that you needed to convert, even on whatever computer you're at.

01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:44.800
So that part seems nice, too.

01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.320
There's a couple other interesting things about it,

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:47.560
just as we wrap up.

01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:51.000
Number one is they offer it as a white label service.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:54.520
So you can white label this and re-post it.

01:36:54.520 --> 01:36:58.320
And then they also offer a decent API.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:36:59.040
So you could.

01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.160
We'll have to play with that.

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:02.880
Yeah, it's a photo editor with an API in the web browser,

01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:07.640
Photopea, if you want it, P-E-A, if you want to try it out.

01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:10.800
And again, I'm not saying it's replacing your GIMP.

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:13.680
I'm saying it's supplementing when sometimes that PSD

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:15.280
file just won't open.

01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:17.640
Or you want something that works a little bit more

01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:18.680
like Photoshop 7.

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.680
So if your brain knows that Photoshop 7 style layout,

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:22.640
this is pretty much it.

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.280
It's like Photoshop Lite a little bit.

01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:27.880
Just the stuff you actually used in Photoshop.

01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:30.000
There are two other things I really liked about it

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:31.800
that I just want to mention quickly.

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:34.360
One of them, which is I tend to read terms of services

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:35.360
for these things.

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:36.920
And it was nice and short and concise.

01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:39.520
But one of the things I loved was one of the first lines

01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.440
was the content is yours.

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:43.360
These terms, I'm going to read it now.

01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:44.720
These terms don't grant us.

01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:47.120
And we don't claim any ownership rights on your content,

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.960
which some of the other applications,

01:37:48.960 --> 01:37:50.080
it's a gray area there.

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:51.080
Yeah, good catch.

01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:51.680
Good thinking.

01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:52.840
I bet you would check that.

01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:56.960
Well, that's an important part of any creative audience.

01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.840
But then the other part that, Chris, I think

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:01.680
you would really like this is if you end up

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:03.480
logging in with one of the accounts

01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:07.000
that they support, which is Google or Facebook or GitHub.

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:08.360
GitHub I thought was interesting.

01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:11.160
But they will store your preferences

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.200
across different sessions.

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:14.920
So you can be on multiple computers

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.920
and still have all of your preferences

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:19.280
synced between all of those, which I thought was great.

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:20.320
I do like that.

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.160
I do like that.

01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:25.360
That is, this is probably how I will be tweaking show art

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:27.400
while I'm on the road, I think, to meet BSD.

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:29.440
I think this is what I'm going to do.

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.720
This is probably it right here.

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.520
Well, thank you, Brent, for taking a look.

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:33.480
I like that.

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:36.920
Go get more Popey and Mr. Wimpy and Mark II

01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:38.200
over at the Ubuntu podcast.

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:39.600
Wimpy, you know what you ought to do

01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.960
is you ought to invite that Dan Fore guy on the show.

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:44.240
And you should ask him the really hard questions.

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:46.080
Spoilers.

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:47.720
I'm just saying you should think about it.

01:38:47.720 --> 01:38:48.720
Just think about it.

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:49.200
I'm not saying.

01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:50.120
Already thought about it.

01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:50.640
Oh, OK.

01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:52.920
Check back in in two days' time.

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:54.160
Oh, you know.

01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:54.760
Are you kidding?

01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.080
I listen on day one.

01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:57.360
I listen the day it comes out.

01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:58.000
I will.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:38:59.440
Yeah, I listen on Thursday.

01:38:59.440 --> 01:38:59.960
Good, good.

01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:04.760
And Cassidy, anywhere you want to send folks to check out,

01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:05.600
I don't know.

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:06.360
You got a new release.

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:07.240
You got a Patreon page.

01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:08.200
You got a lot going on.

01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:09.580
You got a machine.

01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:10.920
You're raising funds for anything

01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:12.080
you want to just give a plug out to.

01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:13.680
Give it out there because you've stayed for the whole show.

01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:15.440
You deserve it.

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:19.080
I mean, just head to elementary.io to check out Juno.

01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:22.200
And there's the release post is linked to from there.

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:25.760
And otherwise, you can find me at Twitter.com

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:29.240
slash CassidyJames or over on the soon-to-be-dead Google

01:39:29.240 --> 01:39:31.760
Plus at CassidyJames as well.

01:39:31.760 --> 01:39:32.480
Too soon.

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:33.280
Hey, you know what?

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:35.760
By the way, I was following your tweets about the Pixel 3

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:36.280
camera.

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:37.320
You are right.

01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:39.160
That is some amazing stuff.

01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:40.200
It's pretty bonkers.

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:40.800
It is.

01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:41.440
It is.

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.760
So Cassidy was calling out some of the tricks they're doing.

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:44.680
It's just incredible.

01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:45.640
You're going to make me get one.

01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:46.280
Yeah, yeah.

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:48.080
Go read his Twitter feed.

01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:49.440
You're going to be pretty impressed.

01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:49.720
All right.

01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:51.080
Well, I'll mention my Twitter.

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:52.080
I'm at Chris Elias.

01:39:52.080 --> 01:39:52.960
He's at Westpane.

01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:55.600
You can go get more of him at techsnap.systems.

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.520
And of course, everything we talked about today

01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:59.960
linked at linuxunplugged.com slash 271,

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:02.360
including your name submissions for our project.

01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:04.000
We really do want those.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.600
I'll be out at MeetBSD next week,

01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:08.320
but we will have a recorded episode released for you.

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:10.560
And then I'll be back the Tuesday after that

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:13.040
with our regular live show.

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.840
So do come back.

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:16.060
Join us in that virtual log.

01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:18.600
You can just Google Mumble Jupiter Colony,

01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:19.400
and it'll come up.

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:20.620
It's easy peasy.

01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:24.240
And then the chat room during the show is irc.geekshed.net

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:26.720
pound hashtag.

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.240
Number sign, Jupiter Broadcasting.

01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:29.680
You go in there, you chat with us.

01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:30.920
We chat with you.

01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:32.280
It's a good show.

01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:33.480
It's a good time.

01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:35.840
But it's even better if you're there.

01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:37.400
It's even better.

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:38.400
Thanks for joining us.

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:41.000
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.620
Take care.

01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:21.820
Oh, it's a big show. That's one of our longer ones just happen, and I just told John

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:23.820
I'm gonna try to keep it to an hour 10

01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:29.480
You're just trolling a male. You know what's funny is we recorded two Linux unplugs last week

01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:34.740
We had the regular show and then we had to make the the makeup show for the week that we're I'm out and we're like

01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:37.880
What the hell are we gonna talk about? We're gonna have no show next week. We just did two shows boom

01:41:38.340 --> 01:41:42.700
There's a huge show but echo we were talking on the pre show about KX studio a little bit

01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:46.060
Which has been helpful and we're gonna talk about that next week a little bit

01:41:46.060 --> 01:41:48.060
It's been helpful for us here in the studio

01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:54.900
And you were saying that that is a one-person shop over at cake studio, which is mind-blowing. Yeah, it's a fault

01:41:54.900 --> 01:42:00.580
Fuck FA out. I forget. He's like super cool in the IRC. He's been really helpful

01:42:00.580 --> 01:42:06.980
Although man fuck TX otherwise known as Felipe Kaleo. That is that wow that is amazing a lot of hard work

01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:13.180
It's a kick studio is a great set of plugins and repositories and packages to make audio production and real-time audio production

01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:20.100
Doable under Linux and it's a big part of what we're using these days. So oh man, that's great

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:23.260
that's it's amazing what one person can do in open source and

01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:43.260
At the same time makes you really want to go over there and contribute somehow. It really does
