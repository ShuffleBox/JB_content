WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.920
How's the packing going, Brent?

00:01.920 --> 00:05.040
You on track to make it tonight?

00:05.040 --> 00:07.440
I think actually the packing is the easy part.

00:07.440 --> 00:08.720
No, I'm not going to make it tonight.

00:08.720 --> 00:09.680
There's no way.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.720
With the postal up crash and all the things

00:12.720 --> 00:16.080
that I'm hoping to do, I am going to fail you.

00:16.080 --> 00:17.520
I think it's going to be a morning thing.

00:17.520 --> 00:20.080
I like that you're just scheduling in the post-show crash.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.200
Like, that's a good idea.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.200
That shows he's an experienced podcaster.

00:23.200 --> 00:23.680
Oh, yeah.

00:23.680 --> 00:25.920
I mean, you know how real that is, right?

00:25.920 --> 00:26.800
It's essential.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.840
So I don't know.

00:29.840 --> 00:32.000
So the plan originally was we'd do the show.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.160
This is always how these planning sessions go,

00:34.160 --> 00:35.120
is we're planning.

00:35.120 --> 00:36.400
And it's like, so yeah, then you could just

00:36.400 --> 00:38.240
head out like after the show and then hit the road.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.440
Should be no big deal, right?

00:39.440 --> 00:41.040
And because I'm always, this always happens to me too.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.080
It's like, oh, yeah, no problem.

00:42.080 --> 00:42.880
Yeah, that's fine.

00:42.880 --> 00:45.040
And then you get to the day of and you're like,

00:45.040 --> 00:47.520
there's no effing way I'm leaving after the show.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.840
Even though I've been prepping all week, there's no way.

00:49.840 --> 00:52.400
I mean, one, it means you have to have everything packed,

00:52.400 --> 00:53.200
right?

00:53.200 --> 00:53.840
Yeah, right.

00:53.840 --> 00:54.800
Oh, I'm sorry, Brent.

00:54.800 --> 00:55.600
But you know what?

00:55.600 --> 00:57.600
What you got to do is set yourself

00:57.600 --> 00:59.920
like a timed windows to pack.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.760
And then you just, you know, you take breaks.

01:01.760 --> 01:02.560
You'll get through it.

01:02.560 --> 01:03.280
You'll make it.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.400
Or just don't bring anything.

01:04.400 --> 01:07.040
You know, just go freestyle.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.560
Just throw caution to the wind.

01:08.560 --> 01:11.840
I did give my car a car wash, so there's that at least.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.360
Hey, you'll come in style.

01:13.360 --> 01:24.880
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:24.880 --> 01:25.680
My name is Chris.

01:25.680 --> 01:26.640
My name is Wes.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.000
And my name is Brent.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.280
Hello, gentlemen.

01:29.280 --> 01:31.440
I'm talking like this today because it's a very exciting

01:31.440 --> 01:31.920
show.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.320
Hello, perhaps.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.240
We have some desktop woes that we're

01:36.240 --> 01:38.080
going to share with you today.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.160
And we're going to be talking about some of the things

01:40.160 --> 01:41.920
that we're going to be talking about today.

01:41.920 --> 01:44.160
Some desktop woes that we're going to share with you

01:44.160 --> 01:47.040
that have struck recently, we'll just say.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.360
And we have some thoughts on some new hardware that's

01:49.360 --> 01:51.200
going to get drafted for some space work.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.720
We have some bugs to file.

01:52.720 --> 01:53.760
There's a lot to do today.

01:53.760 --> 01:56.400
And we're going to round it all out with some great boosts,

01:56.400 --> 01:57.840
some pics, and more.

01:57.840 --> 01:59.200
So before we get any further, let's

01:59.200 --> 02:01.840
say time-appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

02:01.840 --> 02:02.880
Hello, Mumble Room.

02:02.880 --> 02:03.760
Hello, hello.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.720
Hey, Chris.

02:04.720 --> 02:06.240
Hey, Wes, and hey, Brent.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.840
Time-appropriate greetings, everybody.

02:07.840 --> 02:09.040
Hello, hello.

02:09.040 --> 02:10.240
Thank you for joining us.

02:10.240 --> 02:12.080
Thank you to everybody watching over at jupyter.tube

02:12.080 --> 02:13.520
as we stream it live.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.080
And a good morning to our friends over at TailScale.

02:16.080 --> 02:19.640
TailScale is a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard's noise

02:19.640 --> 02:20.800
protocol.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.680
Noise?

02:21.680 --> 02:22.760
It's a noise protocol.

02:22.760 --> 02:23.680
I just think that's so great.

02:23.680 --> 02:24.160
We love it.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.200
We use it every single day.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.880
I think it's going to change your game.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.320
I think it's up there with R-Sync and SSH.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.080
Go check out TailScale, tailscale.com.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.400
Get it for free on 20 devices.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.040
And tell them the Unplugged program sent you.

02:36.040 --> 02:39.240
So we have an interesting story to talk about this week.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.800
It seems that NASA has selected SciFive,

02:41.800 --> 02:46.000
makers of RISC-V systems, as maybe the potential go-to

02:46.000 --> 02:48.920
ecosystem for future space hardware.

02:48.920 --> 02:51.960
And of course, that's obviously going to be running Linux.

02:51.960 --> 02:55.520
And SciFive, they're like over the moon on this one.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.240
They say that their devices are going

02:57.240 --> 03:01.960
to offer a 100x increase in computational capacity.

03:01.960 --> 03:04.360
Well, yeah, if you remember when we were talking with Tim,

03:04.360 --> 03:06.240
he was mentioning where Linux was kind of running

03:06.240 --> 03:07.860
on this off-the-shelf hardware, but they

03:07.860 --> 03:11.800
had these pretty much ancient PowerPC processors

03:11.800 --> 03:14.240
that were all radiation-hardened.

03:14.240 --> 03:17.160
But those are getting pretty old, and we need something new.

03:17.160 --> 03:19.240
And so yeah, kind of the customizability

03:19.240 --> 03:23.000
of the RISC-V platform, they can make something

03:23.000 --> 03:26.240
that's a huge speed improvement, but also still

03:26.240 --> 03:30.440
meet all of the strenuous needs of interplanetary travel.

03:30.440 --> 03:31.880
There's a lot I like about this.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.880
First of all, I think this is just a great platform

03:34.880 --> 03:35.680
for them to pick.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.840
It's something that'll be around a long time,

03:37.840 --> 03:39.880
and it's an open platform.

03:39.880 --> 03:42.520
And it's going to encourage driver development for Linux

03:42.520 --> 03:44.880
and all those things, which is really great.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.520
And it's one of the things that when an organization like NASA

03:47.520 --> 03:50.720
selects a hardware platform, it kind of just

03:50.720 --> 03:52.720
it means we're going to see a base level of support

03:52.720 --> 03:54.520
for a very long time.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.720
So that's really great.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.840
I think the other thing that's really kind of excellent

03:58.840 --> 04:01.520
about this is I would expect it's

04:01.520 --> 04:04.520
going to bring more developers into RISC-V. It's going to mean

04:04.520 --> 04:06.240
they're going to have more people that are learning how

04:06.240 --> 04:09.400
to write RISC-V of applications and systems.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.120
Like I think, I don't know if the halo effect of this

04:12.120 --> 04:14.120
is the right term, but I think just the effect,

04:14.120 --> 04:16.280
the second order effects of NASA doing this

04:16.280 --> 04:18.440
and requiring software developed for it

04:18.440 --> 04:21.280
means that there's just going to be more of an ecosystem

04:21.280 --> 04:22.560
investment in RISC now.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.160
Seems like nice timing too, just as they're

04:24.160 --> 04:26.040
sort of gaining confidence in deploying Linux

04:26.040 --> 04:29.960
in some of these environments, plus now deploying RISC-V.

04:29.960 --> 04:31.440
And we know Linux has been putting in,

04:31.440 --> 04:33.020
there's been many developers putting in some time

04:33.020 --> 04:35.600
to get Linux's RISC-V support up and going.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.400
I think you're right, that's only going to accelerate.

04:37.400 --> 04:40.320
Wouldn't it be interesting if the story of RISC-V

04:40.320 --> 04:42.240
is like this slow one?

04:42.240 --> 04:46.040
You know, you start seeing it in these rovers, helicopters,

04:46.040 --> 04:48.960
or whatever they might use it on, moon buggies.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.880
But wouldn't it be funny if it takes like 20 years,

04:52.880 --> 04:54.280
I mean not funny, but wouldn't it just figure

04:54.280 --> 04:58.760
it takes like 10, 20 years of using RISC-V in this capacity,

04:58.760 --> 05:00.620
starts as hard drive controllers,

05:00.620 --> 05:01.840
and then it kind of works its way up.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.360
And you know, by now we're starting to see

05:03.360 --> 05:05.480
those single board computers, but not very many of them,

05:05.480 --> 05:06.600
and they're very specialized.

05:06.600 --> 05:11.000
And it's just the slowest of the slow burns,

05:11.000 --> 05:13.600
but it does actually seem to be going

05:13.600 --> 05:15.200
in the upwards direction.

05:15.200 --> 05:16.320
It seems like it's kind of, you know,

05:16.320 --> 05:19.480
the hardware world, CPUs, it just takes time.

05:19.480 --> 05:22.620
Devices have, you know, they age in place to some extent,

05:22.620 --> 05:25.640
and then just to get the adoption to meet the standards.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.240
You know, ARM's dominating the world now,

05:27.240 --> 05:28.240
but there were times where just like,

05:28.240 --> 05:29.840
oh, that's that funny embedded CPU.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.840
I mean, don't do anything serious with that.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.080
Yeah, maybe so, you're right.

05:33.080 --> 05:35.480
And I wonder if it isn't even a longer,

05:35.480 --> 05:39.600
upper hill battle now, because there is so much momentum

05:39.600 --> 05:43.200
around X86, and ARM, and PowerPC.

05:43.200 --> 05:48.040
There's so much already established momentum development

05:48.040 --> 05:50.360
ecosystem that for something to come along

05:50.360 --> 05:53.280
and truly get widespread adoption,

05:53.280 --> 05:55.360
it takes some of that stuff aging out.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.920
It takes some of that stuff just kind of fading away.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.780
The developer talent leaving,

06:00.780 --> 06:01.840
it's not like they have an incentive

06:01.840 --> 06:03.320
to switch to RISC-V right away.

06:03.320 --> 06:05.280
So it would make sense that as these trends

06:05.280 --> 06:08.880
and these technologies become more entrenched over time,

06:08.880 --> 06:12.000
that something new coming along is gonna have

06:12.000 --> 06:14.440
a much longer road before it really gets

06:14.440 --> 06:15.880
significant market share.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.480
It's gonna be a while, but this is a huge first step.

06:19.440 --> 06:20.560
I wonder if Tim will have any thoughts

06:20.560 --> 06:22.200
when we get down to JPL and talk to him about it.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.840
We'll have to bend his ear on this one.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.040
We are gonna be there soon.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.160
We have not left the road for the road yet,

06:27.160 --> 06:30.160
but we do leave soon after next week's episode.

06:30.160 --> 06:34.280
So we're doing a double next Sunday over at jupyter.tube.

06:34.280 --> 06:36.120
We're recording two Linux unplugs,

06:36.120 --> 06:38.580
so that way we have one recorded while we're on the road.

06:38.580 --> 06:39.560
Just give us a little drive time.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.660
Yeah, you know, if you're not always able to make it live,

06:42.660 --> 06:43.600
that's one not to miss.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.280
Yeah, and then after that,

06:45.280 --> 06:47.080
we're gonna do the shows live from the road.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.520
September 18th.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.760
I think what's lucky about next week is

06:50.760 --> 06:52.840
three of us are gonna be in the studio together, I think.

06:52.840 --> 06:53.680
That's true, right, Wes?

06:53.680 --> 06:54.680
You're gonna make it too?

06:54.680 --> 06:56.040
Mm-hmm, I sure will.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.360
Assuming you get all your stuff packed.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.320
Hey, now.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.280
I think I can make it there in seven days.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.400
I think we can do that.

07:01.400 --> 07:02.600
Ha ha ha.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.160
But that also doesn't happen too often.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.160
You know, only what, like a couple times a year?

07:07.160 --> 07:09.160
So that is a pretty special thing,

07:09.160 --> 07:10.020
or at least it is for me.

07:10.020 --> 07:12.060
So I would say if you wanna catch one,

07:12.060 --> 07:12.900
that's one to catch.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.240
Two to catch, two to catch.

07:14.240 --> 07:15.120
We've been looking forward to this.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.940
The audience has helped make it possible

07:16.940 --> 07:19.340
with the splits to the boost of the show.

07:19.340 --> 07:20.720
Mm, my tank is overfilled.

07:20.720 --> 07:21.560
Brent's gonna make it down,

07:21.560 --> 07:23.360
even though now, of course, we have wildfires,

07:23.360 --> 07:24.600
of course, in the area.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.760
So he'll get a nice kind of a smoked Brent flavor

07:27.760 --> 07:28.600
when he arrives.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.280
We lit off the fireworks to welcome him.

07:30.280 --> 07:31.280
Yeah, that's what we do.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.400
Smokey welcome.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.160
Although we thought he's gonna be on time,

07:34.160 --> 07:36.240
so we let them off a little early,

07:36.240 --> 07:40.360
and so that's all an embarrassing thing, but yeah.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.720
Then, so Brent gets here a couple of days

07:43.720 --> 07:45.320
from when we're recording.

07:45.320 --> 07:46.920
Then we're gonna record some content.

07:46.920 --> 07:47.840
We'll do that double up,

07:47.840 --> 07:51.000
and then we're hitting the road for our west coast tour.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.200
And we have dates at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.880
You never know, things can always change,

07:55.880 --> 07:57.240
so be sure you're following that.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.680
Even if you're already signed up,

07:58.680 --> 08:00.340
just keep an eye on things.

08:00.340 --> 08:04.160
We also have that matrix room, West Coast Crew,

08:04.160 --> 08:06.880
bit.ly slash West Coast Crew.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.460
And we're gonna have some special Linode swag,

08:08.460 --> 08:11.500
because of course, Linode is making this possible.

08:11.500 --> 08:12.960
They're once again partnering with us

08:12.960 --> 08:15.760
to make it doable from a financial standpoint

08:15.760 --> 08:17.920
and from a operational standpoint

08:17.920 --> 08:19.640
and from a logistics standpoint,

08:19.640 --> 08:23.120
to go do these meetups and to go see the community,

08:23.120 --> 08:24.720
to help invest in that community.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.520
It's a real kind of like, you know, high level thing.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.000
And they get it, and they support it,

08:29.000 --> 08:30.480
and we're really grateful.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.600
So we'll have some special swag from them too

08:33.600 --> 08:34.420
that we'll be giving out.

08:34.420 --> 08:36.560
And we'll also have some geocaches

08:36.560 --> 08:38.960
that we'll be stashing along the way.

08:38.960 --> 08:41.080
I'd also like to say if you're planning on joining us

08:41.080 --> 08:42.360
to one of the meetups,

08:42.360 --> 08:44.800
it is pretty important for us to know that you're attending.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.600
So if you can RSVP at the meetup page,

08:46.600 --> 08:49.040
that just helps us suss out some of the numbers

08:49.040 --> 08:53.240
and be able to let the events spaces,

08:53.240 --> 08:55.000
the restaurants know ahead of time

08:55.000 --> 08:56.120
so that we're not surprising them.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.680
So if you can make sure to RSVP, that'd be great.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.760
Linode.com slash unplugged.

09:03.760 --> 09:07.000
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.880
And that's a great way to support the show.

09:08.880 --> 09:09.760
You know, you're getting yourself

09:09.760 --> 09:11.800
some really great experience.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.640
You're getting a hundred bucks to go play with,

09:13.640 --> 09:15.960
I think the best cloud hosting platform out there.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.280
And it's a great way to support the show.

09:17.280 --> 09:18.300
You're supporting the show.

09:18.300 --> 09:19.640
How great is that?

09:19.640 --> 09:23.080
And Linode is really the Linux geeks cloud.

09:23.080 --> 09:24.840
They've got 11 data centers worldwide.

09:24.840 --> 09:26.800
They've been doing this for nearly 19 years.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.960
So they really know what they're doing.

09:28.960 --> 09:33.520
They've had to build the best in class experience

09:33.520 --> 09:36.460
to beat out and compete with everybody else who came along,

09:36.460 --> 09:38.920
not to mention the hyperscalers now,

09:38.920 --> 09:41.960
who seem to have unlimited budgets because let's face it,

09:41.960 --> 09:43.620
their data center operations are funded

09:43.620 --> 09:46.160
by like a completely unrelated business.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.320
So they just had the capacity,

09:48.320 --> 09:50.480
but Linode has had to survive

09:50.480 --> 09:52.360
on the merits of their business.

09:52.360 --> 09:53.920
And their performance is incredible.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.600
They have 11 data centers around the world.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.600
They have a ton of great services too,

09:58.600 --> 10:00.720
stuff you can just one click deploy.

10:00.720 --> 10:01.720
I was just looking recently

10:01.720 --> 10:04.200
because I was setting myself up a new Linode.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.200
And I noticed they just added the Unified Network

10:06.200 --> 10:08.440
application, which is a control panel

10:08.440 --> 10:09.800
that simplifies network management.

10:09.800 --> 10:14.160
If you have Unified Gear, you can throw it up on Linode.

10:14.160 --> 10:16.360
They've always, always been innovating.

10:16.360 --> 10:19.480
Every time I go there, there's like new stuff they've added.

10:19.480 --> 10:20.960
In fact, now they even have a better UI

10:20.960 --> 10:21.800
for displaying it all.

10:21.800 --> 10:22.680
I'm looking at it right now.

10:22.680 --> 10:23.600
I've stopped doing the read,

10:23.600 --> 10:24.760
and now I'm just looking at the different rigs

10:24.760 --> 10:25.600
I want to deploy.

10:25.600 --> 10:29.500
I love Linode, and I think you will too.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.080
The performance, the ease of just getting things up

10:32.080 --> 10:33.000
and running.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.680
And some days I'm feeling like I just want

10:35.680 --> 10:36.600
a push button solution.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.080
Some days I want to build it up from the ground.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.600
And Linode lets me do whichever I prefer.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.480
And if I ever make a mistake, if I ever get stuck,

10:42.480 --> 10:45.360
if I ever need help, they've got 24 seven support.

10:45.360 --> 10:48.840
Because the business, again, has had to actually survive

10:48.840 --> 10:51.160
on the merits of being a really good cloud provider.

10:51.160 --> 10:52.880
And so part of that is having, well,

10:52.880 --> 10:54.600
the best customer support.

10:54.600 --> 10:55.680
So go try them out.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.960
Super fast rigs and networking,

10:57.960 --> 10:59.580
11 data centers around the world,

10:59.580 --> 11:02.880
a Linux culture that runs deep, and 24 seven support.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.400
Plus, it's a great way to support the show.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.960
So go get that hundred bucks.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.660
Linode.com slash unplugged.

11:08.660 --> 11:12.440
One more time, it's Linode.com slash unplugged.

11:12.440 --> 11:17.440
We got some baller boosts, the big supporters

11:17.840 --> 11:18.680
for the show this week.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.040
And just a reminder, we have a link in the show notes

11:21.040 --> 11:24.160
to an open issue to help us source a new baller boost

11:24.160 --> 11:26.400
and sound bite, I should say.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.440
And there's some really good ones in there.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.840
So do keep them coming.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.640
I think what we have three or four people,

11:31.640 --> 11:32.800
it's mostly Brent.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.480
Yeah, Brent laid the seeds here and did a good job.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.600
I figured I would like, you know, warm things up

11:37.600 --> 11:40.160
and leave a sort of template for those to follow.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.520
And I've been pretty happy with the extra submissions.

11:42.520 --> 11:44.880
So I think keep them rolling in.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.260
I'd like to see more people do it though,

11:46.260 --> 11:49.040
because right now this is feeling like one of those issues

11:49.040 --> 11:51.220
where like I bring up, hey, what color should this thing be?

11:51.220 --> 11:52.760
And everybody has an opinion on the color,

11:52.760 --> 11:54.440
but then I ask, okay, who's gonna write the code

11:54.440 --> 11:55.680
to set that to be that color?

11:55.680 --> 11:57.000
And then like, nobody steps up.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.300
It's like, oh, so nobody really cares.

11:59.300 --> 12:00.140
I do.

12:00.140 --> 12:01.560
They have an opinion until the work comes to,

12:01.560 --> 12:02.620
yeah, right, I know you do.

12:02.620 --> 12:04.880
Yeah, so we'll have a link in the show notes

12:04.880 --> 12:05.920
and we'll get a new baller boost.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.540
But in the meantime, I do wanna thank Jade Lion

12:08.540 --> 12:13.500
for their 111,111 SATs.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.200
They boosted in for my long podcasting 2.0 rant support

12:17.200 --> 12:18.040
last week.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.060
Thank you very much for that, Jade.

12:20.060 --> 12:21.120
And I wanted to say, you know,

12:21.120 --> 12:23.520
something interesting happened in the last week.

12:24.840 --> 12:28.600
Fountain has made a new discovery mechanism.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.320
They've built a new discovery mechanism

12:30.320 --> 12:33.560
into the Fountain podcast player.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.880
And one of the tabs when you're looking for podcasts

12:35.880 --> 12:40.880
to find now is some of the most boosted shows on Fountain.

12:41.880 --> 12:44.680
They call it hot on Fountain in there.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.720
And this exposes shows that are getting some big boosts.

12:47.720 --> 12:50.160
And as a result, we've had thousands of people

12:50.160 --> 12:51.800
find the show in the last week.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.200
What people are doing is these boosts act as signal.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.960
When people see a show that gets boosted a lot,

12:55.960 --> 12:58.320
it's a good indication there's high quality there.

12:58.320 --> 13:02.400
It's better than any kind of algorithm from Google.

13:02.400 --> 13:06.640
It's real people sending real value to that podcaster.

13:06.640 --> 13:07.560
It's a real signal.

13:07.560 --> 13:10.040
So Fountain is now exposing that

13:10.040 --> 13:11.600
and showing you which ones are getting the boosts.

13:11.600 --> 13:14.920
And what's incredible now is not only can you support

13:14.920 --> 13:17.440
the show by boosting and get a message onto the show,

13:17.440 --> 13:19.560
but you can also make it possible for other people

13:19.560 --> 13:22.100
to discover the show by putting this on these lists.

13:22.100 --> 13:25.800
So when we get a boost from Jade, that's 111,000 SATs,

13:26.680 --> 13:27.800
that puts us up there on that list.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.440
That makes a difference to the show,

13:29.440 --> 13:31.300
not just in a monetary sense,

13:31.300 --> 13:33.920
but in a way that helps other people find the show.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.640
So thank you very much for that.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.960
And Fountain, keep on rocking it.

13:36.960 --> 13:39.020
Check out the Hot on Fountain

13:39.020 --> 13:40.560
and their new lightning podcast section,

13:40.560 --> 13:43.620
helping really spread value for value

13:43.620 --> 13:47.620
and podcasting 2.0 and decentralized podcast financing.

13:47.620 --> 13:48.680
You know, Chris, I would imagine

13:48.680 --> 13:51.200
that's an unintended consequence.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.800
Like that's not something we could have really predicted

13:53.800 --> 13:56.680
when we kind of kicked all this off in January.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.940
And I totally think it makes sense.

13:58.940 --> 14:01.440
I hadn't thought about it, but it absolutely makes sense

14:01.440 --> 14:04.040
is I've discovered shows by,

14:04.040 --> 14:05.720
so one of the big things in Fountain,

14:05.720 --> 14:07.680
not to go on and on about it,

14:07.680 --> 14:09.800
because I think Podverse is really great too.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.400
But one of the great things in Fountain

14:11.400 --> 14:13.200
is that they have this clips section

14:13.200 --> 14:14.300
that is really well done.

14:14.300 --> 14:18.520
And I have added three weekly listens now,

14:18.520 --> 14:20.840
three weekly listens to my podcast collection

14:20.840 --> 14:22.960
through this clips mechanism on here.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.800
And boy, isn't that something like,

14:24.800 --> 14:26.760
how did this not get thought of earlier?

14:26.760 --> 14:29.360
It's a perfect thing for highlighting and sharing podcasts.

14:29.360 --> 14:30.200
It totally is.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.400
Because how often are you listening to one,

14:31.400 --> 14:32.600
you're like, that was a great little thing.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.500
They summarized X or they explained that well.

14:34.500 --> 14:35.640
I'd love to share that with someone

14:35.640 --> 14:37.880
who I might not be able to convince offhand

14:37.880 --> 14:39.940
to listen to the whole darn podcast.

14:39.940 --> 14:40.800
Or me.

14:40.800 --> 14:41.640
Like, I don't know if I want to listen

14:41.640 --> 14:43.000
to the whole darn podcast,

14:43.000 --> 14:44.360
but a lot of times people will clip

14:44.360 --> 14:46.040
some of the best moments in the show.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.300
And I'm like, that was good.

14:47.300 --> 14:48.900
And I go and I subscribe.

14:48.900 --> 14:50.160
And then the other thing that's in here

14:50.160 --> 14:52.560
is the individual clips can get boosts.

14:52.560 --> 14:55.400
So you can like a clip with 10 sats.

14:55.400 --> 14:58.800
And so then you can start looking at the most boosted clips.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.840
And so there's a lot of ways you can sort by it.

15:00.840 --> 15:03.080
And it's a signal that works.

15:03.080 --> 15:04.440
I think it's fascinating.

15:04.440 --> 15:07.560
It's better than I think than Google putting their hands

15:07.560 --> 15:09.340
on that algorithm and promoting things

15:09.340 --> 15:12.340
like NBC News as a podcast.

15:12.340 --> 15:13.180
Anyways, moving on.

15:13.180 --> 15:16.040
John A boosted in with 30,000 sats.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.440
We asked how far behind folks are.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.140
He says, wait, you mean people aren't listening

15:20.140 --> 15:22.640
and boosting the moment a new episode releases?

15:22.640 --> 15:24.800
30,000 sats from John A.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.440
And here's what's incredible about that.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.360
John A's first boost was last week.

15:30.360 --> 15:33.160
Second week, he's now a baller booster.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.120
So thank you, John, for the support.

15:35.120 --> 15:35.960
That is really great.

15:35.960 --> 15:40.760
And then, of course, a frequent baller booster

15:40.760 --> 15:42.240
comes into the show.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.000
And that is, of course, Optimus Gray

15:44.000 --> 15:48.400
coming in with a row of McDucks, 22,222 sats.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.040
Thank you kindly.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.400
He's on board with the Golden Dragon as the LUP mascot.

15:53.400 --> 15:57.120
So we have second approval from an audience member.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.400
I think that means it's official.

15:58.400 --> 15:59.920
Yes, you have the deal right there.

15:59.920 --> 16:03.560
But Golden Dragon needs to make sure he gets a hype song.

16:03.560 --> 16:04.680
He needs a hype song.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.480
So I think that's understandable.

16:06.480 --> 16:08.560
Maybe he gets a licensed hype song.

16:08.560 --> 16:11.160
Maybe something that goes up on the soundboard for when

16:11.160 --> 16:12.400
he boosts in, something like that.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.240
So we'll have to work that out.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.800
But I think it's a great suggestion.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.040
Thank you, Optimus.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.280
And thank you for the support.

16:17.280 --> 16:20.080
If you would like to be a baller and boost into the show

16:20.080 --> 16:22.360
and get your message read in this section,

16:22.360 --> 16:24.520
please send us a baller boost with a new podcast app

16:24.520 --> 16:27.200
at newpodcastapps.com.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.680
And we want to transition into something

16:29.680 --> 16:31.360
that is hard to talk about on the show,

16:31.360 --> 16:34.160
because it often sounds like we're being just critical.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.400
And we're just kind of complaining about something.

16:36.400 --> 16:37.760
But that is not the case.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.440
We love this stuff, right?

16:39.440 --> 16:40.520
But we're invested in it.

16:40.520 --> 16:42.040
And we want to make sure that it's

16:42.040 --> 16:43.940
meeting the needs of users, that it's growing,

16:43.940 --> 16:46.400
that it's adapting for the future, all of those things

16:46.400 --> 16:49.000
that the projects we use are healthy.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.280
If you don't talk about problems,

16:51.280 --> 16:52.320
how can that be the case?

16:52.320 --> 16:54.240
And that's the lens in which we are going

16:54.240 --> 16:56.120
to look at today's segment.

16:56.120 --> 16:58.360
Well, today's segment has been on my mind for, I think,

16:58.360 --> 17:02.160
about a year and a half, maybe more.

17:02.160 --> 17:05.000
And again, it comes from an absolute place of love.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.600
And today, we're talking about some struggles with plasma,

17:08.600 --> 17:10.640
KD's plasma.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.520
I've been a plasma user for, I think,

17:13.520 --> 17:16.480
it's something like five years now.

17:16.480 --> 17:20.400
First started on Anturgos and moved on to Kubuntu.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.440
And gentlemen, I mean, there's some in the studio as well,

17:23.440 --> 17:24.120
some plasma.

17:24.120 --> 17:26.520
And where does it fit in your lives?

17:26.520 --> 17:28.520
Oh, yeah, we use it here in production.

17:28.520 --> 17:32.160
I use it for my main recording OS.

17:32.160 --> 17:34.440
I don't always use it as my sit-on-the-couch OS,

17:34.440 --> 17:35.720
but I definitely put it in places

17:35.720 --> 17:36.920
where I care if it breaks.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.400
Yeah, I think that laptop you're using there is probably

17:38.400 --> 17:40.080
I'm running plasma as we're doing the show right now.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.520
This machine right here is plasma

17:41.520 --> 17:42.360
that I'm sitting in front of.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.560
And then, of course, our OBS machine is plasma.

17:44.560 --> 17:48.400
It's been a really good production work desktop.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.520
Yeah, so clearly lots of plasma love going around here.

17:51.520 --> 17:52.720
And for good reason.

17:52.720 --> 17:55.400
I think it's a desktop environment that

17:55.400 --> 17:56.960
has a ton of features that we love.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.040
It's kind of extensible.

17:59.040 --> 18:01.520
You can modify it to your own needs.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.920
But what I've noticed, and I haven't quite

18:03.920 --> 18:07.120
been able to put my finger on it until just about this last week

18:07.120 --> 18:10.760
or so, what I've noticed for this last year and a half

18:10.760 --> 18:17.000
is some changes or maybe some rough edges

18:17.000 --> 18:22.320
that I've noticed in Kubuntu at first, especially around 2204.

18:22.320 --> 18:25.600
But also, that caused me to go looking elsewhere

18:25.600 --> 18:28.120
for some great plasma integrations.

18:28.120 --> 18:32.040
And I got to say, it's been a little rough road for me.

18:32.040 --> 18:37.960
So I wanted to explore, I think, the history of Kubuntu

18:37.960 --> 18:41.040
and the history of other spins, like Fedora's spin,

18:41.040 --> 18:47.480
and plasma, where it's come from the mid-2000s to now.

18:47.480 --> 18:50.000
And I think there's been some major changes

18:50.000 --> 18:53.880
in how it's been integrated in various distributions.

18:53.880 --> 18:57.800
And we start to ask some big questions like, well, why?

18:57.800 --> 19:00.560
Where's it headed, I think, is really what I want to know.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.880
Because I want it to stick around and be the best it can

19:02.880 --> 19:03.360
be.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.160
So that's an interesting question.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.000
If I think back into the past, I can definitely,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.360
some distributions really stand out.

19:10.360 --> 19:14.440
Soos had a really strong KDE desktop experience.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.440
I seem to recall Mandrake and Mandriva

19:16.440 --> 19:19.360
having a pretty good plasma desktop or KDE desktop

19:19.360 --> 19:21.000
experience at the time.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.560
So I'm curious when you say you've seen a shift over time.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.720
Maybe let's start there.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.040
What do you mean specifically?

19:27.040 --> 19:28.220
Well, I did a little research.

19:28.220 --> 19:31.800
And back in 2007, which if some of you were heavy Linux users,

19:31.800 --> 19:32.720
you may remember this.

19:32.720 --> 19:37.040
But it seems that for the most important distributions,

19:37.040 --> 19:41.200
Red Hat and Fedora had GNOME, Debian, Ubuntu also.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.960
But OpenSUSE, like you said, had KDE as a default desktop.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.120
Mandriva certainly did.

19:46.120 --> 19:48.480
PC Linux OS as well.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.040
And Slackware and Mepis as well.

19:51.040 --> 19:56.480
So that is round five, five or so for KDE

19:56.480 --> 20:00.600
as the top contenders with three or so going to GNOME.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.800
And these days, that's not quite the case.

20:03.800 --> 20:09.120
Some distributions have gone to desktop agnostic,

20:09.120 --> 20:10.520
I think I'll call it.

20:10.520 --> 20:15.080
So now you see OpenSUSE just kind of offering KDE or GNOME

20:15.080 --> 20:17.280
or Xfce right in the installer, which is actually

20:17.280 --> 20:19.160
a really nice way to do it.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.540
But you have some popular distributions like Mint,

20:21.540 --> 20:24.280
for instance, that doesn't even offer, well,

20:24.280 --> 20:25.600
either GNOME or KDE.

20:25.600 --> 20:29.600
They've got Cinnamon, Mate, or Xfce as their sort of choices.

20:29.600 --> 20:35.160
But then Ubuntu and Debian has the default.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.080
Well, I think Ubuntu is a special case.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.360
Debian offers choices, but sort of pre-selects a default

20:40.360 --> 20:42.880
as GNOME for you.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.480
But in the corporate arena these days,

20:46.480 --> 20:50.560
I think GNOME is really the contender.

20:50.560 --> 20:53.120
Red Hat, RHEL, CentOS, they've all

20:53.120 --> 20:56.040
had GNOME as sort of the main thrust, and that makes sense.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.520
I mean, they put a lot of work into that development, right?

20:58.520 --> 21:02.400
They're one of the main funders of development, would you say?

21:02.400 --> 21:05.040
There was a time where Unity had made some serious inroads

21:05.040 --> 21:09.120
there, but after Canonical chose to switch back to GNOME,

21:09.120 --> 21:10.840
I think it's really taken the day.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.520
And even when Unity was strong there,

21:12.520 --> 21:14.360
GTK was still kind of the king.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.240
Exactly, yeah.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.040
That's the underlying theme, is GTK has

21:17.040 --> 21:18.480
done really well in that space.

21:18.480 --> 21:21.840
Honestly, I know a few folks who use Linux at work.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.640
I bet they don't even know Plasma exists.

21:23.640 --> 21:25.640
Yeah, and of course, of course, we're

21:25.640 --> 21:28.520
talking a slice of the market.

21:28.520 --> 21:30.800
Obviously, Qt is extremely successful.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.400
It's huge in the enterprise.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.520
We're talking about desktop here.

21:34.520 --> 21:39.040
Yeah, desktop specifically, I think, is pretty accurate.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.480
I think my question then that we're trying to answer

21:41.480 --> 21:45.600
is, are the spins and the flavors just kind

21:45.600 --> 21:48.320
of second-rate citizens, and are they getting enough attention?

21:48.320 --> 21:51.200
Because my sort of anecdotal experience

21:51.200 --> 21:55.800
in the last several weeks, even months, of trying

21:55.800 --> 21:59.240
to suss out this space, trying Neon, for instance,

21:59.240 --> 22:00.680
which is promising.

22:00.680 --> 22:04.480
It offers the latest Plasma on top of really stable Ubuntu

22:04.480 --> 22:07.440
base, which is kind of a nice combination.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.960
So trying that when I was at Alex's place

22:09.960 --> 22:14.000
for the last few months, trying Fedora's spin of KDE

22:14.000 --> 22:15.880
has been an interesting journey.

22:15.880 --> 22:21.760
And then just kind of retesting my own assumptions

22:21.760 --> 22:28.480
about what 2204 might offer me, I sort of come

22:28.480 --> 22:32.400
into some struggles, actually, which I don't love.

22:32.400 --> 22:35.520
And I haven't heard that much from either of you.

22:35.520 --> 22:39.360
Have you tried sort of, I think, Chris, you have Neon in front

22:39.360 --> 22:40.680
of you, is that correct?

22:40.680 --> 22:41.600
Yeah, you got it.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.000
You know, when I'm listening, what I'm hearing

22:44.000 --> 22:48.480
is you kind of started going from tried and true

22:48.480 --> 22:56.360
stable LTS Plasma to more like modern rolling current Plasma.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.080
And I wonder if what you're seeing

22:58.080 --> 23:02.480
is the difference between kind of these milestone releases.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.760
Carefully gated, kind of curated, right?

23:04.760 --> 23:06.640
Had some time to get that level of polish

23:06.640 --> 23:08.720
and those things ironed out before moving on.

23:08.720 --> 23:12.080
Yeah, although I do run Neon, and I don't really

23:12.080 --> 23:14.400
run into any particular problems,

23:14.400 --> 23:17.160
although my NVIDIA driver is broken at the moment.

23:17.160 --> 23:18.520
So those things do happen.

23:18.520 --> 23:20.800
I feel like my Neon experiences, I

23:20.800 --> 23:23.400
don't know if I'd call them problems, but things kind of

23:23.400 --> 23:24.760
change and go back, right?

23:24.760 --> 23:26.960
Or maybe there's a thing where you notice something crashes

23:26.960 --> 23:29.000
a little bit for a week, but then by the time you've updated

23:29.000 --> 23:30.360
again, it's gone.

23:30.360 --> 23:33.200
So those things show up, but they're not always static.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.200
Yeah, and none of them have been like deal breakers yet.

23:36.200 --> 23:36.840
There's that.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.560
They're more like curiosities, like, oh, that's different,

23:39.560 --> 23:40.040
right?

23:40.040 --> 23:42.200
Right, but I can still get to what I need to get to,

23:42.200 --> 23:45.000
so I'll continue on, and then I'll update in a couple of days.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.760
You also touched on something there, Brent,

23:46.760 --> 23:50.360
that I think could almost be a show topic on its own,

23:50.360 --> 23:55.520
and that is do these spins get the same level of attention

23:55.520 --> 23:58.560
that the main like distro version?

23:58.560 --> 23:59.960
You have Ubuntu proper, right?

23:59.960 --> 24:03.280
You've got Fedora workstation, and then you've got Kubuntu,

24:03.280 --> 24:06.120
and you've got the Fedora KDE spin.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.000
And just like we know the answer.

24:08.000 --> 24:12.240
We know that those spins have less users and less developers,

24:12.240 --> 24:19.200
and KDE is now often relegated to spin status or flavor status.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.280
And so I think that means it's often not

24:21.280 --> 24:25.880
getting a complete like all of distro implementation focus.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.400
And that's not to take anything away

24:27.400 --> 24:30.200
from the Kubuntu team or any of the other distro

24:30.200 --> 24:33.760
makers who are making the plasma version of that distro,

24:33.760 --> 24:35.560
but I do think there might be something

24:35.560 --> 24:41.400
to your underlying observation in that over time,

24:41.400 --> 24:43.720
the main spin of all of these distros

24:43.720 --> 24:46.880
really is, for the most part, their GNOME spin,

24:46.880 --> 24:48.840
with some exceptions.

24:48.840 --> 24:52.760
And maybe that has altered the implementation

24:52.760 --> 24:54.400
to be less perfect.

24:54.400 --> 24:56.200
I don't know, though.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.600
I really don't know.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.920
I mean, it sort of necessarily does, right?

24:59.920 --> 25:02.840
I mean, KDE feels a little bit now

25:02.840 --> 25:06.800
like it's mainly a community project from what

25:06.800 --> 25:08.280
I've been able to research.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.800
And I'm happy to be wrong about that if someone

25:10.800 --> 25:12.680
has some inside information.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.800
I think they proudly are a community project.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.200
I think that's, you know.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.400
Oh, oh, oh, I don't mean to take away from that.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.040
I think as a community project, it

25:21.040 --> 25:24.240
does some amazing, amazing, amazing things.

25:24.240 --> 25:29.360
But I think because it's not the default of some

25:29.360 --> 25:34.080
of these larger enterprise entities,

25:34.080 --> 25:37.680
it maybe doesn't always get maybe the funding

25:37.680 --> 25:41.640
for the kind of work that we would all love to see it get,

25:41.640 --> 25:45.080
even though it's still a super impressive piece of software.

25:45.080 --> 25:50.040
I think I come at this from the most loving place possible,

25:50.040 --> 25:54.480
which is like, I want this thing to keep being as successful as

25:54.480 --> 25:55.200
it has been.

25:55.200 --> 25:58.960
And I hope that my observations are only

25:58.960 --> 26:00.760
a shift in my own perspective.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.720
You mentioned very astutely that maybe I'm just

26:03.720 --> 26:06.400
looking at sort of more leading edge KDE.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.360
And so I'm finding, of course, as I do,

26:08.360 --> 26:10.900
finding more rough edges in the software.

26:10.900 --> 26:14.160
I hope that's the case, is that I'm the one who has changed.

26:14.160 --> 26:17.480
And KDE is not at all changing and just continuing

26:17.480 --> 26:18.840
to do its wonderful thing.

26:18.840 --> 26:20.920
I hope that's the answer because that

26:20.920 --> 26:21.960
would make me quite happy.

26:21.960 --> 26:25.960
But I just have some worries, I guess is the way to put it.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.920
You know, it's hard to say.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.040
I'd like to get into some of the specifics of what you run into.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.160
Maybe we can kick that around a little bit.

26:33.160 --> 26:36.200
For myself, I have definitely struggled

26:36.200 --> 26:40.440
with plasma implementations when I have different monitors,

26:40.440 --> 26:43.040
different resolutions, and different refresh rates.

26:43.040 --> 26:44.840
And I struggle with that with GNOME as well.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.020
It's just an area where, for me, I'm always

26:47.020 --> 26:48.920
hitting bugs in Linux with.

26:48.920 --> 26:51.040
And I wish that experience was better.

26:51.040 --> 26:56.480
But on the whole, I feel like things are collectively just

26:56.480 --> 26:58.280
getting better overall.

26:58.280 --> 26:59.600
Then there's all these edge cases,

26:59.600 --> 27:01.440
like, well, are you using an NVIDIA card?

27:01.440 --> 27:02.640
Are you on Wayland?

27:02.640 --> 27:03.760
Are you on X11?

27:03.760 --> 27:05.840
Are you on an Intel machine or an AMD machine?

27:05.840 --> 27:07.360
And then things get a little weird.

27:07.360 --> 27:10.840
But I want to know specifically what problems you had.

27:10.840 --> 27:15.080
Yeah, and I think my data isn't necessarily empirical.

27:15.080 --> 27:18.320
And I should have taken a more scientific approach.

27:18.320 --> 27:22.080
However, we've had discussions back and forth

27:22.080 --> 27:24.840
for a few months now about the kinds of problems

27:24.840 --> 27:25.720
I've run into.

27:25.720 --> 27:28.400
And I think some of this was pretty clear

27:28.400 --> 27:29.880
when I was at Alex's place.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.480
He has some pretty new hardware.

27:31.480 --> 27:33.480
I think it was a 3080 or something

27:33.480 --> 27:37.560
he's running over there that had some video issues, especially

27:37.560 --> 27:38.160
with Wayland.

27:38.160 --> 27:40.640
It ended up being nearly unusable.

27:40.640 --> 27:43.440
And I had to switch X11, still had some issues there.

27:43.440 --> 27:46.240
So I think that is partly explained

27:46.240 --> 27:47.880
by some hardware, for sure.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.880
And like you mentioned, I was constantly

27:49.880 --> 27:51.040
having monitor issues.

27:51.040 --> 27:54.400
He has multiple relatively state-of-the-art monitors

27:54.400 --> 27:58.040
and relatively state-of-the-art GPUs as well.

27:58.040 --> 28:02.880
And so I can't point the finger only

28:02.880 --> 28:06.440
at the display manager or anything like that.

28:06.440 --> 28:09.600
I think hardware still does play a huge factor there.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.760
So it's not fair to point the finger only

28:11.760 --> 28:14.000
at one of the things in the pipeline here.

28:14.000 --> 28:18.160
So kudos to you for checking me on that.

28:18.160 --> 28:18.840
Well, no, no.

28:18.840 --> 28:22.520
I mean, it's all like the end user experience, right?

28:22.520 --> 28:24.400
I mean, everyone runs into these problems.

28:24.400 --> 28:27.640
So video monitor issues, anything in particular?

28:27.640 --> 28:29.560
Two out of three times, it would work fine.

28:29.560 --> 28:32.000
The third time, it would wake from sleep, for instance.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.240
One of the monitors would just never turn on.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.920
So I'd have to put it back to sleep

28:35.920 --> 28:38.440
and then hope for the next two out of three.

28:38.440 --> 28:40.560
That was a thing that was occurring specifically

28:40.560 --> 28:43.280
on Alex's system over at his office,

28:43.280 --> 28:45.640
where I would adjust the chair quite frequently.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.440
So that was a slightly annoying one.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.640
But you know what is interesting,

28:50.640 --> 28:53.440
which is sort of moving away from the hardware a little bit

28:53.440 --> 28:56.480
and more some of the Plasma-specific features,

28:56.480 --> 28:58.440
something I got into before that trip,

28:58.440 --> 29:02.600
so before headed to Alex's, here on my local computers

29:02.600 --> 29:04.800
that I've been running Kubuntu on for quite a while

29:04.800 --> 29:09.520
is Plasma has this wonderful concept

29:09.520 --> 29:13.280
of something called activities, which is almost like,

29:13.280 --> 29:16.400
but don't call it this, it's almost like virtual desktops.

29:16.400 --> 29:19.120
But it just is a bit more powerful and more sort

29:19.120 --> 29:23.040
of context-specific, I think it's worth reading into

29:23.040 --> 29:24.080
because it's a great idea.

29:24.080 --> 29:29.080
But I tried it for a few weeks and found a few bugs in it

29:29.880 --> 29:32.560
to the point where it was a little clumsy to use.

29:32.560 --> 29:34.680
And I thought, okay, well, I'm gonna try neon

29:34.680 --> 29:37.280
at Alex's place and we'll try it there again.

29:37.280 --> 29:39.760
And it was even more problematic in the sense

29:39.760 --> 29:42.960
that it's almost like it was this great feature

29:42.960 --> 29:46.440
that got implemented years and years ago that worked great.

29:46.440 --> 29:48.720
But then it just hasn't, it's one of those features

29:48.720 --> 29:50.680
that's a little hidden and not everybody uses it.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.760
And so I feel like maybe there's a little bit

29:52.760 --> 29:53.760
of entropy there.

29:54.640 --> 29:57.680
And I think that adds to my like, oh, well,

29:57.680 --> 30:01.000
what, how can we fix this?

30:01.000 --> 30:04.680
And I think submitting bugs is certainly a way to do that.

30:04.680 --> 30:08.560
And yep, I can do that and yep, I have done that.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.440
We'll come up with a list in a little bit.

30:10.440 --> 30:13.880
But I admittedly haven't submitted bugs

30:13.880 --> 30:15.680
for every single issue that I ran into

30:15.680 --> 30:18.800
because sometimes it was like two, three, four things piling

30:18.800 --> 30:21.880
on top of each other in the span of trying to get work done

30:21.880 --> 30:22.960
in an hour sort of thing.

30:22.960 --> 30:27.960
So it started getting a little worrisome, I suppose.

30:29.480 --> 30:31.760
But in the studio, Chris, it sounds like you don't run

30:31.760 --> 30:32.600
into any of this.

30:32.600 --> 30:33.600
So I don't know, is it just me?

30:33.600 --> 30:34.920
This'll derail a little bit perhaps,

30:34.920 --> 30:38.000
but I wanted to give voice, Casey in our chat room

30:38.000 --> 30:41.400
had a thought that I'd kind of wondered a little bit as well.

30:41.400 --> 30:44.080
He's wondering how much of some of this might be Brent

30:44.080 --> 30:47.640
becoming more technically knowledgeable and experienced.

30:47.640 --> 30:50.000
The more you sort of learn what's going on under the covers,

30:50.000 --> 30:51.520
the more you take deeper looks at things,

30:51.520 --> 30:53.160
the more cracks you discover.

30:53.160 --> 30:54.960
And he also here calls out that it's not,

30:54.960 --> 30:56.200
this is mostly just saying,

30:56.200 --> 30:59.200
Brent, you've learned a lot and we all see it.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.600
Oh, thanks.

31:01.720 --> 31:03.560
And I think that's a possibility,

31:03.560 --> 31:06.760
like I'm evolving and that's fine, that's fine.

31:06.760 --> 31:10.640
I wonder, and I didn't want this to be my answer,

31:10.640 --> 31:14.040
but I can't help but feel like maybe this is part of it.

31:15.760 --> 31:20.320
Is those of us who have been schlepping for Linux

31:20.320 --> 31:24.560
for a really long time are maybe willing

31:24.560 --> 31:27.360
to forgive a lot of things.

31:27.360 --> 31:30.320
And like also when things break,

31:30.320 --> 31:34.080
I tend to just move forward and like work around it.

31:34.080 --> 31:36.720
Like I don't stop and I barely even acknowledge the breakage

31:36.720 --> 31:39.520
other than maybe like, ah, this goddamn thing, ah, shit.

31:39.520 --> 31:41.560
And then I'll just move right on.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.640
And it's not, what am I trying to say?

31:43.640 --> 31:44.480
You know what I'm trying to say, Wes?

31:44.480 --> 31:46.760
It's like this mentality of-

31:46.760 --> 31:48.880
I think we're calloused in a way.

31:48.880 --> 31:49.720
Yeah.

31:49.720 --> 31:50.560
Like we're just, we're used to that thing.

31:50.560 --> 31:51.960
We know we're getting this stuff for free.

31:51.960 --> 31:54.120
We don't expect, there's not that,

31:54.120 --> 31:55.440
I mean, some people maybe there is,

31:55.440 --> 31:57.720
but you might get upset about these things,

31:57.720 --> 32:00.120
especially if you've paid an exorbitant amount for software,

32:00.120 --> 32:03.480
but when you just got it gratis and you appreciate how much

32:03.480 --> 32:05.240
and you kind of know what's happening on the backend,

32:05.240 --> 32:06.800
I think, yeah, I'm fairly willing,

32:06.800 --> 32:09.280
if it's not a totally derailing issue,

32:09.280 --> 32:11.240
I'm fairly willing to just say like,

32:11.240 --> 32:13.040
all right, well, I appreciate that.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.240
I could have made that mistake,

32:14.240 --> 32:15.840
or maybe you're trying to improve this,

32:15.840 --> 32:17.160
but it's no longer working for me.

32:17.160 --> 32:20.460
Or it's like you've seen how the sausage is made

32:20.460 --> 32:23.520
so many times that you know how long of a shot it is

32:23.520 --> 32:24.800
that some of these fringe issues

32:24.800 --> 32:25.960
are ever gonna get taken care of.

32:25.960 --> 32:27.920
Like that's not really gonna get fixed

32:27.920 --> 32:29.820
until the entire stack is replaced.

32:29.820 --> 32:31.160
And how often some of the stuff

32:31.160 --> 32:32.440
that looks shallow on the surface

32:32.440 --> 32:33.880
is actually due to like very deep,

32:33.880 --> 32:36.240
complicated interactions between different subsystems.

32:36.240 --> 32:38.960
And you're like, oh, I thought that was just a simple toggle.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.320
And it's like, well, no, these things have long histories

32:41.320 --> 32:42.760
and we gotta maintain compatibility

32:42.760 --> 32:45.140
and it's gonna take mountains of work to fix that.

32:45.140 --> 32:48.220
And sometimes, and I don't like this answer

32:48.220 --> 32:49.480
because I think you always,

32:49.480 --> 32:51.280
everything has to be evaluated on its own.

32:51.280 --> 32:52.720
But sometimes I think to myself,

32:52.720 --> 32:54.560
some of these compromises,

32:54.560 --> 32:56.640
like when I wake my machine up upstairs

32:56.640 --> 32:58.880
and my monitor's just totally all screwed up

32:58.880 --> 33:01.720
and one of them is flickering like it's having a seizure

33:01.720 --> 33:04.260
and the other one, all my windows are rotated

33:04.260 --> 33:06.220
and completely messed up in the wrong spot.

33:06.220 --> 33:09.340
And I do get frustrated and I think,

33:10.800 --> 33:13.440
it's still a better option than running Windows.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.800
I still trust this system more

33:15.800 --> 33:18.200
than I'll ever trust Windows or the Mac.

33:18.200 --> 33:21.020
And I don't deal with some of the other things

33:21.020 --> 33:23.660
on these proprietary systems that drive me crazy.

33:23.660 --> 33:28.660
Like I might get a 99% accuracy hit on the Mac

33:29.480 --> 33:31.300
when I wake it up with multiple monitors

33:31.300 --> 33:33.040
and where all the screens are and everything like that.

33:33.040 --> 33:36.300
It might be like 98, 99% accurate almost every time.

33:37.360 --> 33:41.440
But man, is it a nightmare to deal with Mac OS updates.

33:41.440 --> 33:46.080
And does it just waste an entire two hours sometimes

33:46.080 --> 33:49.220
for some unconceivable reason doing some update

33:49.220 --> 33:51.760
that I don't even know what it's actually doing.

33:51.760 --> 33:54.400
And what a hot mess are all the different

33:54.400 --> 33:56.120
self-implemented updaters on Mac OS

33:56.120 --> 33:59.180
and all these little things about the OS

33:59.180 --> 34:02.560
that I never have to deal with on a Linux box.

34:02.560 --> 34:05.720
And it's stuff that slows me down and takes my time.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.500
It's like, I went on a website this morning.

34:07.500 --> 34:10.200
I was looking up some of the smoke conditions around here

34:10.200 --> 34:15.020
and I got this big pop-up that says we value your time.

34:15.020 --> 34:16.720
And they had all these questions for me.

34:16.720 --> 34:19.280
And I'm like, you lying bastard.

34:19.280 --> 34:22.240
If you valued my time, you wouldn't be putting this pop-up

34:22.240 --> 34:24.520
in front of my face and stopping me, right?

34:24.520 --> 34:25.840
That's Windows.

34:25.840 --> 34:28.520
Windows is like that, we value your time.

34:28.520 --> 34:31.880
Your answer, your call will be answered in 15 minutes.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.200
Like that's Windows, right?

34:33.200 --> 34:36.120
Where Linux is like there's no call waiting,

34:36.120 --> 34:39.360
there's no hold, you just get on, you get your answer,

34:39.360 --> 34:40.480
you get the job done.

34:40.480 --> 34:44.760
And so I weigh those things higher

34:44.760 --> 34:47.080
than I weigh the niggling issues

34:47.080 --> 34:49.080
that I run into from time to time.

34:49.080 --> 34:52.760
And generally, they're never issues

34:52.760 --> 34:55.280
that prevent me from working, right?

34:55.280 --> 34:57.080
Whereas like the deal with Mac OS updates

34:57.080 --> 34:59.820
and its silly long update process,

34:59.820 --> 35:01.080
that'll stop you from working.

35:01.080 --> 35:03.280
You can't work while the machine's doing that.

35:03.280 --> 35:05.160
Where I can choose a Linux distro

35:05.160 --> 35:08.040
that does updates very quick and very efficiently.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.920
And there's also so many more knobs as well as insight,

35:10.920 --> 35:13.400
like I have a lot more faith that there will be

35:13.400 --> 35:16.000
like a bug report that I'll be able to see at least

35:16.000 --> 35:17.720
that can document or I can contribute

35:17.720 --> 35:19.280
to acknowledge this issue.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.760
You can go look at the source code

35:20.760 --> 35:24.920
and to some extent I feel kind of like a guest in a hotel

35:24.920 --> 35:26.360
on some of those other desktops.

35:26.360 --> 35:29.880
I expect to be catered to because I don't have any options.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.880
Whereas with Linux, it's like your own tool,

35:31.880 --> 35:34.560
it's your own house and sometimes you're pretty upset

35:34.560 --> 35:37.280
because well, you really didn't paint that wall very well

35:37.280 --> 35:38.120
or whatever.

35:38.120 --> 35:38.960
You didn't finish that over there.

35:38.960 --> 35:39.780
You know?

35:39.780 --> 35:42.000
But you can then customize it if you need to.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.400
Or like you could compile your own build to Plasma

35:44.400 --> 35:45.440
if you really wanted to.

35:45.440 --> 35:47.160
I don't think you do, but you could, right?

35:47.160 --> 35:48.240
Or you could just stop updating.

35:48.240 --> 35:50.400
You could stick to a stable branch if you wanted to.

35:50.400 --> 35:51.980
I think we, I don't know, you guys may know,

35:51.980 --> 35:55.340
but I used to work with a PHP developer who did just that.

35:55.340 --> 35:58.300
He would get like whatever the previous LTS was

35:58.300 --> 36:01.000
and he would only use that and only use the software

36:01.000 --> 36:03.920
from that repo and he refused to use anything newer

36:03.920 --> 36:05.400
because of the problems you're having.

36:05.400 --> 36:08.100
And Brent, that was almost a decade ago.

36:08.100 --> 36:11.200
It was like, it's always kind of been the case.

36:11.200 --> 36:13.740
And I think that's where the distros still play a role.

36:13.740 --> 36:17.440
And you've just happened to choose a desktop environment

36:17.440 --> 36:19.720
that maybe some of the major distros aren't focusing on

36:19.720 --> 36:21.360
that are doing the polishing.

36:21.360 --> 36:24.200
Now, I really don't want to take anything away from Plasma

36:24.200 --> 36:26.080
because I think in some ways it's great

36:26.080 --> 36:28.000
that we have something like Plasma out there

36:28.000 --> 36:29.520
that isn't tied to any particular distro

36:29.520 --> 36:31.300
that isn't being led around by Red Hat

36:31.300 --> 36:32.280
or something like that, right?

36:32.280 --> 36:33.880
Like, that's a good thing.

36:33.880 --> 36:36.240
That's also an advantage, yeah, absolutely.

36:36.240 --> 36:38.520
You have been trying to effect change, right?

36:38.520 --> 36:40.840
You have submitted bugs for some of the things.

36:40.840 --> 36:44.800
I mean, and that isn't something you have to do,

36:44.800 --> 36:47.160
but it is an option we have with free software

36:47.160 --> 36:49.000
that we don't necessarily have with the commercial stuff.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.640
Well, and actually what's been great about that process,

36:51.640 --> 36:54.280
and it first started a few months ago

36:54.280 --> 36:59.040
when we were participating in the Ubuntu beta testing,

36:59.040 --> 37:00.120
or at least I did.

37:00.120 --> 37:02.360
Some listeners may have as well, hopefully.

37:02.360 --> 37:05.400
And I did find some bugs doing upgrades

37:05.400 --> 37:07.680
between LTS versions.

37:07.680 --> 37:09.720
And it was actually really refreshing to be like,

37:09.720 --> 37:12.440
hey, I found this thing and I think no one else has found it

37:12.440 --> 37:13.960
or other people have,

37:13.960 --> 37:16.800
but I can share some extra information about it

37:16.800 --> 37:18.760
on my particular steps.

37:18.760 --> 37:22.000
And that was a refreshing perspective

37:22.000 --> 37:24.200
into the way that open source functions.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.720
And what's been really neat is watching,

37:27.720 --> 37:31.000
you automatically get tagged

37:31.000 --> 37:35.480
and track those conversations via email or whatever it is.

37:35.480 --> 37:38.440
And it's been fascinating to watch the discussions

37:38.440 --> 37:41.680
and the progress on some of these bugs throughout the months,

37:41.680 --> 37:45.240
both in a, I think in a good and bad way,

37:45.240 --> 37:46.440
I hesitate to use those words,

37:46.440 --> 37:48.720
but like some of the bugs are deemed,

37:48.720 --> 37:49.760
oh yeah, this is very serious,

37:49.760 --> 37:51.200
needs to be fixed before the release.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.640
And it gets all the attention and it gets solved,

37:53.640 --> 37:57.320
sometimes within a few hours or a few days.

37:57.320 --> 38:01.320
But then some bugs that seem at least to me from,

38:01.320 --> 38:05.000
let's say a slightly technically proficient end user,

38:06.200 --> 38:08.120
some bugs that seem super serious to me

38:08.120 --> 38:10.000
have gone months and months and months and months

38:10.000 --> 38:12.840
without any attention.

38:12.840 --> 38:13.920
Well, some people are paying attention,

38:13.920 --> 38:16.040
but without a fix, I'll say.

38:16.040 --> 38:18.600
So one in particular was,

38:18.600 --> 38:22.200
Kubuntu had a bug where you couldn't enter

38:22.200 --> 38:24.840
like their K-D-E-S-U function.

38:24.840 --> 38:26.600
So where you type in your pseudo password

38:26.600 --> 38:30.160
to bring up, to change some repos or something

38:30.160 --> 38:31.280
in the GUI, for instance.

38:31.280 --> 38:33.040
Yeah, that does seem like a bad one.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.400
Yeah, it would present a dialogue to you

38:35.400 --> 38:37.880
to put in your password, which is all good,

38:37.880 --> 38:41.120
but it would never ever accept any of your passwords,

38:41.120 --> 38:45.480
either the pseudo password or your known good password

38:45.480 --> 38:47.080
as the acceptable answer.

38:47.080 --> 38:50.320
It would just never ever let you in, basically.

38:50.320 --> 38:53.800
And it was just changed some fairly important functions.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.880
So you had to find ways around it.

38:55.880 --> 38:59.520
So I guess seasoned enough that I knew ways around it,

38:59.520 --> 39:02.040
but that seemed like a pretty big issue to me.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.040
And I was like, oh, this definitely needs some attention.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.480
Like this is very serious.

39:05.480 --> 39:09.360
And a potential fix to be tested was only sent out,

39:09.360 --> 39:14.280
I think last week, which really surprised me

39:14.280 --> 39:16.440
because we found these back in March, I think it was,

39:16.440 --> 39:18.560
and I'm not the only one to have found this bug.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.480
So it's been really fascinating to watch

39:20.480 --> 39:22.040
sort of the internals of the teams

39:22.040 --> 39:24.040
that are working on these things as well.

39:24.040 --> 39:26.480
So if anyone's interested in getting to learn

39:26.480 --> 39:29.120
the Linux desktop environment on a different level,

39:29.120 --> 39:32.040
I very highly recommend, you know,

39:32.040 --> 39:33.520
go find some bugs and submit some,

39:33.520 --> 39:35.920
or at least go look at some bug reports.

39:35.920 --> 39:37.160
It's an amazing thing.

39:37.160 --> 39:38.000
I'm getting excited.

39:38.000 --> 39:39.320
I'm getting so excited for you, Brent.

39:39.320 --> 39:41.080
This is such an exciting period

39:41.080 --> 39:42.280
you're going through right now.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.880
Oh, this is good.

39:44.880 --> 39:46.760
Well, have you been through this?

39:46.760 --> 39:47.600
It sounds like.

39:47.600 --> 39:48.440
Oh, sure, yeah.

39:48.440 --> 39:51.600
You're gonna get a whole new understanding

39:51.600 --> 39:53.760
of how free software is put together.

39:53.760 --> 39:57.520
And I think this is a super valuable understanding.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.200
Watching this process, what you talked about there,

39:59.200 --> 40:00.600
watching how the team works,

40:00.600 --> 40:01.800
seeing what things they go after,

40:01.800 --> 40:03.960
kind of see who some of the superstars are.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.840
How do you balance all the competing demands

40:06.840 --> 40:09.080
and bugs and issues and new features maybe?

40:09.080 --> 40:09.920
Yeah, yeah.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.800
Well, what's been even more interesting

40:11.800 --> 40:13.600
is from our website project,

40:13.600 --> 40:16.960
where now I've been sort of playing the person

40:16.960 --> 40:20.320
of the triaging bugs that we get in

40:20.320 --> 40:21.920
and priorities and stuff like that.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.600
Now I'm seeing, because of our own open source project

40:24.600 --> 40:27.640
with a bunch of listeners putting in their time

40:27.640 --> 40:29.640
and effort when they can on their specialty

40:29.640 --> 40:32.400
to make our website an amazing thing.

40:32.400 --> 40:35.520
Now I have the perspective of that other chair

40:35.520 --> 40:37.800
and that other hat of trying to organize

40:37.800 --> 40:39.360
all these competing priorities and stuff.

40:39.360 --> 40:44.240
So it has been a really fascinating time for me personally.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.720
And I think that's what I wanted to share here today

40:46.720 --> 40:48.920
is like, there's a lot of different ways

40:48.920 --> 40:52.280
of having perspective on the software that we're using.

40:52.280 --> 40:53.600
And that's kind of a beautiful thing

40:53.600 --> 40:55.480
in this open source environment.

40:55.480 --> 40:58.320
I wanna also take your point to the audience,

40:58.320 --> 41:01.480
maybe have them boost in with their thoughts.

41:01.480 --> 41:05.440
Is Plasma maybe getting a second rate implementation

41:05.440 --> 41:07.520
because it's on these spins and flavors

41:07.520 --> 41:10.040
and not the primary distro focus so often.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.120
And again, not to take anything away

41:12.120 --> 41:14.520
from like Kubuntu teams or Fedora spin team

41:14.520 --> 41:16.280
because we all use it.

41:16.280 --> 41:17.760
We love that project.

41:17.760 --> 41:18.760
We are so thankful for anything.

41:18.760 --> 41:20.840
We just wish they had more developers.

41:20.840 --> 41:23.280
And I'm wondering, are we off?

41:23.280 --> 41:24.800
Just somehow does the free software model

41:24.800 --> 41:26.200
and the development model for free software,

41:26.200 --> 41:28.240
does it kind of avoid this problem

41:28.240 --> 41:30.160
since it's all upstream development?

41:30.160 --> 41:31.680
Let us know your thoughts, boost it in

41:31.680 --> 41:35.320
or go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

41:38.280 --> 41:40.760
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

41:40.760 --> 41:42.760
Go get started with a free trial of teams

41:42.760 --> 41:44.400
or for an individual right now

41:44.400 --> 41:47.600
by going to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

41:47.600 --> 41:50.160
Bitwarden is the easiest way for yourself,

41:50.160 --> 41:52.960
an individual, a team, an open source project

41:52.960 --> 41:54.800
to share and sync sensitive data.

41:54.800 --> 41:56.040
It's fully customizable.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.240
There's all kinds of things that you can tweak,

41:58.240 --> 42:00.760
you can set, especially for those of you

42:00.760 --> 42:02.240
in the enterprise environment.

42:02.240 --> 42:04.360
And of course we love that Bitwarden is open source,

42:04.360 --> 42:07.040
trusted by millions in the community.

42:07.040 --> 42:09.360
It's of course what Wes and I use every single day

42:09.360 --> 42:11.000
for managing our passwords.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
You can manage your two factor authentication there

42:13.000 --> 42:14.880
and have it all in one spot.

42:14.880 --> 42:17.400
And it just syncs beautifully across the desktop

42:17.400 --> 42:19.160
and across mobile devices.

42:19.160 --> 42:20.840
And one of the very first things I install now

42:20.840 --> 42:23.920
when I set up a new Linux box is the Bitwarden Flatpak.

42:23.920 --> 42:25.760
Then I can get logged into all of my services

42:25.760 --> 42:28.040
and my sites and I can use secure,

42:28.040 --> 42:31.120
individual unique passwords for all of them.

42:32.640 --> 42:34.960
I just kept thinking to myself,

42:34.960 --> 42:37.040
how much more could Bitwarden do in 2022?

42:37.040 --> 42:38.760
How much more could they really do?

42:38.760 --> 42:39.800
They've done so much.

42:39.800 --> 42:41.240
They've added so many features,

42:41.240 --> 42:44.640
especially on mobile for both Android and iOS this year.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.320
And for the enterprise,

42:46.320 --> 42:48.160
cross domain identity management was huge.

42:48.160 --> 42:49.200
They just got to that.

42:50.080 --> 42:53.520
This week they're announcing fast mail alias generation.

42:53.520 --> 42:55.760
So if you're a fast mail user,

42:55.760 --> 42:58.440
fast mail has been added to the list of available options

42:58.440 --> 43:02.560
for generating an email address along Firefox relay

43:02.560 --> 43:04.840
and on Addy and simple login.

43:04.840 --> 43:06.760
So now you can have a unique username,

43:06.760 --> 43:09.960
a unique password and a unique email address

43:09.960 --> 43:12.640
for every site and service you use.

43:12.640 --> 43:14.160
That is ultimate security

43:14.160 --> 43:16.720
and Bitwarden just manages all of it for you.

43:16.720 --> 43:18.920
They just do it all for you.

43:18.920 --> 43:22.000
They generate it, they auto fill it, they sync it

43:22.000 --> 43:25.120
and they do it securely and it's all open source.

43:25.120 --> 43:28.640
And if you're a fast mail user, this just got real for you.

43:28.640 --> 43:29.760
I mean, how great is this?

43:29.760 --> 43:34.280
If you're an existing Bitwarden user, you just get this.

43:34.280 --> 43:36.200
I love this and I hear from you guys out there all the time,

43:36.200 --> 43:37.160
how much you love fast mail.

43:37.160 --> 43:39.200
So I'm super psyched for all of you.

43:39.200 --> 43:40.600
Bitwarden just keeps getting better.

43:40.600 --> 43:44.200
If you haven't switched yet or if a friend, a family member

43:44.200 --> 43:46.280
or maybe your workplace, your school place,

43:47.320 --> 43:48.720
if you see some practices

43:48.720 --> 43:50.280
that maybe Bitwarden could help with,

43:50.280 --> 43:51.320
you know what I'm talking about,

43:51.320 --> 43:52.960
passwords under the keyboard.

43:52.960 --> 43:53.840
We've all seen it.

43:54.800 --> 43:57.080
Give them bitwarden.com slash Linux.

43:57.080 --> 43:59.120
It's just a great way to support the show

43:59.120 --> 44:00.440
and get them on the straight and narrow

44:00.440 --> 44:01.520
to good password management,

44:01.520 --> 44:04.080
which is probably the number one thing they could do online

44:04.080 --> 44:05.920
to protect themselves.

44:05.920 --> 44:10.120
So go to bitwarden.com slash Linux, go try it out.

44:10.120 --> 44:13.320
The easiest way to sync, store and share sensitive data.

44:13.320 --> 44:16.520
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

44:20.240 --> 44:24.840
Tater boosts in this week with 2049 cents.

44:26.080 --> 44:29.720
I'm curious, what did you come up with on the photo front?

44:29.720 --> 44:32.480
I'm in the exact same boat.

44:32.480 --> 44:34.840
I have been testing out Synology Photos lately,

44:34.840 --> 44:37.840
but it really just doesn't cut it.

44:37.840 --> 44:40.680
The wife is especially unhappy with the lack of AI features

44:40.680 --> 44:42.760
that allow her to search for things like dog

44:42.760 --> 44:45.400
or Disney's Animal Kingdom.

44:45.400 --> 44:47.080
I've been using photo sync on iOS

44:47.080 --> 44:50.240
to at least get my pictures onto my unread NAS,

44:50.240 --> 44:52.400
albeit unorganized.

44:52.400 --> 44:55.680
You know, Tater, we got a lot of feedback about that.

44:55.680 --> 44:58.760
So what we're gonna do is a kind of roundup

44:58.760 --> 45:02.880
of some of the stuff that was sent in in the pics.

45:02.880 --> 45:06.120
And then we'll give you a little more information about it.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.600
We're gonna try some stuff ourselves

45:08.600 --> 45:10.560
and then give you like our official final

45:10.560 --> 45:13.320
like definitive setups for photo sync.

45:13.320 --> 45:16.560
But yeah, a lot of people had recommended NextCloud

45:16.560 --> 45:18.560
or they'd recommended PhotoPrism.

45:18.560 --> 45:21.000
And I did get a few people that said Synology Photos

45:21.000 --> 45:22.400
actually works well for them.

45:22.400 --> 45:24.600
So there's, you know, for those of you

45:24.600 --> 45:26.400
that do have a Synology, there's something to consider.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.840
Well, we've got a double boost from Tater

45:28.840 --> 45:33.480
with 2,048 SATs.

45:33.480 --> 45:34.560
Started off with a question there,

45:34.560 --> 45:37.480
but this one I think is a little pro tip.

45:37.480 --> 45:39.240
You mentioned the struggles of getting SATs

45:39.240 --> 45:41.600
into lightning wallets like Fountain.

45:41.600 --> 45:44.400
And I thought I'd share my recent discovery.

45:44.400 --> 45:48.160
No, it's not private like RoboSATs, but I like it anyway.

45:48.160 --> 45:49.600
It's the Cash app.

45:49.600 --> 45:51.520
I've been a user for years now.

45:51.520 --> 45:53.840
And I recently found out that their Bitcoin wallet

45:53.840 --> 45:56.160
in the app supports lightning.

45:56.160 --> 45:58.680
So sending SATs to Fountain was a piece of cake.

45:58.680 --> 46:00.360
Cash app's actually a great tip.

46:00.360 --> 46:02.960
And like right now, they got a boost in there.

46:02.960 --> 46:05.440
You get 5% back in Bitcoin on any food you buy

46:05.440 --> 46:06.760
in the Cash app.

46:06.760 --> 46:09.120
So you could, you know, buy yourself dinner

46:09.120 --> 46:11.000
and then boost those SATs in.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.520
You know, I'm constantly having to buy food for some reason.

46:14.520 --> 46:16.800
I know, it gets old, doesn't it?

46:16.800 --> 46:20.160
Okay, well, next up is a boost from our beloved Elray.

46:20.160 --> 46:21.880
Hey Elray, or is it Elry?

46:21.880 --> 46:24.360
Elry, you're right. Elray, Elry.

46:24.360 --> 46:26.640
I've just been saying Elray this whole time, so.

46:26.640 --> 46:28.800
See, I got it, I'm blaming Brett.

46:28.800 --> 46:30.800
But a solid contributor to our new website.

46:30.800 --> 46:32.680
Boost in and let us know.

46:32.680 --> 46:34.120
Oh yeah, absolutely.

46:34.120 --> 46:37.240
Elray boosts in with a row of ducks.

46:38.320 --> 46:41.080
Working in the offensive security field,

46:41.080 --> 46:43.440
I think I mostly agree with Chris's sentiment.

46:43.440 --> 46:47.000
A lot of antivirus software sucks.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.640
But there are a few AV or endpoint protection products

46:50.640 --> 46:53.960
that are actually really awesome, at least for Windows.

46:53.960 --> 46:56.120
They're working on making Linux better.

46:56.120 --> 46:57.160
All right.

46:57.160 --> 46:58.840
Here's a specific example.

46:58.840 --> 47:01.000
If I see CrowdStrike or a box

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
with an updated Windows Defender,

47:03.000 --> 47:05.160
I know I have to change my attack pattern

47:05.160 --> 47:09.040
to try and not get caught while I'm on that machine.

47:09.040 --> 47:12.280
All right, that actually is, you know, I remember that.

47:12.280 --> 47:13.440
When you see a piece of software, you're like,

47:13.440 --> 47:15.200
oh, all right, this is gonna be a little harder

47:15.200 --> 47:16.040
than I expected.

47:16.040 --> 47:17.560
That probably is the highest praise you could get

47:17.560 --> 47:18.680
for something like that.

47:18.680 --> 47:20.200
He kind of sums it up with, you know,

47:20.200 --> 47:24.240
AV isn't the best, but it's catching low-hanging fruit,

47:24.240 --> 47:26.880
which is pretty important for non-technical users.

47:26.880 --> 47:28.880
Sure, sure, that makes sense.

47:28.880 --> 47:32.360
Along these same lines, Entropic Ninja boosts in

47:32.360 --> 47:34.920
with a elite number of sets.

47:34.920 --> 47:36.920
Just listening to the discussion about malware

47:36.920 --> 47:40.640
and how Mac have integrated it at the OS level.

47:40.640 --> 47:44.440
To Chris's point about how scanning can tax a system,

47:44.440 --> 47:47.520
made me think about all those co-processors

47:47.520 --> 47:49.120
on Apple Silicon.

47:49.120 --> 47:52.640
Perhaps there might be some specific antivirus co-processors

47:52.640 --> 47:54.080
introduced in the near future.

47:54.080 --> 47:56.240
You know, I thought about this while we were talking

47:56.240 --> 47:57.360
about it in the show last week,

47:57.360 --> 47:59.320
but I didn't wanna derail us.

47:59.320 --> 48:01.600
But wouldn't that be the total Apple move,

48:01.600 --> 48:03.960
is to pretend like your platform was immune

48:03.960 --> 48:05.520
from malware forever, right?

48:05.520 --> 48:07.420
And oh, yeah, it's not us.

48:07.420 --> 48:10.180
Then, when you start to have a malware problem,

48:10.180 --> 48:12.380
you build it in at the system level, the protection,

48:12.380 --> 48:14.220
and build in co-processors after that,

48:14.220 --> 48:16.120
and be like, what, well, yeah, we have malware,

48:16.120 --> 48:18.560
but it doesn't impact the performance of your system.

48:18.560 --> 48:22.320
That is exactly what they're gonna do, right?

48:22.320 --> 48:24.400
Oh, boy, yeah, and you know, you gotta pay

48:24.400 --> 48:25.920
for those fancy co-processors.

48:25.920 --> 48:28.120
You get a co-processor, I get a co-processor,

48:28.120 --> 48:29.880
just all adds to the price.

48:31.700 --> 48:35.000
Neve boosted in with 2016 SATs.

48:35.000 --> 48:36.760
Coming in hot with the boost.

48:36.760 --> 48:38.360
You always get me with that one.

48:39.560 --> 48:40.560
It's our favorite.

48:40.560 --> 48:43.420
2016 was when we first heard the phrase,

48:43.420 --> 48:45.160
the year of the Linux desktop,

48:45.160 --> 48:47.720
which coincides with when Canonical was at the peak

48:47.720 --> 48:49.600
of its convergence hype train.

48:49.600 --> 48:51.000
Do you remember that?

48:51.000 --> 48:54.440
Ubuntu made the switch to the first LTS with SystemD,

48:54.440 --> 48:58.880
and had an ongoing phone and smart TV project.

48:58.880 --> 49:01.180
Manjaro also finally got popular.

49:01.180 --> 49:03.480
GNOME Shell finally reached usable,

49:03.480 --> 49:05.520
and Steam proved the test of time,

49:05.520 --> 49:07.660
lasting the four-year test,

49:07.660 --> 49:10.600
and showed the community Valve was in the long run

49:10.600 --> 49:13.640
with the Steam Machine and SteamOS 1.0.

49:13.640 --> 49:16.320
My last bit of history boosts, by the way.

49:16.320 --> 49:18.400
Neve, I loved your history boosts.

49:18.400 --> 49:20.280
What a wild year the 2016 was.

49:20.280 --> 49:21.600
I'm gonna miss the history boosts.

49:21.600 --> 49:22.560
I want more history boosts.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.120
Yeah, keep those coming.

49:24.120 --> 49:25.520
That was really fascinating.

49:25.520 --> 49:30.160
Steam 1.0 2016 seems like both,

49:30.160 --> 49:33.520
like Steam for Linux just happened yesterday,

49:33.520 --> 49:37.240
and I also feel like it was a decade ago.

49:37.240 --> 49:42.240
The thing for me, the personal story about Steam on Linux

49:43.020 --> 49:46.000
is that I heard it from Michael Larble

49:46.000 --> 49:47.800
and somebody else that I won't name,

49:47.800 --> 49:52.340
six months to nine months before it came to Linux,

49:52.340 --> 49:53.820
but I didn't know when.

49:53.820 --> 49:55.860
I just knew they were working on it,

49:55.860 --> 49:58.780
and I'd seen some really solid evidence.

49:58.780 --> 50:00.140
I didn't know if it was shipping,

50:00.140 --> 50:01.980
but I knew they had a client.

50:01.980 --> 50:03.620
I had seen screenshots.

50:03.620 --> 50:05.460
I had seen source code.

50:05.460 --> 50:07.140
I knew it was real.

50:07.140 --> 50:08.900
I just never knew if we were gonna get a product.

50:08.900 --> 50:10.420
I didn't know when or anything like that,

50:10.420 --> 50:13.100
so to me, so much of my experience

50:13.100 --> 50:14.740
about Steam coming to Linux

50:14.740 --> 50:16.920
was the anticipation of when,

50:16.920 --> 50:18.980
and trying to do that math and keep my mouth shut,

50:18.980 --> 50:20.580
but then also drop hints on air.

50:22.300 --> 50:24.220
So it feels like it was a real time.

50:24.220 --> 50:26.380
2016 was a solid year for Linux.

50:26.380 --> 50:27.600
That's all I know.

50:27.600 --> 50:31.140
Eric Pardee boosted in with 15,000 sats.

50:31.140 --> 50:32.900
B-O-O-S-T.

50:32.900 --> 50:35.340
Chris, I think this one's for you on some documentation.

50:35.340 --> 50:37.700
They write, readme.md, Chris,

50:37.700 --> 50:40.180
and todo.md, saves my bacon

50:40.180 --> 50:41.820
when I write ansible, terraform,

50:43.820 --> 50:45.800
future nix, ooh, I like that.

50:45.800 --> 50:48.620
Comments are great, good commit messages are also great,

50:48.620 --> 50:52.740
but a readme.md with how does this all work again notes

50:52.740 --> 50:56.140
that gets the overall gist is invaluable.

50:56.140 --> 50:57.100
Yeah, that is good advice.

50:57.100 --> 51:01.400
Readme.mds and todo.mds, always really invaluable.

51:01.400 --> 51:03.040
What about, but hold on, we gotta back up.

51:03.040 --> 51:05.220
What is, what is Pulumi?

51:05.220 --> 51:06.720
The next Nix.

51:06.720 --> 51:09.780
Is this like an ansible meets Nix meets something else?

51:09.780 --> 51:11.180
Ooh, a little sneaky.

51:11.180 --> 51:14.340
Oh, I think those are separate items, I believe.

51:14.340 --> 51:16.140
It's Pulumi, which is an existing thing,

51:16.140 --> 51:18.100
and then I think future Nix may be to imply

51:18.100 --> 51:20.740
that Eric will be trying out Nix soon.

51:20.740 --> 51:21.560
Well, Eric.

51:21.560 --> 51:22.400
That's how I understood it.

51:22.400 --> 51:24.500
Okay, thank you for the sage advice.

51:24.500 --> 51:26.380
I will take that to heart.

51:26.380 --> 51:29.540
I will try, I will write future Chris readmes.

51:29.540 --> 51:30.940
You know, like, and I'll put in there like,

51:30.940 --> 51:32.340
you really actually need to read this.

51:32.340 --> 51:34.660
You know, I'll put it in the title so I know it's from me

51:34.660 --> 51:35.780
and not some jerk.

51:36.880 --> 51:38.260
Be kind to yourself, Chris.

51:38.260 --> 51:39.820
It's kind of like the difference between like,

51:39.820 --> 51:41.140
you know, having a reference where you need

51:41.140 --> 51:43.060
the specific detail, which is where those comments are,

51:43.060 --> 51:44.940
like, oh, don't forget, you don't need to do it this way

51:44.940 --> 51:46.260
or it'll break.

51:46.260 --> 51:48.320
And then the readme is that high level thing

51:48.320 --> 51:49.840
where you're just like, what's the intention

51:49.840 --> 51:51.900
from the user, the human view?

51:51.900 --> 51:54.500
And then you can get into the specifics later.

51:54.500 --> 51:55.380
That's good to know.

51:55.380 --> 51:56.660
All right, thank you, Eric, and thank you

51:56.660 --> 51:59.780
for that healthy boost of 15,000 sats.

51:59.780 --> 52:04.780
The Muso, the Muso boosted in with 5,000 sats.

52:06.580 --> 52:08.060
Talking about Unity got me thinking

52:08.060 --> 52:11.300
about the one thing I miss, the menu bar.

52:11.300 --> 52:15.340
I love GNOME, but the move away from the menu bar saddens me.

52:15.340 --> 52:18.240
As a keyboard heavy user, the menu bar allowed me

52:18.240 --> 52:20.540
to quickly access functions that did not have

52:20.540 --> 52:22.340
a keyboard shortcut assigned.

52:22.340 --> 52:25.020
A simple Alt plus key and another key later,

52:25.020 --> 52:26.380
I could use a function.

52:26.380 --> 52:30.500
My opinion, the hamburger menus are not the answer.

52:30.500 --> 52:33.520
Sure, I could probably use KDE, but for various reasons,

52:33.520 --> 52:36.460
I prefer GNOME and the GTK ecosystem.

52:37.580 --> 52:41.020
I do not like the hamburger menu still.

52:41.020 --> 52:43.940
The overflow menu, as it's called now,

52:43.940 --> 52:47.300
and Apple's all in on it.

52:47.300 --> 52:49.580
The Home Assistant project just redesigned

52:49.580 --> 52:51.780
their automations UI in Home Assistant,

52:51.780 --> 52:53.840
and they've helpfully added many things

52:53.840 --> 52:55.880
to the overflow menu.

52:57.380 --> 53:00.860
It just feels like the ultimate UI lazy button.

53:00.860 --> 53:03.220
Ah, well, we couldn't figure out where to put these things,

53:03.220 --> 53:06.240
so one giant menu.

53:06.240 --> 53:09.620
You know, what's unfortunate is our website has one.

53:09.620 --> 53:11.740
Yeah, sure, of course, of course.

53:11.740 --> 53:12.580
This everything does.

53:12.580 --> 53:13.420
It's so handy.

53:13.420 --> 53:16.300
Everything it does, everything does.

53:16.300 --> 53:18.580
Everything has the hamburger menu now,

53:18.580 --> 53:21.140
and I just can't even with it.

53:21.140 --> 53:24.240
And I think part of it is because you can't put everything

53:24.240 --> 53:26.480
on the toolbar or whatever, right, for this stuff.

53:26.480 --> 53:29.620
You gotta, but there's still functions they wanna add.

53:29.620 --> 53:30.780
Ah, I feel that one.

53:30.780 --> 53:32.600
I'm just always struck whenever I go and use

53:32.600 --> 53:34.020
like old school Windows, you know,

53:34.020 --> 53:37.220
and like the Alt plus key is everywhere.

53:37.220 --> 53:38.580
I mean, you could just keyboard drive

53:38.580 --> 53:40.020
so many of those apps that way,

53:40.020 --> 53:41.900
and it's actually quite nice.

53:42.900 --> 53:44.540
That's my one good thing of Windows for the years.

53:44.540 --> 53:45.940
Okay, okay, I'll stop.

53:45.940 --> 53:48.740
I do agree, and consistently too,

53:48.740 --> 53:51.740
like the Windows keyboard shortcuts I learned years ago,

53:51.740 --> 53:54.300
I think for the most part are still valid, right?

53:54.300 --> 53:55.520
Most plasma apps too.

53:55.520 --> 53:57.020
It's really the Gnome stuff.

53:57.020 --> 53:57.860
Yeah.

53:57.860 --> 53:59.220
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

53:59.220 --> 54:02.660
All right, Gene being boosted with 15,000 SATs.

54:02.660 --> 54:04.900
He has two thoughts on open sourcing sound bites.

54:04.900 --> 54:08.780
Number one, be sure to use Git Elfs.

54:08.780 --> 54:09.700
What's a Git Elf, guys?

54:09.700 --> 54:11.260
Pardon?

54:11.260 --> 54:15.300
Hey guys, hey Brent, you're a GitHub guy now.

54:15.300 --> 54:17.060
You're a big GitHub guy now, Brent.

54:17.060 --> 54:20.500
Hey Brent, Brent, what's a Git Elf?

54:20.500 --> 54:22.340
What's a Git Elf, Brent?

54:22.340 --> 54:23.300
What is that?

54:23.300 --> 54:26.780
I think it's like, sort of like the paperclip guy in the.

54:26.780 --> 54:27.740
Huh?

54:27.740 --> 54:29.340
It's sort of like the paperclip guy.

54:29.340 --> 54:30.660
Clippy, yeah, that's the one.

54:30.660 --> 54:32.100
It just like, whenever you need help,

54:32.100 --> 54:33.300
you just hit the button,

54:33.300 --> 54:35.340
and it comes out and tries to help you.

54:35.340 --> 54:37.580
It's a little Linus Torvalds, but it looks like an elf.

54:37.580 --> 54:38.980
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

54:38.980 --> 54:40.460
You're right, I should be using that.

54:40.460 --> 54:42.340
That's a great tip, Gene being, thank you.

54:42.340 --> 54:43.660
I should be using that.

54:43.660 --> 54:45.100
Okay, so reading between the lines here.

54:45.100 --> 54:48.140
It's LFS, and that's large file support,

54:48.140 --> 54:49.900
which is a sort of add-on to Git,

54:49.900 --> 54:51.620
because it's not really designed to support

54:51.620 --> 54:53.540
giant binary files necessarily.

54:53.540 --> 54:55.660
So there's ways to integrate those in,

54:55.660 --> 54:57.980
a little better handling into the mix.

54:57.980 --> 54:59.100
Oh, links.

54:59.100 --> 55:00.100
You just use a link.

55:00.100 --> 55:00.940
You just link it.

55:00.940 --> 55:03.100
But can I get this Linus Elf thing?

55:03.100 --> 55:04.100
Because that sounds great.

55:04.100 --> 55:06.420
Number two, should be careful

55:06.420 --> 55:08.700
about the copyright side of things.

55:08.700 --> 55:09.960
Yes, that's true.

55:09.960 --> 55:10.800
It's a balance.

55:10.800 --> 55:13.140
It's been a balance between the fun of it all

55:13.140 --> 55:15.380
and the copyright of it all.

55:15.380 --> 55:18.220
So I feel like we need to find the right balance.

55:18.220 --> 55:20.660
So far, we've been leaning heavily on the fun side.

55:20.660 --> 55:23.220
Gene Bean had a few extra boosts.

55:23.220 --> 55:24.040
I love it.

55:24.040 --> 55:25.280
Gene Bean's a great supporter of the show,

55:25.280 --> 55:29.060
and I read some of those in the pre-show.

55:29.060 --> 55:31.400
Alex Gates, the podcasting 2.0 consultant,

55:31.400 --> 55:33.420
boosted with $15,000.

55:33.420 --> 55:35.500
We got some $15,000s, woo!

55:35.500 --> 55:36.340
That is great.

55:36.340 --> 55:37.160
You know what you all are?

55:37.160 --> 55:38.020
You're all back home ballers,

55:38.020 --> 55:40.020
but I'm not gonna play it.

55:40.020 --> 55:41.580
Okay, one more time for you all together.

55:41.580 --> 55:42.580
But that's it.

55:42.580 --> 55:43.420
That's it.

55:48.300 --> 55:49.620
Never again.

55:49.620 --> 55:52.260
But we had some solid $15,000 boosts.

55:52.260 --> 55:53.860
I felt like they deserved it.

55:53.860 --> 55:58.620
Alex says that we're working on podcasting 2.0 playlists

55:58.620 --> 56:00.540
that anyone can make and share,

56:00.540 --> 56:03.780
and then shows up as an RSS feed.

56:03.780 --> 56:04.620
What?

56:04.620 --> 56:06.420
That's a great idea.

56:06.420 --> 56:07.580
Frickin' love it.

56:07.580 --> 56:10.260
You know, I would love to do all of our episodes

56:10.260 --> 56:14.180
where we talk about managing and owning your own data,

56:14.180 --> 56:16.180
just like a whole self-sovereign data series

56:16.180 --> 56:17.020
of living some life.

56:17.020 --> 56:18.860
I mean, tags could just be playlists in that way, right?

56:18.860 --> 56:20.460
You just blew my mind.

56:20.460 --> 56:21.380
Keep us posted, Alex.

56:21.380 --> 56:22.260
Please do.

56:22.260 --> 56:23.820
Thor 502 boosted in.

56:23.820 --> 56:27.780
I think we screwed up with the 2048 stats.

56:27.780 --> 56:29.420
Just a heads up, guys.

56:29.420 --> 56:31.300
Wooden, who boosted in last week,

56:31.300 --> 56:32.820
is another way to say Odin.

56:34.140 --> 56:36.420
Yeah, you know the Allfather?

56:36.420 --> 56:38.060
It's Wo-Din.

56:38.060 --> 56:41.260
My dad didn't hang upside down in Yagisal.

56:41.260 --> 56:42.100
How do you say that?

56:42.100 --> 56:42.920
Ictrazil?

56:42.920 --> 56:43.760
Ictrazil.

56:43.760 --> 56:48.740
For nine days and nine nights to be referred to as lumber,

56:48.740 --> 56:50.380
as funny as that might be to you.

56:50.380 --> 56:51.220
Oh.

56:51.220 --> 56:52.840
Sorry, Thor.

56:52.840 --> 56:53.680
You got us wrong.

56:53.680 --> 56:55.540
I'm glad Thor has a podcasting 2.0 app.

56:55.540 --> 56:57.460
You know, Thor's going to new podcast apps.

56:57.460 --> 56:59.140
He's got himself a podcasting 2.0 app.

56:59.140 --> 57:00.380
You know, if he doesn't want to switch apps,

57:00.380 --> 57:02.580
he's sticking with Breeze or Boost CLI.

57:02.580 --> 57:04.600
Maybe he's using Albee, you know?

57:04.600 --> 57:05.440
I don't know what Thor's doing.

57:05.440 --> 57:06.300
Let us know, Thor.

57:06.300 --> 57:07.140
What's worked for you?

57:07.140 --> 57:07.980
Thor's pretty hip.

57:07.980 --> 57:08.860
That's what I hear.

57:08.860 --> 57:09.940
I wouldn't have thought.

57:09.940 --> 57:13.100
But you know, I suppose it makes sense

57:13.100 --> 57:15.820
when you think about it from like a math standpoint.

57:15.820 --> 57:18.300
He knows about newpodcastapps.com.

57:18.300 --> 57:19.800
He knows about that.

57:19.800 --> 57:21.140
Thank you everybody who did boost in.

57:21.140 --> 57:25.580
We got 11,000 stats from Forged Foe,

57:25.580 --> 57:26.860
but he didn't have a message.

57:26.860 --> 57:28.340
But we also wanted to thank Patrick

57:28.340 --> 57:29.740
for sending a row of ducks into the show,

57:29.740 --> 57:31.460
as well as everybody else who boosted in.

57:31.460 --> 57:33.260
We read all of your messages,

57:33.260 --> 57:35.620
and we're just kind of selectively picking the ones

57:35.620 --> 57:37.380
that really float our boat to put in the show,

57:37.380 --> 57:38.420
some make into the pre-show,

57:38.420 --> 57:39.560
then of course those baller boosts

57:39.560 --> 57:41.340
make it to the top of the show.

57:41.340 --> 57:44.060
And all of them help keep podcasting independent.

57:44.060 --> 57:45.060
Thank you everybody.

57:47.220 --> 57:49.780
Guys, we got an over-packed pick segment.

57:49.780 --> 57:52.860
We got a pop and picks segment over here.

57:52.860 --> 57:54.980
We wanted to kind of run through some of the ideas

57:54.980 --> 57:57.420
that were sent in for getting your photos

57:57.420 --> 57:59.340
off of your mobile device and onto your own system

57:59.340 --> 58:01.300
so you can back them up and display them.

58:01.300 --> 58:03.740
Number one with a bullet, Photosync came in,

58:03.740 --> 58:06.580
which is an app for iOS and Android.

58:06.580 --> 58:09.500
Thornbill, amongst others, sent them in to let us know,

58:09.500 --> 58:11.140
hey, you gotta try these out.

58:11.140 --> 58:12.840
And this is definitely one that you'll be hearing more about

58:12.840 --> 58:14.620
from us, I think, in the future.

58:14.620 --> 58:16.580
Photosync lets you transfer your photos

58:16.580 --> 58:19.900
and your videos from your machine, cross-platform,

58:19.900 --> 58:23.220
and it supports all kinds of backend network services.

58:23.220 --> 58:24.980
So pretty much anything you're doing,

58:24.980 --> 58:29.980
WebDAV, SMB, DropBizzle, I don't know what you're using,

58:30.180 --> 58:32.060
but it supports it, it's ridiculous.

58:32.060 --> 58:34.200
So that was sent in by a lot of folks.

58:34.200 --> 58:36.120
iDrive also was sent in.

58:36.980 --> 58:38.860
Another one of the kind of the same dealios,

58:38.860 --> 58:42.420
multi-computer cloud backup, get it off your device.

58:42.420 --> 58:44.300
The pricing is there.

58:45.940 --> 58:48.980
It's kind of expensive, but people were using it,

58:48.980 --> 58:50.300
so I thought I would mention it.

58:50.300 --> 58:51.580
Hey, photos are important.

58:51.580 --> 58:54.700
Same thing was mentioned, was boosted in by iBookie.

58:54.700 --> 58:58.060
He said, I have a server with PhotoPrism and SyncThing.

58:58.060 --> 59:00.620
SyncThing copies the photos from the phone to the server,

59:00.620 --> 59:02.780
and PhotoPrism imports and displays them

59:02.780 --> 59:04.820
from the SyncThing directory.

59:04.820 --> 59:05.660
I like that a lot.

59:05.660 --> 59:06.740
Yeah.

59:06.740 --> 59:08.820
SyncThing is not available for iOS.

59:08.820 --> 59:10.460
I have had good luck in the past using it

59:10.460 --> 59:11.980
to sync my photos on Android, though.

59:11.980 --> 59:14.020
Foldersync was also sent in.

59:14.020 --> 59:16.900
Purple Dog using Breeze sent that in with a row of ducks.

59:16.900 --> 59:18.860
It says, I'm using Foldersync on Android

59:18.860 --> 59:21.380
and then PhotoPrism as the progressive web app.

59:21.380 --> 59:22.680
What I'm really missing, though,

59:22.680 --> 59:26.140
is the ability to share an album.

59:26.140 --> 59:29.180
So Foldersync is an Android option.

59:29.180 --> 59:33.180
Photosync is an iOS and Android option.

59:33.180 --> 59:35.620
And PhotoPrism is the app that a lot of people

59:35.620 --> 59:38.460
are using to display them, but not everybody.

59:38.460 --> 59:41.540
There's a lot here, and we got a lot of emails about this.

59:41.540 --> 59:44.060
Here's what I'd like to know.

59:44.060 --> 59:46.820
We'd like some hands-on experience examples.

59:46.820 --> 59:48.940
We want to take in a lot of the feedback,

59:48.940 --> 59:50.420
kind of have the audience give us

59:50.420 --> 59:52.520
their reports on using things like Photosync

59:52.520 --> 59:54.380
and Foldersync and PhotoPrism.

59:54.380 --> 59:55.220
Yeah, what worked well,

59:55.220 --> 59:57.140
what let you down in a critical moment.

59:57.140 --> 59:59.460
Yeah, what went wrong, how did you recover,

59:59.460 --> 01:00:00.740
those kinds of stories.

01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:04.220
You can boost them in or go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:05.840
We want to try to collate as much of that

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.300
so we can kind of get some meta observations

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.160
that we can use to inform our commentary,

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.260
and then we want to come back to you guys

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:15.380
and tell you what apps we picked for our photo solutions

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:17.680
and what worked, what didn't work,

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:20.580
and if we can, give as much step-by-step instruction

01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:22.300
as we can on a podcast.

01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:23.980
So that's kind of where we want to take this segment

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:26.580
ultimately, and just kind of gonna be driven

01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:28.520
by how much input we get from you guys.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.700
We have some, we've gotten some good stuff.

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.300
I'd like a little bit more in terms of actual

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:35.580
hands-on usage and some horror stories.

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.460
And also if you ended up going back to Google Photos,

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:39.660
tell us what went wrong and why and that kind of stuff.

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:40.740
All that would be really valuable

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.500
because that's all experience that we can then use

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:44.340
to inform our commentary and relate to the audience

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:46.960
because we'd like to create a definitive

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.180
take control of your photos,

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:50.380
get away from Google Photos episode

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.660
that people can get referred to.

01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:55.160
Because we gotta do it, we gotta do it.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.000
We gotta do it.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.180
I mean, if not us, who?

01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:58.340
Who?

01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:59.420
Who?

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.660
It's just time.

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:01.500
I think it's time.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.340
We waited too long and now we gotta double down on it.

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:07.340
So let us know how it's worked, how it hasn't worked,

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.660
the good and the bad.

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:12.460
And of course, don't forget next Sunday

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:14.500
is our last live stream in the studio

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:15.660
before we hit the road.

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.040
Brent's gonna be here.

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.020
We should think about food.

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.740
Oh, I think we must feast.

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.780
Yeah, we're gonna have to feast.

01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:24.500
We're gonna be putting on quite the show.

01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:26.380
Maybe we just live stream all day, I don't know.

01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.500
It's gonna be weird, you know?

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.540
I mean, you're gonna be up here in Seattle.

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:30.620
We're gonna be gone.

01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:33.940
We're gonna be having a great time, you know?

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:34.780
I'm already feeling that.

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:37.300
You're gonna be stuck here at the studio.

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:38.900
You know, it's gonna be weird.

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:41.940
But I'll have full control of the soundboard.

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.260
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:46.420
We finally fired your soundboard guy.

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:48.220
You're cut off.

01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:49.540
It's been a lot better.

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:52.700
Been noticing a lot less rust sound bites, that's why.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:53.980
That soundboard guy brought the rust clip

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:55.360
and that was it, and that's all he ever did.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:56.380
I don't know what kind of hire that was.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:57.740
He's worth the salary, let me tell you.

01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.060
I don't know about that.

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.160
But we'd love to see you next week.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.020
We do it at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:02.980
over at jupyter.tube.

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.660
That is our self-hosted Peertube instance.

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:05.940
See you next week.

01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:08.460
Same bad time, same bad station.

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:11.820
And don't miss Linux Action News.

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.060
We covered some underwater Linux data centers

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.740
that are going live in our backyard

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.100
here in the Pacific Northwest,

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.560
and everything else going on in the world

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:20.000
of Linux and free software.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.180
There's a whole other companion to this show.

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.700
It's tight, concise, just the information you need.

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.620
LinuxActionNews.com.

01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:27.820
Links to what we talked about today,

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:31.180
that's at LinuxUnplugged.com, slash, 475,

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.560
and of course, at the new website, too.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.020
Over at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:36.820
Go check that sucker out.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.580
It's a doozy.

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:40.740
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:42.080
of the Unplugged program.

01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:46.600
I think we're gonna see you right back here next Sunday.

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:47.440
Hey.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:24.200
I think we should spread the love just a little bit.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:29.280
You did try out Gnome after having some plasma frustrations.

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.560
Ooh, that could be a good title.

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.080
Plasma frustrations.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.520
And so we said, all right, okay, Brent.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:36.520
Okay then, Brent.

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.520
All right, Brent.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:38.520
Go try out Gnome.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:39.520
See how that goes for you, Brent.

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.520
How did it go for you, Brent?

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:46.480
Yeah, I think we decided that was it last Sunday when we were thinking about this episode

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:51.920
and we thought, okay, well, it's only fair to go try the dark side.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:55.680
You know, I haven't actually, here's, here's something, I've never actually spent much

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.480
time in Gnome because I've been so happy with, with plasma.

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:06.760
So I only have like, at most hours in Gnome before this.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.720
But Chris, you put it to me and you, I know, I know.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:12.720
But Chris, you put it to me and you said, well, give it a shot for like a week and see

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.720
what happens.

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:17.040
And I did, and it was enlightening so far.

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.080
Unfortunately it wasn't, I was expecting it to be a polished, wonderful experience.

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:28.480
Now I did choose Fedora's Gnome implementation because I figured, okay, at the time on my

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:34.320
main laptop here, I've got Fedora's implementation of KDE, so I thought, okay, well, let's change

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:39.600
the fewest things possible and just switch to, you know, the Gnome desktop environment.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:40.600
All right.

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:41.600
That makes sense.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:46.480
Maybe than my previous experiences trying to change only one variable.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:52.440
And I ran into a lot of problems, a ton of problems, many, many, many, many bugs that

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:58.520
helpfully the Gnome bug reporter helped me file a whole bunch of them.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:04.400
But one of the ones that was worrying was the kernel core had 15 occurrences of problems,

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:09.160
system failures, it called it, that were just kept getting collected and collected.

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:14.760
I had some random abrupt black screens that would just happen in the middle of, you know,

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:18.840
I'm in the middle of working on the website and all of a sudden, you know, I've written

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:24.200
this whole like a reply to someone or a new issue and it's like paragraphs long.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:29.000
And all of a sudden my system just like vanished before my eyes and I couldn't do anything

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.000
to, you know, I couldn't use the keyboard to get to a terminal.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.680
I couldn't even put it to sleep or anything to try to like.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:38.920
That sounds like Mudder or Wayland is crashing on you.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:45.560
Yeah, it was Wayland and I had some extra issues with Wayland, which I've experienced

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:49.440
on other Wayland systems, which is poor video playback.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:52.480
But you were primarily X11 before, right?

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:54.240
On your Plasma, in your Plasma days?

01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.240
Yeah.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:59.640
So this is always, this is also a little bit new Wayland territory for me as well.

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:01.160
But I've been disappointed, to be honest.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:05.360
That's kind of what I was getting at in the show is what I think makes this tricky is

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:11.560
if you look back over the last five, six years of Linux, you've gone through so many transitions

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:15.200
that like it's hard to say where in the stack you're actually bumping problems that maybe

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:18.240
on an older system, you know, you didn't.

01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:24.920
Although I got to tell you, like if I ever, if I ever had what you're going through happen

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:28.600
to me more than once, I would not use any of these systems.

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:29.600
Like that would be it.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:30.920
I don't got time for that.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:36.120
I know that's, and that's how I started feeling this week was like, I almost put up my hands

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.720
and just said, you know, it's, it's only Thursday.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.600
I didn't even make it to Sunday again.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.720
And I can't do this anymore.

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:44.440
I wonder how this is going to go on the dev one.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.600
Well that I'm interested.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:46.900
Could this be hardware?

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:48.480
Could some of this be hardware?

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:55.520
Like potentially I, so one of the main systems I'm using here is an X250 and okay, Alex and

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:58.620
I like Frankenstein this thing, but it's been pretty stable.

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:03.600
And then my workstation as well was what I was using gnome on because I didn't quite

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.600
want to wipe this.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:07.980
I was really hesitant to do that, uh, especially with the travels coming up.

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:12.840
And so I ran it on a completely different system and uh, so yeah, it could be hardware.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.120
They're both old dish.

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:18.520
They don't have that much cat hair in them, but it could be, you know, that's a possibility.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:22.840
I was just wondering if you'd like the, I mean, not that pops totally made for that,

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:26.720
but you know, in the, in a system that's sort of a little more integrated and not coupled

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:28.000
together, it might be something up your alley.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.360
You mean the pop gnome experience?

01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:30.360
Yeah.

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:33.480
I was thinking he might like the pop gnome or the Ubuntu gnome experience.

01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:38.680
Cause the thing about Fedora is it's a real upstream experience, right?

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.760
So you're getting basically factory gnome.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:46.800
And I like that because then I know I add these 17 extensions and everything's fine,

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:51.160
but you don't have, you know, literally six years or so of playing around with various

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.820
extensions to know which ones just to go to, right?

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:58.480
That to me is just built in knowledge now, um, where something like, you should publish

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.360
a feed of the extensions you're currently using.

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:05.120
I wish that's where something like pop and Ubuntu, you know, they've done a little curation

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:06.440
in that experience.

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:11.860
Well, that's, what's really fascinating to me is I feel like, at least for me personally,

01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:15.600
when I jump on a plasma machine, I'm, I don't really need to add anything.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:20.320
It's got most of the things I want, but it's got more than any desktop environment has.

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:21.320
It's got everything.

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:22.320
Yeah.

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:23.320
Fair enough.

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:24.320
Yeah.

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:28.360
And also I'm aware that I have, you know, five years worth of experience with it.

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:32.040
So of course I'm going to lean towards preferring the thing that's familiar, right?

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.200
That I have in mind as well.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:40.160
But you know, you have sort of convinced me that you've been happier with gnome more now

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.160
than ever.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.160
Yeah.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.160
Yeah, I have.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.160
Yeah.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.440
That's sort of why I lean towards using the fedora implementation was that you seem really

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:46.600
happy with it.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:51.300
You did hesitate with like wanting to give me the, the preset up version, which is sort

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:54.920
of what pop pop is doing and what, you know, who Bunty is doing.

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:58.400
Uh, I just went crazy and figured, okay, well I'm just going to try it just the way it is

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.240
cause I want to see it from the ground up.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.640
And that I did that I did.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.640
Yeah.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.720
I wonder if you saw my set up, what you'd think of it.

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:06.720
You might soon.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.720
Yeah, you will.

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:08.720
Yeah.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:09.960
I'm curious what you're going to throw on the dev one for me.

01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.960
Yeah.

01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:16.080
Well, we have, we have a little something to start with, don't we have that USB here

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.080
today.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:24.560
This should be entertaining, so I think we have a whole episode dedicated to these shenanigans.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:51.120
Is that how it's going?
