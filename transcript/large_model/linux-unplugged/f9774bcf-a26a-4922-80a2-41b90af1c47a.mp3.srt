1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Yara.io? What do you think, Wes?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,240
Yara.io?

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,080
Yaro!

4
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,540
What, no, you're, no.

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,000
But this does look pretty cool,

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,640
and it's yet another Raspberry Pi handheld device.

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,720
This one takes advantage of the Raspberry Pi OS,

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,720
it just uses their OS.

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,720
It's a handheld that I'd say hearkens back

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,260
to the Game Boy 3DS Flip-style device,

11
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,660
but it has a full-corded keyboard and a trackpad,

12
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,500
so it's slightly larger.

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,360
Let's just say rugged and durable.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,740
Yeah, it does have very much like you could take this

15
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,940
to a construction site kind of look to it.

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,700
It's got a five-inch resistive touchscreen

17
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,740
that runs at 800 by 480,

18
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,080
and they say the display actually has

19
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,420
pretty decent color representation.

20
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,540
With the keyboard on there, you know,

21
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,580
you could type out into an SSH session,

22
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:50,280
you can run XFCE on this thing,

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,180
you get access to the Pi's GPIO connection,

24
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,660
so you could hook it up to devices on the go.

25
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,820
And it's kind of neat how they've wired it all together.

26
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,420
It looks, when you open it up,

27
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,300
the way they've integrated the battery and the wiring

28
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,360
and all of that, it really looks like

29
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,660
a legit consumer product.

30
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,360
Yeah, right, and at the same time,

31
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,200
they've spent a bunch of work on hackability,

32
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,900
making sure that, like, you can actually source

33
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,840
every single component, no custom PCBs,

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,000
and just a bit of soldering required,

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,440
which, that's pretty cool.

36
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,820
Little bit of soldering, maybe 15 hours of labor.

37
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,420
That's all it takes.

38
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:33,420
Hello, friends, and welcome to 370

39
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,220
of your weekly Linux talk show.

40
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,160
My name is Chris.

41
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,260
My name is Wes.

42
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,440
Wes, I love it when we hit, like, the 10 mark,

43
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,600
you know, the new, when we click over, love it.

44
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,980
Just feels right.

45
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,440
It feels like we did something,

46
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,540
even though it's totally arbitrary.

47
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,380
Thanks, math.

48
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,680
Well, also, I want to say thank you to a Cloud Guru

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,480
for sponsoring this episode of Unplugged.

50
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,380
So many career possibilities in the cloud, so little time.

51
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,260
ACG's learning paths help you take the right courses

52
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,220
to prepare for architects or developers, security jobs,

53
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,320
and many other high-paying cloud jobs.

54
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,100
Get hired, get certified, get learning at cloud.guru.

55
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,400
Also, hello there to Drew.

56
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,340
Welcome back in.

57
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,400
Hello, hello.

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,340
Hi, Drew, did you finish up the sausage,

59
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,100
or are you still munching on that over there?

60
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,500
Eh, no, I'm done with it for now.

61
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,680
Did you bring enough for the class?

62
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,240
Just under the wire.

63
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,120
Too bad you guys aren't here in person today,

64
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,920
because I'm rocking a blazer today.

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,920
Mm.

66
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,760
A blazer.

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,980
I can hear how fancy you sound just in the voice.

68
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,820
Right?

69
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,060
It's the shoulder pads.

70
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,900
I think they do something for the acoustics.

71
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,060
Classy Chris.

72
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,520
All right, before we go any further,

73
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,260
let's also bring in the virtual lug.

74
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,800
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

75
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,340
Hello.

76
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,160
Howdy.

77
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,000
Good evening.

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,100
Hello, all 32 of you.

79
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,340
We also have a couple of special guests

80
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,600
who will be joining us in just a couple of minutes

81
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,020
to give us the story directly from the source.

82
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,380
So we'll get to them in a moment.

83
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:00,020
But we start out with some news that I bet a lot of you,

84
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,580
if you follow the last couple of episodes,

85
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,380
are maybe aware of, I hope.

86
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,580
But I'm very excited to say that Linux Action News

87
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,860
is back with episode 153.

88
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,700
It has a special place in my heart, that show.

89
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,820
But also, I arrogantly thought,

90
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,260
oh, we'll pick up a lot of the slack here in Linux Unplugged

91
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,820
and cover all of the news, and it'll be fine.

92
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,340
And didn't really pan out.

93
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:25,380
It just didn't really, it was too much of a lift.

94
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,620
There's too much news.

95
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,460
That's right.

96
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,140
And it deserves its own show.

97
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,480
But also, there's an analysis aspect to Linux Action News.

98
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,920
We do our homework for that show,

99
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,020
and we try to do the research

100
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,740
and often reach out for contacts

101
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,300
and try to get the story from people

102
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,940
and then incorporate that into the commentary.

103
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,820
And it's just the sole focus of that show,

104
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,060
and that's what makes it special.

105
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,340
And that often means it's less than 30 minutes.

106
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,620
So linuxactionnews.com, go grab that.

107
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,540
And as these new shows start back up,

108
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,260
because we just also relaunched Dakota Radio,

109
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,720
as we bring things back,

110
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,900
the best place to really stay in the loop

111
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,580
is the All Shows feed.

112
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,500
Because as we relaunch these shows or bring a new show on,

113
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,040
that's one of the first places it'll show up

114
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,420
is the Jupiter Broadcasting All Shows feed.

115
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,080
So you might search for that in your podcatcher

116
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,420
or go grab it from the website,

117
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,800
because that's really your best solution.

118
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,900
But do check out both those,

119
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,820
Koda Radio and Linux Action News is back.

120
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,160
This first story, that's not about us,

121
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,820
brings me back to the old days

122
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,620
of me trying to use Linux in a corporate environment,

123
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,620
an all Windows corporate environment.

124
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,820
Oh gosh.

125
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,780
I couldn't imagine news like this,

126
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,080
but it appears just under the wire,

127
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,900
even actually after the feature freeze,

128
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,260
Ubuntu 2010's Ubiquiti installer,

129
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,880
which is used by the Ubuntu desktop version,

130
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,060
is gonna see Active Directory integration.

131
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,200
The feature freeze exception was sought and granted

132
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,460
for adding this optional Active Directory support

133
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,380
to the Ubuntu desktop installer.

134
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,700
How is this actually gonna work?

135
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,540
Well, during user setup in Ubiquiti,

136
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,620
there'll be a little checkbox

137
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,460
for enabling Active Directory logins.

138
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,020
Once it's checked, a user can log in

139
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,620
to an Active Directory configuration on their network,

140
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,460
while, and this is probably key for some people out there,

141
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,400
still creating a local Ubuntu account

142
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,660
for administration purposes.

143
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,260
The installer will then allow,

144
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,100
specifying the domain, the administrator, the password,

145
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,500
and a nice little test configuration to go test

146
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,740
to make sure that your domain connection

147
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,060
is actually up and running.

148
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,320
This is great to see.

149
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,420
This is really wonderful.

150
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,820
I'll tell you, the first time I ever saw this,

151
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,700
and it's always been hit and miss over the years,

152
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,920
although I imagine now it's gotten nailed down pretty well.

153
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,220
First time I ever saw this was baked into Yast,

154
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,780
and Yast also had the option

155
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,660
to launch an Active Directory server itself,

156
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,840
and there were a couple of cracks at this

157
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,140
with Mandriva and Xandros as well,

158
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,220
and one of the reasons I even used Xandros

159
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,860
for a little while, which is based on Debian,

160
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,140
was because it promised really good Active Directory support

161
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,820
with a back then, what was called a KDE desktop.

162
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,580
Now, this is looking like a pretty good release.

163
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,860
2010 is gonna have Open ZFS improvements,

164
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,340
it's gonna have Kernel 5.8,

165
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,740
and GNOME 3.38 as well as what Wes just talked about,

166
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,380
and a bunch of other package updates.

167
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,900
Something to look forward to.

168
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,860
Isn't it nice to see that kind of stuff landing,

169
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,560
and it really helps Linux be a first-class citizen

170
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,680
in a corporate environment.

171
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,540
Right, that's kind of what stuck in my mind,

172
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,260
as clearly Canonical has seen this,

173
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,100
has talked to folks out in the field

174
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,160
who are trying to use this awesome Linux desktop,

175
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,720
but still have some classic legacy administrators out there,

176
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,380
and once you've got this big Active Directory setup,

177
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,920
you're not just gonna toss that by the side,

178
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,760
you're still gonna use it,

179
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,560
it's got all of this information in it,

180
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,180
so if we can just play nice,

181
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,380
all the easier to slip Linux on it.

182
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,780
Yeah, and it's not just about the authentication

183
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,440
for logins, which we talk about a lot,

184
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,660
but in an established Active Directory environment,

185
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,940
those user IDs are tied to groups

186
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,940
that may be very possibly your email distribution groups

187
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,040
are based off of.

188
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,720
Certainly the file rights on the company shares

189
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,760
are based off of these Active Directory accounts.

190
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,820
Lots of applications for enterprise

191
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,140
integrate with Active Directory,

192
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,380
so you can even manage security key card access

193
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,380
via Active Directory account status.

194
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,140
The list goes on and on and on,

195
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,220
and so when you get access to that,

196
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,620
you become part of that ecosystem,

197
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,460
because that means also now the Linux system

198
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,020
that you're using will understand

199
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,460
that this group ID on the file server

200
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,940
translates to this actual group,

201
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
and yes, you are a member of that,

202
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,780
and you can get access to it,

203
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,140
and you can change file permissions,

204
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,980
and you can actually participate in this broader ecosystem,

205
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,500
so it has a lot of knock-on effects.

206
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,860
There's always a lot of knock-on effects

207
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,300
when Debian makes changes, talking about Ubuntu,

208
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,900
and there is some news out of DebConf 20,

209
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,380
which concluded last week.

210
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,620
Debian project leader Jonathan Carter gave his talk

211
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,940
at the event as well as an overview

212
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,620
of where the project is today,

213
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,940
and some of the problems that he believes they are facing.

214
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,700
Debian's finances are sitting around

215
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,980
a healthy 896,000 US dollars.

216
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,920
Thanks to COVID-19, actually,

217
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,740
there was less travel and conference expenses.

218
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,820
I wouldn't call it a surplus,

219
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,740
but they haven't spent as much as they expected.

220
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,660
Carter also noted as part of their fund,

221
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,340
Debian is in the process of acquiring

222
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,580
two new Lenovo servers.

223
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,100
They were able to obtain a discount, it appears,

224
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,320
to help in their efforts.

225
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,100
As for the health of their archive,

226
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,500
well, Debian is up to offering

227
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,820
around 61,000 AMD64 packages, oh my,

228
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,180
and around 31,000 source packages.

229
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,140
Another exciting item moving forward

230
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,220
is the possibility of Lenovo or other OEMs

231
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,020
offering a Debian preloaded system,

232
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,340
but before that can happen,

233
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,940
there are still some support concerns

234
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:33,100
and other technical issues to work through.

235
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,180
Now, that's interesting, huh,

236
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,300
because we're seeing that Fedora

237
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,300
has launched on the X1 Carbon,

238
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,380
and we know that Ubuntu, not too far behind,

239
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,580
and now it sounds like maybe Lenovo's even open

240
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,300
to the idea of straight up Debian.

241
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,980
Now, the other thing they talked about,

242
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,800
and this always gets in my craw,

243
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,140
is needing to improve quote unquote marketing.

244
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,780
They say it's an issue common to many open source projects,

245
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,620
but Debian especially, often saying it's an unsung hero

246
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,940
underneath the likes of Ubuntu and Steam OS.

247
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,060
Now, I'm not gonna get on my whole soapbox

248
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,060
about this, we have too much to get into today,

249
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,620
but I really hate when we do this to ourselves.

250
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,220
I think it's a lack of perception and perspective

251
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,660
of where Linux is and its role in the marketplace

252
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,700
and the type of consumer that's drawn to it.

253
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,260
I think it is a lack of understanding the dynamics

254
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,920
of the wider ecosystem.

255
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,300
It's a good comparative to understand this to

256
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,780
would be Android.

257
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,700
No one who buys an Android device quote unquote no one,

258
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,240
going by the numbers,

259
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,740
knows that Android is using Linux under the hood, right?

260
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,300
But we all do, just like everyone listening

261
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,540
and you all in the mumble room,

262
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,460
you all know that Ubuntu is based on Debian.

263
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,460
This slice of the market knows that.

264
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,260
And that, as a technical project,

265
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,020
is your best chance of who you're gonna market to.

266
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,860
You're not gonna-

267
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,380
I wonder though, maybe that's,

268
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,420
is that what they're getting at here though?

269
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,780
Because I feel like maybe there is,

270
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:58,980
I agree on the larger part, like marketing the Debian,

271
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,620
the nitty gritty to the wider user experience,

272
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,900
but maybe even amongst the Linux in the know folks,

273
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,180
sort of take Debian for granted, we forget about it.

274
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,540
I mean, how much do we even talk about it here on the show?

275
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,460
I think you could argue there's reasons

276
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,820
beyond marketing for that.

277
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,620
There seems to be certain areas

278
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,060
that the project doesn't engage in

279
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,380
and other areas that they seem to engage in.

280
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,440
And they seem to spend a lot of time spinning internally

281
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,100
and a lot of energy spent doing that.

282
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,340
I think they do have a perception problem,

283
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,140
but none of this is actually marketing.

284
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,020
So marketing implies that if you could buy a page

285
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,860
in a magazine or buy some banner ads on a website

286
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,820
that people would be flocking to your distribution

287
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,420
and give it more respect for what it does.

288
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,100
But that's, even when I just verbalize what they're implying,

289
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,760
it sounds ludicrous.

290
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,700
Well, that's like a general conception of marketing,

291
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,140
but couldn't it also mean just having more resources spent

292
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,160
at, well, once we're doing that again, at meetups,

293
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,340
at mentioning all the things that Debian is used for

294
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,180
at better integration with partners that are using Debian,

295
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,240
better representation in cloud marketplaces perhaps?

296
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,340
Yeah, I think that is an area they will invest in.

297
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,820
And that is totally an area that makes sense.

298
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,180
But if you think about who you're reaching there,

299
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,920
you're reaching probably that kind of tier of the market

300
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,960
that I was talking about.

301
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,260
People that already know about Debian,

302
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,220
but maybe just don't think about it a lot.

303
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,320
Right, that could be a good way to go.

304
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,020
When I look at Debian as like an outside observer,

305
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,700
I see something that I have a deep appreciation

306
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,560
and respect for, borderline love fest for really.

307
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,560
There's a few things out there

308
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,780
that have been with us for so long.

309
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,680
And so for me, Debian was the distribution when I used it,

310
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,440
I realized, oh, I can switch to Linux.

311
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,980
Like I had used Red Hat, which was, you know,

312
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,380
the good old bad days of RPMs

313
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,760
and manually solving RPM dependencies.

314
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,060
Like we're going way back here, right?

315
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,760
And then I switched over to Debian and apt came along

316
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,400
and it changed my mind

317
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,660
of how a computer can help me manage it.

318
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,760
I have a deep appreciation for Debian,

319
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,600
but when I try to think of what they're doing in the space

320
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,100
that gets people to talk about them,

321
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,800
I can't really enumerate much.

322
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,240
Like I don't see anybody at Debian

323
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,640
pioneering arm development and champion that.

324
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,640
I haven't heard about any big OEM deals with Debian.

325
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,280
And I'm not saying these things are necessary,

326
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,080
but if you do want chatter, if you want buzz,

327
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,680
you kind of have to do something

328
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,760
that people will talk about.

329
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,720
Yeah, that's a good point.

330
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,680
And maybe we should note too that Carter believes

331
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,220
that they need two to three times

332
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,620
their current volunteer levels

333
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,460
to accomplish all of their goals.

334
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,300
He also feels Debian is too lacking in the area of diversity

335
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,640
and not catching up fast enough.

336
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,700
Partially the blame there is, you know, large regions

337
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,200
of the world not being represented

338
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,540
and the people making and maintaining Debian

339
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,940
and maybe failing to put together a timely message

340
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,040
regarding Black Lives Matter and other recent concerns.

341
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,740
That kind of raises off the mark to me.

342
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,380
If that's what they think is not driving contributions,

343
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,580
again, I don't think they're properly assessing the market,

344
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,480
but I may be wrong, what do I know?

345
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,580
I'm just some dumb podcaster in the Seattle area,

346
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,660
so don't listen to me.

347
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,900
It's fascinating in either case that we sort of get

348
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,920
to watch this discussion going on, right?

349
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,260
That's true, and at least it's happening.

350
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,760
There's that as well, so that I appreciate.

351
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,960
I want to talk about PipeWire.

352
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,000
It's been a little while since we've done an update

353
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,300
on PipeWire, and it looks like over the late summer

354
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,100
and before, there has been some significant developments.

355
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,580
PipeWire is increasingly getting ready

356
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,720
for more user testing, and if you recall,

357
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,580
this is the Red Hat project for better audio

358
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,180
and video stream management on Linux,

359
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:22,920
and it's increasingly getting close to shipping time.

360
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,260
Yeah, PipeWire lead developer, Wim Tamens,

361
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,760
feels that the code is at a state where PulseAudio,

362
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,900
Jack, and also backends are usable,

363
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,840
I mean, if not 100% feature complete,

364
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,400
and actually, it's in good enough shape

365
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,280
that he and others at the Red Hat desktop team

366
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,400
are hoping to see more user testing happen

367
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,740
with the latest PipeWire code.

368
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,240
It now has a fully functioning session manager

369
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,440
with Wire Plumber, human readable handling of audio devices,

370
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,920
hey, that's pretty important,

371
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,820
support for creating audio sync devices with Jack,

372
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,220
hey-o, and support for creating devices with GStreamer,

373
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,800
among a bunch of other great improvements.

374
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,020
Well, to talk about all of this is lead developer, Wim.

375
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,960
He joins us now.

376
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,160
It's been a little while, Wim.

377
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,560
Welcome back to the show.

378
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,100
Hi, hello, everybody.

379
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,100
Hello, and congratulations

380
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,800
on the continued work with PipeWire.

381
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,240
It sounds like we're getting pretty close

382
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,340
to production ready, is that right?

383
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,620
Well, pretty close is a lot to say,

384
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,680
but it's ready for testing.

385
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,520
Okay.

386
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,520
So I expect at least six months of testing.

387
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,920
You know, I was looking back,

388
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,120
you were on the show in October of 2018,

389
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,800
and one of the things that we focused on a lot

390
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,320
in that conversation was the need for a session manager.

391
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,900
In fact, I think it was maybe the bulk of our discussion.

392
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,300
Would you mind explaining what a session manager is

393
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,000
and what we have now with PipeWire?

394
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,100
That's an interesting thing.

395
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,140
So if you look at PipeWire itself,

396
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,580
it's kind of like a blank canvas, basically,

397
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,320
where you can put like devices and stuff like that

398
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,880
and link them together,

399
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,080
but in itself, there's nothing there.

400
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,120
So you need to have a session manager

401
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,820
that puts things on the canvas,

402
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,400
like for example, creating all the devices

403
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,800
based on also what is detected with Udef

404
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,540
or like Bluetooth devices that appear or things like that.

405
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,700
So the session manager, it's basically like presents

406
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,440
all of the devices to PipeWire.

407
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,940
So PipeWire is basically the IPC,

408
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,540
the apps that connect to PipeWire

409
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,020
see the graph of all these devices

410
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,120
that are basically managed by the session manager.

411
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,460
So the session manager as well,

412
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,460
it looks at, for example, when a new app appears,

413
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,460
it looks, oh, what does it do?

414
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,700
What is its role?

415
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,860
And things like that.

416
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,660
And then it tries to find out where to link it to

417
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,460
and it manages the links.

418
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,640
If a device is removed, it relinks it to another device.

419
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,540
And all of that logic is done by a session manager.

420
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,480
It's Wire Plumber, right?

421
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,280
That's the name of it, pretty clever.

422
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:04,040
Yeah, we're not exactly using Wire Plumber yet.

423
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,120
It's on the to-do list for soon.

424
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,880
Currently, it's like an experimental

425
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,060
internal session manager,

426
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,520
but basically all of that code is moved

427
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,920
into a nicer code base that is Wire Plumber.

428
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,660
This has been a project a long time in the works.

429
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,800
The announcement about starting,

430
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,060
I think you made in 2017, if I recall correctly.

431
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,940
And it sounds like we're at the point where

432
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,200
if someone's willing to take a little risk,

433
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,520
they could turn this on, say if they're on Fedora 33,

434
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,420
and start using this as their sound system?

435
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:42,420
Yes, I've been running it for a while as my main desktop.

436
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,860
For today, with the mumble session I did in there too,

437
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:48,480
there was some weird bugs still.

438
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,420
But otherwise, it sort of works for regular desktop use.

439
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,920
There are some things that need fixing,

440
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,900
and we will fix them, but you can use it for basic things,

441
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,640
like watching YouTube and playing movies.

442
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,660
So exciting.

443
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,980
What is the more challenging desktop application?

444
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,900
Is it web browsers?

445
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,500
Like, what is it that is vexing you?

446
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,780
It's mostly the PulseAudio API.

447
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:14,980
So I actually need to emulate all of the PulseAudio API

448
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,560
with all of its timings and all of that thing

449
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,460
for apps to actually work well.

450
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,500
Because a lot of apps are programmed in a way I do this,

451
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,220
and then I set the time of that,

452
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,940
and it's very specific to how PulseAudio does things.

453
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,860
So I need to emulate all of that.

454
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,300
So that is currently the biggest problem.

455
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,340
Like, for example, if you look at jack apps,

456
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,340
they are much more, that's a much more simpler API,

457
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,040
and they work a lot better out of the box.

458
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,700
And so last time we spoke, I believe that was the plan,

459
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,820
is to essentially implement the jack API.

460
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,700
And so if I'm a jack user, which we are here in the studio,

461
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,140
am I in a better position?

462
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,720
It has more chance of working well, yes.

463
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,380
Like, for example, if you run Ardour or something,

464
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,460
it works fine.

465
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,140
Hey, lucky me.

466
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,020
Yeah, I actually did some testing myself

467
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,740
just a couple of days ago to see kind of where it's at.

468
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,700
And I did find a couple of bugs,

469
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,580
like Carla, when a device would disappear,

470
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,860
Carla wouldn't, you know, reflow the canvas,

471
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,480
and I'd end up having to close it and reopen it.

472
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,280
But I think that's actually a Carla bug

473
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,120
and not a PipeWire bug.

474
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,100
But that said, the jack implementation

475
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,940
is working really, really, really well.

476
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,100
You know, you do have to go into a config file

477
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,380
to change like the sampling rate or something like that.

478
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,460
But everything I threw at it really just worked

479
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,060
with the exception of Flatpak,

480
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,780
which I know is not yet supported.

481
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,940
So I'm really impressed.

482
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,980
So far, it's looking really, really good.

483
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,380
Wim, I'm kind of curious,

484
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,360
when we talk to you about this a lot,

485
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,060
we're primarily talking about Fedora

486
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,960
because we kind of know it's going to be there.

487
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,980
And Fedora has been very aggressive

488
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,080
on getting to Wayland and creating solutions

489
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,180
that work well with contained applications and whatnot,

490
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,860
which PipeWire checks all those boxes.

491
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,220
What is adoption outside of Fedora looking like right now?

492
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,540
I think it's being important in distributions.

493
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,040
Well, mainly PipeWire is used for the screen sharing.

494
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,100
So I think that's on top of Wayland,

495
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,900
that's basically the de facto standard.

496
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,220
So once the version gets updated to 3.10,

497
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,380
the audio bits are there too,

498
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,300
and you can basically use the audio bits there too.

499
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,580
So, but yes, I think everybody's watching a bit

500
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:35,020
to see how it goes in Fedora first.

501
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,940
And we can't really enable it by default yet.

502
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,180
I guess that makes sense.

503
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:42,660
But you are taking a pretty sensible approach,

504
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,120
nice and slow and steady.

505
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,340
I hope so.

506
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,180
I hope so too.

507
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,700
It's a very big undertaking too.

508
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,780
It's three APIs that need to be moved to something new.

509
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:56,260
Also, Jack and Paul saw you.

510
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,300
That's a huge undertaking.

511
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,540
I mean, you're kind of redoing in a sense

512
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,420
or reformulating how the entire media scape

513
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,540
on the Linux desktop works.

514
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,380
Yes.

515
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,220
Yeah.

516
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,620
He says with a big sigh, yeah.

517
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,220
And we're very grateful.

518
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,100
I'll tell you what I'm really looking forward to

519
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,380
is when Fedora Jam and PipeWire are both working in sync

520
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,340
and we finally have like a low latency kernel

521
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,380
available for Fedora,

522
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,380
and it becomes sort of the go-to for multimedia production.

523
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,620
That really is my dream of where I want Fedora to go.

524
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,620
Ooh, seeing the work that's going into PipeWire,

525
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,260
it feels closer than ever.

526
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,620
Thank you very much, Wim.

527
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,580
You're welcome.

528
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,660
So Wim, as a takeaway for the audience

529
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,780
that runs Linux on the desktop,

530
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,500
in a year or two, as these things stabilize

531
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,940
and adoption increases,

532
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,060
what's the primary benefit do you think end users

533
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,420
will notice?

534
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,220
Well, we will have enabled audio in a secure way in apps,

535
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,980
but that's not exactly user friendly.

536
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,980
Right, it's good for them,

537
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,020
but it's not something they-

538
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,180
Hopefully they never notice.

539
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,980
It just works like they expect.

540
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,660
So I just hope that we will be able to do new things.

541
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,780
Like for example, in GNOME,

542
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:16,500
have a panel where you can put like filters for your syncs

543
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,380
or like make more configuration panels

544
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,460
for doing stuff with your audio,

545
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,500
like what you have in core audio.

546
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,340
Oh yeah.

547
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,180
And then there's like, for example,

548
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,340
you'll be able to run Ardour,

549
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,980
which is not exactly for average users,

550
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,700
but at least you can run it and it runs out of the box,

551
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,140
like something that you actually should expect

552
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,980
from an operating system,

553
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,780
that it runs these pro apps out of the box.

554
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,860
Right, in a way it's the groundwork

555
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,980
to enable a more powerful generation

556
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,420
of production applications on Linux.

557
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,340
Yeah, and for what it's worth,

558
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,820
even some proprietary stuff,

559
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,020
like I threw Reaper at it

560
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,420
and I encountered zero bugs using Reaper with PipeWire.

561
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,260
Whoa.

562
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,420
That's good news.

563
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,300
Boy, we're looking good.

564
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,540
We may be early PipeWire adopters right here.

565
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,260
You know, I am curious though,

566
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,660
one of the big things about PipeWire

567
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,300
when we last talked to you about it, Wim,

568
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,260
was that audio and video,

569
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,460
at least in the backend, weren't too different.

570
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,620
I'm curious how video support's coming along

571
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,780
just in the current Zoom dominated world.

572
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,180
I've seen a lot of folks messing around

573
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,740
with loop back video devices

574
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,460
and getting OBS things set up,

575
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,540
all sorts of stuff that the PipeWire model

576
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,020
might make a lot easier.

577
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,020
Yeah, we're not there yet.

578
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,220
So you can capture from a camera, but that's about it.

579
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,220
There is an internal format for doing video filters,

580
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,340
but there is no example.

581
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,100
I have a Vulkan source, but that's it.

582
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,180
So, and the synchronization with audio

583
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,420
is not really worked out yet.

584
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,420
It should all be internally there,

585
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,860
but it's up in the air.

586
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,340
Still gotta tie it all together.

587
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,180
Yeah.

588
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,460
Well, we're gonna send you a beer and Red Bull

589
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,980
and you can pick which one you want

590
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,580
for until this thing's done.

591
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,740
Well, Wim, thank you for coming on and giving us an update.

592
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,140
You could tell it's a project we follow

593
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:10,980
with a lot of passion.

594
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,140
And we thought it has been too long

595
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:13,980
since we've done an update.

596
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,340
And it seems like it's relatively simple

597
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,780
in later versions of Fedora to flip on and start testing.

598
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,380
Yeah, should try it.

599
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,020
I think we might try it in our Bugathon

600
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,940
on the live stream later today.

601
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,980
Well, Wim, thank you very much for joining us.

602
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,820
Thank you.

603
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,580
Linode.com slash unplugged.

604
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,620
Go to Linode.com slash unplugged

605
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,260
and get a $100 credit for 60 days on new accounts.

606
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,700
$100 for Linode is fantastic.

607
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,500
Linode is simple cloud infrastructure with lots of options,

608
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,540
block storage, object storage,

609
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,860
and they have a really easy interface to use it

610
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,980
or plug it in with a wider orchestration system

611
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,420
like Kubernetes or Terraform,

612
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,060
which is something we've been playing with.

613
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,220
They have shared plans starting as low as $5.

614
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,100
Go for it.

615
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,860
I mean, with $100 credit, go for it.

616
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,300
They have dedicated GPU compute plans.

617
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,460
Or if you're like us and you just want

618
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,420
a decently priced system to mess around with,

619
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,380
like we did something I think middish tier

620
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,620
for the matrix server, and it's fantastic.

621
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,740
The thing runs like a champ.

622
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,340
And with 11 data centers all over the world,

623
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,740
there's probably something close to you that works.

624
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:20,660
They also have a really fast next generation network.

625
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,100
40 gigabit connections to the machines.

626
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,660
I mean, it's super fast.

627
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,940
With industry leading CPUs, a revamped cloud manager,

628
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,380
and root access to your server,

629
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,700
along with their API that is super cool

630
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,900
if you'd use nothing else

631
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,700
but the Linode command line application.

632
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,900
That's what I use on my rig.

633
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,140
And Wes, you should check this out too

634
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,260
because it's great for show notes.

635
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,980
You know how we'll sometimes use the object storage

636
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:45,700
to embed audio in our show notes for like a clip?

637
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,540
Oh yeah.

638
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,700
Well, with the Linode command line application,

639
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,820
once you get things like your account set up

640
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,660
and your API key in there,

641
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,580
you just point it at a file

642
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,780
and tell it to just upload it to the object storage

643
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,300
and flag it as public and return the URL.

644
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,620
Just all one command, it uploads the file,

645
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,300
puts it in object storage, makes it public,

646
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,300
and gives you a shareable URL

647
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,020
to embed on a website or something.

648
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,500
That sounds so easy.

649
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,340
It's super great.

650
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,580
The command line app is actually one of my favorite things

651
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,020
about Linode, although the web UI is fantastic too.

652
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,380
So linode.com slash unplugged.

653
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,940
Get a $100 credit for 60 days on a new account.

654
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,260
That's linode.com slash unplugged.

655
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,420
And a big thank you to Linode

656
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,460
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

657
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,700
So Academy 2020 is rolling on right now.

658
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,460
It runs from Friday 4th, the 4th to September 11th,

659
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:39,620
which is just a little bit after we record this episode.

660
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,700
And Alish joins us.

661
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,740
He is the president of the board of directors at KDEV

662
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,100
and the co-founder of the Linux App Summit,

663
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,340
and also a bruncher.

664
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,340
He did brunch with Brent on March 27th,

665
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,940
which I'll have a link in the show notes.

666
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,220
Alish, welcome to Unplugged.

667
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,220
Hi, thanks for having me here.

668
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,540
Hey, thanks for joining us.

669
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,700
And how's Academy going?

670
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,620
Well, it's going good.

671
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:04,620
Like everything in 2020 is a bit special, right?

672
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,340
But first, Virtual Academy, it went really well.

673
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:11,020
No big technical problems

674
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,820
that would have rendered it impossible.

675
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:17,460
I think that everyone who wanted to participate could

676
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,300
and still can.

677
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,820
We will be having sessions over the week,

678
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,500
so still ongoing.

679
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,140
So what we do is on the weekend,

680
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,220
we have talks that would be more,

681
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,540
well, what you expect from a conference kind of talks.

682
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,140
And those are done.

683
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,940
Actually, you can find them on the internet.

684
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,020
I guess that we can put the URL somewhere later

685
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,340
if somebody wants to take a look.

686
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,580
Everything is online.

687
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,420
Okay.

688
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,500
Actually, this year was easier

689
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,100
because, I mean, everything was recorded

690
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,540
because it had to reach, and it was streamed, of course.

691
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,260
Or you recorded them as you did them.

692
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,580
Yeah, we were using something called Big Blue Button,

693
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,940
which is a conferencing tool.

694
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,300
And one of the features that you have right there,

695
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,500
like you have chat, but you have a button to record

696
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,900
because, I mean, the stream is going through it, right?

697
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,420
Right, that's nice.

698
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,100
So my question with that is,

699
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,260
do you think this is a format you'll adopt long-term?

700
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,140
Because I imagine it made it possible

701
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,300
for a lot more people to attend that couldn't.

702
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,380
Or do you feel like the lower bandwidth aspect

703
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,700
isn't really long-term sustainable?

704
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,100
I think that there's definitely goods and pros

705
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,060
in making it available on the internet.

706
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,420
I'm not going to be here, the one to convince people that,

707
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:34,900
well, offering contents on the internet

708
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,900
makes them less available or something.

709
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,820
There's a big component into a conference, though,

710
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:43,420
the social component that is kind of lacking.

711
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:46,500
And I don't know if we're going to just,

712
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,580
let's always do virtual conferences

713
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,900
and forget about meeting at all, right?

714
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,260
Yeah, maybe a mix.

715
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:54,140
Yeah, hackers, we are already known

716
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,700
for being not all that sociable

717
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,300
if you remove the conferences.

718
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,380
It's your only time to get out.

719
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,380
That's my problem.

720
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,220
Exactly.

721
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,620
Yeah, but RSI is so bad

722
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,940
because I'm not going to events this year.

723
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,060
That's what I'll blame it on.

724
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,820
Well, so before Academy is even over yet,

725
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:13,580
you're already talking about the Linux App Summit,

726
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,860
and I believe the call for papers ends pretty soon,

727
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,420
so it's probably the time to get the word out.

728
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,260
Yeah, that's right.

729
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:23,260
I mean, we've been working on the LAS 2020 since last year,

730
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,020
and it will happen in November, like you said, I think.

731
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:31,220
Call for papers ends in the 1st of October.

732
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,940
This week, we're going to announce the first keynoters,

733
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,300
which are quite special, so stay tuned.

734
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,140
If you're interested in talking about applications,

735
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,540
which I think that is something

736
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,220
that is actually quite close to end users,

737
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,700
I think that it's a good forum to do it.

738
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,740
It will also be the first time that we do it online

739
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,460
and strictly virtual format.

740
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,780
Right, I've always wanted to attend.

741
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,900
You always should have.

742
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,300
I know, I know, but it always was,

743
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,140
it always conflicted with something else.

744
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,380
There's also, you have a name conflict.

745
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,900
I have LAS in mind, and people are going to think

746
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,460
I'm Chris Libre Application Summit

747
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,500
or Linux Application Summit,

748
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,820
but maybe this is the year I can make it,

749
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:11,860
so maybe I will, that's pretty great.

750
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,500
So we'll have a link if you want to submit papers

751
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,340
or if you have an idea,

752
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:17,700
and what kind of things are you looking for for the summit?

753
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,620
For one, we want to encourage all kinds of organizations

754
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,860
to create applications and contents in the end

755
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,060
that are consumable for people using Linux.

756
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,740
Actually, the concept was started by Gnome,

757
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,020
and they called it the Libre App Summit,

758
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,580
and when we started doing it together with Katie,

759
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,780
we decided to like, let's talk about Linux specifically

760
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,900
and let's do it in a way so that when organizations come,

761
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,460
they know what we're talking about exactly, right?

762
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,460
And why it's about having a free

763
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,860
and open source operating system.

764
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,940
What we want is that all of the contents

765
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,780
that people expect to have on their devices

766
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,860
are available to them.

767
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,500
And we don't want, well, technical reasons

768
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,020
or communication reasons to be why these aren't happening.

769
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,580
So we invite the different organizations

770
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,780
to reach out to us and hear from the people

771
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,220
who have been developing the operating system.

772
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,540
I think that was a nice transition

773
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,420
when it moved from something that was for the Gnome folks

774
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,100
to something that's for Linux users,

775
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:21,780
Plasma Desktop, Gnome Desktop, i3, whatever it might be.

776
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,940
We want applications for Linux,

777
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,940
and I think that's a good focus.

778
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,220
In the broader case, does that mean more standards?

779
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,980
Does that mean coming together and deciding to do things

780
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,300
as a desktop standard?

781
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,500
Or what do you think ultimately will be action

782
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,660
from something like this?

783
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,940
Well, in general, to find what solution

784
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,380
you need for a problem, you need to get people together

785
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,500
and agree, right?

786
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,580
Right, right, absolutely.

787
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,940
That's why we needed a space

788
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,540
where to have this kind of conversation.

789
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,340
And it's definitely part of that.

790
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,260
Something also that is kind of related,

791
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,660
but not exactly like we were talking

792
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,860
about developers talking, but on LAS,

793
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,820
we also believe that you need to have

794
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,740
a lot different kind of profiles

795
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,700
to approach the Linux community

796
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,340
that goes beyond just the hackers themselves.

797
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,860
And we want to find ways to make sure

798
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,260
that they find the space to collaborate

799
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,740
on the different projects.

800
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,580
And we want to, if you look at the different topics

801
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,620
that we're suggesting people to talk about,

802
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,660
you will see things like legal or promotion.

803
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,980
People need to be able to know

804
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,940
how these are gonna work on Linux on the long run.

805
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,660
Besides, well, the APIs that people are using,

806
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,740
which in the end, I mean, if you're a developer,

807
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,820
you will be able to find the APIs

808
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,940
that you need to use somewhere on the internet, right?

809
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,500
But is all of the content really available

810
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,660
for people to consume?

811
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:45,100
Well, let's make sure it is.

812
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,660
And that's what LAS is all about.

813
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,140
I think it's a great idea from the concept

814
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:53,660
of a place to send developers who are Linux curious

815
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,300
and they don't have all the answers.

816
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,300
They don't even know maybe where to look

817
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,420
or what the language is to speak.

818
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,260
And this is something they could attend

819
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,940
and get a pretty good sense of the lay of the ground

820
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,900
and maybe get an idea of how to start developing for Linux.

821
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,740
Yes, for sure.

822
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,220
That's a good way to come from.

823
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,180
Also, if you're coming from a region

824
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,740
that is not very represented on the different communities,

825
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,940
it's a good way to get introduced into the whole concept.

826
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,020
Most free software communities that I know about

827
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,660
are very Western world kind of centric.

828
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,060
And it's something that I think that LAS also

829
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:35,020
can help a bit to solve by not targeting everyone

830
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,980
into a solution, which myself as a KD person,

831
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,020
I would be happy with getting everything implemented,

832
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,500
but just having this common space

833
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,540
where people can approach and see

834
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,540
how can we bring the Linux things you're creating

835
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,660
into my language, into my locales.

836
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,700
The world is much more complex

837
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,260
than many of us think sometimes.

838
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,740
There's lots of scripts.

839
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,700
There's lots of different perspectives

840
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,380
that we need to make sure that are taken care of.

841
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:06,420
And we need to have places that they need to feel like

842
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,860
they're not excluding anyone, they just want solutions.

843
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,220
And we are offering a space for there on LAS.

844
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,100
Absolutely.

845
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,500
Well, let's keep up the great work.

846
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,220
Thank you for updating us

847
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,020
when you're in the middle of conferences

848
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,860
and doing all of that.

849
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,140
Don't work yourself too hard.

850
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,100
And here's to a successful Linux app summit.

851
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,220
Oh, thank you very much.

852
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,580
Thanks for joining us.

853
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,100
We'll also, if you wanted to catch the platform,

854
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,260
it's big blue button, we'll have a link to that as well

855
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,100
in the show notes.

856
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,180
Those are at linuxunplug.com slash three seven zero.

857
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,100
We'll have a link to the stuff we talked about

858
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,580
as well as the call for papers.

859
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,460
And now it is time

860
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,420
for a spot of housekeeping.

861
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,620
Long overdue.

862
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,820
You know, it's been getting a little dirty, Wes.

863
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,140
You know, you didn't show up so I didn't bother cleaning

864
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,180
cause you're doing it remote today.

865
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,820
So I thought, oh, I can just let it go.

866
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,260
No, no, housekeeping must go on.

867
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,100
You're right.

868
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,940
It is my fault.

869
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,220
I was trying to make it your fault,

870
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,300
but I just couldn't, I couldn't work the angle.

871
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,140
Now listen here, it's important.

872
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,020
This is important.

873
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,220
We're moving the recording schedule

874
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,260
for one week next week.

875
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,260
We're going on Sunday, this Sunday coming up, big change.

876
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,620
I don't know why I'm saying it weird.

877
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,900
What I'm trying to say is Sunday the 13th,

878
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,900
we're pre-recording for the episode

879
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,180
that would normally be live on the 15th.

880
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,540
I'm taking that week off, trying to do a little downtime,

881
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,700
trying not to do the old burnout thing.

882
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,780
And so we're going to record on Sunday

883
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,260
around 3 p.m. Pacific, which that means 6 p.m. Eastern.

884
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,660
We'd love to have you there.

885
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,420
Show up, hang out in the lup lug at noon

886
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,460
and then just stretch that thing out.

887
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,580
Now tonight as we record,

888
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,340
we're doing the Bugathon for Fedora 33.

889
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,300
We want to explore this idea further

890
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,100
and maybe see if we can't take it to future projects.

891
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,940
I don't know.

892
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,780
We'll probably talk about it tonight actually,

893
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:51,100
but I'd like to call on the community in the meantime

894
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,940
to keep joining the Bugathon room on our matrix server.

895
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,300
I want to make a persistent space

896
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,380
where developers can reach out to willing and able testers

897
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,220
in the Bugathon room.

898
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,660
Essentially a spot where they can search for it.

899
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,500
It's a beautiful thing in matrix and they can find it

900
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,860
and they can go in there and boom,

901
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,420
a group of people willing to help them test something.

902
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,420
Imagine just even that as a resource for developers

903
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:14,660
where they can reach users

904
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,860
when they need another set of eyes.

905
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,540
Also taking future projects

906
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,980
that we could do as a Bugathon in that room.

907
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,380
So that'll be the place to stay up to date

908
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,220
on future developments.

909
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,540
We'd love to hear from open source project leaders

910
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,780
or developers who have any ideas

911
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,460
on how we could utilize this community powered

912
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,260
bug testing better.

913
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,060
All of that, you can either email me,

914
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,240
chris at jupyterbroadcasting.com

915
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,960
or join the Bugathon room on our matrix server

916
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,280
and chat with us about it in there

917
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,940
because I think this is something,

918
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,180
I've got a lot of big ideas,

919
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,420
but I want to do it the right way.

920
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,640
Measure twice, cut once

921
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,180
and do something that truly makes a difference.

922
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,060
And I think I'll also just plug while we're wrapping it up,

923
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,700
Wes joined us on Coder Radio this week.

924
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,740
So check out Coder Radio,

925
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,300
they'll be releasing just like a day or so

926
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,180
after we publish this episode.

927
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,540
Yeah, that was a lot of fun.

928
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,180
Yeah, thanks for doing that.

929
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,140
That's what Wes spent his Labor Day doing.

930
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,780
It was podcasting.

931
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,860
I can't think of anything better than debating the merits

932
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,700
of C++ with you and Mike.

933
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,780
That's exactly what we did.

934
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,180
So check out coder.show for that.

935
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,840
Thank you to our unplugged core contributors

936
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,380
who are making these shows possible really.

937
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,460
This is our core.

938
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,980
This is the foundation of the show

939
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,540
that makes it possible to continue production

940
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,340
if we lose sponsorships

941
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,920
or help us offset the need for sponsors.

942
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,420
And it keeps us independent.

943
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,540
So I really want to say thank you to the core contributors,

944
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,620
unpluggedcore.com if you're interested in signing up.

945
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,220
You get access to two feeds.

946
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,780
Feed one is the ad-free

947
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,580
or maybe more appropriate, limited ad-free feed

948
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,460
because there are some ads that are short

949
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,260
but contractually obligated to be in there.

950
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,900
But there's otherwise, it's the fully produced show,

951
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,460
fully mixed and just less ads.

952
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,580
We cut what we can.

953
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,100
Yeah, and you get the clean audio.

954
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,220
So if we have somebody on,

955
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,100
Drew works on spicing that stuff up and making it sweet,

956
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,020
that's all in there.

957
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,020
But if you'd rather have just the bootleg copy

958
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,740
of the entire stream, which is often much longer

959
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,860
and has lots of interesting conversations

960
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,860
that are a little more of the off-air variety,

961
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,660
that's feed two, the full live stream.

962
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,500
All our screw-ups,

963
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,580
the stuff that never really makes it into the show,

964
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,820
that's all in that feed.

965
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,640
So you get feed one or feed two,

966
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,900
and that's available when you become

967
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:30,380
a unplugged core contributor as a thank you.

968
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,160
And that's at unpluggedcore.com.

969
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,840
The real question is, do you want the Drew magic

970
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,580
or do you want all the mess-ups?

971
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:41,420
Yeah, you know, or do the AB thing,

972
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,300
which it would actually be a really,

973
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,740
I think it would help people appreciate

974
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,200
the work that goes into it,

975
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,260
is subscribe, get the live version feed,

976
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,740
and then compare it to the version published on the website.

977
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,400
And I think you'll see quite the difference.

978
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,260
Also still taking input for Linux Prepper,

979
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,260
I should mention that too.

980
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,060
But I wanted to get into our feedback

981
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,580
because we've gotten some good ones recently

982
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,820
and we wanted to get through at least a batch of these

983
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,020
and then maybe hold another batch

984
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,460
so we can also do picks.

985
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,920
Let's start with a mention with a community book club.

986
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,780
Yes, a community book club.

987
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,380
The group will do a read of Jono Bacon's people-powered book

988
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,960
with a discussion on Slack

989
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,700
and a weekly QA session with Jono.

990
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,520
The book club, which takes place entirely online,

991
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,700
is free and will run from October 6th to December 15th.

992
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,060
So you do the math on that.

993
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,180
Q&A calls every Tuesday at 9 a.m. Pacific time.

994
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,460
Wow, that's quite the day.

995
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,860
You do your book club Q&A,

996
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,760
then you do your unplugged live.

997
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,500
Sign-ups are open until October 2nd

998
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,980
and further information like the Slack group and stuff

999
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,580
will be emailed to participants closer

1000
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,820
to when the Q&A starts.

1001
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,180
But if you're interested in community

1002
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,700
and making your existing community better,

1003
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,420
Jono's kind of become the source on this stuff.

1004
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,580
So I'll have a link to that in the show notes.

1005
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,860
And I guess it's a freebie way to listen to the book, right?

1006
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,940
Yeah, and I mean like talk to folks

1007
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,980
that are interested in other people

1008
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:58,860
working at building and maintaining communities.

1009
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,300
Sounds like a good resource.

1010
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,140
Yeah, and troll Jono.

1011
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,140
So that's totally worth it, really, if you think about it.

1012
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,380
Well, that's why you'll be there.

1013
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,540
All right, our first email comes in from Jake,

1014
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,820
and he says, hey guys,

1015
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,740
congratulations on becoming independent again.

1016
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:14,420
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

1017
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,620
He says, I was curious if you've ever considered

1018
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:19,260
trying Alpine on the garage server.

1019
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,260
It has Docker and ZFS availability natively.

1020
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,580
And he says, thanks for hanging through

1021
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,860
what must have been some trying times, Jake.

1022
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:28,500
Jake says we should use Alpine.

1023
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,780
What do you think of that?

1024
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,300
Ooh, you know, I didn't realize

1025
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,540
that it had ZFS easily available.

1026
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,340
That's never a bad thing, is it?

1027
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,340
I didn't realize that either.

1028
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,580
Now, that would be taking things

1029
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,340
to the next minimal level, I think.

1030
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,580
Certainly, we've used tons of containers powered by Alpine.

1031
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,740
As a full-fledged server, I don't know,

1032
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,220
maybe it's worth a shot.

1033
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,740
Well, it doesn't have that same kind of,

1034
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,820
doing 85 on a motorcycle down the freeway

1035
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,460
with no helmet on kind of feel that our Arch server does.

1036
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,940
Right, well, and the other thing too is,

1037
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,340
using Arch, you gotta piece it together.

1038
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,500
But we often fall back on that there Arch Wiki,

1039
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,860
which is a huge resource.

1040
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,380
I could see it though.

1041
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,380
Especially for something like a Raspberry Pi

1042
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:11,660
or a really low-end NUC that is just an appliance,

1043
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,100
that could be the OS to go with.

1044
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,180
I could definitely see it making sense.

1045
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,500
Daniel writes in with questions about remote office.

1046
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,660
He says, sorry in advance for being a noob.

1047
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,620
On one of your shows, you talked about

1048
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:26,300
how you linked your RV to the studio's office network.

1049
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,020
I have looked for more info on this

1050
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,820
and I'm hitting a brick wall.

1051
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,180
I have satellite internet at both my office and home

1052
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,180
and I'd like to get SSH access to my work computer

1053
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,060
and access some shared drives.

1054
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,540
Both my desktop and my laptop run Pop OS

1055
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,260
and I've never looked back.

1056
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,420
Without going any longer into my background,

1057
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,420
this is all to say I have a pretty good understanding

1058
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,020
of basic programming and networking

1059
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,180
from about the mid-90s, but I've been a little out of touch.

1060
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,940
So my question is, if I have a droplet

1061
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,780
that's running a mail server,

1062
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,500
could I use that for this project?

1063
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,300
I know I haven't given you a lot of information,

1064
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,940
but maybe you guys can help.

1065
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,660
Well, Wes, I think he's just about onto it.

1066
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,860
I think you just need to connect the dots

1067
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,100
for Daniel on this one.

1068
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,940
Yeah, right?

1069
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:06,780
I mean, we're doing a couple of things.

1070
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,540
Probably primarily would be leveraging WireGuard,

1071
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:12,980
which is just sort of our own VPN of choice these days.

1072
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:15,260
And then also something you and Alex talked about

1073
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:19,060
in self-hosted episode 24 would be that handy little

1074
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:22,380
remote forwarding SSH where you forward the SSH port

1075
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,740
from one of your pies in your mobile RV

1076
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,420
up to a droplet that we've got running

1077
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,580
and then you can access that from anywhere.

1078
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,660
That's really the trick.

1079
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,700
And I love it so much that now I've set it up

1080
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,420
on my son's computer, I just put on everything now

1081
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,420
and I just have it right there as another port

1082
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,740
and I just change ports and one port number

1083
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,060
equals this machine in my head,

1084
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,060
one port number equals my other machine in my head

1085
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,940
and it works so well that I use it on the regular for SSH.

1086
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,860
Now, WireGuard ultimately would be the simpler solution

1087
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,020
if that would work with your satellite internet provider

1088
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,660
because then you could talk to the machine

1089
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,980
with just with anything, like if you wanted to do SFTP

1090
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,460
or if you wanted to do Samba,

1091
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,060
you could do any kind of file transfer.

1092
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,780
So WireGuard might be the preferred solution

1093
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,700
but you could totally do it with SSH jump hosts.

1094
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,660
Yeah, and if it wasn't clear, that's what we're doing here.

1095
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,380
I would definitely argue

1096
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,500
for a virtual private network myself.

1097
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,980
I mean, that's what they're for.

1098
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,140
Yeah, that'll give you full,

1099
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,140
it's like you've actually joined the networks together,

1100
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,540
you're on the same network.

1101
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,420
The SSH thing is really just sort of

1102
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,380
an convenient little hack when all you need

1103
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,700
is remote SSH access and you've already got

1104
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,540
a public VPS somewhere.

1105
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,540
I mean, you could also do a little port forwarding.

1106
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,820
You could do some things.

1107
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,020
But yeah, WireGuard really would be the way to go.

1108
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,220
Check the show notes too,

1109
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,180
Wes is dropping in a link to a secure SSH tunnel

1110
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,580
as a system D unit, which the trick there

1111
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,940
is when your system comes up,

1112
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,420
it just automatically establishes that tunnel for you

1113
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,020
on the back end and leaves it persistently connected.

1114
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,900
And if your network goes out,

1115
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,060
it can also help reconnect that automatically

1116
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,260
without you having to do anything.

1117
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,980
So Daniel, when you're looking for

1118
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,980
that remote office solution,

1119
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,780
do check out that link Wes just dropped in there.

1120
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,260
Yeah, it's also pretty handy for remote support.

1121
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,420
Maybe you don't need to establish a full VPN tunnel,

1122
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,700
but you've got a family member whose laptop's running Linux

1123
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,500
and you need, occasionally you gotta jump in there

1124
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:08,780
to do some troubleshooting.

1125
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,020
That's a handy way to do it too.

1126
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,740
Yeah, I think it was just a month or five ago that,

1127
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,420
oh yeah, it was a little bit ago.

1128
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,620
But my son was preparing for school from home

1129
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:23,180
and he needed a dependency to install some app they use,

1130
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,660
it might've even been Zoom.

1131
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,060
And I just didn't really feel like walking him

1132
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,060
through the process of app installing

1133
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,820
when his mom's standing there over the computer,

1134
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,540
they want it done, the teacher's waiting.

1135
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:37,220
I just fired off the SSH connection through that tunnel,

1136
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,780
jumped on his box, pseudo-app installed the package,

1137
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,060
got it all going for him in seconds

1138
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,420
and they were able to just launch the app.

1139
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,980
It was really a quick resolution.

1140
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,980
And that's just a high level of support

1141
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,860
you could offer with Linux if you use the tools.

1142
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,060
Like it doesn't have remote desktop RDP,

1143
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,660
I couldn't RDP into it,

1144
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,620
but I sure solved the problem awful quick.

1145
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,460
All right, well thank you

1146
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,460
for going to linuxunplug.com slash contact

1147
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,420
and sending those in.

1148
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,500
We have a couple of more for next episode

1149
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,140
since we're doing a prerecord, we're saving a couple.

1150
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,420
So if you didn't hear yours answered, stay tuned,

1151
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,740
but you do get a taco either way.

1152
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:08,020
All right, why don't we do a few picks before we go?

1153
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,740
Because everyone needs this first pick.

1154
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,740
And I think it's kind of a essential service

1155
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,620
to the community that we call this one out

1156
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,100
because I know this is what you've been waiting for,

1157
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,380
a spreadsheet program that's end curses.

1158
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:24,060
Yeah, right, who doesn't want that?

1159
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,340
Tired of loading up a bloated GUI all the time,

1160
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,780
you just need to calculate a few rows here and there?

1161
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:32,780
No longer, at least with SCIM.

1162
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,780
You really got a good pitch down for that.

1163
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:36,180
They should contact you.

1164
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,820
Tired of those bloated graphical spreadsheet programs?

1165
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,220
Go back to the days of Lotus.

1166
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,060
Well, I mean, you know,

1167
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,100
a spreadsheet's just like a 2D interface anyway.

1168
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:47,940
For sure.

1169
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:49,700
A bunch of columns of text and numbers.

1170
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,860
That's kind of perfect.

1171
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:53,540
And don't we always love a good end curses pick?

1172
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,500
Yes, always.

1173
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,260
We should have an end curses jingle, actually.

1174
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:57,260
We love it so much.

1175
00:44:57,260 --> 00:44:59,060
Now you might laugh, but you should stay around.

1176
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,460
Check this pick out just enough

1177
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,940
to see their charting support

1178
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,020
because that kind of blew me away.

1179
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,420
Oh, you're right.

1180
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,460
That's legitimately rad.

1181
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,180
All right, well, you'll have to check the link

1182
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,260
in the show notes to see that one

1183
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,220
because while we're talking about things

1184
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,020
that you always are going to want to do

1185
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,060
on the command line, obviously,

1186
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,340
that would be presentations, of course.

1187
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,260
You want to present on the command line.

1188
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,620
And that's where this next pick comes in.

1189
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:27,700
It's simply called present.

1190
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:31,420
And well, I mean, it supports as schematics.

1191
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,980
So you could have some animations, I think.

1192
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,580
Yeah, I mean, it's got colors.

1193
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,660
It's got effects.

1194
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:38,340
It's honestly one of the best.

1195
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,900
I've been looking around for a quote unquote full feature

1196
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,860
at least as far as you can get presentation tool

1197
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,020
for the command line.

1198
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,420
You know, sometimes you got to demo stuff.

1199
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,260
You're making some changes.

1200
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:49,220
You got a new project you're trying to show off.

1201
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:50,180
If you're going to be doing that stuff

1202
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,300
on the terminal anyway,

1203
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,100
why have to switch back and forth between like,

1204
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,860
you know, whatever you're using Google services,

1205
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,340
or maybe you've got the LibreOffice presentation suite

1206
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,300
installed.

1207
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,300
Nah, none of that.

1208
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,380
This is just a simple Python app pip install present

1209
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,580
and away you go.

1210
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,420
You know what, Wes?

1211
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:09,460
It is no less ridiculous than all of your core applications

1212
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,060
being different tabs in a web browser.

1213
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,060
No, exactly.

1214
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,740
And I mean, it's powered by Markdown, right?

1215
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,340
So if you're already familiar with writing stuff

1216
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,900
in Markdown, that's kind of how I plan out my notes

1217
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,100
for presentations anyway.

1218
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,420
And if I can just leverage that without having to copy that

1219
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,820
and reformat it, drag boxes around in a GUI

1220
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,900
and just have a basic presentation,

1221
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,340
no, it won't work for everything.

1222
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,940
But for just simple internal facing presentations

1223
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,260
with a bunch of other nerds,

1224
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,980
I think it might actually be useful.

1225
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,140
So everyone on the Zoom call, I am using Wayland.

1226
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:37,540
So I can't share my screen.

1227
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:41,380
So please SSH in and join my team up session.

1228
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,940
And we will look at this presentation together.

1229
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,260
There's only one organization I think that would fly in

1230
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,580
and it would be JB.

1231
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,700
That would be the only place we'd be like,

1232
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,460
oh yeah, cool, no problem.

1233
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,300
That's really neat.

1234
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,940
How are you doing that?

1235
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:55,460
Am I dating us, Brent, by talking about Lotus?

1236
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,420
You know, the good old days?

1237
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,260
Yeah, I think a little bit, but many of us,

1238
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,340
well, I say that.

1239
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:00,700
I'm just trying to make myself feel better.

1240
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,940
One of the first, first applications I ever used

1241
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,140
was a spreadsheet program on the fan line

1242
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:06,620
with Commodore 64 stuff.

1243
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:10,140
My father tracked our allowance when we were kids in there

1244
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,940
and we had to use it otherwise we didn't get it.

1245
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,260
So that was quite nostalgic.

1246
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,900
Wow, tracked the, you know,

1247
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,380
I kind of remember something similar back in the day

1248
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,740
as my dad tracked the family finances

1249
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,420
in a DOS-based spreadsheet.

1250
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:26,900
It just, it all looked like wizardry to me.

1251
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,180
See you next week.

1252
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,860
Same bat time, same bat station.

1253
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:31,900
Well, this would normally be the point

1254
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,400
where I'd plug the live stream next week,

1255
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,260
but I'm heading off into the woods or maybe the coast.

1256
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:37,260
I'm not sure yet.

1257
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:38,260
Taking a little downtime.

1258
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,860
So we're pre-recording, like I mentioned,

1259
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,440
on this coming Sunday.

1260
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,300
But if you're subscribed, like 98%, 99% of you that listen,

1261
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,940
almost making it not even worth me mentioning right now,

1262
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:50,220
nothing will really change for you.

1263
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,460
It's pretty much gonna be the same.

1264
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,540
So linuxunplug.com slash 370 to go get more of that.

1265
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,020
Thank you to Drew and Wes

1266
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,560
and thank you to the Mumble Room.

1267
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,380
Thank you to Elish and Wim for joining us as well.

1268
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,140
And thank you to our core contributors

1269
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,820
who are helping make the show possible.

1270
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,460
And thanks to all of you for listening.

1271
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:11,460
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1272
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:38,560
fait.

1273
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:57,220
I wanted to get the Virtual Lugs take on a blog post over at HawaiiGentech.com about

1274
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:02,460
why I, this is the author, why I linked to the Wayback Machine instead of the original

1275
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,460
site.

1276
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:06,820
They write, when linking to a page for the purposes of reference, like we do in the show

1277
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:11,500
notes all the time, it seems better to me to link to an archive version of a given page

1278
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,120
rather than to the original site itself.

1279
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:18,780
This ensures that after some years have gone by, my article is guaranteed to be consistent.

1280
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,100
Due to the changing nature of the web, there is a chance that after some years, the link

1281
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:27,040
could lead to a 404 not found, changed or edited content or entirely replaced, content

1282
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,020
that has been due to a rise in popularity is now shielded behind a paywall demanding

1283
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:33,900
a user account or even pay for it.

1284
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:38,300
Whereas linking to the archive is probably more authoritative than linking to dynamic,

1285
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,460
changeable web content.

1286
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:46,540
And then the author sites where some new sites on all sides have made changes after the fact

1287
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:50,820
with no notice of updates or anything and then it made their article irrelevant they're

1288
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,280
referencing to.

1289
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:58,840
And archive.org is a great way to just kind of link to an official always will work version

1290
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,740
of a website.

1291
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:02,180
Think about it in the context of our podcast.

1292
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:09,800
So instead of linking to Foronix or OMG Ubuntu or LWN, we would link to archive.org's Wayback

1293
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,740
Machine version of their thing.

1294
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:16,940
I've used Wayback Machine a couple of times, but it doesn't capture all dates, right?

1295
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,780
Can you manually trigger to capture a website?

1296
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:24,360
Yeah, I think there is a way to submit something to the Wayback Machine and it grabs a capture

1297
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,360
of it that day.

1298
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:26,360
Okay.

1299
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,360
Yeah, that Yeah, right.

1300
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:32,740
I would agree with you that linking to a Wayback link indeed is more secure.

1301
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:42,460
I've had oftentimes I remember now for school we were using an API framework called loopback

1302
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:48,220
and we had to push it to IBM cloud and they also use that from documentation on a different

1303
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:49,220
website.

1304
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:52,900
And when you were Googling for instructions or something was going wrong and you were

1305
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,260
Googling for stuff to help you out, it would link it to a forum.

1306
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,820
And when you click on that forum, they were mentioning, oh, this is the old link.

1307
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:04,660
We've moved to this forum, but all the old posts were archived.

1308
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:10,660
They no longer exist on the new forum and having a Wayback Machine link would have been

1309
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:11,660
handier in that case.

1310
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:14,020
Yeah, I'm a big fan of the Wayback Machine.

1311
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,340
I mean, it's been around forever.

1312
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:19,460
But in my experience, every time I go to use it, there's, you know, there's some text there

1313
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,220
and some basic images and stuff.

1314
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:24,420
I remember looking at one of Popeys old websites with cats on it.

1315
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:27,660
A lot of the usability kind of goes away.

1316
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:32,060
There's some fancy features in, you know, modern web that don't always translate it.

1317
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:37,020
I think maybe that would be a bad user experience in some cases when, you know, some websites

1318
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,900
were looking to have some pretty neat stuff going on.

1319
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,980
I just wanted you to know that I did catch that you're using the Wayback Machine to look

1320
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,980
at Popeys cats.

1321
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:44,980
I did catch that.

1322
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:45,980
All right.

1323
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:46,980
All right.

1324
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:59,980
That's all.
