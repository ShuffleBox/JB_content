1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
You know, I mean right now where do they tell you not where do they tell you not to use it?

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,140
Because this is kde.org's announcement and maybe they do say somewhere in here. I haven't read the entire thing

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:14,060
It says kde ships plasma 5.0 and so it might it might say don't use it yet

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,680
I don't know but I mean in here

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,120
It's not really looking like it looks like it's trying to market itself to new users

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:23,780
It does talk about having Wayland technology previews, but that's okay. That's a given

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:30,020
They said that they until they say it's ready to use it for to put be prepared production

8
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:34,020
They have inherently not saying that it is they don't have to every time they make a release

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,980
This is not ready. Like for example, I mean gnome was garbage until 3.6. I

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,780
Would argue 312 but okay, maybe 310

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,260
Well, I mean garbage like fundamentally not workable not usable like three six where it became where you could actually use it

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,780
Yeah, I mean, but okay

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:58,260
Do you see but do you see what I'm saying how what you're what you're saying essentially calls for a tribal knowledge of?

14
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:06,060
How this works like yeah, they're not clear about their their kde is not being clear about what is what is usable and what?

15
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,260
Is not that's true

16
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,060
But that's pretty much all de's and you could like you could say well

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,020
Kde also has a lot of other problems in the fact that their their website looks like it was made ten years ago

18
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,780
By the same time they have other websites that are like sub projects that look nice like plasma mobile looks nice

19
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,980
But they have their main one looks like crap

20
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,980
So like they have a lot of things that they need to work on

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,700
But they're not they until they say that it actually is ready to go for like just production

22
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:39,340
You know releases then that's why for is still the stable and that's why they still suggest it

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,860
It's just not

24
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:47,460
Like if for example, I would love to have I just whatever I I mean that is

25
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,420
So, okay, so let's let's take everything you've just said and I will grant you all of it is 100% true

26
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,860
And so now if you grant me that like most new people or let's not even say new people

27
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,340
I would say casual linux users and new linux users people who don't closely follow linux news and things like that

28
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,060
I don't think it's unreasonable for them to think that something called kde plasma

29
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,540
5.4 with a very nice release announcement and press coverage around it

30
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:18,780
I don't think it's unreasonable for them to think that's production ready 5.4 version 5.4 of something. I

31
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,420
agree

32
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,420
Well, yeah, it's not properly

33
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,420
Announced sure, but there's like for example Katie kabuntu released

34
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:35,740
1504 with 5.2 which was completely unstable and a garbage decision and I know why they did it because they were trying to get like

35
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,420
Some testing in and there yeah, so they can gradually go to five three and then gradually go to five four

36
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,660
It's like yeah, I get why they did it

37
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:48,740
But it was still a garbage decision because people who moved it was like, oh kabuntu's got this new KDE and like and it's crap

38
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,420
So and so people when I when someone suggests I want to use

39
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,280
KDE on Ubuntu the current solution is either 1404 or don't touch kabuntu

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,940
So is anyone in here using plasma 5 desktop?

41
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:08,020
I'm using it right now. I have two drives in my 17-inch laptop. I

42
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:14,820
Have the Wiley wolf alpha 2 and that's you and that's using plasma

43
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,940
5.3.95 pretty current which yeah

44
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:24,380
It's like I just I just saw that 5.4 got announced today

45
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:30,400
I'm like, well, I might swap the hard drives and just see if there's a back port for kabuntu

46
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
15 no

47
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,400
1504 which I'm running on the other drive

48
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,420
even

49
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:43,680
Plasma 5.3 point you I still you're so I'm like I've had less crash issues on

50
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,680
5.3.95 then on

51
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,040
3.2

52
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,040
3.2 still crashes on plasma 5 on whatever

53
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,200
I haven't had any issue with the audio app and I'm wondering if their new audio app is causing the problem for you Chris

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,900
You know what? I would I would not be surprised if my audio applet didn't install

55
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,960
Simply because it you know

56
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,500
I am in the middle I installed last night and maybe that's one of the few packages that has

57
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,400
Transitioned to the K to plasma 5 for and because I'm not installing the rest of the packages. I didn't get it

58
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,840
But so ww as a fairly consistent plasma 5 desktop user

59
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:27,280
It is my characterization of its stability consistent with your use cases with the versions previous to version 5 for and it's RC's

60
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:35,880
Yeah, like even rotten's correct. I'm like 5.2 because like I I've been like I was on like

61
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,360
1404 then I went to 1410 and I was pretty happy with the plasma for it was working great

62
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,600
You know, I didn't really have an issue and then like plasma 5 came out. I'm like that looks really good

63
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,040
I want to try that and it was just like shut down script issues and

64
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,440
It was just I could totally tell a difference between system D and the system in it

65
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,760
that they had previously even between like 1510 and or no 1504 to 1410 and

66
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,320
That was a pretty big difference for me. And then I'm

67
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:20,840
Just like plasma. It's been crashing consistently since five. It's slowly been getting better. So maybe

68
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:28,880
Maybe by the next release it will get better. But um, I really don't know. We still have like two months to go, right?

69
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:36,140
But this is this is what that happened last time like with three to four the same thing happened for the first few versions

70
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,680
It was a beta of release and people were not told it was beta

71
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,120
But in the version 5 they were told it was beta. I mean, I said yes, I specifically remember that transition

72
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,440
I was a KD user at that time and I remember it not being quite this bad for this long

73
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,680
I remember essentially what had happened was it was pretty unstable and then it became more

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,280
Functionality and refinement features after release after release after release. It wasn't we're seeing some of that

75
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,360
But I mean, I'm talking fundamental instabilities and I maybe you can blame the Nvidia driver the proprietary Nvidia driver

76
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,680
Darn it, maybe you can blame something else. That's not you know, the plasma desktop, but I

77
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,140
Remember that transition because I lived that transition and I do not remember being this bumpy

78
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,400
First of all, they're also doing a lot more than this time because they they were just adding features from three to four

79
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,060
Yeah, they weren't fundamentally rewriting pretty much everything and changing the way it's structured. And yeah

80
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,160
So there is a lot more for them to do

81
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:40,160
Yeah, essentially like 80% of the entire project is replayed as being like rebuilt. Well, right, you know, it's funny is in some sense

82
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,480
When no made the transition from gnome 2 to gnome 3 it was obvious. That was such a huge change

83
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,600
It was like they just threw out everything it looked different

84
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,740
It was everything was different

85
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,020
But when when when they went from from the plasma 4 desktop to the plasma 5 desktop

86
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,200
They actually took a lot of work to make sure it looked and functioned very similar

87
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:07,120
And so the amount of revolutionary change behind the scenes I think is lost a little bit on the average user because so much

88
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,600
functions and looks the same on

89
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Purpose, do you agree?

90
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:20,640
Um, I think it's confusing for people because there are certain things that are very similar and they look the same especially like the worst

91
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,140
part is that when people use for like

92
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,220
Qt4 kt4 apps inside of qt5 and kte5 or plasma 5 and they look the same

93
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,860
They're like they like but they but they they're wrapped inside the new win interface

94
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:40,900
I think that's a negative thing because it makes people think that those are like five version apps when they're just actually

95
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,700
Yes, potentially really old apps. I agree. Yes, I agree. That is also kind of confusing

96
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:51,060
So there's there's kte5, you know plasma 5 and framework 5

97
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,500
They're doing a lot of cool things and I can't wait for them to actually get it where the point where it is stable

98
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,580
But right now it's still not like it's I mean, I haven't tried 5.4 yet, but

99
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:05,540
They haven't announced that it's ready to go. So I would assume that it's not

100
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,180
Yeah, I'm pretty much using I'm pretty much using

101
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:18,660
Both versions like 1504 and 1510 alpha 2 on my system

102
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,740
Just like as testing. I'm not full. I'm like using it for like web browsing

103
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,700
Trying out steam games and you know, just seeing how it reacts and how it works

104
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,980
And if I encounter something hopefully I can do a report, you know, that's what I kind of

105
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,660
Trying to keep in the mind. That's really cool data. That's really cool

106
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,500
You know that good for you and you know

107
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,700
One of the things that jumped out at me is their language they used in the release announcement for plasma 5.4

108
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,260
The new volume control applet directly manages pulse audio

109
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:56,020
It says and I thought that was particularly interesting that set off some ding-ding-dings in my brain and I'm thinking

110
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:01,140
Hmm, maybe it's time to try it again on a studio machine because I believe if you recall my main issues was it felt

111
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,900
Like that phonon layer there was particularly interfering between when I would hook up. I like a like a

112
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,100
Audio out to the line out on say the bonobo

113
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:17,140
KDE would still only send the audio to my hdmi out regardless of what I'd set in the in the audio out settings

114
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,100
and I always kind of felt like maybe there was like a miscommunication between

115
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,820
Phone on and pulse audio because if I opened a poof control or poof a controller, whatever you call it

116
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,500
I I could go manually set it still and then it would work fine

117
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,660
But I just couldn't use any of the built-in KDE tools and so when they say in that release announcement that

118
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,220
In fact, I still have it open right here

119
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,060
I'll read it to you because I when I read that I was like, oh what are you I almost felt like they were like

120
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:45,460
Talking to me here. Here's what they say a new audio volume applet our new audio volume applet works directly with pulse audio

121
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,540
the popular sound server for linux

122
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,500
To give you full control over volume and output settings in beautifully designed simple interface

123
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,980
And I don't know if it's called super simple

124
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,620
But one of the things that jumped out at me is right there in the audio settings. Look at that a volume slider

125
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,980
a volume slider

126
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,220
Took him uh took him a few releases, but we finally got it. I'm happy. I'm a happy boy

127
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,020
This is linux unplugged episode 107 for august 25th

128
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,020
2015

129
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,300
Welcome to linux unplugged your weekly linux talk show that you know now that I think about it

130
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:37,220
I wish all of our gadgets just ran off of dc power. My name is chris. We got a good show for you today episode

131
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,860
107 not only do I have something that i'm extremely excited to share with you guys that

132
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,340
Only the really linux unplugged crew gets to know about right now

133
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:49,540
But we'll be we'll be telling everybody down the road, but exclusive right here linux unplugged first and after that

134
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,180
We're going to throw a birthday party for linux. We're going to go in the way back machine and visit. Mr

135
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,260
Linus torvalds in the late 90s a much more humble quieter

136
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:06,500
Down to earth linus torvalds to celebrate linux's birthday and then there's a big old rumor floating around about ubuntu

137
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,460
We'll get to that and there's a new file system in the world

138
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,940
That kind of accidentally came to be and it turns out it's crazy fast. Even in its early days

139
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:20,820
It's smoking zfs. It's smoking extended four butter fs. You might need a solid state though

140
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:26,100
So stay tuned for that and then later you might have heard from linux con that ibm is hooking up with linux

141
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:32,180
And they're making the mainframe one a mainframe designed to run linux and you got ubuntu on there open

142
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,500
Sousa's are susa's on there. We're going to talk about that and what they're actually doing and it turns out

143
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:40,900
They're doing kind of what you could do on your pc, but just a lot of it like I mean a lot of it

144
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,340
I'm going to tell you about that and it's kind of quaint after all of that and then

145
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,540
Supporting an open source legend someone who's created a lot of code and someone who's about to create some code that we're going to depend

146
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:57,940
On even more so ntp was recently um, kind of attacked for asking for support from the community

147
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,380
And uh some folks threw in behind him and we're going to discuss that quote unquote controversy

148
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:09,860
But I think it's kind of interesting when a community that relies on open source code and uh, these kinds of contributions

149
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,020
Gets a little riled up when somebody comes and asks for money and I wonder what that's about

150
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,660
So we're going to discuss that but before we get into all of that

151
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:22,020
I got to bring in our virtual lug timer time appropriate greetings l mumble room. Hey guys

152
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,900
Hello

153
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,740
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hello there. Hi there now. I don't know what the chances are that any of you

154
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,940
Are going to be impacted by my first announcement. I'm going to take a moment

155
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,420
Nothing really linux related at the top of the show. I am

156
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,700
Too excited to bury this later in the show

157
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,900
I'm too excited to tease it with an ad break because I want to tell you guys

158
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:47,380
Those of you who listen on linux unplugged get the 411 first, uh today

159
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,380
Something uh kind of a big moment for me. You know, i've been doing jupyter broadcasting

160
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,860
full time

161
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,140
For I think three years or so. Who knows? Um,

162
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,820
Nobody can tell and uh, one of the things that when you go off and probably a lot of you have ever done your own

163
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,140
Small business might be able to relate to this

164
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:12,260
Scariest thing you could do when you own your own small business is go get yourself a payment on something because then you know

165
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,580
You got to make the business work, uh, because you got to make payments

166
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,340
Uh, and I kind of got over that like when we hired employees and stuff like I you know

167
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:22,020
But it never for me it never that was a mental block that never cleared

168
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,620
Uh, like i've never

169
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:28,260
Since I became full-time, I kibosh on like new house. No good didn't get a new house. Didn't matter couldn't get a new car

170
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,980
We're not getting anything. I don't want any payments because that freaks me out because I now i'm paying for myself

171
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,820
Uh, and so it's been a few years and one of the things through all of that

172
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,300
That has been consistent is man. I've wanted to do a road show. I've wanted to get on the road

173
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:47,300
I wanted to do a jb road show do meetups broadcast from the road because a it's going to be full of technical issues and

174
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,100
Challenges which sounds like a total nightmare, but it's not

175
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,260
But it's a whole new set of challenges that i've never had to face before so that sounds kind of exciting and b

176
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,180
There's a ton of content in that like if I can't do a show for for a day

177
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,740
But I put up a camera and I document the fact why I can't do a show

178
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,500
I'm going to release that as a show so anyways and get ahead of myself what i'm really excited to say is this morning

179
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:12,660
I became the proud owner of jupiter broadcasting's first mobile studio. I got an amazing deal on a trailer rv

180
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,340
25 foot rv that uh is uh

181
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:21,700
Some unfortunate circumstances for the previous owners. We became my good fortune and uh, it needs a little work

182
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Which is happening right now. It's in the shop right now

183
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,060
And i'm going to have a mobile studio and we are this is going to be the rig that I will take and broadcast from

184
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,660
When we do the linux action show cribs edition where I go over to noah's house

185
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,380
So i'm going to start on the here on the west coast

186
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,140
And i'm going to drive across us state uh us2

187
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,620
So if you are anywhere on us highway 2 between uh, japan and korea

188
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,500
If you are anywhere on us highway 2 between the pacific ocean and grand force north dakota

189
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,420
I would love to come say hi to you and I will be driving from the from the west coast to noah's house

190
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,260
When I get there, we will do a last cribs edition on noah's automated house

191
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,500
We'll find the spots that are powered by linux and the spots

192
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,460
I believe there are a few spots that are not powered by linux and I will reveal those spots on the show

193
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,860
Wouldn't it be interesting if noah had a dark?

194
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
dark

195
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,700
Redmond based secret. I will discover it and I will air it that dirty laundry when I get over there

196
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:21,620
So the idea is i'm going to uh, this is in this is in progress right now. It just all happened this morning

197
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,780
I'm going to eventually convert it into a mobile studio over the next month

198
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:32,900
Um on a budget it's going to be pretty pretty lean but around uh mid september ideally, um

199
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,700
Like around, you know, the september 19th time frame will hit the road and be doing shows from the road in the mobile

200
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,220
jb2

201
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,260
Studio so i'm very very excited because I did tech talk early this morning

202
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,300
So I could go out there did an inspection made sure everything checked out

203
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,660
And uh boy, am I pumped and I have no idea what i'm doing

204
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:56,100
Like i'm gonna have to run off batteries. I'm gonna have to run off water tanks. I'm gonna have to flush my poop

205
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,660
Yes, and imacon it has the first meetup

206
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,300
Imacon tell the good folks where we're meeting up actually because uh, it's pretty exciting

207
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,500
So we're gonna do a meetups. I want to do as many meetups along the way as possible

208
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,260
So go to jupiter broadcasting.com slash meet up i'm i'm right now

209
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,180
I'm kind of planning for like a 17 day road trip to give lots of time to come say hi to folks

210
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:21,380
Uh, I know I know it's in spokane imacon. I mean the brewery that we're going to be going to it's a super cool place

211
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:27,060
And uh, we're going to do meetups along the way and so go to meetup.com slash jupiter broadcasting to sign up for that

212
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,500
And uh, and there you go the steam plant steam plant in spokane will be our probably our first meetup

213
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,380
Along the way i'm really pumped. I'm super excited and I bet it's going to be awful

214
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,060
The good news is I happen to be tight with a mobile carrier

215
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,540
So I think i'm going to get a hookup on data connectivity that said though

216
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,260
Uh, if you have any ideas how to boost signal like on a budget because like I don't have

217
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,780
A lot of money to do this

218
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,420
But I need to be able to get like any kind of scrap of signal I can get and get it into

219
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,580
The mobile studio

220
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,880
So if you have any ideas on how to do that, please email me chris at jupiter broadcasting.com

221
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,920
Or any kind of thing like that anything that you think would be very useful for me to do

222
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,120
No to do a mobile road trip and i'm probably going to be doing some of the test broadcasts from it before we get going

223
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,520
But uh, yeah

224
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,040
Oh, yeah. I'm a con. You're first on the list. Don't worry. So i'm really excited and uh,

225
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,280
We'll tell you more about it as it gets going. Um

226
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,600
and I just

227
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,720
I was going to do this road trip in my in my truck or I was actually thinking about renting an rv

228
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:34,120
Because uh, who the hell wants an rv? But uh, if I but the deal I got this actually works out to be almost

229
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:40,680
If we take this one road trip, uh, it actually works out to be um, just about half the cost of renting the rv to begin

230
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:46,040
With so it's it's almost a no-brainer and then we can invest in actually setting up as a mobile studio

231
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,880
And so uh trip one is kind of hey, maybe we'll go to grand forks

232
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,640
We're going to do the last cribs and this is going to be like me kind of learning what i'm doing because it's a very

233
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
challenging drive in some aspects

234
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,480
trip two though

235
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,160
You know, I think then it's going to be like going to conventions like wouldn't it be great for scale?

236
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,560
To uh, just take the rig down to scale and be able to broadcast live from outside of scale

237
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,240
And then we have control over our broadcasting environment because right now one of the trickiest things

238
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,240
Is getting control over the broadcast environment at conventions because you're really uh,

239
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,860
It's funny. It's a mixed bag between uh, no provisioned ethernet to uh unions that actually object to you broadcasting

240
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,580
In their area, like it's a wide range of issues that I never ever thought i'd have to deal with

241
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,660
So I kind of I kind of find it

242
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,980
uh kind of appealing actually

243
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,740
So anyways, that's my news and uh, you'll see that rolled into uh content

244
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,980
And also there's going to be a lot of stuff for our patrons that is going to be wrapped into this too

245
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,980
So if you go to patreon.com slash today

246
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,740
Uh, you'll find out more about that down the road and i'm really excited

247
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:49,900
We're going to go crash a kernel linux's pad like uh d1 says in the chat room and we'll do a linux action show

248
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,620
From over there and I would really love to meet up with some of you. I'm i'm crazy excited

249
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,220
Something else i'm kind of excited about i'm wondering I think maybe poppy

250
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,180
Maybe it was you I got this from on google plus, but maybe not

251
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:08,700
I mean you're pretty sharesy on google plus, uh, and i'm i'm hoping this replaces google docs for the jupiter broadcasting crew

252
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,980
It's called hackpad and it's a web-based real-time wiki

253
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:20,000
Dropbox bought them a while back and now is open sourced and and placed it up on github a real-time web-based wiki now

254
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:27,360
Talk about an awesome way to make some serious podcast show notes and hackpad is web-based real-time wiki based on the open source etherpad

255
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:34,560
Collaborative document editor the etherpad package you guys might or may not be familiar with i've drooled about it quite a bit in the past

256
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,640
and uh

257
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:44,160
Now, uh, the the dropbox folks have posted up online. It's a whole bunch of javascript and jquery and uh, node.js stuff, but uh

258
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,520
If anybody out there like has a droplet and an implementation of this

259
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,640
I would love to check it out because I am biting at the chomp chomping at the bite. What is that called chomping at the bit?

260
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,840
to replace google docs now in the uh

261
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,080
In the mumble room is somebody who's very familiar with podcast show notes

262
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,880
Uh, and those of you who may have listened to a few other linux podcasts you there's a guy

263
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,200
You probably are not familiar with him actually because I mean he doesn't he doesn't really get on many shows

264
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,480
but from time to time he shows up on a couple of podcasts and uh

265
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,560
His name is joe now joe help me. Is it joe resinger joe? Is that how you pronounce? Is it risinger joe?

266
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,400
How do you pronounce that last name?

267
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,160
Ressington now joe i've never heard of your name before where maybe if uh, if i've maybe heard that

268
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,760
What kind of shows would I have possibly have heard your name on before?

269
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,760
Well, you're gonna let me plug all my shows. Yeah, absolutely. How long have you got?

270
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,440
Hey joe, if you're if you're willing to take the time to come on you can plug away. Go ahead

271
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,040
Okay, linux luddites is the kind of main one and that's a show where we try all the latest free and open source software

272
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,120
And then decide that we like the old stuff better

273
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,400
um recently just launched the pie podcast, which is a show about the raspberry pie with wimpy

274
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,040
He was the first guest on there

275
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:02,320
um, and I also sometimes guest host on mintcast which is the show by the linux mint community for all users of linux

276
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:09,060
And um, oh, yeah, I occasionally guest on the ubuntu podcast, but uh only when they have me only when ax not available

277
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,400
Uh, very good, so what do you use do you have a standardized solution for all I mean you do a lot of shows

278
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,600
You must constantly be having the show note challenge. What do you do?

279
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,520
Google docs simple as that drive. Does it drive you crazy for show notes or do you find it workable?

280
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,640
And I find it really good. I can use it on my phone. I can use it on the laptop. That is on a tablet

281
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,440
And uh, it's it's brilliant. I think now what about and maybe see this is something we do

282
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,320
That's kind of unique and maybe this is why you don't have a challenge with it is what what we compose in the doc

283
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,440
Literally gets copy pasted onto the web page. We write we write all of our show notes and markdown

284
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,040
so that way we only do the work once and we structure it so that way it can be pasted right into the show notes, but

285
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,680
google docs was never created with the intention of you writing anything in any kind of

286
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:02,020
Markdown language at all and so it's constantly trying to help by like indenting and and all kinds of things

287
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,020
I just find it to be a nightmare. Not only that

288
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,260
but I find it to be strikingly ironic that

289
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,980
that you know, uh

290
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,500
Many of the largest open source podcasts are being created

291
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,900
in a very proprietary

292
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,580
System that is controlled by google. Like it's just kind of ironic. We're all doing it

293
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,620
Because it's the best solution, but it seems like

294
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,860
Not all of us are doing it chris. Oh

295
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,820
Yeah, we use uh etherpad oh and how does that work for you bobby

296
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,900
Well, you can put your markdown in there and not worry about something automatically automagically screwing with it

297
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,500
um, it's not as friendly as google docs and uh

298
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:44,260
It's not as straightforward to share with like guest presenter joe came on as a guest presenter recently

299
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,580
And we had to monkey about a little bit. So yeah, it's you know, there's

300
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:55,940
Ease of use versus you know being freedom lovers and uh and wanting to host the stuff yourself, really and so

301
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,300
Uh how what is the process when joe wants to come on?

302
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,700
Do you have to create him an account and then what like is that?

303
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,020
What did you make him a user id and that kind of stuff?

304
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,900
So that's what we should do

305
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,300
Like a guest account or something, right?

306
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,860
Yeah, we should do that secret source poppy. Don't know

307
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,740
Yeah, what yeah

308
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,260
What I actually do is I uh

309
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:18,820
I copy the notes onto my local pc and then I print them out and I fax them over to him

310
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,300
And then he reads them

311
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,860
Listen you could consider it an advertising fee for coming on the show week after week now

312
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,420
I just curious because i'm really considering switching to etherpad

313
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:33,700
But it sounds very clunky and the primary issue that I have is like for example on today's episode

314
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,020
I just wanted to just quickly loop ham radio into the show notes. It's a boom share it

315
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,420
I added his collab email address bob's your uncle and now he's looped in and it takes me

316
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,380
10 seconds so I can do it while i'm on air and while i'm talking to you at the same time and that

317
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,620
seems invaluable you don't you don't find that to be a

318
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,180
like a barrier

319
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:57,860
The guy you looped in to get in to talk about how he's using colab instead of using google

320
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:04,420
You forced him to use google in order to contribute to your show. Yes. Yes. That's correct. Okay, just checking

321
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,860
You avoided the question, but all right, very good. Hey, why let's see. I got another question. Maybe you could avoid for me

322
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:16,420
Uh, apparently canonical is killing the ubuntu software center with a lot of vengeance according to the var guy

323
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,660
Desktop app stores are dead and their mobile oriented equivalents are the future

324
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,660
That's the message from canonical

325
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,340
He says which is uh

326
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:30,740
Quietly made clear that it intends to jettison the software center in ubuntu linux to focus on mobile apps for snappy ubuntu core

327
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:36,740
He says that the software center is dead and that canonical plant has no plans

328
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:42,500
Uh in respect the the depreciation of the ubuntu software center means that canonical's open source operating system will be unique in another

329
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,580
important way from the rest of linux world

330
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,140
I don't know what to make of this poppy

331
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:50,900
But there's a lot of people talking there's a lot of people writing a lot of things about the software center

332
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,300
Do you have any opinions on all of this media buzz?

333
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:58,260
Is it all just like are people just getting ahead of themselves or is there actually some real fire to the smoke that i'm not seeing?

334
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:04,820
I I like the fact that the var guy talks about how canonical is killing the software center and on the same day softpedia

335
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,020
Have an article titled. No canonical is not killing. Yes

336
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,180
Who do you believe I don't know who do you believe i'm gonna believe you

337
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,940
The the the var guy's article points to um

338
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,480
I had a really well written article on I think it's on pcworld.com

339
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,100
um, which

340
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,980
Kind of summarizes the state of play of the ubuntu software center the fact that it's not had a lot of maintenance

341
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,060
You know, we've talked about this in the past with wimpy

342
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:36,740
And you know when he was talking about the rationale for removing it from the default ubuntu marty install, you know

343
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:42,260
It's not had a lot of love and it's not super performant and there are problems with it

344
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:47,700
And there have been problems with the developers have experienced putting their apps in the store

345
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,860
um, and

346
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,420
Yeah, that's that's all well known. There's nothing new here

347
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,900
Well, that's what I mean it I don't know where they I mean they they kind of pull a bunch of threads together and maybe

348
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:03,300
Um put two and two together and it's not an unreasonable thing to think

349
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:09,560
That an application that where the upstream isn't actually doing any active development or maintenance

350
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,540
Is dead, you know, that's that's a reasonable conclusion to draw

351
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,180
But we've got an lts around the corner

352
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:21,140
So, you know, what are we going to do there? Are we going to drop the ubuntu software center from 1604?

353
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,980
and then have

354
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,860
no

355
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:31,800
Default graphical way to install applications that that seems that seems like not a good idea for people who are upgrading from 1404

356
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,460
So I I don't quite understand why this makes sense

357
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,140
Um from a you know looking at the distro point of view

358
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:48,420
But I can understand why on the outside looking in it totally does make sense. You know, it's what pushes my buttons is I I feel like

359
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:56,500
Like uh, so much controversy and crap gets stirred up just on speculation alone. So it's this seems like particularly

360
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,580
In the in the fact that there's no like announcement

361
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,420
You know to say but there's no announcement saying we are not killing a bunch of software center, right?

362
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:12,020
So is it reasonable to expect that we are killing it? But equally there's no there's no announcement saying

363
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,540
We are not killing unity 8. Is it reasonable to expect? We are killing that then, you know

364
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:23,300
Just because it says it doesn't say in the instruction manual don't fill your vhs player full of you know

365
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,100
Washing up liquid doesn't mean you know, you should do it. Thank you

366
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:34,740
It's you know ridiculous a bit. Yeah. All right, so uh point well taken and that's exactly what was my my take on it as as well

367
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:41,620
All right, so enough with that today is actually an awesome day to be recording uh linux unplugged

368
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,420
It is linux's big big big birthday

369
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,860
Well big in the sense that uh in the us after this one

370
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,660
That's when you get your big insurance discount and you can rent cars for a much lower price pretty soon

371
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,620
Linux is going to be driving around in some nice cars when it when it travels, but before we get to that and

372
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,740
Something that I have to play for you guys

373
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:08,180
It is a great moment in time when it was a different linus and linux was a very humble upstart operating system

374
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,740
We're going to cover that we're going to go back in time to the 90s

375
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:17,220
Uh and talk about that. But first I want to mention digital ocean sponsors of linux unplugged digital oceans

376
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,780
My go-to linux infrastructure and I think it could be yours too. And it's funny. I even say that now

377
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,380
As someone who's been in it for so many years and then became a podcaster and I thought well

378
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,980
I'm never going to do anything on demand

379
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,700
I'll build all my own infrastructure when we when we created and we moved into the jb1 studio

380
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,500
I set up a pretty nice kvm system using um proxmox

381
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,940
And several arch machines doing specific dedicated tasks and a couple of a couple of ubuntu lts machines on there

382
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,560
And I thought this is how i'm going to do infrastructure for jupiter broadcasting

383
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,980
Nope no not once I discovered digital ocean

384
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,860
It just makes so much sense digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you

385
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:02,660
To get your own linux rig going you could also do free bsd if you want, uh, but I wouldn't hmm

386
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,580
No, i'm kidding

387
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,300
Users can get started in less than 55 seconds and that's really nice. I can't even get a new system setup

388
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,700
In less than 55 seconds in proxmox, maybe if I really blast through it, but i'll probably screw it up

389
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,220
But here's the nuts part

390
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:21,700
I'm, not even sure that the electricity on the proxmox rig is this cheap because the first the base digital ocean droplet

391
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:25,700
Five dollars a month and then give you 512 megabytes of ram a 20 gigabyte ssd

392
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,540
one cpu

393
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:33,220
And a terabyte of transfer that is slick that terabyte of transfer is a lot more than you probably think of I mean

394
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,860
Think about it in terms of your cell phone plan how many how many gigabytes to use on your cell phone plan now apply that

395
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,980
To the fact that you're going to get a terabyte on your digital ocean droplet

396
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,620
And so i've thought about this a little bit and i think you know i'm not really using all of my transfer

397
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,500
They have a really good dashboard that tells you all this stuff and you can get on your phone, too

398
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:56,980
Uh, so one of the things that's kind of nice is I decided to download the most recent antergos release or antagonos or whatever

399
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,700
And I just you know what like why not continue to seed it for a few hours from my droplet. I have

400
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:08,840
literally tens and tens and tens and tens of gigabytes to spare so why not just help them out for a little bit like

401
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,320
It's not a big thing

402
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:15,720
But as as an advocate of that project it feels kind of good and for five dollars a month

403
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,080
I've got own cloud on there. I've got all kinds of other functionality on there

404
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,840
So the fact that i'm just you know, i'm burning a few extra gigabytes doing that. That's awesome

405
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,480
And you can get started right now

406
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:32,060
For free for two months if you get their five dollar if you use the promo code do unplugged do unplugged one word lowercase

407
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,080
You can apply to your account after the fact too if you forgot to use it

408
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,520
They'll give you a ten dollar credit and of course their pricing plans are pretty straightforward if you want something with more horsepower

409
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,840
It's right. Just do it just you go to this website. They have it right there. They're proud of it

410
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,400
So they don't try to hide it from you. It's just right right up front and center

411
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,400
They also have a lot of really good documentation so you can get a even if you're not a digital ocean user

412
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
They have stuff that's just like super applicable

413
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:59,960
Uh to to managing linux installations because they have editors and they really actually care about that kind of thing

414
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,560
And the best part about digital ocean is I can kind of have a global footprint

415
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:10,120
They have data center locations in new york san francisco singapore amsterdam germany and london and uh, listen

416
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,840
When I first started deploying servers it was it was literally 1200 a month

417
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,360
So you have the base cost of the server that goes in the rack then you have to rent the rack

418
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,840
You have to rent the power and then you have to commit to a certain percent of bandwidth usage and that's about 12

419
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:28,120
1300 a month to get it in one freaking data center

420
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,320
And now now I can have a five dollar rig in san francisco a five dollar rig in new york and a five dollar rig in

421
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,440
germany

422
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,800
This just blows my mind. I just I can't even fathom it because then you combine that with the interface

423
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:46,680
That is so much better than anything I ever ever used and I for a long time

424
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,080
I had to administer vmware esx servers

425
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,240
That were running on top of an old redhat kernel

426
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,800
But forced you

427
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:59,240
To use windows to administer them and it's just the slowest most pathetic interface now. It's better now

428
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,360
But this is years ago. It was awful and it burned me

429
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:08,600
It burned me so bad that i'm managing this entire linux infrastructure all linux virtual machines all powered by linux

430
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,560
And I have to use a windows workstation to manage it now today

431
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,440
Digital ocean has this amazing interface written in html5 that works on your mobile device or your desktop

432
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:23,480
Even even the console access from from post all the way up to login all html5 like slick super nice

433
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,320
Really intuitive and then they have an api on top of that so you can extend it even further

434
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,520
And there's a bunch of community apps that already take advantage of that api because if you're like me

435
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,360
And you're never going to code anything

436
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,800
There's a bunch of good stuff. You can take advantage of so go use the promo code do unplugged

437
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,840
Try it out two months for free go put something up in the cloud. There's a new release of own cloud go play with it

438
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,240
digitalocean.com do unplug and a big big thank you to

439
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,560
And a big big thank you digitalocean for sponsoring linux unplugged

440
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:54,520
So let's celebrate I I can't play happy birthday as much as I have a soundboard sitting right here

441
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:59,080
And I would love to be able to play it for you and the value of this is negative. I cannot play it

442
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:06,120
It is linux's birthday. Well things I can play are things that i've personally recorded and captured negative in the freedom

443
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:11,160
Dimension so instead i'll play those and i'll tell you about today today august

444
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,620
25th

445
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:19,640
2015 linux has turned 24 years old and uh, that's pretty super badass

446
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,040
I have a really great write-up from ours technica about it

447
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,560
It took them till about midday to get this posted just before we went on air

448
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,960
They got it up and it's a really great write-up

449
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,720
They go back and they find like uh linus's original post and everybody has seen that like a hundred times or more

450
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,600
But uh, they expand way way beyond that i'm gonna read it just because I mean, let's be honest

451
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:45,500
This is pretty cool. But uh, this was linus 24 years ago today august 25th in 1991

452
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,800
Hello everybody out there using minix. I'm doing a free operating system

453
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,480
Just a hobby won't be big and professional like gnu for 386 and 486 at clones

454
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,560
There has been brewing this has been brewing since april

455
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,720
And it's starting to get ready

456
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,760
In fact, I remember back then linus never thought it would run on anything but uh certain types of like ide hard drives

457
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,400
Uh, and it took the mainstream press a really long time to figure it out

458
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,800
Like an embarrassingly long time and it's so much so that as an early linux user

459
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,600
I thought maybe i'd I had made a mistake like maybe I I

460
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,000
For a very long time. I thought maybe I was betting on the wrong horse because

461
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,800
Nobody else was seeing what I was seeing. I think

462
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,440
What made linux fast and linux cons?

463
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:33,960
So electric back then is so many of us felt that way

464
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,440
Oh, i'm the only one that gets it and then you'd go to a fest or you'd go to a lug meetup and you'd meet

465
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,560
Other people that also got it and you would connect with them and you'd realize people get what a big deal linux is

466
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,360
But it took it took the average user and the mainstream much much much much longer

467
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,080
In fact, I have a piece from the computer chronicles. I've played it before on the network, but I absolutely love it

468
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,560
It's only a couple of minutes long and it's a visit to linus torvalds in 1998

469
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,360
And it was sort of like well look the new microsoft product windows 98 is coming out soon

470
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:07,560
let's go look at the quaint alternative linux created by some guy in his house and and

471
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,960
And you can see the bias in the press

472
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,840
You there's so much you can extract from this if you just take it all in from 1998

473
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:20,040
Here it is. And I love love looking back at the state of linux so long ago on its birthday

474
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,040
Oh, hold on, let me turn it on

475
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,420
By a finnish programmer named linus torvalds

476
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:31,420
Linus torvalds

477
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:35,500
Linus torvalds is a 28 year old software engineer from sweden

478
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:40,380
In 1991 when he was a student at helsinki university in finland

479
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:46,460
He wanted to buy a personal computer, but he was not happy with the choice of operating systems

480
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,100
the problem was

481
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,740
The machine is just

482
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:56,620
Half of what you need. The other part is the software and quite frankly it just sucked

483
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:02,860
For that one so linus developed his own operating system one he could afford based on unix

484
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:09,580
I had been programming for half my life at that point. I was 21 20. Yeah 20 21

485
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,420
and

486
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,860
I I just knew that I was the best programmer in the world. I mean

487
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,620
I was young I was brash

488
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,420
uh

489
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,300
and

490
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,820
I thought hey

491
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,660
I can do better than this

492
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:28,460
Lennox grew from one user to 10 in its first year then a few hundred

493
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,940
As more programmers discovered it they added their own features

494
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:40,780
Today there are well over five million users and the software is still open source and completely free

495
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,780
Thanks to a lot of programmers all around the world. I mean it's

496
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,540
it's

497
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,780
It's been a lot of people working on it

498
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:53,420
But even the people who haven't actually made contributions in the form of code

499
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,580
There are lots of people who have contributed in

500
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:04,300
Testing out things even when they didn't intend to they they did by using it. They tested it

501
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:11,580
Lennox took another leap in popularity this year when major computer companies including netscape and oracle

502
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,620
Announced their support of the operating system

503
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:21,260
There is plenty of free software available through the internet, but few commercial applications so far

504
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,180
So how can linux compete with microsoft windows?

505
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,500
Linus says the difference is in the way it competes

506
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,740
linux

507
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,140
Doesn't compete on the terms of the marketplace

508
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,340
uh linux competes on its own terms

509
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,980
which is that

510
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,140
Yes, you can buy it on a cd

511
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:47,260
But a if you buy one cd, you can install it legally on a hundred machines

512
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,140
uh, and

513
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:55,180
If you don't want to buy the p and the cd you can actually install it directly over the internet

514
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:00,300
If linux is given away free of charge. How can anyone build a business selling it?

515
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:06,060
Va research is one company that is not concerned by the lack of licensing fees

516
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:11,920
Licensing fees va has built complete ready to use linux systems since 1993

517
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,100
The company now ships an average of 20 systems a day

518
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:24,140
They are no threat to dell or compact yet. They're dependent on what works best for microsoft

519
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:31,260
On the other hand we have a lot of leeway there and we have a lot of things that that we can do to make

520
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,940
those things better

521
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:39,980
We can add to linux we can develop code in linux where it makes things more stable more reliable

522
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,220
And supporting our hardware and our customers better for linus torvalds

523
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:49,340
His creation may not provide him with a paycheck, but there are other rewards

524
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,140
It's great for your

525
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,460
Kind of self-esteem to have people

526
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,220
Use your system and really enjoy using it

527
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:05,680
Yeah, it's a it's a great feeling you I mean, I I feel that i've done something relevant for the computer chronicles

528
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,900
I'm, sarah o'brien

529
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:16,620
So, uh, that's a wow wow, that's a trip down memory lane

530
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:25,100
That's back in a time when va was still a thing uh linus didn't work for the linux foundation

531
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:31,340
He did all for free still and uh in you can see in 1998. They were still very skeptical about what it would be

532
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:37,340
It was just on the precipice. So here we are. I mean next year's 25, uh, and I I don't know

533
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,420
It's just um, it's kind of incredible to look bad to look back like that

534
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:48,620
And uh, it's just so much has changed so much has changed in the way the press covers it too, uh, which really stands out to me

535
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,820
um watching that clip and uh, you know, uh

536
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:56,700
Also, the other thing that really stands out to me as a father is at the end there in the video

537
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,300
uh

538
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:02,540
Linus is putting his daughter into a swing and she's uh, she's just a little girl

539
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,900
And it was just two weeks ago that she was pretty much, you know an adult now

540
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,960
And she was talking about uh diversity

541
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,660
In technology just a couple. I don't know if anybody saw that but uh linus's daughter was uh,

542
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,280
She gave a speech about diversity and women in technology

543
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,240
And we just watched a clip of him putting her in a swing as a baby

544
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,440
It's that's uh, that's amazing that he has been in the public eye now for this long and uh,

545
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,300
How much linux has changed since that clip originally aired on the computer chronicles in uh, 1998

546
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,600
And for those of you who want to look that up

547
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:41,200
You can look that up that whole episode windows 98 and linux I think is the title and uh, there's a little easter egg in there

548
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:48,400
If you watch the twit network, uh, mike elgin is in there and uh, his delivery style is exactly like his delivery style

549
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
Is today

550
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,040
I'll leave that for you. Anyways, uh moving on. I want to tell you a little bit about uh,

551
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,320
Our next sponsor and then we're going to jump into this new file system

552
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,120
So ting, uh ting, uh

553
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,480
I don't know for sure exactly how my road trip is going to work out

554
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,920
But I think a big uh big part component of it is going to probably involve ting

555
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:13,040
It's just mobile that makes sense. I'm just going to pay for my usage. That's what I love about ting go to uh,

556
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,040
Linux.ting.com. I mean just go there now anyways just to support this show

557
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,200
Just to learn more about ting and I I just encourage you even if you're not going to switch to ting

558
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,920
Just go take a look because it's it's kind of funny to see like um, there is uh,

559
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,880
If you follow different corporations some people like they put on a pink shirt and a leather jacket and they say some of the same

560
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,600
Stuff that ting says and and that kind of works

561
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,520
Uh other companies like they try to restructure their their pricing plans to make it more similar to ting

562
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,120
And uh as somebody who's been on ting now for two years

563
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,480
I look at this and I go. Oh, it's wow. You guys are finally trying to catch up

564
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,280
Ting is actually making you a little nervous go to linux.ting.com and find out how awesome ting is

565
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,960
It's it's mobile to make sense because there's no contract and you only pay for what you use

566
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,320
It's a flat six dollars for the line and then it's just your usage on top of that

567
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:05,280
So I got a couple of devices because it's not a big deal. It's just six dollars for the devices. They're all unlocked

568
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:10,640
They have no whole customer service. So i'm totally comfortable putting like my family on that because

569
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:16,480
I really at the end of the day. I do not at all want to deal with tech issues. So the fact that they have a

570
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,880
No, whole customer support at 1855 ting ftw between 8 a.m. And 8 p.m

571
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,320
That right there is so nice for me when I recommend it plus they have a gsm and cdma network

572
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:34,240
So there's a lot of coverage options depending on like what best works for them when noah's out here was interesting

573
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,480
Noah has really good coverage in grand forks using a lot of the same technology

574
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,440
He has really good coverage in grand forks using cdma

575
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,640
And when he was out here in the pacific northwest, he switched over to gsm and we were getting 20 megabits

576
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,720
Right here 20 megabits right here in the jb1 studio on the gsm

577
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,240
So it's that's what's cool about ting is if you're even just a little bit savvy

578
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,200
You can make those kind of command decisions for yourself. Oh cdma is better here gsm is better there

579
00:42:59,280 --> 00:42:59,920
I want data

580
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,760
I want to call you know all those kinds of things and you just pay for your usage ting doesn't care if you turn on

581
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,960
The hot spot and they have a they have a dashboard that helps you manage all of it

582
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,160
Go to linux.ting.com right now and try it out linux.ting.com and just go try it out

583
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,960
And just see what you think you can get 25 off your first month of service or 25 off your first device

584
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,680
They have a lot of really inexpensive devices and a lot of really great devices and a lot of data only devices

585
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:28,240
They have a savings calculator. Click that just kind of get an idea of what you would save and i'm asking you even if you've just uh,

586
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,480
Recently got a contract to try it out. The reason I suggest that is they have an early termination relief program

587
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,400
So if you kind of have second thoughts about signing up for a contract and you know

588
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,520
It's funny because you kind of got burned if you recently got in a contract even I don't know in the last six months

589
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:50,720
I mean these contracts how long are they two years now? So even in the last year if you got in a contract

590
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,800
Didn't you just get burned?

591
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,400
Because verizon just said oh contracts. Well, we're going to do something different. Of course, you're going to pay more, aren't you?

592
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,520
Yeah, you're going to pay more but we're not doing contracts anymore. Oh that really nice new smartphone

593
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,520
Yeah, just pay us 22 a month for that

594
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,320
It's a good system, I don't blame them for trying to do it

595
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,080
I mean, yeah, it's making them a whole lot of money and wall street loves it, but i'll be honest with you. It's

596
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,840
just

597
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:24,080
Awful linux.ting.com go there. No contract. No early termination fee. They have an early termination relief program

598
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,040
And you can get a great device that's unlocked linux.ting.com and a big thanks to ting for sponsoring

599
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,040
linux unplugged, okay, so uh, you know

600
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,160
For quite a while. I was running my rigs on butter fs

601
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:41,520
And of course i'm always doing that tech snap with alan. He's going on and on about zfs all the time

602
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,400
And I I eventually gave up on butter fs

603
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:50,480
I switched over to as xfs and for my machines and i've been pretty happy but I kind of wish it had a little more

604
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,880
Modern feature set and that's why this story has gotten my attention

605
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,420
Maybe a lot of you saw it too a new linux file system that aims for speed while having some zfs

606
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,480
Or as you americans say it zfs butter fs like features

607
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,880
and uh

608
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,720
I don't know really much about it because it's super super super super new and it's totally not ready for production

609
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,080
But it's called bcash fs and it's based on bcash

610
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,560
The linux kernel block layer cache for pairing a large capacity hard drive with a low capacity

611
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,400
High performance solid state drive to act as a cache in developing this block layer system kent overstreet now

612
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,960
Remember that name overstreet, which is a great name, by the way

613
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,640
And by the way before I talk my ass off and I sound like a jerk if anybody knows more about bcash

614
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,720
Please feel free to speak up

615
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,040
i'm, just based on my research and

616
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,960
Things like that. I'm going to regurgitate what I have learned today and yesterday

617
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,360
But if you are in the mumble room or in the chat room, you know more

618
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,920
Absolutely, please let me know but anyways

619
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,080
The idea here is you kind of get like uh, apple's uh, uh

620
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,360
Effect and and the other effects where you can have some stuff on on your on your big spinning disk and some stuff on

621
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:04,560
Your solid state disk that you get to more more often and in the process kent overstreet realized that they're basically writing their own file system

622
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:12,560
When in his own words, he says the bcash code base has been evolving and metastasizing into a full-blown general purpose posix file system

623
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:18,000
A modern copy-on-write file system with checksum in compression multiple device support caching

624
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,720
And eventually even snapshots are in the works and all other kinds of nifty features

625
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,840
We can already envision I and other people are working on bcash

626
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:32,640
We realized that we were working on was almost by accident a good chunk of the functionality of full-blown file system needs

627
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,440
And there was really a clean and elegant design to be had if we took the time and ran with it

628
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,040
Bcash itself has been in the linux kernel since kernel 3.14 in 2013

629
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,600
now, uh

630
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:48,080
It is not anywhere near ready today

631
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:55,520
But he's aiming to add file system features that would match the performance and reliability of extended 4

632
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,780
And have the features of butter fs and zfs

633
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,320
That's kind of the goal right now

634
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:08,000
Bcash fs supports multiple disk drives today

635
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,100
caching tiering

636
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,080
native zlib file system compression support which

637
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,840
File system compression support is not like file system compression in the 90s and in the 80s

638
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,400
We now have i7 cpus

639
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,000
And massive amounts of disk bandwidth. It is now faster to compress and decompress data off a drive

640
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,160
Than it is to read uncompressed data. It's it's unbelievable, but i've actually done my own tests for writing media

641
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,200
And it is fantastic. If you have a great processor, you know overstreets announcement

642
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:46,000
He stated some performance numbers for bcash fs compared to extended 4 and xfs and butter fs and he says it's looking really good

643
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,200
so

644
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,640
I was curious. He says it's looking really good. It's looking real good. He says well

645
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:56,160
I actually put the numbers in the show notes. It's looking fantastic. It's early days, but some of these benchmarks

646
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,360
Because bcash fs in its early state is already outperforming extended 4 and butter fs not by a lot

647
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,440
But a little bit in most circumstances

648
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,680
And yes zfs

649
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:13,120
Not all though. There are some circumstances where extended 4 is definitely outperforming bcash but uh,

650
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,200
Today right now

651
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:21,760
It's looking really really good. And these are all based on the early ferronics numbers. So, uh, yeah salt and all but uh,

652
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,000
Uh,

653
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
For example on the compile benchmark

654
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:32,400
That's specifically like when you're compiling something where bcash really sucked but not like worse than anything else

655
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,080
It turns out all these different file systems suck really bad when you're compiling software

656
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:42,960
It's like a it's like a worst case scenario for file systems. Sorry developers. Uh, and so uh, bcash fs has got your back though

657
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:50,100
Uh 140 milliseconds is what bcash clocked in and in at uh extended 4 for this particular test 299

658
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,240
butter fs 164 xfs 209

659
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,500
uh, and these numbers are all arbitrary, but they're just

660
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:04,100
The numbers themselves don't necessarily matter except for within the context of all on the same system all basic a baseline performance here

661
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,500
This system is really really fast

662
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:11,940
It is really set up to take advantage of many things that we attribute to butter fs and zfs today

663
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,500
and it's good to go and so

664
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,980
I I gotta ask the mumble room

665
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:22,580
Are we ready for another file system? I mean should we just be waiting for butter fs to stabilize or is uh,

666
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,300
Is it too late is is I mean in my opinion? I don't think i'm gonna try butter fs for years

667
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,940
Uh wimpy, I I let's start with you. What do you think?

668
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:35,780
Uh i'm cautiously optimistic really

669
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,740
Yeah, well, uh like you i've not had

670
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,620
the best success with

671
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,260
uh btree fs

672
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,900
And this is already in development and it's a fair way along

673
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:57,140
And i'm interested to see how it develops over time because linux does need

674
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:05,140
Something to go up against zfs and although btree fs has been around for a long long while it doesn't

675
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,380
seem to be

676
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,380
Ready to compete yet

677
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:15,620
Joe do you follow the file system stuff as a as a ludite yourself? Do you care much? Do you do you think do you think zfs?

678
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,220
Is the new hotness or is what's your what's your opinion? What's your take and opinion on this?

679
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:23,540
Well starting with btree fs or butter fs as you call it

680
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:27,300
I remember you and brian talking about that years ago

681
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:32,980
And we're still in a position where you're not using it and it's not really production ready. I tried

682
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,260
Yeah, exactly

683
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:41,460
The thing with the file system is is so fundamental to your operating system and everything you do that

684
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:44,100
You need something that is truly tried and tested

685
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:49,860
It's not like using an irc client if that crashes, you know, you restart it no problem

686
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,340
But if you are talking about your file system if that is not a hundred percent rock solid

687
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:58,820
And you could potentially lose data. Okay, fair enough. It all should be backed up and

688
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,380
Everything but then you potentially talking about a lot of time to restore your backups

689
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:08,500
And so it's a good point. It's not something that I would be particularly interested in

690
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:15,460
And another thing is that why pile all of this extra functionality on a file system when there are

691
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,820
Things you could use external programs, you know third

692
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,260
For example like lvm which has been in production for years

693
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:28,740
Yeah, why try and force that stuff into the file system where it doesn't belong as far as i'm concerned. Hmm

694
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:32,660
That's a really good point. Uh poppy. I wanted to ask you from a production standpoint

695
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:36,260
I don't actually know a buntu mobile or touch whatever you want to call it

696
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:41,300
What file system does that use and when you look at this from like I have to ship this to millions of people?

697
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:47,220
Uh, is there any is there any room for a new up and coming experimental file system?

698
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:55,780
Yeah, totally. Uh, we use ext on the phone, but I don't think it really matters largely for us because

699
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:00,820
Um, the vast majority of the software is is delivered as a read-only image

700
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:07,140
So it could be pretty much any any file system as long as it works because you're not going to corrupt it because it's read-only

701
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:12,100
Um the applications and your user data sure you that's that's you know

702
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:17,860
That's different and you're going to be writing there and turning it off while it's doing stuff and all kinds of nasty things

703
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,540
but I don't think

704
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:25,380
Butter fs could be considered not ready given yola ship their selfish phones with butter fs

705
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:31,220
And the first thing the the number one email I always get anytime I say something negative about butter fs now or beatry fs

706
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:34,020
whatever you want to call it is well facebook uses it

707
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,660
And I mean and i've used it and I actually have I have I have a virtual machine

708
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:44,340
That is like the most critical virtual machine here in the jb1 studio running on butter fs right now

709
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:45,620
I use it too

710
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:51,620
Jupiter broadcasting uses butter fs and it's on a super important server that I would be very sad if it crashed

711
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:58,020
And and I also have used it on two different production systems that were very critical that I had to dump it and go to

712
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,860
Xfs so take that for what it's worth to me. It's

713
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:07,300
As somebody and and I know I don't mean to be like this guy and I hate to say this

714
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,940
But before I became a podcaster, I was doing it for 14 years

715
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,600
And one of the and for for the biggest chunk of that I was responsible

716
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:21,960
For the uh as a as a customer if you have a bank where you can do images of your of your check

717
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,440
And you can take a picture of it or your atm scans it

718
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:31,480
I was responsible for managing the infrastructure that stored all of those images ocrd them and sorted them properly

719
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:38,200
And I can tell you that file system reliability is something that I became intimately familiar with

720
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:45,000
And I I got involved in the industry of data storage and anything that has the track record of butter

721
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,120
Fs is a joke. It looks bad. I'm sorry. It's got nice features

722
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:50,840
I'm, sorry

723
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:55,720
It could deliver it could be the future delivery platform of linux software if you listen to lenart pottery

724
00:53:56,120 --> 00:54:02,300
But I have to tell you from somebody who spent a lot of years in in really big iron important data infrastructure

725
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:07,320
Butter fs is a joke. It is a joke and nobody's going to deploy it

726
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:12,120
And i'm the the reason why facebook is deploying it is because those systems run in ram

727
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,720
Okay, you guys they run in ram if there's a single problem

728
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:20,600
They reboot them and they come right back from an image off a tftp server. It doesn't matter

729
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,960
Data integrity doesn't matter and it's very fast

730
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,240
It's a good performance system if you're running your file system out of ram

731
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:33,160
So butter fs works in that scenario just because facebook uses it and I do not want 200 emails on this topic

732
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,680
Just because facebook uses it doesn't mean it's a production ready file system

733
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,680
It makes linux look bad and that's why I look at these things and you know what?

734
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:47,020
I just got back from linux con and most of those guys are talking about storing your containers on zfs

735
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,560
Now, how are they doing that? How are they implementing the back end zfs storage?

736
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,560
Are all of those container solutions where they're running thousands of containers?

737
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,320
Are they going to do all that with a zfs implementation in user space? I don't think so

738
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,040
Something's got to give there

739
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,240
so I in my opinion I look at bcash fs and god I

740
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:09,640
I hope it happens because and I want to take so something else that came out of linux con

741
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:12,440
Is this linux one mainframe from ibm?

742
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,480
Uh canonical is in on this open suse or sorry

743
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,600
Suse is in on this and I want to play a little bit of this clip because I

744
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,160
I think this this is a good example of how

745
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:27,480
Big data and and really all of the different applications that we've all heard about all the different open source projects

746
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,160
That we've all we've all heard about can be used at a massive scale beyond anything

747
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:37,320
We've ever thought of before and why the back end storage for all of this is such such a critical key component to all of this

748
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:43,960
The linux one server. It's a pretty extraordinary server for analytics specifically for unstructured data

749
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,680
such as live tweets and news

750
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,260
and

751
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:55,400
Combining the unstructured data with structured data such as postgres maria db and mongo db

752
00:55:56,120 --> 00:56:01,800
Mongo db could be used for customer information in this demo maria db would be used for

753
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,280
financial information and postgres for geospatial data

754
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,280
So for example

755
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:13,960
In this box, I can I can type any topic such as uh, sessile the lion

756
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,320
And when I do that

757
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:25,080
What you see are live tweets and news streaming into maria db

758
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:31,240
And the origin of where these tweets and news are occurring their cities and the countries

759
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:37,900
Are streaming into postgres at the same time. We have spark analytics running doing sentiment analysis

760
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:44,200
highlighting negative sentiment in pink and highlighting positive sentiment in green

761
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,360
All right

762
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:49,960
So what let's let's let's add more load to the linux one server

763
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,960
So what you're going to see are three data feeds

764
00:56:53,960 --> 00:57:01,560
You're going to see postgres maria db and mongo db. This is the icon for the s&p 500 financial data

765
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:05,880
We're going to start streaming financial data into maria db

766
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,560
And we're going to start streaming trades financial trades

767
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,480
And their point of origins into postgres

768
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:19,080
We're going to use spark analytics to analyze all this data in mongo db

769
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,600
We're going to have live tweets and news

770
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,600
streaming into maria db

771
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,120
and we're going to add another spark analytics service that

772
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:35,000
determines how live news and tweet events, uh, uh influence financial markets

773
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:40,700
This entire infrastructure is written in node.js

774
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:45,260
It's managed by docker swarm and docker compose

775
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,980
We're using chef to provision applications into docker containers

776
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:54,000
There's a docker container for postgres a docker container for maria db

777
00:57:54,540 --> 00:58:00,160
And another docker container for mongo db spark analytics is all running in docker containers

778
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:05,900
So put another way essentially what they're doing on some of these mainframes is they're taking all of the stuff that you might spin up

779
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,140
on your own droplet or your own server and

780
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:12,700
They're making it all run on one machine and they're doing it all in crazy crazy crazy real time

781
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,820
In fact, i'm going to jump ahead a little bit just so that way we can kind of keep it interesting

782
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:20,940
And she pulls in real-time sentiment and info and market data for the greek market crash

783
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:26,860
This is happening live at linux con why she's doing this and what I want you to keep in mind is this system that she's demoing

784
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:32,460
Is being flooded with real market data and she's not giving an arbitrary query

785
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:38,540
She's giving a very specific data queries where it has to search through the database and what she gets from this is astounding

786
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:41,680
What we want to drill into this right? We want to use this information

787
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:46,960
so let's click on one of these points and what you see here is a globe and

788
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:54,320
Each of these globes remember where we save that geospatial data for some reason. Where are the trades occurring?

789
00:58:55,120 --> 00:59:00,720
So the red towers is where selling is occurring. The green towers is where buying is occurring

790
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:05,760
The height of each tower is proportional to the volume of trades that are growing

791
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:11,440
I want to load up this linux one server. I want to load up this linux one server

792
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,240
I want to get millions of web events to billions events and to do that

793
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:20,400
You have to type a financial crisis. You let you why not include the trades?

794
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:25,120
I just want to make sure we understand this we're talking about billions of events now as somebody who processed

795
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:30,660
All of the customers in washington states image transactions as they're cashing their checks and making transactions

796
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:37,440
The idea of billions transactions and I used an ibm mainframe running system 390 to do this. This is blowing my mind

797
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,720
So here in europe, um, well, you know

798
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:46,000
Some some some of the european countries are selling, uh the red towers

799
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:53,380
But there are some particularly this is interesting again. This is real data in germany. They're buying they're seeing this as an opportunity

800
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,600
So let's spin it around. Let's let's go to india. Okay

801
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:03,120
India right here the uh, the coastal cities they are selling

802
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:08,720
New delhi, they are selling they're they're kind of they're kind of pessimistic about uh,

803
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:14,160
About the greek financial crisis. Let's uh, let's go to china. I'm very interested in china

804
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:19,440
So china beijing they see this as a buying opportunity. Here's those green towers

805
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,840
shanghai is selling

806
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:22,800
um

807
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:25,440
I'm I just like australia, right? So

808
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:31,600
Here's australia. You can't really see it that well what you see are the coastal cities and they are selling

809
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,160
But as you see this is real-time trades going on at the same time

810
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:42,320
You see the amount of towers buys and sells proliferating. It's giving the world a mohawk

811
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:48,400
So let's go to north america. Let's look at the united states. I'll stop right there

812
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:55,360
So this to me is a fascinating illustration of of where all of these day-to-day open source projects that we hear about

813
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:03,600
Can have a massive massive impact and if we as linux community as the linux community if we cannot provide the backend storage to this

814
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,600
I

815
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:11,280
Worry about I worry about long-term relevancy as the platform continues to evolve into containers

816
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,060
As these applications she said at the beginning of this presentation

817
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:20,480
That all of the different programs are being delivered via container. She also said they're running on top of susa

818
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:27,760
But if you extract all that out like say you take the vision of the core os project and you make and you make the

819
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:34,320
App spec such that you can run the same container on a windows machine that has hyper-v on a mac os machine

820
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:38,560
Mac os 10 machine and on a linux machine and on a bsd machine

821
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:44,880
Well if at the end of the day what you really really need is a super high performance super well designed file system like zfs

822
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,440
I'm, not sure why you would choose linux as the machine to run the container

823
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,360
uh, maybe i'm just being hyperbolic here, but to me it seems like

824
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:58,320
Like linux is the most convenient platform because that's where the development is happening the fastest

825
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,840
And people can just jump in and have an impact and deploy something today

826
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:08,080
But as this matures and the requirements of a container-based environment develop and become more obvious

827
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,520
I don't necessarily think linux is in a good position to actually provide that

828
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,160
That's what i'm worried about

829
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,360
Anybody else in the mumbler want to jump in it might maybe just out of hand

830
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:23,760
I mean this i'm looking back at this and i'm thinking as a system administrator if i'm going to put all of my

831
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:26,480
Applications in containers and then once I have them in containers

832
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:30,720
I can manage them very easily using a plethora of projects that I just saw at linux con

833
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:37,040
And and i'll really after that all I need is a good back-end storage. That's then i'm pretty much set

834
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,740
Am I missing something here am I getting out of hand? I mean what am I not understanding?

835
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:45,860
Nobody has any intake nobody hasn't even put on this really

836
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:53,140
Really? I don't buy that they're gonna that anybody's gonna move their entire stack to like a windows machine

837
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:58,420
I mean bsd would be the only one that that's what I think that I think poses a threat, you know

838
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:02,500
But I think it's a so what if I think these problems are solvable ryan

839
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:06,420
Let me ask you this because you you nailed it. I don't think they're gonna go to windows. I think that'd be crazy

840
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,300
What if though what if what if

841
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:16,340
Freebsd is kind of I mean, I am totally aware of the timeline of the projects the existence of how long they've been around

842
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,420
The history of them

843
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:23,460
Just please go with this metaphor. What if freebsd, you know

844
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:30,660
Like public perception wise is where linux was in that computer chronicles clip. I just played what if today?

845
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:35,860
People are writing off freebsd as not all that applicable because we have this great superior operating system

846
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:42,180
That's on all of these systems that has an obvious market advantage with all of this momentum and money behind it. Just like windows had

847
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:49,540
What if freebsd is at that point? What if it's at the point where like god there's for those people who have who have early vision

848
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:54,020
For those people that were early on linux that saw this was the way that I should build my info

849
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,980
This is the system. I should build my infrastructure on this is the platform

850
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:02,660
I should build my product on what if that's where freebsd is at right now and from those of us who are in the entrenched system

851
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:07,300
We would be the windows users of the 90s right now. What if we can't see it? Is that impossible?

852
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:13,460
Well, yeah, that's seems like the assumption is that linux is standing still

853
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:17,460
You know and we're not having things that are like bcash fs

854
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:21,240
You know, that's that's a attempt to improve

855
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:27,140
You know upon the file systems that exist under linux and uh, also

856
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:32,340
If bs if open, you know freebsd wins. So what? I mean, it's still open source

857
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:38,980
Actually ryan your first point is really well taken, uh, uh bcash fs

858
01:04:40,100 --> 01:04:41,140
docker

859
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,020
cgroups

860
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:46,660
All of that are actually an indication that linux continues to be the spot where innovation happens

861
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:51,220
Uh in fact so far linux has moved faster than the rest of the industry hasn't it?

862
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,620
And if you look at where it's gone, there's been a lot of innovation

863
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:58,260
There's been other systems that have developed containers or zones or jails and you know what? They haven't done a

864
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:03,140
Blip compared to what docker and containers are doing today. That's a billion dollar industry

865
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:06,900
Boom right out of the gate and i'll tell you what it's all happening in linux

866
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:11,300
And the reason is because of the gpl that we all you have it all comes back

867
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:16,740
I believe to the gpl and I think that is the that is the thing that will continue to be linux's advantage for the

868
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:20,100
Long term that nothing else has and it is for the long term

869
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:25,460
I think since the beginning of linux and it is today 24 years later the gpl

870
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:29,060
That will give it the heads up that'll always keep it ahead of everything else

871
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:34,260
It'll always keep people when you're investing the next thing when you're planning on the next technology when you're banking on the next platform

872
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,220
You're going to use linux and it's not because of anything else

873
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:42,020
But the gpl makes it possible the gpl makes that code contribution have to happen

874
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:46,020
It makes that evolution have to come back to the source and because that evolution has to come back

875
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:52,660
To the source it always has a little bit of a head advantage of anything else and I I actually I look at where we're at

876
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:56,740
And I think we're actually regardless of file system regardless of anything else

877
01:05:56,740 --> 01:06:01,060
I as much as I I'm not a richard stallman guy. I'm not a gpl fanboy

878
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:07,140
But when it comes to our kernel linux made a very very very good choice when he chose the gpl version 2

879
01:06:07,620 --> 01:06:13,460
And I think that continues to be our main advantage going forward and that's why linux is so important

880
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:18,100
To be our main advantage going forward and and as the market begins to change

881
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:24,900
And I very very very personally believe that after going to linux con after listening to the things that the leaders of the linux foundation said

882
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:28,820
After listening to the kernel panel not have a very good response to containers

883
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:33,540
After listening to them stumble over the fact that they miss c groups to begin with after hearing all of that

884
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:37,860
It doesn't matter because the gpl at the end of the day, I think keeps the linux kernel more

885
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:40,180
more competitive

886
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:44,740
Then perhaps say bsd even though they have a great file system even though they have a great everything else, right?

887
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:46,660
It doesn't matter

888
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:51,620
Because if you base something off of the most competitive product in the market today, you have to contribute it back

889
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:55,060
That momentum just continues to build upon itself

890
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:57,780
That's what's beautiful about the gpl

891
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:04,420
So and and there you go get it out of here. So uh, anyways, I that's why I I went

892
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,380
I left linux con and it took me a couple of days. I'll be honest with you

893
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:12,740
we recorded the linux action show and and I hadn't come to a conclusion on this yet because I was like

894
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:14,580
shit

895
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:19,460
What if the people responsible for being like the flag holders of linux the linux foundation?

896
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:21,780
They're the people that put on linux con

897
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:24,020
They're the people that called a container con

898
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,660
They're the ones that decided the theme

899
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:32,580
What if the the quote unquote stewards of linux or the flag holders or whatever you want to call them or the stakeholders?

900
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:36,740
What if they're the very people ushering in the irrelevance of the platform itself?

901
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:42,660
I know this sounds really hyperbolic, but i'm just thinking from from like a watching market trends from a very very long term

902
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,220
containerization

903
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:48,100
and maybe you have to be at linux con itself, but it was

904
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:50,900
It was in the air

905
01:07:50,900 --> 01:07:56,900
It was unbelievable like uh, the people that weren't delivering their applications via a dock container yet

906
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:03,060
Were apologizing for it. They're like, yeah, we're really sorry. We're gonna have that done real soon. It's like number one

907
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:08,820
It's number one on our list like they were apologizing for the fact that you can't get their application in a docker container

908
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:13,860
I mean it was blowing my mind. I've not seen anything like this. And so I was like geez what if

909
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,900
What if we go to the trouble of putting everything in containers?

910
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,860
And then we just abstract away linux all together

911
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:25,460
Because these systems these these management systems and there's you know, um, I don't know 55 booths

912
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:28,900
Literally that are all showing different docker management solutions

913
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:33,460
And and all of them are basically trying to solve the same problem and all of them

914
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:37,560
Abstract you away from linux as much as possible. They abstract you away from applications

915
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:43,540
You could you could become you could become an administrator of these systems never having ever heard the word rpm

916
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:51,780
Deb or package in your entire life and you could deploy an entire application stack on a web server all around the world

917
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:54,740
But why is that a bad thing?

918
01:08:54,740 --> 01:09:00,660
I mean we've thought a problem of you know for the longest time people said I don't want to write for linux because I don't

919
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:06,500
Know I won't it won't run on everything. You know, there are all these different distributions and it's really you know

920
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,500
kind of fragmented and

921
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:13,860
So a lot of companies said they didn't know what to target and it it probably was a cap

922
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:18,900
You know a way to get out of creating something for linux but

923
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:25,460
Um, but now that they have these containers and I think they're only going to become more relevant over time

924
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:29,860
Continue to become more relevant, you know, this is something that people can target

925
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:37,220
Linux as a entire platform with a container and not worry about the ins and outs of developing

926
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:39,720
You know these packages for every single distribution

927
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:44,820
joe, I don't know if you have any thoughts on containers and docker, but sometimes I

928
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:50,820
I got the feeling and the opinion. So I'm not exaggerating when I say there's probably nearly 50 booths that all

929
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:54,340
Were trying to solve the problem of managing docker containers and I started to think to myself

930
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:57,780
Maybe it's just a mess. Maybe it's not a manageable problem

931
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,580
Maybe that's really just one of these it's going to become like

932
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:05,300
It's going to become the issue of when you ship an application and you statically link the binaries and all the libraries

933
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:10,340
You have to continually update that separately from the entire system and all of a sudden becomes a complete management nightmare

934
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:14,660
Joe, do you have any thoughts on maybe if it's just all hype right now or as a let out yourself?

935
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:18,900
I'm, just curious because you know, that's your slang. That's your that is after all your brand

936
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:27,080
Well, it just feels like almost like the dot-com bubble to me all this docker and containerization

937
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:31,780
Hype and you go to these conferences and it's just what everybody's talking about

938
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:37,140
And maybe i'm wrong and maybe it really is the future and there is some real

939
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:42,900
Benefit to it. But to me it feels like the way we were doing things and are currently doing things

940
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:48,740
Isn't necessarily broken. So why do we need to do it in such a different way?

941
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:55,780
So I don't know but that's my whole shick, isn't it that I you know, i'm sitting here using xfce. That's why I asked you

942
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:57,540
Yeah, yeah

943
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:02,740
Wimpy, I think maybe it's perhaps i've walked away and i've just seen a little glimpse of the enterprise

944
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:05,700
Maybe there's a little bit of a gap in between the two of you

945
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:10,180
I don't know if it's a little glimpse of the enterprise. Maybe there could be a mix of traditional and this new

946
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:13,220
fangled next generation container delivery system

947
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:21,780
What do you think well if we just take containers out of the equation for the moment this all started with a conversation about

948
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:25,700
file systems and that linux was not

949
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:33,300
Competing with zfs with all of the options of file systems. We have we don't have something that competes with zfs

950
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:40,440
But then there's that presentation there which shows some uh, fantastic analytics using you know postgres

951
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:47,940
Margo etc. Yeah, we had to change our storage when we had to change our storage back end at work

952
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:55,220
Um, I couldn't in good conscience build a solution around linux for that

953
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:58,340
It wasn't the right tool for the job

954
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:02,200
So we still have all of our processing

955
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:08,200
Running on linux and it's backed by clusters of postgres and it runs

956
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,720
Uh clusters using celery and all of that is linux

957
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:16,760
But the storage back end we use was a true nas or is a true nas

958
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,420
Um, and that's obviously, you know free bsd with zfs

959
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:24,120
and big enterprises

960
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:30,280
May not know about um true nas and bsd and they would go to perhaps uh netapp

961
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:33,960
You know, they're they're the big enterprise storage server now

962
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:40,440
You'll you'll pay a hefty hefty whack for their solutions and I went along to their um sales

963
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,640
You know demo day and it's all very impressive

964
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,440
But it doesn't do anything that true nas doesn't do

965
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:51,560
And the true nas is a fraction of the price like one tenth of the price for an equivalently

966
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,480
specced system

967
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:56,680
so the enterprises today will be using netapp and

968
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,240
Give it time

969
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:05,480
Linux will have a file system that does compete with the likes of zfs

970
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:10,760
I mean so you and when that time comes it will be it will be the new docker

971
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:17,640
You know the the fantastic new file system for linux will be the new hot thing in in some year's time

972
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,640
and in the meantime

973
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:26,460
People are already solving their enterprise storage solutions either by using linux and xfs on lvms

974
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:29,260
But some are already using uh, betree fs

975
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:36,300
But I think the file system will be the new hotness in a few years time. Can I just ask what's with the uh,

976
01:13:36,700 --> 01:13:41,500
What's with the dispute between how it's pronounced? I thought it was pretty conclusively pronounced butter fs

977
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:45,660
No, what do we want to say

978
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:53,420
I realize it's based on a betree file system. I mean I get that but don't the developers call it butter fs

979
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:55,420
Yes

980
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:58,220
Yeah, so it is a betree file system

981
01:13:58,540 --> 01:14:03,820
And betree fs is easier to say than the sort of the bastardized butter fs

982
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:07,260
So it's just easier to say i'll give it i'll give it I like it and actually

983
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:09,020
The other reason I like it

984
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:13,180
The other reason I like it is because I think it's actually good to remind the folks listening what it's based on

985
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:20,940
Uh, because those of us who are novelle netware admins back in the three days also remember betree based file systems and how many effing problems

986
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:25,420
We had with them. This is not a new file system hierarchy method

987
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:27,980
And those of us who had to administer netware

988
01:14:28,860 --> 01:14:34,700
Right good point. Yes those I I know it's funny because you see people listen and they're like, oh chris had file system problem

989
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,260
He doesn't know what he's been doing. Uh, hello

990
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:42,300
I've been using betree based file systems probably since before you've been using computers most of you out there listening

991
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:47,340
I had to administer netware systems way back in the day when people still use dost

992
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:53,500
A dos and they had an auto exec bat file that mapped a drive to a netware server

993
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:55,340
They had a betree based file system

994
01:14:55,340 --> 01:15:00,460
And you know what? I specifically had to create a file system checker when that server rebooted which

995
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:05,580
To be honest with you only happened about every 500 days because netware was pretty baller with the uptime

996
01:15:05,820 --> 01:15:08,860
And then they would have to check the file system and do a whole bunch of fixes

997
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:12,860
And so when butter fs came around or betree fs came around I thought to myself

998
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:17,340
And my first thought i'm not even kidding you this is years and years and years ago

999
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:20,060
Like joe said back when brian and I were still doing the linux action show

1000
01:15:20,540 --> 01:15:24,140
And maybe I even said this on air. I doubt I did because it sounded like a dumb ass thing to say

1001
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:26,140
But now in retrospect, I think I was right

1002
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:30,540
Really a p3 file system. Is that a good idea because I remember that being

1003
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:35,580
Real bad. I remember that being real bad. Like it was so bad you guys

1004
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:40,140
That I I was happy to move people over to ntfs. Okay

1005
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:44,540
Yeah, that's how mad it was. I was yeah, it's real bad. Okay

1006
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:50,060
I was like, yeah, this is this nt4 server would be better and for a little while it was better

1007
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,060
But then I I shook that off, too

1008
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:54,780
uh, yeah

1009
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:55,980
All right

1010
01:15:55,980 --> 01:16:01,820
So let's move on and uh, I actually love this next thing because it came from somebody in the community real close to us

1011
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:06,000
And uh, it involves somebody who's been made massive contributions

1012
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:11,300
To uh, the open source community, but first I want to tell you about our friends over at linux academy go over to linuxacademy.com

1013
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:15,600
Slash unplugged and get the unplugged discount. That's linuxacademy.com. Slash unplugged

1014
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:19,200
This is a platform to learn more about linux and all of the sort of open source

1015
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:26,240
Platform tools around that. I mean that's everything so as new things crop up. These guys are advocates of open source

1016
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,920
They're linux users themselves. So they pretty much jump on it right away

1017
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:33,520
That's one of the great things about the linux academy platform and that's why it kind of keeps its name

1018
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:38,800
A little sharper than pretty much all the other platforms because open source and linux aren't like a bullet point on like the oldest

1019
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:43,280
Make sure we cover how to do nginx. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no as mr

1020
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:47,520
Obama says hey, listen, it's actually what they're all about. They have over

1021
01:16:48,140 --> 01:16:51,120
1700 self-paced courses you can go there and learn get deep

1022
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:57,280
Seven plus linux distributions to choose from they've just rolled out a new certified system administrations prep course

1023
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,800
It'll be going live very soon and it is the biggest and best they've ever done

1024
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,440
And what I love about it is they took people that are super passionate about linux and open source

1025
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,520
Which I can completely connect with that

1026
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,320
And then they say okay. Well, we have friends that are educators

1027
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,440
We know people that are developers and let's create the linux academy platform

1028
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:17,280
And so when you go there you can choose from seven plus linux distributions

1029
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:22,400
And then that when you choose your distrosates like ubuntu or debian or I don't know sent to us or whatever

1030
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:29,280
You choose that and then all of the courseware automatically adjusts to what you want it to be

1031
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,920
courseware automatically adjusts to match that distro

1032
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,560
And and I can tell you

1033
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:39,920
When we were trying to come up with how to linux like how to like even maybe sort of semi accomplish that like

1034
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:46,480
Yeah, I it was it was an unbelievable task and and so I super respect that

1035
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,240
They even just accomplished that part of it

1036
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:52,720
But then to like they then they tied it so that way when the courseware when you need a virtual server

1037
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:57,200
They spin that virtual server up on demand and that virtual server matches

1038
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,200
The distro you chose for the courseware

1039
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:04,800
So everything from top to bottom like say you went debian everything top to bottom is debian and then they do scenario based labs

1040
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:10,000
So you actually deploy the entire software stack you're going to learn and so when you go to do it in production

1041
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,120
It's not the first time you've done it. That's so critical

1042
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:19,280
I really like that plus if you're doing any of the amazon stuff like any of the aws stuff and they have a lot of aws stuff

1043
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:25,200
You don't have to go rent an aws rig and accidentally pay a whole bunch to amazon for just learning

1044
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:29,860
Learning is just included with your linux academy subscription. So I want you to go to linuxacademy.com

1045
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,200
Check them out

1046
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:36,080
They've got a lot of great technologies and they have these nuggets that even if you're a little busy and you know

1047
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:41,200
You got two minutes. You can still get value out of your linux academy subscription. That's what those nuggets do

1048
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:41,840
It's pretty cool

1049
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:47,360
And it's like, you know back up your rig or figure out how to do something really nice in ssh or finally figure out

1050
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:51,840
How to use ip tables come on, you know, you need to do it. It's all over there at linux academy

1051
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,840
I mean those nuggets are really nice for a quick deep dive. So if you're like gosh this week or whatever

1052
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,980
I just i'm really busy. I don't feel like i'm getting anything out of my subscription

1053
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:04,560
Those nuggets are available to you. They also have an availability planner and you just go in there and say i'm okay this week, you know

1054
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,480
You got to be kind of organized but it's kind of slick because you say this week on monday

1055
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:12,000
I'm gonna have x amount of time. I won't have any time tuesday. I won't have any time wednesday

1056
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:15,600
I'm gonna watch tech snap on thursday, and then i'll have a couple hours in the afternoon

1057
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,920
And then friday because i'm a geek i'm not going out

1058
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,760
So i'm gonna have like all friday evening

1059
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,560
And so then you just go in there and you tell it how much time you have available and it'll automatically generate courseware

1060
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:30,160
That matches your availability and including like reminders like hey, bro, you know, you're gonna have a thing on thursday

1061
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,680
You better study up

1062
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:33,840
That's kind of nice and then last but not least

1063
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,240
It's not really a feature like that. They would put on a bullet point

1064
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:41,840
But their community is stacked full of jupiter broadcasting community members. So if you're having kind of a low moment

1065
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,080
Or if you have something to celebrate

1066
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,480
There's a lot of your friends over there

1067
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:50,720
That i'll celebrate with you. Um, and a lot of times you'll see me like i'll retweet on on linux academy

1068
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,440
When a jupiter broadcasting member gets their certification because they'll often tweet it out and things like that. It's

1069
01:19:56,240 --> 01:19:57,440
It's really cool

1070
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:02,320
So and I and I think this is the kind of thing that I would love to see our resources go behind

1071
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,960
There's a lot of mainstream larger

1072
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:07,820
educational resources online

1073
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:15,040
That uh, they they really have a limp approach to their linux and open source, you know support. It's it's just a feature for them

1074
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,040
and uh

1075
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:20,800
Screw them because they don't understand how important it actually is the linux academy

1076
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:23,520
They get that they they they close that uncanny gap

1077
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,740
I think you should go check them out. They're really cool and they also support this show linuxacademy.com

1078
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:35,780
Slash unplugged linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to linux academy for sponsoring the linux unplugged program

1079
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:39,120
And i'm glad that they're rolling out all that new stuff. Just go check it out

1080
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:46,580
you'll have your linux foundation certified system administration course online probably, uh, sooner than later linuxacademy.com

1081
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:53,040
slash unplugged linuxacademy.com slash unplugged big thanks to linux academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

1082
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,560
All right, so, uh, he didn't join us today

1083
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:02,800
But producer q5 sis wrote up a blog post about his uh run-in meeting with eric s raimond

1084
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:06,340
He got a chance to chat chat with him for an hour or so at foscon 2015

1085
01:21:06,340 --> 01:21:11,060
And uh, he did a blog post about it and it got some traction online

1086
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:14,180
He got some our linux recognition and a few other places

1087
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:20,580
And in there he linked a patreon page for our uh for uh supporting

1088
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,700
eric s raimond and um

1089
01:21:23,940 --> 01:21:25,940
He's now got up to 40 patrons

1090
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:33,300
But what was kind of weird is the backlash online and uh poppy I know that you saw this. Uh, another folks saw it

1091
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,500
Uh, um our friends from the elementary os project saw it

1092
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:41,780
A lot of people thought that it was sort of ridiculous the idea to to pay for somebody

1093
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:45,620
Who's contributing to open source because that's the high the whole idea of free software

1094
01:21:45,780 --> 01:21:48,280
Even if it's something really important like ntp

1095
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:55,380
And uh, I look at this and I think this uh, this is kind of this is kind of um

1096
01:21:56,260 --> 01:21:57,780
a little sad

1097
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:04,740
Uh eric has got 40 patrons and yet he's contributed to some of the most significant code significant code in in many popular operating systems

1098
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:09,860
Uh, and so poppy did you do you remember do you kind of can you capture the conversation that you saw on google plus?

1099
01:22:09,860 --> 01:22:14,100
Because I know you commented on there and and the controversy was kind of sort of being brewed

1100
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:22,660
Yeah, it was uh, daniel foray from the elementary kind of posted that he was sad that uh, someone asking for

1101
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:25,300
uh donations via patreon

1102
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,740
Um when that was promoted on our linux on reddit

1103
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:34,020
There were people dogpiling and saying how terrible this was and you know, the guy should just you know

1104
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:38,100
Get a job or whatever or you know, wow, they shouldn't yeah, but but

1105
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:41,140
you know from from my perspective, you know, if that's the

1106
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:44,260
the model that he wants to use in order to

1107
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:49,380
You know put a roof over his head and pay for food for his cat then that's that's his decision

1108
01:22:49,540 --> 01:22:52,100
I think it's I personally think it's quite sad that

1109
01:22:52,820 --> 01:22:54,420
um

1110
01:22:54,420 --> 01:22:57,860
There are people out there making, you know, don't take this personally

1111
01:22:58,020 --> 01:23:04,180
There are people out there making video blogs, right? Which is stuff that is somewhat ephemeral

1112
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:12,180
You know that video about how awesome those speakers are or that video about how great that game is or whatever

1113
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:14,660
is very ephemeral and

1114
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:17,860
the stuff that the stuff that eric is making is

1115
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:22,900
Much more permanent and the same goes for any any developer of open source software is way more permanent

1116
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:29,620
you know if you contribute to something especially something as significant as ntp or maybe you contribute to mozilla or something else that's open source and

1117
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:33,540
And widely used that's a that's an investment and people

1118
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:40,020
Long after you're gone long after your contribution is finished will continue to benefit from that work

1119
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:42,660
and it's quite sad that we

1120
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:44,900
value

1121
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:51,620
A bunch of videos posted online over and above a piece of software that we might use under the covers. So I mean, all right

1122
01:23:51,620 --> 01:23:55,940
Oh, i'm not I I do follow what you're saying there, but let's be honest

1123
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:56,820
uh

1124
01:23:56,820 --> 01:24:00,420
that that's sort of like saying that the document the documentary of

1125
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:06,740
Abraham lincoln are invaluable or the documentaries of the birth of the computer industry are invaluable because i'm not saying they're in

1126
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:11,460
I'm not saying they're not valuable and I you know, I personally back some pretty wacky kickstarter campaigns

1127
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:13,940
Um, just like anyone else

1128
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:17,780
But I think it's a bit sad that someone who is doing such good work

1129
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:22,500
How is code how is code any less infamorable than content?

1130
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:25,860
Because the ntp project is going to be replaced the code

1131
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:29,940
He's working on may very well never even be used. It may be superseded by a completely different project

1132
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:32,340
How many times do we have conversations about?

1133
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:37,300
um, you know in the in the context of a security vulnerability in some piece of software like

1134
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:42,820
You know some mail server or ssh or open ssl or something like that and everyone then takes a

1135
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:46,740
Sits back and take a look and says oh my god that code's been there for 20 years

1136
01:24:46,740 --> 01:24:52,260
Right, that's what I mean is someone can make an investment of their time that might take them, you know months

1137
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:58,100
Of their time 20 years ago and that's still being used today that video that someone made about you know

1138
01:24:58,340 --> 01:25:02,980
Okay, those those interesting videos that you post at the end of some of your you know, some of your shows

1139
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:07,860
They're interesting, but they're not a massive investment in the future in in

1140
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:12,740
In comparison to something like open ssl or contributions to ntp in my opinion

1141
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:17,620
I and I I actually think that's a pretty common perception. In fact, I think i'm pretty much in the minority here

1142
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:20,900
but i'll tell you poppy what it sounds to me like is it sounds like um

1143
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:29,060
Idealizing developers like they create some sort of unbelievable contribution to society that cannot be replicated in reality. It gets quickly replaced

1144
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:31,060
It's often flawed and not very good

1145
01:25:31,380 --> 01:25:37,220
Take system d dash ntp d take any of the new ntp projects being by being created by any of the bsd projects

1146
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:44,740
What what eric is creating is absolutely useful code and very very very much a contribution to the greater open source community

1147
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:46,740
that said

1148
01:25:46,740 --> 01:25:50,740
I mean, you know things come and go with code like just like things come and go with content

1149
01:25:50,740 --> 01:25:54,180
I don't know if you can attribute a value from one over the other but I will say

1150
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:57,940
In terms the one metric you could maybe value impact is

1151
01:25:58,500 --> 01:26:04,180
Uh user use right oftentimes code created something like an infrastructure like like the ntp client

1152
01:26:04,180 --> 01:26:10,660
Is used by a great more number of people than content is watched by those people or it is used in a much more important

1153
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:17,460
Scenario, so you could argue those kinds of value. I mean you could say you could say, you know, this particular video or documentary had

1154
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:20,020
You know 50 million people watch it

1155
01:26:20,420 --> 01:26:24,660
But you could equally argue that this piece of ntp software has 50 million users

1156
01:26:24,820 --> 01:26:29,060
But those 50 million users are using it every day all day in a very critical way

1157
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:30,900
It's not it's not a one-off. It's not a one-off

1158
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:35,860
You know visit the cinema go and see that thing it maybe touched you it's maybe something that you know

1159
01:26:35,860 --> 01:26:40,500
Will influence your life in the future, but I doubt it's going any any, you know piece of cinematic

1160
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:46,900
Um, you know is is going to influence 50 million people every single day of their life, right?

1161
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:51,140
Um, and I I don't want to pick on videos. I'm just trying to make the point that some

1162
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:59,300
Developers sometimes get a bit of a bum deal. But what I also think is that when daniel raised this I think

1163
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:06,180
I think he was a little bit glass half empty pessimistic because I think he believes that our linux on reddit

1164
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,900
is a reflection of

1165
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:14,500
The community in general and I absolutely don't think it is. Yeah, I agree there and and rotten though

1166
01:27:14,580 --> 01:27:20,100
Uh, do you think there's a I I feel like there's a pretty major difference between the user base backing an open source developer

1167
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:24,420
Who maybe contributes to several projects and a company who would only support?

1168
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:29,460
Worked one project in particular here. You can you can come work for us and you can contribute to this project ntp

1169
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:32,580
But only that don't you see a difference there rotten or do you not?

1170
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:37,620
No, because if that person's working on multiple projects and it's benefiting the computer in multiple ways in the community, I mean

1171
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:41,780
Then that's actually a negative. But if they're saying you need to work on this

1172
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:46,100
But they're already working on that and they're benefiting the community in multiple ways

1173
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:50,020
It's better to pay them and you know to say you're continue doing what you're doing

1174
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:56,580
We appreciate your efforts and with like ntp for example, that's 50 million users that are using it every day

1175
01:27:56,740 --> 01:28:01,140
That have no idea they're using and have never heard of it. So he's getting no gratitude. He gets no money

1176
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:04,500
He gets nothing. He doesn't even get a thank you most of the time

1177
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:10,580
But all these people are reliant on it and the same thing when when when shell shock happens and heart bleed happens

1178
01:28:10,900 --> 01:28:16,660
Why are these companies like google and redhat? They're reliant on these people and these projects helping these people

1179
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:22,500
Why is it a negative that when the community rallies around someone and says thank you

1180
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:25,060
We want to we want to show you we appreciate you

1181
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:29,940
They get crapped on. Hmm. Yeah, that is it's true. You look at the

1182
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:37,060
Exactly the case when something when the shit hits the fan with a project and there's a security vulnerability and everyone rallies around

1183
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:41,220
And you look on something like hacking news great long thread about how oh, you know

1184
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:47,140
You know everyone ringing their hands and how lamentable it is that this piece of software is only maintained by that one guy

1185
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:50,660
In his basement, right and everyone starts throwing money at the screen

1186
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:55,300
But then when someone goes out and actually asks up front and says hey

1187
01:28:55,540 --> 01:29:00,100
I'm that guy who's maintaining that thing that you quite you use quite a lot and you quite like

1188
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:04,740
Could you please give me some money? Everyone's like I get lost right, right? Yeah, interesting

1189
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:08,260
Uh, so ryan, I wanted to give you a chance to chime. What are your thoughts on the story?

1190
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,260
so

1191
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:15,060
Uh, you guys know that i'm in the middle of a kickstarter and we've gotten shamed

1192
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:23,140
For asking for money to develop, you know our open source project and I think that people need to just

1193
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:25,460
Shut the hell up

1194
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:26,340
and

1195
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:32,820
Stop shaming open source projects and open source, you know enthusiasts who are trying to create something for the greater

1196
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:34,420
good

1197
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:39,220
And for asking for money, I I don't know that maybe they're just like an outspoken

1198
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:44,180
Minority, but it's just sad because a lot of these people

1199
01:29:44,740 --> 01:29:49,060
You know are doing it out of the kindness of their hearts, you know

1200
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:54,820
And and they have to pay the bills just like anybody else and nobody's holding a gun to someone's head and saying

1201
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:58,020
You have to give to this guy's patreon page, right?

1202
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:01,860
You know, he's not setting up a paywall or anything to use ntp

1203
01:30:01,860 --> 01:30:04,740
so yeah, you know, it's it's they don't have to

1204
01:30:05,300 --> 01:30:06,260
uh

1205
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:08,420
Go after him for asking for money

1206
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:12,020
They just don't have to support them if they don't want to whimpy you have this if

1207
01:30:12,420 --> 01:30:15,940
This was an nt if this was ntp on an apple on an iphone

1208
01:30:16,180 --> 01:30:19,700
Then it would be an in-app purchase to get the clock to be right most of the time

1209
01:30:21,860 --> 01:30:27,620
Very nice wimpy you you have a little familiarity with that community contributions. What are your thoughts on the story?

1210
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:31,940
What well I do my my first question was for ryan

1211
01:30:32,660 --> 01:30:37,140
Where where are you getting this pushback and reticence? What what?

1212
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:44,180
Medium, you know, is it is it reddit? Is it google plus? Where are you? Yeah, a lot of it's reddit

1213
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:50,740
Some google plus but I hate to bash on reddit because I actually like reddit, but yeah. Yeah a lot of it's reddit. Yeah

1214
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:52,820
uh

1215
01:30:52,820 --> 01:30:54,820
it's it's interesting because I

1216
01:30:54,820 --> 01:31:01,780
I I haven't come out and said, you know, I want your money or anything like that. I've placed some

1217
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:06,420
options for people to choose to donate to ubuntu mate

1218
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:14,020
And my feeling is that the open source community or the ubuntu community or the linux community because i'm not quite sure who

1219
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:15,620
Who my audience is exactly?

1220
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:21,460
It's probably a mixture of all of those have been overwhelmingly generous and i've not

1221
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:23,860
seen or heard

1222
01:31:23,860 --> 01:31:24,900
any

1223
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:26,260
um

1224
01:31:26,260 --> 01:31:33,620
Negative remarks about the way we've gone about, you know requesting funding for but it's a bit different for you though

1225
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:37,380
It's a bit different for you though, because you know you you started

1226
01:31:37,540 --> 01:31:42,740
Um ubuntu mate while you're currently in paid employment

1227
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:45,700
So you you know, you got a roof over your head and your kids are being fed

1228
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:47,540
whereas

1229
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:53,700
Uh someone like elementary they're trying to raise money in order to pay developers to do the project

1230
01:31:53,860 --> 01:31:58,660
Or nathan dire who's trying to make an app or esr who's trying to pay his bill. We don't really even

1231
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:02,260
Where i'm confused because what if we know i'm sorry

1232
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:07,940
I'm, just we don't have to even abstract this where the money's going. This is happening today to jupiter broadcasting. Uh,

1233
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:11,860
You know, um, I I have for a very long time

1234
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:17,560
I have had a vision that I would love to have the primary source of funding for this network be user contributions

1235
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:23,220
So that way I can be extremely selective with sponsors. I can let them go if I need to et cetera, et cetera

1236
01:32:23,780 --> 01:32:29,460
Um, and I can make changes that maybe are not appealing to a sponsor but are appealing to audience members if I truly believe

1237
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:31,060
It's best for the show

1238
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:32,900
And so i've set up a patreon

1239
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:38,980
For the network at patreon.com slash today and since I converted the linux action show and since for the last three weeks

1240
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:45,860
I've been experimenting with different formats because not because my co-host has pressured me into it as which is apparently the new dom

1241
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:47,860
would have narrative online or

1242
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:52,260
Because it's too expensive to do video because i'm still delivering everything as video

1243
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:59,060
Or because we're open source zealots, but because I truly believe with the current available technology

1244
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:04,900
I can make the best the best possible show in this one particular way and i'm trying to think well

1245
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:08,980
Geez i've been doing this show for 10 years. What do I need? What kind of changes?

1246
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:12,500
Do I make to be able to do it for the next 10 years so that way I don't burn the f out

1247
01:33:12,500 --> 01:33:16,660
And I can make this show not just something that's kind of like a version of itself

1248
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:18,660
But like even better than itself

1249
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:22,180
What kind of changes do I need to make and I make those kinds of changes because I know

1250
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:28,660
As somebody who's been doing this show for 10 years intimately every single hour of the day. I think about this show

1251
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,740
I know what's best for this show

1252
01:33:30,740 --> 01:33:36,020
And what I get for that kind of change is as I get a massive drop off in support on my patreon

1253
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:41,460
And not only that it comes at a time when i'm trying to ramp up support for other open source projects to fund them

1254
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:45,780
To improve video production under linux and the support drops out from underneath me

1255
01:33:46,020 --> 01:33:50,980
so there is very very very very much a downside to going to your community for support because

1256
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:55,860
When you as the creator and wimpy you got lucky this time that you chose to make a decision

1257
01:33:55,860 --> 01:34:00,820
That's better ie the drop of a buntu software center, but when you as a creator go to make a change that you know

1258
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:06,100
Intimately because you are familiar with every single aspect of your show because you think of every second of the day

1259
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:11,700
You think of that show you know, what's best for it you get punished for it and you have to continue forward regardless

1260
01:34:11,780 --> 01:34:15,540
And it makes me completely rethink going to my community for funding

1261
01:34:15,620 --> 01:34:19,380
It makes me completely rethink that and I it makes me rethink all of the emails

1262
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:21,720
I get all the time offering sponsorship opportunities

1263
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:26,920
Because they won't they won't bail on me when I go to make something that I know makes the product better

1264
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:30,360
And I know it's the same thing that I know is the same exact scenario

1265
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:35,720
That open source projects face today because you watch them try to make decisions that are best for the project

1266
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:38,360
And then their community punishes them for it

1267
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:43,240
And then when you take somebody like eric who goes out there and says you know what for a long time

1268
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:47,160
I've tried to fit into different corporate cultures, but it just doesn't work for me, but I still want to contribute

1269
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:51,640
I still want to make a difference. I still want to make a dent in the open source universe

1270
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:55,640
And he goes out there and he asks for support and he gets shamed for it

1271
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:01,480
I I think there's also a

1272
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:08,280
There's another aspect to it in the sense that there's a lot more people who agree with him and think that he should be paid

1273
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:10,680
But they're not as vocal

1274
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:15,480
Yeah, maybe so right the people that just people that

1275
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:20,460
Don't go ahead. You hear you hear the yelling a lot more than you hear good job. Congratulations

1276
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:25,800
Thank you for doing this thing and helping us do all these great features and utilities and stuff

1277
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:32,520
Do you think that people that are criticizing open source developers actively going out and seeking

1278
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:35,160
uh funding to

1279
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:37,640
effectively pay for their time and effort

1280
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,440
are people that

1281
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:43,160
Think that because you're developing free software

1282
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:45,160
It doesn't cost

1283
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:46,200
time

1284
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:48,200
And money no, no

1285
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:53,320
Because I I wouldn't be that's that to me is too easy of an answer because it basically

1286
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:56,440
It assumes that people the consumers are dumb

1287
01:35:56,760 --> 01:36:01,880
And the consumers are very aware that it takes time and effort to make code and to make software

1288
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:04,200
They're very aware. It takes time and effort to make content

1289
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:11,800
What they don't have is they don't have the entire picture and they have what you are delivering today

1290
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:16,200
They have what works for them today and a concept of that and why it's so great

1291
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:19,720
And that's why they chose you to begin with is because it meets all of those things

1292
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:27,640
but what they do not understand is maybe perhaps a zoomed out 50 000 foot view of that you have and and and and I

1293
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:30,200
I really

1294
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:33,400
I really hate doing this on a linux podcast

1295
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,960
but uh, I

1296
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:40,040
I mean he's dead now. So let's just let's just do it. I mean, I think steve jobs was kind of best at this

1297
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:46,680
He obviously often knew what was better for the consumer in a lot of cases before the consumer did and I don't mean today

1298
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:50,440
Like with all the crap they do now, but I mean like when they launched the first imac

1299
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:57,160
I was working at a school district at a school district that had to deploy like a couple of hundred of those things

1300
01:36:57,640 --> 01:37:02,440
And uh, I remember the really really big controversy was this new universal serial bus

1301
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:05,000
We didn't even call it. We didn't call it usb back then

1302
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:09,800
It was this new universal serial bus and nobody had it and nothing worked with it

1303
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:16,200
And we thought apple had screwed us because they had just abandoned the adb connector that all of our keyboards

1304
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:21,160
All of our mice that we had spent thousands of dollars for the last 10 years on that we had hundreds of

1305
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:25,640
Used to connect all of our printers everything we had adapters

1306
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:31,160
We could even do networking with these ports and we thought that apple was crazy because not another

1307
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:35,800
Not a single other computer on the market had this universal serial

1308
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:40,200
Bus thing with this weird flat connector

1309
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:45,800
And we thought we were screwed because we bought all these machines. We didn't realize what a mistake we had made

1310
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,000
And it was a huge controversy

1311
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:54,280
And now you flash forward and usb is completely ubiquitous. It is completely obvious

1312
01:37:54,840 --> 01:37:58,360
It is it is it is it is a no-brainer and it is that kind of like

1313
01:37:58,360 --> 01:38:03,080
Balls insight to like i'm going to ship this thing even though I know today's market

1314
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:07,640
It doesn't understand why and i'm not trying to equate any of that to what i'm doing today or what these other projects are

1315
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:13,080
Doing today, but what i'm trying to illustrate the fact of the matter is a lot of times the current market be a distro

1316
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:19,480
Consumer be it a podcast listener or a computer buyer. We we have uh, we are very much aware

1317
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:25,480
You know, we like our lenovo's we like our lenovo keyboards with our track points that are scientifically proven to be more accurate

1318
01:38:25,480 --> 01:38:30,440
Than the trackpad and and now the lenovo is going to make a retro unit. That's great because that's what we like

1319
01:38:30,680 --> 01:38:35,080
We're going to make something more just like hollywood makes all of the same dumb movies over and over again

1320
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:40,280
That's why we have spider-man three times over again because we like what we like and we just want to stick to that

1321
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:43,640
But sometimes things have to evolve forward and the problem is

1322
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:46,280
It's not always

1323
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:52,360
Always great to be community funded when that happens and I I I look i'm taking my personal experience and I think boy

1324
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:56,760
I think some open source projects could be handicapped by this because you kind of get paralyzed

1325
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:01,480
Because essentially what it encourages you to do is just maintain the status quo

1326
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:05,480
Just try to maintain the status quo and make people as happy as possible with the status quo

1327
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:08,680
But there's no growth in the status quo just like and and wimpy

1328
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:13,240
That's why when a couple of weeks ago when you came on here and and you were like, you're like, no

1329
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:16,760
I know I am staying behind the decision, uh about the ubuntu software center

1330
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:19,880
I I walked away from that episode really respecting your decision

1331
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:26,920
Based on my experience as a content creator and knowing how that can go when you take something away

1332
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:29,800
Because you know the end result will be better

1333
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:34,920
It it can it can be very controversial now. I think this is a particular one. The momentum was behind you

1334
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:40,840
But uh now you're a couple of weeks into it as what do you have any perspective on the the the entire?

1335
01:39:40,840 --> 01:39:45,880
Which would it was actually kind of big news for a moment in time?

1336
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:52,440
I know it was bonkers, wasn't it? But um, yes, the the ground swell of opinion

1337
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:58,840
Um in the ubuntu mate community and probably outside it to some extent as well

1338
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:01,400
Is that it was the right thing to do?

1339
01:40:01,960 --> 01:40:07,160
I'm getting a lot of requests now asking if synaptic is going to be

1340
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:11,800
The default so what i'm learning from that is is that at the moment there is no

1341
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:15,640
simple way to install synaptic like there is to

1342
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:19,080
Install the ubuntu software or app grid for example

1343
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:24,840
And maybe in the next version I will add synaptic in there as an option for advanced users

1344
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:26,680
to

1345
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:31,240
Satisfy, you know that request advanced users don't need a one-click button

1346
01:40:31,240 --> 01:40:38,280
But I think by putting it in there it will appease them now, uh, ryan, uh, can you really blame?

1347
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,920
um, you know, uh

1348
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,040
projects like ubuntu that put up like a donation slider or

1349
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:50,140
Elementary os that make a recommended donation before you download when they get such pushback on crowdfunding

1350
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:56,920
That's exactly what the point I was making is I actually used to be on the other side of this but

1351
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:01,000
As time has gone on and i've contributed to more projects. I realized that

1352
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:08,760
you if people are really negative when people like ubuntu or elementary try to go to crowdfunding and

1353
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:14,600
Then they have to be ready for the um fallout from that which is

1354
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:21,960
Them trying to find other ways to monetize their project and oftentimes if they make some kind of you know

1355
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:29,000
Partnership with with a company or they try to sell software. That's not maybe the core software like add-ons and stuff

1356
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:33,000
They get pushed back as well. So it's a lose-lose situation. So I guess in the end

1357
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:40,120
The creator should just go for whatever they feel like is the right way to to pay for their

1358
01:41:40,680 --> 01:41:42,440
for their contribution

1359
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:45,400
And yeah, I get it some people, you know

1360
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:47,160
Some people do

1361
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:53,320
Contribute in their free time and that's great. But some projects need more love than that. Some projects need more

1362
01:41:53,880 --> 01:42:00,200
Focus than that to compete on you know with the proprietary software solutions that are

1363
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:05,320
Oh, oh, sorry. Go ahead. Sorry. Uh ryan finish off the proprietary solutions that are what?

1364
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:12,520
The proprietary solutions that are out there sometimes some of these open source projects couldn't be competitive

1365
01:42:12,520 --> 01:42:17,160
If they didn't have people working on them nearly full time ryan. It was making me actually the one I was thinking of

1366
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:21,800
When you were talking it was arduer a little bit and how arduer has community funding

1367
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:27,000
But also kind of gets pulled around by commercial interests from time to time because that's really where it makes the most of its

1368
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:32,680
Money, I think uh, and that's a that's a weird dichotomy for an open source project to find itself in because you kind of get pulled

1369
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:36,280
Around by different priorities. I suspect right and it's like what you said, you know

1370
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:40,280
If these open source projects are going to be competitive, you know, they're going to have a lot of money

1371
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:43,640
Said, you know if these open source projects fight the same thing

1372
01:42:43,960 --> 01:42:48,360
They sometimes they get you know, sweetheart deals from companies that use their product

1373
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:51,080
But they say, you know, here's what we want you to focus on

1374
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:57,320
And they you know if they want to be paid if they want to pay their rent

1375
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:01,800
And you know, they have to focus on those things and their user bases might be upset about it

1376
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:05,320
But that's what's paying the bills. Yeah, I think that's fair enough though

1377
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:10,360
I mean patrons have been doing that for artisans for you know, hundreds of years

1378
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:14,120
So I don't have a problem with somebody who's prepared to

1379
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:17,640
Financially back a project to hold some sway

1380
01:43:18,280 --> 01:43:24,060
Over what the priorities of that project might be. That's a good point. It is sort of it is a long-standing

1381
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:28,120
Historical tradition in a sense, isn't it?

1382
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:35,640
But one of the things like the core infrastructure initiative, I mean shouldn't they perhaps be expanding that having more companies

1383
01:43:35,640 --> 01:43:41,160
Paying into this pot, but then it's kind of shared out more fairly amongst all open source projects

1384
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:43,160
Not necessarily just the core infrastructure

1385
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:48,600
Yeah, I mean at a larger scale these really critical open source projects are being

1386
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:54,200
Taken advantage of by many many large corporations now though to be fair the core infrastructure project

1387
01:43:54,200 --> 01:44:00,520
has quite a big list of contributors and they've they are, you know, they just they just announced a new badge program to kind of

1388
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:06,520
Try to give some sort of certification or whatever to to different projects. They're working

1389
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:11,080
I mean they're they're moving closer to that Joe but the point well taken is at a certain point

1390
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:17,640
Why does it fall on the responsibility of us when there's companies out there like Google, Amazon, Apple and and even Microsoft

1391
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:22,120
That are shipping projects and products and making billions of dollars off of them

1392
01:44:22,120 --> 01:44:23,800
But that's also

1393
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:27,240
Missing the point that there are other organizations that do exist like SPI

1394
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:33,080
Where people can companies can submit money and donate money to them or users can donate money to them

1395
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:38,280
That and they will decide who who needs the money at the right time and stuff like that and they will help before you

1396
01:44:38,280 --> 01:44:41,320
So you just give it one organization just like the core infrastructure thing

1397
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:47,640
The SPI is essentially that but for a lot more like they're for distros there for regular projects

1398
01:44:47,640 --> 01:44:53,080
Anyone who actually wants to do it can just join the SPI and get that but I would also say that the

1399
01:44:53,720 --> 01:44:54,760
distro point

1400
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:57,960
Is is a little bit different because with when a distro

1401
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:02,280
They some reason for some people look like distros are getting when they ask for money that they have

1402
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:10,440
More work involved and in some cases they really don't but like the utilities and the tools that people use to build the distros

1403
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:14,760
Just get ignored. So I think it's easier for like if you have a thousand people

1404
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:18,280
You and you see the district like oh, they're doing a lot more work. I feel more

1405
01:45:18,600 --> 01:45:23,720
Inclined to give them money rather than this one little utility over here and they kind of get ignored

1406
01:45:24,120 --> 01:45:27,400
Yeah, and looks familiar points out that in some cases perhaps the backers

1407
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:29,240
No better than the creators

1408
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:33,080
I don't know if I always agree with that but I guess it definitely is worth balancing and I kind of

1409
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:38,840
You know in the case of our patrons I kind of look at the people who comment there as sort of like an advisory board

1410
01:45:39,160 --> 01:45:41,640
Not people who necessarily know more or less but people who know more

1411
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:47,880
Advisory board not people who necessarily know more or less but people are maybe slightly more invested. So their opinion holds more weight

1412
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:52,040
That's kind of how I look at those folks. Uh, and I think that's kind of an that's why I think

1413
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:54,360
You know, I mean

1414
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:57,400
Eric uh, eric s raiment is is one example. Uh,

1415
01:45:58,120 --> 01:46:02,120
elementary os projects another example, uh, matei projects another example, but I mean there's

1416
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:06,760
There are different projects on there where I think things like patreon make a lot of sense

1417
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:11,160
and you could use people that are slightly more invested as an advisory board and uh,

1418
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:12,280
um

1419
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:14,280
I don't know. I think there's something there but

1420
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:20,200
There's a stigma still after all of these years not a topic that is new to this network at all

1421
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:24,520
Uh after all these years that stigma is i'm surprised when it comes up

1422
01:46:24,600 --> 01:46:28,200
I guess and maybe that's what I take away from this is after all these years in 2015

1423
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:30,520
I saw it in that thread and I was like wow

1424
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:33,960
Really we're still debating this

1425
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:35,480
Really?

1426
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:38,840
It's like our version of like the the political debates that never end

1427
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:43,580
But uh, I would love love love to hear your thoughts on this go over to linuxactionshow.reddit.com

1428
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:47,480
Actually any topic you think would be worth discussing with our virtual lug?

1429
01:46:47,480 --> 01:46:51,720
I would love some really good meaty discussion topics linuxactionshow.reddit.com

1430
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:57,000
You'll also find a feedback thread for episode 107 over there and you can contribute your thoughts to this episode

1431
01:46:57,160 --> 01:47:02,440
And don't forget every single episode has an rss feed in different formats. We've got a I think hd

1432
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:05,080
I don't know. We've got video at least we've got the mp3s

1433
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:11,720
We got the mp3s. We got your augs with your vorbises and we also got yours. Uh, there is a way actually get webm

1434
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:15,240
If you're really super savvy, I bet you could figure it out

1435
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:20,440
I'm, not going to tell you though because it's a horrible format that should die in a fiery fiery pit of hell

1436
01:47:21,080 --> 01:47:27,320
And it costs me a lot of money. It takes a ton of time and I hate it. But if you're really super savvy

1437
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:31,320
You could probably figure it out. Uh, go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com

1438
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:37,480
Why do I say that because all of our episodes are embedded with html5 video and uh, well there's to make that work

1439
01:47:37,480 --> 01:47:38,680
You got to use webm, don't you?

1440
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:43,320
But we have rss rss feeds and torrent rss feeds available of all of our episodes

1441
01:47:43,480 --> 01:47:45,560
We have those linked in the show notes also links to everything

1442
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:49,560
We talked about including the full version of that ibm mainframe video

1443
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:54,280
Is in the show notes and I encourage you to check that out because the demo kind of just keeps getting nerdier and nerdier

1444
01:47:54,280 --> 01:48:01,720
As it goes on and what I love about is it's super obvious. She's not doing like, um, easy demo data feeds. She's

1445
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:08,680
Full-on plugging that thing full of really esoteric crazy requests and getting amazing results and you can watch the rest of the video

1446
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:10,920
We have that embedded in the show notes

1447
01:48:11,160 --> 01:48:16,300
Also, I encourage you to check out the linux action shows highlight of our trip to linuxcon 2015

1448
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:18,840
I have that linked in the show notes

1449
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:24,920
I also just submitted that to the linux action show subreddit and it's an extraction from this last week's episode and we went down

1450
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:26,920
To seattle and we really wanted to create

1451
01:48:27,240 --> 01:48:30,360
What the experience would be like a lot of times we go to these cons

1452
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:34,200
And we don't know if we can really answer if it's something that's worth your money, you know

1453
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:37,720
The flight the travel the ticket is it really worth your time?

1454
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:40,120
And it's something we've always wanted to be able to answer for you

1455
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:43,960
And so we tried to do that in our coverage in this week's episode of linux action show

1456
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:49,160
So I extracted that component of the show and posted I'll have a link in the show notes is also on the subreddit linux

1457
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:55,080
Action show that reddit.com and it's on the jupiter broadcasting soundcloud account. Yeah, we have one of those

1458
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:58,920
And you can listen to the entire thing. Hey, don't forget linux unplugged is live on tuesday

1459
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:02,600
Go to jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone

1460
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:07,960
I'd love to hear your feedback jupiter broadcasting.com slash contact or the subreddit that i've mentioned like a dozen times

1461
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:09,000
All right, everybody

1462
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:14,300
Thanks so much for this week's episode of linux unplugged and i'll see you right back here next tuesday

1463
01:49:39,320 --> 01:49:41,320
So

1464
01:49:56,840 --> 01:50:03,980
Ah good times good times. All right, so, uh jb titles.com everybody. Let's go pick our title jb titles.com

1465
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:11,420
Um, so, uh any other closing thoughts mumble room on the anything we talked about I have one about um,

1466
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:18,540
The you know that they're asking for money thing. Yeah, um, like so in this case daniel foray is right

1467
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:22,220
It's ridiculous that these people are getting mad about asking for money

1468
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:27,980
But it really annoys me when people correlate what he did and what elementary did

1469
01:50:27,980 --> 01:50:33,260
To what this guy is doing because they're completely wrong. The reason people got mad

1470
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:37,020
At the elementary has nothing to do with him asking for money

1471
01:50:37,020 --> 01:50:43,820
It's the fact that they insulted everyone before they asked for money. No, that's true. Yeah, I guess and it's well in your yeah in that

1472
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:46,380
In your opinion. Yes, but yes

1473
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:52,380
Calling people cheaters is pretty insulting. Yes, you're right. You're right and also never having the balls to admit they were wrong and apologize

1474
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:58,220
Right, that's that's more important because they they have the balls to say ridiculous stuff like that

1475
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:01,340
But they never actually go well, we were wrong. Sorry

1476
01:51:01,420 --> 01:51:06,060
You do kind of have to have the balls to be be willing to backtrack if you do say something's done publicly

1477
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:06,860
Uh, you know

1478
01:51:06,860 --> 01:51:11,260
It was kind of perfect that joe is here on the episode where we played a clip from lanus from the 90s, right?

1479
01:51:11,420 --> 01:51:13,420
Huh kind of fit with your whole stick, joe

1480
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:18,720
That was great. All right jb titles.com. Let's pick our title

1481
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:20,720
Title

1482
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:24,880
Insane in the mainframe is up there. Should we do something? I mean, it's also linux's birthday

1483
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,280
We could do something around that old linux clip that we played

1484
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,600

1486
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:44,080

1493

That's tied. Uh, happy birthday linux

1495
01:52:15,040 --> 01:52:18,560

1496
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:21,120
I like linux in the 90s and freedom isn't free

1497
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:28,000

Hello everybody

1499
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:33,920
I like freedom isn't free because you know, it it's very

1500
01:52:34,480 --> 01:52:35,520
global

1501
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,520
and it also is like um

1502
01:52:38,080 --> 01:52:40,080
south park thing

1503
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:42,160
Hey chris. Yep

1504
01:52:42,160 --> 01:52:46,080
I would like to plug something real quick. Uh for those of you following mycroft

1505
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:52,800
There are only two of the reduced price early bird mycroft extendibles left only

1506
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:58,000
two for 129 their normal price is 149 and then we've got still have

1507
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:01,840
427 of the 99 dollar mycrofts left. So

1508
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:06,560
Uh, if anybody is considering getting one of the extendible units

1509
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:12,240
That's the ones with all the ports exposed on the back. There are only two of them at the reduced price left

1510
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:16,960
So if somebody wants to get over there and grab those I don't think they're going to make it through the rest of the day

1511
01:53:17,600 --> 01:53:21,360
Okay, i'm so mad. You're trying to plug your open source solutions right now

1512
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:28,000
Hey, uh ham, aren't you going to a ham convention this weekend? Do you want to plug that at all?

1513
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,640
Oh, well, uh, it's not necessarily a ham convention

1514
01:53:32,640 --> 01:53:39,280
Uh, there's a jet boat races and i'm gonna help with communications. Oh, you're doing ham radio at a jet boat convention

1515
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:43,600
Okay. All right. Never mind. Nobody go to that then that's horrible

1516
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:49,200
