WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Oh, I have a problem

00:02.840 --> 00:05.760
Anybody just just super quickly before we start

00:07.480 --> 00:09.480
Maybe you guys could help me with this

00:10.280 --> 00:13.100
West what do I have here in my hands? What is this? You know what this is?

00:13.840 --> 00:19.160
Let's see. That's your intro where Apollo boom. Wow. Good. I just figured you'd say laptop. Yeah, this is a laptop

00:19.160 --> 00:23.920
This is the entryware Apollo that I'm holding in my little hand right here. So I'll hold it up

00:23.920 --> 00:27.140
I got my stickers. I got a Gunter sticker on there and look at that

00:27.140 --> 00:29.700
And you see what else I have on there Wes

00:29.700 --> 00:31.700
I have I have a fedora sticker on there

00:31.700 --> 00:36.140
And so I thought I should make that sticker not a liar and I this is what I loaded fedora 24

00:36.500 --> 00:41.660
Keeping it on there. It was my road trip machine. Really? Wow. Yeah, I want to give it trying it out

00:41.660 --> 00:43.660
I want to give a plug to no maps

00:44.340 --> 00:46.300
No maps, I use a lot

00:46.300 --> 00:49.980
I didn't use it exclusively but I use a lot of no maps on fedora 24 on the road trip

00:49.980 --> 00:53.900
Wow, and it was really cool. So there's if you haven't tried out no maps. It's pretty cool and

00:53.900 --> 01:00.860
I've been really happy with fedora 24 on the Apollo one problem though. Oh, oh, what is it?

01:00.860 --> 01:02.140
I did the updates cuz you know me

01:02.140 --> 01:07.540
I you want to stay updated even when I'm on a my fight connection on a road trip in an RV

01:07.540 --> 01:11.620
I'm updating my packages. I mean you have to priority West is a priority

01:12.260 --> 01:18.300
So I got all the updates installed went real good except for the latest kernel won't boot. It just won't boo

01:18.300 --> 01:25.580
No, yeah, all the other bits work fine latest kernel will not boot and I just get a blank screen and I did some quick

01:26.100 --> 01:30.500
Googling check on that old Colonel laying around do you know I well that's what I did

01:30.500 --> 01:32.220
That's what I'm just yeah, they just keep it in the booming

01:32.220 --> 01:35.380
I mean, it's it's recoverable because I just chose it from the other boot menu and I'm up and running

01:35.380 --> 01:37.580
I did some searching around. I didn't find anything

01:37.580 --> 01:44.180
So if anybody out there has a sky like Intel machine with into all Intel parts something kind of like the Apollo

01:44.180 --> 01:47.040
Let me know if you've run in this problem and what you did to fix it

01:47.040 --> 01:52.020
And it's also if there's a way I can blame it on the fact that I installed snap packages

01:52.160 --> 01:55.180
Be sure to let me know at Chris LAS. That's right

01:56.740 --> 01:58.740
Hang on a minute repeat the question

01:59.660 --> 02:01.940
So I've got fedora 24 on the Apollo

02:06.340 --> 02:09.580
All right, so I have good news Wes I've brought it with me

02:10.380 --> 02:13.620
All right, so let's see you've done tech support before haven't you?

02:13.620 --> 02:19.040
Mmm. In fact, I will reboot and I will give you the kernel list right out of the grub menu

02:19.040 --> 02:24.500
So I'm getting it straight from the source. Wes will be my witness as mainline. That's right. That's right

02:24.780 --> 02:27.140
Okay, so I'm rebooting right now sure boot rich boy

02:27.140 --> 02:33.420
I tell you what it boots up and boots reboots real fast, but reboots real fast. So my kernel options are

02:35.020 --> 02:42.500
The one that doesn't work is kernel four dot six dot three dash 300 so four dot six dot three dash 300

02:42.500 --> 02:48.700
Okay, and then the one that does work is kernel four dot five dot seven dash 300

02:48.900 --> 02:51.340
So four dot five dot seven was the you know

02:51.340 --> 02:55.580
It was like pretty much the kernel it shipped with four dot six, which is the man

02:55.580 --> 02:59.320
And here's here's the thing guys, and I don't mean to be this guy. I

02:59.980 --> 03:01.580
Don't mean to be this guy

03:01.580 --> 03:09.660
But if you go back and you look at my fedora 24 news coverage when the when kernel four dot six was announced and fedora

03:09.660 --> 03:14.240
24 was delayed in last I suggested perhaps

03:15.060 --> 03:19.740
Perhaps they ought to just delay it by one more week because that's all they would have had to play by one more week

03:19.740 --> 03:23.020
It already been delayed and ship it right. It already been delayed by two or three

03:23.020 --> 03:25.340
Mm-hmm, and then just ship it with kernel four dot six

03:25.340 --> 03:32.820
So that way people who get updates don't get don't get their machines ruined and and Noah said to me. That's not necessary Chris

03:32.820 --> 03:36.700
They would have to do a whole bunch of testing. They should just ship it later as an update

03:36.700 --> 03:38.740
It won't be a problem. Well, you know what? I'm here to tell you Wes

03:38.740 --> 03:41.860
I'm here to tell you not that it's unsolvable

03:41.860 --> 03:45.620
I'm sure it will have a solution interesting statement for Noah to make I'm a little surprised

03:45.620 --> 03:48.580
You could go back and watch the episode it is in the video

03:48.580 --> 03:53.100
And so I'm here to tell you Wes that it might have been just a little bit better if they just would have shipped

03:53.100 --> 03:55.300
It with four dot six. Yeah as a mainline feature

03:55.940 --> 04:00.180
But that's okay. I'll get it working. Otherwise fedora 24 on the Apollo

04:01.260 --> 04:07.020
Really nice like I just didn't even care about the battery. I was totally honey badger

04:07.020 --> 04:10.460
It was I I mean probably six hours. I don't know. That's great

04:10.460 --> 04:14.300
I was playing minecraft with my son over Wi-Fi not having to be worried about plugged in

04:14.500 --> 04:17.540
There really is a slick little machine. Oh, yeah, super happy

04:17.540 --> 04:20.940
I'm really glad I I put fedora on here just because

04:21.220 --> 04:26.820
The the slick minimal gnome setup and I did a few tweaks to fedora with like Fetty and whatnot

04:26.820 --> 04:28.660
It just makes for a great package

04:28.660 --> 04:33.420
So if I get I think we need like Chris glasses guide to livable fedora or something like that

04:33.420 --> 04:37.340
I'm working as you talk about it a lot. I'm gonna try I'm trying to keep fedora 24 on this bad

04:37.340 --> 04:42.460
Mama jammer for as long as possible. So I'm working on it if I'm sure somebody out there has a fix for that

04:42.460 --> 04:45.540
Yeah, probably maybe even by the end of the show. We'll have I saw one thread. I haven't read it yet

04:45.540 --> 04:48.340
I put it in slang. All right. Okay, let's start the show

04:49.540 --> 04:53.600
This is Linux unplugged episode 153 for July 12th

04:53.600 --> 05:05.880
2016

05:05.880 --> 05:06.480
Oh

05:06.480 --> 05:11.440
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's so packed full of content

05:11.440 --> 05:17.640
We have one of those oversized load signs. It's kind of embarrassing. My name is Chris. My name is Wes

05:17.640 --> 05:23.800
Oh, that's good to be back with you. Oh, it's wonderful to see your shining face. Oh, thank you. Thank you, you know to celebrate

05:23.800 --> 05:29.360
The return from vacay. Yeah, I said it we have a great show. We have a great show

05:29.360 --> 05:31.360
We have not only updates like so excited

05:31.440 --> 05:38.960
I know we so West and I've been there's a topic we have been wanting to discuss for what four weeks a while now

05:38.960 --> 05:43.720
Yeah, and it's it's sort of evolved in that time too. So it's perfect to talk about it this week

05:44.280 --> 05:46.420
We'll get more of that later though

05:46.420 --> 05:50.100
We also have a little tech support for Chris to do

05:50.100 --> 05:54.940
I discovered my ISP is doing a like man-in-the-middle proxy on me

05:55.380 --> 06:02.120
Intercepting SSL connections intercepting ACP connections. Yeah, that is wild. It's aggressive. It's nasty

06:02.540 --> 06:06.780
I've got the netalyzer report where to talk about it and then maybe come up with a few ways

06:06.780 --> 06:13.420
I could DIY or brainstorm or maybe a service I could work with that works great with Linux to get around some of these problems

06:13.420 --> 06:18.120
It's also just good. If you have some privacy concerns, you want to protect your traffic online

06:18.120 --> 06:22.280
We'll be discussing that and of course Linux user focused way in today's episode

06:22.400 --> 06:28.080
There is big reviews hitting the web for the world's best Linux distribution

06:28.080 --> 06:30.480
We'll tell you which distro that is what the reviews are saying

06:30.480 --> 06:34.480
We've also got updates from the horse's mouth in here and then towards the end of the show

06:35.260 --> 06:41.280
We're gonna talk about matrix. No, no, not not the neo kind of matrix and not the math thing

06:41.280 --> 06:45.020
No, no, you know, it is an overused word as the chat room was saying earlier

06:46.000 --> 06:52.360
Matrix is a technology. We talked about a long time ago really before I even really understood what slack was, right?

06:52.360 --> 06:58.560
And it's such a better idea than slack. It's so much more than that because it's a bunch of open-source standards

06:58.560 --> 07:00.560
It's a it is a platform

07:00.900 --> 07:05.080
We have an interview with one of the developers. We have a major development in a

07:05.760 --> 07:10.480
Pretty cool way that's come out. I think just in the last week or so. It's written in rust

07:10.480 --> 07:14.080
It's gonna work with matrix. We're gonna tell you all about it and why you should even care about these words

07:14.080 --> 07:21.040
I'm saying right now. So before we do any of that, let's bring in our virtual log time appropriate greens mama room

07:30.880 --> 07:39.040
Hello guys, so we have right now some big breaking news to get to we have to start off with the biggest story in the

07:39.040 --> 07:41.040
entire Linux ecosphere

07:43.520 --> 07:49.240
Linux mint 18 is the best Linux desktop period ever ever

07:50.280 --> 07:57.680
Stephen J says he's been using Linux for 25 years and today the best desktop is the latest version of Linux mint

07:57.840 --> 08:01.920
Linux mint 18 Sarah with the cinnamon in a fit interface

08:02.640 --> 08:06.680
Over at info world a gym does a roundup of different reviews

08:06.680 --> 08:10.260
Hectic geeks is Linux 18 is how Linux should be done

08:10.640 --> 08:15.200
Distro watch Linux mint 18 is stable and problem-free experience

08:15.440 --> 08:21.400
Unix mint Linux mint 18 has it all Matthew Moore says two thumbs up for Linux mint 18 and

08:22.040 --> 08:27.840
The reviews go on they're all positive. They're all super positive with and

08:28.840 --> 08:33.360
You know what? I thought I thought this first comment. I'm not sure if it's the first comment anymore

08:33.360 --> 08:40.040
Yeah, it's not the first comment anymore. Too bad. The first comment that was on Stephen's article summed it up for me

08:40.680 --> 08:41.600
I

08:41.600 --> 08:46.640
Hear this every single time with Linux mint and I generally give it a positive review myself

08:46.640 --> 08:49.560
But I don't know if it's the best Linux period

08:49.560 --> 08:53.240
I don't know if it's the best desktop distribution in 25 years

08:53.440 --> 09:00.080
But boy the hyperbole is strong with this one, right and it almost makes me sort of want to repel from it

09:00.080 --> 09:03.880
And it like just I just I don't want that. Mm-hmm. I

09:04.760 --> 09:09.480
I when I looked at it. I thought it was it was adequate and good. I thought the improvements were nice

09:09.480 --> 09:12.880
I think part of the part of the problem too here is that there's like I mean obviously you have to

09:13.160 --> 09:16.000
What he doesn't mention as much as what the audience he's writing for here is

09:16.000 --> 09:21.760
So I think if it if he's talking about people coming from Windows or new Linux users or people who just want a computer

09:21.760 --> 09:27.680
Without any of the other joys and awesome things that Linux users know how to do then maybe that's right

09:27.680 --> 09:34.580
Maybe that's right. Maybe that's true. I'm not sure that it is Wow. I am I am that is that is exactly the conclusion

09:34.580 --> 09:38.120
I came to you nailed exactly what I was thinking like

09:38.640 --> 09:43.860
Perfectly, this is if you like the Windows paradigm set it and forget it just you know

09:43.860 --> 09:45.920
Like people will know what to do start menu

09:46.440 --> 09:48.960
taskbar icons on the desktop

09:49.560 --> 09:54.520
That if you like that paradigm this then this is a great distribution for you

09:54.520 --> 09:58.360
If you like the UI that we came up with 25 years ago

09:58.720 --> 10:02.520
30 years ago, or if you if you want to give if you want to give credit to Xerox

10:02.520 --> 10:03.360
Yeah, right, you know

10:03.360 --> 10:03.880
Okay

10:03.880 --> 10:11.360
Then more than 30 years ago if that's the paradigm of desktop UI you want to go with and you think that's probably a good

10:11.360 --> 10:17.620
Way to go for the next 5-10 years then Linux Mint 18 is a great desktop view. I mean they polished a lot

10:18.200 --> 10:21.000
The X app still have a weird name, but they're not terrible

10:21.000 --> 10:25.120
And you know it's a very pleasant and usable experience, but it's not exciting

10:25.120 --> 10:30.800
And it's probably not I mean best probably if best means more than usable and what is expected then I don't know if it's I

10:31.000 --> 10:36.860
Actually think it's a great release, and I'm I'm just sort of playing devil's advocate here because it obviously serves a market

10:37.520 --> 10:43.780
And I think the donation model the donation revenue show that for Clem that people really like what he's doing here

10:43.800 --> 10:47.400
So I think there is obviously a market that this still serves

10:47.400 --> 10:52.640
I guess part of me what would part of me what it does actually if I'm being if I'm being sincere with my criticism

10:52.640 --> 10:54.640
I would say the part that does repel me is

10:55.400 --> 10:59.960
it feels like a lot of the credit goes to Ubuntu 1604 and

11:01.280 --> 11:07.000
Then they put stuff on top of that like if you took out the Ubuntu stuff you took out the Ubuntu packages

11:07.000 --> 11:12.280
And you took out of it it it feels like it gets attention in a way that

11:12.280 --> 11:18.880
That Ubuntu flavors official flavors don't that's true. You're right. It's because it seemed people consider it more separate

11:18.880 --> 11:23.160
Yeah, they consider it is but but it's but in some way that it is yeah

11:23.160 --> 11:25.680
I mean not as much right in some ways

11:25.680 --> 11:30.920
It's more it is just it is just an unofficial flavor that has a lot more

11:31.680 --> 11:35.280
well, not even that a lot just its own custom packages on top of it and

11:36.800 --> 11:40.920
But the way it's talked about is almost like it's its own entire operating system

11:40.920 --> 11:45.400
If you think about if you think about the whole fact that the under the underlying

11:46.640 --> 11:52.360
70% or maybe even arguably 90% of the operating system is created by somebody else

11:53.200 --> 11:58.760
Does it still hold up that it's the best desktop ever when it's based on 90% of somebody else's work?

11:59.360 --> 12:01.640
Maybe best desktop flavor ever

12:03.080 --> 12:05.520
It's fine and fair to say that

12:05.520 --> 12:12.360
Realistically speaking. It's our mentality that this is all one system. It actually screws this distribution

12:13.080 --> 12:18.760
We just claim that there are different operating systems because they are they are free to diverge when they want

12:19.160 --> 12:22.040
Free to make stupid decisions too true

12:22.040 --> 12:25.120
So it's like just consider them different operating systems

12:25.360 --> 12:30.640
Let them innovate on their own and then for once and for all we will actually look at well

12:30.640 --> 12:36.320
This suits my purpose or not will be able to benefit from innovation things that are good to crossbreed

12:36.320 --> 12:41.800
We crossbreed but the rest it's unique. I don't know if I completely agree wimpy. What are your thoughts on this?

12:41.800 --> 12:44.800
It is it does this feel like?

12:45.800 --> 12:50.980
90% of the work is being done by somebody else and that feels when you take the overall product

12:51.480 --> 12:55.360
Into consideration you should factor that in or is it a completely separate beast?

12:55.360 --> 13:00.400
Well when I started Ubuntu mate and it was unofficial

13:01.360 --> 13:07.780
really what I was taking there was the Ubuntu base and a lot of the packages from the Ubuntu system and

13:07.780 --> 13:12.360
Then adding the mate packages on top now to give you some idea right now

13:12.800 --> 13:18.260
There are 35 packages that divine the Ubuntu mate bit

13:18.480 --> 13:21.720
that sits on top of the Ubuntu bit and

13:21.720 --> 13:28.640
And 35 packages is a very very small number of packages in totality when you compare everything else

13:28.640 --> 13:33.560
Yeah, so my smiley with mint is mint is considerably more. Well, no

13:33.560 --> 13:36.680
Well only because they choose to do that not because they have

13:39.720 --> 13:41.560
Say the following though

13:41.560 --> 13:46.360
When the user comes in and sees a set of experiences of pre

13:47.120 --> 13:49.000
like we say that

13:49.000 --> 13:54.240
Default is king happens to a lot of people they're coming for the default experience

13:54.240 --> 13:57.400
That was curated even though they selected a base

13:57.400 --> 14:03.760
They selected the reason did the enough necessary adjustments so that it makes that group feel at home

14:03.760 --> 14:09.480
Yeah, I'd say that that's and also who's the first to answer in case of necessity?

14:10.240 --> 14:14.960
If you are doing that and not just delegating to upstream. Hey go go bother Ubuntu guys

14:14.960 --> 14:20.040
That's an Ubuntu issue if they're not doing that. They're actually taking responsibility for their system

14:20.040 --> 14:24.720
I think it's fair to say that it's their work. I think that's an I think that's an interesting standard

14:24.720 --> 14:26.720
And I think that is actually probably

14:27.000 --> 14:33.160
That right there that that last piece is probably one of the clear markers that makes them their own beast versus a flavor

14:34.680 --> 14:40.660
But yet technologically underneath still so much of the code is shared I guess the point I'm making is

14:40.660 --> 14:47.640
Is it really the best I think that's overshooting I think I think when you make that statement

14:48.660 --> 14:51.860
You're kind of subjective, right? Yeah qualifiers

14:51.860 --> 14:58.420
So you can you can't never get best out of on being personal. So yeah, that will be that

14:58.980 --> 15:02.860
Okay. So before we move on to something completely different any other thoughts on that topic?

15:04.140 --> 15:06.700
Okay, so I see completely different

15:06.700 --> 15:12.300
Let's talk about solace. Ike is here to tell I don't even know how this is possible because I've been told

15:12.900 --> 15:17.260
That the process of transitioning to a rolling release is big

15:17.260 --> 15:20.540
I mean if you ask the folks over at openSUSE or canonical

15:20.780 --> 15:26.220
They've ever implemented in the case of openSUSE or in canonical considered going rolling release

15:26.560 --> 15:31.500
Apparently you have to reinvent all of the things and reconsider all of the things but somehow

15:31.500 --> 15:38.460
Somehow when you're a small nimble distribution that distribution that keeps surprising us that's all of us from I key and team over there

15:38.660 --> 15:41.060
In fact, there's a post here by Josh that talks about

15:41.700 --> 15:47.660
Their latest release of solace basically becoming indefinitely supported because the distros going rolling I key. How can you do this?

15:47.660 --> 15:51.380
Are you crazy? I've heard this is unstable. What are you doing to us all?

15:52.980 --> 15:54.980
Well, I mean obviously I'm crazy anyway

15:54.980 --> 16:00.060
Okay, good good check that one's totally confirmed but I mean as for going rolling

16:00.060 --> 16:05.300
It's it's kind of easier for us because we stuck we suck at trying to do the whole stable model

16:06.500 --> 16:09.540
Like we're really really not good at it. We're better at doing the rolling stuff

16:09.540 --> 16:12.200
I mean for an example solace has already got like

16:12.540 --> 16:19.700
Mesa 12.0 and we was using the RC for to land open jail 4.3 and so already like we already had that stuff in

16:19.980 --> 16:23.380
We got GCC 5.3. D. Lipsy 2.2 free

16:23.380 --> 16:25.860
So we kind of sucked at not being rolling

16:28.260 --> 16:31.860
It seems like you guys have have opted for stability in key areas

16:31.860 --> 16:34.820
Like one that I think a lot of people would appreciate that want to do gaming is

16:35.100 --> 16:41.340
Graphic stack seems to be pretty on target remains pretty like like that's a goal of yours to keep that stable, correct? Oh

16:42.100 --> 16:45.720
Yeah, definitely the graphic stack. It's basically sacred and solace

16:45.740 --> 16:53.220
yeah, so there are elements of solace that you're very more cautious with but it seems like you just I mean like for example like you

16:53.220 --> 16:56.660
Said you just ended up put to make it great ended up putting a lot of this newer stuff in there

16:56.660 --> 16:58.900
So what is the transition like to go from rolling?

16:58.900 --> 17:04.280
Is that just now you'll just update the repos more often that's all that really changes or is there actually more changes behind the scene?

17:05.500 --> 17:07.180
well, I mean

17:07.180 --> 17:14.400
You gave the examples like open Zeus and you know, like the the other initials. They're they're designed differently than solace was

17:14.820 --> 17:17.180
I mean our packaging is completely different

17:17.180 --> 17:22.020
Everything is that little bit more simpler the way that we maintain packages and the way that that worked out

17:22.020 --> 17:27.540
It's actually easier to do a rolling release than it would be to make it static because we haven't had a solace to yet

17:27.540 --> 17:30.300
Have we right right? So we're still in this one particular repo

17:30.300 --> 17:34.580
So we don't have all that infrastructure in place that says that it just has to go into this repo

17:34.580 --> 17:37.780
And then it goes into that other repo and this is how you branch between them

17:37.900 --> 17:43.700
So we don't actually have anything to undo which makes it a lot easier for us. I got you it won't be you had a question

17:44.540 --> 17:47.300
Yeah, I key. I was just wondering if you've had to

17:47.300 --> 17:51.180
devise or communicate any new rules

17:51.620 --> 17:56.080
In order to support being a rolling release or is it just business as usual now?

17:57.340 --> 17:59.580
Well, I mean it's not strictly

18:00.300 --> 18:03.700
Business as usual to support this you're gonna you know yourself

18:03.700 --> 18:05.700
You're gonna have to have a few tooling changes in places

18:06.000 --> 18:09.180
The main thing that we have to avoid now is a BI breaks

18:09.340 --> 18:12.220
So anyone who's ever been on a full rolling release

18:12.220 --> 18:18.620
We'll know the horror and pain of one day getting an update to something like lib png and their system no longer

18:21.140 --> 18:28.260
Yeah, I mean for things like that we have to completely avoid but that just means building slightly extra tooling around Y package to generate

18:28.260 --> 18:33.940
ABI reports so we will know in advance that something is going to break and these reverse dependencies need

18:34.500 --> 18:40.200
Unbreaking before we then sync them. So we've got the unstable repo which is like do not touch this

18:40.200 --> 18:46.000
Do not ever use this unless you are on IRC 24-7 and that's kind of what we've always had

18:46.000 --> 18:48.400
That's the immediate dumping ground of the builder

18:49.080 --> 18:52.320
But once those have proven themselves and we're all right with them

18:52.320 --> 18:56.980
They then get synced back into the main repo and then all the main repo users get the updates

18:58.840 --> 19:04.680
This is having the mechanics to handle SO bumps for example and rebuilding all of the affected packages

19:04.680 --> 19:12.040
Yeah, I mean I would say that would be the the main problem with that especially have you had something like a junior to it

19:12.040 --> 19:18.440
TLS if I got an update and you don't want a brick network manager, for example, because then nobody can ever get an update again

19:19.880 --> 19:22.320
Which bit of a problem evil out

19:23.080 --> 19:24.880
What about?

19:24.880 --> 19:29.120
Approaches to patching upstream you planning to ship up stream

19:29.120 --> 19:34.520
As vanilla as possible or are you going to be carrying distribution patches?

19:35.640 --> 19:42.880
So in the majority of cases we try and carry things as vanilla as we can in some cases that doesn't always work

19:43.000 --> 19:47.840
There's some kind of build issue or it doesn't quite work with the way that things got installed

19:47.840 --> 19:52.440
But I mean, I think that's kind of standard distro weight that you would have anyway versus technical debt

19:52.440 --> 19:59.120
and so but these these are to support the build system rather than to change behavior or

19:59.360 --> 20:01.760
Look and feel for example, right?

20:01.760 --> 20:06.380
And there's only a very minimal amount of places that we've done anything that would impact the look and feel

20:07.040 --> 20:11.320
That was things like the default G sentence schemas, but that's because we ship budget by default

20:11.320 --> 20:16.000
We've actually shipped we've started moving away from that and doing everything in a single branding package

20:16.040 --> 20:20.680
Which doesn't provide all the relevant overrides like you would do with a bunch of matte. Yeah

20:20.680 --> 20:27.040
So keeping everything as vanilla as we can because then you have less of a diff to worry about if a new update comes through

20:27.040 --> 20:29.040
Well, you haven't got to read base a dozen batches

20:29.560 --> 20:33.720
Which obviously makes life that much easier because it's just a bump. Mm-hmm

20:34.760 --> 20:37.240
So also along with all of those things

20:37.960 --> 20:41.920
There is an improvement to YPKG package manager, which I don't

20:42.440 --> 20:44.440
Just to explain this to me like I've never used

20:45.280 --> 20:48.920
YPKG before I key what what is the benefit of supporting?

20:48.920 --> 20:54.480
Git as a source. I have an idea, but I just wonder if you could actually explain it to me from your mouth

20:56.200 --> 21:02.480
Well, there's a couple of reasons to support this and not everyone has the infrastructure to actually distribute their own tarballs

21:03.800 --> 21:05.840
So if you look at something like gnome

21:05.840 --> 21:11.800
They have hundreds of tarballs going back years and years like to gnome 2.x and they're fine to do that

21:11.920 --> 21:17.440
not all the projects can do that and quite often the tarballs go missing or the tarballs aren't generated and

21:17.440 --> 21:23.200
You know like a lot of the projects now aren't even bothering to generate the tarballs anymore

21:23.320 --> 21:30.120
They you know, they're relying on get up github tags, which are auto generating a complete not a nightmare

21:30.120 --> 21:33.520
Yeah, I'm like most of the arch AUR packages

21:33.520 --> 21:38.560
So the way that we're gonna do it is if something is good only we're gonna support the git and then you'll be able to download

21:38.560 --> 21:42.240
It via a tag, which is you know, especially what you want to do

21:42.240 --> 21:44.520
You want an immutable tag an immutable point in history?

21:44.520 --> 21:49.600
So we'll be able to build directly from get now, which it just opens up options for yeah, I guess

21:49.600 --> 21:51.600
Wow, I gotta say

21:51.880 --> 21:57.840
Almost almost on a damn near weekly basis your project has something that makes me go. That's kind of cool

21:57.840 --> 22:02.720
And I'm in particular the rolling. It's just the fact that I won't have to worry about. Yeah that yeah

22:03.640 --> 22:07.140
But but also going to but also having some confidence that you know

22:07.140 --> 22:12.700
My graphic stacks probably gonna be pretty solid which means that when I want to chill out and play video games or feels like a nice

22:12.700 --> 22:18.440
Mix like you're optimizing the results not just new things or staying stable. It's a happy medium

22:18.560 --> 22:21.640
Yeah, I mean if I might elaborate on that whole graphics thing

22:21.640 --> 22:25.400
So, I mean obviously I knew straight away when I was doing, you know

22:25.400 --> 22:28.840
Like the work we did there with Linux team integration the solar steam run time

22:28.880 --> 22:35.080
Obviously, I knew how important that was already, but I only recently got to experience that fully for the first time myself

22:35.520 --> 22:39.920
So I bought an optimist laptop for solace because we have to enable these evil things

22:39.920 --> 22:46.600
And it's like an Nvidia GTX 765 em, I think so if like for me

22:46.600 --> 22:50.640
This is the first time I've basically bought anything with a graphics card since I was

22:51.440 --> 22:53.440
15

22:54.960 --> 22:59.800
So, I mean that was like an ino3d GeForce FX 5200 tornado

23:01.120 --> 23:05.360
Sacrifices you make for the user base. Yeah, so I finally got this one. It's like, okay

23:05.360 --> 23:07.600
I'm gonna try out these games that everyone else is playing

23:07.600 --> 23:13.440
So originally I put Ubuntu on it because I wanted to see yeah, I know I went in using over distro

23:13.440 --> 23:18.640
I know I'm bad, but I wanted to see how optimist support actually worked and how it was implemented in other places

23:19.120 --> 23:24.440
So I put Ubuntu on it and it was basically a case of either use the Nvidia or don't

23:25.520 --> 23:31.680
So I was okay, which basically brings your battery life down from something like four hours to 40 minutes. Yeah, seriously

23:32.240 --> 23:36.560
It's like you are screwed. You're going nowhere. Keep the plug in or you're gonna die and you're done

23:36.560 --> 23:38.640
So I was playing it on that and I was playing

23:39.280 --> 23:41.520
Counter-Strike Global Offensive never played it for me life

23:41.520 --> 23:44.840
And I was like, I'm gonna have a go at this and it was it was running

23:44.840 --> 23:47.120
Okay, but I had to put it down up to medium settings

23:47.360 --> 23:53.800
So at some stage I completely bricked the Ubuntu install because apparently I don't know how Debian and Ubuntu work anymore

23:54.400 --> 23:56.280
I've just forgotten

23:56.280 --> 24:01.480
So I put Solus on it completely forgot about all the settings didn't bother putting the change in any of the settings

24:01.480 --> 24:08.000
But CS go on there and it was running like really fluidly and I was like does Steam sync the graphic settings?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.080
So I had to look at it and on Solus

24:10.080 --> 24:15.600
it was running on the high settings whereas I had to put it on the medium sentence because I was lagging on Ubuntu with the

24:15.800 --> 24:19.000
Ubuntu 1204 runtime that comes to Steam and there was a

24:19.640 --> 24:21.320
definite performance

24:21.320 --> 24:23.780
Increase just by using a newer runtime

24:23.840 --> 24:25.900
So it's not me saying that you know

24:25.900 --> 24:30.020
Like Solus magically makes it fast or anything like that because you know

24:30.020 --> 24:32.360
Then we'd have to have benchmarks and we'd have to have pissing contests

24:32.360 --> 24:39.120
I know that's right sure but just by having the newer updated stack like Steam ran infinitely better

24:39.120 --> 24:39.560
Yeah

24:39.560 --> 24:45.080
So I'm kind of hoping that other projects now adopt that philosophy and try and go for their own native updated

24:45.080 --> 24:48.040
Yeah, as somebody who's tested that myself, I completely agree

24:48.040 --> 24:52.440
I don't know. We see a lot of the updates from like Phyronix reviews and other things talking about graphics tech

24:52.440 --> 24:55.180
So it's like exciting to see those features in your hands. Yep. So

24:55.180 --> 25:00.380
So right now I see a wimpy in the chatroom says he's hiding his laptop running Solus

25:00.380 --> 25:04.700
So right now if I go download the Solus ISO and I install that version

25:04.700 --> 25:06.900
Will I effectively be on a rolling release immediately?

25:07.820 --> 25:11.020
Yeah, basically, but what I would do is wait until

25:11.860 --> 25:15.980
Sunday when 1.2.1 comes out. I know I'm always dropping bombshells

25:19.380 --> 25:24.620
So 1.2.1 is gonna come out on Sunday and the reason is that's got a couple of minor installer fixes as

25:24.620 --> 25:26.860
Well as full disk encryption and all that crap

25:28.140 --> 25:31.780
There was there was a tiny little bug which came up with two users

25:32.060 --> 25:36.220
One of them was funny enough with Softpedia who installed Solus on a Chromebook

25:36.220 --> 25:38.220
No, as you do. Yeah, sure, of course

25:38.820 --> 25:43.700
Yeah, as you do. Yeah, but there was a minor bug that was encountered on there that would crash the installer

25:43.700 --> 25:44.860
So that's since been fixed

25:44.860 --> 25:50.860
But yeah, it's basically gonna be on you're on this repo and we don't break you and you keep running Solus forever

25:50.860 --> 25:54.660
So once that's done we get to do the cool stuff like put in known 3.2

25:54.660 --> 25:59.740
Oh and you know update more of the graphical stack and all the core libraries. You hear that Fedora 24?

25:59.780 --> 26:01.780
You better get your act together

26:02.300 --> 26:04.300
All right, Solus is chasing you

26:05.180 --> 26:10.700
That Apollo is looking hungry for a new distro right now, you know, it's got that look in its eyes

26:10.700 --> 26:13.300
Well, thank you. I keep for stopping by and giving us an update on that. I

26:14.580 --> 26:16.580
Sounds like a very interesting development

26:16.580 --> 26:21.420
So I I want to do a little discussion with you guys about a problem

26:21.420 --> 26:25.220
I ran into just over the last couple of days. In fact, I'll give you the whole story

26:25.220 --> 26:30.620
I'll give you the whole like disappointing like you guys will totally feel my pain story

26:31.060 --> 26:34.820
And I have a feeling in that discussion digital oceans gonna come up

26:34.820 --> 26:41.300
So let's do the pluggy plug right now for digital ocean go over there and use the promo code do unplug to get a $10

26:41.300 --> 26:43.420
credit that's one word lowercase just

26:43.420 --> 26:49.860
Smoosh it all together do unplugged. It's a simple cloud hosting provider with their entire infrastructure built around Linux

26:50.340 --> 26:57.100
They use KVM for the virtualizer, which I mean, I personally think KVM is the best virtualizer out there. I

26:57.860 --> 27:00.660
Love KVM. I if I build my own virtual machines

27:00.660 --> 27:09.180
I use KVM and so they're checking two boxes right there with Linux and KVM and then the third box that they check is their entire

27:09.180 --> 27:13.460
Infrastructure is SSDs and then the fourth box that they check seriously

27:13.460 --> 27:15.900
I'd be happy with three of these things at this point so many boxes

27:15.900 --> 27:22.820
The fourth thing is they have great internet connections into these boxes and then there's a five. Yes. There's five things

27:23.020 --> 27:29.420
There's five things. They also have a great interface. Oh, there's six six. There's six things. Yeah

27:29.420 --> 27:31.420
Oh my gosh, I forgot about this

27:31.860 --> 27:35.580
They also have like this incredible API that oh the API

27:35.580 --> 27:39.580
We use on a daily basis here on Jupiter broadcasting to like control it with our chat room by but

27:40.060 --> 27:46.220
No, it couldn't be seven West. Well, I can have every operating system. Yeah, pretty much that you ever want to install

27:46.220 --> 27:49.700
I mean, they've got even even free BSD. Yeah, right and I guess I

27:50.460 --> 27:52.220
Guess there could be an eighth

27:52.220 --> 27:58.180
The really really good documentation like the stuff that gives that makes the arch wiki look like amateur hour

27:58.180 --> 28:00.820
And I love the arch wiki. We all do we all do

28:00.820 --> 28:08.100
Don't tell the people over at digital ocean that they're really great documentation would basically be applicable to any Linux installation because they might stop

28:08.100 --> 28:09.540
doing it

28:09.540 --> 28:12.420
Digital ocean calm use the promo code do one plug

28:13.620 --> 28:15.860
Smooch it all together and get a $10 credit

28:15.860 --> 28:20.020
You could try the $5 rig for two months for free or you could run a rig

28:20.020 --> 28:23.660
That's whatever spec you want and just use it hourly like, you know

28:24.620 --> 28:26.940
Spin it up create something and then destroy it

28:26.940 --> 28:32.900
The serious part about this is is like I joke around but one of my favorite things about digital ocean is you can spin up

28:32.900 --> 28:37.660
a rig instantaneously practically and you can have an entire application stack or a base rig and

28:38.220 --> 28:43.540
when you combine the ease of doing that with you know being able to base it on templates or previous images and

28:44.500 --> 28:52.220
The hourly pricing and our promo code it basically comes down to you can have incredible compute power up in the cloud

28:52.220 --> 28:57.660
As much as you want for like nothing for a while using our promo code deal unplugged and you support the show

28:57.780 --> 29:01.420
That keeps us going because the way they track this instead of us

29:01.940 --> 29:08.780
Collecting data on who watches the show and what parts of the show you watched and where you watched it from and what?

29:08.780 --> 29:14.180
Your age is and what your sex is and how much money you make and when's the last time you've heard Jupiter broadcasting?

29:14.180 --> 29:16.020
Ask you to take an audience survey

29:16.020 --> 29:19.020
When's the last time we don't do that? I don't want your data

29:19.020 --> 29:22.300
I just want your downloads and then when you use the promo code deal unplugged

29:22.300 --> 29:27.580
That's the only mechanism they have to track to know that it worked. That's the arrangement. We have there's no data sharing here

29:27.580 --> 29:30.660
There's no like stitcher like all the information kind of being shared

29:30.660 --> 29:36.840
You use the promo code deal unplugged that registers as a use over there that says hey our investment at Jupiter broadcasting is paying off

29:36.840 --> 29:41.140
That's the system you get a credit we get acknowledgement digital ocean gets a new customer

29:41.140 --> 29:45.300
It's a super slick system, and it doesn't involve a whole bunch of spying data

29:45.300 --> 29:51.100
I think that's pretty cool, so you get great product everybody wins digital ocean comm use the promo code deal unplugged

29:51.460 --> 29:55.140
And a big thank you digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program

29:56.300 --> 29:57.700
Okay, so I'm looking right here

29:57.700 --> 30:03.140
I got a net Eliza report high-end stuff here West and if you guys haven't heard of now

30:03.140 --> 30:09.100
Which you probably have because it's forever old you can get the ICSI net Eliza command-line client

30:09.100 --> 30:14.540
It's just so fun to say yeah, the real you know the real actual nice tool is an Android app. It's legitimately nice

30:14.540 --> 30:19.360
Oh, really. I love it, but they also have a Java applet that you can download just a jar

30:19.980 --> 30:27.200
Then run on the command line, and then it generates you a fairly impressive comprehensive report and what it revealed to me

30:27.740 --> 30:29.740
was

30:31.200 --> 30:37.860
That I was behind an HTTP and HTTPS proxy and also intercepting FTP connections

30:38.940 --> 30:43.460
Yeah, and it'll tell you this as well, and it does it by using a few different metrics

30:43.460 --> 30:45.900
But primarily they know what I'm connecting what IP

30:45.900 --> 30:49.860
I'm connecting from and what IP I'm connecting to and if there's something in between us

30:49.860 --> 30:52.120
So if the request originates for my IP

30:52.120 --> 30:56.500
But the actual connection they don't see it and that comes from a different IP then they know it's been proxied and they have

30:56.500 --> 31:03.660
A couple different tests to verify that they've also indicated that some of my DNS results are getting kind of mushed up in here

31:03.660 --> 31:07.100
Oh, no, just a popular websites like city. Yeah here. Yeah right here

31:07.100 --> 31:10.300
So six popular names have been have moderate anomalies

31:10.300 --> 31:15.420
We are unable to find a reverse name associated with the IP address provided by your ISPs DNS server

31:15.580 --> 31:20.900
Although we expected to find a name and it's for things like chase comm Wells Fargo comm

31:21.500 --> 31:23.100
yahoo.com

31:23.100 --> 31:30.180
Their DNN what it is, and I've done some additional testing after this is their DNS server my ISPs DNS server

31:31.140 --> 31:33.140
in some cases

31:33.140 --> 31:40.780
Has a here it is has a six thousand and one hundred millisecond response time to my DNS queries six

31:40.860 --> 31:46.000
Thousand millisecond response time to my DNS queries pretty suspicious. Yeah, it's bad bad bad

31:46.140 --> 31:50.820
So why is it so bad well let Chris tell you a story here ladies and gentlemen

31:51.820 --> 31:58.740
For many reasons some of which are economic. I live in an RV. I love it. I would not change a thing

31:58.740 --> 32:05.460
I love it. I live on the coast the road the west coast is beautiful. It sure is I live right there on the water

32:05.460 --> 32:07.460
I couldn't be happier about that

32:07.940 --> 32:10.800
And it's only possible because I live in an RV

32:11.660 --> 32:16.160
And I don't own the space. I just I have it for it's an RV thing anyways

32:17.180 --> 32:24.580
There is no way to get a data connection out there. There's no Comcast. There's no Verizon. There's no frontier

32:24.580 --> 32:30.720
There's no wire. That's gonna come to where I'm at the only data connection. I can get is over cellular

32:31.580 --> 32:33.380
You're like living in the future man

32:33.380 --> 32:38.620
It is a little it is a little like that in some ways because it's also like living in the past more

32:38.620 --> 32:41.140
Yeah, uh-huh in some ways. It's like wow look at me

32:41.140 --> 32:44.860
No wires everything's wireless all my media consumption everything

32:44.860 --> 32:50.280
I do is over is over a my fight connection and that does in some ways feel like this probably the way it's gonna go

32:50.280 --> 32:55.640
Down the road, but in other ways my fight connections, especially where I live are extremely unreliable

32:55.980 --> 33:00.180
There's only one provider out of all of the US providers in the area

33:00.180 --> 33:06.640
So where I live and you can look it up on anybody's coverage map is I live on the coast in La Conner Washington

33:07.380 --> 33:11.140
There's only about 900 of us there, so you can actually probably come find me pretty easily

33:11.740 --> 33:13.740
and there is

33:14.060 --> 33:17.340
Tribal land all around us and the tribes don't allow

33:17.340 --> 33:24.260
cellular tower installations I see there is however one state-owned island

33:25.140 --> 33:30.180
Where they have been able to install one AT&T tower, and that's your service

33:32.100 --> 33:34.100
And so

33:35.060 --> 33:38.380
On the island this is a particular particular situation

33:38.380 --> 33:43.000
I got into recently where I discovered there is a thing and I don't want to give too much information away

33:43.000 --> 33:48.500
But there's a thing such as grandfathered unlimited plans that you can purchase on eBay

33:49.620 --> 33:54.220
There's not a lot of them. They're getting expensive. I so I may know some people with yeah

33:54.220 --> 33:58.920
And when you purchase when you purchase one of these things you essentially

33:59.620 --> 34:06.980
You you adopt or you I guess sublease would be the better you sub rent if you will a or purchase if you have a lot

34:06.980 --> 34:08.700
of money a

34:08.700 --> 34:13.340
Unlimited AT&T account you're buying a contract or renting somebody in the car. Yeah, yeah

34:13.340 --> 34:19.920
And so I went that route as an experiment because for me data connectivity is pretty essential, so I've got

34:20.340 --> 34:25.460
I have every I have every provider because one of the nice things about ting who is a sponsor of ours

34:25.460 --> 34:30.580
Yeah, you get to I get CMA and GSM and and I don't have to worry about caps now

34:30.580 --> 34:34.900
I will have to spend more if I want to use a whole bunch of data, but I know right so that is

34:35.100 --> 34:37.260
Super nice, then I have a Verizon

34:37.260 --> 34:43.900
MiFi which is like like a like a like a five giga or something and they have like a no contract plan

34:43.900 --> 34:48.580
And that's the one I never use unless I have to because it's like the only Verizon in town

34:48.580 --> 34:54.020
That's I'm in Wyoming on highway 90 and the only person here is Verizon

34:54.060 --> 35:00.020
That's because this is literally something I drive I drives right so I'm like I just got back from Montana where there was

35:00.260 --> 35:05.220
When you go through the passes, there's just no connectivity and even though I have every cellular provider in the RV

35:05.220 --> 35:08.940
There's no connectivity so and and also

35:08.940 --> 35:12.060
I should say I should probably disclose the ting has provided me with a miFi

35:12.340 --> 35:15.720
That I have been I have been using for quote-unquote testing for a while now

35:16.140 --> 35:22.180
To in some ways legitimately test the ting network as I move around to get a true sense of what ting is like right?

35:22.180 --> 35:25.380
I mean Europe and as long as I don't go as long as I don't go crazy

35:25.380 --> 35:27.460
They don't they don't worry about the data on that line

35:27.960 --> 35:32.400
So that's nice. That's where I'm at is is only AT&T

35:32.400 --> 35:39.760
So I've gotten this old AT&T miFi this used AT&T miFi, and I've this is what I've been connecting the

35:40.360 --> 35:42.360
lady Jupiter Network to

35:42.560 --> 35:45.800
Be you know what outside the fire your main

35:46.400 --> 35:50.040
And I've recently so you remember that you remember that device. You got me that

35:50.560 --> 35:54.880
Was a firewall that I could connect the miFi to that's right

35:54.880 --> 35:59.040
Yeah, so about about two months ago when Noah was in town

35:59.600 --> 36:00.560
for

36:00.560 --> 36:03.920
last 10 year anniversary or whatever whenever whenever that was

36:05.160 --> 36:11.400
We upgraded that to a cradle point Wi-Fi access point. Oh wow that allows me to

36:12.080 --> 36:15.760
Who doesn't well it does a few interesting things I can connect my files to it

36:15.760 --> 36:20.600
And then it will share that miFi connection with the LAN I can connect it to another Wi-Fi network

36:20.600 --> 36:25.480
So if I repeat it so if I take lady Jupiter to an RV park that has Wi-Fi I can connect to that and then it

36:25.480 --> 36:29.960
Repeats it to my LAN and I can connect it to Ethernet and it will repeat that so it's really cool

36:29.960 --> 36:31.760
That is really neat, and so I got that set up

36:31.760 --> 36:34.400
It's all and I'm like wow this is a huge upgrade, and I have them

36:34.400 --> 36:40.720
I have a persistent LAN now which was hit or miss yeah, so now I always have a persistent LAN regardless of signal

36:40.720 --> 36:46.160
Which is really fantastic and it all runs off an inverter that runs all the time even if if lady

36:46.160 --> 36:51.080
Jups is disconnected from power those things run off of an inverter that's connected directly to my battery bank

36:51.080 --> 36:56.640
So my LAN is always online. It's like the house is a built-in UPS real network

36:56.640 --> 37:01.360
It's great, and that's amazing. I get the miFi. I get it all hooked up and

37:02.080 --> 37:04.000
I have negative

37:04.000 --> 37:07.040
114 DB signal and for those of you that maybe that's like

37:07.960 --> 37:09.960
Less than one bar one bar

37:10.520 --> 37:16.920
Negative 118 is no bars for where I'm at so one negative 114 DB is pushing it man that

37:16.920 --> 37:18.760
How do you like the edge network it were yeah?

37:18.760 --> 37:24.960
well actually it's a little better, but it was like it was 300 K down and about 96 kilobits up so

37:24.960 --> 37:31.680
Awful yeah, okay, and that was that was sort of the situation for a couple of months. No big deal

37:31.680 --> 37:35.400
I just went all offline on everything. Yeah, whatever you know what I just went

37:35.400 --> 37:41.440
I doubled down on cody and local media end up at the studio or other places sometimes you can studio has a hundred megabit down

37:41.440 --> 37:44.040
So that's fine, so that was my solution for a while

37:44.040 --> 37:50.120
But then I I started thinking about wanting to be able to do productions on the road in September

37:50.120 --> 37:52.120
I'm going to go to a linux conference

37:52.120 --> 37:58.040
and I'm taking lady Jupiter down there, and I want to be able to do shows from the road totally and

37:58.680 --> 38:03.360
That's when I started looking into a new product built for RVs called

38:03.600 --> 38:10.660
We boost RV and this does a 60 DB boost of all cellular network providers signal

38:11.000 --> 38:14.940
So it just increases your antenna size basically or it takes it

38:14.940 --> 38:22.380
It takes so say for so for example where I at my primary campsite where I'm parked I go from a hundred and negative

38:22.900 --> 38:27.140
114 negative 112 depending on the day signal to about negative

38:28.100 --> 38:29.940
6570

38:29.940 --> 38:36.380
Rhythms everyone remember it is it is a huge boost so I went from a so I went from on a on a good day

38:36.820 --> 38:38.820
600 K on a bad day

38:38.820 --> 38:44.940
196 KB you know like really bad to now I'm clocking six megabits down six megabits up wow

38:45.100 --> 38:48.580
And I went from a ping time of a real usability improve

38:48.580 --> 38:54.780
I went from a ping time of around three hundred and eighty milliseconds to thirty two milliseconds thirty two yeah

38:57.460 --> 39:03.740
By the way the studios ping time right now is not much better. It's twenty two point seven so Comcast is taking the crap right now

39:03.740 --> 39:10.260
So anyways the huge you so it's again. It's we boost RV

39:10.900 --> 39:15.780
It's extremely tricky to set up because the the antenna that receives the cellular signal

39:15.780 --> 39:15.980
Yeah

39:15.980 --> 39:22.420
And the internal antenna that boosts to your devices have to be far far enough apart that they don't pick each other up and just

39:22.420 --> 39:23.140
Create it yep

39:23.140 --> 39:28.140
And so that I got all that worked out and then I and so then it started to become a matter of well

39:28.140 --> 39:30.260
Why why now that I have six megabits?

39:30.260 --> 39:34.860
Why am I still getting horrible page load times? Why am I getting horrible?

39:34.860 --> 39:38.580
So I I started looking at so I set up a local DNS server

39:38.580 --> 39:41.680
Yeah, of course naturally so I set up a little did you go with I said

39:41.680 --> 39:45.020
Oh, I just set all up on the on the cradle point. Oh nice. Oh wow yeah

39:45.020 --> 39:49.620
Yeah, once you go into advanced mode. It has a DNS server all that kind of stuff and so that was super easy

39:50.660 --> 39:53.860
Then I started running netalyzer and so again

39:53.860 --> 39:58.300
I'll have a link to netalyzer you can run it on your linux rig if you have Java or you can run on Android

39:58.300 --> 40:00.300
and again, it's Java and

40:00.860 --> 40:08.380
It clearly showed it clearly showed that I was behind a proxy server and because this is a my fight connection on AT&T

40:08.700 --> 40:13.820
To me it makes sense that they would probably be proxying people's traffic the problem

40:13.820 --> 40:16.040
There's a lot of like carrier grade net that goes on with yes

40:16.060 --> 40:20.980
Cellular stuff and the problem is is I do not like AT&T as a company

40:20.980 --> 40:25.860
I do not trust AT&T and I definitely have a reseller of AT&T is my primary phone

40:25.860 --> 40:29.860
So I have experienced exactly the same thing and I don't want AT&T knowing everywhere

40:29.860 --> 40:33.340
I go on the web absolutely not especially because honestly the super cookie thing

40:33.340 --> 40:40.220
Yeah, and and honestly I search for some disturbing stuff for unfiltered like I don't really want that associated with who I am as a person

40:40.220 --> 40:42.860
Because it's does it is not representative of business

40:42.860 --> 40:47.860
It's a research thing and it's not representative of who I of who I am and so but they have no idea like boy

40:47.860 --> 40:51.060
He sure looks up a lot of things about Vladimir Putin like no. I don't

40:51.060 --> 40:54.900
I don't have a thing for Putin. I mean yeah, I love that he wrestles bears with his shirt off

40:56.060 --> 41:02.780
But that's not a thing of mine, and I really want to come up with a solution that is super Linux friendly that

41:03.420 --> 41:09.140
Avoids this problem now. It doesn't have to be network level if I could just do it on my laptop and my lady's laptop

41:09.140 --> 41:12.740
Okay, yeah, but so she's running Matei, and I'm running gnome

41:12.740 --> 41:16.960
I'd like to have and I would love to have something to integrate some with the desktop environment if possible

41:16.960 --> 41:23.320
So for her it's just an easy toggle on toggle off like it would be if she had a Mac or right god forbid a Windows box

41:23.960 --> 41:27.560
I'm sorry was Chris. You're scaring everyone. I'm sorry was

41:28.120 --> 41:33.000
And I I was I got a few suggestions. I've got IPV IP VPN

41:33.000 --> 41:39.100
I've gotten private interface and of course tink has been a topic before oh right, but the solution the problem

41:39.100 --> 41:44.080
I'm trying to solve in this particular case is I want something that is as fast as possible

41:44.080 --> 41:51.320
I just want to tunnel around my ISP as much as possible and the other thing that's particularly tricky is I think sometimes like the my

41:51.320 --> 41:52.040
Phi

41:52.040 --> 41:57.440
When I go to like look up where my IP is or when things try to do can we access your location in my browser?

41:57.480 --> 42:04.200
They show that I'm in Dallas when I'm in Washington mm-hmm, so it I don't know where I've seen that as well

42:04.200 --> 42:09.640
I don't know how they're routing that it might be one horrendous gnat that we're all behind

42:09.640 --> 42:12.640
I don't know, but I would like something that is

42:12.640 --> 42:15.640
Is performant yeah, that is easy to?

42:16.440 --> 42:21.640
Enable and also definite points for something that's easy to set up because I try out so many different distros

42:21.640 --> 42:25.920
And then I take them home. I don't want to have to like load a kernel module to do like

42:27.080 --> 42:30.640
What's the new one? We just talked about wire guard wire guard or I you know?

42:30.640 --> 42:32.360
I don't want to have to install a whole bunch of pack

42:32.360 --> 42:33.040
I mean I could do it

42:33.040 --> 42:37.680
But it needs to be something that's fairly straightforward to get going on different distros and whatnot to if possible

42:37.680 --> 42:43.480
I don't know West does anything come to mind for you. I mean I've used a few different like private vendor VPN providers

42:43.480 --> 42:47.200
Tor guard comes to mind private internet access is one that's in the news a lot and talked about and they have

42:47.560 --> 42:50.680
Fairly good cipher suite selection and that kind of thing

42:50.680 --> 42:57.320
I do I know I've had some friends playing with like getting that all integrated with network manager in no particular

42:57.320 --> 43:03.400
You know like having the the open VPN files open VPN probably should be pretty reasonable performance obviously

43:03.400 --> 43:08.480
There's a lot of like that was sort of one of the things I was thinking about was open VPN on a digital ocean droplets

43:08.560 --> 43:14.200
but at the same time I don't want to be I don't want to be in the position where I'm here at work and

43:14.440 --> 43:19.360
Hadid is at home and all of a sudden VPN is not working and now I need to go troubleshoot an installation

43:19.360 --> 43:21.680
So that's not that's not huge on my list

43:21.680 --> 43:26.500
But there are I have seen some scripts out there that will you can kind of get it like

43:26.760 --> 43:28.720
Where it'll when you want to use the VPN?

43:28.720 --> 43:34.200
I mean you'd have to make like a gooey a desktop file or something for her maybe but for you if you could run a

43:34.200 --> 43:36.200
Script it could spin up a droplet

43:36.400 --> 43:40.960
Install everything provision it start everything so you might have a little bit more of like it might have a delay

43:40.960 --> 43:44.880
But it would be more reproducible and then turning it off and on again might actually fix it

43:45.000 --> 43:47.640
So let's see tech may have links to a digital ocean

43:48.280 --> 43:51.360
Tutorial on setting up a basic VPN on a boot to 14 of course

43:51.360 --> 43:55.000
There's also a fair number of options SSH will be less efficient of course

43:55.000 --> 44:01.400
but there's both the socks proxy and using it as a ton and so nobody wants to say go with something like

44:01.640 --> 44:06.840
Tunnel bear or I mean I will say I I use tour guard just for some so tour guard is not

44:07.640 --> 44:11.840
Thing they're just using the name tour. Yeah, I think they also like they have servers that allow torrents

44:11.840 --> 44:16.360
Oh, oh, oh well, okay, so yeah, okay, so this is obviously not the main concern here

44:16.560 --> 44:19.640
So anonymous VPN service, so you're not gonna say they're the best

44:19.640 --> 44:22.240
I've been grandfathered in on like a really good deal

44:22.240 --> 44:25.400
So I pay like two dollars and fifty cents a month or less or something okay?

44:26.160 --> 44:29.600
They have a very number of services private internet access is fairly well-reviewed

44:29.700 --> 44:34.760
They just had a big thing in Russia where they're pulling out of Russia because Russia is required has a new law requiring them

44:34.760 --> 44:38.520
To keep logs, so they're shutting down their rush and say they don't do that's hard to audit

44:38.520 --> 44:40.920
I know on the our Linux subreddit

44:40.920 --> 44:47.560
They've had it posted a few times like a someone has made a great list and review of these VPN services and obviously for the VPN

44:47.560 --> 44:50.280
Services what you're really paying for is like hiding amongst the crowd

44:50.280 --> 44:55.180
otherwise and and you know using their servers in different countries otherwise if you're just concerned about

44:55.840 --> 45:00.240
Proxying past your immediate ISP DigitalOcean works just fine for that too. Hmm

45:00.960 --> 45:07.880
So I've seen Nord VPN and IP vanish does anybody in the mumble room have any suggestions for either a DIY or DIY or?

45:08.400 --> 45:10.400
a service that they

45:10.520 --> 45:12.520
trust and like

45:12.840 --> 45:18.800
It's pretty scary to realize when you're being you know yeah, that's the ensuring trust hard. Yeah

45:18.800 --> 45:20.360
I

45:20.360 --> 45:23.120
Definitely will see I was hoping to hear from somebody who's like yes

45:23.120 --> 45:24.880
I like these people and yes

45:24.880 --> 45:31.120
they they acknowledge that Linux exists and like so I looked into like for example TunnelBear because that's when I've seen advertised on YouTube and

45:31.760 --> 45:37.280
The thing about TunnelBear is like you feel like they begrudgingly support Linux like they kind of I guess what kind of support

45:37.280 --> 45:41.240
I know a lot of them have their own custom clients, but I would like have like an open VPN

45:41.240 --> 45:43.600
That's that's true as long as they do

45:43.600 --> 45:48.000
I would love this here's what I really want from that is I want to link somebody something here read this

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
That's really what I want

45:51.960 --> 45:54.280
Which is what I don't really have if I roll myself either

45:55.400 --> 46:01.040
You're the support person and then and then the I guess the the other question is is am I going about this all wrong?

46:01.040 --> 46:03.040
Should I just not worry about it? I?

46:03.480 --> 46:06.320
Feel like maybe even from a performance standpoint. I should worry about it

46:06.320 --> 46:10.760
You know even if it's not from a data so if you're at least especially if what those DNS numbers that you're talking

46:10.760 --> 46:13.320
Yeah, and I fixed that by just using my own local DNS

46:13.320 --> 46:17.880
But you know I didn't even think about the fact that the router would just pass on the DNS from the eye whoever

46:17.880 --> 46:22.440
Wants to use their is peace DNS right disgusting. Yeah, there's open VPNs

46:23.320 --> 46:25.320
AWS image count

46:26.880 --> 46:32.360
So this is an instance that I would run on AWS that would probably haul balls

46:34.280 --> 46:42.080
Hmm well their blessed image now look at Rekha here Rekha is also linking to viper VPN who I've heard of before

46:42.080 --> 46:48.160
From golden from golden frog calm, and it's their golden frog support here it talks about

46:49.000 --> 46:54.680
Using Ubuntu, and I like that like they tell you they tell you what packages to install so that's doable because then

46:55.840 --> 47:00.440
Yeah, I'm gonna have to play with this and maybe I could I'm gonna have to see maybe people know a good review somewhere

47:00.440 --> 47:05.880
They reviews they reviewers they trust from there from like a security and performance template because that's the other thing yeah

47:05.880 --> 47:07.600
You can read reviews about these things

47:07.600 --> 47:12.720
And I don't really care if the VPN service provider knows what I'm doing. I don't really care about that

47:12.720 --> 47:19.680
No, I what I really really care about is performance, and I would like the fundamental technology to be sound yeah, right right

47:19.680 --> 47:23.280
I don't like you want cyphers that aren't ten years old you want mm-hmm

47:23.280 --> 47:27.840
Yeah, and it's maybe they're maybe the best and maybe it's worth the exercise of setting it up myself

47:27.840 --> 47:31.040
I just you know I've run VPN service before in the past

47:31.040 --> 47:33.760
But they were friend users where I had to constantly reset password

47:33.760 --> 47:38.800
I will say digital ocean or some of the other ones have some exciting possibilities where you could have a step where it pings some

47:38.800 --> 47:44.000
Of their test servers or DC's and figures out what the best place to spin up your new VPN proxy is

47:44.800 --> 47:48.000
Which could be particularly good from a Wi-Fi right right the?

47:49.440 --> 47:53.040
Private Internet access has some Linux support as compatibility things

47:53.040 --> 47:58.080
But they also have a thing where you can set it up where DDWRT uses their stuff. Yeah, that'd be nice

47:58.080 --> 48:04.080
Network level does make it simpler especially if you know that you're always being tracked. That's true the other nice thing about that is then

48:04.080 --> 48:09.600
I don't ever have to worry about distribution reloads or work and if it breaks you're fixing it for yourself. Just as much as

48:12.160 --> 48:16.640
Huh yeah, that's just the problem is that I don't I look through the cradle point software

48:16.640 --> 48:20.000
And I didn't see anything that talked about VPN so support

48:20.000 --> 48:24.800
So I would have to run a separate device and probably put it in between and right and to give you an idea

48:24.800 --> 48:28.320
All of this is running under my dinette, which is also

48:29.120 --> 48:33.280
means it's in a very small tight space because they're under they're under benches if it net and you're

48:34.160 --> 48:39.280
Rolling home here, but the awesome thing is is if you came over to the

48:39.920 --> 48:43.520
RV right now you would have no idea that I'm doing this because I ran everything

48:44.080 --> 48:48.640
I brought the wiring in through where the slides at and it goes right up into the into the benches

48:48.640 --> 48:51.120
And so you can't see any of the oh, that's so cool

48:51.120 --> 48:56.000
Which when you think about the limited counter space and whatnot in an RV that is such a win to have

48:56.000 --> 49:01.040
I just I have I have extremely powerful Wi-Fi because it's it's it's a 40. It's 47 feet long

49:01.040 --> 49:07.360
So our 37 feet long so it doesn't it it's not like you need the craziest Wi-Fi router ever pretty reasonable

49:07.840 --> 49:11.520
Everywhere in everywhere in my campsite. I'm on Wi-Fi which is great

49:11.520 --> 49:15.120
That is awesome because I don't have cell signal out there so that be able to be on Wi-Fi

49:15.680 --> 49:18.960
Through the one unlimited AT&T. My fight thing is perfect

49:18.960 --> 49:24.960
And this is really the last little bit is this and I think also blog they also are in apparently intercepting FTP connections

49:25.040 --> 49:28.400
They don't mess with VPN or SSH though

49:29.040 --> 49:35.120
You know, I've seen some stuff on on AT&T stuff weird stuff too. Like I was playing with one of those. What's that?

49:35.920 --> 49:37.440
like separate

49:37.440 --> 49:40.880
Terminal for Android that do you know what I'm talking about? No

49:41.200 --> 49:44.240
No, but I probably have used it like way back in the day termux

49:44.240 --> 49:49.040
That's what it's called. Okay, and they have their own repos and stuff so you can install it without root and have like without having

49:49.040 --> 49:51.440
Installed I like that West we can talk about it

49:51.440 --> 49:57.040
But I noticed that like over just the cell signal I couldn't hit the repos and once IVP end up boom

49:57.040 --> 50:03.360
No problem download it instantly. So it's like you really you really can't trust the major wireless carriers to provide you with the kind of

50:03.920 --> 50:07.920
Pure uplink you would get from like a business grade or you know when you're running your own BGP

50:09.680 --> 50:12.640
I sad to say I don't think I'm gonna be able to do that

50:12.640 --> 50:14.640
I sad to say I don't think I'm I don't know

50:14.720 --> 50:16.720
I don't think I don't think I've come to a solution

50:16.960 --> 50:19.920
I don't know if I have anybody in the mummer room any other thoughts before we move on?

50:20.400 --> 50:22.400
I like that some good suggestions in the chat room

50:23.200 --> 50:28.640
Chris Lael had a question regarding your issue with your ISP. Oh, what was it? I didn't see it

50:28.640 --> 50:30.720
Sorry, I think it went by before I got a chance to catch it

50:31.280 --> 50:33.280
No, I just was talking to

50:34.220 --> 50:38.160
WW and SX for that. Um, my question is

50:38.160 --> 50:42.560
Well, if I understand what you're trying to do is you're trying to get around the

50:44.080 --> 50:47.360
Bandwidth block that your ISP is doing. Is that correct?

50:47.440 --> 50:49.760
It's not so much that I wouldn't call it a bandwidth block

50:50.000 --> 50:54.320
I would say that it would appear that the proxy server itself is in

50:54.940 --> 50:58.640
Introducing a certain amount of additional load time and latency

50:58.880 --> 51:02.640
And I just don't like them tracking and watching everywhere I go and doing their soup

51:02.640 --> 51:10.080
I would also I would I would presume that's where the super cookie injection happens as well. Yeah as you leave their network. Yeah

51:10.800 --> 51:12.080
All right. So

51:12.080 --> 51:14.080
When I was in my networking class

51:14.240 --> 51:19.040
This is the question I had for my teacher and maybe this applies to you and maybe it doesn't

51:19.520 --> 51:25.440
As I understand it what ISPs do is they get a block of addresses and they have a certain amount of bandwidth

51:26.480 --> 51:28.320
that they can

51:28.320 --> 51:30.480
Divvy out to those that block

51:30.480 --> 51:32.480
and so

51:32.800 --> 51:40.240
I'm not sure if what you're trying to do is getting around that divvying or if I would think if there's any if there's any

51:40.380 --> 51:43.520
Bandwidth controls that's going to be at a much lower level

51:43.920 --> 51:47.360
Uh, that's not happening at the proxy level. That's at the proxy level

51:47.440 --> 51:50.720
That's a protocol level application layer thing where you're looking at the individual

51:50.800 --> 51:55.360
HTTP connections and traffic and the images and the and the web page is being sent back

51:55.680 --> 51:58.160
Um, and in the cases of an HTTPS proxy

51:58.160 --> 52:02.640
Uh, you may in some cases actually have like some sort of way

52:03.120 --> 52:08.080
You know corporate proxy servers do this too where they they actually have a signed certificate where they can

52:08.400 --> 52:12.880
Be a man in the middle for HTTPS traffic or maybe they're just passing it on who knows

52:13.600 --> 52:19.840
But if they're actually doing any kind of throttling or quality of service control that's going to be happening at the network level

52:20.080 --> 52:22.080
That's going to be happening, you know, probably

52:22.160 --> 52:25.040
And I know this for a fact actually based on conversations

52:25.040 --> 52:28.720
I've had that can even actually happen at the individual cell site level and

52:29.040 --> 52:35.280
That doesn't happen at the centralized proxy server which appears to be in dallas from from what I can tell but what it does mean is

52:35.760 --> 52:42.900
Where performance does become a factor is instead of my HTTP traffic going to directly to the end destination

52:43.520 --> 52:48.800
It is going through a data center in dallas first and the problem is is any any

52:48.800 --> 52:55.780
Performance issues in but yeah, and they're and every stop of the route every hop of that trace route

52:55.860 --> 53:02.260
Where you could work between me and that proxy server could be a potential point of slow down performance issues increase latency

53:02.420 --> 53:06.660
And you know that they're running it through some sort of edge box that's doing processing tracking index

53:06.900 --> 53:08.900
So like they're actually they're doing image

53:09.060 --> 53:12.580
They're looking at the packets. Yeah, you just want them to pass it through like a dump pipe, right?

53:12.580 --> 53:17.620
And so what I want to do with a VPN is I just I just want to give my my my web traffic

53:17.620 --> 53:23.140
a clear path to the end VPN point and then out to the web from there which in

53:23.940 --> 53:28.940
Hopefully would be a quicker setter shorter set of routes because when you do non HTTP traffic

53:28.940 --> 53:34.900
You don't go down to Dallas. So that's my hope. I've also had pretty good experience with I don't know about necessarily on

53:36.180 --> 53:40.340
Cellular I haven't tried it there but on like Comcast or other like commodity home connections

53:40.340 --> 53:45.060
Sure, where all I'll just use SSH with as a layer 3 device making a ton device

53:45.060 --> 53:51.460
To a do droplet that I spin up. Hmm, and I have I have several machines in Europe that sometimes I want to sync larger files

53:51.460 --> 53:53.460
between let's just say and

53:53.420 --> 53:56.780
I don't know if it's just congestion more at my local level

53:56.860 --> 54:02.720
But even just proxying to like a droplet in San Fran and then using their pipe to Europe

54:02.720 --> 54:08.940
I can all max out Mike my local connection. No problem where I'm pulling like two megs down. Otherwise, so yeah

54:08.940 --> 54:10.940
I've run into this too. I run that same thing

54:10.940 --> 54:17.180
You do you can maybe benefit too from other providers better connections to other areas once you've gotten out of your local area

54:17.180 --> 54:23.700
Yeah, well interesting. Okay. So if you have suggestions if you have ideas Linux action show dot reddit dot-com or

54:24.340 --> 54:28.860
Tweet me at Chris Elias if you just want to link me to a service you use and trust now

54:28.860 --> 54:30.780
I would love that it's just one less thing

54:30.780 --> 54:35.900
I have one of my goals in the in the any Rover incarnation that I have and this one

54:35.900 --> 54:37.740
I hope to be the most teched out ever is

54:37.740 --> 54:43.460
Even though I want I want to have like crazy cool stuff in there. I only want to be

54:44.580 --> 54:49.540
managing and installing stuff that's really necessary if I can use if I can use something because

54:49.780 --> 54:55.500
The content of my data is not the paramount issue here. It's a consideration, but it's not the paramount issue

54:55.500 --> 55:01.220
I feel like it does open it up to potentially using a service provider because I'm just not super concerned about that aspect

55:01.220 --> 55:05.380
Yeah, right. I'm not looking at kid porn or something. Yeah anonymity is not the major concern

55:05.380 --> 55:10.220
We just want to get around your local ISP, you know, and it sucks to even have to worry about it

55:10.220 --> 55:14.020
It's 2016 and these practices should have gone out in the 90s

55:14.020 --> 55:19.460
and if you want to have if you want to just break away from this and you want a service provider who just wants to

55:19.460 --> 55:22.420
Make mobile simple and give you a data pipe check out ting

55:22.420 --> 55:28.100
If I go to linux dot ting comm when I hit the road and my ting my my fi I activate that thing

55:28.100 --> 55:30.100
I've got the netgear ting my fi and

55:30.180 --> 55:35.340
The thing I love about that son of a gun is it's got an LCD screen right on the front and before I got that

55:35.340 --> 55:37.620
I was like, oh, that's a gimmick. What a waste of battery

55:37.620 --> 55:41.420
Well, first of all turns off right away and second of all the thing has a ridiculous battery

55:41.420 --> 55:45.740
The thing has a bigger battery than the thing has such a big battery. You can actually charge other devices with it

55:45.740 --> 55:47.700
that's how big the battery is and

55:47.700 --> 55:49.180
the

55:49.180 --> 55:53.900
LCD screen gives you real-time data usage right there on the my screen

55:53.900 --> 55:59.340
Awesome, very nice when you have three four five six devices pulling data off this thing super nice

55:59.340 --> 56:06.560
Plus gives you a list of all of the Wi-Fi clients ting is mobile that makes sense. It's no contract. It's no early termination fee

56:06.820 --> 56:10.180
The arrangement is you just pay for what you use. So for me

56:11.020 --> 56:14.900
This works out pretty well when I go on the road. I do end up using more data on my phone

56:14.900 --> 56:18.660
I do end up making more calls and I don't really change my texting at all

56:19.500 --> 56:23.020
and so the month of July might be

56:23.020 --> 56:29.420
One of my more expensive ting months. It might actually be like a fifty five month fifty five dollar sixty dollar bill possibly

56:29.420 --> 56:31.260
That's what three phones, you know

56:31.260 --> 56:35.340
That's traveling from Washington to Montana and back for eight days like that that's gonna happen

56:35.340 --> 56:38.580
Yep, the rest of the year my ting bill is like thirty bucks

56:39.220 --> 56:44.340
And I mean it's just there's nothing that beats that so ting has a savings calculator you go in there you put in your information

56:44.340 --> 56:48.140
See how much you would save try them out. See if you're that's the litmus test. See if you're a good fit

56:48.140 --> 56:52.140
It really feels like wireless for adults, you know, it's yeah. Yeah, of course

56:52.140 --> 56:56.780
I want to tether yeah, and I don't mind I you know when you're on Wi-Fi you use it and we're like, yes

56:56.780 --> 57:00.140
I used your service. I'll pay you the fair market rate for your service

57:00.140 --> 57:06.300
And for those of us who really kind of get sick and tired of the whole OEM holding back the updates paradigm

57:06.300 --> 57:11.420
and like especially when you follow tech news and you know that there's crazy exploits out there and there's some of these things are just

57:11.420 --> 57:13.420
running kernels full of holes and

57:13.820 --> 57:18.380
That kind of stuff eats away at you when you're a tech savvy user that one of the things that's great about ting is

57:18.380 --> 57:25.580
They have there's no incentive structure in their business to withhold updates to get in that to even to even get in that position

57:25.580 --> 57:30.140
So one of the things I I think the sweet spot is now you get a Nexus device

57:30.140 --> 57:35.540
Yes, they put the 6p in the 5x on sale just about every other week. The 6p is on sale again right now on that

57:35.540 --> 57:37.540
Yeah, I'm prime day. Yeah

57:37.540 --> 57:43.660
It's like a hundred and it's like 150 bucks or something and the 6p was like 400. Yeah, it's just check them out

57:43.660 --> 57:48.780
So you get you get you get one of the Nexus devices either one still a good phone and you yeah

57:48.780 --> 57:53.460
Maybe it doesn't have edge screens or something, but it is a fully up-to-date

57:53.460 --> 57:59.100
Monthly updated Android device Android and it's you put it on the ting network. They don't have any contracts

57:59.100 --> 58:04.140
There's no locking of the phones. Nothing like that. They have GSM and CDMA and I just threw a link

58:04.140 --> 58:10.380
Their GSM SIM cards are on sale right now one dollar one dollar. I'm buying I'm gonna buy. I'm gonna buy like ten

58:10.380 --> 58:16.700
I should probably tell Noah. Yeah, actually. Yeah, if you have telegram on that I will you should tell him because you'll buy a whole batch

58:17.340 --> 58:21.340
Because it's ridiculous because you can hold on to those SIM cards and then put them in when you're ready and then you just pay for

58:21.340 --> 58:23.940
What you use no contract just start by going to the linux.ting.com

58:24.940 --> 58:28.540
That gets you $25 in service credits if you buy one of those $1 sims

58:28.660 --> 58:34.220
So then so then you have $25 of service credit, which is that's great. Yep

58:34.940 --> 58:40.340
That's gonna get you more through more than like for a month like and and then if you want to buy a device instead

58:40.340 --> 58:45.780
They'll give you $25 off the device. Then you just get the device from Ting. They have great dashboard great customer service

58:45.780 --> 58:52.240
You can talk to human beings. They're a cool company and they're backed by two cows. So you can't you just can't lose check them out

58:52.240 --> 58:54.240
linux.ting.com

58:55.020 --> 58:56.860
All right, so

58:56.860 --> 59:00.780
There's one story we have to talk about one more update. We haven't even gotten to the main show yet

59:00.780 --> 59:06.780
This is what's happening. Jeez, man, some of the some of the tech talk today yesterday 50 minutes long

59:06.780 --> 59:11.540
Whoa, that's unheard of I did tell it is worth listening to though. There is a story in there

59:11.540 --> 59:17.940
There was a major technical snafu that happened to me as a result of production ongoing in the studio

59:17.940 --> 59:21.620
I was gone that I did not expect. Oh, man. I share that story. It's

59:22.300 --> 59:26.620
Embarrassing and it was super confusing. There's no way I could have ever predicted it

59:26.620 --> 59:29.520
I don't think I could have ever foreseen the issue and I

59:29.700 --> 59:35.580
Don't think I could have trouble shot or resolved it any faster than I did and there was no way for Noah to know

59:35.580 --> 59:37.260
What was happening?

59:37.260 --> 59:40.340
Yeah nightmares, so I tell that story in tech talk today yesterday

59:40.340 --> 59:46.960
So let's talk about a story that we're all telling each other before the show started. You can now run the unity desktop

59:48.420 --> 59:50.420
on Windows 10

59:51.180 --> 59:53.180
Thanks to that bash on a boon to business

59:53.700 --> 59:57.900
What is happening my life as I know it is upside down

59:58.380 --> 01:00:01.820
Github user Guerrera 24 of course has managed to achieve this

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:05.840
After doing all sorts of tricks with compass config settings manager and all that goodness

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:14.060
He managed to run Ubuntu 1404 LTS with the Windows X server environment and then the unity desktop environment on top of that

01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:20.760
There you go and then later because that wasn't good enough

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:27.580
Also got X FCE running on top nice. So the only question I have is wimpy

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:31.940
How long until Matei is running on Windows 10? I?

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:38.800
Will have to be a community endeavor because I will never run Windows 10. Personally. I don't know

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:42.100
I hear it's really taken off

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:50.420
Also piggyback on Windows convergence and you just run an Ubuntu on your Windows phone now and boom convergence as well done problem solved

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:57.900
Huh? Yeah. Okay. I do wonder though. Like is this really fun like opening up? Are we gonna see like less of the Macbook Unix?

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:02.900
Developer grace because now instead of getting the weird OS X older freeBSD user land

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:10.520
You can run Windows and have Outlook and Adobe and then also a real Linux, you know environment to work with you know

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:14.380
I think maybe I can't remember was daredevil and who was saying before the show

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:18.860
There this really is going to be one of the easiest ways to install Linux software

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:24.300
It really is going because there will be people who do all of the legwork all of the esoteric little

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:29.940
Hacks that you have to do and they'll package it all up in some sort of MSI or something and you'll be able to install

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:32.940
I bet you they'll be like vagrant support and like all kinds of stuff

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:35.740
Damn it was

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:41.700
We can run mumble in Ubuntu on you know, the Windows kernel right here

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:45.380
I'll tell you what the OS it surely was ten years ago

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:50.740
I saw Mac users that were attempting to run GIMP on Mac OS with X Windows on Mac OS

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:56.500
And now Apple doesn't even ship X 11 right back anymore. I think I think they'll try it, but it's such a jarring

01:01:56.500 --> 01:02:00.820
Well, I don't know. I don't know. I shouldn't I shouldn't I to me

01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:06.620
It feels like it's such a mishmash jarring difference that if you really want that as those tools you just run the Linux desktop

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:11.980
That's true, but you do get like you get Python you get Ruby the the shell even if it's

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:16.780
Dated and you don't get the nice like, you know have command-line arguments any which way you want

01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:20.900
You can run a lot of the basic like deployment tools. I'll tell you what

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:24.940
I'll tell you what it does do I think and maybe Rekai would be a person to ask is

01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:27.500
Rekai and does it does it make you?

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:34.260
Want to run Windows 10? So yeah Rekai is he's a he's a multi OS user

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:40.580
He he'll run them all but I would say his daily driver is the one that has his Steam library and game library

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:44.300
And that's his Windows 7 desktop, and he's sworn off Windows 8 sworn off Windows 10

01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:50.780
But eventually, you know every Windows 7 user realizes they will have ability

01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:54.060
It's that or abandon it and when you look at this and you go well shit

01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.900
I Rekai is he likes to play with Linux tools and software too

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:01.100
And I you got to think this makes it a little more appealing to switch to Windows 10

01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:08.740
So what I think it really does is it just sort of greases the ramp on to Windows 10 for more technical Windows users and

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:14.620
That even that kind of pisses me off because I think they would make good Linux can they would make a deal on its candidates

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:21.060
Yeah, so Rekai says in a way. Yes, it'd probably make developing Jboss Ruby stuff easy, right and the utility of it is just

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:26.380
infectious dammit, and I mean and then and it just it's just unfortunate because then

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:30.460
We fall back on the philosophy, you know, it's less of like look at what it can do

01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:35.860
Because if you can use a Windows desktop to do 90% of what a Linux desktop you and not in the same way and not

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:39.380
With the same and it's not that the following back on the philosophy is bad. No, it's not

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:43.500
It's that the philosophy only speaks to a niche of the nation exactly exactly

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:47.580
Yeah, and then and when you're when you're trying to sell to somebody who's got to get some work done

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:52.620
The selling on the philosophy could be particularly I don't care. I just I have to get the work done

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:58.260
By Tuesday. Yeah. Yeah, so let's feel better about Linux. Oh, yes, you guys okay good

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:04.100
So there's some pretty cool technologies coming to the Linux. I'd say let's just call it the AV stack in Linux

01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:10.180
Yeah, we all are users of pulse audio and most of us that we like it or not. Yeah, and

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:15.620
And also G streamer even a lot of KD users are G streamer users. So let's start with pulse audio

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:19.140
There's something pretty damn cool that could make future podcast users

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:25.020
Let's start with pulse audio. There's something pretty damn cool that could make future podcasts much better coming to pulse audio

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:30.020
So get get excited for all you podcast listeners out there that listen any Linux podcasts

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:35.140
That sound like they have crap audio because beamforming in pulse is coming to pulse audio

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:41.380
Now you might think of beamforming as a Wi-Fi technology, right? That's what we hear about most of it, especially in the newer standard

01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:44.840
Yeah, it's a concept used in various aspects of signal processing including radio waves

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:51.080
But in this post they're talking about using it in audio the basic idea is that you have a number of microphones or a mic

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:57.880
Array in some known arrangement. It isn't it is then possible to point or steer the array in a particular direction

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:04.760
So sounds coming from that direction are made louder while sounds from other directions are rendered softer

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:09.380
Now practically speaking you could really see the value of this on a laptop

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:11.780
It doesn't have to be some big sophisticated mic array

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:16.540
For example, you might want to focus a mic on the person who's speaking on a laptop

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:20.680
Say you had a laptop microphone and you had something like the Logitech

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:25.580
930 here which or or c920 perhaps or 920 C

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:31.660
Super popular webcam one of the greatest I think also on sale on Prime Day. Oh really?

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:35.580
At least I saw some 920s on this is a that's a great webcam that works great with Linux

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.580
if you guys want to get it you should you should check it out and

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:43.340
And the that webcam has two microphones and in some situations like under Windows

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:50.380
It uses some Logitech software to actually use one microphone to listen to background noise and one microphone to listen to your face

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:53.380
I was about to say that's a great way to think about how this technology works

01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:57.940
Like if you have you know microphones around the edge, you can you know that that certain sounds hitting those. Mm-hmm

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:01.000
You really want to subtract and that's just like certain high-end

01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:05.380
Android devices do that for your calls the iPhones been doing that for years with your calls

01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:08.660
They have multiple microphones and they use that to isolate your voice now

01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:12.660
You could you know in a more sophisticated setup you could take advantage of a much wider array of mics

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:16.320
Right, but this is something that they're working on in the next version of pulse audio

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:23.260
That could be just as applicable to anybody that has a laptop that could make the pulse audio underlying software

01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:31.020
Be able to focus on your mouth and and and cut out some of that background extra sound and warbles and all that

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.740
especially when it's like

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:36.700
You know, you really go from a situation where it's like you have one mic or you have three mics and right now it

01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:38.700
Doesn't matter. Yeah

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:44.180
Six months when this is pushed to our laptops that you could have a noticeable difference in the sound quality

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:46.420
Yeah, I'm really excited about it because it you know

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:51.300
It could help contributors great pictures here. And if you follow the other link, he has a he has another article

01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:57.500
He links to like labbookpages.co.uk. They've got graphs. They've got diagrams. They've got some C programs

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.580
You can compile and run yourself. It's really cool

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:06.500
this is one of the geeky is and coolest post and it it really helps you appreciate the amount of knowledge and

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:12.660
Research that these developers have to do that have been solving real problem and it has nothing to do with actually writing code other than it

01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:20.260
Helps you design the the right code. In fact along those same lines this next update is another perfect example where they have they've done scientific

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:25.060
Studies they have done demos. They have they have graphs

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:30.340
G streamer is getting a virtual reality plug-in and something called sphere

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:34.660
SPH VR this is coming to a G streamer near you soon

01:07:34.660 --> 01:07:41.020
And it's gonna make VR on the Linux desktop a little better. Now this whole whole post is

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:42.860
Frickin

01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:47.380
Phenomenal, it's like it has an introduction to just the spherical coordinate system in general

01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:48.980
Yeah, a little if you haven't done that for a while

01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:56.620
It's a difficulty of understand like capturing the full information of spherical video and all the colors visuals that show that

01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:59.260
Oh, it's it really gets me excited to play with G streamer

01:07:59.260 --> 01:08:03.760
I played with it a little bit recently trying to do some some RTP streams for VoIP stuff

01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:06.420
It's a fantastic

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:13.420
Library, there is so much you can do. It's so composable. It's awesome. I'm really excited to see like they're really pushing forward

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:19.940
You know, we set it with AI and Minecraft, but I feel like for VR now, we're finally seeing like, you know

01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:25.740
Especially with like HoloLens and you get you kind of get like an oculus and the vibe not really supporting Linux

01:08:25.740 --> 01:08:26.700
It gets depressing

01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:32.140
You're like are we where's Linux on these frontiers of things that are really getting all the tech press these days and it's really cool

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:36.780
To see behind the scenes people working on it. Yeah, and and and that they're super sharp. Yes

01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:40.980
It makes me want to help them. I mean like I don't know but makes me want to pick their brain, too

01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:46.620
It's really good stuff. I also liked the announcement of sphere. So it's s again SPH VR

01:08:46.620 --> 01:08:54.500
It's a python video player that's using these new G streamer VR plugins to give you a video player capable of opening

01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:59.600
a URL which has a mapped spherical video

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:01.780
Coordinates in it and then it can play them back

01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:06.940
And the other thing it can do is if you have like the like I do if you have the oculus DK 2 which is

01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:08.980
The last oculus I got perfect

01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:15.020
You'll be able to manage display rotations and stuff like that to work with the oculus use that is so cool

01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:19.020
Super cool. So anyways, we got a little update on the VR front

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:20.660
Maybe it'll go nowhere

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:26.780
but it's nice to see it being done by really really smart sharp people and it being done at the infrastructure level and

01:09:27.180 --> 01:09:31.220
All of this is open source. So you want to use it for your own things? Go for it?

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:35.580
I love that. I love that. I so I want to take a moment before we go any further and

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:39.020
I want to thank Noah

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:46.980
For stepping in and doing the hosting last week just did a phenomenal job and beyond just the actual hosting himself itself

01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:52.740
Which is the least which is the least amount of work the actual show part where we sit here and talking to these microphones is

01:09:52.740 --> 01:09:54.020
The most fun. It's the least amount of work

01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:57.540
It's and it's the part you guys see all of the hard work is

01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:04.440
Setting up for the show is in his case building the broadcast profiles over an OBS. Yeah. Yeah. I know you had to sit there

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:07.380
I know as thank you to you too for bait, you know

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:14.620
found Sunday to for stepping in on laughs on and and and keeping the chat room warm while Noah said all that no idea such a

01:10:15.260 --> 01:10:16.780
Yeah, it's so much work

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:21.020
people have no idea how much work it is and you get a little if you watched live you might have got a glimpse of

01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:26.020
How much and how how many millions of little things there are all those decisions?

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:28.380
Yeah, so I really appreciate it and you know

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:32.580
What's really great about Noah is he he didn't do it because he wants the mic time

01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:36.500
He did it because he wants to make sure he loves the network

01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:41.580
He wants the content to stick around and he doesn't want me to become like some crazy person who pees in jars and locks himself

01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:41.980
in a theater

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:46.800
He wants to make sure I get out there and see the open road from time to time and actually take some time off and so

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.660
I really appreciate that and I you know

01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:53.740
He takes his he takes the time out of his of his work and and you know his family and certainly has a busy life

01:10:53.740 --> 01:11:00.220
It's it's really really appreciated also a big thank you to Ryan Ryan sipes from mycroft who's often on this show

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:06.380
He stepped in on last Sunday and co-hosted with no one did a great job and you know big

01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:07.620
Thank you to Ryan for doing that

01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:13.420
It's great to get insights from somebody out there who's working on a very interesting project right now and it's following these trends and it

01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:18.740
Was Ryan amongst others who passed along our next story and it's called copperhead OS

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:25.320
It is a hardened open source operating system air quotes based on Android and air quotes

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:28.820
Only works with the more recent line of next side device I

01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:35.580
But they say it has protection from zero-day exploits. It has firewall and network hardening. It's open source

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:38.960
So it's audited it has an unofficial port of packs

01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:42.140
Nice, I don't know what that's about

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:46.180
But it's the packs by the way is the kernel self-protection and high quality

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:51.140
ASLR tool and it has a sandboxing and isolation for apps and services

01:11:51.900 --> 01:11:53.900
So there you go. It's called

01:11:53.900 --> 01:12:01.300
Copperhead I think it's pretty cool also just to see like obviously there are already are 5x 6p ROMs, etc

01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:05.820
But this is kind of the one like the as still a user of the original Nexus 5

01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:10.740
It was such a developer platform. So it's cool to see some more promotion around the 5x

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:14.780
Yeah, that sort of stuff makes me more more interested in getting one. Yeah, like it's still gonna be around for a while

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:17.980
I don't know about copperhead itself. So I'll put it out there to the audience if anybody has

01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:22.580
Any experience with it or questions about it? I'd like to hear both

01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:28.140
It seems pretty like we're waiting for feedback. I got I got a little bit of a sense from a few folks in

01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:33.740
the chat room that there's a few concerns and in the pre-show some people are questioning the

01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:39.060
How active perhaps you could say packs is anymore

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:42.420
Mm-hmm. So there's some questions still but like anything like this

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:47.660
There's a lot to get it right and how who knows like how much will track upstream. What's the delay on these patches?

01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:53.940
It's yeah. Yeah. So anyways, thanks you. Thank you to Ryan for setting that into us and thank you to him again for sitting in

01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:55.620
on the latex action show

01:12:55.620 --> 01:13:02.500
And one last thank you the most important. Thank you. Really is is Rekai. I don't know if it comes across

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.300
probably not because

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:11.260
Basically every great decision that Noah has to make on the fly when he's on camera is probably being prompted by Rekai behind the scenes

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:15.580
If you see Noah waiting for something, it's Rekai's answer in telegram

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:20.540
Yeah, and it's Rekai that's down here at all different hours of the shows. He sets everything up

01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:21.740
Yeah, it's crazy

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:25.260
And you know when I'm not here somebody has to be in here to turn this studio on

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:31.140
Which is a task that has to be done in a certain methodical process and I think at one point

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.140
He even got a curveball of a power outage

01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:38.940
Which is one of the worst things that happens in this studio be just because and things have gotten better since we switched to OBS

01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:42.460
So it's not as bad as it used to be but as fate would have it

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:45.620
There is a bug in Antigros with ZFS

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:47.580
No, yeah

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:54.660
And it and it's one that he's reported in the past that they marked fixed that still exists that prevents the OBS rig from booting

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:58.460
Turns out we don't reboot it very often. So we had just about it

01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:01.940
Well, we had since they marked it fixed and we've been keeping up to we've been keeping up to date

01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:04.980
We assumed it was fixed and wouldn't have an issue with the next reboot turns out

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:07.180
So not only did he have to you know

01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:13.100
Really provide assets when no one needed them and answer questions and give guidance and pick better titles than Noah picked

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:17.780
But he also had to like deal with those kinds of issues. So a huge thank you goes out to Rekai

01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:21.700
so really all of you guys made it possible and I really appreciate it and

01:14:22.300 --> 01:14:26.220
Noah's even threatened about offering to do it again sometime. Wow

01:14:27.260 --> 01:14:31.860
What a guy I know that guy that guy so Wes we have to talk about

01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:34.740
Elias Elias Nihilus

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:40.140
This is something that we've debated if we should really discuss on the show for a while because it's one of those

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:43.300
Areas that you're gonna not like it's a weird spot

01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.820
I'm gonna tell you about it and you're gonna be like this sounds like a horrible idea

01:14:45.860 --> 01:14:49.400
It has a back-end server side that collects all your email and processes it

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:54.820
It's a fork of atom. It's what's it's an electron app basically, right?

01:14:54.820 --> 01:15:00.780
That's what is that fair or it's you know, it's a it is a web app that is packaged as a desktop application and

01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:06.100
They want to charge you for the mail client eventually. So those are all things you hate and

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:08.820
You probably wonder why we'd be talking about it

01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:13.900
And I'll give you a reason if they're doing a couple of things that are extremely interesting

01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:16.020
mostly

01:15:16.020 --> 01:15:19.460
around the funding model about going open source and

01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:26.820
About creating a sustainable long-term email client when the future of Thunderbird is a little questionable

01:15:26.820 --> 01:15:31.460
So that's that's an alias and you've been using it for a little while

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:34.820
I have been and it's we'll call it let's just call it and one that's the current version

01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:37.700
Yeah, and why do why did you pick it up? Why did you try it?

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:40.220
You know

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:44.740
At work. I had some reasons to be I still had a Windows environment

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:50.200
I hadn't interact with and then some things changed and so I didn't need Outlook for a certain set of niche features

01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:55.220
Exchange features etc. And so I was really looking for like a Linux. I was like well everything else

01:15:55.220 --> 01:16:00.060
I do obviously is in a Linux environment. And so I was looking for something that had maybe exchange support

01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:02.060
but at least was like a a

01:16:03.500 --> 01:16:05.500
Functional maybe pretty

01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:09.180
Desktop client with just basic email support. I don't do that much

01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:11.180
I have email my phone as well, of course

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:15.020
And I was interested because it was open source. I've also kind of followed some of their blogs

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.200
They do I have a lot of blogs about like Python deployment

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:22.340
They have a cool tool that turns virtual environments into dev packages that I've used personally at work

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:23.940
and

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:26.300
I also liked that it was like yeah, okay, it's paid

01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:29.180
Maybe that's okay. We've talked a lot

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:32.740
We want to talk about we have talked about sustainable development and open source

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:37.780
But they had a build it yourself use it. So I have played with that a little bit

01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:43.760
I'm running so you're running so you can host your own server component if you want to build it. Yes, the Nylas sync engine

01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:50.780
I've had some issues with stability in that like I usually have to restart it a couple of times a week to get it to

01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:54.300
It seems to get into a state where it doesn't really check updates anymore, or it doesn't at least

01:16:54.780 --> 01:17:00.420
The client no longer syncs those upstate updates down. I've actually had that issue with the with their hosted server, too

01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:02.700
Yeah, so I don't know if that's not I I will admit

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:07.760
I'm probably at least one or two weeks behind on their current version. So that may be fixed. I I wouldn't know

01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:13.980
But it is pretty cool there are some limitations like the exchange support you don't get the

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:17.720
Active sync protocol in the open source version

01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:21.220
So you're limited to IMAP Gmail that kind of stuff just probably comes down to a licensing thing

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:27.740
Yes, I'm sure they're licensing some proprietary implementation or something like that. That's how my I'm probably Microsoft roles. Yeah, right exactly

01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:31.740
But it is nice it does work well

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:36.380
But you also then lose a lot of the features of the pro like they have like link track like click tracking

01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:42.500
They have that kind of stuff. I will also say that with this move. They do seem to be pushing the pro pretty hard

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.580
Yeah, so before you could download their

01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:49.580
Pre-compiled files from their website and then you had to make some can they have a JSON config file?

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:54.900
You had to edit it and then you had to like change the environment from production to custom and you put in the URL to

01:17:54.900 --> 01:18:00.780
Your server location and they also don't provide any authentication for that. So it's all plain text HTTP

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:06.100
From the server to the client. So you have to provide your own, you know, SSL proxy or I use

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:08.660
S-pipe D by the developer of

01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:14.740
Tarshnap, which is an awesome. Yeah, easy easy to use thing, but it does work and it is it is cool

01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:19.180
It's kind of neat to have like an intermediary that sinks everything down and then kind of proxies your client

01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:22.500
Why do you work way? Well, they just made like searching works pretty well

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:30.220
The responses are nice the interface so their server-side processing that makes the client experience better. Yeah, I don't know how much better

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:35.780
There's also some losses right like you have to you have to restart this process that doesn't work that well

01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:42.580
at least in the versions I've tried and now I install their latest version and I can't quite seem I might have to just sign in once

01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:47.860
But I can't seem to get it even though I've changed the config file. I can't get it to reference my server

01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:51.860
So maybe they might have changed it so that you can build it in as a component option. I don't know

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:53.860
Wimpy, did you have a question?

01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:59.460
Yeah, Wes. Did you say you're running your own instance of the sync engine? I am and

01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:04.380
Are you in did you install that using vagrant or vSync?

01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:09.180
Is that using vagrant or virtualbox or are you running it on the metal or in docker or something?

01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:15.940
I took their vagrant file and then just ran it myself built it built it myself following the vagrant file instructions

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:17.940
It's running in an LXC container

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:25.860
Okay, and once it's running do you need to I mean the instructions here just say, you know start it

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:31.020
is that all that you need to do is start it and then so the client talks to it and you

01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:35.020
Configure your accounts that way or do you need to poke at the sync engine at all?

01:19:36.300 --> 01:19:39.980
It seemed like a little intermediate you can tell that they've focused really on

01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:42.780
The like they have their own authentication

01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:47.780
they've rolled a lot of their own stuff that maybe isn't open source or they haven't open sourced it yet for their pro service or

01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:49.780
Their you know, they're their hosted service

01:19:50.100 --> 01:19:55.220
So the way that I had to do it at least when I initially configured it was first you run

01:19:55.740 --> 01:19:58.340
A command that adds your first account to it

01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:03.740
Like I just used a gmail account or you can use an IMAP account or whatever and then you run

01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:08.020
One service it's kind of like a micro service architecture

01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:13.160
so you run one service that's their API that you you talk to and then you run another service that actually does the

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:16.120
background syncing with your various upstream accounts

01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.780
Right, and then and then once you've got those two running

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:26.500
It should just work you you have to you have to manually edit your config file to add your new account information. There's like a

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:32.460
Account ID you ID that you plug in you plug in the email address and some other things

01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:38.780
And then the in this certain the API URL and it for in the passage been working

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:42.580
I did have these stability problems as I was mentioning, but otherwise it did work

01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:47.380
Well, I've been using it talking to the IMAP interface to an exchange server just fine

01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:50.220
It's been pretty nice. Have you tried it wimpy?

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:56.420
No, not the not the self host sync engine. I tried nihilus

01:20:57.100 --> 01:21:01.180
Way way way back when it was first out with a you know

01:21:01.180 --> 01:21:08.140
A gash account just to sort of get a feel for it. Yeah. Yeah, I so I'm always I'm not the reason

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:13.740
I was interested in the experiences with the sync engine is the only way I would run this is if I was hosting my own

01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:20.060
And like I couldn't at work. I couldn't run it if I wasn't because I can't you know, I yeah

01:21:20.060 --> 01:21:26.660
You can't talk to your exchange server with weird without doing that. Yeah, and that's that's so here's what they say

01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:32.060
So there's there's a transition happening and I think what maybe I don't want to speak for wimpy

01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:34.060
But I you know West have had conversations with you

01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:39.900
we don't love email, but it is just a it's a it's a fundamental part of our job and

01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:45.900
something that can help us sort through different different hats that we wear and

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:51.260
And and triage our email and one of the things I really like about it is it does really good

01:21:51.660 --> 01:21:54.660
So when I when I open up my inbox, I often talk about it

01:21:54.660 --> 01:22:00.120
I called the inbox monster and I go in there say before a show before Linux unplugged and I want to read some emails

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:04.940
But what happens is at the top of my inbox are really super important emails

01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:09.320
I need to reply to really quickly and that's where I wait. So the system that n1 lets me do with

01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:11.580
Setting reminders and coming back

01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:16.940
It allows me to triage my inbox in a pretty effective way and I like that some of those things sync across multiple devices

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:21.300
and whatnot. Yep, so they say n1 is free as a free as in beer and

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:29.620
Due to its popularity the API traffic for n1 users has dramatically eclipsed the combined volume of all other apps. They've built

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:36.060
They already seen several hundred terabytes of data for their users and they're adding tens of thousands of new users each month

01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:41.420
Which cost them real dollars and the way they write this it's plain spoken. It's it's clear English

01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:46.220
It's not that Red Hat speak that way I got I kind of people were like, you know

01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:50.260
I was just kind of having fun, but it was very corporate speak. This is very clear

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:51.500
They say it very straightforward

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:55.020
We're a small venture funded company with a goal of creating a long-term

01:22:55.380 --> 01:23:01.360
Sustainable business that fuels innovation for email and I will say obviously the caveat is they chose to make a service where they yeah

01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:04.780
Relying on the self-hosting. Yeah, but that's their business model and they say it up front

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:09.660
So it is it really is plain spoken. They kind of make the case for why they think that's a good model right in here

01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:11.480
they also say

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:15.800
They that really if they're gonna make a sustainable business the law on the long-term horizon

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:19.840
They see a risk of continuing to subsidize the free beer version of n1

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:25.420
Companies like mailbox did this and were forced to sell or shut down before they found their business model

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:28.920
They say in reality the beer unfortunately always runs out

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:31.120
Which is something we talked about on the show

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:37.400
And so I do kind of like it that they have a clear revenue model and they they take the ad thing and they just they

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:39.840
Just they just address it directly. They say why not show ads

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:47.360
Well, if that's not for us companies like Google and Yahoo provide free email services by mining your data and serving targeted ads based on

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.960
the content

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:51.640
That's not the way they think that's not the way they want to do business

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:56.400
They say while this is potentially lucrative it goes against our principles and it's not the business we aim to build

01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:02.800
We think there's a better way. So with their quote-unquote pro version. They're announcing a premium version of n1

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:09.560
It allow you to continue n1. You can use the nihilist cloud or you can use it for free on your own with your own

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:14.880
Hosted server so their revenue their revenue system their model here basically breaks down to

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:22.160
We have a reasonable priced version. We've open sourced it and we implement it for you and you can pay us or

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:28.360
If you don't want to pay you can go through all the trouble that West just went through and you can run it yourself

01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:33.040
Is that is that is that a fair model or is that just basically?

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:40.480
One hair shy of not releasing the whole thing because you're not necessarily providing pre-built builds necessarily, right?

01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.480
You're not necessarily providing any

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:49.440
Documentation you're not making any real clear design choices in the n1 client to make it support the self hosted sync server

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:52.880
So is that really legitimate West? I will also say it's interesting

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.920
That's a great question. Also

01:24:55.920 --> 01:25:00.620
They're kind of adding like a new link in the chain here where it's like

01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:04.420
There's plenty of services where you're like do I want premium email to and to pay for it?

01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:08.580
And I don't have like email or the gmail you they read your stuff making me month pay monthly for email

01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:09.500
But they don't host it

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:15.060
This is just an intermediate like you're still connecting it to an other email account that you may pay like maybe we have fastmail

01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:19.540
And then you pay also for nihilist to connect to when the irony is if you have it in gmail

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:24.420
Are you really that worried about this about your data sensitivity that's in gmail

01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:26.540
If you really care of n1 sniffing through it

01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:33.380
I don't so what do you think West is this a legitimate model they get to write open source all over this blog post

01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:37.880
I want let's let's do a little search here, so let's search for let's do a search for open

01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:41.480
Let's do a search for open just open because I don't want to do two words

01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:46.760
So there's 13 references if I narrow it down to source 10 references

01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:49.860
So they've referenced open source 10 times in this blog post

01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:56.120
Wow, do they legit it can they do you think do you feel like they can legitimately consider themselves an open source project I?

01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:00.580
Don't know I mean, it's pretty close

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:03.460
It does seem to be and I'll I'll do some follow-up

01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:07.280
I'll make sure I recompiled everything with the latest stuff and yeah, it all still works

01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:11.660
But as long as they give you that option where you can self host you're comfortable

01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:12.940
I mean, I don't about comfortable

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:18.020
It doesn't make me necessarily want to use their service and I think they are harping on that pretty hard

01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:21.940
And they are also kind of you know they started out with it, and they switched

01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:23.380
But I mean they are being transparent

01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:27.820
But it is still kind of like a we were excited for the free thing and it was like the years that we're gonna

01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:31.280
Switch and so it kind of it changes. Here's the good guy thing they did though

01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:37.660
Anybody who's using n1 now got a coupon to use the paid service for a year for free yes

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:40.980
So that's not cheap for them to do a couple of stats to throw at you

01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:43.360
Just you know is it an open source project well

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:47.920
I one of the things I like about n1 is they've shipped 26 major updates

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:50.720
Mm-hmm they are legitimately iterating on this product

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:54.140
That's why I think you need to find a revenue model that doesn't mind my data

01:26:54.180 --> 01:27:00.940
Which is even more important when they have any mediary they launched new features like snoozing and send later and read receipts and link tracking

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.580
Which are?

01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:06.420
Intensely helpful for me when I do certain reports. I really appreciate that

01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:10.380
They have scaled their back end by 20 times over

01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:13.380
They have had

01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:20.300
1,000 and 200 github issues resolved 130 poll requests 24 new themes launched 20 new plugins

01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:26.180
50 outside contributors and the repo has 17,000 stars ranking it 70 number 75

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:33.820
Across everything on github. It's actually ranked higher than elastasearch ansible go or kubernetes Wow

01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:36.620
so I

01:27:36.620 --> 01:27:40.240
Want them to find it. I I do you know what the monthly price is here

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:46.020
I know there's a month monthly seven dollars a month or something like that. That might be wrong

01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:46.940
Yeah, I got a look

01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:51.220
I'm gonna play with I've been using it for a few days because email is a big problem for me, right?

01:27:51.220 --> 01:27:56.140
And all my emails essentially public anyways and most of what I read on air some of it's not but the stuff

01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:59.580
That's not again. It wouldn't wouldn't ruin me if I got published. There's nothing really

01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:03.340
There's no Snowden leaks in there or something right and the email that I'm super serious about

01:28:03.900 --> 01:28:07.660
I have PGP encryption and I go ahead

01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:12.140
I was gonna say and they've had some pretty cool pairing with keybase. Yeah work that into the client

01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:18.660
They also have been working with them. So if you use Nihilus, you can jump the line on keybase and get yourself a keybase count

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:21.460
Oh, that's cool. I didn't know about that cuz I already have a keybase account. So that's cool

01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:25.980
Um keybase is I don't know you maybe you're not a big fan of keybase out there

01:28:25.980 --> 01:28:34.180
But for me it makes it makes GPG encryption approachable to just about every audience member and I have had people take advantage of it

01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:38.660
To send me confidential things and I'm extremely thankful for this for that service

01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:42.700
so integrating that support into my mail client because it's already the workflow I'm using is

01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:46.660
That might be worth the price of admission right there and it's pretty neat

01:28:46.660 --> 01:28:49.780
Like I tried it out a little bit. Maybe you and I should send some email later

01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:51.820
Hello, you know

01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:55.780
you just like you go in there and you can search for your keybase friends or people you know on keybase or people on

01:28:55.780 --> 01:29:00.660
Keybase and then you add their keys and then when you send emails or them you have the option of encrypting it using their keybase

01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:05.420
And that's how it should be. Yeah, right because it's it's and and it's backed by legitimate GPG security

01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:10.820
So it's I like it. So n1 it's interesting to see a oh and of course, it's cross-platform

01:29:10.820 --> 01:29:14.580
It's not just a Linux app either. So that's also electron. Yeah, it's very it's very useful

01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:17.740
They talk a little bit about how they forked it from from Adam in there

01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:21.260
Which I thought was really kind of fascinating the UI is nice. It has a dark theme

01:29:21.300 --> 01:29:25.380
It does. Yeah, the only I've just had so I've had a few bugs. My main my main bug is

01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:31.740
I I tend to leave my email running on one of my virtual desktops all the time and after about 24 hours

01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:35.140
I get it integrates with gnome desktops notifications

01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:41.180
So I get notifications of new mail arriving, but when I switch to the mail client nothing new in the list after closing

01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:48.900
So still some things to work out, but it's it's open. Yeah, I don't know mumble room. Hey mumble room. Maybe you know any

01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:51.740
Any any thoughts before we move on?

01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:53.900
anyone else

01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:55.900
No, look at that West

01:29:56.060 --> 01:30:03.300
Nothing. Nobody thinks anything about n1 about Thunderbird about email on Linux about about how to fund open-source

01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:06.600
Development sustainably didn't we solve everything with web?

01:30:08.660 --> 01:30:10.660
Outlook 365

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:15.780
Nobody wants email on their desktop as an app as a standalone application, even if it is an electron app

01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:17.780
No, that is am I?

01:30:18.060 --> 01:30:23.740
What you do is you use Firefox as an app or Chrome as an app, you know market

01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:31.180
Yeah, I know solve that your web-based works or pin tag is pin tabs. Mm-hmm. I use Thunderbird quite happily

01:30:31.180 --> 01:30:33.180
I love Thunderbird

01:30:33.460 --> 01:30:39.100
Seriously, yeah, maybe we should all be using deco rotten corpse drop this one in there a nice leaf

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.980
It's got now desktop convergence in there

01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:47.740
This is a pretty nice looking mail client that will be one of probably the premier mail clients

01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:51.220
Maybe one of the top apps once the new unity desktop ships

01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:55.360
So this is it works in mobile and it works in desktop config. And if you think about it

01:30:56.040 --> 01:31:00.320
Screw sinking. I just want the same application in whatever form factor. I'm using

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:04.880
I want the same exact application with the same exact set of data. That's the way to do it

01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.880
I don't need some back-end sink

01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:12.460
So I like deco check it out. We got a link to an OMG Ubuntu article that talks about it

01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:16.760
It looks pretty cool. Dan Chapman is the one that was talking about it on Google+. Cool, Dan. Nice work

01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:21.720
Check it out deco d e k k. Oh, that's important

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:22.000
Yeah

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:27.080
now if you want to get the skills to pay the bills and maybe set up your own n1 server check out Linux Academy at

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.000
Linux Academy comm slash unplug

support this show and get yourself a discount at Linux Academy a platform to learn more about all of the technologies around Linux the core

01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:42.040
Fundamentals and all the great technologies that we all talk about all the time and also things like open stack and AWS

01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:45.720
Which is definitely its own monster and the dev ops quote-unquote category

01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:51.800
which used to sound like a joke and now it's like a full legitimate category that people do as a full-time jerk and then

01:31:51.960 --> 01:31:58.040
Astonishingly enough as your courseware too. It's here. Ladies and gentlemen, it's here. They're adding stuff all the time

01:31:58.040 --> 01:31:59.360
They have great material

01:31:59.360 --> 01:32:04.500
They have a system that will help you regardless of how much time you have available a little bit of time a whole lot

01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:07.880
Of time Linux Academy has a system for you. They have availability planners

01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:12.440
You can plug it all in there when you're available to create courseware. They have great pre-done courses

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:16.840
You can follow with really easy to understand sex sections. You'll go in there. You're logging into a dashboard

01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:21.160
You'll see how much work you have to do. You can download the material listen to it offline

01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:28.480
Instructor mentoring is available when you want it assessments and note cards are great features and the practice exams are one of my favorites

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:36.360
They also have great study tools a community full of Jupiter broadcasting members and hands-on scenarios that will give you a real-world experience

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.520
So if you want to go set up a mail server on your own

01:32:38.520 --> 01:32:43.840
Why don't you try it out first in the lab learn to do it the right way get a hands-on experience because once you set

01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:49.200
Something up like that you hit the ground running and you never look back. I think this is a great tool

01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:55.160

So Wes I could try to stumble all over myself and try to describe what matrix is

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:11.740
They describe themselves as an open standard for decentralized

01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:16.000
communication or group collaboration a fully distributed

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:23.540
persistent chat room with no central authority the missile the missing signaling layer for web

01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:30.080
RTC it's like slack, but way better. It's like matter most but way more

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:33.640
It's like XMPP, but people really use it maybe

01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:37.840
Yeah, and and there's some really interesting developments around it, too

01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:41.680
So to kick it off if you're not familiar with it. Let's start with an interview

01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:45.360
I did last year at OSCON with a matrix developer. Oh

01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:49.000
Hold on. Hold on. Did you you could hear it right way?

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.480
Yeah, you could hear it, but you know what you were hearing it only to you were hearing it

01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:55.720
It's me when I say it to Noah. I'm gonna send it to you

01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:03.160
Infrastructure and got quite depressed in the end because it was meant to be like this email

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:08.280
but for open video except in practice nobody has CPR eyes on their business cards and

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:12.940
The open Federation the open interoperability thing just hasn't really quite taken off

01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:18.080
So we went through wrote some alternative to set based on HTTP

01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:22.720
Just a really simple HTTP API or if I want to set up a video called somebody I do one hit

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:28.280
With the offer of what media I want to talk and you do one hit back with the answer and that's it

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:28.780
We're in a call

01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:33.920
So none of the complexities of set with all the you know, it's a UDP is it TLS is a TCP

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:38.160
It's a this version is of that version so it's quite old and very fragmented

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:43.840
Just doing it as an HTTP works a lot better. And that's one of the things you can use with matrix

01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:48.520
I think that matrix isn't just about open video. You can also use it for instant messaging

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:53.600
We've got the little drone sitting down there, which we're about to launch as an internet of things

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:58.640
And demo where you can go and get the video off it by matrix, but you can also control it

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:01.440
We want some hooks up people's cars to matrix

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:08.120
So the car kind of sends out telemetry as little blobs of Jason into matrix and you can go and consume it anywhere else

01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:10.160
So basically matrix is a big open

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:16.240
Decentralized object database with pub subs come out and semantics so that anybody can publish any random data

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:19.240
They want and they could be a message or whatever over here on the screen

01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:23.280
Am I seeing like a persistent group chat environment kind of looks like a bit like IRC and messaging

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:23.960
Yeah, yeah

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:28.600
So this is one of the classic things you can do with matrix use it as a persistent group chat thing

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:30.720
This is an angular environment

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:34.320
And there are a couple of hundred chats going on there

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:40.160
A lot of these are bridge for into free node free node have been very cool and let us gone and actually bridge matrix into free

01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:41.960
node or vice-versa

01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:48.840
Here's another view of the same room say but a more slack like environments and this one's written in react

01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:53.280
And so this is kind of like a like a team collaboration

01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:57.280
Sort of version of it sitting on top of the matrix object database

01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:03.680
So and and so I assume in this I could have text image video audio all those things in here

01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:03.960
Yeah

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:09.640
So any Jason you like so well you can hear these are just instant messages with people trying to do weird shit with UTF 8

01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:15.640
But if we go back to this one if you double click on stuff like a message like test there

01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:17.920
You can see it's just arbitrary Jason

01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:22.880
So it could be a M room message or if you were doing a video cool

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:26.320
Yeah, it could be a bit uglier

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:32.360
It's a M cool invite and you've got the description of the media for that cooler, but it could be drone control

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:36.640
It could be a car telemetry whatever the hell and my program my app just needs to be able to read this and know what?

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:37.920
To do with it. Yeah, precisely

01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:43.360
So we I want to stop right there because he's about to talk about servers to find some standard types like M dot cool

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:47.960
Anything that begins M dot is matrix and it's part of our spec and this is where we're gonna pick up

01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:53.160
So I'll let him just finish off his thoughts here. So matrix itself is not a one particular

01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:00.680
Project it's where it gets interesting. Yeah, it's not just like we're madder most is the entire thing here, but it's like Java namespace

01:37:00.680 --> 01:37:03.980
So if you wanted to have a I know come dot Google

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:09.000
Whatever the hell people might use it for then just feel free go nuts put data room

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.720
So if I wanted to roll this out, what's my what's my back-end structure look like? Is it a Linux server?

01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:19.040
What's running on so we're providing one reference over at the moment, which is written in Python and twisted and

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:22.200
It's about 30,000 lines of code

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:24.560
It's pretty beat up

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:31.260
But it works well enough to have rooms with like a thousand people in it and a couple of hundreds and service participating and it runs

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:34.720
Any OS that can support Python really?

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.860
Some of that is it could be Debian

01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:42.800
They've got some Docker files Susie images fedora images and even somebody made it run on Windows

01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:50.920
So that during so that was 2015 when they had the one implementation now, we're gonna fast-forward to 2016

01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:55.340
Let's see. How are they doing? Well, there's a couple of new contenders West you found a ruma

01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:59.840
Which is a matrix home server written in rust a home server like families or what?

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:04.780
So it was a home server like a like your base and then you connect to other server. What's the home? Yeah, exactly. So

01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:09.020
part of the power of matrix is kind of the federation angle so you

01:38:09.380 --> 01:38:15.900
Can make an account and you identify with a home server and then those home servers integrate with other home servers as part of the larger

01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:18.340
Matrix, yeah, pretty neat. Yeah, and so

01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:24.900
An application like this written in rust is pretty compelling itself just because of the advantages of something like this being written in rust

01:38:25.120 --> 01:38:27.820
But then there's something that has a lot of momentum behind right now

01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:33.300
The chairman was just talking about it during that interview and that's vector and vector is an open source

01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:40.180
Collaborate collaboration app. They say it's production ready and it's built on top of the matrix open standard and they have Android apps

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:43.900
They have a really nice looking you are well polished

01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:45.420
Yeah, it really does look good

01:38:45.420 --> 01:38:52.080
And so these are full featured collaboration suites that involve not just chat and then connected in with IRC

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:58.360
But web RTC and document transfer and all this kind of stuff. What would what would you see like a work use case for you?

01:38:58.360 --> 01:38:59.340
in matrix

01:38:59.340 --> 01:39:06.940
Well, you know we at my work and we've we've used slack. We also use Skype for business and they kind of meet different needs

01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:08.940
It'd be interesting if those were integrated. Mm-hmm

01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:15.660
Also, just like with rocket chat and the other things we've checked out slack as proprietary you lose control in particular at my office

01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:17.780
Like there's like multiple teams have different slack accounts

01:39:17.780 --> 01:39:24.260
And also if you don't use their paid account you start losing messages really fast as we're aware, right?

01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:29.220
So this would be interesting and the other cool part is slack has like their bridges like the IRC bridge people

01:39:29.220 --> 01:39:34.060
Really like that but matrix does that too? And so like they have they even have a slap slack bridge

01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:38.460
I haven't tried it. I'd be really interested to try it, but it just like it sounds so extensible

01:39:38.460 --> 01:39:41.840
yeah, it's like a plumbing system for collaboration and

01:39:42.460 --> 01:39:47.720
They when I when I talked to them, I was really the interview is it's much longer. It's

01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:52.020
There's at least another four minutes in that interview and then I probably talked to him for 15 minutes

01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:54.700
I have the interview linked in the show notes if you want to hear the other four minutes and

01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:59.540
It it was really they were so far ahead of the puck

01:39:59.620 --> 01:40:03.340
So when when I had to put this in context when I was talking to him

01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:06.120
This was more than a year ago slack was

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:10.980
This newish thing that just seemed like IRC that I thought was a joke

01:40:10.980 --> 01:40:15.780
And I didn't really it what nobody talked about at the time and they were talking about something

01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:22.020
That's ten times more than slack and they were just so far ahead of the of where the puck was going that I think they're

01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:26.160
Still ahead of it. And so that's why with these servers just now a year later kind of coming out

01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:31.660
I think they're just on time really anyways, it's a it's a fascinating open source project

01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:35.400
We've talked about a few of them this week. I will say also just seeing their connection with sip

01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:41.540
That's a technology that is deployed at massive scale today. Yeah, you know and and so just if

01:40:42.100 --> 01:40:44.100
Have that kind of pedigree

01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:49.440
It makes me confident that they can deploy things that really do scale and can develop a protocol that might actually work

01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:56.900
Yeah, and you know spider oak is working on something kind of like this called SEMA for and we're gonna have a quick review

01:40:56.900 --> 01:41:00.700
By mr. Ham radio in the post show. So SEMA for is another thing kind of like this

01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:05.980
Yeah, there you go. So vector and ruma and they're all matrix implementations

01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:11.280
Really kind of neat thing. So that is a lot to process if you guys want to read more about it

01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:16.740
We'll have links in the show notes Linux action show dot reddit commas where you go for any of the feedback topics

01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:20.340
We have posed to you this week. I will toss it to the mumble room one more time

01:41:21.140 --> 01:41:27.700
Mumble room. Is there anything you'd like to add before we go OMG OMG OMG? No, no, there you go

01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:32.720
You see you could be part of our virtual log and have nothing to contribute at this point to buy coin. Please do

01:41:34.020 --> 01:41:39.140
IT there's really nothing there's not much more to say is there that's really I just give my go try it come back next week

01:41:39.140 --> 01:41:42.020
And let us know what I miss them, you know, I missed this mumble room

01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:43.700
So I gotta give them a little bit of a hard time

01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:48.800
Yeah, if you've tried to if you've played with any of this stuff really let us know what you think Linux action at reddit comm

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:51.740
Or even better show up live. Here's how you do that

01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:57.140
Go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar and then go over there get your get this show converted to your local times

01:41:57.140 --> 01:42:02.980
Or any of the shows you would like to attend we have it all listed there and it converts automatically to your time zone

01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:04.060
That's how we go

01:42:04.060 --> 01:42:09.180
That's how we roll and then JB live TV is where you go to watch it and you join the chat room

01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:10.860
you do a bang mumble in there and

01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:15.740
The j-bot who stands by waiting for your commands will let deliver you the info

01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:19.860
Then we just do a quick mic check and you're in mumble is pretty cool like that

01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:24.080
It really is although you threw me a crew of curveball second year in a row. Where would I go?

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:30.420
I went somewhere last year where Noah hosted and you had to do push to talk and mumble. Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah

01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:37.860
I sat down to do tech talk today and I was like, um, why can't they hear me and bit freeze and he's like

01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:43.020
We can't hear you Chris. I'm like I can hear you and it took me about ten seconds. Oh, man. It wasn't a big deal

01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:47.100
I figured all you guys push to talk. Yep. It's push. Oh, sorry. Yeah, so we like it if you have a headset

01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:47.380
Yeah

01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:52.620
You we like it if you use push to talk and we just check your audio and if you pass those things and you have some

01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:56.620
Info in something insightful or interesting you want to say about one of the Linux topics with more

01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:58.620
We'd be more than happy to have you join us in the mumble room

01:42:58.620 --> 01:43:02.580
It's it really is our virtual log and if you can't go out and meet with people and meet space

01:43:02.580 --> 01:43:07.900
Why not get the next best thing right here right here at the Linux unplugged program and that?

01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:10.220
Brings us to an end

01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:16.500
We have avoided the lawnmower one more time. Just barely just barely watch out. He's coming back. We got to sneak out of here

01:43:16.780 --> 01:43:18.700
Thank you guys for tuning in

01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:24.900
Don't forget to submit content if there's something you didn't hear us talking about or if there's something just burning inside your soul

01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:28.460
Maybe a compliment you want to make maybe you want to welcome me back

01:43:28.460 --> 01:43:34.780
It wouldn't that be nice Linux action show dot reddit comm you'll find a thread for 153 in there

01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:40.200
And then you can also go over to the contact page at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact and send us in some feedback

01:43:40.200 --> 01:44:09.440
Okay, that brings us to an end of this week's show. We'll see you right back here next Tuesday

01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:18.120
You hear that do you hear that that sounds that sounds out of here that sounds like a lawnmower oh

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:21.280
My oh, they ruin the end

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:28.800
JB titles comm JB titles comm get out of here most of the web runs on servers powered by Linux like that one

01:44:28.800 --> 01:44:30.980
Yeah, actually I think that one might actually run on BST

01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:38.200
Huh is that true reciters that does that run on on Linux now most of the web runs on servers powered by Linux

01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:43.920
Hey look poppy made I secretly use Arch Linux. Oh wait that was that was poppy. I miss poppy

01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:45.920
I do too. I haven't seen him for a few weeks

01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:52.160
He's on holiday oh good for him well that makes me happy so there you go

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:59.060
I did see I did see like a post recently. I think I did know that JB titles calm JB titles calm

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:01.400
Let's go over there ladies and gentlemen

01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:08.520
If we could all direct our attention to bang suggest calm or JB titles calm, haha

01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:12.680
Whatever makes you happier. There's been 93 title suggestions in the last 24 hours

01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:16.160
Now we just need to go through those sons of bitches

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:20.640
Be gentle with them everyone. Let's just sort them out

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:26.480
Bring the best of the top who doesn't like a little up though now and again over at JB titles

01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:28.840
Make that our make that arrow

01:45:28.840 --> 01:45:30.840
Take off

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:34.960
Niche Android OS horrible

01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:38.920
Quantum of solace

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:47.120
Horrible those are horrible topics horrible titles Linux Mon go horrible

01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:51.640
Unity on Windows kind of funny. Yeah kind of

01:45:52.680 --> 01:45:54.680
so

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:56.680
Yeah, Windows United

01:45:56.800 --> 01:46:01.080
Your vote matters over JB titles calm it might not matter

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:03.400
anywhere else

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:07.640
But a JB titles you make an actual difference not that it was the core of the show

01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:12.680
But go and get solace is good. That's good. I like it. Yeah, I like it

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.040
You know you know what we need to get more of is

01:46:15.520 --> 01:46:20.460
Direct lines from the show because I like when I'm listening to podcasts and I hear a direct sentence

01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:24.600
I'm like oh, that's mm-hmm, so we should do more of those two those are those are kind of fun. Thank

01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:29.080
You guys in the mom room for being here. Oh, yeah, we're super appreciate it. You guys are great

01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:32.680
I'm turning your son's training the spider kid. Oh, oh

01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:35.240
He is my kid

01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:38.480
Minecraft maniac really oh boy anyways

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:43.240
I said we'd we'd hear from a ham and get his review of SEMA for so let's bring him in hey

01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:47.300
Good good. I'm good. I'm good. What are you up to over there in Idaho?

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:49.100
Oh

01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:53.200
Too much checking out SEMA for SEMA SEMA

01:46:54.020 --> 01:46:54.900
SEMA

01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:59.660
Tell me what do you got all over your hands SEMA for what is this is this like a slack killer?

01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:03.100
It is but I don't think quite yet

01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:07.420
Okay, so when I saw this I tell you what it got me excited

01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:12.340
Probably even maybe irrationally is that it's made by spider oak, and I thought that was pretty cool

01:47:12.340 --> 01:47:18.980
That is cool. However. It's not quite there yet. Oh, oh, so it says the world's first zero knowledge

01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:23.500
Collaboration tool is here now. They say it's here right there him they say in the first sentence

01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:31.440
Now you can collaborate productively and by the way privately because guess what your ideas matter

01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:36.780
That's right. Hashtag channels exist and you can create teams for your company for your fam and for your friends

01:47:36.780 --> 01:47:39.680
You just your BFFs. So what didn't you like about it?

01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:41.680
Well, it's still early days

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:47.960
There's no Android client yet. It's coming soon. Okay, so I only have the chance to test it on the desktop

01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:53.920
The nice thing is is it does come in Debian and RPM packages. Oh, so

01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:56.680
completely native to Linux

01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:01.120
They have Windows 7 and Mac support on iOS port

01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:04.280
And we're coming soon

01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:07.240
The

01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:11.800
You can create a channel, but you can't lead a channel

01:48:12.600 --> 01:48:14.600
You can't edit messages

01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:18.320
You can't delete messages. Hmm. I

01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:25.600
Tried posting in a YouTube link and you know, it just gave YouTube link. It didn't like actually have the show up

01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:29.720
I do like the link preview because then you know, it's worth your time clicking or not

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:33.960
That's one of the nice things that matter most does my thing matter most does that super well and so does slack

01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:37.680
Yeah, I agree. Now these things are coming in

01:48:38.680 --> 01:48:42.400
Upcoming versions. Hmm. It's just not there yet. Well

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:47.160
Interesting. I mean I like this from spider oak and the thing that they said that they kind of got my attention

01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:50.600
Was that it's it's it's zero knowledge on their part. So they

01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:55.920
Definitely. Yeah, and they hackers love weak passwords that say to protect your security and privacy

01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:59.600
SEMA 4 will generate a secure recovery queue for you at signup and then store it in a safe place

01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:04.520
SEMA 4 will generate a secure recovery queue for you at signup and then store it in a safe place. Which they email to you. Huh?

01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:07.920
That's interesting. They email that to you. So don't ever lose that. Print it

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:15.000
Yeah, I'm curious what the intended market for this product is

01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:22.640
Is it like? I think it's like it's like people who want Dropbox and and slack in one thing maybe

01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:27.080
Okay. All right. Okay. So the Dropbox thing I get because they're you know

01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:33.240
Zero knowledge encryption for spider oak one makes perfect sense. Yeah. Yeah, but for a

01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:35.520
chat tool

01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:37.520
that is

01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:43.840
Primarily adopted by development teams these days. Why does that need to be zero knowledge and encrypted?

01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:49.160
It seems unnecessary and overkill. I'm not sure. You know where I could see this for is journalists, maybe

01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:53.520
What about that? What about journalists who want to collaborate within something like slack? Yeah

01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:58.120
Yeah, sure. That's pretty nice. No, because they could also just run their own matter most instance

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:05.040
Right journalists won't do that. They know they know they won't know they won't typically. Yeah, I think that I think that's a good one

01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:08.760
I think I think you've you found you found the market that I was struggling to identify

01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:12.520
Boy, I mean, I'm I like that spider oak is doing this. I

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:19.700
Myself, I'm not really all that tempted ham. What what tempted you to try it? Was it just the spider oak name or what?

01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:24.260
That and it's just the zero knowledge, you know

01:50:24.260 --> 01:50:30.180
Just a complete security and privacy for all these things. You need to keep totally secure and private in Idaho over there

01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:32.780
Exactly exactly

01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:37.980
It kind of integrates with their spider oak one backup, you know, I dig that kind of separate

01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:42.860
But yeah, and you use it uses some of the spider oak infrastructure to send files and whatnot, which is good

01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:47.180
Yeah, yeah, it's slightly more expensive than

01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:52.960
The slack because I think you said slack is six dollars a user user. Yeah, so you can try it for free

01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:58.220
Now do they have their own hosted? Do they have their own hosted server or how's that work ham?

01:50:58.220 --> 01:51:05.540
Did did you you run it off if they're talking about it being zero information? They must run all of these services components, correct?

01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:10.460
Yes, there is no way as far as I have seen to run your own server

01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:12.300
the

01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:14.420
They charge nine dollars a user

01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:19.540
So there so their market is people who don't want to go through the hassle of setting up their own server

01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:22.020
But still want to have trust in the security of it

01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:29.920
Exactly and there is probably something to that if you know if I was to set up my own matter most server

01:51:30.340 --> 01:51:34.580
This spider would probably be even more secure than that really. Yeah

01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:40.940
You know to be honest at least after the first couple of weeks cuz I'm not going back in that thing once I got

01:51:40.940 --> 01:51:44.940
set up

01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:53.920
They do have so they have standard and pro which is standard is you can have you know unlimited teams unlimited history

01:51:54.260 --> 01:51:58.920
$9 a month standard, which is everybody pays their own clean $9

01:51:59.820 --> 01:52:06.260
Protein is where the leader of a team pays for everybody else, which is still nine dollars. That's kind of nice

01:52:06.260 --> 01:52:11.300
Yeah, they have they do have a basic and version which is what I'm trying out now

01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:18.380
It's it and you can have unlimited people but it's still but you know, it's only 30-day history. Hmm

01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:22.600
So are you gonna stick with it for a bit or are you gonna move on?

01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:29.740
Trying it out, I mean, there's no reason for me to uninstall it. I mean, you know, it's a free version stuff as

01:52:29.740 --> 01:52:36.060
As right now as your buddy Richard says what's wrong with that? Yeah, what's wrong with that?
