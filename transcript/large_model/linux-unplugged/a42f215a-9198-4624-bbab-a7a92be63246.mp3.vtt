WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.960
Got an email saying that my Pine phone has shipped.

00:02.960 --> 00:04.080
What about you Cheesy?

00:04.080 --> 00:05.280
Oh yeah, I got that email.

00:05.280 --> 00:07.560
Super excited.

00:07.560 --> 00:09.880
Pine noticed you weren't on the show last week,

00:09.880 --> 00:10.880
and they're like, what could we do

00:10.880 --> 00:12.440
to get Chees back on the air?

00:12.440 --> 00:14.080
What they said is, we'll just ship the Pine phone.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.160
That's pretty amazing, man.

00:15.160 --> 00:16.120
Yeah, I mean, that's a good call.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.800
They got me back here.

00:17.800 --> 00:18.800
It's the Braveheart edition,

00:18.800 --> 00:21.080
so this is going to be the rougher one.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.380
But they're shipping out, and I don't know,

00:23.380 --> 00:26.120
I guess maybe I'll have mine in the next week or so.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.640
We should come up with some fun projects in house with,

00:28.640 --> 00:30.120
something, you know, play around.

00:30.120 --> 00:31.120
We gotta put it through its paces.

00:31.120 --> 00:31.960
Right?

00:31.960 --> 00:32.800
Mm-hmm.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.160
We gotta demand the utmost performance.

00:34.160 --> 00:36.160
This thing has to be completely production, oh wait.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.800
It's our responsibility to the community.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.200
Actually, we just want to play around.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.240
Yeah, I'm a little jealous.

00:41.240 --> 00:46.240
Hello friends, welcome into Lytics Unplugged.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.240
My name is Chris.

00:52.240 --> 00:53.080
My name is Wes.

00:53.080 --> 00:55.520
Wes, we have quite the fun episode today,

00:55.520 --> 00:58.200
because for more than a few weeks,

00:58.200 --> 01:01.080
we've had some really great hardware in house.

01:01.080 --> 01:02.680
We've been kicking it around, benchmarking it,

01:02.680 --> 01:05.160
and just recently put it through some upgrade paces.

01:05.160 --> 01:08.160
So we'll tell you about our thoughts on the new Dell XPS 13.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.480
Well, new-ish.

01:09.480 --> 01:10.880
More on that too.

01:10.880 --> 01:14.880
And I'm not alone in saying that we have so much to get to.

01:14.880 --> 01:15.920
So to help me say it,

01:15.920 --> 01:17.000
I'm going to let Alex and Chee say it.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.280
Hey guys, say something great about the show today.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.000
It's a big, big, big, big show.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.240
Yeah, that's what I usually go with.

01:22.240 --> 01:23.840
Something great about the show today.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.520
Oh, Alex.

01:26.480 --> 01:27.320
Dang it.

01:27.320 --> 01:28.160
I mean, I thought that was funny.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.000
Making this.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.840
I'm sorry if it wasn't, but I don't care.

01:30.840 --> 01:33.080
Okay, good enough.

01:33.080 --> 01:33.920
Accepted.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.400
You know, I mean, I'll give you a check mark for effort,

01:36.400 --> 01:38.040
but I'm not giving it much more than that.

01:38.040 --> 01:39.360
And of course, really,

01:39.360 --> 01:42.920
the thing that we can rely on today is the Mumble Room.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.200
We have a huge virtual lug.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.760
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:45.760 --> 01:46.600
Hello.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.440
Hello.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.280
Good evening.

01:48.280 --> 01:50.920
The deafening cries of the Mumble Room.

01:50.920 --> 01:51.800
That's massive in there.

01:51.800 --> 01:52.640
I mean, I don't know.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.520
It doesn't really come across as like super massive,

01:54.520 --> 01:56.960
but there's 14 on air.

01:56.960 --> 02:00.320
21 people total just hanging out in the Mumble streaming.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.240
It's the place to be.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.760
It's, you know, these Tuesdays

02:02.760 --> 02:05.360
are really kind of a lot of fun because we stream live.

02:05.360 --> 02:06.520
We're doing a double recording.

02:06.520 --> 02:07.840
We won't be live next week.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.160
And so we get to hang out for a couple of hours,

02:10.160 --> 02:11.000
talk Linux,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.840
or sometimes the conversations go in weird directions.

02:13.840 --> 02:15.720
I'll admit that's true for the pre-show.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.160
And that's why you want to show up live.

02:17.160 --> 02:21.120
But as always, we have some community news to get into,

02:21.120 --> 02:22.040
some really interesting stuff,

02:22.040 --> 02:24.520
really kind of important community news this week.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.160
There's two things that I think are worth chewing on this week.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.440
And one of them is when a community gets left out.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.760
It's both good news and bad news in this case.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.240
Fedora Core OS has come out of preview

02:35.240 --> 02:38.240
and they've announced that it is available for general use.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.120
That's great.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.560
But it also means there's a community of users,

02:42.560 --> 02:45.640
the ones that ran the Core OS Container Linux

02:45.640 --> 02:46.560
that are left out.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.840
They were told they should migrate

02:48.840 --> 02:50.080
to the new Fedora Core OS.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.960
However, documentation is not yet provided

02:52.960 --> 02:55.560
to actually make that migration possible.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.320
Sometimes these things happen.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.640
And as all great things in open source,

02:59.640 --> 03:02.600
there's a fork and a community has spun up

03:02.600 --> 03:05.880
around flat car Container Linux,

03:05.880 --> 03:09.240
which is a direct compatible continuation

03:09.240 --> 03:12.960
of Container Linux, a new community forms.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.040
But what are the admins that are running this

03:15.040 --> 03:15.920
in production left to do?

03:15.920 --> 03:17.080
They have to decide to either go

03:17.080 --> 03:19.520
with a non-compatible conversion to Fedora Core OS.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.600
Right, which will require a bunch of manual interventions.

03:22.600 --> 03:26.960
Or use this community offshoot fork

03:26.960 --> 03:30.040
of a product that's no longer around.

03:30.040 --> 03:30.960
It's a lot to maintain.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.560
And these are production grade systems.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.640
If you'll recall, one of the great advantages

03:35.640 --> 03:38.160
of Container Linux was centralized configuration

03:38.160 --> 03:41.000
across all your different machines using etcd

03:41.000 --> 03:43.520
and automatic OS updates.

03:43.520 --> 03:46.280
Isn't the irony here that the distribution

03:46.280 --> 03:50.880
that provided seamless automatic OS updates has gone away

03:50.880 --> 03:53.800
and now you are faced with a completely incompatible upgrade?

03:53.800 --> 03:55.520
Isn't there some rich irony to that?

03:55.520 --> 03:56.720
Oh, yeah.

03:56.720 --> 04:00.280
And I think the team at Fedora understands that too.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.240
They've got some sections here in the announcements

04:02.240 --> 04:03.440
like how do I migrate?

04:03.440 --> 04:04.280
What do I have to do?

04:04.280 --> 04:06.120
And what are the stability guarantees?

04:06.120 --> 04:09.760
And unfortunately, kind of just due to the way Fedora works,

04:09.760 --> 04:11.400
they're not in the same ballpark.

04:11.400 --> 04:15.720
And there's something else that's embedded in this story.

04:15.720 --> 04:20.240
This has all really been pitched as a positive thing

04:20.240 --> 04:23.200
because it's all been really about what's happening

04:23.200 --> 04:25.600
with Core OS when it goes over to Red Hat

04:25.600 --> 04:26.920
after the acquisition.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.800
Then the story became what happens with Fedora

04:29.800 --> 04:32.840
and their atomic version versus Core OS.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.120
And oh, isn't it funny that now it's Fedora Core again?

04:35.120 --> 04:38.160
Like all of this has been talked about a lot

04:38.160 --> 04:39.920
and then going from a preview

04:39.920 --> 04:41.720
to a general availability release

04:41.720 --> 04:44.360
and mastering images for AWS and whatnot

04:44.360 --> 04:47.520
has been all talked about fairly positively.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.400
But it sort of whitewashes over the reality

04:50.400 --> 04:53.400
of users that are left behind in a transition like this.

04:53.400 --> 04:54.960
And it particularly is stinging

04:54.960 --> 04:56.400
when it's enterprise grade software.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.560
Right, you've been paying for it

04:57.560 --> 04:59.600
and you're using container Linux.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.720
They get bought and now you have to change how you're,

05:02.720 --> 05:04.520
what infrastructure is running your business.

05:04.520 --> 05:05.840
Does this just sort of happen?

05:05.840 --> 05:07.600
Is this the way you roll the dice in the tech industry?

05:07.600 --> 05:09.920
Sometimes you bet on something that goes away

05:09.920 --> 05:12.640
and that's just how it rolls.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.800
Or is there something different we could be doing here?

05:15.800 --> 05:17.480
Well, I don't know about the,

05:18.520 --> 05:20.520
is there something different we could be doing?

05:20.520 --> 05:22.840
I think we need to put a bunch of smart people

05:22.840 --> 05:24.280
in the same room and solve that one.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.000
But it feels like this is just the reality

05:27.000 --> 05:28.640
of the tech industry.

05:28.640 --> 05:32.000
Like if you look at open source projects,

05:32.000 --> 05:32.840
that's certainly true.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.960
But even if you look at the proprietary stuff

05:34.960 --> 05:37.200
and corporations, you know, they change all the time.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.680
So it's almost like you have to expect

05:38.680 --> 05:42.320
that the landscape is just always unsure.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.440
Are always changing.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.160
Maybe that's the thing you can count on.

05:45.160 --> 05:48.120
And so I don't know.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.240
I wish I had a better answer, I guess.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.640
In all the history of software, computers and so forth,

05:53.640 --> 05:56.680
have we ever really had any true stability, really?

05:56.680 --> 05:58.240
I mean, so this is kind of expected

05:58.240 --> 05:59.520
in this industry entirely.

05:59.520 --> 06:04.200
I mean, I'm not an IT specialist,

06:04.200 --> 06:05.840
but dealing with the different

06:05.840 --> 06:08.440
product lifecycle management databases that I've used

06:08.440 --> 06:11.000
in my time at my employer,

06:11.000 --> 06:12.840
things just don't stay static.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.080
So there's always gonna be that pain of an upgrade.

06:15.080 --> 06:18.680
There's always gonna be that pain of a change of a vendor.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.440
So this is just par for the course.

06:20.440 --> 06:22.600
This is just the business we live in.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.600
Essentially comes with the territory, in other words.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.520
And I can't really disagree with that.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.320
And you could even make the argument

06:28.320 --> 06:31.680
that the platforms and areas that have remained

06:31.680 --> 06:35.360
the most stable in the terms of changes and development

06:35.360 --> 06:37.560
also come with some of the highest risk profiles.

06:37.560 --> 06:41.640
Like I'm thinking of x86 and Intel's architecture.

06:41.640 --> 06:43.800
It's been very consistent for a long time,

06:43.800 --> 06:46.760
but it's also now strapped with a legacy

06:46.760 --> 06:49.600
of baggage and vulnerabilities, same with Windows.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.760
So there's downsides to it as well to not doing this change.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.600
Yeah, that's true.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.960
And I mean, all these workloads are containerized, right?

06:55.960 --> 06:58.880
So you still have system and infrastructure configurations

06:58.880 --> 07:01.280
you need to change, but hopefully your applications

07:01.280 --> 07:02.680
can migrate a little bit easier.

07:02.680 --> 07:04.840
Absolutely, Wes, I totally agree.

07:04.840 --> 07:08.440
And I think if you look at Red Hat's strategy right now,

07:08.440 --> 07:12.920
OpenShift is their primary future kind of direction, right?

07:12.920 --> 07:15.800
And obviously Rel8's very important,

07:15.800 --> 07:19.680
but if you look at it from the enterprise adoption

07:19.680 --> 07:22.760
perspective of what can we start getting more people

07:22.760 --> 07:25.360
excited in, what can we start selling to people,

07:25.360 --> 07:28.000
all that kind of stuff that Red Hat unfortunately

07:28.000 --> 07:30.840
do to pay the bills, you know, selling stuff.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.040
That's gotta come from somewhere.

07:34.040 --> 07:37.920
And Fedora CoreOS is a key part of that, you know,

07:37.920 --> 07:39.560
without that kind of upstream route

07:39.560 --> 07:42.760
to feed into the CoreOS that is, you know,

07:42.760 --> 07:45.160
Red Hat CoreOS that ships with OpenShift.

07:46.840 --> 07:47.840
You know, where are you gonna get

07:47.840 --> 07:51.720
that kind of upstream feed from?

07:51.720 --> 07:53.120
So I think it's a necessary evil.

07:53.120 --> 07:56.840
You can't really have progress without change,

07:56.840 --> 07:59.240
as Tiger Wolf says in the IRC.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.840
Thank you, Alex, I appreciate that perspective.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.520
Bybit, and I wanted to give you a chance to jump in on this.

08:03.520 --> 08:06.840
Yeah, so we have a lot of change in technologies,

08:06.840 --> 08:10.920
and also if you look at Google, they create a technology,

08:10.920 --> 08:13.560
fuse it with others, and some technologies fall away.

08:13.560 --> 08:18.120
And that kind of forces us to innovate and move forward.

08:18.120 --> 08:22.400
So it is a kind of process and progress.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.240
Good point, thank you.

08:23.240 --> 08:24.920
All right, I don't really know.

08:24.920 --> 08:26.040
I think I feel better.

08:26.040 --> 08:29.840
It was a good conversation, and I'm sure the people

08:29.840 --> 08:33.760
that are running Container Linux from CoreOS,

08:33.760 --> 08:35.960
which is very, there's a lot of different names now,

08:35.960 --> 08:37.320
I'm sure they'll find a path forward.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.680
I mean, it's still a good sort of open source moment, right?

08:39.680 --> 08:41.440
Like you're right, this can happen to proprietary software.

08:41.440 --> 08:42.760
Things always change.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.200
You don't get free support for your products,

08:45.200 --> 08:47.600
but you do get the code, and that means, right?

08:47.600 --> 08:49.320
We can continue on, lots of stuff can happen,

08:49.320 --> 08:51.280
and you can still keep running yourself.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.920
And there's that whole, the way we communicate about it,

08:53.920 --> 08:55.400
like this whole aspect of the fact

08:55.400 --> 08:58.560
that there's all of these users getting left behind

08:58.560 --> 09:01.920
and gets left out of the coverage today

09:01.920 --> 09:04.840
because of the way coverage is engineered

09:04.840 --> 09:06.680
and done in this space.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.200
And as somebody who's in the space life,

09:08.200 --> 09:09.320
that's the aspect of the story

09:09.320 --> 09:11.480
that I find extremely fascinating.

09:11.480 --> 09:15.320
But we move on because there's a thought-provoking post

09:15.320 --> 09:18.680
over on Tobias Bernard's GNOME blog.

09:18.680 --> 09:22.200
And he posts over there semi-frequently

09:22.200 --> 09:24.680
talking about different aspects related to the future

09:24.680 --> 09:27.760
and present of GNOME Shell development.

09:27.760 --> 09:31.320
And he wrote a post titled, Doing Things That Scale.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.840
And it starts with an area

09:32.840 --> 09:35.360
that kind of rings really true to me,

09:35.360 --> 09:36.280
and I wanted to share it with you

09:36.280 --> 09:38.400
and kick it back and forth with Wes.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.600
He starts, there was a point in my life when I ran Arch.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.840
I had an elaborate personalized terminal prompt

09:43.840 --> 09:45.680
and my own custom icon theme.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.920
I stopped doing all of these things at various points

09:47.920 --> 09:49.520
for various different reasons,

09:49.520 --> 09:51.520
but underlying them all is a general feeling

09:51.520 --> 09:54.120
that it's taken me some time to figure out

09:54.120 --> 09:56.560
how to particularly articulate.

09:56.560 --> 10:01.560
I no longer want to invest time in things that don't scale.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.400
We will link to the full blog post

10:04.400 --> 10:06.120
because we're only gonna cut through

10:06.120 --> 10:07.400
some of the highlights here.

10:07.400 --> 10:10.720
But he continues, not only is it highly wasteful

10:10.720 --> 10:13.520
for me to come up with a custom solution to every problem,

10:13.520 --> 10:16.000
but in most cases, those solutions would be worse

10:16.000 --> 10:18.840
than the ones developed in collaboration with others.

10:19.760 --> 10:22.160
It also means nobody will help maintain the solutions

10:22.160 --> 10:23.720
in the long run.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.480
So I'll be stuck with extra work forever.

10:26.480 --> 10:29.040
Conversely, things that scale.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.360
A few examples that he cites

10:31.360 --> 10:33.800
is keeping things fairly simple.

10:34.680 --> 10:35.520
He says, until recently,

10:35.520 --> 10:36.960
I always set a custom monospace font

10:36.960 --> 10:40.400
in my editor and terminal when setting up a new machine.

10:40.400 --> 10:43.200
At some point though, I realized I wouldn't have to do that

10:43.200 --> 10:47.960
if the default was just nicer, so I just opened an issue.

10:47.960 --> 10:51.840
A discussion ensued and a better default was agreed upon

10:51.840 --> 10:56.520
and voila, my problem was solved.

10:56.520 --> 10:59.600
So far, this really rings true for me.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.880
It resonates, it ringzonates for me, Wes.

11:01.880 --> 11:03.080
Does it ringzonate for you?

11:03.080 --> 11:04.880
Yeah, you know, I certainly agree

11:04.880 --> 11:07.520
that sometimes the defaults are the reason

11:07.520 --> 11:09.680
that you need to go spend some more time and customize.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.720
Now, I think you can do both in some of this, right?

11:12.720 --> 11:14.760
Like you can go try to get a better default,

11:14.760 --> 11:16.480
but even if the font is better,

11:16.480 --> 11:18.880
you might still prefer your own custom font.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.720
And fonts seem like the least applicable part of this.

11:21.720 --> 11:22.600
Like, yes, we should do that.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.520
But I do think the idea of,

11:24.520 --> 11:26.440
if you want your tools to be better,

11:26.440 --> 11:29.440
if you can see how those could be better, that's valuable.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.440
That's worth contributing

11:30.440 --> 11:33.440
because you can be a developer working on a project

11:33.440 --> 11:37.000
that you might not know what the users think is best for them.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.720
And to that point, you remember recently,

11:39.720 --> 11:42.040
we did that Plasma live stream

11:42.040 --> 11:44.360
where we went through how I customized the Plasma desktop

11:44.360 --> 11:46.080
and Jonathan Riddle and a few others

11:46.080 --> 11:47.440
from the Plasma team watched it.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.480
They're like, you know, we're taking some notes.

11:48.480 --> 11:51.120
These might just be some defaults we tweaked for you.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.760
We didn't really think that, you know, that's a good idea.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.240
That is, first of all, rare and incredible,

11:56.240 --> 11:58.360
but it is truly, to your point,

11:58.360 --> 12:00.440
like they're different use cases.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.480
They have different uses.

12:01.480 --> 12:02.320
They use it differently.

12:02.320 --> 12:04.840
They can't necessarily articulate in their mind

12:04.840 --> 12:06.400
all the different various ways

12:06.400 --> 12:07.480
that most people might want to use it.

12:07.480 --> 12:09.120
And so seeing different use cases and,

12:09.120 --> 12:10.160
oh, that does make sense.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.640
It gives them an opportunity.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.640
Where things kind of go off the rails here with me

12:15.720 --> 12:17.360
is the next part of the post here.

12:17.360 --> 12:21.800
Because I think it really, for me, touches on that nerve.

12:21.800 --> 12:26.120
I push back on a few fundamental assumptions

12:26.120 --> 12:27.920
of the rest of the Linux community.

12:27.920 --> 12:31.400
And I feel like I am on an island onto myself

12:31.400 --> 12:33.040
in which I say something

12:33.040 --> 12:35.040
and people just think I'm a nutter.

12:35.040 --> 12:39.040
And number one is I don't think Linux is for everyone.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.080
Full front, I don't think it's necessarily great

12:41.080 --> 12:42.880
for everyone to use Linux.

12:42.880 --> 12:44.640
Not right now, not yet.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.480
Number two, and quite frankly, is I don't think

12:47.480 --> 12:51.640
what's hurting and holding Linux back is a marketing issue.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.880
It's so much bigger than that.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.560
It's so much bigger than that.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.520
It comes down to corporate structures.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.560
It comes down to agreements.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.640
It comes down to ecosystems.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.280
It comes down to market demand

13:01.280 --> 13:03.320
and consumer willingness to switch.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.360
It's a massive issue.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.000
And when you take it all in,

13:07.000 --> 13:08.160
when you really think about it,

13:08.160 --> 13:10.960
when you go have yourself a hike and you think about it,

13:10.960 --> 13:14.880
you realize there is a narrow niche.

13:16.440 --> 13:19.360
Thankfully and amazingly, that niche,

13:19.360 --> 13:20.920
and I've witnessed it and you've witnessed it,

13:20.920 --> 13:23.880
has expanded over the last few years.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.560
Incredibly now, just at an even more

13:26.560 --> 13:28.080
accelerated rate than ever.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.760
But there's a narrow niche of people

13:30.760 --> 13:34.680
that are gonna have a truly successful transition to Linux.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.880
We're joking ourselves if we think Windows 7 users

13:36.880 --> 13:38.120
are all switching to Linux.

13:38.120 --> 13:40.120
Maybe some of them, some in the engineering and science

13:40.120 --> 13:42.840
and some in the engineering and scientific fields, I bet.

13:42.840 --> 13:47.600
So when I see that we should fundamentally limit

13:47.600 --> 13:50.200
the technical capabilities of our systems

13:50.200 --> 13:52.120
so that way they're, quote, scalable

13:53.600 --> 13:55.880
and easier for average people to maintain,

13:56.760 --> 13:58.040
I kind of put my hand up and go,

13:58.040 --> 13:59.320
can we talk about this for a moment?

13:59.320 --> 14:01.120
Because some of these make a lot of sense,

14:01.120 --> 14:03.160
but some of them don't.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.720
Like dropping separate home partitions,

14:05.720 --> 14:07.320
dropping dot files,

14:07.320 --> 14:09.640
dropping multiple Firefox profiles,

14:09.640 --> 14:11.240
dropping encryption,

14:12.560 --> 14:14.200
dropping email backups.

14:14.200 --> 14:15.400
These kinds of things I appreciate

14:15.400 --> 14:17.480
are hard for users to manage,

14:17.480 --> 14:21.680
but I think my fundamental argument would be

14:21.680 --> 14:26.320
the niche that Linux is actually really applicable to,

14:26.320 --> 14:28.040
those are nice features to have.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.200
That user base does care about those things.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.840
Because I picture it to be software developers,

14:34.840 --> 14:39.600
engineers, geeks, hobbyists, creatives,

14:39.600 --> 14:42.320
people who tend to really care

14:42.320 --> 14:43.880
about the state of their tools,

14:43.880 --> 14:46.080
because that's a tool to do a job.

14:46.080 --> 14:50.560
And I just don't agree with limiting the system

14:50.560 --> 14:53.880
to make it appealing to a fantasy user base

14:53.880 --> 14:55.680
that you can't even articulate.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.640
It's a nebulous concept.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.840
The new user to Linux is a nebulous concept

14:59.840 --> 15:02.560
that each one of us has a version of in our heads.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.720
I think you are hitting here.

15:03.720 --> 15:05.960
I mean, there's a lot that's going unspoken.

15:05.960 --> 15:07.720
One, the definition of scale

15:07.720 --> 15:09.440
that we're using for this conversation.

15:09.440 --> 15:11.640
And you're right, I think it's easy to take this

15:11.640 --> 15:13.400
as an intent to limit.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.640
And that's where it gets really tricky

15:14.640 --> 15:16.360
because as existing Linux users,

15:16.360 --> 15:17.680
we love that configuration, right?

15:17.680 --> 15:20.120
We love the ability to automate, to interface,

15:20.120 --> 15:22.240
to customize our solutions, to fit our need,

15:22.240 --> 15:23.960
because it's a tool we're heavily invested in.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.520
Yeah, how many times have you heard the mantra,

15:25.520 --> 15:26.600
it's so flexible?

15:26.600 --> 15:27.440
Right.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.600
And I think what this article is trying to point out

15:29.600 --> 15:30.440
is that-

15:30.440 --> 15:31.280
There's too much of that.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.360
There's too much of that.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.640
And where it's tricky is you try to get both, right?

15:34.640 --> 15:36.240
We've all had tools where you're like,

15:36.240 --> 15:38.160
I wish that there was an escape hatch in this tool

15:38.160 --> 15:39.600
because it works 80% of the time,

15:39.600 --> 15:41.480
but I need to make one little change.

15:41.480 --> 15:42.480
And the reverse is also true,

15:42.480 --> 15:44.280
where you're like, I could use Handbrake

15:44.280 --> 15:45.880
or I could use FFmpeg.

15:45.880 --> 15:48.080
One, maybe I don't have all the options I want,

15:48.080 --> 15:49.440
and the other, I have to go cobble together

15:49.440 --> 15:51.880
my whole bespoke custom solution.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.680
It's hard to figure out what's in the middle of there

15:53.680 --> 15:55.560
that works for both of those use cases.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.240
I'll tell you what fits in the middle, Wes.

15:57.240 --> 16:00.040
And that's, I know this is a Linux podcast

16:00.040 --> 16:03.080
and I'm almost afraid to say it, but Mac OS.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.240
You know, that fits in the middle for a lot of people.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.720
It has a decent terminal.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.800
It can run the Adobe suite.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.400
You've heard all these arguments before.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.240
It's nothing-

16:12.240 --> 16:13.080
It's not Windows.

16:13.080 --> 16:13.960
Yeah, there's nothing revolutionary

16:13.960 --> 16:14.880
in what I'm saying here.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.160
It's just, it just gets the job done.

16:17.160 --> 16:19.000
You're actually kind of making

16:19.000 --> 16:20.560
what my next point was going to be,

16:20.560 --> 16:24.440
is I feel like if we go too far in this direction,

16:24.440 --> 16:26.160
we're Mac-ifying the Linux desktop

16:26.160 --> 16:31.160
to a degree that just makes us a also brand to Mac OS.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.920
I wouldn't necessarily object to that,

16:34.920 --> 16:37.160
but then I suppose you could argue

16:37.160 --> 16:38.840
that that's what elementary OS is.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.360
Or at least attempting to replicate

16:40.360 --> 16:44.240
some of the successful aspects of what makes the Mac work.

16:44.240 --> 16:49.240
But I think if you limit some of this,

16:49.520 --> 16:53.760
what you really are left with is idealism,

16:53.760 --> 16:56.600
people who want to use the software for moral reasons,

16:57.960 --> 16:59.040
and people who would be running

16:59.040 --> 17:00.360
their own custom desktop environments

17:00.360 --> 17:02.640
that don't have anything to do with this whole stack.

17:03.840 --> 17:06.080
But from like a market competitive analysis,

17:06.080 --> 17:08.800
say I'm, I was just watching,

17:08.800 --> 17:09.720
I can't remember his name right now,

17:09.720 --> 17:11.360
maybe somebody in the Mumble or the chat remembers,

17:11.360 --> 17:14.800
but a YouTuber just posted, oh no, surprise,

17:14.800 --> 17:19.800
a very good video where he built a Pop OS workstation

17:20.320 --> 17:22.440
to run DaVinci Resolve.

17:22.440 --> 17:25.920
And he compared it to a Hackintosh and Windows

17:25.920 --> 17:28.680
and the new Mac Pro, because he has one of those as well.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.840
So I actually found it right around, right at my alley,

17:30.840 --> 17:33.320
because this is my head-to-head kind of battle.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.520
And he clearly was new to Linux,

17:36.520 --> 17:38.440
clearly new to the whole system,

17:38.440 --> 17:40.760
but figured out his way after looking at different options

17:40.760 --> 17:42.960
of getting to Pop OS and then getting a way

17:42.960 --> 17:45.720
to convert the RPM to a deb

17:45.720 --> 17:48.280
so he could install DaVinci and get it all working.

17:48.280 --> 17:51.880
He even got the hardware proprietary dongle stuff set up

17:51.880 --> 17:54.800
and had very positive things to say about it.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.640
Just after watching that, I looked at it and thought,

17:56.640 --> 17:58.240
there's a real market here for somebody

17:58.240 --> 18:00.400
who wants to build a custom system

18:00.400 --> 18:02.280
with a set amount of hardware that they need,

18:02.280 --> 18:04.600
maybe it's disk, maybe it's GPU,

18:04.600 --> 18:09.680
and they have a budget and it's less than $35,000,

18:09.680 --> 18:11.000
it really worked for him.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.440
And he liked some of the power,

18:12.440 --> 18:15.160
like Gnome Shell was really hitting that sweet spot for him

18:15.160 --> 18:16.840
because it wasn't too complicated,

18:16.840 --> 18:18.440
but he could tell it gave him more

18:18.440 --> 18:19.840
than what he got from the Mac.

18:19.840 --> 18:20.680
Right, that's it.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.080
That's kind of the best case that we could hope for.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.680
And I think that's maybe some of the spirit

18:23.680 --> 18:25.440
that this article is intending,

18:25.440 --> 18:27.080
that better defaults,

18:27.080 --> 18:28.280
maybe not focusing on the limiting part,

18:28.280 --> 18:31.200
but better defaults can help new users and existing users.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.440
So sometimes I just need to test the latest Fedora out

18:33.440 --> 18:34.880
and if Gnome looks great,

18:34.880 --> 18:36.480
that means I don't have to change anything.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.920
Would you agree that it's probably never actually

18:38.920 --> 18:42.440
going to be possible to target the quote, new users,

18:42.440 --> 18:44.800
unquote, because like, if you think about it,

18:44.800 --> 18:47.200
everyone kind of has different expectations

18:47.200 --> 18:48.240
coming into something.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.360
So whether that's someone

18:49.360 --> 18:52.160
who is fairly technologically savvy

18:52.160 --> 18:54.800
or, you know, grandma down the street,

18:54.800 --> 18:57.240
I feel like it's really hard to define

18:57.240 --> 18:59.600
what the perfect situation is

18:59.600 --> 19:02.240
for the quote unquote, new user.

19:02.240 --> 19:05.680
I could see two potential types of new users.

19:05.680 --> 19:08.400
I should probably address this.

19:08.400 --> 19:09.240
So thank you for asking

19:09.240 --> 19:10.920
because I don't want to make it sound like I'm saying blah,

19:10.920 --> 19:12.080
don't make Linux for any users

19:12.080 --> 19:15.800
because we have to keep expanding that niche.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.400
We have to keep marching forward.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.000
And the only way to get there is by people working on it.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.800
It's just, we don't want to sacrifice

19:21.800 --> 19:25.040
what makes it so great for the thousands

19:25.040 --> 19:26.480
and millions of people's pulling in right now.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.960
You know, we're about to talk about the XPS 13.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.240
Dell is very intentional in their targeting

19:31.240 --> 19:33.520
of the developer market with the Sputnik.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.560
And I think that's a clear strategy

19:36.560 --> 19:37.600
that's working for them.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.480
And they didn't just go for like new users.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.240
They didn't go for a best buy blitz.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.360
They just focused on developers

19:44.360 --> 19:46.760
with a low key marketing campaign.

19:46.760 --> 19:49.120
And I think that's telling.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.000
And maybe you could see in 10 years,

19:51.000 --> 19:53.560
they do have something that's on a best buy shelf

19:53.560 --> 19:56.240
because it has, that niche has expanded over time.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.440
So that's one type of user,

19:57.440 --> 19:59.840
just as the niche expands, it'll pull them in.

19:59.840 --> 20:01.680
I think the other type is,

20:01.680 --> 20:04.520
and I'm sure a lot of people listening have done this,

20:04.520 --> 20:07.440
family members, friends, associates, whatever,

20:07.440 --> 20:09.120
where you set them up a Linux system

20:09.120 --> 20:10.600
and you just kind of check in on it for them

20:10.600 --> 20:11.480
from time to time.

20:12.480 --> 20:13.720
Like my son, famously,

20:13.720 --> 20:15.280
I talk about it all the time on the show.

20:15.280 --> 20:18.400
My son has been running Linux for like five years now

20:18.400 --> 20:20.840
and it's no big deal at all.

20:20.840 --> 20:22.080
In fact, I very rarely even,

20:22.080 --> 20:24.480
he mostly just does the updates and all of that.

20:24.480 --> 20:27.080
And I've done it with family members in the past

20:27.080 --> 20:29.080
for a few years or more.

20:29.080 --> 20:33.000
And typically I'll just pick something that is reliable

20:33.000 --> 20:35.880
and I just can do updates every three to six months

20:35.880 --> 20:36.880
when I see them.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.560
Or most districts now just say,

20:39.560 --> 20:40.600
hey, you need to do an update

20:40.600 --> 20:42.240
and I've just told them, go ahead and do them.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.200
And it works.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.040
And it works.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.120
And with a little bit of help,

20:45.120 --> 20:46.360
with a little bit of management,

20:46.360 --> 20:49.120
and of course there's the corporate user

20:49.120 --> 20:51.760
where they are just given a workstation

20:51.760 --> 20:53.120
and they could be new users to it.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.400
So we still need to make it usable.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.800
I'm not advocating for not making it usable.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.000
I'm just advocating for being realistic

21:02.000 --> 21:05.320
about who we're appealing to as just a direct product.

21:05.320 --> 21:08.440
And to be conscious as we change, as we must,

21:08.440 --> 21:11.040
to keep some respect for the culture that we've had.

21:11.040 --> 21:14.880
Yeah, and those that are advocating that

21:14.880 --> 21:17.800
have to also be willing to compromise on those positions

21:17.800 --> 21:19.160
as things change.

21:19.160 --> 21:20.000
Very true.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.120
And I think that's something to keep in mind too.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.640
It's not a call to arms.

21:22.640 --> 21:25.560
It's a call to further conversation.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.440
How about that?

21:26.440 --> 21:28.680
Jeez, that's just, they should take that.

21:28.680 --> 21:30.840
They should just take that and run with it.

21:30.840 --> 21:32.360
So I will put a link to that YouTube video

21:32.360 --> 21:34.360
because while we were talking, I did find it.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.520
And I just think it was super great.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.440
I had been watching this guy for a little bit

21:38.440 --> 21:39.680
because I liked his style.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.440
And then to see that video drop, I was like,

21:41.440 --> 21:42.720
wow, that's awesome.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.600
And it's so cool because he didn't even know

21:44.600 --> 21:46.320
to position it as Linux e-clickbait

21:46.320 --> 21:47.800
because he's not a Linux guy.

21:47.800 --> 21:48.640
Of course.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.240
And so I didn't even really know for sure

21:50.240 --> 21:51.200
it was a Linux video.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.840
And then I'm like, oh man, he could have totally titled

21:53.840 --> 21:55.960
this differently if he knew what he was doing.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.960
Like the clickbait voice that's sometimes

21:57.960 --> 21:58.960
in the back of my head.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.840
Of course.

22:00.840 --> 22:04.080
I think whenever we were talking about Linux and the user

22:04.080 --> 22:07.880
space and making it easier for entry level users

22:07.880 --> 22:11.760
or maybe that person that's an IT professional who's always

22:11.760 --> 22:14.040
been in a Microsoft Windows environment switching over

22:14.040 --> 22:16.520
to Linux and things like that, I think one of the things

22:16.520 --> 22:18.600
that we really have to consider too

22:18.600 --> 22:21.760
is that Linux is really the kernel.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.760
And then the user space below that

22:23.760 --> 22:26.200
is ours to do with what we want.

22:26.200 --> 22:30.080
So different distros can target that different ways.

22:30.080 --> 22:34.840
They can make a very user friendly entry level kind

22:34.840 --> 22:35.880
of user.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.280
Like Chrome OS, for example.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.360
Exactly.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.480
Or you can make it as deep as you want.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.240
You can arch it up.

22:42.240 --> 22:44.840
You can Linux from scratch.

22:44.840 --> 22:51.120
So I don't think there's one particular, like you said,

22:51.120 --> 22:55.120
I think there's this fantasy user that they're

22:55.120 --> 22:58.600
kind of perceiving is going to move into the Linux space.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.820
And unlike all of these other available operating systems

23:01.820 --> 23:08.760
like Mac OS or Windows, it's not like anyone has a stand up

23:08.760 --> 23:12.440
and says, hey, UI, UX developers,

23:12.440 --> 23:15.240
let's target this for Linux.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.040
You have distributions that do that.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.440
Elementary has done a great job with it.

23:19.440 --> 23:22.000
Fedora has done a fantastic job with it.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.040
But that same conversation is going

23:24.040 --> 23:27.080
to be completely different if that stand up was

23:27.080 --> 23:30.320
with the Arch developers or the Manjaro developers.

23:30.320 --> 23:32.000
They're going to look at that completely

23:32.000 --> 23:35.460
different than the way the normal layman would.

23:35.460 --> 23:38.920
I think your point's well made too that the eventual new user

23:38.920 --> 23:43.600
product will be something that is assembled using Linux

23:43.600 --> 23:47.560
but is not likely just a raw ISO that has been flashed

23:47.560 --> 23:51.120
to a thumb drive and then thrown on an x86 compatible or ARM

23:51.120 --> 23:52.160
compatible system.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.520
It's going to be your Chromebook.

23:53.520 --> 23:56.700
It's going to be something that's packaged up and ready

23:56.700 --> 23:57.200
to go.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.400
Or I mean, maybe it'll be, who knows?

24:00.400 --> 24:01.320
I'd love to see this.

24:01.320 --> 24:04.880
I'd love to see just vanilla Linux systems on good hardware,

24:04.880 --> 24:06.560
especially with some of the improvements

24:06.560 --> 24:08.480
we see coming to the Ubuntu desktop.

24:08.480 --> 24:11.480
The next update makes it look very pro.

24:11.480 --> 24:15.920
We have Ubuntu 2004 installed on the XPS 13.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.940
We wanted to spend the last couple of days

24:17.940 --> 24:20.520
on the latest Ubuntu to see what it's like on this XPS 13.

24:20.520 --> 24:22.720
And one of the things that has come out

24:22.720 --> 24:25.280
of a recent get together by the canonical folk,

24:25.280 --> 24:29.360
like our buddies Wimpy and Popy, is a really nice new theme.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.520
So you remember Yaru, right?

24:30.520 --> 24:31.520
Of course.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.840
I think it's been the default since 1810.

24:33.840 --> 24:34.760
Right.

24:34.760 --> 24:38.180
And now it's getting a big update in 2004.

24:38.180 --> 24:40.360
And we got it installed on the XPS 13.

24:40.360 --> 24:42.720
And it's very gorgeous.

24:42.720 --> 24:46.560
I think it might be my favorite theme, specifically

24:46.560 --> 24:47.880
the purple touches.

24:47.880 --> 24:48.640
I don't know.

24:48.640 --> 24:49.680
Dark theme with purple.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.880
It's one of those themes where I've set it.

24:51.880 --> 24:54.200
And I've been using Yaru even on my arch systems

24:54.200 --> 24:55.080
now for a while.

24:55.080 --> 24:56.400
Once I set it, I'm good.

24:56.400 --> 24:57.320
Yeah, it's really nice.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.480
Checkboxes, radio buttons, and switches

24:59.480 --> 25:01.160
all have little hints of purple.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.640
I think actually really it's eggplant.

25:03.640 --> 25:04.400
Oh my gosh.

25:04.400 --> 25:05.280
Thanks, Wes.

25:05.280 --> 25:05.800
Thanks.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.220
I think you're right.

25:07.220 --> 25:07.840
Yeah.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.920
Oh, it's poppy and wimpy.

25:10.920 --> 25:14.840
So it's probably actually taken from the emoji.

25:14.840 --> 25:16.960
You know these guys and their emojis.

25:16.960 --> 25:18.960
You know what else is exciting about this, though?

25:18.960 --> 25:21.000
Do you remember like 10 years ago, back in like,

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
won't you, 1004?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.340
I don't even remember last week.

25:23.340 --> 25:26.360
With like radiance and ambiance and those things.

25:26.360 --> 25:29.880
So those had light and dark variations of the same theme,

25:29.880 --> 25:30.640
right?

25:30.640 --> 25:32.600
Way back when you could sort of customize it,

25:32.600 --> 25:34.000
have the dark version, have the light version.

25:34.000 --> 25:34.640
We don't believe you.

25:34.640 --> 25:35.160
Yeah, right?

25:35.160 --> 25:36.720
Well, that's coming back now, too.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.360
So now you're going to have Yaru dark, light,

25:39.360 --> 25:40.200
and the regular Yaru.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.280
Oh, if it wasn't clear, we are dark mode on that.

25:42.280 --> 25:42.760
Oh, OK.

25:42.760 --> 25:43.040
I see.

25:43.040 --> 25:43.280
I see.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.960
You just weren't even considering the other options.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.720
I mean, I tried it this morning because Wes was playing around

25:47.720 --> 25:49.000
with it yesterday on 2004.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.840
So I grabbed it this morning to play around with on 2004.

25:51.840 --> 25:55.600
And first thing I did was just check

25:55.600 --> 25:58.800
to see if yet they had baked something into Gnome settings

25:58.800 --> 26:00.260
so I could just go select it there.

26:00.260 --> 26:00.760
Good news.

26:00.760 --> 26:01.400
That's coming.

26:01.400 --> 26:02.960
Ah, it's not there yet.

26:02.960 --> 26:03.600
Yeah.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.280
You still got to use Gnome tweaks.

26:06.280 --> 26:09.000
It was installed, so.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.280
Oh, you know what that means.

26:10.280 --> 26:11.840
It's time for a little housekeeping here

26:11.840 --> 26:13.120
on the old podcast keys.

26:13.120 --> 26:16.400
I already mentioned it, but I have a note to mention it again.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.640
No Linux Unplugged Live next week.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.120
We'll have an episode for you.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.120
So this episode is all about hardware.

26:22.120 --> 26:23.360
Well, it's about to be.

26:23.360 --> 26:26.440
Next episode is going to be about software.

26:26.440 --> 26:27.660
Really looking forward to it.

26:27.660 --> 26:28.920
So bring your time machine.

26:28.920 --> 26:29.320
Yeah.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.720
And maybe this is a good time to go make sure you're subscribed

26:31.720 --> 26:34.000
in all the places you want to easily get the podcast.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.640
LinuxUnplugged.com slash subscribe for those.

26:37.640 --> 26:39.040
You might remember we mentioned we

26:39.040 --> 26:41.040
were doing a live stream on using

26:41.040 --> 26:43.920
the terminal like your desktop.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.640
A day in the life of cheese.

26:45.640 --> 26:46.640
And it turned out great.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.360
So it's up on YouTube now, YouTube.com

26:48.360 --> 26:50.120
slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.760
You can go watch it over there.

26:51.760 --> 26:55.360
Cheese and myself just doing our thing on the live stream.

26:55.360 --> 26:55.880
Yeah.

26:55.880 --> 26:59.420
And we got some really solid feedback too in the comments.

26:59.420 --> 27:02.040
And I would suggest to anyone that's listening that ventures

27:02.040 --> 27:03.160
over there to watch the video.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.760
If you have any terminal applications

27:04.760 --> 27:08.160
that you really swear by and use every day,

27:08.160 --> 27:09.280
drop them in the comments.

27:09.280 --> 27:12.240
Because there's been some really excellent suggestions in there.

27:12.240 --> 27:12.960
I love that.

27:12.960 --> 27:13.880
That's great.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.720
Did you see that Alex is on the Home Assistant podcast?

27:16.720 --> 27:18.760
Go check out Alex on the Home Assistant podcast.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.380
He did his thing over there representing

27:20.380 --> 27:22.840
the self-hosted program.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.600
One of the reasons, well, the reason

27:24.600 --> 27:26.960
we're not live next week is I'm taking

27:26.960 --> 27:31.080
Lady Joops down for a major project off-grid update

27:31.080 --> 27:33.480
doing the solar, doing the lithium,

27:33.480 --> 27:35.000
redoing the entire power system.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.240
Talking a little bit about that on self-hosted.

27:37.240 --> 27:40.040
So check out self-hosted.show if you're not listening to that.

27:40.040 --> 27:43.720
Also rumor has it that I'm going to be going on the show

27:43.720 --> 27:48.000
again in a couple of weeks to do a deep dive into my setup,

27:48.000 --> 27:49.680
even deeper than we do in self-hosted.

27:49.680 --> 27:52.200
So even more Home Assistant.

27:52.200 --> 27:53.200
Watch out for that.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.040
Nice.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.200
Good for you.

27:55.200 --> 27:58.080
And speaking of great content you can catch,

27:58.080 --> 28:01.040
our man Brent sits down with Mr. Jim Salter of the Techsnap

28:01.040 --> 28:02.240
program in Ars Technica.

28:02.240 --> 28:05.880
He was on our show here recently in the latest episode of Brunch

28:05.880 --> 28:09.640
with Brent over on extras.show.

28:09.640 --> 28:10.960
I love Brunch.

28:10.960 --> 28:14.720
I want chats with Chris, dinner with Drew,

28:14.720 --> 28:17.480
and we need something for you, Wes.

28:17.480 --> 28:18.880
Something about drinks with Wes?

28:18.880 --> 28:20.040
No, that's not it.

28:20.040 --> 28:20.880
Wine with Wes?

28:20.880 --> 28:21.600
Oh, there we go.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.200
That'll work.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.040
And then a special note.

28:26.040 --> 28:29.000
Special programming note, everybody.

28:29.000 --> 28:33.160
Texas Linux Fest has extended their call for papers

28:33.160 --> 28:38.640
until this Sunday, my birthday, January 26 at 5 PM,

28:38.640 --> 28:41.000
their time, which is central time.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.040
So you've got a couple more days.

28:43.040 --> 28:46.240
Remember, you don't have to have the perfect, fully done talk.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.080
You just need a great pitch, a good summary,

28:48.080 --> 28:49.700
and an idea of where you're going to take it.

28:49.700 --> 28:53.360
And then you use now until the Fest to make it just right.

28:53.360 --> 28:54.160
Yeah.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.520
And as long as you get it finished by the Fest,

28:55.520 --> 28:56.280
no one will know.

28:56.280 --> 28:56.880
We're going to be there.

28:56.880 --> 28:57.440
Are you going to be there?

28:57.440 --> 28:57.920
I can't remember.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.320
Yeah, of course.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.280
Oh my gosh, great.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.480
And Alex is going to be there, and Brent's going to be there,

29:02.480 --> 29:03.720
and Cheesy.

29:03.720 --> 29:04.400
Absolutely.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.920
I'm sure L, of course.

29:06.920 --> 29:08.720
Carl's going to be there, of course.

29:08.720 --> 29:09.640
Yes, sir.

29:09.640 --> 29:12.760
And it's going to be in Austin again this year, so barbecue.

29:12.760 --> 29:14.080
What?

29:14.080 --> 29:14.680
Yes.

29:14.680 --> 29:17.280
Carl, we've got to make that happen because Hadia

29:17.280 --> 29:20.360
has been giving me two years of crap for not taking it.

29:20.360 --> 29:21.680
The marriage is on the line.

29:21.680 --> 29:22.280
It's important.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.200
Hey, Carl, is it in the venue across the road

29:24.200 --> 29:25.280
from Terry Black's?

29:25.280 --> 29:26.120
Did that happen?

29:26.120 --> 29:26.800
Yes, sir.

29:26.800 --> 29:29.080
We're going to be smelling it from the Fest.

29:29.080 --> 29:30.960
You know that because they pump all that.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.440
Oh my gosh, you guys.

29:32.440 --> 29:33.280
So there you have it.

29:33.280 --> 29:37.320
Texas Linux Fest call for papers extended until this here Sunday

29:37.320 --> 29:39.720
as we record, so go check that out.

29:39.720 --> 29:42.960
And then Linux Fest, Scale, and Texas Linux Fest,

29:42.960 --> 29:45.680
all coming up scale first, right?

29:45.680 --> 29:47.720
Then Linux Fest, then Texas Linux Fest.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.240
Right now, we're planning to go to all of them if we can,

29:50.240 --> 29:52.440
so we hope to see you there.

29:52.440 --> 29:53.080
Who knows?

29:53.080 --> 29:54.180
Will plans change?

29:54.180 --> 29:55.600
I don't know.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.040
I don't got a magic eight ball.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.400
You lost the magic eight ball?

29:58.400 --> 29:58.920
Come on.

29:58.920 --> 29:59.600
I trusted you.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.480
I let my kids play with it.

30:01.480 --> 30:04.280
They asked all kinds of questions, mostly about farts.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.280
So Wes, do we have the hardware in here?

30:06.280 --> 30:06.800
Yeah, we do.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.000
It's actually at your feet.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.520
Oh, yeah, there it is.

30:09.520 --> 30:14.040
So we're talking about the XPS 13 7390.

30:14.040 --> 30:17.640
This is no longer the absolute latest.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.780
Although, can you order the brand, brand new one

30:19.780 --> 30:20.760
that was announced at CBS?

30:20.760 --> 30:22.400
I don't know if it's shipping.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.680
It's on Dell's website.

30:23.680 --> 30:25.560
I'm not sure when you'll actually receive it.

30:25.560 --> 30:28.080
We wondered, is there still a point to this laptop,

30:28.080 --> 30:28.680
number one?

30:28.680 --> 30:31.840
And number two, where has the XPS line gotten to?

30:31.840 --> 30:35.040
Because something that is extremely important to me

30:35.040 --> 30:39.040
when I'm investing in a hardware platform

30:39.040 --> 30:40.640
is I really like to have insurance

30:40.640 --> 30:43.240
that that platform will get better over time.

30:43.240 --> 30:45.680
And that, say, after I've used a laptop for three or four

30:45.680 --> 30:49.640
years, I can buy another one of that same generation,

30:49.640 --> 30:51.600
and it's iteratively gotten better.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.640
Right, it's no fun having to jump brands each time

30:53.640 --> 30:54.600
you need a new laptop.

30:54.600 --> 30:56.160
I mean, we saw how upset the Mac users got

30:56.160 --> 30:58.080
when the MacBook suffered there for a few years.

30:58.080 --> 30:59.320
And they've really only gotten one good one.

30:59.320 --> 30:59.840
That's right.

30:59.840 --> 31:00.440
Let's be clear.

31:00.440 --> 31:03.360
There's only one that's got a fixed keyboard, for heck's sake.

31:03.360 --> 31:06.320
Anyways, I really think you can say

31:06.320 --> 31:08.000
that is true for the XPS 13 line.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
Yeah, we've both been using them over the years,

31:10.000 --> 31:12.360
and there hasn't been a huge regression.

31:12.360 --> 31:15.440
You and I both have been and are XPS owners.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.520
Not our daily drivers, but still really great.

31:18.520 --> 31:22.000
My wife uses an XPS 13 as her main computer.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.800
She loves the portability of it.

31:23.800 --> 31:24.840
Great screen.

31:24.840 --> 31:25.840
That's always been true.

31:25.840 --> 31:28.480
So where are they at now, and where is it at performance-wise?

31:28.480 --> 31:31.280
Well, like we mentioned, we recently launched this.

31:31.280 --> 31:35.720
We came with, I believe, 1804, and we messed around

31:35.720 --> 31:38.000
with a couple of different distributions.

31:38.000 --> 31:41.200
We finally just put Ubuntu 20.04 on here for fun.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.520
But something kind of hit me right in the face

31:44.520 --> 31:46.720
when I first started playing around with this thing,

31:46.720 --> 31:49.280
as I had some trouble booting other Linux distributions

31:49.280 --> 31:49.960
on there.

31:49.960 --> 31:51.600
It's this newfangled hardware, Wes.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.160
What exactly was going on with that?

31:53.160 --> 31:55.320
Well, there was fast boot enabled.

31:55.320 --> 31:56.920
Basically, the default BIOS settings

31:56.920 --> 32:00.400
made it very difficult to get a USB drive recognized.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.440
First of all, it's only USB-C ports on this thing.

32:02.440 --> 32:03.240
It's default BIOS, you say?

32:03.240 --> 32:04.040
Yeah, that's right.

32:04.040 --> 32:06.840
Now, it's UEFI now, Chris.

32:06.840 --> 32:08.040
UEFI?

32:08.040 --> 32:08.840
Is that a worm?

32:08.840 --> 32:10.520
So you're going to live the dongle lifestyle, right?

32:10.520 --> 32:12.760
So you got your little USB-C to USB-A adapter.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.600
You've plugged in your Linux distribution.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.600
You're hoping it's going to boot, and you just get Ubuntu

32:17.600 --> 32:18.120
again.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.120
Yeah, you get kind of weird stuff, actually,

32:20.120 --> 32:21.760
depending on the distribution.

32:21.760 --> 32:25.800
In elementary, I got the elementary OS splash screen,

32:25.800 --> 32:27.920
and it started booting elementary OS.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.800
And then when the splash screen disappeared,

32:29.800 --> 32:31.920
I was in an Ubuntu desktop.

32:31.920 --> 32:33.640
It was the strangest thing.

32:33.640 --> 32:36.000
And then when I booted Manjaro on it,

32:36.000 --> 32:39.960
I had really kind of strange mouse glitchy issues.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.520
But all of that kind of I just attributed

32:41.520 --> 32:42.880
to the thing being so dang new.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.800
But after you solved it, it was really kind of no big deal

32:45.800 --> 32:46.520
at all.

32:46.520 --> 32:49.040
Yeah, I spent most of my time with it running Arch,

32:49.040 --> 32:51.200
and it was performing great.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.720
I love that you put Arch on it.

32:52.720 --> 32:53.920
You're such a maniac.

32:53.920 --> 32:56.880
So like we said, this is now no longer

32:56.880 --> 32:59.240
the most latest and greatest edition.

32:59.240 --> 33:03.320
They have one that has been just announced at CES.

33:03.320 --> 33:06.240
So we called up Dell, and we said, hey, guys,

33:06.240 --> 33:09.760
what's the difference between this here laptop

33:09.760 --> 33:10.600
and the new one?

33:10.600 --> 33:11.840
What's the big difference?

33:11.840 --> 33:15.160
And Damon from Dell obliged.

33:15.160 --> 33:18.080
The big difference is the focus on the 9300.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.760
So first, it is a completely redesigned machine,

33:20.760 --> 33:23.320
even though they look very similar side by side.

33:23.320 --> 33:26.320
And again, that is because the design tenets have not

33:26.320 --> 33:27.640
changed radically.

33:27.640 --> 33:30.680
But the materials and the technology that we've got

33:30.680 --> 33:35.120
have let us continue making it smaller, smaller, smaller.

33:35.120 --> 33:37.520
And you can only eke so much out.

33:37.520 --> 33:41.760
But in this one, we do have managed

33:41.760 --> 33:46.680
to get it a little bit smaller and maximize the screen.

33:46.680 --> 33:50.840
So we're maximizing the things that matter, the screen,

33:50.840 --> 33:54.120
the keyboard, the touchpad, right?

33:54.120 --> 33:55.520
So the touchpad is bigger.

33:55.520 --> 33:58.360
The keyboard, if you look at it from the two models,

33:58.360 --> 34:00.920
the keyboard now goes edge to edge.

34:00.920 --> 34:01.840
Yeah.

34:01.840 --> 34:04.560
And of course, the screen is probably

34:04.560 --> 34:07.480
the biggest point of difference between the one we have

34:07.480 --> 34:09.840
in studio and the one announced at CES.

34:09.840 --> 34:16.280
The display, we've gone from a FHD and UHD, which is,

34:16.280 --> 34:21.320
you know, you're 1920 by 1080, and you're 3840 by 2160.

34:21.320 --> 34:28.640
We've moved up to a 10, excuse me, the 16 by 10 aspect ratio

34:28.640 --> 34:30.480
instead of 16 by 9.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.640
So you get that extra vertical space.

34:32.640 --> 34:36.640
And the way we did that is by almost eliminating

34:36.640 --> 34:38.400
the bottom bezel.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.600
There we go.

34:39.600 --> 34:42.320
A little bit larger screen ratio, a little bit nicer

34:42.320 --> 34:45.040
keyboard to body ratio.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.840
And those sound like small changes,

34:46.840 --> 34:50.560
but take credit what he said, to make those kind of changes

34:50.560 --> 34:52.920
on a laptop that's already this small with such a nice screen,

34:52.920 --> 34:53.800
that's a lot of work.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.560
Yeah.

34:55.560 --> 34:57.880
So we had this one in-house since before Christmas,

34:57.880 --> 34:59.640
and Wes and I traded it back and forth.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.440
Wes got to spend quite a bit of time on it,

35:01.440 --> 35:03.280
and then we decided to just put it in studio

35:03.280 --> 35:04.760
and run benchmarks on it.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.520
And I'll tell you, if you're thinking

35:06.520 --> 35:10.360
about a laptop like this, here's a couple of things

35:10.360 --> 35:12.200
that I really like about this.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.240
Number one is it's all USB-C now.

35:15.240 --> 35:18.080
Even the power, we've all gone USB-C.

35:18.080 --> 35:21.160
And because I kind of just over the last couple of years

35:21.160 --> 35:24.440
have been making the transition to getting a dongle for this

35:24.440 --> 35:29.160
or changing from an HDMI cable to a USB-C cable,

35:29.160 --> 35:30.920
just kind of making these changes,

35:30.920 --> 35:33.400
pretty easy to just slot this in now to my existing workflow.

35:33.400 --> 35:35.920
Right, once you've got USB-C docks hanging around, then,

35:35.920 --> 35:37.160
OK, not a big deal.

35:37.160 --> 35:38.920
The keyboard remains pretty good.

35:38.920 --> 35:40.560
It's not my absolute favorite keyboard.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.600
No, I mean, I'm using the ThinkPad most of the time,

35:43.600 --> 35:45.560
so it wasn't quite as nice of that.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.840
But it's so much more portable, it kind of makes up for it.

35:48.840 --> 35:51.400
And unlike our ThinkPads, this has a nice backlight keyboard

35:51.400 --> 35:51.920
too.

35:51.920 --> 35:54.120
Backlight keyboard and that screen.

35:54.120 --> 35:56.360
Yeah, OK, so the screen is really great.

35:56.360 --> 35:58.840
Even on ours, the non-CES edition,

35:58.840 --> 36:00.560
the screen is really great.

36:00.560 --> 36:02.000
And so this is what I wanted to say,

36:02.000 --> 36:05.600
is I think this laptop now that they have released the CES

36:05.600 --> 36:10.520
edition is sitting in a very sweet spot for those of you who

36:10.520 --> 36:14.320
are OK having something that's just about as good as the latest

36:14.320 --> 36:15.680
and greatest edition.

36:15.680 --> 36:20.920
And if your workload is disk, IOT heavy, or CPU heavy,

36:20.920 --> 36:23.200
or those two things together, you

36:23.200 --> 36:25.520
would be very impressed with what this laptop can do.

36:25.520 --> 36:27.240
Again, we'll have comparison benchmarks

36:27.240 --> 36:28.320
linked in the show notes.

36:28.320 --> 36:32.240
You can run the exact same benchmark on your hardware

36:32.240 --> 36:34.640
and see how it compares to this laptop.

36:34.640 --> 36:38.680
But in short, this thing was benchmarking

36:38.680 --> 36:43.600
at ranges of high-end Ryzen desktops with high-speed disks.

36:43.600 --> 36:47.480
Like, it's really crunching numbers in the CPU

36:47.480 --> 36:50.320
as fast as possible, really lighting up the cores,

36:50.320 --> 36:52.920
and it can suck data on and off of that disk.

36:52.920 --> 36:55.520
Yeah, we did some tests doing a whole bunch of video encoding,

36:55.520 --> 36:57.400
and it performed very admirably.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.200
Sure, the fan does kick on, but it

36:59.200 --> 37:02.480
doesn't get crazy hot because it actually has very good thermals.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.820
So I couldn't tell you, well, it needs more performance.

37:04.820 --> 37:07.040
I couldn't say to you the screen isn't good enough.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.240
The trackpad, I think, is the best trackpad

37:09.240 --> 37:12.480
you can get on a computer pre-built with Linux.

37:12.480 --> 37:17.640
The build is, it's like all the previous XPSs, it's very good.

37:17.640 --> 37:19.820
The question is, can you actually buy it now

37:19.820 --> 37:21.360
that the new version has been released?

37:21.360 --> 37:24.000
And could you maybe get it at a slight discount?

37:24.000 --> 37:26.440
Maybe you want to do a little budget shopping.

37:26.440 --> 37:28.400
Well, I asked, Damon, just that.

37:28.400 --> 37:33.120
So I'm glad you asked that because, interestingly enough,

37:33.120 --> 37:35.800
a lot of times you'll see manufacturers

37:35.800 --> 37:39.600
they'll discontinue a model after they bring in the new one.

37:39.600 --> 37:42.520
And they're going to actually let the older generation

37:42.520 --> 37:45.920
model live on for a while next to this one.

37:45.920 --> 37:47.880
I think it's an experiment to see

37:47.880 --> 37:51.840
how folks feel about the changes that we made and whatnot.

37:51.840 --> 37:54.800
But so you'll be able to go to Dell.com

37:54.800 --> 37:56.960
and you'll be able to click on XPS 13,

37:56.960 --> 38:00.440
and it'll give you an option, XPS 13, 7390,

38:00.440 --> 38:03.880
or it'll say new XPS 13, and that will be the 9300.

38:03.880 --> 38:06.600
So they will live on side by side.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.600
Right now, I think both of them are starting at 999,

38:09.600 --> 38:12.720
but things do go on sale from time to time.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.600
That, I think, is the hint there.

38:14.600 --> 38:17.640
And depending on how you price them, the prices will change.

38:17.640 --> 38:20.280
But I think if you watch for a sale,

38:20.280 --> 38:23.640
the version we have here in studio, the 7300 version,

38:23.640 --> 38:26.240
will be very competitively priced soon.

38:26.240 --> 38:29.200
Last time I looked, there was $100 off going on right now

38:29.200 --> 38:30.120
over at Dell.com.

38:30.120 --> 38:31.040
Oh, really, already?

38:31.040 --> 38:34.040
The mileage may vary, but yeah, it's definitely worth looking at.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.240
Yeah, because I could see them keeping this around

38:36.240 --> 38:38.240
and doing special discounts, Black Friday sales,

38:38.240 --> 38:39.560
all those kinds of things.

38:39.560 --> 38:40.920
Because there's just a scale of economies

38:40.920 --> 38:42.240
just since they've been building this for so long,

38:42.240 --> 38:43.840
and they have the newer version now.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.800
And there's really nothing I could ask.

38:45.800 --> 38:47.440
Would I like a slightly wider screen?

38:47.440 --> 38:48.160
Sure.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.800
The other thing that's pretty great

38:49.800 --> 38:51.800
is the new edition has been changed to 1610.

38:51.800 --> 38:54.040
This is a 16 by 9 ratio.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.480
But again, I don't know if it's really necessary.

38:56.480 --> 38:58.440
So I thought, well, where is this going?

38:58.440 --> 38:59.880
Because in talking with them, it's

38:59.880 --> 39:02.720
clear that Dell is feeling pretty

39:02.720 --> 39:05.560
good about the success of the Sputnik program.

39:05.560 --> 39:08.120
It started as this crazy idea of,

39:08.120 --> 39:11.680
let's just ask them what they want from a computer,

39:11.680 --> 39:15.320
and then let's take our best rig that we sell

39:15.320 --> 39:17.880
and give them that, which was a weird concept.

39:17.880 --> 39:18.360
Right.

39:18.360 --> 39:21.240
They didn't start with a netbook line, something cheap and easy.

39:21.240 --> 39:22.640
Which is what everybody else was doing.

39:22.640 --> 39:23.960
They had actually taken a crack, I

39:23.960 --> 39:25.960
don't if you remember, at a really cheap laptop.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.400
Oh, right, right.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.800
That was from a different area of the company.

39:29.800 --> 39:34.720
And this was a risk because it involved

39:34.720 --> 39:38.800
spending a lot of time ahead upstreaming drivers.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.280
Before they even shipped a product,

39:40.280 --> 39:42.880
they had to pay developers to start upstreaming, right?

39:42.880 --> 39:45.520
And work with their partners to do licensing.

39:45.520 --> 39:47.040
Wait, how do we Linux again?

39:47.040 --> 39:48.320
Yeah.

39:48.320 --> 39:51.040
So it was considered sort of Barton going out

39:51.040 --> 39:53.800
on the edge with this idea.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.880
And using a fund that had been established

39:55.880 --> 40:00.120
in the company for crazy ideas to just seed this thing.

40:00.120 --> 40:02.200
Now you fast forward, and it appears

40:02.200 --> 40:05.440
this has been looked at as one of the more innovative successes

40:05.440 --> 40:07.320
inside the company in a while.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.480
That's where we're at now.

40:09.480 --> 40:11.760
We could be seeing big things coming from this.

40:11.760 --> 40:12.240
And right.

40:12.240 --> 40:14.240
I mean, with a big corporation like that,

40:14.240 --> 40:15.680
if it's not going to perform well for the company,

40:15.680 --> 40:16.800
at some point they're going to exit.

40:16.800 --> 40:18.560
And it's been going on for a long time.

40:18.560 --> 40:20.880
And I think we as a community need to recognize

40:20.880 --> 40:23.680
not only the importance of that, but how great it

40:23.680 --> 40:26.040
is that we have a really rich hardware

40:26.040 --> 40:29.120
ecosystem where each of them have their advantages.

40:29.120 --> 40:31.480
There's clear advantages from each vendor right now.

40:31.480 --> 40:34.240
And so you have to wonder, where are things going in the future?

40:34.240 --> 40:37.000
Who's going to take the risk on the next big thing?

40:37.000 --> 40:40.360
Like an ARM laptop, or maybe an all Ryzen system.

40:40.360 --> 40:42.280
I know a lot of people listening are asking,

40:42.280 --> 40:44.560
did he ask them if they're going to do Ryzen?

40:44.560 --> 40:45.640
Well, I did.

40:45.640 --> 40:48.920
And it sounds like maybe it's not outside the realm

40:48.920 --> 40:49.920
of possibility.

40:49.920 --> 40:53.200
You know, I think if you just look at the product lines,

40:53.200 --> 40:57.720
Dell already carries AMD product lines, AMD components

40:57.720 --> 40:59.400
in our product lines.

40:59.400 --> 41:02.960
There's no reason why in the future, if that makes sense

41:02.960 --> 41:05.000
and we hear that feedback from our customers,

41:05.000 --> 41:08.560
why we couldn't incorporate something like that,

41:08.560 --> 41:11.520
if it makes sense in the bigger picture, right?

41:11.520 --> 41:15.480
ARM, I'm not really the right person to comment on that.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.480
You know, I can tell you that we are always

41:17.480 --> 41:20.080
looking at the technologies that are out there,

41:20.080 --> 41:22.840
because we don't ever want to look out there and just say,

41:22.840 --> 41:26.560
oh, well, this is off the table, because we just, you know,

41:26.560 --> 41:28.840
we're always looking at the technologies,

41:28.840 --> 41:31.280
seeing where they're going, where the pros, where

41:31.280 --> 41:33.160
the cons, strengths, weaknesses.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.400
And does it make sense for our customers?

41:35.400 --> 41:37.360
Is it a good strategic move?

41:37.360 --> 41:40.480
So sounds like if enough people ask over time,

41:40.480 --> 41:43.080
they could go that direction.

41:43.080 --> 41:47.040
And that'd be pretty neat to see something like that XPS 13,

41:47.040 --> 41:49.200
but all Ryzen would really be cool.

41:49.200 --> 41:50.580
I would love to play with that.

41:50.580 --> 41:52.120
And Ryzen's getting more and more

41:52.120 --> 41:54.160
applicable for something that size.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.840
So Wes, I want to give you a chance

41:55.840 --> 41:57.040
to talk about it a little bit, since you

41:57.040 --> 41:59.400
spent a considerable amount of time with the laptop.

41:59.400 --> 42:02.160
Yeah, I pretty much use it as my day-to-day work machine

42:02.160 --> 42:04.400
for at least a week, I would say.

42:04.400 --> 42:08.680
Yeah, and then plus, all of the horrible torturing.

42:08.680 --> 42:10.480
I just basically say to Wes, like,

42:10.480 --> 42:11.760
let's run these benchmarks.

42:11.760 --> 42:14.760
And then Wes really has to do all of the setting it up.

42:14.760 --> 42:15.880
And I was impressed.

42:15.880 --> 42:17.200
I mean, we had like net data going.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.120
I actually set up a little, had data

42:19.120 --> 42:21.000
going into a Prometheus cluster so we could watch

42:21.000 --> 42:22.200
as it was encoding.

42:22.200 --> 42:22.960
It's pretty geeky.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.000
It was pretty geeky.

42:24.000 --> 42:24.400
Yeah.

42:24.400 --> 42:24.880
I was impressed.

42:24.880 --> 42:26.200
Now, there's a couple of things.

42:26.200 --> 42:31.240
Dell still hasn't fixed the EFI on their XPS line.

42:31.240 --> 42:33.120
It's not like it's terribly broken.

42:33.120 --> 42:35.640
Yeah, but if you want to do fancy stuff like that,

42:35.640 --> 42:38.000
you can boot the kernel with what's known as EFI stub,

42:38.000 --> 42:41.600
where due to some clever hackery on the kernel's part,

42:41.600 --> 42:44.340
you can make the kernel act like an EFI executable.

42:44.340 --> 42:47.400
So you can just boot the kernel, no boot load or nothing.

42:47.400 --> 42:49.680
But you obviously have to give it some commands, right?

42:49.680 --> 42:52.280
What, you know, where the inner RAMFS is, and the root,

42:52.280 --> 42:53.800
and all that.

42:53.800 --> 42:55.800
EFI supports all of this.

42:55.800 --> 42:59.280
Unfortunately, Dell's EFI does not pass those variables.

42:59.280 --> 43:01.600
The upside is I discovered a neat little project, which

43:01.600 --> 43:02.280
is alternative.

43:02.280 --> 43:03.940
Maybe you don't want grub, and you don't even

43:03.940 --> 43:04.920
want system deep boot.

43:04.920 --> 43:05.420
I don't.

43:05.420 --> 43:05.920
Nope.

43:05.920 --> 43:06.560
Super minimal.

43:06.560 --> 43:07.880
It's just a little C program.

43:07.880 --> 43:10.960
All you need is like the GNU EFI development libraries,

43:10.960 --> 43:14.040
and you just build yourself a custom bootloader

43:14.040 --> 43:15.080
to just boot your kernel.

43:15.080 --> 43:15.880
Nothing else.

43:15.880 --> 43:17.360
That's all it does.

43:17.360 --> 43:18.240
That's pretty slick.

43:18.240 --> 43:18.400
Yeah.

43:18.400 --> 43:21.200
So if you're interested in that kind of booting hackery,

43:21.200 --> 43:22.280
we'll have links to that.

43:22.280 --> 43:23.680
I actually kind of appreciate you mentioning

43:23.680 --> 43:25.340
that kind of feature, specifically

43:25.340 --> 43:28.400
for this class of workstation.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.800
It's meant for developers that are building things.

43:30.800 --> 43:33.500
You might need to boot into another OS.

43:33.500 --> 43:36.400
I mean, ideally, I should think, I should think,

43:36.400 --> 43:39.400
Dell would love the idea that mainstream, open source,

43:39.400 --> 43:43.040
and free software developers, large, maybe Linus or Greg Kh,

43:43.040 --> 43:45.520
would be using one of their devices.

43:45.520 --> 43:48.600
But supporting things like that are kind of necessary.

43:48.600 --> 43:50.440
It's the kind of details that that market is

43:50.440 --> 43:52.080
going to find in your product.

43:52.080 --> 43:53.840
But again, if this is what we're getting down

43:53.840 --> 43:55.760
to in terms of our criticism, it's

43:55.760 --> 43:57.520
also a measure of how good they're doing.

43:57.520 --> 43:57.720
Right.

43:57.720 --> 43:59.480
So the flip side is once I got that working,

43:59.480 --> 44:00.960
boy, this thing boots fast, too.

44:00.960 --> 44:02.520
It's just performing all around.

44:02.520 --> 44:03.240
Yeah.

44:03.240 --> 44:06.360
I can't stress how fast that thing can get bits off the disk

44:06.360 --> 44:07.600
and shove it into the CPU.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.060
It's so glorious.

44:09.060 --> 44:09.920
It's amazing.

44:09.920 --> 44:13.080
Now, the other issue I ran into, I mean, out of the box,

44:13.080 --> 44:14.000
it was working great.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
But as we mentioned, even if this isn't the newest laptop,

44:17.000 --> 44:18.200
it's still pretty darn new.

44:18.200 --> 44:21.600
And it's actually got a Wi-Fi 6 chipset inside of it.

44:21.600 --> 44:22.600
Yeah, tell me about that.

44:22.600 --> 44:24.200
Now, it has already been upstreamed.

44:24.200 --> 44:26.660
But if you're not running one of those distributions that

44:26.660 --> 44:28.520
gives you a nice, new, modern kernel,

44:28.520 --> 44:29.980
you're going to run into some problems

44:29.980 --> 44:32.200
and probably won't have Wi-Fi out of the box,

44:32.200 --> 44:34.520
like if you install, say, like an older elementary OS.

44:34.520 --> 44:35.560
How was it under Arch?

44:35.560 --> 44:36.880
Oh, yeah, Arch worked just fine.

44:36.880 --> 44:39.400
And did you have to do anything with 2004?

44:39.400 --> 44:40.920
2004 worked right out of the box.

44:40.920 --> 44:42.980
And thankfully, it is Intel Wi-Fi.

44:42.980 --> 44:45.040
So there's actually just driver firmware

44:45.040 --> 44:46.880
you can go download and add to your system,

44:46.880 --> 44:48.720
even if you don't have the newest kernel.

44:48.720 --> 44:50.280
And if I'm not thinking through this,

44:50.280 --> 44:54.400
when we did the 2004 install, we opted to use ZFS.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.720
So we're talking about how fast this thing is

44:56.720 --> 44:58.520
with using ZFS on it, too.

44:58.520 --> 45:01.080
Just as a note, it doesn't seem to have impacted our perception

45:01.080 --> 45:01.880
of the performance.

45:01.880 --> 45:03.600
No, not at all.

45:03.600 --> 45:04.860
Or really, the benchmarks.

45:04.860 --> 45:07.320
I mean, we did those benchmarks all using ZFS

45:07.320 --> 45:08.840
for this last round.

45:08.840 --> 45:09.640
It screamed.

45:09.640 --> 45:13.080
Pleased to report, too, that in our early 2004 testing,

45:13.080 --> 45:14.720
ZFS option is still performing great.

45:14.720 --> 45:17.560
Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.

45:17.560 --> 45:20.840
My only kind of criticisms that I really have for this thing

45:20.840 --> 45:24.360
is the fan noise is a little significant.

45:24.360 --> 45:26.000
Once it's up, if it's really doing work,

45:26.000 --> 45:27.000
you're going to hear it.

45:27.000 --> 45:29.280
And the kind of workloads that I would throw at it

45:29.280 --> 45:32.800
would push the noise levels that I am comfortable with,

45:32.800 --> 45:34.900
because I work on mic a lot.

45:34.900 --> 45:36.860
And so it is an issue in that regard.

45:36.860 --> 45:38.880
And so if you're sensitive to noise,

45:38.880 --> 45:41.720
it's not a white noise.

45:41.720 --> 45:44.480
It's a little bit of a harsher kind of a pink noise.

45:44.480 --> 45:46.920
You can definitely tell those fans are getting aggressive.

45:46.920 --> 45:49.320
But you trade for that.

45:49.320 --> 45:51.040
You get something that's so thin,

45:51.040 --> 45:52.680
you don't even notice it in your bag.

45:52.680 --> 45:55.080
What was so great about it is both Wes and I

45:55.080 --> 45:58.200
could just slip this in our bag that's already full of stuff,

45:58.200 --> 45:59.680
and it was no big deal.

45:59.680 --> 46:00.760
It would also be perfect.

46:00.760 --> 46:02.640
Maybe you have an existing work laptop,

46:02.640 --> 46:05.240
and you also want to bring your personal to keep that separate.

46:05.240 --> 46:05.800
Beautiful.

46:05.800 --> 46:06.760
And I think if you remember, they're

46:06.760 --> 46:09.240
targeting the developer where that workload is often

46:09.240 --> 46:11.040
it's bursty in terms of CPU.

46:11.040 --> 46:12.160
Maybe you're building.

46:12.160 --> 46:15.660
But otherwise, it's terminal, or it's your IDE in a browser.

46:15.660 --> 46:19.360
And in those conditions, so one of my famous

46:19.360 --> 46:21.440
just sort of sit-in-there working mode that I did

46:21.440 --> 46:23.440
is YouTube video.

46:23.440 --> 46:25.480
Then I pop that out into picture-in-picture.

46:25.480 --> 46:26.480
Then I use the browser.

46:26.480 --> 46:27.400
I'm using the terminal.

46:27.400 --> 46:29.980
I'm doing stuff, but nothing massive chatting,

46:29.980 --> 46:31.840
looking things up, putting together a doc.

46:31.840 --> 46:33.920
Active multitasking, trying to get stuff done.

46:33.920 --> 46:36.000
In that scenario, you don't even have to hear it.

46:36.000 --> 46:36.600
I mean, it's not.

46:36.600 --> 46:37.880
I mean, we're talking like when you're really

46:37.880 --> 46:39.040
pushing with that multi-focusing.

46:39.040 --> 46:40.560
That, I think, is the thing to know

46:40.560 --> 46:43.680
is that the curve settings, it's quiet almost all the time,

46:43.680 --> 46:45.680
and then it gets really loud.

46:45.680 --> 46:47.840
And as you would expect, but it's just

46:47.840 --> 46:50.560
one of those things that I'll also mention is in that,

46:50.560 --> 46:54.480
I saw battery life ranges from five hours,

46:54.480 --> 46:57.160
if you're not pushing it very hard, to three hours,

46:57.160 --> 46:58.520
if you're pushing it pretty hard.

46:58.520 --> 47:00.720
And remember that thing's got a very bright screen, too,

47:00.720 --> 47:02.000
so you can back that down a little bit.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.720
And that'll also vary your mileage.

47:03.720 --> 47:05.000
I think if you do some tuning, you'll

47:05.000 --> 47:06.800
probably see seven or eight hours

47:06.800 --> 47:09.040
if you're not doing too much with it, but you're right.

47:09.040 --> 47:10.960
There are some trade-offs for the portability.

47:10.960 --> 47:14.200
We both really like holding it, too, which is a weird thing.

47:14.200 --> 47:16.560
But we both, I think, really enjoy the feel in the hand.

47:16.560 --> 47:18.160
Where they've put the bumps on the bottom,

47:18.160 --> 47:20.440
it makes it easier to hold on to so it doesn't slip out.

47:20.440 --> 47:22.000
It's got some traction.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.040
It's just a pleasant machine to interface with.

47:24.040 --> 47:24.540
Yeah.

47:24.540 --> 47:30.680
If you are in this area of considering a MacBook Air class

47:30.680 --> 47:35.280
machine or a MacBook 13, that range of device,

47:35.280 --> 47:38.080
or a really nice high-end thin ThinkPad,

47:38.080 --> 47:39.920
I would definitely add the XPS to your line,

47:39.920 --> 47:42.440
if that's your category.

47:42.440 --> 47:46.600
The thing about this XPS 13 is it packs more of a punch

47:46.600 --> 47:48.760
than you expect in that small packaging.

47:48.760 --> 47:51.160
Yeah, I think the only complaint I still have,

47:51.160 --> 47:54.760
including with the new model, is that 16 gigs of RAM.

47:54.760 --> 47:55.920
Yeah.

47:55.920 --> 47:56.920
Yeah, it needs more RAM.

47:56.920 --> 47:57.920
It needs a lot more RAM.

47:57.920 --> 48:00.680
But they're using a very special low-power everything

48:00.680 --> 48:03.080
in that thing, so I can understand that.

48:03.080 --> 48:04.640
But it's pretty great.

48:04.640 --> 48:07.040
We didn't play around much with the battery testing,

48:07.040 --> 48:08.440
so there's probably others that will give you

48:08.440 --> 48:09.400
more details on that.

48:09.400 --> 48:11.160
Because we use it first.

48:11.160 --> 48:15.360
A lot of times, our processes use it as a work machine,

48:15.360 --> 48:18.160
run it through all of its paces as much as possible.

48:18.160 --> 48:21.120
And then something we try to do in all of our reviews

48:21.120 --> 48:23.520
is post at least one comparable benchmark

48:23.520 --> 48:26.480
so you can see where it would fall in your range,

48:26.480 --> 48:28.080
see if it's worth the money for you.

48:28.080 --> 48:30.200
And then the other thing we try to do, if we have time,

48:30.200 --> 48:32.440
and thankfully, Dell was very generous with our time

48:32.440 --> 48:35.520
on this one, is we try to throw a couple of different distros

48:35.520 --> 48:36.000
on there.

48:36.000 --> 48:37.720
Because I like to do that.

48:37.720 --> 48:39.120
If I buy a piece of hardware, I want

48:39.120 --> 48:42.280
to know that I can run more than just what ships on there.

48:42.280 --> 48:43.720
I think that's what's so funny about this.

48:43.720 --> 48:44.840
We're really celebrating the fact

48:44.840 --> 48:46.280
that you can just buy this Linux laptop

48:46.280 --> 48:49.120
and it comes with Linux, but all of us want to go customize it.

48:49.120 --> 48:50.400
Isn't that the thing, though?

48:50.400 --> 48:51.760
For one, I like to explore.

48:51.760 --> 48:53.440
Two, I want to vote with my wallet,

48:53.440 --> 48:55.440
and I want to show that I'm buying a Linux machine.

48:55.440 --> 48:56.240
Absolutely.

48:56.240 --> 48:59.920
And to me, if it's running a mainstream distro, what it says

48:59.920 --> 49:02.400
is it runs a mainstream kernel, likely.

49:02.400 --> 49:05.900
And so even if, when it's brand, brand, brand new,

49:05.900 --> 49:08.280
it's got some patches, the great thing about these Dells

49:08.280 --> 49:10.280
is they're upstream in that stuff.

49:10.280 --> 49:11.960
So you give it a little bit of time,

49:11.960 --> 49:13.640
and it's just in the mainline kernel.

49:13.640 --> 49:14.280
I love that.

49:14.280 --> 49:15.480
And it's pretty nice.

49:15.480 --> 49:18.260
So it's a pretty good machine if you're in the market.

49:18.260 --> 49:21.560
And we should put some links to it in the show notes.

49:21.560 --> 49:22.520
That would be good.

49:22.520 --> 49:24.080
And thanks to Damon for stopping, well,

49:24.080 --> 49:25.440
for letting us call him up and ask questions.

49:25.440 --> 49:27.280
I was going to say stop and buy, but you could probably

49:27.280 --> 49:28.400
tell we called him on the phone.

49:28.400 --> 49:29.700
We do that every now and then.

49:29.700 --> 49:31.880
We call them so you don't have to, right?

49:31.880 --> 49:32.720
That's right.

49:32.720 --> 49:34.500
Yeah, before we get out of here, we

49:34.500 --> 49:36.280
have another unplugged to record,

49:36.280 --> 49:40.320
but this is nearly the end for the download audience.

49:40.320 --> 49:42.120
We have a pick, and this one's pretty cool.

49:42.120 --> 49:43.320
It's called Glow.

49:43.320 --> 49:45.120
And I actually don't remember which one of us

49:45.120 --> 49:46.760
found Glow, because I don't think it was me.

49:46.760 --> 49:49.100
I was going to say it was you, but maybe it was Cheesy.

49:49.100 --> 49:50.560
Cheesy, did you find Glow?

49:50.560 --> 49:51.520
Maybe.

49:51.520 --> 49:52.520
I don't remember.

49:52.520 --> 49:53.560
I love it.

49:53.560 --> 49:56.160
The thing is, we've been pick shopping.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.720
We spent the holiday, a lot of us

49:57.720 --> 50:00.280
making lists of our favorite picks and stuff.

50:00.280 --> 50:02.480
And so we've all got ones that were just

50:02.480 --> 50:04.500
thrown in the mix right now.

50:04.500 --> 50:06.680
This is a really nice looking way

50:06.680 --> 50:10.920
to render Markdown on the command line.

50:10.920 --> 50:14.360
It must have been from Cheesy's video.

50:14.360 --> 50:15.840
It's super easy to install.

50:15.840 --> 50:18.600
You just brew, install Glow.

50:18.600 --> 50:20.120
Anybody?

50:20.120 --> 50:22.280
Get out of here, Mac guy.

50:22.280 --> 50:24.240
Actually, no, there's brew for Linux now, too.

50:24.240 --> 50:25.200
It's fine, it's fine.

50:25.200 --> 50:26.160
I know, I know, I know.

50:26.160 --> 50:27.520
But I just tried to trigger you.

50:27.520 --> 50:29.360
I just was seeing if you were listening.

50:29.360 --> 50:33.360
Of course, there's other package managers that have it, too.

50:33.360 --> 50:35.440
Yeah, it looks like there's binaries for Windows, Linux,

50:35.440 --> 50:36.280
and FreeBSD.

50:36.280 --> 50:39.680
Yeah, it's in the AUR, too, by the way, Arch.

50:39.680 --> 50:41.780
Anyways, it's just really nice, because we often

50:41.780 --> 50:47.400
will be talking about these massive electron applications.

50:47.400 --> 50:49.420
Well, instead, you can do it on the command line.

50:49.420 --> 50:51.000
It might all be NPM on the back end,

50:51.000 --> 50:52.580
but at least it's on the command line.

50:52.580 --> 50:54.720
That doesn't matter, right?

50:54.720 --> 50:56.520
Web apps on the command line don't matter.

50:56.520 --> 50:59.680
What you do is you run this in hyperterm or whatever it is,

50:59.680 --> 51:01.960
that Windows terminal that's based on Electron,

51:01.960 --> 51:02.840
and you're really set.

51:02.840 --> 51:05.640
You've got to make sure you keep Electron around.

51:05.640 --> 51:08.200
So we'll have a link to Glow, which does look really nice.

51:08.200 --> 51:10.560
I kid around, but it actually looks really fantastic.

51:10.560 --> 51:15.360
I love that their description is render Markdown on the CLI

51:15.360 --> 51:17.120
with pizzazz.

51:17.120 --> 51:19.360
And pizzazz is an italics.

51:19.360 --> 51:20.960
Which made me think of pizza.

51:20.960 --> 51:22.340
I want a Linux-powered pizza oven.

51:22.340 --> 51:23.320
That's what I want.

51:23.320 --> 51:25.080
I want to do a Linux-unplugged pizza party,

51:25.080 --> 51:26.960
like we did that barbecue.

51:26.960 --> 51:28.720
I also want to do a barbecue, though.

51:28.720 --> 51:30.720
There could be barbecue pizza, my friend.

51:30.720 --> 51:32.200
You're reading my mind, Wes.

51:32.200 --> 51:34.560
You're reading my mind.

51:34.560 --> 51:37.200
All right, we'll go over to linuxunplugged.com

51:37.200 --> 51:39.280
slash 337 for links to everything

51:39.280 --> 51:42.920
we talked about today, as well as linuxunplugged.com

51:42.920 --> 51:45.000
slash contact if you want to correct us,

51:45.000 --> 51:49.280
or more importantly, share a pic or an insight or something

51:49.280 --> 51:50.280
you've been thinking about.

51:50.280 --> 51:51.320
We love hearing from you.

51:51.320 --> 51:53.200
And last but not least, go get more Westpane

51:53.200 --> 51:56.720
over at techsnap.systems and get daily, weekday news,

51:56.720 --> 52:00.680
linuxheadlines.show every weekday in three minutes

52:00.680 --> 52:01.200
or less.

52:01.200 --> 52:04.040
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

52:04.040 --> 52:21.240
I'm going to go ahead and turn this off, and I'll see you

52:21.240 --> 52:23.200
back here next Tuesday.

52:23.200 --> 52:23.700
Bye.

52:23.700 --> 52:24.200
Bye.

52:24.200 --> 52:24.700
Bye.

52:24.700 --> 52:25.200
Bye.

52:25.200 --> 52:25.700
Bye.

52:25.700 --> 52:26.200
Bye.

52:26.200 --> 52:26.700
Bye.

52:26.700 --> 52:27.200
Bye.

52:27.200 --> 52:27.700
Bye.

52:27.700 --> 52:28.200
Bye.

52:28.200 --> 52:28.700
Bye.

52:28.700 --> 52:29.200
Bye.

52:29.200 --> 52:29.700
Bye.

52:29.700 --> 52:30.200
Bye.

52:30.200 --> 52:30.700
Bye.

52:30.700 --> 52:31.200
Bye.

52:31.200 --> 52:31.700
Bye.

52:31.700 --> 52:32.200
Bye.

52:32.200 --> 52:32.700
Bye.

52:32.700 --> 52:33.200
Bye.

53:00.180 --> 53:01.680
Bye

53:01.680 --> 53:05.420
episode just want to make it clear that's not what I'm saying what you're

53:05.420 --> 53:11.300
saying don't all right let's go pick a title over there JB titles calm it makes

53:11.300 --> 53:14.940
me think you know in the US we've got this whole impeachment thing but it's

53:14.940 --> 53:17.580
always very popular to go find the clips of the politician from like ten years

53:17.580 --> 53:21.180
ago saying the opposite makes me think we could find some last clips of you

53:21.180 --> 53:24.580
that might be pretty and oh no kidding that's where some of this comes from is

53:24.580 --> 53:31.380
reflection on I was one of the loudest mouthpieces for advocating everyone use

53:31.380 --> 53:37.700
Linux and I mean you remember the switch competition I that not only was that

53:37.700 --> 53:44.420
manifested in the podcast but it came out in my career I made a consulting

53:44.420 --> 53:47.460
career out of going in and converting people's Windows installs to Linux in

53:47.460 --> 53:53.180
the last part of my IT career and sometimes looking back at it I think in

53:53.180 --> 53:57.380
most cases for file and print and basics I was always right but I'd never even

53:57.380 --> 54:01.220
really considered Windows right the stop and think of like this is really what I

54:01.220 --> 54:06.740
should be doing and then if I had to use Windows it'd be in a VM and now I've

54:06.740 --> 54:15.340
gone from a like die-hard what would you call that evangelists to I don't know if

54:15.340 --> 54:20.060
advocates the right word but now I'm much more of this is a tool that works

54:20.060 --> 54:26.780
really well for me and I think works really well for a lot of uses but if

54:26.780 --> 54:29.580
there's a tool that works really well for you that's fine it seems like it's

54:29.580 --> 54:31.980
kind of the stage of any sort of relationship right you fell in love with

54:31.980 --> 54:36.220
Linux at first it rescued you from the depths of Windows so it's natural to be

54:36.220 --> 54:39.500
infatuated with it yes but now it's just it's another tool in your tool belt and

54:39.500 --> 54:42.620
you can think about a little more critically yeah initially it was solving

54:42.620 --> 54:48.240
really significant problems for me and it was doing it for free and I was

54:48.240 --> 54:53.980
blown away it was just yeah I can this is something I can even do and now it's

54:53.980 --> 54:59.180
transitioned to well I can understand why using Photoshop is important for you

54:59.180 --> 55:03.780
or I can appreciate that you like the Mac better that's fine I think this is

55:03.780 --> 55:07.820
great you know I really and I think part of it too has been my distro hopping and

55:07.820 --> 55:11.140
my desktop environment hopping when I get really into something for a bit and

55:11.140 --> 55:15.140
then I moved something else Michael this is great and then I realized it's all

55:15.140 --> 55:19.100
kind of great and whatever I want to use is fine right it doesn't have to be the

55:19.100 --> 55:22.580
only solution for everybody it's that there's a lot of good options yeah and I

55:22.580 --> 55:28.900
think the other aspect to it that we sort of fail to appreciate in 2020 is

55:28.900 --> 55:37.260
it doesn't really need the same kind of evangelizing we won in terms of market

55:37.260 --> 55:41.540
penetration and server and mobile and as a default way for most software

55:41.540 --> 55:46.220
development that happens at scale like that's just now a given that wasn't a

55:46.220 --> 55:50.700
given in the late 90s in the early 2000s right especially after Microsoft

55:50.700 --> 55:55.820
survived the antitrust trial it was like oh crap they're still here yeah I mean

55:55.820 --> 56:01.140
it was that's where I think a lot of the anger towards Microsoft came from is it

56:01.140 --> 56:06.500
was a competition for how software was going to be developed for the next

56:06.500 --> 56:12.180
decade and beyond 20 years now right 20 years right this is when we were dealing

56:12.180 --> 56:16.860
with y2k I mean put this in context this is when we were this was the time and in

56:16.860 --> 56:21.380
that time things were not so great there was no Linux in everyone's pocket there

56:21.380 --> 56:25.540
was no every router running Linux there was no cloud there was other people's

56:25.540 --> 56:29.740
computers and they ran everything from Unix to NT to Linux and we'd had the

56:29.740 --> 56:36.020
whole Unix Wars era and Windows and go whoof there was a lot that just was

56:36.020 --> 56:42.780
uncertain and so it felt it felt necessary to evangelize Linux in a very

56:42.780 --> 56:47.100
direct way now here we are where most people's

56:47.100 --> 56:50.220
information's in a cloud provider that they're getting access to through a web

56:50.220 --> 56:56.300
browser we have electron we have snaps and flat packs you have just about every

56:56.300 --> 57:00.300
vendor doing their best to appeal to every type of user with Microsoft with

57:00.300 --> 57:04.220
the subsystem and with Apple's new Pro hardware and with the various different

57:04.220 --> 57:07.340
Linux distribution attempts and Dell Sputnik program it's like there's so

57:07.340 --> 57:11.700
many options that all can do the job now so it's kind of like whatever works for

57:11.700 --> 57:16.620
you I can't really pass judgment on anymore I just who the hell am I I just

57:16.620 --> 57:22.220
know what works for me I know it works for our group and beyond that I'm good

57:22.220 --> 57:26.780
have at it whatever you want to use and so I think that's where I look at this

57:26.780 --> 57:33.140
and go don't make my tool that I use for my job less powerful don't take pseudo

57:33.140 --> 57:37.740
away I mean imagine even you laugh but they're talking about no home partitions

57:37.740 --> 57:40.860
like that's better no no drive encryption that's better like yeah for

57:40.860 --> 57:44.620
average users but that user doesn't actually exist where this user base is

57:44.620 --> 57:48.820
here and expanding at a very rapid clip right and it'd be interesting to have

57:48.820 --> 57:53.580
some more examples because I think home partitions are a good solution to or are

57:53.580 --> 57:56.940
a solution to a lot of things but probably at least a subset of those

57:56.940 --> 58:00.980
solutions could be better handled or more approachably scalably handled in

58:00.980 --> 58:04.540
other ways right so with it's a technology problem not a human problem

58:04.540 --> 58:08.180
the software could be managing the encryption and managing the partitioning

58:08.180 --> 58:11.940
and the user could be blissfully unaware of it or you know maybe in modern

58:11.940 --> 58:15.420
parlance they should be sub volumes or what whatever right but I think this

58:15.420 --> 58:18.580
encryption is exactly is that example right because I five years ago you had

58:18.580 --> 58:21.660
to go learn a whole bunch about Lux and do it do it all yourself and customize

58:21.660 --> 58:25.100
it to get to get it at all and these days it's just a checkbox when you

58:25.100 --> 58:42.620
install Fedora
