00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
This here episode of Linux Unplugged is brought to you by Chris and Wes.

00:04.880 --> 00:08.480
These fine gentlemen have ganged together and bought me

00:08.480 --> 00:10.880
the laptop that we'll be talking about in this episode.

00:10.880 --> 00:11.920
So, gentlemen, thank you.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.640
You're the kindest, sweetest people I know.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.440
You're very welcome.

00:15.440 --> 00:31.440
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.240
My name is Chris.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.120
My name is Wes.

00:33.120 --> 00:34.160
And my name is Brent.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.200
Hello, gentlemen.

00:35.200 --> 00:40.320
Well, coming up on this here show, yep, we finally gave Brent his Dev1 laptop.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.800
We'll tell you the horrible things Wes and I attempted to do before we gave it to him.

00:44.800 --> 00:45.360
Who us?

00:45.360 --> 00:48.560
Then we'll get Brent's first hands-on review, his impressions,

00:48.560 --> 00:52.240
and then my long-term observations because I've had the Dev1

00:52.240 --> 00:54.880
as long as you can possibly have it.

00:54.880 --> 00:59.200
Plus, we've also got the boost, the pics, and a lot more.

00:59.200 --> 01:01.920
So before I go any further, let's bring in that virtual lug.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.760
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:03.760 --> 01:04.560
Hello, Chris.

01:04.560 --> 01:05.280
Hello, Wes.

01:05.280 --> 01:06.080
And hello, Brent.

01:06.080 --> 01:06.720
Hello.

01:06.720 --> 01:07.120
Hello.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.120
You know, the stamina that this Mumble Room represents right now.

01:11.120 --> 01:11.760
Yeah.

01:11.760 --> 01:16.720
We are three hours and 36 minutes into live streaming right now as we record

01:16.720 --> 01:19.120
because we're doing a double on this Sunday.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.360
We're on the road to JPL.

01:21.360 --> 01:21.760
On the road again.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.440
Very excited.

01:23.440 --> 01:26.480
I have been reading JPL books.

01:26.480 --> 01:26.720
I've been-

01:26.720 --> 01:27.440
You're nerding out.

01:27.440 --> 01:27.680
I like that.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.760
Watching JPL documentaries.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.040
I've learned a lot.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.080
There's a lot to learn.

01:32.080 --> 01:34.160
That new tattoo I'm not sure about.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.080
Yeah, it really itches.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.200
And it's been weeks.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.560
It's that weird location you chose.

01:38.560 --> 01:40.560
They said it was normal.

01:40.560 --> 01:41.840
It was their specialty.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.840
I did find them on Craigslist though.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.080
So I'm not so sure about that.

01:46.080 --> 01:46.800
But we're so excited.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.440
By the time you're listening to this, we're going to be well into California.

01:50.480 --> 01:54.480
And Wes will be preparing to join us for the next live episode, which will be

01:54.480 --> 01:55.520
recorded from the road.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.080
Oh, I'm very excited about all of that.

01:58.080 --> 02:01.200
So before we start the show, before we get into the new gear, let's say good

02:01.200 --> 02:02.560
morning to TailScale.

02:02.560 --> 02:03.520
Hello, TailScale.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.520
Go try it for free up to 20 devices.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.800
TailScale.com.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.280
It's a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.000
We love it.

02:10.000 --> 02:10.960
It's going to change your game.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.600
All three of us are users, right?

02:13.600 --> 02:14.560
Sure are.

02:14.560 --> 02:15.060
Yeah, wow.

02:16.160 --> 02:21.200
I think just about everybody at JB is a TailScale user right now because the

02:21.200 --> 02:24.560
last couple of holdouts, I ended up getting converted over because I'm just

02:24.560 --> 02:26.720
sharing things with them through TailScale.

02:26.720 --> 02:27.920
So they had to get it.

02:27.920 --> 02:29.040
And now everybody's fine.

02:29.040 --> 02:29.600
I think so.

02:29.600 --> 02:31.520
I think it's so great.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.040
TailScale.com.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.920
Try it for free up to 20 devices and tell them the unplugged program.

02:35.920 --> 02:42.080
Since it builds a mesh VPN around the WireGuard protocol.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.640
Yeah, if you don't have a mesh VPN, I mean, what are you doing?

02:45.360 --> 02:48.320
I hoard that which your kind covet.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.760
And now it's time for the baller boost.

02:49.760 --> 02:53.360
We don't usually do these at the top of the show, but we had a couple of

02:53.360 --> 02:56.720
special boosts and one of them we want to expand on and just make it a

02:56.720 --> 02:58.400
topic in the episode.

02:58.400 --> 03:03.440
But our first baller boost came in from Nate King, who boosted in the

03:03.440 --> 03:08.160
episode number plus one hundred thousand boosted in four hundred and

03:08.160 --> 03:10.960
seventy seven thousand stats to the show.

03:10.960 --> 03:12.880
And so happy episode for seventy seven.

03:12.880 --> 03:15.840
Have fun at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

03:15.840 --> 03:18.720
You know, Jerry, I'm not going to tell you that these will increase in

03:18.720 --> 03:20.880
value or even hold their current value.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.600
The truth is you bought them because you like them.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.800
They have value to you.

03:24.800 --> 03:25.680
That's what matters.

03:26.960 --> 03:31.840
Now, what happened is Nate King stepped up and I did a challenge to say,

03:31.840 --> 03:34.160
all right, see if somebody can boost in at the current episode number.

03:34.160 --> 03:34.800
And he did it.

03:34.800 --> 03:39.280
And I want to thank him because this does a couple of things.

03:39.280 --> 03:43.680
When these stats come in to the show, we don't just sit on them and do

03:43.680 --> 03:45.040
nothing with them.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.480
We put them to work.

03:46.480 --> 03:50.400
So the way the Lightning Network works is you secure channels between

03:50.400 --> 03:51.840
nodes with stats.

03:52.560 --> 03:56.080
You ensure there is a certain amount of liquidity to transfer value

03:56.080 --> 03:57.440
across that network.

03:57.440 --> 04:02.800
So when these boosts come in, we turn around and we reinvest those

04:02.800 --> 04:07.520
stats into channels that build out the value for value network.

04:07.520 --> 04:11.120
And we're building out channels between the podcast apps, between

04:11.120 --> 04:12.640
Albie, Brent's node.

04:12.640 --> 04:15.680
When Wes finally sets up a node, we'll set up a channel to him.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.560
So we're putting these stats to work.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.280
They're not just sitting in some wallet, not doing anything.

04:21.280 --> 04:23.600
They're actually building out the Lightning Network.

04:23.600 --> 04:27.520
And of course, if at some point, for some reason, we needed those stats,

04:27.520 --> 04:30.320
we could close the channel and get the stats back.

04:31.120 --> 04:34.800
But it gives us the ability to create something that's more robust,

04:34.800 --> 04:38.640
that doesn't require my time to manage and monitor as much.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.000
Listener Caspian, just today, this morning before the show started,

04:43.120 --> 04:47.760
set up a million dollar stat channel between us and him to help route

04:47.760 --> 04:48.720
the boost into the show.

04:48.720 --> 04:49.520
That's incredible.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.320
It really is.

04:50.320 --> 04:53.280
And so, Nate, I'm going to put those stats to work.

04:53.280 --> 04:54.240
So thank you very much.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.880
I really appreciate that.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.560
And we don't just sit there and don't do anything with them.

05:00.560 --> 05:01.920
We make them work.

05:01.920 --> 05:04.160
And so we get value from them today.

05:04.160 --> 05:09.440
And then potentially down the road, one would hope they could be worth a lot more.

05:09.440 --> 05:13.600
And then we could choose to invest them into the network to build out more capacity,

05:13.600 --> 05:17.600
more content, more gear, more experiments, more research, whatever it is.

05:17.600 --> 05:24.880
So your stats are working today, and ideally, they'll be working even harder years down the road.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.520
So a big thank you to Nate for boosting it.

05:27.520 --> 05:32.480
What Nate did is we said, Nate, can you boost in the next episode number and add 100,000 to it?

05:32.480 --> 05:34.560
And while we were live, he did it.

05:34.560 --> 05:35.600
It's absolutely awesome.

05:35.600 --> 05:36.880
It's only like two hours ago, really.

05:37.840 --> 05:38.400
That's amazing.

05:38.400 --> 05:44.160
And to keep that rolling, Jason Y boosted in, our second baller who's kicking off a discussion

05:44.160 --> 05:48.720
this week that I really want to get into with 252,087 sats.

05:52.720 --> 05:58.960
He writes, I hate Android, iOS, iPadOS, et cetera.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.320
OK, I think I get the idea.

06:01.120 --> 06:04.560
He says, I backed the F-Tech Pro 1X.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.240
It was supposed to come with Ubuntu Touch.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.800
Instead, it shipped with Android.

06:08.800 --> 06:09.280
Mom.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.800
Man.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.360
He says, I can install Ubuntu Touch on it.

06:13.360 --> 06:18.400
But Ubuntu Touch just isn't able to connect to Verizon, which is the network he uses.

06:18.400 --> 06:23.680
And additionally, the 4G LTE network doesn't work on Android anymore, as well,

06:23.680 --> 06:25.200
Verizon is shutting it down.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.920
And their regular 4G network is also shutting down soon.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.920
So I soon won't be able to even use Android the way I use it.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.040
What should I do?

06:33.040 --> 06:34.240
Should I switch carriers?

06:34.240 --> 06:35.840
Should I get a separate feature phone?

06:35.840 --> 06:37.760
Should I use the Pro X with a SIM card?

06:38.480 --> 06:39.840
What do I do?

06:39.840 --> 06:43.680
I do I think Canada is keeping their 4G for a while.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.960
So if you don't mind moving, is that for coverage reasons?

06:47.760 --> 06:50.160
Yeah, we do have coverage challenges for sure.

06:50.160 --> 06:50.960
I would imagine.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.640
I think we just gave up.

06:54.240 --> 06:59.200
I think we just gave up 2G at the start of the year, if I remember correctly.

06:59.200 --> 07:02.320
So I think it's a bit of a shame.

07:02.320 --> 07:10.320
I think keeping these lower bandwidth, lower frequency, or low data devices, you know,

07:10.320 --> 07:10.960
things like that.

07:11.760 --> 07:14.240
This is a tricky situation, Jason.

07:14.240 --> 07:19.120
And what's been getting kicked around based on the boost and the emails that we've been

07:19.120 --> 07:23.760
getting from the audience is some of us are thinking about trying out Graphene OS pretty

07:23.760 --> 07:24.480
seriously.

07:24.480 --> 07:27.360
I know, Wes, you're thinking about maybe putting on your Pixel 6.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.560
It'd be fun to try.

07:28.560 --> 07:29.440
It would.

07:29.440 --> 07:34.720
And Graphene OS promises to be a private secure mobile OS that de-Google-ifies Android.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.720
I'm sure probably most of you listening probably know about this.

07:37.520 --> 07:42.160
It's a big task, but it kind of checks all the boxes.

07:42.160 --> 07:46.480
And I've been looking at devices that Graphene OS supports.

07:46.480 --> 07:47.920
It's pretty much the Pixel devices.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.600
But I got the Pixel 3 so I could give it a go in the future.

07:52.240 --> 07:55.840
But I thought for Jason, I wonder if he's considered the KaiOS devices.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.120
Are you guys familiar with this?

07:57.120 --> 07:57.520
No.

07:57.520 --> 08:05.120
KaiOS is a Linux-based OS that's meant for something that lives between a feature phone,

08:05.120 --> 08:08.880
like a flip phone, kind of basic phone, and something that lives between Android.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.840
And I'll put a link in the show notes.

08:12.400 --> 08:17.920
There's a whole range of devices, from BlackBerry-looking devices, flip-looking devices,

08:17.920 --> 08:19.600
to touchscreen devices.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.800
I think I've seen these.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.320
I looked maybe six months ago.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.360
And are these the ones that, well, clearly they are.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.120
They ship with the software on them.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.600
And I think they're available in Europe, if I remember correctly.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.200
I'm not sure if it's North American.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.800
But they look really interesting.

08:32.800 --> 08:37.760
Yeah, the one that seemed the most appealing to me was the Hammer 5 Smart.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.640
So this is essentially a feature phone.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.840
It's got a dial pad, like an actual dial pad.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.280
I'm going to have to relearn T9.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.880
Yep, actual answer and hang up buttons.

08:49.600 --> 08:53.760
And it's IP68 certified, dust and water resistant.

08:53.760 --> 08:57.120
And it's got like this super hardy housing.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.320
It looks super rugged.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.160
I think you can drive over this thing.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.080
Like, it looks like a little tank.

09:02.640 --> 09:05.360
And it runs this Kali OS.

09:05.360 --> 09:11.200
I also have heard of Kali OS, which is a direct graphene alternative.

09:11.200 --> 09:15.040
I'd be interested in hearing from the audience if they've tried it or not.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.480
I've heard good things about it.

09:16.480 --> 09:20.640
I don't think we hear about it quite as often as graphene OS.

09:20.640 --> 09:23.040
But I am very curious about it.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.680
So if anyone's tried it, please write us in.

09:25.680 --> 09:29.920
And then one thing I just wanted to say to Jason kind of sincerely, because I know switching

09:29.920 --> 09:32.400
carriers can be a real pain in the neck.

09:32.400 --> 09:39.040
But if you have good GSM coverage in your area, which can be an if in the States, but

09:39.040 --> 09:43.440
if you have good GSM coverage in your area, you might want to consider looking at like

09:43.440 --> 09:45.280
your T-Mobile or something like that.

09:45.280 --> 09:51.680
And then this Nokia 27060 flip, how cool does this thing look?

09:51.680 --> 09:54.240
It's an old school flip phone with a modern OS.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.840
It's got 512 megs of RAM.

09:55.840 --> 09:58.000
Oh, well, things going to get you far.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.760
You could probably put Apache on it, you know?

09:59.760 --> 10:02.240
Can and should.

10:02.240 --> 10:03.920
Can and should.

10:03.920 --> 10:05.440
Yeah, absolutely.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.360
I mean, I hope you got SSH on it, too.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.320
Like a gentleman.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.000
Now, can we get Tailscale on there?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.360
I think you probably could.

10:11.360 --> 10:18.000
I'll put a link in the show notes, though, to the Nokia 2760, graphene OS, and the Kai

10:18.000 --> 10:19.040
OS devices.

10:19.040 --> 10:23.280
I think somewhere in there, there might be a solution.

10:23.280 --> 10:31.600
I am really considering if it works out, the Pixel 6 and graphene OS, my biggest hesitation

10:31.600 --> 10:33.120
would be the camera.

10:33.120 --> 10:36.160
I'm not saying I'm going to do this, but one of the things that's in the back of my mind

10:36.160 --> 10:38.720
is maybe I just switch to a point and shoot.

10:38.720 --> 10:39.760
I don't know.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.880
I don't know, because like, you know, I'm in the studio and I need to get a picture

10:42.880 --> 10:43.440
or something.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.920
Like, it's the convenience of the smartphone.

10:45.920 --> 10:51.040
So, I need a camera that's good enough for like the day-to-day, like I just need to capture

10:51.040 --> 10:51.600
this.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.720
Something to become one of those folks.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.280
You just got to kind of always dangle it on your neck.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.320
Yeah, like my grandbeast.

10:56.320 --> 10:57.360
You got your overalls on.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.400
Pens and stuff, right?

10:58.400 --> 10:59.600
I'm going to have like a camera.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.800
Send your pocket protectors.

11:00.800 --> 11:02.080
Two different phones.

11:02.720 --> 11:07.440
I think, though, Chris, if you can find a point and shoot that can handle something

11:07.440 --> 11:11.680
like photo sync or something, you know, an easy way to get those photos off of that camera,

11:11.680 --> 11:17.120
I think that's really where that would fall apart for you, because if, you know, to take

11:17.120 --> 11:20.240
the card out and put it in a computer, I've seen you try to do that after a trip.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.240
You know, it happens, but not always right away.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.440
They got them Wi-Fi.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.240
They do.

11:24.240 --> 11:24.720
It's true.

11:24.720 --> 11:27.040
With the auto transfers, you know what I'm saying?

11:27.840 --> 11:28.400
You like that?

11:29.120 --> 11:30.160
The auto transfer.

11:30.160 --> 11:31.200
Geek Squad, you've sold me.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.000
The auto transfer.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.200
Who knows if it works, though, with Linux or like does it require a desktop client or

11:37.200 --> 11:37.840
something like that?

11:37.840 --> 11:41.040
So much exploring still to do, I have to say.

11:41.040 --> 11:52.960
And then, amazingly, incredibly, for a fourth week in a row, by an absolute miracle, John

11:52.960 --> 11:57.360
A is a baller booster with 50,000 SATs.

11:57.360 --> 11:57.860
Wow.

11:57.860 --> 12:00.640
Keep the change, you filthy animal.

12:00.640 --> 12:01.920
For a fourth week in a row.

12:01.920 --> 12:02.960
I think that's a record.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.520
I think technically it was a mistake.

12:05.520 --> 12:08.240
It's a mistake of absolute luck, though, right?

12:08.240 --> 12:11.920
Because he happened to boost the same thing in twice.

12:12.720 --> 12:17.760
They are different messages, but they are of the same thing.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.240
I think he thought it failed to send, so he sent it again.

12:21.040 --> 12:25.760
But the weird thing is, days in between, like four days.

12:25.760 --> 12:26.960
Not like just immediately after.

12:26.960 --> 12:27.460
No.

12:28.080 --> 12:35.280
And due to this weird technical possible mistake, he was able to send the same thing in twice.

12:35.280 --> 12:42.400
And by mistake, John A, for four episodes in a row, has been a baller booster.

12:42.400 --> 12:46.160
And again, he says, thank you for doing a show about the reasons I love GNOME.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.680
That's what we are, we're the GNOME show.

12:47.680 --> 12:51.280
Close to the last message, but not actually the last message.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.360
Amazingly so, right?

12:53.360 --> 12:55.680
Are you pulling up the last message to compare them?

12:55.680 --> 12:56.560
You should.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.760
Just to verify that I am right, and I'm not making this up.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.280
I hate when that's what I'm doing.

13:01.280 --> 13:05.520
Actually, I joke, but John A, if you accidentally baller boosted twice,

13:05.520 --> 13:08.640
and just somehow managed to get a four-episode streak.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.560
Thank you for doing this show dedicated to all the reasons I love GNOME.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.160
And for validating my preference.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.080
It's slightly different, right?

13:16.960 --> 13:20.160
John A, if you want a refund, you just let me know.

13:20.160 --> 13:24.800
I will happily send you 50,000 sets back, because you've been such an awesome supporter.

13:24.800 --> 13:29.520
But technically, right now, you have boosted, as a baller, four episodes in a row,

13:29.520 --> 13:32.160
which is a new record. Congratulations, sir.

13:33.360 --> 13:36.720
This didn't seem possible, because we're doing the two episodes back to back.

13:37.600 --> 13:38.480
Perfect planning.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.600
I am so impressed.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.800
Miracles do happen, guys.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.400
linode.com slash unplugged.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.280
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account,

13:51.280 --> 13:52.960
and it's a great way to support the show.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.880
It's linode.com slash unplugged.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.800
Burn it into your brain for when you need it.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.960
Linode is the Linux Geeks Cloud.

13:58.960 --> 13:59.760
You can feel it.

13:59.760 --> 14:03.840
It permeates everything when you're using Linode in a great way.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.600
Kind of smells like chocolate chips.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.760
They got 11 data centers worldwide.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.680
They've been hard at work for nearly 19 years,

14:09.680 --> 14:13.600
creating the best experience to run applications on Linux.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.320
The business has made it on building a great product.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.480
And I have to say, if you like to build it yourself, or you know what?

14:20.480 --> 14:24.480
If you like to just do the one click deploy thing, Linode has a lot of options for you

14:24.480 --> 14:26.480
and great support if you ever get stuck.

14:26.480 --> 14:29.040
Linode's architected in a way where they've actually

14:29.040 --> 14:33.200
staffed out 365 human support that'll answer your question.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.680
Tier one right there when you call in.

14:35.680 --> 14:36.560
Nobody else can do that.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.480
The hyperscalers aren't built to do that.

14:38.480 --> 14:42.320
They're too busy selling books and, I don't know, desktop software.

14:43.440 --> 14:46.080
And the great thing about Linode is it's always improving in its speed.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.760
Its performance is already incredible.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.920
That's why we choose to use it for everything we deploy.

14:50.560 --> 14:53.680
But they've always been pumping out new MVME, new CPUs,

14:53.680 --> 14:55.760
just better and better connectivity.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.440
Years ago, they became their own ISP.

14:57.440 --> 15:01.680
So that way they could be like, you know, absolute root mode on the internet.

15:01.680 --> 15:02.400
It's pretty great.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.720
And after you've used Linode for a minute,

15:04.720 --> 15:06.480
you'll get what I'm talking about with all this stuff.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.280
You'll start to feel it.

15:07.280 --> 15:11.200
Then you'll start to take advantage of things like their API using the command line tool,

15:11.200 --> 15:12.560
which is really slick.

15:12.560 --> 15:17.840
And it's odd to say for a command line tool, but it's also well designed,

15:17.840 --> 15:18.880
if you know what I mean.

15:19.520 --> 15:22.800
And Linode's also just packed full of tutorials and guides.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.040
So you can kind of just get your game up to the next level.

15:25.040 --> 15:29.840
In fact, I will link in the show notes a free e-book, no strings attached.

15:29.840 --> 15:31.760
You don't have to give them your email or anything like that,

15:32.560 --> 15:36.800
to get the Docker Security Essentials e-book that they've partnered up to publish.

15:36.800 --> 15:41.760
It's a decent little read and it focuses on securing the Docker platform on Linux,

15:41.760 --> 15:45.040
making sure you have some fundamentals of the Docker CLI as well,

15:45.680 --> 15:49.760
and some system defundamentals to make sure your system is protected.

15:49.760 --> 15:50.640
They're just giving it away.

15:51.120 --> 15:54.240
And obviously it's something you might want to do on your Linode as well,

15:54.240 --> 15:57.040
but it's something you could do on your home systems, your on-prem as well.

15:57.600 --> 16:02.240
That's Linode, the best customer support, super fast rigs and networking,

16:02.240 --> 16:04.320
and a Linux culture that runs deep.

16:04.320 --> 16:06.640
There's so many reasons to choose Linode,

16:07.280 --> 16:08.960
but I think you should just go try it for yourself.

16:08.960 --> 16:09.840
So let's put it over the top.

16:09.840 --> 16:13.120
Go get that $100 in credit and support the show.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.920
So you go to linode.com slash unplugged.

16:15.920 --> 16:19.920
Again, one more time, support the show at linode.com slash unplugged.

16:19.920 --> 16:25.920
Well, you're too late.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.720
One of the meetups has already happened at least as we record this.

16:34.720 --> 16:35.520
Maybe two.

16:35.520 --> 16:36.080
I don't know.

16:36.080 --> 16:36.720
Brent, do you know?

16:37.440 --> 16:38.560
Schedules are hard at this point.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.840
Dates are so hard.

16:39.840 --> 16:43.840
And I went to go check the meetup page, but I got a 502 gateway.

16:43.840 --> 16:44.240
No.

16:44.240 --> 16:46.640
Yeah, meetups happen to doubt it.

16:46.640 --> 16:50.080
Oh, no.

16:50.080 --> 16:54.560
So later, we'll have robots for you to see if there's any meetups left to attend.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.760
But hopefully, thanks for trying.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.680
I have a question, actually, Chris.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.840
Are we going to have the tracker up?

17:05.840 --> 17:06.720
Like, can people still kind of last minute?

17:06.720 --> 17:08.320
Oh, you had to bring it up.

17:08.320 --> 17:09.040
Oh, no.

17:09.040 --> 17:10.000
I didn't get the memo.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.360
I was trying not to bring it up.

17:13.360 --> 17:14.480
Well, you didn't say anything.

17:14.480 --> 17:17.920
I want to flash that device to Graphene OS, but it'll break the track.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.960
Maybe we can track Brent instead.

17:24.960 --> 17:25.600
Yeah, there you go.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.400
There you go.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.760
Gosh, it hurts.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.440
We will have some more meetups.

17:29.440 --> 17:33.200
And the last meetup is actually Northern Oregon.

17:33.200 --> 17:38.160
We do Southern Oregon, then we get down into Cali, and then on our way back up,

17:38.160 --> 17:39.040
we're going to do Portland.

17:39.680 --> 17:42.160
So, you know, meetup.com slash tubes broadcasting.

17:42.160 --> 17:42.960
You still got time.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.320
We always have links in the show notes.

17:45.040 --> 17:45.600
Y'all know that.

17:49.280 --> 17:54.560
Well, as you probably know, we've been waiting for just the right moment to give

17:54.560 --> 17:58.640
Brent his new Dev 1, because we're just being awful.

17:58.640 --> 17:59.600
Little teases about it.

18:01.600 --> 18:06.320
And we wanted him to unbox it on the show, you know, for y'all to enjoy,

18:06.320 --> 18:08.560
to capture the full experience.

18:08.560 --> 18:12.160
But then, then we decided we'd rather try and prank Brent.

18:13.200 --> 18:17.040
Okay, it's Sunday after Linux Unplugged 4.75.

18:17.040 --> 18:21.440
We're out in the living room, and I'm about to unbox Brent's Dev 1.

18:21.440 --> 18:25.760
I left it in the box all wrapped up because I wanted him to have the experience.

18:26.720 --> 18:31.440
But if we're going to install GhostBSD on this thing, we got to even see if it'll boot.

18:31.440 --> 18:32.880
I have no idea.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.600
So what I have is I have an excessively large kitchen knife.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.120
Right here. Extra sharp.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.160
Yeah, really sharp.

18:38.160 --> 18:42.240
Way, way, way too big, really for any job at all, let alone opening a box.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.720
Maybe you're carving the Christmas roast.

18:44.720 --> 18:47.200
I could be carving the Christmas tree with this knife, too.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.760
All right, this is, it's a nice box.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.120
Would you, would you like the honors?

18:53.120 --> 18:54.400
I believe the front pops open.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.680
It's like a magnetically.

18:55.680 --> 18:56.880
Oh, this is fancy.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.560
It is. Isn't that nice?

18:58.560 --> 18:59.360
Even the box is nice.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.560
Premium cardboard.

19:00.560 --> 19:00.960
Yeah.

19:00.960 --> 19:04.080
It's got a little, it's got a little, it's got a little, it's got a little,

19:04.080 --> 19:06.640
yeah, it's got a little pull tab here.

19:06.640 --> 19:07.520
It's all wrapped up.

19:12.480 --> 19:15.120
And I'll pull out the power because it's been sitting for a bit.

19:17.680 --> 19:21.760
We'll get this going and put in the USB, which you brought with you.

19:21.760 --> 19:22.960
Premeditated USB.

19:23.840 --> 19:24.880
Don't you carry those around?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.480
So Brian, it was really nice to unbox.

19:30.480 --> 19:33.840
We were, we thought maybe we could box it back up for you, but there's no way like

19:33.840 --> 19:37.360
we're going to get this thing rewrapped in wax paper and cellophane or cellophane

19:37.360 --> 19:38.160
or whatever it's called.

19:38.160 --> 19:39.840
We don't have a studio shrink wrapper yet.

19:39.840 --> 19:42.320
Maybe we could, we could put it in the food sealer.

19:44.480 --> 19:48.480
Now we felt like something really different would be fun for Brent just to kind of

19:48.480 --> 19:49.760
really shock him, right?

19:50.240 --> 19:56.720
And the idea of ghost BSD came to mind because it would be a totally unique beast.

19:56.720 --> 20:02.400
But maybe it would support all that fancy brand new hardware in the dev one.

20:02.960 --> 20:03.360
Oh, right.

20:03.360 --> 20:04.400
It's going to have pop on it.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.480
No, I don't think we bother with pop.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.840
I mean, no disrespect to pop.

20:09.680 --> 20:12.800
Yeah, get it in there and let's power it up.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.840
It's been just in that box waiting for him, you know, he's been busy.

20:19.840 --> 20:20.340
Yeah.

20:21.280 --> 20:21.780
Yeah.

20:22.800 --> 20:23.440
Come on now.

20:23.440 --> 20:25.520
I guess I don't remember what key you put in there.

20:25.520 --> 20:28.640
I guess I don't remember what key you pressed to get into the BIOS boot.

20:28.640 --> 20:29.520
It's gotta be F12.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.000
Oh, I did it.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.120
I just pushed all of them.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.200
That's my trick.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.040
That's how you can tell you used to be a sys admin.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.160
Push all the keys fast.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.000
Hope it just airs out.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.480
Okay, so F9 looks like is our boot key.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.640
And we see the Patriot memory.

20:50.640 --> 20:51.920
Yeah, that's right.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.360
Supersonic Rage 2.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.840
Legit, one of the fastest USB drives I've used.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.520
I hope with a name like that, they better live up to it.

21:00.480 --> 21:01.040
It's booting.

21:02.080 --> 21:03.040
It's booting.

21:04.560 --> 21:05.760
Oh my, oh, okay.

21:05.760 --> 21:06.260
All right.

21:06.260 --> 21:06.760
Okay.

21:07.120 --> 21:11.040
So I probably, I probably just let it go to the default.

21:11.040 --> 21:11.540
Okay.

21:11.540 --> 21:12.080
That's already done that.

21:14.000 --> 21:14.500
Okay.

21:14.500 --> 21:15.040
This is good.

21:15.840 --> 21:16.400
This is good.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.480
The fact that it can show things on the screen.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.800
I didn't know if BSD was going to be able to do that.

21:20.800 --> 21:21.360
I really didn't.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.600
You know, it's a new AMD, it really didn't.

21:23.600 --> 21:24.720
It is a pretty new setup.

21:24.720 --> 21:25.220
Yeah.

21:25.220 --> 21:25.720
Yeah.

21:25.720 --> 21:29.440
I mean, do they even submit drivers to the BSD kernel?

21:29.440 --> 21:30.960
Do they waste their time with that?

21:31.760 --> 21:32.960
Let's see if it gets to the desktop.

21:32.960 --> 21:33.760
We're going to find out.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.640
We seem to be just hanging out and the light's not flashing anymore.

21:38.640 --> 21:39.440
No, it's not.

21:42.080 --> 21:47.600
I mean, I can't blame the AMD devs for not, but it would have been great.

21:47.600 --> 21:52.160
You know, what you hope for maybe is that a BSD dev ports some Linux stuff over,

21:52.160 --> 21:54.000
so that way you can use some hardware.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.960
It's just like a new laptop, you know, no bigs.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.360
I'm going to try that again.

21:59.920 --> 22:04.720
Let's try it again and let's see if there's any like a safe graphics mode.

22:04.720 --> 22:05.600
Would that be legit?

22:06.560 --> 22:07.360
That doesn't seem fair.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.600
We might have to come up with a backup.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.720
Ghost BSD might be out.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.360
Gen 2 it is.

22:13.360 --> 22:17.120
But we'd have to, oh no, we need another option.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.880
No, we don't have time for that, Wes.

22:19.440 --> 22:25.200
No, no, we don't have enough time to install Gen 2 or any of the other ideas that we had.

22:25.680 --> 22:30.960
And you know, after that sort of heady prank energy faded a little bit, we kind of realized

22:30.960 --> 22:35.600
that maybe, maybe Papa Wes would be weird enough for Brent, you know?

22:35.600 --> 22:38.000
I mean, he's been, he's been living that plasma lifestyle.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
He's been, he's been, he's been, he's been, he's been, he's been, he's been, he's been

22:42.000 --> 22:46.480
that plasma lifestyle, he's been talking about some of the issues he's had and maybe reconsidering

22:46.480 --> 22:48.080
life on the GNOME side of the fence.

22:48.720 --> 22:52.320
It'd be kind of interesting to see what Brent thought of trying pop for a while.

22:52.320 --> 22:56.800
Yeah, we realized because we had just recorded the episode, Brent's, you know, plasma bugs

22:56.800 --> 22:59.600
or whatever, Brent's bug battle.

22:59.600 --> 23:02.480
Our takeaway was, well, I'd like to see, see his thoughts on pop.

23:02.480 --> 23:07.600
And then we started down the road of replacing pop and it was like, well, what are we doing

23:07.600 --> 23:08.000
here?

23:08.000 --> 23:14.320
There's very few new distros that are going to support hardware this advanced, so let's

23:14.320 --> 23:15.200
just keep using pop.

23:15.200 --> 23:18.880
And it is sort of the experience that, you know, you get, most users will get and it

23:18.880 --> 23:21.200
has been, to some extent, curated together.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.080
Totally, totally.

23:22.080 --> 23:26.240
I was sort of excited about GhostBSD and never given it a try, so we'll have to try that

23:26.240 --> 23:26.400
at some point.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.840
We will have to come back to that, you know, now that it's been the punchline for a bit,

23:29.840 --> 23:32.240
we got to do it with some respect and actually try it out.

23:32.960 --> 23:36.560
I've had my dev one for just over three months.

23:36.560 --> 23:43.120
We reviewed the dev one, my first impressions in episode 462 of Linux Unplugged, and we're

23:43.120 --> 23:47.680
recording 477 right now, but we'll have a link in the show notes if you'd like to check

23:47.680 --> 23:48.720
out my first impressions.

23:50.320 --> 23:54.560
I was impressed enough at the end of that first review that we bought one for Brent

23:54.560 --> 23:55.840
at the end of the review.

23:55.840 --> 24:01.680
We wanted to replace his old trusty ThinkPad, which he had done a pretty good job of Frankensteining

24:01.680 --> 24:04.560
together with Alex to make it remain usable.

24:04.560 --> 24:10.640
But when we launched JupyterTube, we kind of just threw a new workload at it.

24:11.200 --> 24:17.600
That H.264 encoding, that's hard for an old laptop, and we wanted a machine for Brent

24:17.600 --> 24:23.360
that could handle the workload of recording the pod without kicking the fans up super

24:23.360 --> 24:23.680
high.

24:23.680 --> 24:27.920
Chris, you're actually, you're forgetting what we were doing at first, which is doing

24:27.920 --> 24:33.840
video on the X240 that I had and then doing the audio on the X250 to spread the load out.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.920
I was just summarizing, but yeah, you're right.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.160
It was we tried to spread the workload out.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.360
It still was too much.

24:39.360 --> 24:40.160
It really was.

24:40.160 --> 24:45.360
And so we realized, you know, one dev one could handle the work that these two laptops

24:45.360 --> 24:45.840
were doing.

24:45.840 --> 24:46.160
Yeah.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.720
And so it seemed like a good choice.

24:48.720 --> 24:54.560
You know, modern, fast hardware, native Linux support, all upstream drivers, a fair amount

24:54.560 --> 24:55.120
of IO.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.920
It's a good form factor for a traveling brand.

24:57.920 --> 24:58.160
Yeah.

24:58.160 --> 24:59.360
14 inch screen.

24:59.360 --> 25:03.440
You know, you could it's got USB ports, which is nice for hooking up interfaces and

25:03.440 --> 25:04.240
stuff.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.600
Easily upgradable.

25:05.600 --> 25:09.840
You can get to the RAM and the MVME and the Wi-Fi and stuff like that in like 30 seconds

25:09.840 --> 25:11.040
if you got the right screwdriver.

25:11.600 --> 25:12.160
That is key.

25:13.200 --> 25:17.680
And it's a well-supported device and it's an interesting device.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.600
You know, HP just came out of nowhere with this thing.

25:19.600 --> 25:20.720
Yeah, really.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.120
And they kind of managed to pull it off, at least I think so.

25:24.080 --> 25:28.640
I'm curious to know if you think so, Brent, because if anybody's going to find something

25:28.640 --> 25:30.560
wrong with it, and I mean, this is a compliment.

25:30.560 --> 25:30.960
Thank you.

25:30.960 --> 25:32.000
It's going to be you.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.600
So how many days have I had this thing now?

25:33.600 --> 25:35.520
I guess the first day, was it?

25:35.520 --> 25:39.760
No, it was on Tuesday, Tuesday, since Tuesday and Sunday to currently Sunday.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.520
So it's early days.

25:41.520 --> 25:42.480
I'll put that there.

25:42.480 --> 25:45.440
But I think first impressions are actually really great.

25:45.440 --> 25:53.200
I mean, I'm there's a bit of a hardware chasm that I'm jumping from the X250 to the Dev1,

25:53.200 --> 25:54.800
which is welcomed.

25:54.800 --> 26:02.240
And I want to say a huge thanks as well to Jeff, listener Jeff, who chipped in and even

26:02.240 --> 26:07.760
sent to my cabin 64 gigs of RAM to throw in this thing, to just max it out.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.440
Which Brent has installed.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.720
Yeah, huge thank you.

26:11.840 --> 26:16.800
We had to have many conversations back and forth because I guess RAM is hard to find

26:16.800 --> 26:20.880
in Canada and shipping cross-border just doesn't make any financial sense.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.560
So we got that.

26:22.560 --> 26:23.920
Well, thank you, Jeff.

26:23.920 --> 26:25.200
That is fantastic.

26:25.200 --> 26:26.320
This thing specked out.

26:26.320 --> 26:29.040
Yeah, he's got 64 gigs of RAM in the Dev1 now.

26:29.040 --> 26:30.080
I don't even know what to do with it.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.360
I'm ready for Ken, exactly.

26:31.360 --> 26:32.720
Also, yeah, totally.

26:32.720 --> 26:36.720
Also, just a shout out to listener Jeff, he's given us a really solid parking spot on the

26:36.720 --> 26:37.520
road trip.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.840
So that's he's installing power just for you.

26:39.840 --> 26:40.640
I love you, Jeff.

26:40.640 --> 26:41.360
That's so great.

26:42.000 --> 26:48.640
So your initial, though, testing, you spend a day or two, at least with the stock 16 gigs

26:48.640 --> 26:50.800
or whatever it comes with before you upgrade it.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.440
Yeah, and I will say, we'll hit this later in the show.

26:53.440 --> 26:57.040
We did some benchmarking and stuff with just the stock specs.

26:57.040 --> 27:00.960
But as far as my personal experience goes, those first few days with the 16 gigs was

27:00.960 --> 27:02.720
just great.

27:02.720 --> 27:07.840
And I have to admit, unfortunately, at this point that I haven't noticed a difference

27:07.840 --> 27:09.760
since upgrading to the 64 gigs.

27:09.760 --> 27:14.720
I mean, it's capacity more than speed, and I'm not sure I've thrown enough maybe enough

27:14.720 --> 27:17.280
VMs or whatnot at it just yet.

27:18.080 --> 27:19.120
There will be time for that.

27:19.120 --> 27:19.920
There will be time.

27:19.920 --> 27:23.360
But it was out of the box running pretty amazingly for me.

27:23.360 --> 27:26.480
I got to say, your day to day workload, you probably don't need 64.

27:26.480 --> 27:32.480
I think there's room for some workloads I just haven't allowed myself.

27:33.120 --> 27:36.880
There's some gaming stuff that will be very interesting.

27:36.880 --> 27:40.560
And I think there's also something to be said for some future proofing.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.240
You know, install it now.

27:42.240 --> 27:45.760
Don't have to think about it for the next, you know, I've used my other laptops typically

27:45.760 --> 27:47.840
for about five years or so at a time.

27:47.840 --> 27:48.080
Right.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.440
So there's something there.

27:49.440 --> 27:54.160
Well, and that's kind of what I like about your perspective on this review is most people

27:54.160 --> 27:58.320
aren't doing a podcast or, you know, talking out their ass about technology all the time.

27:58.320 --> 27:58.960
Is that what we do?

28:00.000 --> 28:00.240
Sure.

28:00.800 --> 28:04.080
So, like, you don't really need to upgrade your laptop or you at least don't have the

28:04.080 --> 28:04.560
excuse.

28:05.280 --> 28:11.200
But when you make it, when you make a decision upgrade, you want to see a decent return on

28:11.200 --> 28:11.920
that.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.200
And so that was kind of the angle.

28:13.200 --> 28:14.240
You should improve, right?

28:14.240 --> 28:14.640
Right.

28:14.640 --> 28:16.800
Easier time, you should get more stuff done.

28:16.800 --> 28:17.520
Palatable.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.360
Should be a palatable upgrade difference, right?

28:19.360 --> 28:22.800
You should be able to taste and see the difference when using the computer.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.800
Otherwise, what are you spending all your hard earned money for?

28:24.800 --> 28:24.960
Right.

28:24.960 --> 28:26.640
Things are so expensive right now.

28:26.640 --> 28:31.360
And that was the angle that Brent took on this review is he really looked at like, here's

28:31.360 --> 28:32.000
what I did before.

28:32.000 --> 28:32.960
Here's what I'm doing now.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.160
Here's what the numbers say.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.040
Can I really see a value difference here?

28:37.040 --> 28:40.480
And so I'm curious to know your thoughts there, Brent, from just like sitting down using the

28:40.480 --> 28:43.680
machine, launching the applications you use every day, browsing the web.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.080
Does it feel palatably faster?

28:46.080 --> 28:47.360
Can you taste the difference?

28:47.360 --> 28:51.600
I think I have to separate out a little bit about the new interface for me.

28:52.160 --> 28:56.480
So I'm trying to set that aside because I think the interface, you know, being new to

28:56.480 --> 29:00.720
the GNOME paradigm, that is slowing me, the human down.

29:01.440 --> 29:08.480
But as far as the machine and its responsiveness, I'd say it hasn't ever really been a problem

29:08.480 --> 29:09.520
since I've been on this thing.

29:09.520 --> 29:15.520
What I am noticing as one of the biggest differences is the heat that's coming.

29:15.520 --> 29:19.280
That's coming off of it, which my cats love the heat from the old machine.

29:19.280 --> 29:20.000
So there's that.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.680
I'll have to have a conversation with them.

29:21.680 --> 29:24.160
We can get you a separate cat blanket or something.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
Keep the old laptop around just for the cats.

29:28.000 --> 29:28.500
Right.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.720
But also the noise.

29:31.440 --> 29:38.720
That's one thing that just kind of got to me after a while is this low, well, this constant

29:38.720 --> 29:41.040
high pitch, high pitched fan noise.

29:41.040 --> 29:45.920
And it's just like a very tiny hair blower going at all times.

29:45.920 --> 29:50.400
You know, and if I was working on the website recently, actually doing a bunch of like building

29:50.400 --> 29:55.360
of the Hugo website locally seemed to really push the laptop in ways that I wasn't used

29:55.360 --> 29:57.520
to in the sense that builds.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.320
Yeah, it was a lot of multitasking.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.840
So having lots of browser windows open, you know, certainly listening to music at the

30:03.840 --> 30:09.120
same time, having a, you know, a Docker build happening as well with like live updates going

30:09.120 --> 30:13.760
on when I'm testing a bunch of the PRS that have come in from wonderful listeners who've

30:13.760 --> 30:14.480
submitted some.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.840
So that's what I found really started that.

30:17.840 --> 30:23.760
And also doing our live podcast, of course, started tipping me into the territory of thinking

30:23.760 --> 30:27.040
that that laptop, its time has just come to an end.

30:28.240 --> 30:35.200
And so I'm noticing on this new hardware that the dev one just I haven't yet hit its boundaries

30:35.200 --> 30:35.600
at all.

30:35.600 --> 30:40.400
And I'm going to be curious what it will take for me to eventually hit that point because

30:41.120 --> 30:45.760
I feel like there's way more room than I even realize is there for me.

30:45.760 --> 30:46.320
I agree.

30:46.320 --> 30:51.040
As somebody who's been using it for just over three months, the boundary I hit with it is

30:51.040 --> 30:51.440
gaming.

30:52.160 --> 30:54.480
It's when I have it hooked up to external monitors.

30:55.200 --> 31:01.040
If I just set to like a 1080p or 720p resolution, there's basically no game that laptop can't

31:01.040 --> 31:01.840
play.

31:01.840 --> 31:04.800
And it doesn't have like a fancy dedicated GPU.

31:04.800 --> 31:09.200
Now, and for somebody that's kind of casual like me, I hate to say that, but it is kind

31:09.200 --> 31:09.600
of true.

31:10.720 --> 31:12.000
It's busy.

31:12.000 --> 31:12.960
It's incredible.

31:12.960 --> 31:17.840
I hook up an Xbox controller and I launch the game and there's just about everything

31:17.840 --> 31:18.320
I can play.

31:18.320 --> 31:20.080
And that does push the machine to its max.

31:20.080 --> 31:23.200
And I encouraged you, Brent, to kind of test gaming, even though I know you're not a big

31:23.200 --> 31:23.520
gamer.

31:23.520 --> 31:27.600
But in part, you're not a big gamer because you haven't been able to game.

31:27.600 --> 31:28.960
That's exactly it.

31:28.960 --> 31:30.480
Yeah, you encouraged me, thankfully.

31:30.480 --> 31:31.520
Thanks, Chris.

31:31.520 --> 31:38.560
To install Steam and a few other platforms and to game as a scientific research for this

31:38.560 --> 31:39.360
here episode.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.480
Very important research.

31:40.480 --> 31:40.880
Thank you.

31:40.880 --> 31:42.560
I spent many late nights doing that.

31:42.560 --> 31:42.880
Thanks.

31:44.240 --> 31:51.280
And really, the first thing is, A, I can game now, which I'm not a gamer because I don't

31:51.280 --> 31:51.920
want to.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.400
I am one because I haven't been able to.

31:54.400 --> 31:59.760
And so to know that this laptop, which is the same physical size and everything as the

31:59.760 --> 32:05.200
old laptop is, actually it's a little smaller, can do all of this is kind of a huge realization

32:05.200 --> 32:07.360
that really I've been missing out all these years.

32:07.920 --> 32:12.480
When I opened Steam, it told me that the last time I'd played Portal, which I guess was

32:12.480 --> 32:14.960
the last game I played, was in 2014.

32:15.760 --> 32:16.560
Oh, Brent.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.120
I know.

32:17.120 --> 32:18.960
And that just made my heart sink.

32:18.960 --> 32:20.640
I was like, gee, what am I doing to myself?

32:20.640 --> 32:22.400
I should allow myself some fun here.

32:22.400 --> 32:23.200
You deserve that.

32:23.200 --> 32:24.080
You work hard.

32:24.080 --> 32:24.960
You deserve that.

32:24.960 --> 32:28.800
So I need some recommendations on what I should be playing these days.

32:28.800 --> 32:29.760
Oh, OK. All right.

32:30.560 --> 32:33.360
You know, I'm going to bring the Steam Deck on the road trip.

32:33.360 --> 32:33.920
Yeah.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.160
So I haven't actually tried a game on it yet.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.360
I only tried desktop mode.

32:37.360 --> 32:41.360
We're totally going to play some Teenage Ninja Turtles Shredder's Revenge.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.080
Bring it on.

32:42.080 --> 32:42.560
Yeah.

32:42.560 --> 32:42.960
Yeah.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.240
You could play it on the laptop, too.

32:44.960 --> 32:46.720
Yeah, it is great to have that option.

32:46.720 --> 32:50.080
I mean, you're not going to buy it to game, but it's great to have that option.

32:51.040 --> 32:55.600
I would describe it as it's a laptop you can bring with you on a trip where you can play

32:55.600 --> 32:56.960
video games in the hotel room.

32:56.960 --> 32:59.200
And I have wanted that laptop for so long.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.160
I don't do that anymore.

33:00.160 --> 33:05.120
But when I was when I was staying in hotel rooms and stuff, that's why I don't want.

33:05.120 --> 33:07.120
I always wanted to be able to play some video games.

33:07.120 --> 33:08.880
And of course, I thought maybe the Steam Deck would be it.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.000
But now I don't do that.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.880
Well, let's talk about some of the physical attributes keyboard.

33:12.880 --> 33:13.040
Right.

33:13.040 --> 33:14.240
You're coming from a ThinkPad.

33:14.240 --> 33:18.000
You're coming from the X250, which has a classic X250.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.440
Well, and before that was an X220, which is pretty famous for its keyboard.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.680
So you kind of have high standards.

33:23.680 --> 33:26.240
In other words, how did the dev one live up to that?

33:26.240 --> 33:26.800
It's true.

33:26.800 --> 33:32.400
Um, I found some of the layout on the dev one is I'm still learning it.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.800
There are on the right hand side.

33:34.800 --> 33:37.760
Chris, if you remember, there's like a big row of keys there.

33:37.760 --> 33:39.760
And of course, deletes in the place that you expect.

33:41.040 --> 33:45.520
But then they have like page up and how does the article?

33:45.520 --> 33:48.480
It's home page up, page down and then end.

33:48.480 --> 33:48.800
OK.

33:49.760 --> 33:52.960
And I am struggling with that one.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.120
I'm really struggling with that one, which is interesting.

33:55.120 --> 33:58.240
But the feel of the keyboard, so some of the layouts a little bit different.

33:58.240 --> 34:02.320
And I think, you know, having spent 10 plus years on ThinkPads, of course,

34:02.320 --> 34:05.840
I'm going to have to remap where I think control should be and such.

34:05.840 --> 34:08.960
So I'm expecting that kind of warm up period.

34:09.520 --> 34:12.560
So I'm trying not to be too hard on, you know, the keyboard for that.

34:12.560 --> 34:13.280
It's not its fault.

34:13.280 --> 34:13.920
It's my fault.

34:14.640 --> 34:19.200
But as far as the physical aspects of the keyboard goes, it's been great.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.560
My typing speed has been just as good.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.520
The feel of it, I haven't really thought about.

34:25.520 --> 34:27.680
And I was actually a little worried about that.

34:27.680 --> 34:31.440
I know there's been a lot of talk recently about modern keyboards,

34:31.440 --> 34:35.120
even some of the high end one like the Apple ones and such having issues.

34:35.120 --> 34:38.320
So I was a little bit hesitant there, but it turns out it's actually great.

34:38.960 --> 34:43.200
Well, when you first saw the keyboard, the first thing you asked me is,

34:44.160 --> 34:45.920
well, what about that power button?

34:45.920 --> 34:49.920
That power button is right by the backspace and the delete keys,

34:49.920 --> 34:52.560
right in that like frequently tapped zone.

34:53.440 --> 34:54.640
Has that been an issue for you?

34:55.280 --> 34:59.520
I caught myself this morning trying to hit home in that position

34:59.520 --> 35:01.360
because that's where it is on the ThinkPad.

35:01.360 --> 35:01.840
Yeah.

35:01.840 --> 35:03.760
But I did catch myself before I hit it.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.120
And actually, I did test.

35:05.120 --> 35:07.520
OK, well, what's the worst case scenario if I do hit this button?

35:07.520 --> 35:08.880
So I did go through.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.080
Pop OS has some options.

35:10.080 --> 35:13.280
You know, you can set the button to do certain things as most OS's do.

35:13.840 --> 35:17.120
And so I've set it to just suspend the laptop.

35:17.120 --> 35:21.520
And that's I think with the speed at which the dev one sort of suspends

35:21.520 --> 35:22.720
and comes back from suspend.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.040
If I hit it by accident, it's actually not a huge big deal.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.640
I have to enter my password or whatever.

35:26.640 --> 35:27.920
It's not ideal, though, right?

35:27.920 --> 35:30.880
It's sort of one of those things you're like, boy, I wish they hadn't put it there.

35:30.880 --> 35:31.760
It's true.

35:31.760 --> 35:32.560
You're right.

35:32.560 --> 35:36.480
And that is a place for a button that can do other things because that button itself,

35:36.480 --> 35:40.640
you can't assign a different keyboard action to which I tried to do, of course.

35:40.640 --> 35:43.280
You know, they've got that for dogs that like sour spray.

35:43.280 --> 35:46.240
We just kind of spray that that key for you.

35:46.240 --> 35:46.480
Right.

35:46.480 --> 35:48.880
And then if he puts his finger in his mouth, he'll learn a lesson.

35:49.920 --> 35:53.760
Yeah, I have to say, I've never accidentally touched it.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.360
But I have thought from the very moment I used it,

35:55.360 --> 35:57.280
Brent, I thought, oh, this is a huge problem for me.

35:57.840 --> 36:02.000
I think overall, the keyboard works pretty well as somebody who's been using it for a bit.

36:02.800 --> 36:04.480
The arrow keys, I don't.

36:04.480 --> 36:08.320
Yeah, I was going to say the one thing I got to be hard about is that are those arrow keys.

36:08.320 --> 36:10.480
Especially I'm learning in Pop OS.

36:10.480 --> 36:14.960
A lot of the keyboard navigation uses up and down with different function keys

36:14.960 --> 36:19.200
to do workspaces and such, and I'm struggling with the ups and downs.

36:19.200 --> 36:23.440
So is that because the up and down only take up like the width of one?

36:23.440 --> 36:23.920
Yes.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.640
And then you have the two fat left and right keys.

36:26.640 --> 36:30.320
The way Apple used to do it on the MacBook keyboards that everybody hates

36:30.320 --> 36:31.760
is the way it is here.

36:31.760 --> 36:34.720
The keyboard feels a lot better than those butterfly keyboards.

36:34.720 --> 36:38.480
But the design of the arrow keys is that same style.

36:39.040 --> 36:44.480
And if it's the only keyboard you ever use, you can map your brain to it.

36:44.480 --> 36:47.680
But when you use like a whole bunch of different kinds of keyboards,

36:47.680 --> 36:51.680
and this is the only one that's like that, it's tricky to remember.

36:52.320 --> 36:57.280
I think thankfully for me, this will likely be my primary machine, I would imagine.

36:57.280 --> 37:01.280
So I think in time, perhaps I'll get a little more precise about that.

37:01.280 --> 37:02.880
While we're talking about physical attributes,

37:02.880 --> 37:07.360
I know you think the design is pretty good, maybe better than the ThinkPad.

37:08.400 --> 37:11.600
The one thing that you said to me is that the speakers suck.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.800
And I thought, wow, these are some of the best speakers I've heard on a laptop.

37:14.800 --> 37:18.240
So where have you landed in that range from they totally suck to

37:18.720 --> 37:20.960
these are some of the best speakers I've heard on a laptop,

37:20.960 --> 37:23.920
obviously like high-end MacBooks excluded?

37:23.920 --> 37:26.000
Well, you know, it's funny, Chris, I'm glad you brought that up.

37:26.000 --> 37:31.440
Because as soon as I said that, I sort of caught myself because I then realized

37:31.440 --> 37:36.240
that actually I just never, ever used the ThinkPad speakers.

37:36.240 --> 37:39.760
I would always connect to a Bluetooth speaker that I have

37:39.760 --> 37:41.680
or plug in some headphones or something.

37:41.680 --> 37:47.280
So the fact that in the last few days I've actually used the speakers,

37:47.280 --> 37:48.800
I think is actually a huge win.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.440
Yeah, you've been playing music as you work, like all day.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.600
Yeah, I've tried not to bother you, but I guess I have.

37:53.600 --> 37:54.880
No, no, no, no, it's not bothering.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.040
But I just noticed like, we have headphones, Brad.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.040
I've never seen you do that with your laptop before.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.520
But with the Dev1, you were just playing music.

38:01.520 --> 38:04.160
Yeah, so I think my first impression was like, oh, these are going to be terrible.

38:04.160 --> 38:07.760
And because every experience I've had with laptop speakers have been terrible.

38:07.760 --> 38:10.960
And I think those old ThinkPads are quite bad.

38:10.960 --> 38:13.920
However, the more I've been playing them, it's like, oh, actually,

38:13.920 --> 38:14.960
this is super convenient.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.400
And not having headphones in my ears at all times that I'm using my laptop

38:18.400 --> 38:19.200
is actually really great.

38:19.200 --> 38:22.720
So I'm going to take that statement right back and I'm going to say,

38:22.720 --> 38:27.440
these are actually good enough and great to have as something that's convenient.

38:27.440 --> 38:30.640
And OK, they might not be the best laptop speakers out there.

38:30.640 --> 38:35.520
I know there's maybe one laptop that has a better, but they're great.

38:35.520 --> 38:38.720
And so, or great enough, let's put it there.

38:39.360 --> 38:39.840
I agree.

38:40.400 --> 38:44.000
They're good enough that you'd be fine watching a movie with these speakers.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.600
You'd be fine playing a video game.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.600
You know, you can listen to music and it's going to work pretty good.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.600
You're not going to get the full range of everything.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.280
But you know, it sounds pretty good.

38:51.280 --> 38:52.640
Like podcasts, I'm in the kitchen.

38:52.640 --> 38:54.560
I set it on the table while I'm just doing some bread work.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.720
Tots would be fine for a podcast.

38:56.720 --> 38:57.840
Tots would be fine.

38:57.840 --> 38:58.560
Yeah.

38:58.560 --> 39:02.400
Now, you did throw a lot of punishment at this machine, Brad.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.640
You and I had a lot of fun in the last few days.

39:04.640 --> 39:08.240
We compared the Dev1 to a lot of different systems,

39:08.240 --> 39:10.480
different ranges, including your previous machine.

39:11.520 --> 39:15.440
In some cases, we even ran it up against a MacBook M1,

39:15.440 --> 39:16.800
just to kind of see where it fits in there.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.160
And then for fun, an iPhone.

39:18.160 --> 39:18.560
Why not?

39:18.560 --> 39:19.360
And an Android device.

39:19.360 --> 39:22.400
Like, just kind of get the different range of stuff.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.000
Where do you want to start with the benchmark?

39:24.000 --> 39:26.640
Yeah, we tried a few different benchmarks.

39:26.640 --> 39:30.560
I was not having really done benchmarking before.

39:30.560 --> 39:33.280
I instantly went to the Ferronix suite.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.360
You've used it before, Chris, to do reviews.

39:35.360 --> 39:36.960
And I've talked highly of it.

39:36.960 --> 39:39.360
And I know it's a tool that's well used and well loved.

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
I do want to mention really quickly, I did struggle with it a little bit.

39:44.000 --> 39:48.800
I installed it via the Docker, the official Docker image that's available.

39:48.800 --> 39:54.000
Because what I wanted to do is compare the Dev1 to the X250,

39:54.000 --> 39:58.000
just to see what size that chasm is that I'm jumping with this upgrade.

39:58.000 --> 39:58.320
Sure.

39:58.320 --> 39:58.880
Thanks to you both.

39:58.880 --> 40:02.720
And I thought, well, I got Fedora on that X250.

40:02.720 --> 40:06.400
And so I want to give it as equal a chance as possible.

40:06.400 --> 40:09.280
And so abstract away maybe some of those package differences or such.

40:09.920 --> 40:12.960
So I thought the Docker build would be a good way to go.

40:12.960 --> 40:14.800
And you'll tell me if that was a good idea or not.

40:15.440 --> 40:19.040
But I did find running it actually was a real struggle.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.240
You and I struggle with this, Chris.

40:20.240 --> 40:23.600
And it does some auto package installs.

40:23.600 --> 40:26.160
But it totally misses a bunch of really essential ones.

40:26.160 --> 40:28.800
Some things we were surprised about, actually.

40:28.800 --> 40:35.760
So as a quick aside, I think probably the Fronix test suite can use some love.

40:35.760 --> 40:38.320
And I hope some of our audience might get really interested in it.

40:38.320 --> 40:40.400
Some of it I think would be really easy to fix.

40:41.200 --> 40:45.360
Some of it I was able to just install some packages myself to solve most of the benchmarks

40:45.360 --> 40:46.160
that we wanted to run.

40:46.160 --> 40:52.080
So I think that would be a pretty easy change to the Fronix suite that we could help them with.

40:52.080 --> 40:56.800
And so I think we've had such success on our website.

40:56.800 --> 40:59.200
Maybe we can shift our attention there for a little bit.

40:59.200 --> 41:04.320
We probably should have told Brent, too, like, oh, yeah, that installs a whole bunch of things.

41:04.960 --> 41:08.640
Sometimes you got to tie the pieces together in a surprising way.

41:08.640 --> 41:11.120
Yeah, there's so many tests that you can run.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.280
And not all of them have seen love for many years.

41:13.920 --> 41:16.000
Some of them haven't been updated for a couple of years.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.520
And in there, there's just different dependencies.

41:19.520 --> 41:20.560
The URLs change.

41:20.560 --> 41:26.320
So you're doing a lot of attempt to run the benchmark, discover something's missing,

41:26.320 --> 41:31.360
go figure out what that package is called in your distributions repository specifically,

41:31.920 --> 41:38.000
install that specific dependency, run it again, see where it fails, repeat the process over again.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.960
You know, I actually expected the Docker image to just have all this solved,

41:40.960 --> 41:42.720
considering it's official.

41:42.720 --> 41:42.960
Right.

41:42.960 --> 41:43.680
You would hope.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.120
You would think the Docker image would have it.

41:45.680 --> 41:46.320
It does not.

41:46.320 --> 41:51.600
And then so then you end up basically going in and creating you opening a shell into that

41:51.600 --> 41:54.160
Docker container, working inside that Docker.

41:54.160 --> 41:55.840
I learned a lot about installing stuff.

41:56.960 --> 41:58.720
It's sort of like, well, OK.

41:58.720 --> 42:04.560
And then ultimately, a Docker container doesn't necessarily have access to the hardware like

42:04.560 --> 42:09.040
the locally installed application, especially when it comes to GPU benchmarking.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.640
Anyways, these are all things you learned to say.

42:12.640 --> 42:15.680
Ultimately, that you did run some comparisons between the two systems.

42:15.680 --> 42:22.000
You did things like timing the Linux kernel build between the various boxes, 3D benchmarking.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.760
I mean, you actually got pretty far in all of it.

42:23.760 --> 42:29.360
Yeah, there was also a workstation suite test suite on OpenBenchmark.org that I thought,

42:29.360 --> 42:35.360
well, the name sounds appropriate and does a whole bunch of tests for just to see if

42:35.360 --> 42:37.840
the system's up to kind of a workstation standards.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.920
And I thought, well, that's the best thing I'm going to run.

42:39.920 --> 42:41.680
And it ran a lot of tests.

42:41.680 --> 42:42.160
Yeah.

42:42.160 --> 42:46.080
I think it took the dev one about 40 minutes to run them.

42:46.080 --> 42:52.560
And it took the ThinkPad like about three and a half hours to get through them.

42:53.280 --> 42:55.520
At one point, we thought maybe the ThinkPad had given up the ghost.

42:55.520 --> 42:56.960
Oh, man, I thought something was wrong.

42:56.960 --> 42:58.960
But no, we just left it overnight.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.080
And it just kind of did its thing.

43:01.280 --> 43:08.080
So we do have links to all of these tests where you can compare them side to side.

43:08.080 --> 43:12.240
It's actually kind of fun to see just the difference that I'm getting.

43:12.240 --> 43:17.920
Brent's OpenBenchmark results are available for you to compare against your system.

43:17.920 --> 43:24.400
So you can actually compare how your box does to Brent's ThinkPad and to the dev one.

43:24.400 --> 43:29.280
And when you visit the links in the show notes on the results page, it tells you the command

43:29.280 --> 43:33.520
you need to run to compare this system to Brent's systems.

43:33.520 --> 43:34.960
And so you can see how you fit in there.

43:34.960 --> 43:35.600
Which is great.

43:35.600 --> 43:38.480
I feel like OpenBenchmarking in that way has been really great.

43:38.480 --> 43:41.200
We've been able to compare three, four, five systems at a time.

43:41.200 --> 43:45.360
I think the real trick there, Chris, is changing the URL, right?

43:45.360 --> 43:45.920
Yeah.

43:45.920 --> 43:52.160
Well, the way it works is each result has, I guess, a unique ID.

43:52.160 --> 43:55.440
And you can stack those unique IDs with commas in the URL.

43:55.440 --> 43:59.280
And so you can compare multiple systems by dropping the result ID, comma, next result

43:59.280 --> 44:01.120
ID, comma, next result ID.

44:01.120 --> 44:04.560
So compare a few of your machines or compare it to some of ours.

44:04.560 --> 44:06.000
Install it on a VPS somewhere.

44:06.000 --> 44:10.160
I mean, really, you could take this Ferronix test suite, and you could install it on the

44:10.160 --> 44:11.200
various VPSes.

44:11.200 --> 44:14.480
And you could see how much ass Linode kicks in performance.

44:14.480 --> 44:15.600
Because that's what I've done.

44:15.600 --> 44:17.200
And you can see it in the numbers.

44:17.760 --> 44:22.640
So one number that's interesting is the timed Linux kernel build that we did.

44:22.640 --> 44:25.360
And I thought, OK, well, we all love Linux.

44:25.360 --> 44:28.640
And that's a pretty simple test, actually, compared to that workstation suite that I

44:28.640 --> 44:29.140
did.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.960
And the numbers just tell the whole story, I think.

44:32.960 --> 44:36.480
So it was a timed Linux kernel compilation of 518.

44:37.360 --> 44:42.560
The dev one accomplished this in 143 seconds, by average.

44:43.360 --> 44:45.840
The x250, Wes, do you have a guess on this one?

44:45.840 --> 44:49.840
I mean, at least twice, right?

44:49.840 --> 44:51.120
So twice is about 300-ish?

44:51.120 --> 44:52.000
OK, yeah.

44:52.000 --> 44:52.960
Chris, did you look at the number?

44:52.960 --> 44:53.440
Or do you have a guess?

44:53.440 --> 44:54.160
No, I don't want to spoil it.

44:54.160 --> 44:54.640
Go ahead.

44:54.640 --> 44:55.140
All right.

44:55.680 --> 44:58.880
The x250, 716 seconds.

45:00.080 --> 45:01.520
Right, because it's not just CPU.

45:01.520 --> 45:05.280
Right, when you're making a big laptop upgrade like this, it's disk I.O.

45:05.280 --> 45:07.520
It's the memory subsystem, yeah.

45:07.520 --> 45:11.280
But that's the kind of difference between, like, I'm willing to build a custom kernel

45:11.280 --> 45:13.120
or I'm kind of not, right?

45:13.120 --> 45:14.720
Yeah, very true.

45:14.720 --> 45:19.920
Well, and some of these tests actually recommended using a different scheduler to even up that

45:19.920 --> 45:20.420
performance.

45:20.420 --> 45:22.080
So I didn't bother with any of that.

45:22.080 --> 45:24.080
Oh, that's a rabbit hole, Brent.

45:24.080 --> 45:25.280
I knew it was.

45:25.280 --> 45:27.360
I knew you've been there before, so I didn't want to.

45:27.360 --> 45:34.080
But an actual real benchmark was how long these systems could build our Hugo website.

45:34.080 --> 45:35.600
That's something I've been doing.

45:35.600 --> 45:40.960
So Chris and I thought, OK, well, we're going to punish this with, like, sort of tests that

45:40.960 --> 45:42.000
just push it to the edge.

45:42.000 --> 45:46.000
But what about real Brent tests that I've been struggling with on this laptop recently?

45:46.000 --> 45:51.120
So recording a show today, we're using a lot of the same, you know, I've got Video Ninja,

45:51.120 --> 45:55.120
one of the pieces of software that I typically use when I'm afar to do the podcast.

45:55.120 --> 45:57.680
And I don't hear a laptop, do you?

45:57.680 --> 46:03.120
No, we're using it in real world productions and it is not making a peep right now, is

46:03.120 --> 46:03.620
it?

46:03.620 --> 46:04.120
Nope.

46:04.120 --> 46:06.320
Oh, that's so great.

46:06.320 --> 46:08.160
That's ultimately what we wanted, isn't it?

46:08.160 --> 46:08.640
It's true.

46:08.640 --> 46:09.120
Yeah, yeah.

46:09.120 --> 46:11.600
That was the real test that I think we passed.

46:11.600 --> 46:12.800
That's a relief.

46:12.800 --> 46:13.760
That's nice.

46:13.760 --> 46:17.040
I mean, it's good overall, but that's really the thing we wanted.

46:17.040 --> 46:21.040
Yeah, but I think the other test that was good was building the Hugo website.

46:21.040 --> 46:24.960
And so, as you know, it's about 1900 pages on our website.

46:24.960 --> 46:26.960
I don't know how we've collected so many.

46:26.960 --> 46:31.600
And it looks like the dev one took about a minute forty seven to build the site.

46:31.600 --> 46:40.400
It was actually a thread in our GitHub issues for the website that tracks my attempting

46:40.400 --> 46:42.720
to get my local performance better.

46:42.720 --> 46:47.920
So you have results from a few months ago, right up to this morning where I did some

46:47.920 --> 46:52.800
new tests with the dev one, and you can you can check that out and build times.

46:52.800 --> 46:58.160
But the X two fifty this morning actually did all right at about three minutes or so.

46:58.160 --> 47:03.280
But some of that history got as bad as about five minutes.

47:03.280 --> 47:05.920
So every PR I want to test was like a five minute lag.

47:05.920 --> 47:07.440
So I drank a lot of tea.

47:08.720 --> 47:14.000
I just wanted to kind of wrap up with the dev one stuff with my observations on running

47:14.000 --> 47:16.720
Fedora and Nix on there, which I've run both now.

47:16.720 --> 47:23.360
At this point, and as you would expect, because everything's been upstreamed, if you're running

47:23.360 --> 47:28.080
a distribution with a pretty modern kernel, I think probably anything five eighteen, maybe

47:28.080 --> 47:33.520
even five fifteen or later, you can have just kind of everything built in you need.

47:33.520 --> 47:37.920
So if your distribution's got a newer kernel, you're good to go.

47:37.920 --> 47:43.280
And I think we've tried arch on there to possibly I feel like we've tried arch, but I can't

47:43.280 --> 47:45.280
specifically remember.

47:45.280 --> 47:47.440
It's all been really good.

47:47.440 --> 47:54.160
Ultimately, I've ended up extremely, extremely, extremely happy.

47:54.160 --> 47:57.520
That's three with Nix OS on the dev one.

47:58.400 --> 48:04.400
It has truly been one of the peak Linux experiences I've ever had.

48:04.400 --> 48:06.160
I've gone with the genome shell.

48:06.160 --> 48:08.320
You know, I get a modern genome shell experience.

48:08.880 --> 48:13.440
I have picked a handful of extensions, but I install them using Nix packages and they

48:13.440 --> 48:15.280
just get updated with everything else.

48:15.280 --> 48:17.040
And it's been really rock solid.

48:17.040 --> 48:18.160
I get my snapshots.

48:18.160 --> 48:21.360
I can revert back and the dev one just hums right along.

48:21.360 --> 48:24.160
In fact, I think it does even better with the newer kernel.

48:24.160 --> 48:30.640
I've noticed more reliable battery projections with five nineteen.

48:30.640 --> 48:35.520
And Brent, I don't know if you've noticed this, but with pop for me that shipped on

48:35.520 --> 48:39.840
there, I kind of saw battery estimations that were a little bit all over the place.

48:39.840 --> 48:44.400
Yeah, I saw it from eight hours all the way down to like 40 minutes.

48:44.400 --> 48:44.720
Right.

48:44.720 --> 48:50.400
Oh, and my co-host Michael Dominic on Coda Radio has also said he has noticed the same

48:50.400 --> 48:51.280
thing with pop OS.

48:51.280 --> 48:52.960
And I think it's not actually pop.

48:52.960 --> 48:57.440
I think it's that version of the kernel and just the AMD drivers or whatever, because

48:57.440 --> 49:02.720
as I've upgraded my kernel as time's gone on, that has gotten better or maybe whatever

49:02.720 --> 49:07.520
is doing the guessing just gets more data and gets more accurate.

49:07.520 --> 49:10.160
So that has been nice to see over time.

49:10.160 --> 49:14.320
But what I have gone with is the next OS base and then I flat pack things like steam and

49:14.320 --> 49:18.240
I've been able to play just about every damn game I want using steam as a flat pack.

49:18.240 --> 49:20.480
And it's just totally the way of the future right now.

49:20.480 --> 49:21.360
I am loving it.

49:21.360 --> 49:24.560
It's all Wayland on my end and it's working great.

49:24.560 --> 49:28.640
It's the smoothest Linux experience I've had in a very long time.

49:28.640 --> 49:33.200
The only thing I wish and maybe they'll have it in the dev to whatever they're going to

49:33.200 --> 49:35.520
call it is I'd love a hundred and twenty hertz.

49:35.520 --> 49:40.640
Oh, you give me upstream native AMD video drivers.

49:40.640 --> 49:44.960
You give me fully 3D composited Wayland.

49:44.960 --> 49:48.160
You give me GTK four with its Vulcan back end.

49:48.160 --> 49:51.040
And then you give me one hundred and twenty hertz screen.

49:51.040 --> 49:53.440
And I'm like at peak laptop, man.

49:53.440 --> 49:54.720
You just sold me a laptop.

49:54.720 --> 49:57.680
I'm just saying, Brent, you have any thoughts on pop OS?

49:57.680 --> 49:59.840
Just mentioning that before we just wrap up real quick.

49:59.840 --> 50:01.760
Some early observations.

50:01.760 --> 50:03.200
I think you'll probably have more time with it.

50:03.200 --> 50:05.600
Disclaimer there, but just quick observations.

50:06.160 --> 50:11.440
Well, those who have been listening carefully last week, I was using the Fedora GNOME

50:11.440 --> 50:14.160
implementation Fedora 36 is for about a week.

50:14.720 --> 50:15.680
I had some thoughts on that.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.520
I believe it was in the post show of last episode.

50:18.800 --> 50:23.360
And so I'm not brand brand new to GNOME, but pops implementation is different enough that

50:23.360 --> 50:26.560
I think it warrants its own sort of conversation.

50:26.560 --> 50:32.640
I think, again, it's super early days for me spending a week, a very busy week, trying

50:32.640 --> 50:33.920
to learn its workflow.

50:34.960 --> 50:36.160
I don't think is enough.

50:36.800 --> 50:43.200
And I also think just in this sort of sandboxed experience has been really challenging for

50:43.200 --> 50:43.440
me.

50:44.080 --> 50:46.080
I'm not used to the workflow at all.

50:46.720 --> 50:48.800
And that made me very inefficient.

50:48.800 --> 50:53.040
And I have even to the point where I'm starting to look up like tutorials, like how are people

50:53.040 --> 50:56.240
even using this and how are you being efficient with moving things around?

50:56.240 --> 51:01.280
So I can use some pointers, I think, on how to just navigate windows, you know, keep them

51:01.280 --> 51:02.720
in the right place where you need them.

51:02.720 --> 51:06.160
But often just multitasking a lot.

51:06.160 --> 51:11.440
I used to use, you know, Chris, you said workspaces do the four finger swipe.

51:11.440 --> 51:12.880
And I've heard that from a few people.

51:12.880 --> 51:14.400
Cheese gave me that advice.

51:14.400 --> 51:17.040
I got a few community members suggest that, too.

51:17.920 --> 51:21.680
And I didn't find that reliable, actually, for me, for whatever reason.

51:21.680 --> 51:23.680
And it's also a huge movement.

51:23.680 --> 51:26.640
So I did some hot corners, which is working a lot better.

51:27.440 --> 51:29.120
I think I might need to change some things.

51:29.120 --> 51:30.320
I'm going to keep going on it.

51:30.320 --> 51:32.800
I think at least for the duration of the trip.

51:32.800 --> 51:34.800
I don't want to change it too soon and not give it a chance.

51:35.360 --> 51:36.720
There are some super nice features.

51:36.720 --> 51:38.160
I got to say it's very smooth.

51:38.160 --> 51:39.440
And the auto tiling.

51:39.440 --> 51:40.720
Yes, I tried the auto tiling.

51:40.720 --> 51:42.880
It's kind of really great in certain situations.

51:42.880 --> 51:45.360
It's neat to turn off and on as you need it.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.720
So I think, I don't know, maybe we'll revisit revisit after three or four weeks.

51:50.720 --> 51:53.840
I got to say, you really sound like a plasma user right now, Brent.

51:53.840 --> 51:54.720
I really am.

51:54.720 --> 51:56.480
I'm trying not to rub that in.

51:56.480 --> 51:57.840
No, it's fair.

51:57.840 --> 52:04.800
I've really adopted the horizontal workspace layout on my laptop in the later versions

52:04.800 --> 52:05.520
of GNOME.

52:05.520 --> 52:06.800
I've really taken to it.

52:06.800 --> 52:09.680
And what they're doing with Pop!

52:09.680 --> 52:13.760
OS and ultimately Cosmic is kind of maintaining the vertical workspace layout.

52:13.760 --> 52:18.720
And I wonder if maybe that little difference, that spatial difference for you, is what's

52:18.720 --> 52:19.760
making it not work.

52:19.760 --> 52:24.800
Because GNOME Shell, I think if you look at how it was fundamentally implemented, considered

52:24.800 --> 52:31.520
and designed, it was pretty much meant for every major application gets its own workspace.

52:32.080 --> 52:37.440
And one of the things that underscores that idea is that by default, although most distros

52:37.440 --> 52:42.080
change this, by default, GNOME doesn't have a minimize or a maximize button.

52:42.080 --> 52:43.200
That's so crazy to me.

52:43.200 --> 52:46.480
You can turn it on, but it's not on by default.

52:46.480 --> 52:51.200
The idea is that every major application, every major window should get its own workspace.

52:51.200 --> 52:54.640
And then you switch between those workspaces elegantly and quickly.

52:54.640 --> 52:56.400
That's why they switched to the horizontal layout.

52:56.400 --> 52:58.160
That's why they implemented the four finger swipe.

52:58.960 --> 53:03.600
And one of the things I've done to kind of take it up to the next level in my GNOME setup

53:03.600 --> 53:10.720
is I have a extension that automatically opens windows on certain desktop environments.

53:10.720 --> 53:14.480
Because like a gentleman, I want certain applications on certain desktops.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.200
So things like-

53:15.200 --> 53:18.400
We won't ask too much about what those applications might be.

53:18.400 --> 53:18.960
Hey-oh.

53:18.960 --> 53:24.160
But certain applications like Telegram, Element, they go on desktop two or desktop three.

53:24.160 --> 53:25.360
Every single time.

53:25.360 --> 53:28.400
Chrome, Firefox, they always open up on desktop one.

53:28.400 --> 53:29.520
Every single time.

53:29.520 --> 53:32.800
I get a dropdown terminal because I want a terminal on every desktop.

53:32.800 --> 53:34.320
And that's just how I work.

53:34.320 --> 53:41.840
And I think with the kind of gray zone that you're in, you're kind of in this kind of

53:41.840 --> 53:47.920
in between zone where System76 is maintaining an older way GNOME manage these virtual desktops

53:47.920 --> 53:49.440
because a lot of people like that.

53:49.440 --> 53:54.160
But when you're on a single monitor on the dev one, I'm just not sure it works.

53:54.160 --> 53:55.120
I agree.

53:55.120 --> 53:57.200
Here's how I got GNOME to work for me.

53:57.200 --> 53:58.720
And I've said this before on the show.

53:58.720 --> 54:01.200
This is the third time I'll say it and I still say it.

54:01.200 --> 54:02.240
I still stand behind this.

54:03.200 --> 54:10.960
I challenged myself to adopt one aspect of the GNOME workflow per week for a month.

54:10.960 --> 54:14.800
So for four weeks, I took something that I never used in Plasma.

54:14.800 --> 54:16.400
I never did that way in Plasma.

54:16.400 --> 54:20.560
I figured out this is the way GNOME does it, either by talking to people or chatting in

54:20.560 --> 54:22.880
our Telegram group or looking it up online.

54:22.880 --> 54:24.960
And I figured out this is the GNOME way.

54:24.960 --> 54:29.280
And I challenged myself for one week to use GNOME in that way.

54:29.280 --> 54:31.680
And I just sort of built on that.

54:32.880 --> 54:36.560
And by the end of that month, I've been very happy in GNOME.

54:36.560 --> 54:38.560
I still really like Plasma.

54:38.560 --> 54:39.440
We have Plasma here.

54:39.440 --> 54:40.560
We have Plasma there.

54:40.560 --> 54:42.880
If you look at the frames for our video, they're Plasma.

54:42.880 --> 54:43.920
I really like Plasma.

54:43.920 --> 54:47.840
I think they're doing great work, but I wanted to use GNOME on the Dev 1.

54:47.840 --> 54:49.360
And so I needed to make it work for me.

54:49.360 --> 54:50.880
I've had to use GNOME before.

54:50.880 --> 54:56.800
This is the methodology that I've adopted to kind of get in the headspace because everything

54:56.800 --> 55:01.120
in GNOME is designed from an idea of how workflow should work.

55:01.120 --> 55:06.880
Like every decision is very intentional and it's much more organized.

55:06.880 --> 55:10.880
And so when you kind of come at it with that perspective and you try to get to the end

55:10.880 --> 55:14.400
of what they were going for, now you can decide if you like it or not.

55:14.400 --> 55:16.640
And oftentimes you can change the behavior with an extension.

55:16.640 --> 55:20.000
But if you start with trying to understand and wrap your head where they're coming from

55:20.000 --> 55:25.680
and then try to just take that on for a little bit, it'll result, I think, in sort of like,

55:25.680 --> 55:29.200
you know, kind of adopting some of those ideas and you'll find a workflow balance that I

55:29.200 --> 55:30.000
have.

55:30.000 --> 55:31.360
I know it's not easy.

55:31.360 --> 55:32.400
It takes time.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.960
It shouldn't really be done in the middle of doing a whole bunch of other stuff.

55:34.960 --> 55:35.520
Right.

55:35.520 --> 55:37.120
Like a road trip.

55:37.120 --> 55:37.600
Great.

55:37.600 --> 55:41.360
Why do we do this to ourselves?

55:41.360 --> 55:45.280
You might as well use, you know, learn a new keyboard layout too while you're at it.

55:45.280 --> 55:46.560
You've been wanting to learn Dvorak.

55:46.560 --> 55:47.360
Right.

55:47.360 --> 55:48.400
They say it's better.

55:48.400 --> 55:53.440
And that's kind of like in my world why I like what they're doing with Cosmic.

55:53.440 --> 55:57.280
I really, really like what the Ubuntu GNOME experience is.

55:57.280 --> 55:58.560
I think they do a really good job.

55:58.560 --> 55:59.120
They do.

55:59.120 --> 56:00.160
Yeah.

56:00.160 --> 56:03.120
But ultimately, I got to revert to the meme.

56:03.120 --> 56:10.800
And if I just use stock GNOME on Nix or Fedora and then I just decide where I draw the line

56:10.800 --> 56:15.760
and what works for me and I use an extension to accomplish what I need, it ends up ultimately

56:15.760 --> 56:20.240
working better in the long run because it's not an isolated experience, not a curated

56:20.240 --> 56:23.600
isolated experience by this one vendor using this one fork.

56:23.600 --> 56:29.680
It's just sort of that always marching upstream design and it's just kind of like you just

56:29.680 --> 56:33.440
kind of always got to embrace upstream and just make it work for you.

56:33.440 --> 56:34.480
You know what I'm saying, Wes.

56:34.480 --> 56:35.680
You laugh, but you know what I'm saying.

56:35.680 --> 56:36.320
No, I do.

56:36.320 --> 56:42.080
I just I like how excited you are about the new rolling setup that you have as you've

56:42.080 --> 56:45.440
embraced Nix more and just sort of played with getting back on GNOME.

56:45.440 --> 56:53.920
Well, it's that and it's using all of this stuff for forever since the late 90s.

56:53.920 --> 56:57.520
And like just kind of like, well, this is ultimately what really works and you got to

56:57.520 --> 56:58.880
be realistic about it.

56:58.880 --> 57:02.480
And I totally respect that everybody wants to put their spin on stuff, different distros

57:02.480 --> 57:05.280
and makers have to have their branding and their ideas.

57:06.160 --> 57:11.600
But if you take a 15, 20 year view at this thing, everything ultimately reverts to the

57:11.600 --> 57:13.040
mean and that's upstream.

57:13.040 --> 57:14.160
The mean is upstream.

57:14.160 --> 57:20.480
So I just like the idea that I can build myself a solid rolling machine that follows upstream

57:20.480 --> 57:23.360
that has fallbacks and has rollbacks built in.

57:23.360 --> 57:24.640
It's fundamental to the thing.

57:24.640 --> 57:29.920
And I can make alterations using extensions to deviate from their preferred experience

57:29.920 --> 57:31.120
when I have to.

57:31.120 --> 57:35.520
And, you know, sometimes those extensions go away, but I'm not a child.

57:35.520 --> 57:39.440
On, you know, on net, you're finding enough customization for you.

57:39.440 --> 57:39.940
Yeah.

57:40.560 --> 57:44.000
I think there are a few things, Chris, that we should do next.

57:44.000 --> 57:48.240
One of them is I think I'll pick your brain a little bit now.

57:48.240 --> 57:51.360
I've been avoiding this, but I think I'll pick your brain a little bit now on the extensions

57:51.360 --> 57:51.920
that you love.

57:51.920 --> 57:56.240
And I'll try, you know, we'll try building that into my ecosystem here and see how that

57:56.240 --> 57:57.040
changes things.

57:57.040 --> 58:00.880
I just want you to, I'm just waiting for you to say, can I have your config file?

58:00.880 --> 58:02.960
I'm waiting for the day.

58:02.960 --> 58:07.520
The second item I was going to mention is we should do some benchmarks with this exact

58:07.520 --> 58:10.800
same hardware between Nix and Pop.

58:10.800 --> 58:13.280
I'd be curious to see if there is much difference at all.

58:13.280 --> 58:15.360
It's going to be pretty minor, I would bet, if anything.

58:15.360 --> 58:16.320
I don't know.

58:16.320 --> 58:16.800
I don't know.

58:16.800 --> 58:18.320
You might be surprised.

58:18.320 --> 58:24.720
Oh, and the third thing is, Wes, how the heck do you manage things on GNOME?

58:24.720 --> 58:26.160
Are you a GNOME user at all?

58:26.160 --> 58:29.760
I think he's using Plasma right now, but he surely has tried GNOME.

58:29.760 --> 58:30.000
Yeah.

58:30.000 --> 58:34.240
I mean, I think I kind of fall fairly close to what Chris does.

58:34.240 --> 58:40.400
You know, it's stick with mostly stock and then minimal viable extensions to make things

58:40.400 --> 58:40.960
work.

58:40.960 --> 58:44.160
But yeah, I don't mind the stock GNOME workflow.

58:44.160 --> 58:48.160
Things change, so you can't get too invested in any one thing.

58:48.160 --> 58:52.880
You kind of do as Chris is describing, kind of be willing to ride with the flow as things

58:52.880 --> 58:53.520
come and go.

58:53.520 --> 58:54.960
New extensions let you do things.

58:54.960 --> 58:56.240
Sometimes they disappear.

58:56.240 --> 59:01.200
GNOME decides that you're going this direction one day, this direction the next, and that's

59:01.200 --> 59:01.520
fine.

59:01.520 --> 59:02.720
You get a new console.

59:02.720 --> 59:04.160
You get a new text editor.

59:04.160 --> 59:04.720
Yeah.

59:04.720 --> 59:09.920
You just kind of that's part of what you've signed up for, but you get a really curated

59:09.920 --> 59:11.280
experience in the most part.

59:11.280 --> 59:15.440
Well, as a closing statement, I think I just want to say that we did include some extra

59:15.440 --> 59:16.080
benchmarking.

59:16.080 --> 59:19.440
We did some Geekbench stuff that was very interesting.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.920
It was a little simpler to run as well, which was really nice.

59:21.920 --> 59:23.600
We didn't really run into any issues.

59:23.600 --> 59:32.400
And we did this really nice Unigine superposition GPU test, which the ThinkPad failed miserably

59:32.400 --> 59:32.880
at.

59:32.880 --> 59:36.400
It got an average of like two frames per second or something like that.

59:36.400 --> 59:38.880
But the Dev 1 did great.

59:38.880 --> 59:42.080
You know, I can't give away all the details yet.

59:42.080 --> 59:46.160
But what I can say with extreme confidence.

59:46.160 --> 59:47.360
Cone of silence moment here.

59:47.360 --> 59:47.920
OK.

59:47.920 --> 59:48.400
All right.

59:48.400 --> 59:48.880
You got it.

59:48.880 --> 59:50.080
The cone of silence.

59:50.080 --> 59:50.640
You're right.

59:55.040 --> 01:00:02.560
We had a really unique opportunity because we had a super powerful system in-house.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.920
It hasn't been released yet, so I can't give any details yet.

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:14.960
So we were able to compare a super powerful system to the Dev 1 to the ThinkPad and kind

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.320
of see like, where does the Dev 1 fit in the value range?

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:23.120
Like if you could go all out and get the total baller system and you're upgrading from, you

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:28.160
know, a laptop that you've had for seven years and you're making your next upgrade.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.440
From last century's laptop.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:29.920
Right.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:34.960
Like what would like what do you what do you miss out on by not spending all of them?

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.640
Not spending all of the money.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.640
And like, I'm telling you, man.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:46.880
We got everything like power draw, thermals, like different driver race conditions that

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.360
can like we went deep on this stuff.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:51.840
So like we have some really good data.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.200
We just can't share it yet.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:55.360
So you just got to go with this on this one.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:55.840
Let's go back.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:59.360
OK, I'm all just the cone of silence.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:04.880
You know, based on some testing that we were able to do, I think the Dev 1 fits in really

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.480
squarely in the value range.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.720
Like it's not going to blow the doors off.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:12.880
You could go out and find a machine if you wanted to really spend top dollar, you could

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:16.480
find a machine, especially in the next few months, that's going to be faster.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:23.840
However, this thing starts at like eleven hundred bucks and you get like seventy to

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:29.360
eighty percent of some of that value with some very unique workloads set aside.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.040
But it really varies.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:34.640
I mean, the thing really represents and you can see what we're talking about because we

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.440
do have some of the raw data you can compare against your own systems.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:43.360
But I think the value for around eleven hundred dollars is really easily there, especially

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:49.040
when you can just simply get access to the storage and to the RAM.

01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:50.560
And it's already installed more RAM.

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:54.480
Yeah, RAM and it's already installed more RAM, so it's clearly, yeah, it was very easy

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:55.280
to do.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:02:01.360
Yeah, the trickiest part was us trying to find a T5 Torx, which Chris was like, I don't

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:01.920
I don't have one of those.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:02.720
Why would I have one of those?

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.040
Three days later, it turns out it was on the desk beside me.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:07.680
Right next to us, the entire time.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.680
Three minutes and it was a good change.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:16.800
So I will say for that eleven hundred dollars, you get some pretty amazing like case design.

01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.880
This thing is built amazingly well and I always, you know, stuck to thinkpads.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.160
And I think that was an old idea.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:26.160
It's like they're great because they're modular and they're, you know, you can buy parts for

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:26.720
them all over.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:28.480
They're very, very, very common.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.480
So it's easy to switch stuff out.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:35.360
But to be honest, the build quality of the dev one is is way better, at least than my

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:36.640
X250.

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.880
But you gentlemen have had recent thinkpads.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.800
And I wonder how you feel about the difference there.

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:47.680
My only knock is that it's a little heavy compared to my X1, but it's a better build

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:48.720
than the X1.

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:51.200
So and it's heavier materials as a result.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.720
Yeah, it feels very sturdy.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.800
Yeah, you feel in the bag a little bit more.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:58.080
But as a result, you get something that's, you know, it's a sturdy magnesium casing.

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.960
Yeah, you know, and this isn't a paid review.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.080
They didn't pay us to talk about this.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:05.520
We bought this, Wes and I bought this machine.

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:09.200
And then we sat around for months before we gave it to Brent.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.560
You know, Jeff sent that RAM to me in Canada, which was amazing.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.720
And I showed up, you know, in a few days, as you might expect.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.760
And then I brought it to Alex's when I went to Alex's because I thought I was going to

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:24.160
send that RAM just in case, you know, I meant to you surprise me by shipping that thing

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.280
because that was good.

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:25.760
Good insight.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.720
That was my intention.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.320
And then we all got busy.

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:28.960
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:33.600
And this is just some value we wanted to bring to the audience because I've had an opportunity

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:34.960
to use it for multiple months.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.560
Brent just get the first impression.

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:40.080
And we worked really hard at like checking the thermals, checking the power use, checking

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:44.400
this performance, comparing it against multiple systems in the entire spectrum.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.160
And this is our takeaway.

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:49.360
And we just wanted to have it out there because sometimes you get reviews that are like they've

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.880
had it for a week or three days.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:51.440
Right.

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.320
And now you get a mix.

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.720
You get the first impressions and you get the long time impressions.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.080
And we wanted to get an opportunity to talk about it because I think this might be my

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:00.400
laptop for 2022.

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.640
This is, I think, the Linux laptop for 2022.

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.720
It's funny you say it's, you know, your laptop for the year.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.000
Typically, I keep mine for five.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.600
So this might be my five year laptop.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.720
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.200
Go there to get started for yourself or your business.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.440
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:25.200
It's just the best and easiest way for yourself or a business to store, share and sync sensitive

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:25.600
data.

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:31.680
Bitwarden is fully open source and is trusted by millions in the community and by a huge

01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:32.720
percentage of the J.B.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:33.600
audience as well.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:39.200
It's what Wes and I use to manage our passwords, our two factors, passphrases and all of that.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:44.400
It's also what I use to manage the business secrets, the things that, you know, you have

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:49.680
to log into or credentials you need or passphrases or API keys, these things that when you run

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.920
a business, there's hundreds of that stuff.

01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.760
It's ludicrous.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.920
And to try to keep all of that, like, I don't know, in a spreadsheet or something like that

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.000
almost seems like business suicide.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.240
So Bitwarden is an essential tool for how we manage those types of secrets.

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:07.920
But something I don't talk very often about is, well, how do we send that stuff back and

01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:12.080
forth between each other, especially now that just about all the time, except for during

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.840
show days, we're all remote?

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.840
Well, that's where Bitwarden Send comes in.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:21.920
Bitwarden Send is a handy tool that you can use to securely transmit information via end

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.040
to end encryption.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:28.160
And only the person who is receiving that information can view that text.

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.480
No one in between, no one else.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:35.360
So you can use Bitwarden Send to share a typed message, or you can attach a file, and you

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.160
can even set it to auto-destruct or have an expiration date.

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:42.720
So you can be certain that after the person got the information, it didn't stick around

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:43.520
anywhere.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:48.320
And that is an element I love when it comes time to share some sensitive data.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.720
Just the other day, we had to move some API keys around for a third party service.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.840
I had them in my vault.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.520
Nobody else had them, right?

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.600
That's where something like a Bitwarden Send tool can be so handy because it's a tool

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:03.360
integrated that you can trust.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:07.120
Bitwarden also has the best mobile apps.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:10.320
I am such a fan of Bitwarden on iOS, and I've tried it on Android.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.200
In fact, Android has some really great features with Bitwarden.

01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:20.000
But man, the face ID integration with Bitwarden on the iPhone makes entering my passphrases

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.240
feel like the fricking future.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.920
I love that integration.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:28.640
And it means that I can use secure passwords and passphrases on apps and websites, and

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:31.920
I can move between my desktop and mobile really simple.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:36.160
If you're not doing that kind of stuff, you're just wasting time on things you shouldn't

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:36.640
be.

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:41.440
And if you know anybody out there who's not taking serious care of their passwords and

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:45.680
their secrets, maybe point them in the direction of Bitwarden because it's probably the number

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.600
one thing they can do to improve their security.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:48.640
You know it.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:49.680
You know it.

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:50.640
Don't argue with Chris.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:51.680
You know it's true.

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:52.720
So let's help him out.

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.800
So let's help him out and help the show.

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.640
Everybody now, bitwarden.com slash Linux one more time.

01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:02.480
Support the show at bitwarden.com slash Linux.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.920
As always, we got some great feedback.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.040
Thank you, everyone.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.240
This week's feedback, I think, is really great.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.200
Sasha wrote in about some GNOME stability.

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:17.200
Love 4.75.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.120
Brent mentioned encountering many bugs when using GNOME on Fedora.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:26.880
I've been running Fedora Silverblue on my 2016 Dell XPS 13 dev edition for many months

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.040
and the experience has been totally seamless.

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:35.280
I also run GNOME via Fedora Workstation on my HP Dev 1 work laptop, which does complain

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.000
about kernel errors from time to time on boot.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.680
But I haven't noticed anything actually not working.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.240
So the hardware you use definitely matters.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:49.920
Yeah, I'm curious, Brent, as time goes on, if you will experience less issues.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:55.840
Well, I do have a list of four bugs that I found in Pop OS so far.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:01.840
And of course, they were lovely and they were like, OK, we've got a spot for you to submit

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:02.000
those.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:07.920
So I think I'm going to work closely with them just to put some of these suggestions

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.440
in and they're little things.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:09.920
Sure.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:15.600
Nothing crippling like I experienced last week on my workstation, just kind of black

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:16.560
screens and such.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.480
But so far, so good.

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:24.000
I am a firm believer that when you use all free software drivers for the majority of

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:28.880
your hardware and when everything's upstream, you just inherently have a more stable Linux

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.440
experience.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.280
I think the number one thing you can do to make a system stable is to use all upstream

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:35.600
drivers.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.640
Do you agree, Wes?

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.000
I mean, it's all tested.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.760
It can all be tested together, right?

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.520
It's it complies with the same thing.

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:44.720
You're not having to load in an external module after the fact.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:45.200
Yeah.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.000
It just makes sense.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.120
And you know how you get that external module is the vendor gets the kernel release after

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:51.920
it's already out.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:55.760
They if you're lucky, then start doing testing somewhere around release time.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.840
And then they update their driver and publish it.

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:03.280
And then the distro maker has to then package that or you have to go get it just doesn't

01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:04.160
make sense.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:07.920
I mean, it's not inherent maybe, but it does seem to be often the way that it works out.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:11.920
It's just if you follow the stuff that's built in at this point these days, which we're

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.320
lucky enough to have, it just works.

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:17.920
We did also get Nate from the point of his stick.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:22.640
He wrote in and said, Hey, I'd love to have a conversation about Brent's KD experiences

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.000
and the team's KD experiences.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.920
So I think we will follow up on that in the future.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:30.640
I think likely we're pretty darn busy on this trip.

01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:32.800
We love Nate, though.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.560
So it's going to have a huge, amazing offer.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.200
So thank you.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:35.760
Yeah.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:41.360
You know, one thing I have found about the plasma team and the KD camp in general is

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:45.280
they've always been really good about how they've handled feedback.

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:50.160
Let's just say because unfortunately, you know, on the Internet, you don't always receive

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:56.000
bug reports and criticism in the best method or mechanism doesn't always show up in a well

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.880
written bug report and often from frustrated people.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:09:59.920
Yeah.

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.400
Yeah.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:00.560
Yeah.

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.920
Because like something has crashed, right?

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:07.280
And they have been historically really graceful about how they've handled that.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:08.880
I think that's something we've noticed here on the show.

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:12.880
So we appreciate Nate reaching out Bo wrote in Brent.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.840
Love hearing your journey deeper into the open source ecosystem.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:19.520
The recent episode had a lot of great things to say about desktop environments,

01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:20.400
including plasma.

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:24.960
I think you'd get a kick out of trying a Tyler if you haven't yet.

01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.760
I three is the de facto standard, but awesome.

01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:30.320
We spawn and others are great, too.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:35.360
The one I'm specifically thinking you'd find the most frustrating and enjoyable at the

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.680
same time is DWM.

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:43.360
The point about the discussion is that sometimes primitives are the way to go and you manage

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.680
it yourself, so it won't randomly break, although you have plenty of opportunity to break it

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:48.240
yourself.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:52.240
I do think it'll be a fun foray into a different world.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.360
I do like this idea.

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.120
Brent goes deep with Thailand for a while.

01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:56.720
Just just to try it out.

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:58.080
You know, I don't know.

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.360
I saw him mess with the Italian, but I don't think it was really taken to it.

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.400
I'll give it time.

01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.200
I'll give it time.

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:06.080
I mean, it's a it's a lot of new paradigms all at once.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.320
This is like pushing you off into the deep end, right?

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:08.800
Thanks, guys.

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:12.160
I also think he might have been struggling with I don't know for sure, but it seemed

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:17.280
like some of the newer GTK applications weren't loving some of the auto tiling suggestions.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.000
Like they didn't like the resizing that Brent was trying to do.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.480
Yeah, I did have an issue where the the tiling would only happen on the right hand side of

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:27.840
the screen and the whole left side was open and blank and nothing wanted to auto tile

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.400
over there.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.840
So it was an interesting experience.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:30.880
Yeah, I'll freeze out.

01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:31.840
Yeah, yeah, no tiling.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:32.560
Nice and clean.

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:33.520
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:34.480
Well, thank you, everybody.

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:36.640
Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact.

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:39.920
If you'd like to send in your emails, we do appreciate that.

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:45.040
And now it is time for the boost.

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:51.680
Blake Collin wrote in with one thousand ten sets coming in hot with the boost and it was

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.520
sent in using boost CLI.

01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.640
Oh, OK.

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:55.280
There you go.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:55.920
There you go.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.680
Ladies and gentlemen, nicely done.

01:11:57.680 --> 01:11:59.680
We have our true geek of the episode.

01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.480
The message simply says, install boost CLI.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:04.320
Yeah, there you go.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:04.800
There you go.

01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:05.360
That's all you need.

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:10.080
If you can do that, that's like the ultimate level of nerdim because you're going to have

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:12.720
to learn about nodes, you're going to have to learn command line apps, you're going to

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.400
have to know how to get something off of GitHub.

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:17.040
Like, you know, not everybody can do that.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.000
I understand.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.920
That's why there's new podcast apps dot com.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:23.840
But some of you, some of you, some of you, but only some.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:29.440
Gene Bean also wrote in with one thousand ten sets coming in hot with the boost CLI.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:34.560
Thank you, Gene Bean, again with thirteen thousand three hundred and seventy sets.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:41.520
OpenSUSE in the two thousand six timeframe had an awesome KD set up that I really wish

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:42.240
had continued.

01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:49.200
Thirteen thousand three hundred and seventy is my attempt at ten times leet boosts for

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:49.840
what it's worth.

01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:51.040
Nice, Gene Bean.

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:54.400
Gene Bean also boosted in with a bunch of leet sets.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:58.480
Do the shows have to be boosted via fountain to show in the top boosted list?

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:00.480
It seems that is true.

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:01.040
Yes.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:01.600
OK.

01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:05.280
Fountain list is based on the fountain boosts.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.320
That's fine.

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:07.280
You know, it's just a chart.

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:08.160
We don't have to be on the chart.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.760
Oh, we're number four today.

01:13:10.240 --> 01:13:10.880
You know why?

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:12.800
It's it's because of our ballers.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:13.440
That's why.

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:14.320
Yeah, right there.

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:15.280
So we're boom.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:20.160
We're number four again on Fountain and we always get more listeners when that happens.

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.960
I don't if you you boost whatever you want.

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.640
We are just happy that you're participating in the system.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.840
It doesn't have to be on Fountain.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:33.200
But yes, for it to show up on the charts in Fountain FM, you have to send that boost in

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.640
with Fountain FM.

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:39.440
Well, Al Carney boosts in with one thousand and twenty four cents.

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:46.000
What could be a better hype song for the Golden Dragon show mascot than Gold by the Imagine

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:46.720
Dragons?

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:48.720
Have you guys heard Gold by the Imagine Dragons?

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:49.440
Remind us.

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:51.520
Are you familiar with this song?

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:55.360
Are you familiar with this song and clip to clip?

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.960
The question is, would it be appropriate for our mascot?

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.240
Now, this is not our song.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:06.160
OK, keep in mind, this is the song for the Golden Dragon, for our mascot, the show mascot,

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:21.760
the Golden Dragon.

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:22.560
It's pretty good.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:27.440
It feels to me like I'm imagining, you know, World Wrestling Federation, you know, when

01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:31.200
they just come out and they're walking to the ring and they got their song or whatever.

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:33.440
I feel like our mascot will walk out to that song.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:36.160
Yeah, it's a pump you up kind of song.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.520
Suitably epic, that's for sure.

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:43.520
Well, Dark Year 1337 boosted in with a row of ducks.

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:45.360
This old duck still got it.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.680
This is my first contribution to JB.

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:50.560
I got these sent through Fountain FM.

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:51.680
Heard about through JB.

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.000
And I want to tell you guys about a handy way of cloning your operating system.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
It's FS Archiver.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:02.000
You know, I hadn't heard about this one before, but it looks like a pretty handy application

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:02.960
that's been around for a while.

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:08.640
Yeah, it includes this a little like command, which perhaps we can save in a pastebin and

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:14.560
put in the show notes where you can just copy essentially the SD card from one pie to another

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:19.840
pie and use some compression so that way you're not using up a ton of space.

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:23.280
And he gives some tips to make sure you get like the right compression so it's not too

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:23.760
slow.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:26.240
Supports butter FS, I see here on the homepage.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:27.840
Well, how about that, Wes Payne?

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:28.720
I've had it.

01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:33.280
All right, so the key there really in that boost is check out FS Archiver.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:34.560
That looks like a really.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.720
We could have made that a pick.

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.640
We could have made that a pick, guys.

01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:39.680
Geez, guys.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.280
Oh, all right.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:45.920
Well, we got a great boost in from Green Eagle 3,333 SATs.

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.600
B-O-O-S-T.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:51.280
I had some renovations to do, so I got fairly caught up on the show.

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:55.600
I was also able to get some SATs into Albee and boost directly in Podverse.

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.280
So Albee's the wallet.

01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.520
They're an open source project.

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.720
I've talked to one of their co-founders.

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:02.720
They seem like they really got their ass figured out.

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.840
Podverse is a GPL podcast player, and you can connect to Albee so you don't have to

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:09.440
create a whole new wallet, right?

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:11.360
He says it was painless this time.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.280
So he had some issues the first time he tried it.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:13.920
Maybe it was a bug.

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:14.480
He doesn't know.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:19.440
He says he still uses Breeze to actually move SATs around from Bitcoin chain to Lightning.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:23.680
But he's super excited to be able to boost from his podcast player.

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.320
Welcome aboard, Green Eagle.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.720
Thanks for jumping through and getting things sorted out.

01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:36.400
We got just under the 2,000 SAT limit boosts from True Grids at 1,999 SATs.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:40.960
I'd also like to mention that I'm interested in y'all covering Ham Radio.

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.280
However, it doesn't need to be more than a few episodes.

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:46.400
Maybe it would be a good excuse to bring Noah back for a limited run.

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.520
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too.

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:48.480
That would be fun.

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:52.720
He says, I'd be interested in beginner hardware setups, licensing, etc.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.240
I agree, True Grids, but we need a Linux angle, right?

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:57.520
We're a Linux podcast.

01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.600
We got to look at it from some Linux angles.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:04.800
So if anybody knows a good solid Linux angle for us to get in to sink our teeth into some Ham.

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:08.000
It'd be fun to learn about that software-defined radio stuff, too.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:08.500
Right.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:10.800
That's what I'm thinking, Westpac.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.240
That's what I'm thinking.

01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.440
Neve boosted in while we were live.

01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:16.000
How about that?

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.040
This is a hot boost.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.640
Coming in hot with the boost.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.480
3,381 SATs.

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:22.400
It's a history boost because you said you'd miss them.

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:23.620
True.

01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:25.920
Also, some number fun.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:31.200
1985 was the year we, the public, were graced by the GNU Emacs.

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:32.240
DNS was born.

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.240
We got the GNU Manifesto.

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:37.440
Coca-Cola released New Coke.

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:38.560
Blessed Bee that year.

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:40.880
Studio Gilby.

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:41.760
What's this, West?

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:42.400
Ghibli.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:42.880
Ghibli.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:43.680
Ah, OK.

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:44.320
Was founded.

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:47.520
US Route 66 was decommissioned.

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.020
Whoa.

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:50.400
Man, 85 was crazy.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.400
And the world population was roughly 4.8 billion.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:55.520
How about that?

01:17:55.520 --> 01:18:02.320
Which is then divided by 3, one for each host, and then divided by 12, the number of the Mumble Room.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.320
Oh, OK.

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.680
Are you listening live, Neve?

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:06.960
Are you in there right now, Neve?

01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:07.920
Are you in there right now?

01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:08.480
I don't see you.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:09.680
OK.

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:10.160
All right.

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:12.880
This came in live, but I don't see him in there.

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.640
But that's creepy, but also awesome.

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:19.280
So he divides it by the number of people in the Mumble Room, which is, OK.

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.000
All right, 12.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:20.720
All right, yeah.

01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:21.680
This has been a while.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:25.280
And then divide by 15, each mod and admin in the Matrix chat.

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:27.600
And then he rounded up.

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:31.920
That's how we got to 3,381 sats, guys.

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:35.680
I don't think we can judge how you make up the satin amount.

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.160
No, I mean, he really put some thought into that, you know?

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:38.800
The algorithm.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.720
Yeah, you really got to think about it.

01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:41.680
We appreciate it, Neve.

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.200
Thank you very much for boosting in.

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:45.360
That's a good one.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:52.240
And then Mitch came in just under the wire with a Go Podcasting with 3,333 sats just

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.560
a few minutes ago as we're recording this.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:55.840
Go Podcasting, indeed.

01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.200
You guys are so great.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:02.000
And also, a shout out to Famous Flame, who just started earning sats for the first time

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.320
on Fountain and then sent 200 of them into the show.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:08.480
Also, Push Up, who sent 1,000 sats to wish us safe travels.

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:08.960
Thank you.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.960
And thank you, everyone, who boosts in.

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:12.000
We read all of them.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.440
We're curating which ones make it into the show, but we do read all of them.

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:18.000
And they make us smile every single time they come in.

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.520
Thank you, everybody.

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:20.800
It keeps us motivated.

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.480
NewPodcastApps.com.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.880
Now, we have a special pick this week.

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:36.800
You know, maybe you need to integrate Rust at a lower level into your system.

01:19:36.800 --> 01:19:40.000
Perhaps user applications, not enough.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.880
And since you can't get it in your Linux kernel just yet, maybe we can stuff it somewhere

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:45.680
else, Wes.

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.480
Well, yeah, you still got to interface with the kernel to make changes.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:55.600
What if you had a Rust alternative to sysctl with a terminal user interface?

01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:58.960
This sounds pretty good.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.240
I mean, it's kind of everything I've always wanted.

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:06.160
Yeah, I mean, if you got to go mess around and, you know, slash proc slash sys and kind

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:10.320
of tune things, maybe a helper to have you not screw something up would be nice.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.240
Oh, so that's really what this is.

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:20.720
It's really the, it kind of gives you like fish type auto completion for messing around

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:21.680
with your kernel parameters.

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:24.720
Well, and it shows you some documentation as well and kind of helps you change like

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:26.880
just the, you know, change the value that you're having.

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:27.920
So look at this.

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:30.080
Interface, interfacing in a structured way.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.360
This is so great.

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:36.080
So it's kind of almost end curses like, but it is not end curses, but it is end curses

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:41.520
like you got a left pane and a right pane and the right pane has all the documentation

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.280
explaining what you're screwing with.

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:43.840
Exactly.

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:46.960
It's just the kind of thing I needed to really mess my system up with.

01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:51.600
And sometimes these terminal user interfaces are like just, just enough interface.

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:54.480
You don't need to do it all the time, but you know, for twiddling a few settings here

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:55.920
and there, it's kind of perfect.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.680
This is really great.

01:20:57.680 --> 01:20:58.160
All right.

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:00.240
So it's called Systroid.

01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:03.760
It's like, it's like on steroids, right?

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.120
That's where they're getting the Systroid.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.800
It's cute, I guess.

01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:08.560
It kind of sounds like a hemorrhoid.

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.320
Maybe it's an asteroid.

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:12.720
Yeah, it also sounds like a hemorrhoid.

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.000
Oh, gosh.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
So before we get hemorrhoids, we should probably wrap it up.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.520
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:22.800
In fact, links to everything we talked about, linuxunplug.com slash 477.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.680
Now we are live again next week from the road.

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:28.800
We'd love to have you join the mumble room because we work real hard to make that work

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:29.760
from the road.

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.200
So show up, would you?

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.480
Because we work hard for it.

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.360
Tell you what.

01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:39.040
And of course, we will stream that attempt at jupyter.tube, Sunday at noon, Pacific,

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:40.480
3 p.m. Eastern.

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.440
Yeah, that's right.

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:42.240
See you next week.

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:45.360
Same bad time, same bad station.

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.640
And the news, it don't rest.

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:49.120
It keeps going on at linuxactionnews.com.

01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:53.680
So if you're in the tech industry, do not miss a single episode, linuxactionnews.com.

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:55.360
Or if you just want to stay informed.

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:57.520
But we'll be back right here at jupyter.tube.

01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.640
We hope you join us.

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:03.120
And if you can't, we just love you subscribing, sharing the show, or becoming a member at

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:05.840
unpluggedcore.com and keeping us going.

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:08.240
Making sure the content stays independent.

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:09.360
You couldn't do it without you.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:10.480
Nobody buys our opinion.

01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:15.600
In fact, like idiots, we spend money on this hardware when they'd probably just give it

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:16.240
to us for free.

01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:17.920
But you know what?

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.680
We like to stay honest and keep it real.

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:22.880
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:37.280
We'll be real right back here next Sunday.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:23:05.840
So, Brent, I kind of have like this sense that you're not going to fully move into

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:08.400
the rig until you've decided if you're going to stick with Pop!

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:08.960
OS or not.

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:14.800
I still see you go into the ThinkPad every now and then for like a password.

01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:15.680
Well, you know what happened?

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:20.880
One of the reasons I had to do that this morning is I moved over my Thunderbird profile.

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.520
But because I was running it on Fedora.

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.080
Yeah, I know.

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:26.240
Yeah, this is what we're dealing with here.

01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:26.800
Just continue.

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.280
I wasn't just, I was just learning.

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:30.000
Processing.

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:31.600
Just processing.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:32.560
I was just processing.

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:33.600
I understand.

01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:37.040
Well, the great thing about the Thunderbird profiles and the Firefox profiles, if you're

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.800
not using Sync, I know Sync exists.

01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:39.840
Thank you, everyone.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:42.080
Is you just drag them over to the new machine.

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:42.320
Yeah.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:43.200
Just magically works.

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.480
Yeah, yeah.

01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:46.000
Been doing that for decades, which.

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.480
But the problem is I was running on Fedora on the X250, and so that was a much, much,

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:52.640
much, much newer version of Thunderbird.

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:53.200
Right.

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:57.200
And they're typically not backwards compatible whenever they do like database updates.

01:23:57.200 --> 01:23:58.640
Oh, that drives me crazy.

01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:00.400
So I couldn't get it running on Pop, actually.

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:09.040
And the PPAs that used to be available when Mozilla had Thunderbird are like 208 months

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:09.520
old.

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:10.000
That's fine.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:10.720
And haven't been updated.

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.160
That was totally secure.

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:16.000
So I actually just ran and had to run a flat pack.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.800
But that's the reason you caught me going to the back to the machine.

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:19.840
That's what I was going to ask you.

01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:21.520
I was like, I was about to say, Brent, flat pack.

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:22.320
Can't you just flat pack?

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:24.240
Yeah, I did, and it actually worked great.

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:25.040
OK, good.

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:28.240
But I did catch myself having to go back to it.

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:32.320
And I told myself a few days ago, I would not do that anymore, but I just had to get

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.280
to an email quickly.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.080
I was like, oh, gosh.

01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.600
So you are doing the challenges thing.

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.040
Yeah, because that is kind of a challenge.

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:42.240
I challenge myself to just leave this X250 at the studio when we go on the trip.

01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:44.560
Whoa, that is choice.

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:46.080
I have done that myself.

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.120
Because I feel like if you're going to move over, just move over.

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.120
Don't live the half and half life.

01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:55.520
Back up the stuff you need backed up, transfer the stuff you need operationally.

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.360
I can't wait to see how this goes.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.720
This is going to be great.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.960
I'm going to get a front seat to this.

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:07.360
Get your popcorn.
