00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,080
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,280
This is episode 96, recorded on March 10th, 2019. I'm Chris.

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,280
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:27,720
Hello, Joe. Good to be connected with you live from Scale17x here in Pasadena, California.

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,480
We have so much to get into this week, some of which I've actually got a chance to talk

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,680
to the people involved with the stories. But let's start out with a brand new fresh release

7
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,680
of Ubuntu Touch.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,880
Yeah, it's not a massive release, but it is important in a sense of they are really starting

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:48,480
to polish the OS now and concentrating on the Morph browser, which given that there

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,200
aren't that many apps available and you're using the web for quite a lot of things is

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,480
very important.

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,280
I'm just happy to see that they launched an experimental system-wide dark theme.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,040
Yeah, I thought you might notice that one, yeah.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,680
I like the name of their app store too. It's called the Open Store, which I thought was

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,740
kind of nice. They say during this cycle too, they re-enabled automated testing on their

16
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,240
continuous integration system. And then they watched as some packages failed to build,

17
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,440
which then they got to working on those things. I think it's nice to see them improving things

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,520
like testing, automated testing, and also traditional testing. But as a project, one

19
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,080
of the things that strikes me that you don't often see is how clearly they call out the

20
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:37,340
individual contributors. And even in the changelog, they don't break it out by date or a bug number,

21
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,160
they break it out by contributor. And then they individually list which each contributor

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,960
of the project got into this particular release. And I don't really see that very often.

23
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,160
Yeah, they're very community focused. The whole thing is very much community effort,

24
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:57,440
isn't it? And I remember when they first took over after Canonical dropped the project,

25
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,600
suddenly my perspective changing on it and being much more forgiving of it as a community

26
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:09,800
project rather than as a commercial one. But they really have continued over the months

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:16,040
and years to make it more and more stable, better and better and more and more viable

28
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:22,160
as a platform. It's very tricky to compete with iOS and Android, obviously. But I think

29
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,680
that there is quite a large niche market for this. And as they continue to get better,

30
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,080
hopefully they will get an OEM deal because that's the hump they need to get over. They

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,880
need to have this shipping on an actual device that isn't flashed after market. And are they

32
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,120
going to be able to do that? I really hope so.

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,080
Yeah, that's a wait and see thing. But I think for me, one of the reasons I like to keep

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,480
talking about this project is it's a brilliant example of open source doing something commercial

35
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,600
software can't. And that is over time, slowly, methodically growing a project, growing a

36
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,800
community, adding features, and just plugging away at something that doesn't necessarily

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,560
have an immediate commercial success tied to it. There's not like a three year plan

38
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,000
here to make a billion dollars. And that's not something the commercial mobile space

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,560
will even bother with anymore. There's just no company that could afford to do that. And

40
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,400
it's something open source is uniquely good at because they can play that really long

41
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
game.

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,120
Yeah, well, you reports definitely are playing the long game with Ubuntu Touch. And I suppose

43
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,440
you could say the same of purism.

44
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,960
Purism is making headlines this week when they announced, get ready for it, convergence.

45
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,160
They say we are now announcing that purism's PureOS is convergent, and has laid the foundation

46
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:46,120
for all future applications to run on both the Librem 5 phone and the Librem laptops

47
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,120
from the same PureOS release.

48
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,720
Well, I'm sitting here podcasting, recording and I'm going to edit it on my phone that

49
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,360
they shipped to me. Oh, no, hang on. They haven't actually shipped the phone yet. How

50
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,160
can they be convergent?

51
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,900
I mean, so there's a couple of things here. I think they're getting a lot of feedback

52
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,600
that the term convergence has been tossed around before and that they didn't invent

53
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,700
it, which fair enough. Their version of convergence is it they say it's a term used to describe

54
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,720
similar functioning of an app across different platforms. They say many software companies

55
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,680
have been eager to make their software convergent because it brings a consistent look and feel,

56
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,600
as well as the exact same functionality for apps to run on your phone and your computer.

57
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,720
So they are kind of acknowledging in that particular statement that other companies

58
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
have tried this.

59
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,700
Well, the couple of videos they've got on this post really do show that the GNOME applications

60
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:42,480
can be resized and kind of dynamically adapt to the different form factors. So I suppose

61
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,440
it's not all hype, but I am still somewhat skeptical that you're going to be able to

62
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:55,000
get a proper mobile experience and a laptop desktop experience with the same applications.

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,200
Well, Purism had a booth here at Scale17x. And I had a chance to chat a couple of times

64
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,160
with Todd Weaver, the CEO and founder, but also Kyle Rankin, who's their chief of security

65
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:11,640
officer. And he gave me a solid, comprehensive overview of their new Purism boot system.

66
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,520
But we did chat briefly about these convergent stuff because, you know, it's in the news

67
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,120
and I knew we were going to be talking about this. And he says this really goes back to

68
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,920
the work they've been doing for quite a while now on Lib Handy, which is a mobile adaptive

69
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,160
presentation library for GTK Plus and GNOME. They've been involved with that for a while.

70
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,400
And they've already packaged it up for Pure OS. And I believe it's also upstream in the

71
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,240
Debian repository. And there's some flat packs of it as well. This is kind of like a library

72
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,860
that GTK developers can use to make their applications responsive, sort of like a web

73
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,920
app can be responsive, where you can resize your web browser, and the web application

74
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:54,840
will rescale to match the size of the window. This is a similar functionality for GTK applications.

75
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,440
And they seem to believe in it pretty heavily. And it does seem like a solid contribution

76
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,440
to the upstream GNOME project, because this isn't just a Purism thing. This is something

77
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,720
they're contributing upstream. And it's kind of nice functionality to have. Even if we're

78
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,000
kind of laughing about using the name convergence and this theoretical world where we're using

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,880
the same applications on the Librem 5 phone and the desktops, like we can kind of poke

80
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:22,120
fun at that idea. But the core actual effort, like the manifestation of this vision is an

81
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,560
upstream library now that GTK developers can use to resize apps and make it responsive.

82
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
That's cool.

83
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,760
Oh, it is. And they're very keen to open source absolutely everything they do and try and

84
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,440
get as much upstream as possible. And it is really good to see that in a project. But

85
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,880
here's the but. They haven't shipped a phone yet. They're hyping something which doesn't

86
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:50,080
actually exist yet. And I'm sure that once the phone ships and we see it in action, it

87
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,720
will be impressive. But it just feels too early to be doing this. And they are just

88
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,560
so good at building the hype train, aren't they? We just end up talking about them all

89
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,560
the time.

90
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,640
Yeah, this is part of that. This is something they've been working on for a while. And it's

91
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,080
sort of strategically messaged at the right time as they're building towards something

92
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,240
here. Side note, I did get my hands on the libram five dev kit here at scale.

93
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,480
And how was PRS running on that then?

94
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,840
Well, I couldn't answer that. They didn't have it booting. In fact, they'd remove the

95
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,160
battery, I think in part to make sure it wouldn't power on and also to reduce the weight, because

96
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,000
the battery is quite large. It's a it's like a, you know, just a dev kit. So it's not like

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,280
a custom designed flat battery. It's a it looks like a big old battery. And the object

98
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,800
itself was pretty large in the hand because it's not quite cut down to size yet. And there's

99
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,120
heat sinks attached to the back of it and stuff like that. But the screens about the

100
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,960
size of the like the pixel of the large pixel.

101
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,320
Oh, the XL or whatever?

102
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:52,360
Yeah, yeah, the XL. But yeah, I was a little disappointed. It wasn't booting. I was I was

103
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,680
hoping that since since it'd been about a month since Fossum by the time they got to

104
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,600
scale, they'd have a functional one.

105
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,500
That does add to my skepticism, I must say, because I thought that by now they'd have

106
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:09,080
something very functional on that dev kit and not having a battery in it. That doesn't

107
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,080
look good to me.

108
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,080
No, no, I felt the same way. However, talking to Kyle, their chief security officer, he

109
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,720
seemed really sharp and the things that they're thinking about and trying to build look pretty

110
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,120
good. So they they may have a they may have a good team there might just things might

111
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,280
just end up being on a protracted schedule, you know, and maybe that's OK. Maybe we end

112
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,360
up we might still end up getting the same end product just might take a lot longer.

113
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,680
Well, anyone who's listened to user error would know that I would have been checking

114
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,520
it out. I would have grabbed my anchor battery and the relevant cable and slightly plugged

115
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,440
it in and had a good play with it.

116
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,440
That's clever.

117
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,480
Yeah, I'm surprised you didn't think of that. Oh, well.

118
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,820
Just a couple of more stories that are rounding out the mobile Linux landscape and one that

119
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,200
may be coming to a device near you.

120
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,720
Yeah, MaruOS 0.6 has been released. And although this is primarily mobile, it's running on

121
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,560
my Nexus 5, for example, and you can also run it on a Nexus 5X. What's really great

122
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,520
about it is it's a lineage based ROM, but then you plug in a screen and a keyboard and

123
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,200
mouse and suddenly you have a Debian desktop with Xfce.

124
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,040
Well slow down there sport. Isn't it news with this release? I could be wrong, but I

125
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,240
thought it was this one where they finished rebuilding and rebasing on a slimmed down

126
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,480
lineage like that's kind of one of the new features, isn't it?

127
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,600
Yeah, it was just based on the Android open source project before, whereas now it's based

128
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,880
on lineage, which gives you a couple of extra lineage features. And it also makes it more

129
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,240
portable to other devices. And although we haven't actually seen any new devices yet,

130
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,840
the whole point of this is that it's going to be much easier to do so. So we should see

131
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,920
some soon, hopefully.

132
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,040
I kind of chuckle over here, but that is the idea and it does make sense that we'll get

133
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
there.

134
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,480
But as I said, I've been checking this out and it is great. I've been following the project

135
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,320
for a couple of years now and it always just amazes me that you can have a Debian desktop.

136
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,960
I mean, it's not that complicated. It's just running in containers and sharing the kernel.

137
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,160
And so because you've got this ancient kernel on a Nexus 5, it means you don't have things

138
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:19,180
like snaps working properly. And there are a few other things that don't work, like audio.

139
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:24,760
But it is still amazing to me that it's not even particularly laggy, this Debian desktop.

140
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,040
Obviously it uses the best desktop environment in the world, XFCE, so it's going to be super

141
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,960
smooth. But it is surprising on a device of this age and power and RAM and specs generally,

142
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,000
that you can have a fully functional Linux desktop and it actually work well.

143
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,280
Yeah, fair enough. That is true. That is surprising. I know that one of the other things that they

144
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,680
added with this release is you can now hook up a mouse or keyboard over USB, where in

145
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,040
the past you were limited to Bluetooth devices. Did you get a chance to try that?

146
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,520
No, I've just got a little Bluetooth keyboard with a little touchpad on it that I always

147
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,840
use for it. So no, I haven't tried that. And I didn't get around to trying the Chromecast

148
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,800
support either, which means that you don't actually have to plug in a screen anymore.

149
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,120
So I really am keen to test it, but I don't have a Chromecast. I'll have to go around

150
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,360
to my parents' place and check it out on their Chromecast.

151
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,920
Well congratulations to the Maroo Project for getting 0.6 out. That's kind of making

152
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,120
me want to go get the old Nexus out of the drawer and give it a go. You can get the latest

153
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,040
version on their download page as well as a guide to walk you through the entire process,

154
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,680
which we have linked in the show notes at linuxactionnews.com slash 96.

155
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,040
Well on the more mainstream side of the Android street, this week on the Android developers

156
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,160
blog, Google have posted about a new monetization method for devs, which involves giving users

157
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:51,800
the option to watch video adverts instead of actually paying for things.

158
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,260
Have you ever seen this? We've got like a free game and you die or something happens

159
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:02,240
and it's like, watch a video and get extra gems or get another replay or resume your

160
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,240
progress and if you watch the video, it's like a 30 second Google ads ad video thing

161
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,680
and then it takes you back to the game and you get whatever reward, whatever incentive

162
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:19,560
they promise to make you watch that ad. This is on my kids' games all the time too. They'll

163
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,560
just sit there and watch the videos. They love it. They think it's a great deal. So

164
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:31,120
far this has been up to each individual developer to implement in their own fancy, however they

165
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,600
want to do it. And so what Google's doing now is, hey, let's just give you a system

166
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:43,560
wide Google play based API to do this and then we can all make money. And the only people

167
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:50,000
that lose are the users, Joe, the users win by getting cool rewards in their games.

168
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,040
Google play is excited to announce the rewarded products, a new product type now available

169
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,480
in the open beta in your play console have added developers.

170
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,600
It does feel like some black mirror episode or something, doesn't it? Where you saw forced

171
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,600
to watch these videos.

172
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,200
Yeah, I actually think it's going to be horrible for Android because there's already so much

173
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,640
pressure for all of the apps to be free and all of these weirdo ways they try to monetize.

174
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,620
This is sort of like a blessed way now and you're just going to get tons and tons of

175
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,640
Google ads videos and Google's making money on both ends of the deal because when you

176
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,240
put it on the Google ads network, they're making money and when you do a transaction

177
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,600
through the Google play API, they're taking a cut. So it's just wonderful for them.

178
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,440
It really is them doubling down on it being a sort of budget OS though, isn't it? It's

179
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,520
not premium like iOS where you just expected to spend the couple of bucks or whatever for

180
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:46,800
the app. This is just them really accepting that it is a second rate monetization system.

181
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,800
It seems that way to me and it also seems like it's going to lead to a lot more advertisements

182
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
on the platform.

183
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,400
I do wonder if you've got root and add away, whether you'll be able to say, yes, I'll watch

184
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,720
the video and then it just won't load and it'll skip it.

185
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,660
I hope so. That would be great actually. Not that I want to steal or anything like that,

186
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,720
but also I don't want ads on my phone. I really don't. I don't like having ads on my mobile

187
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:16,320
device. And so I would be much more inclined to root after years and years now of not rooting.

188
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,280
This would probably put me back into that camp.

189
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,920
The thing is though, it looks like this is going to be an option for people. It's either

190
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:28,960
pay and have this freemium model and pay for your rewards or go the advertising route.

191
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,920
It's kind of choice, which is good, isn't it?

192
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,480
Well, it's up to the developer. It's up to the developer if they want to offer that.

193
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,480
I would love for that to be the way it goes, Joe, but I'm skeptical.

194
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,880
Yeah, I suppose they'll have metrics, won't they? These devs for how many people actually

195
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,720
are paying for these add-ons in the apps and it's probably not a lot of people on Android.

196
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,000
And so I think this is going to be very popular with them.

197
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,760
Well the consumer market might be a hot mess for Google, but the enterprise market seems

198
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:00,640
like it could be shaping up quite nicely for Google's Glass. Yes, Google Glass, a new generation

199
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
even.

200
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,840
Yeah, we talked about this way back on episode 11 of Linux Action News when they had a kind

201
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:14,080
of second generation at the time, Google Glass, which was very much aimed at industry. And

202
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,120
now there are some leaks of a second generation of that device, essentially the third generation

203
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,720
of Google Glass, which means it obviously must have done well for them. And they have

204
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,440
finally found the niche for Google Glass.

205
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,020
Just as an aside, one of the things about this story that jumps out to me is now we

206
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:36,360
have the second most prominent augmented reality product in the market that is focused solely

207
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:43,840
at the enterprise. Recently, Microsoft announced HoloLens 2, which also is focused at the

208
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,760
enterprise. And now here we have Google Glass Enterprise Edition. And these latest leaks

209
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,160
seem to indicate it's a nice upgrade. First of all, the biggest change is USB-C. You're

210
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,360
getting USB-C for charging. That seems pretty nice. But according to 9to5Google, there's

211
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,200
other things that are pretty big upgrade in this thing too. It's going to go with a Snapdragon

212
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:10,520
710. It's going to have onboard LTE 802.11ac. The camera is going to go from an 8 megapixel

213
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:17,760
sensor to a 32 megapixel sensor with 4K video recording. They're also upgrading the RAM

214
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:24,720
from 2 gigs to 3 gigs. It's essentially a mid to high range Android smartphone in a

215
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,360
very specific form factor that wraps around your brain noodle.

216
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:34,100
And so, of course, this means yet more Linux in industry and enterprise, not only on the

217
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,800
device itself, but also you've got to figure it's connecting to servers and uploading the

218
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:46,080
data and downloading the data. And the chances are that's going to be running on Linux probably

219
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,400
on AWS or at least in the cloud somewhere.

220
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,040
Oh, yeah, for sure. It's Linux all the way down. And let's also be clear, this isn't

221
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,480
going to stay in the enterprise forever. Soon we'll be all walking around with Linux computers

222
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,400
connected to the cloud wrapped around our head. I'm not sure how I feel about that.

223
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:08,440
But why don't we change gears and talk about the biggest story of the week? And that is

224
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:14,560
Microsoft announcing the open sourcing of Windows calculator.

225
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,580
Now that's how everyone has covered this, right? The fact that, oh, it's just a joke

226
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:26,880
and it's the most minor part of Windows. But there's actually a more nuanced take on this.

227
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,520
And it's right there in Microsoft's post about this. And they say, reviewing the calculator

228
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:39,000
code is a great way to learn about the latest Microsoft technologies like Universal Windows

229
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,880
Platform, XAML, and Azure Pipelines. And that is the crux of this. It's not just them doing

230
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,960
it for fun. It's to try and entice devs in and to say, look, this is an example of some

231
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:59,080
of the legacy code of actually doing the calculation stuff. But here's how it actually ties into

232
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,620
Windows 10. This is the example code that you can then use to build your applications

233
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,280
to learn about how to build applications. And so it's a way of pulling people in. And

234
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,960
therefore, I think it's a very smart move by Microsoft.

235
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,080
Yeah, it is. It is a great way to sort of dip your toes in without it being overwhelming.

236
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,480
And the thing is, is that it's sort of a fascinating application. Because in some ways, it's a

237
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,120
very modern designed Windows application. But some elements of it, like core parts of

238
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,160
the code base, go all the way back to 1995. I was chatting with Mark Goodner, who is the

239
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,940
program manager for Visual Studio at Microsoft here at scale. And he and I were joking about

240
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,480
what's going to be the next application that Microsoft is going to open source. And he

241
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,440
and I are pulling for it to be Minesweeper. I think that'd be pretty awesome.

242
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
Solitaire, maybe.

243
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,080
One of the things that is interesting about this is there is already a whole bunch of

244
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,960
issues that has been submitted against this. In fact, Microsoft has already merged some

245
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:00,660
of the community fixes into the upstream code base. It is, in all senses, a genuine open

246
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,040
source project now.

247
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,960
It's weird to think that, isn't it? That Microsoft have got a properly open source project of

248
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,960
any kind, never mind all of the other ones they've got. If you told us that 10 years

249
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,200
ago, we would have just not believed you.

250
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,600
Yeah, pretty much. I would be really actually fascinated to see if they open source future

251
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,840
versions. And will this ship in the next major version of Windows, the next major version

252
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:35,160
of calc.exe that gets updated? Will it be this version that has been patched by community

253
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,980
members? My sense is it will be. And then we will have an official Microsoft Windows

254
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,720
application that is being modified, improved and updated by the open source community.

255
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,640
It's not a big deal when it's calc.exe. But if it's MMC.exe, or something that's much

256
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,480
more significant, like a control panel applet or something, that all of a sudden starts

257
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,000
to become a very big deal.

258
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,640
Could it possibly be the tip toeing towards open sourcing the whole shell, if not the

259
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,120
NT kernel? Seems unlikely, but it's what a lot of people hope.

260
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,920
I'm not going that far yet. I'm not going that far. It could end here. And I think it's

261
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:16,240
worth remembering it's MIT licensed. It's not like they're GPLing all the things here.

262
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,320
I still don't believe they're building towards a Windows shell that runs on top of a Linux

263
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,040
device. At least not yet. I think today it's just calc.exe.

264
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,960
However, like many, many efforts out of Microsoft, when you dig into it, you realize this has

265
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,400
been in the works for a really long time. Like just the basics were up on GitHub back

266
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,200
in January. We're only finding out about it now. But things like Visual Studio Code and

267
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,720
.NET Core were in works for four or five years before they were ever public. So whatever

268
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,840
their next move is, it's already been in the works for quite a while. And when we find

269
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,160
out about it, it'll be after months and months of them working on it. So it's a weird thing

270
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,560
to think about. But right now, the next move is already well underway. And it's just up

271
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,920
to us to figure out what it is.

272
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,280
Well, I'm going to go out on a limb and have a wild prediction that they will open source

273
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,800
the whole shell. And then within a couple of days, someone will get it running on the

274
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
next.

275
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:15,480
I tell you what, if they package that up, I give it a go. Why not? I've tried crazier

276
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
things.

277
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,160
So, before we get out of here then, I know you're going to talk about it on LUP in a

278
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,240
couple of days. But what's the kind of take home message from your experience at scale

279
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
then?

280
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,580
Well, first and foremost, it was awesome to see everybody. Thank you, everybody that came

281
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,160
out and said hi, and joined the meetup. We had a great dinner. But my overall big theme

282
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,160
about this year's scale was the cloud. And I don't even think it was intentional on the

283
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:43,160
part of the scale organizers. I just think it's what the community contributed as talks.

284
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:47,680
And even the talks that weren't specifically about the cloud had tangential connections

285
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:54,180
to the cloud. There was representation there from Purism and System76 for the Linux desktop,

286
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:58,400
but the hallway track this year was the best it's ever been.

287
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,520
There was elements to this year's scale that I think were just, first of all, should be

288
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:06,200
replicated by all other conferences, but just made it one of the best scales ever. I'm going

289
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,320
to talk more about it on Linux Unplugged because we also had Wes and Elle. They were here with

290
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,280
me and want to get their thoughts on it too. We'll do a little story time on this week's

291
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,280
Linux Unplugged.

292
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:18,220
I look forward to it. But I'm not surprised that it was all about the cloud because follow

293
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:22,560
the money. That's where the money is in Linux, right? So people are going to be talking about

294
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,560
that.

295
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,480
Yeah, we'll be talking about that and a lot more. And so will we, Joe. Go to linuxactionnews.com
