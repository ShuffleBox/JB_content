00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,280
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,400
This is episode 65, recorded on August 5th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,400
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
And I'm Tom.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,400
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,080
It's good to be connected with you.

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,200
And I have to say, I'm not yet broadcasting from a tablet, but it may be in my future.

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:37,320
Yes, Samsung has revealed the Galaxy Tab S4, which on the face of it is a fairly unremarkable

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,320
tablet.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,000
But then you realize it's got this DEX software in it, which allows you to run a proper desktop

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,240
on Android, which we've seen many times before.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,400
And it seems that they're going to have yet another go at it.

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,400
Right.

14
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,080
To connect this S4 tab to a monitor, both the big screen and the tablet screen can be

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,760
used simultaneously.

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,840
Samsung had a short demo they were showing to the press.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,360
And during that, they showed opening up to 20 windows at once.

18
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,020
You had features like split screen, drag and drop.

19
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,120
And it essentially functioned like a windowing desktop environment on a PC.

20
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,760
They also mentioned that users will be able to launch the DEX software without being connected

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
to a monitor.

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:24,960
So you essentially get like an Android UI on the tablet's 10.5 inch screen, which is

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,680
2560 by 1600.

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,160
So it's a pretty big display.

25
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,960
You could fit a few windows on that thing.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,340
But it wasn't long ago that we were talking about the DEX dock and being able to turn

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:38,440
a phone into a proper Linux machine.

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,120
Makes you wonder why can't you do that on this then?

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,520
And what happened to that project?

30
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,760
So this is, to be clear, an Android desktop environment with Android applications.

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,360
In the past, when we were talking about the DEX dock, that was a Linux environment that

32
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,700
could run some Android applications.

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,080
So there seems to have been a focus change here.

34
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,320
And that might just simply be because you already have large companies like Adobe and

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:10,480
Microsoft and Google themselves that are working on windowed desktop style Android applications.

36
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,320
Maybe they just put their finger up, detected the way the wind was going and changed.

37
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:21,000
Or maybe now we have yet another series of confusing brand names where DEX does not mean

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,720
what we all think DEX means.

39
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
What do you think, Joe?

40
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,680
Well, yeah, this is all because of Chrome OS, isn't it?

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,400
And the fact that they've added Android app support into that.

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,320
And therefore, people are making these Android apps in a way that actually works in a windowed

43
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,840
environment rather than just full screen touch.

44
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,200
So I'm inclined to agree that they just don't really need to run proper Linux anymore.

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,440
But they were kind of targeting developers, weren't they?

46
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
I don't know.

47
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,120
I haven't heard any more about that.

48
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,040
Maybe they've quietly dropped it or maybe they're just working on it simultaneously.

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
That's what I suspect.

50
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,400
And that's why I think it's kind of confusing is I think you're going to have DEX, which

51
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,640
is a windowed Android environment, and you're going to have the DEX dock, which is a docking

52
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,180
station that gives you access to a Linux development environment that co-runs on the phone.

53
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,160
It's very confusing.

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,020
And they maybe are for different markets.

55
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,520
The one on the tablet's more for just regular end users that might be considering a laptop

56
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,400
where this sort of solves all that.

57
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:23,800
Because the price of the Tab S4 is going to be 650 US greenbacks for the Wi-Fi version.

58
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,920
And that's going to be starting August 10th.

59
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,680
They will also be offering an LTE version, but it's more expensive, it's carrier limited,

60
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
those kinds of things.

61
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,860
So you think about somebody who's maybe going for the budget purchase here instead of buying

62
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:43,520
a full-fledged Windows 10 laptop, they go for a Galaxy Tab S4 running Android that now

63
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,120
supports windowed applications.

64
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,900
That might be the market.

65
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,900
It's confusing.

66
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,300
And I am disappointed that it's not full Linux, but I think I can see the market they're shooting

67
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,300
for here.

68
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,180
I don't know why that market wouldn't just buy Chromebooks, but I get the logic of it.

69
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,160
It seems that they're trying to compete with the Surface and the iPad, really.

70
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,760
And they have to have some skin in that game, even if it's not going to be massively successful

71
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
for them.

72
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,080
They have to at least have a go.

73
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,240
But you have to ask yourself, how many times are we going to see companies attempt to put

74
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,360
a desktop UI on top of Android and have it not sell very well?

75
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,680
We'll watch them do it right up until the release of Fuchsia.

76
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,240
Yeah, pretty much.

77
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,480
Well, while we're talking about embedded devices, on the other end is all of those home routers.

78
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,740
And our favorite project to make those just a little bit better is OpenWRT.

79
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,840
And they've got a new release, which is a major milestone.

80
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,240
8.06 has come out.

81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,480
And this is the first release since they merged back with LEAD or LEDE.

82
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,640
And it's been a year in the making.

83
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,300
And there is definitely some results of that year of work.

84
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,880
So depending on your architecture, you're either going to get kernel 4.9 or 4.14, which

85
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,520
is pretty recent.

86
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,400
There's also been nice improvements to the system upgrade procedures and a new auto rollback

87
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,680
functionality to revert the configuration changes when access to the router is lost.

88
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,600
As well, of course, a bunch of other features, security improvements, and WireGuard VPN optimizations.

89
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,880
And WireGuard's something that might well be in the kernel pretty soon.

90
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
I hope so.

91
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,160
WireGuard is some good tech.

92
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,380
If you're not familiar, it's a secure network tunnel written from the ground up for Linux.

93
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,400
It's been around for three years of serious development.

94
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,760
It's in deployment at large corporations.

95
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,060
And it's been designed with the primary goal of being both easy to audit by virtue of being

96
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,440
small and highly secure from a cryptography systems and security perspective.

97
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,120
Yeah, it's been an out of tree module for quite a while.

98
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,720
And it's been pretty widely deployed in data centers and whatnot.

99
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
So it's no surprise really that this is happening.

100
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,720
But it is definitely good news.

101
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
Yeah.

102
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,440
You know, as the very nature of being an out of tree module, it had its own Git repo and

103
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,440
its own mailing list.

104
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,200
So you could really specifically watch the development of WireGuard for a while.

105
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:06,200
And they've been testing the WireGuard module against every stable Linux kernel since 3.10

106
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,080
on a variety of architectures.

107
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,380
So this is about as baked as it gets before something goes in the kernel.

108
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,080
And that might be why Linus seems to love it so much.

109
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,720
She says on an unrelated note, I see Jason actually made the pull request to have WireGuard

110
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,840
included in the kernel.

111
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,200
And then Linus goes on to say, can I just once again state my love for it and I hope

112
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,220
it gets merged soon?

113
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,880
Maybe the code is imperfect, but I've skimmed it and compared to the horrors that are open

114
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,780
VPN and IPSec.

115
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,780
And it's a work of art.

116
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,080
Yeah, glowing praise from Linus there.

117
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,880
But I didn't think open VPN was that bad.

118
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,520
It's the kind of go to for a lot of people.

119
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,200
You've got to think about it, though, from the kernel perspective.

120
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,080
These are guys that are writing the Linux kernel.

121
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,200
And WireGuard has been created specifically for Linux's kernel, Linux's networking stack

122
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,400
and all of that.

123
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,520
And so open VPN and IPSec, while great, are not purpose built for Linux.

124
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,040
They're a general purpose technology.

125
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,400
They work on the BSDs, they work on the Windows, they work on the Macs.

126
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,880
And so it's not like custom engineered for all of the particulars of Linux's kernel.

127
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,080
And I think when you look at it from that perspective, they just think this is a work

128
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,960
of art because it beautifully plugs in with all the stuff they've been building for years.

129
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,680
And another great thing about WireGuard is the code's been audited by a couple of academic

130
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,280
institutions and those audits are being verified at the moment.

131
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,440
So we pretty much know that it is rock solid.

132
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Last.ting.com.

133
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,960
Ting is smarter than unlimited wireless because if you just use less, you pay less.

134
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,000
The average Ting bill is $23 per phone per month.

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,760
It's pay for what you use, a fair price for however much you talk, text and data you use.

136
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:50,480
But perhaps my favorite part, no contracts nor the termination fees, no quote unquote

137
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,580
service agreements.

138
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,840
And they've got nationwide coverage.

139
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,040
Rest assured, they've got you covered with coast to coast CDMA and GSM coverage.

140
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,180
So whatever better in your area or whatever device that you might have, which also means

141
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,360
if you bring a device to Ting, CDMA or GSM, they'll give you $25 in service credit instead

142
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,280
of taking it off a phone.

143
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,520
And it'll probably pay for more than your first month.

144
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,780
They got a bunch of great devices.

145
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,560
They have a great control panel to manage your wireless account.

146
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,520
I've been using Ting for over four years.

147
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:24,840
I've also got two Ting Mifis that I have sitting in my RV ready to go whenever we hit the road.

148
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,640
It's $6 a month for each plus Uncle Sam's cut.

149
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,040
It's not a big deal to have that as an available option and then I get two networks worth of

150
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
coverage.

151
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,520
It's a super great way to do wireless.

152
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,560
It's smarter than unlimited.

153
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,800
If you use less, you pay less.

154
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,320
Lass.ting.com.

155
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,800
It's been a pretty good week for FOSS projects in terms of donations.

156
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,040
Let's start with elementary OS, they've had a large anonymous donation and that has allowed

157
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,900
Cassidy to go full time with the project joining Daniel there.

158
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,960
So now they've got two full time staffers.

159
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,040
That's got to be good news for them.

160
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,360
Yeah, and Cassidy comes from System76 where I believe he's worked since 2014.

161
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,300
In 2017, he was officially promoted to the UX architect for System76 hardware, software

162
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,660
and tools, and of course, everyone's favorite, Pop OS.

163
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,940
This is a big move and congratulations to Cassidy and he says, the continued support

164
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,360
for our community as well as a large private contribution has given me the opportunity

165
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,520
to go full time and do this as my career.

166
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,560
Now, here's the key part I took away from his blog post, which we'll have linked in

167
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
the show notes.

168
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,200
I plan to continue to focus on the areas I've been working on as a volunteer plus dedicate

169
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,240
time to working with OEMs, app developers, and other parties to help keep elementary

170
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,920
financially sustainable.

171
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,880
So there's a lot in this paragraph, so I want to pull out a couple of details.

172
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,360
Let's start with the last one.

173
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,120
Keep elementary financially sustainable.

174
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,080
This is right now at least a one time donation.

175
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:57,160
So this will give Cassidy about a year's runway, but they will have to come up with other ways

176
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,400
to fund that work after this year.

177
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,880
So that's the financially sustainable part there, and I think that's interesting.

178
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,440
But then this other line in here, dedicate time to working with OEMs.

179
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:13,020
Well, now that's interesting considering that Cassidy had been at System76 since 2014.

180
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:18,300
He may have a very good perspective on how to work with OEMs and how a distribution can

181
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,520
work with OEMs.

182
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,440
There's also a bit of talk at the end of this post about continuing their relationship with

183
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,060
System76 just from the other side now.

184
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:31,960
You take these two elements together, I'm just saying Cassidy could be like an OEM ninja

185
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,320
for elementary OS here and could create some great deals and have really good insights

186
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,640
into how these companies actually function.

187
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,360
Well let's hope so because we've seen a fair few smaller projects struggling financially

188
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,480
lately and there are definitely OEMs out there looking to put destroyers like elementary

189
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,600
on hardware because they've proven to sell pretty well.

190
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,740
Really the name of the week though is handshake.org.

191
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,760
They're a decentralized certificate authority and a peer-to-peer DNS service.

192
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,120
The Gnome Foundation has received $400,000 from them as well as Apache, the EFF and other

193
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,240
projects have received some funds.

194
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,760
And the way the money breaks down for Gnome is $300,000 goes to the project and $100,000

195
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
goes to GIMP.

196
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,800
That is massive given there are so few people working on GIMP that's going to be a lot of

197
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,080
money for them.

198
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,320
But what do you make of handshake.org then?

199
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,760
Is this revolutionary or is it just yet another sort of ICO based scam?

200
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,160
I don't know if a scam is the right way to put it, maybe an ICO hopeful.

201
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,440
I mean handshake at least in theory is a great idea, decentralized, permissionless, naming

202
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,020
protocol that's compatible with DNS where every peer is validating and in charge of

203
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:48,200
managing the root zone with the goal of creating alternatives to existing certificate authorities.

204
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,440
I can tell you that's something the internet desperately needs.

205
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,680
And they're really not trying to replace DNS but to replace the root zone file and the

206
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,260
root servers with this handshake system.

207
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,620
And I think that's a pretty clever idea, I don't know if it's possible but it's clever.

208
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,520
This sounds like ideal TechSnap material to me, maybe you and Wes could go into this in

209
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
a bit more depth.

210
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,520
Hmm, perhaps.

211
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,760
Well, let's keep the decentralized train running here because Mozilla would like us all to

212
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
talk about the D-Web.

213
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,440
Yeah, the decentralized or distributed web and this is a post on the hacks.mozilla.org

214
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,600
blog and it's a little bit light on content, it's more kind of queuing up what they're

215
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,360
going to be talking about in a series of blog posts.

216
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:33,520
But it really does raise a lot of the issues that centralization have caused and hopefully

217
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:39,160
this is going to offer some solutions to that, kind of spotlighting various projects that

218
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,440
are aiming to avoid this centralization problem.

219
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,280
And they're going for the hard kind of centralization, I mean social networking and that kind of

220
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:51,880
stuff is going to be in this series it sounds like but they also want to try going after

221
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:58,080
things like the DNS system and also certificate authorities, try to decentralize those aspects

222
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,080
of the web.

223
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:03,120
So they say in a series of posts they'll introduce projects that cover social communication,

224
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,140
online identity, file sharing, new economic models as well as high level application platforms.

225
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,680
All of this work will either be decentralized or distributed, minimizing or entirely removing

226
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,000
central control.

227
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,120
Now the whole post has more including diagrams about the differences between centralized,

228
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,060
decentralized and distributed so you might want to give it a read if this is an area

229
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,840
that kind of gets you excited, linuxactionnews.com slash 65.

230
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:34,500
But it's not the only thing that Mozilla have been up to this week, they've also announced

231
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:40,400
evolving the Firefox brand and talking about how they've got two possibilities for the

232
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,160
visual branding of Firefox and they're not asking people to vote, they're kind of asking

233
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,520
for opinions but they're saying that's not necessarily going to influence their decisions

234
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,840
and they're two quite distinct visual styles and I must say I prefer the second one.

235
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,760
I thought you might, yeah it's much more traditional and I kind of like the first one, they call

236
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,840
them system one and system two and I kind of just like if you're going to change it,

237
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,820
go for something bold but the origins of this whole redesign makes it sound like there may

238
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,640
be some cool projects in the Mozilla Skunkwork labs.

239
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:19,720
They say a team made up of product and brand designers at Mozilla have begun imagining

240
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:27,200
a new system to embrace all the Firefox products in the pipeline and those still in the minds

241
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,880
of our emerging technologies group, aka the Skunkworks.

242
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,560
If they want to be modern and hip, they have to kind of design these things and I hate

243
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,360
saying this Joe but it's true with the app icon in mind, what's the icon look on the

244
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,880
phone and the system one design I think is much more distinctive.

245
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,660
Is it distinctive or does it look just like GitLab?

246
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:49,800
Now I can't unsee that.

247
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,320
I saw them side by side and it was unbelievable how close they were, you think they would

248
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
have noticed that.

249
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,240
Dang it Joe, dang it.

250
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,340
Well okay let's talk about the tech side of Firefox for a bit because version 63 is going

251
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,040
to have a great new feature for Linux users.

252
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,720
It will use a bit more RAM though.

253
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,200
Yeah out of process extensions which were available on the other platforms, Windows

254
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:16,280
and Mac, are finally coming to Linux as the kind of second class citizen but well at least

255
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
we're getting them now.

256
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,480
Yeah and this is really the fruits of a process that began three years ago with the move to

257
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,440
web extensions and that's what's making this possible.

258
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,040
The only type of extensions that will be supported by Firefox 63 is web extensions.

259
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,640
The addition of another running process will also increase your memory but the way this

260
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,500
is going to work is these extensions will be out of the main Firefox process and onto

261
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,500
their own.

262
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,000
So if they have some shenanigans, if they have a crash, they do not affect your main

263
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,560
browser thread.

264
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,640
It's similar to why Chrome uses so much memory but Firefox thinks they may have done it a

265
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,240
little more clever and a little slimmer.

266
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,880
Well you mentioned the extra RAM usage and you do have to wonder is this going to mean

267
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,280
extra CPU overhead as well and just generally performance might suffer a little bit but

268
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,720
then performance versus stability, I'm always going to pick stability.

269
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,560
I agree that web browsers become such an essential part of my daily work that making it more

270
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,960
stable is the first priority.

271
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,340
Performance though is much appreciated and that might be where we get long term.

272
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,320
If you think about it, you're kind of getting Firefox down to a core now and that makes

273
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,200
it much easier to improve security and stability over the long term and this work really goes

274
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,560
all the way back to Firefox 49.

275
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,600
It has taken a while for us Linux users to get this but this has been something that

276
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,220
has been done right, it's been well engineered and it's a long term work that isn't even

277
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,400
necessarily done with this stage but this might be one of the most significant stages

278
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,680
of this work.

279
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,200
Well we'll be following that process over the next weeks and months and years and you
