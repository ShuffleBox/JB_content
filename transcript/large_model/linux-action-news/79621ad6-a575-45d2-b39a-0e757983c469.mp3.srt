00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,100
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,200
This is episode 80, recorded on November 18th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,200
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,200
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,200
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,200
It's good to be connected with you.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,120
We have a bunch of news today.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,480
Let's start it off with the new Raspberry Pi.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,680
Maybe it's not the one you were expecting, but it may be one you end up wanting.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,320
Yeah, the Raspberry Pi 3 Model A Plus.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,460
It's a bit of a mouthful.

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:46,320
And it's essentially just a cut down version of the 3B Plus, except that it's smaller,

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,020
it doesn't have as many USB ports, and it's got half the amount of RAM.

14
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,020
And it's cheaper.

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,020
Right.

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:58,060
It comes in at 25 US greenbacks, and it is a little strange to have a brand new model

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,760
that has slightly less specs, but it's perfectly formed, as they say.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,960
It's really a great size.

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,500
It's almost just a square size with a much denser sort of form factor.

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,780
And you could sort of say it might be the most eloquent Raspberry Pi.

21
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:20,720
In fact, in a way, it's sort of their goodbye to this entire architecture.

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,600
It's their one last hurrah.

23
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,980
And at $25, it's not bad.

24
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:34,040
It's at 1.4 gigahertz, 64-bit quad-core ARM Cortex A53 CPU, has 512 megabytes of LPDDR2

25
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:42,240
RAM, it has a dual band 802.11 AC wireless LAN, and it also has Bluetooth 4.2 BLE.

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,520
Supposedly, they say they've improved the mass storage booting and the thermal management

27
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,520
as well.

28
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,480
Don't have any hands on with that yet, but that would also be a welcome addition to this

29
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
unit.

30
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,080
That really was pretty great.

31
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,760
And if this is their goodbye to this architecture, if this is sort of the last hurrah, I think

32
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
this is a pretty good one.

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
And they convinced me.

34
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,760
I ordered one this morning.

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,240
For me, though, this is more about embedding it in projects.

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,800
Because if anything, we want more RAM, don't we, rather than less?

37
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,280
Only 512.

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,120
That's really not much to do any sort of desktop or media center type work.

39
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:23,040
Really, this is for putting in headless projects, camera stuff, things that need a bit more

40
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,800
CPU for a bit of image processing, maybe, but don't necessarily need all the RAM.

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,840
And don't need all the ports, because it's just going to be sitting, doing a time-lapse

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,040
or something like that.

43
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,800
So I don't see what you're going to use it for if you've already got a 3B.

44
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,200
I actually have a couple of ideas, a couple of projects.

45
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Both of them would be quasi-embedded.

46
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,840
So one of them is kind of like a Christmas gift package idea I have with the kids to

47
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,040
build a little Raspberry Pi computer to play retro games.

48
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,400
They've been really getting into retro Nintendo games, and they don't have a great way to

49
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,680
play them right now.

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,000
So I've ordered a couple of cool retro Super Nintendo controllers, USB controllers, and

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,080
put this together in a little case hooked up to a TV screen.

52
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,860
And they just helped me assemble it all.

53
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,080
And I did some research into the ROM community, and people think 512 megs of RAM is still

54
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,700
going to be plenty for what I'm trying to do.

55
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,380
So it looks like it's got enough headroom there.

56
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:27,160
The second use case is more of a home assistant bridging of some automation systems so I can

57
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,720
have local LAN control without internet connection and work with some of these proprietary devices

58
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,160
and services.

59
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:37,240
And I don't think I need a lot of headroom there, but that's going to be the most tricky

60
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,280
because it's a pretty beefy app, and it's going to need a full Linux subsystem underneath

61
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
it.

62
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,000
So that's going to be the biggest edge case, but that's what I want to test.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,760
How far can I get when they build a model for $25 and its biggest limitation is 512

64
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
megabytes of RAM?

65
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,780
I like this form factor better.

66
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,840
This looks like a more refined device, and I'm curious how far I can push it.

67
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,640
I feel like I'm up for the challenge.

68
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,300
Okay, fair enough.

69
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,480
It sits between the Zero and the Zero W. I mean, I don't think anyone would get a Zero

70
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,900
at this point because it doesn't have the Wi-Fi on it.

71
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:18,280
So it kind of sits between that $10-ish Zero W and then the $35 3B+.

72
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,280
So I think you have to have a specific implementation in mind, really, to not spend that extra $10

73
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,720
for the $35 one.

74
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,200
That's what I would do because why not just have twice the RAM?

75
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,840
Or you're trying to reach a certain scale.

76
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,560
Maybe you're doing like a large educational program and you're buying 5,000 of them at

77
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,720
a time, something like that.

78
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
Oh, yeah.

79
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,760
Yeah, that kind of makes sense, yeah.

80
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,540
One of the other reasons I bought this sucker was because this is a platform.

81
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,240
These Raspberry Pis, or maybe not even the best deal, they're not the most performant

82
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,760
devices, but they are a standard.

83
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,120
And I know that there are projects out there today that exist already that I can just throw

84
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,720
on these things and they're ready to go and I can have this thing live in the corner of

85
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,680
the studio and it'll just plug away forever.

86
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,520
These next generation of devices that they kind of hint at here, they talk about them

87
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,080
being a different architecture, a different breed of device.

88
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,360
I mean, maybe we'll call it Raspberry Pi 4, but it's not going to be the Raspberry Pi

89
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,960
that we all know.

90
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,840
And that was another compelling reason for me to buy this one because it's going to be

91
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,080
supported for years by all these open source projects.

92
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:25,000
The implications of a new architecture do have me thinking what I'd really like to see

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,360
in a future Raspberry Pi because these are a platform and buying the Raspberry Pi has

94
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,360
a whole other lot of implications.

95
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,920
There's an accessory ecosystem, there's a lot of educational opportunities, open source

96
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,920
projects.

97
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,400
But it matters that the Raspberry Pi have a wide range of product categories, I think.

98
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,500
And I would love to see maybe a $55 Raspberry Pi or a $75 Raspberry Pi.

99
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,340
What could we do with that?

100
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:54,080
Keep the $25 and the $10 around forever as well.

101
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,840
But what if we opened up this range when we go to this new architecture?

102
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,920
What kind of things with Linux built in could we start seeing if we had even more power

103
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,560
in what has become a common platform?

104
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,120
I think that you're dreaming there, unfortunately.

105
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,960
When I spoke to Eben about this, when the Raspberry Pi 3 came out, not the Plus, but

106
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,040
the original 3, I talked to him about that only having one gigabyte of RAM and trying

107
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,600
to up that to two and up the specs and everything.

108
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,720
And he said that they are determined to keep it at $35 and cap it at that.

109
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,640
And so that then becomes a limiting factor.

110
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,460
Because this Broadcom chipset that they're using only supports up to a gigabyte of RAM,

111
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,360
that means that they would have to change the complete innards of this thing.

112
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
Maybe they will.

113
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,520
Maybe that's what some of this implications of the new architecture are.

114
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,780
But I follow what your meaning is.

115
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,860
This is their goal is the pricing is paramount.

116
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,160
That's one of their biggest priorities when they're building this thing is keeping it

117
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,440
at that low price point.

118
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,960
And I say fair enough.

119
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,960
That's been good for them and that's good for people that want to get into these things

120
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
at a low price.

121
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,400
So who am I to say that they should build a more expensive one?

122
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,440
There's plenty of alternatives out there, like I said earlier.

123
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
Well, yeah, there's tons.

124
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,320
And a lot of them have Pi in the name to try and cash in on it.

125
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,280
But yeah, really, you're looking at possibly a slightly faster system on a chip with maybe

126
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,000
two gigabytes of RAM.

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,640
But this idea of having USB 3.0 and proper gigabit Ethernet and everything, I think people

128
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,400
are dreaming there for $35.

129
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,580
It's going to be at least another couple of generations before the other components come

130
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,720
down low enough to enable them to do that.

131
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,480
Because $35 is not a lot of money, is it?

132
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
No.

133
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,800
And these things get a lot of value for that $35.

134
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,740
Many of them are running Raspbian, which just received a new update this week.

135
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,120
And in that update is a hardware accelerated VLC.

136
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,920
Now not for everything, but for certain types of media playback, they're actually getting

137
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:55,400
hardware acceleration out of these things for H.264, MPEG2, and VC1 video.

138
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,840
Didn't get a chance to try this, Joe, but have you given this a go yet?

139
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,320
I did, yeah, and I was really surprised at how well it worked.

140
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:07,680
Even on the Xero, standard definition playback worked well.

141
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,560
Full screen, okay, it was a little bit hit and miss with a few drop frames here and there.

142
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,280
It was kind of bearable, but I don't think you would really want to watch much video,

143
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,200
maybe like for a presentation or something or a super low bit rate and low resolution

144
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,400
you might get away with.

145
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:35,240
But on my three, which is the original three, not the plus, that was not a problem at all.

146
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,880
Standard def video works flawlessly on it.

147
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,920
I tried 1080p, and I don't know if it was the bottleneck of the network streaming from

148
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,760
my NAS, but it was a little bit hit and miss there.

149
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,440
But 720p full screen, no problem.

150
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,840
So it is massively, massively improved over the previous version of Raspbian and VLC where

151
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,680
there was no hardware acceleration there.

152
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,920
It was just even not full screen.

153
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,200
Standard definition was choppy.

154
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,960
Hmm, you know, that's got some serious potentials when you start hooking these things up to

155
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,940
TVs, put Kodi on there, swap out the player for VLC, and I've got hardware accelerated

156
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,940
Kodi playback.

157
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:16,200
You're just an app get update, app get dist upgrade away if you want to get the latest

158
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Raspbian.

159
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,320
And then, of course, just install VLC and you'll have that hardware accelerated version.

160
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,440
They worked pretty hard on that.

161
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,920
There's a bunch of other great updates in there as well.

162
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,420
But I wanted to also go to another use case for Raspberry Pis that I think are pretty

163
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,240
neat and touch on that whole, they're a bit of a platform thing.

164
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,280
Kodak is going to sell like a high end 3D printer with a Raspberry Pi built in.

165
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,540
Yeah, and high end, you're not joking there, three and a half thousand dollars.

166
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,480
So this thing, you think that the controller for it would be a bit more powerful than the

167
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,280
Raspberry Pi if you're paying that much, but I suppose it doesn't need to do that much.

168
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:59,420
And it goes to show, yeah, as a platform, it's such a popular device and they can make

169
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,160
them at such scale, it's ideal for something like this.

170
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,880
If this was our perennial show, I'd be saying this is my runs Linux this week because it's

171
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,000
a pretty slick looking unit.

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,800
I mean, this is now 3D printers for the mainstream and they're targeting engineering, education

173
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,420
and actual business workloads.

174
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,180
But the Linux part of this thing is used for the touch screen, for sucking in files, but

175
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,720
also for integrating with their cloud service where you can manage printing amongst multiple

176
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,240
units, which is kind of a neat thing.

177
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,760
I never thought about orchestration for 3D printers before, but I could actually see

178
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,800
that being a thing and I want to be whoever that is that's having that problem because

179
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,800
that's great.

180
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,560
Well, they are pretty slow, aren't they?

181
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,840
So it makes sense to do one bit in each one at the same time rather than having to wait

182
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
around.

183
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,380
Yeah, and the thing's got Wi-Fi or Ethernet, plus it's got a camera in the printing chamber

184
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,320
so you can check on it from wherever you're at, and that's also being facilitated by the

185
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,440
Raspberry Pi.

186
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,920
They have a nickname, I'm going to call it, for their version of Linux on there.

187
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,280
They call it 3D Printer OS, which is, you know, it's a Kodak recipe on top of a Linux

188
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,820
kernel basically.

189
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,880
It's just great to see these Raspberry Pis be put into production because when they first

190
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,640
came out, like, oh, they're a toy.

191
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,280
You can't really use them for real products and now you have Kodak 3D printer shipping

192
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
with them.

193
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,440
Well, speaking of toys, I put this next story in just because I wanted an excuse to laugh

194
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,680
at folding phones.

195
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
Yeah, good.

196
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,680
Good, okay.

197
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,840
I'm on board.

198
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,560
This is actually also revealing something about Android I wasn't aware of before.

199
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,400
So this is really at the core of it.

200
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,940
It's about updating Android's multi-resume functionality.

201
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,760
You know, when you've got, like, an Android device that has a big enough screen where

202
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,520
you can split screen it and run two apps at once, well, whatever app isn't active gets

203
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
put to sleep.

204
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,840
I didn't realize that limitation of Android because I've never used that feature, but

205
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
that's really lame.

206
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,600
Yeah, I can't say I've ever noticed it either because I have tested out that feature briefly,

207
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,320
but then I've just thought, this is pointless.

208
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,460
Why am I doing this, certainly on a phone?

209
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:11,320
But it matters on a split screen foldable phone because you'll have apps on sides that

210
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,120
are folded and they'll have to be put to sleep and the multi-resume feature now makes it

211
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,500
possible for multiple apps to be open and actually be running at the same time.

212
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,540
It's kind of weird how Google's rolling this out.

213
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:28,960
It's going to be baked into Android Q, but OEMs can opt into a special beta branch of

214
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,680
Android P and get it pretty soon in Android P as well if they have to rush to market with

215
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,200
a foldable device right now.

216
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,520
Yeah, this must be Samsung who've been working with Google here because they are the ones

217
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:47,200
who are pushing to sell this foldable phone in, I think, Q1 next year or certainly early

218
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Q2.

219
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,640
If not, I mean, it just looks a bit ridiculous though, doesn't it?

220
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Oh my gosh.

221
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,480
The only kind of foldable phone that I would be interested in would be like an actual flip

222
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
phone.

223
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,480
Yeah.

224
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,680
That maybe you flip it up and it's two screens inside and you could hang it up and you could

225
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,920
like a flip phone from the 90s.

226
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
That would be fine.

227
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,880
I'd be curious to give that a go, but I don't need to fold the glass itself.

228
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,880
I don't get it.

229
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,200
The prototypes look pretty bad.

230
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,640
It's more like a wedge.

231
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,020
Folding isn't really what you're doing.

232
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,040
It's more like a really sharp bend.

233
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,320
They're bending them.

234
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
Yeah.

235
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,600
And we all remember Bendgate with the iPhones.

236
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,720
I'd be reluctant even if it was designed to fold.

237
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,280
I saw someone do a video of folding an iPad Pro.

238
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Snap.

239
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
You know, just bending it.

240
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,800
It just shatters and oh, it's just painful to watch.

241
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Yeah.

242
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,280
Well, you got Bendgate and of course you got Donglegate and Android phones are no longer

243
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,200
free from Donglegate either.

244
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:50,900
Essential has shown a few signs of life with their new magnetic headphone jack adapter.

245
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,360
It's pretty looking, but it comes at a price.

246
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Yeah.

247
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,200
A price of $150 or $149.

248
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,280
To get a headphone jack.

249
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,120
Which to be fair, that's not quite true.

250
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,040
It is a very, very good digital to analog converter.

251
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Yeah.

252
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
It actually seems like it checks out.

253
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,840
I was reading some details on their website and it's audiophile grade as they put it,

254
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,460
but with some legitimate details behind that.

255
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,080
And they've done a design where you could put bigger audiophile headphones into this

256
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,480
jack and they'll actually snap in.

257
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,940
And the thing's neat, right?

258
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,960
It magnetically pops right on and it gives you a great DAC and you can listen to it while

259
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,080
your phone's in a dock.

260
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,360
And you could see how somebody who has the money to blow on an essential phone might

261
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,760
want to blow $150 to get a headphone jack, I guess.

262
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,320
But that price, you literally could buy the market's highest end Bluetooth wireless headphones

263
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,160
or something that sound fairly decent.

264
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,080
I guess they're not audiophile grade though.

265
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,300
Yeah, even the best Bluetooth is going to come nowhere near a proper wired, decent digital

266
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,300
to analog converter.

267
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:58,600
So I can see a market for this and it's only really interesting because we thought that

268
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,680
essential were pretty much circling the drain and maybe this is their death rattle.

269
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,680
I don't know.

270
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,680
They kind of must've been working on this for a while and thought, well, at least we'll

271
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,480
get this out and try and get some revenue in, but I can't see it doing well.

272
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,240
It's not going to drive a lot of revenue because it's a niche accessory for a niche Android

273
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
phone.

274
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,260
There's not a huge essential market out there.

275
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,160
And then there's going to be even fewer of them that want to spend that money on a headphone

276
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,160
jack that only works with this phone, where something like regular Bluetooth headphones,

277
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,040
again, not great audio quality, but would work with any phone they buy in the future.

278
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,980
This is bad too, because this was first announced in June and then they said it'd be shipping

279
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,040
in the summer, but that obviously came and went.

280
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,920
And now here we are in November and it's available.

281
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:51,400
That's rough for a pretty basic accessory that that was supposed to be one of the cornerstone

282
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,720
features of this phone was the snap on accessories and this is what we've gotten so far.

283
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,960
And it's only really news because of the hype that surrounded the essential phone in the

284
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,080
first place, because Andy Rubin, one of the founders of Android in the first place, had

285
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,520
left Google to do this new thing and everyone thought it was going to be great and they

286
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,520
made all these promises and it's just failed to deliver, hasn't it?

287
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,560
They've sold very few of these phones and the accessories that they promised, that always

288
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,800
goes that way, doesn't it?

289
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,600
Like Motorola have done that before.

290
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,900
You launch a phone with these ports on it or whatever that you'll be able to put these

291
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,960
proprietary accessories on and there's going to be tons of them coming in a few months

292
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,640
and then they just never really deliver on that.

293
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,120
Red's doing it right now with their camera, which I had a chance to use in the, in a,

294
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
in a store.

295
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,720
Oh man, that thing's huge.

296
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
It's a big phone.

297
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,120
With this like 3D, the 3DS style 3D on it, that looks horrible as well.

298
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
Yes, exactly.

299
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,000
If you've ever seen a 3DS, it's a lot like that, maybe slightly better and obviously

300
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,120
higher resolution, but about that.

301
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,960
Yeah, but that's a proper gimmick as well.

302
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,520
You'd think with Red, the camera would be amazing because they're a camera company,

303
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,760
but apparently it's just not that good.

304
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,760
It's a standard part.

305
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,200
Yeah, they might later on have a module that you can snap on, but in the meantime, people

306
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,320
are getting real work done.

307
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,600
Like the folks over at Canonical, Mark Shuttleworth made some headlines this week when he announced

308
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,960
that Ubuntu 18.04 would get a 10 year support lifespan.

309
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,960
Yeah, this was at his keynote at the OpenStack Summit in Berlin and he just kind of casually

310
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,520
tossed it in there, didn't he?

311
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,920
Yeah, it's going to be supported for 10 years.

312
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,160
Yeah, we both watched it and it was just one of the bullet items that he was going through.

313
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,200
That's just something we're going to do.

314
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,880
And that might be because of the market he's now really competing in.

315
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,080
That's sort of the standard.

316
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,720
Windows has a very long support lifecycle.

317
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,760
Red Hat Enterprise Linux has a very long support cycle.

318
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,040
And my understanding is that this isn't necessarily available to just anybody.

319
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,680
Yeah, that was one of the big questions that I saw a lot of people asking.

320
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:54,240
Of course, with an LTS, you get five years with Ubuntu for free.

321
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,800
But this extra five years, is that going to be free or is it going to be paid for as part

322
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
of their ESM program?

323
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:07,480
Well, I asked someone who was with Shuttleworth in Berlin and he told me that having spoken

324
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,280
to Mark, it's going to be part of that ESM.

325
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,920
So unfortunately, you're going to have to pay for it.

326
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,880
And there is like a minimum to get into that program, like a minimum $2,500.

327
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,000
You have to have a certain amount of rigs and whatnot.

328
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,520
But that's not a very big barrier to entry to any organization that's running a fleet

329
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
of these machines.

330
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,040
And to get an additional five years means that people that are working on products right

331
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:35,060
now in 2018, when they ship them in 2019 and 2020, they're going to be safe basing them

332
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,720
on 1804 right now.

333
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,120
And that's who he's speaking to.

334
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,560
He's speaking to the telcos.

335
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,160
He specifically called out the financial institutions and IoT as well.

336
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,360
Yeah, don't think desktop here, think VMs, cloud, OpenStack, that sort of thing.

337
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Yeah.

338
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,040
Really, that's where most of Canonical's revenue comes from.

339
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,280
And those corporate users utilize that extended support.

340
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:02,040
There's also an extended support program currently for 1204 and 1404.

341
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,880
And there was implication by Mark Shuttleworth at this event that when the next LTS is released

342
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,400
by Canonical, it may just launch with that longer support lifespan.

343
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Yeah.

344
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,840
And all of this, as you mentioned, is about competing with Red Hat, essentially, isn't

345
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,840
it?

346
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,640
Because with RHEL, you can get 10 years.

347
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,120
And they're competing in a very clever way.

348
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,740
This is when you watch Mark up on stage, you really get a sense that he has a keen understanding

349
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,560
of this market because of certain words and key phrases and focuses that he has are speaking

350
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,280
to a very specific customer.

351
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,360
And that's sort of that CIO, CTO level business person.

352
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,880
That's who Mark's really addressing.

353
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,800
And in an interview on ZDNet, he said, we are neutral on the public cloud.

354
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,320
We work at arm's length with AWS, Azure, and Google.

355
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,700
We provide a common currency across different environments.

356
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,020
But we are not the lowest common denominator.

357
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:02,600
We want to be the best operating system on Azure for Azure and AWS for AWS, and so on.

358
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,600
So what he's saying there, that's business speak for we don't just have one agreement

359
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,120
with one company and we optimize our OS for that.

360
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,220
We optimize it for each public cloud because we're neutral.

361
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,160
We are a common platform.

362
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,900
And that is exactly why IBM is buying Red Hat, because Red Hat is this neutral player

363
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,960
that they can go in and sell to their customers who don't want vendor lock-in.

364
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,200
IBM is trying to save people from vendor lock-in with the Red Hat purchase.

365
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,340
That's a big part of the value is Red Hat is Switzerland.

366
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,800
That's been a big message is the Red Hat's going to remain Switzerland.

367
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,520
And we're going to keep our go-to-market strategies.

368
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,560
That's business speak for what the market wants now as they move more functionality

369
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,160
to the cloud is they don't want to get locked into any particular cloud.

370
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,440
And if you're building the platform that lets them run on multiple different clouds, then

371
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,340
you are in their sights for purchase.

372
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,720
And that's what Mark's talking about.

373
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,480
And now that's what IBM is talking about.

374
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
It's very clever.

375
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Well, yeah.

376
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,560
And of course, being able to orchestrate your services across multiple cloud vendors means

377
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:11,320
that when one of them has an outage, you can just spin up a few extra ones on their competitor

378
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,320
and your service doesn't go down.

379
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,600
I mean, we've seen AWS go down and Azure go down, and half the internet disappears.

380
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,280
It might not be very long, but that's money lost.

381
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
Right.

382
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,680
And with big orchestration systems like Kubernetes and others, it becomes possible to say, we're

383
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,200
going to have a really big weekend.

384
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,520
We need additional infrastructure for this launch weekend, and you can spin up infrastructure

385
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:40,520
on DigitalOcean and on AWS using the same central management tools.

386
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,640
And that means keeping things vendor neutral is much more of a big deal now than it used

387
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,220
to be because you want to have that flexibility.

388
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,760
And so that's why they're speaking to these customers and they're using this language.

389
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,800
And Mark does have an inherent advantage here.

390
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,600
Ubuntu has sort of just taken off in the cloud, and they really have been able to remain vendor

391
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,600
neutral.

392
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:07,480
It doesn't take a ton of overhead to specialize certain spins of the OS for big cloud providers.

393
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:13,720
If it takes a team of a dozen to customize Ubuntu a little bit for AWS, that's an investment

394
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,720
that's well spent.

395
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,960
Well, very much like the investment of this extended support is worth it, if they're bringing

396
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,720
in $2,500 per customer minimum, then it doesn't take many of those customers, does it, to

397
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,760
justify that program and the extra staff that are required for that.

398
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,800
This is my sense, is that a lot of this stuff is making more revenue than people fully realize,

399
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:40,520
and that Canonical is getting leaner and fitter and positioning themselves to be a much bigger

400
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,000
player, or maybe I should say, to attract much bigger players.

401
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Well, yeah.

402
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,440
Shot of Worth is getting serious now.

403
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,280
He's had enough of messing around with things like the phone and everything.

404
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,980
We saw him shut that down and slim down Canonical.

405
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,640
And he's been talking about doing an IPO pretty much ever since then.

406
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:04,160
And part of that is moving to genuine profit, serious figures, serious revenue, serious

407
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,180
profit, serious growth.

408
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:13,320
And he's even now looking for investors as kind of the first stage towards going to an

409
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,320
IPO.

410
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,040
So things must be going pretty well over there.

411
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,960
Obviously, he's going to talk it up.

412
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
That's what you do in business.

413
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,200
But I think finally, they've got their ducks in a row, and they're starting to make some

414
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
serious profit.

415
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
You know, he said in an interview to TechCrunch, the numbers are looking good.

416
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,300
The business is looking healthy.

417
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,300
It's not a charity.

418
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,220
It's not philanthropy.

419
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:36,920
He goes on to say, there are some key metrics that I'm watching, which are the gate for

420
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:42,040
me to take the next step, which would be growth equity, in other words, investment.

421
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,400
And he said later, those metrics are the size of the business and how it's diversified.

422
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,480
But he kind of sums it up as this.

423
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,800
Shot of Worth likens this program of getting the company ready to IPO as to getting it

424
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
fit.

425
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Because there's no point in saying, I haven't done any exercise in the last 10 years, but

426
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,120
I'm going to sign up for tomorrow's marathon.

427
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
It's a good way to put it.

428
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,280
Like, you got to exercise, you got to get fit, you got to get ready for the marathon.

429
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,720
Then you go do the big run.

430
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,560
And I think they're probably getting really close, maybe closer than he implies.

431
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,400
They're just waiting for the right situation.

432
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,000
Well, it's looking increasingly like the IPO will happen in 2019.

433
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,360
So we won't have long to wait.

434
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,360
Yeah.

435
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,200
But in the meantime, the competition isn't sitting still.

436
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,560
Internet Enterprise Linux Beta 8 is out with a couple of nice big features like application

437
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,920
streams, which I believe is essentially modularity from Fedora, and a few other things that are

438
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,920
packed into this thing.

439
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,480
Yeah, it's funny that they're not calling it modularity, they're calling it application

440
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
streams.

441
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,240
But that's the first thing that jumped out at me here was, well, this is just taken straight

442
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,120
from Fedora, which, I mean, Fedora is the upstream for RHEL, so it's to be expected.

443
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
They do that.

444
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,880
Also, another thing that they're going to do that with is Cockpit, apparently.

445
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,760
Cockpit is a brilliant web-based management tool, and I have dealt with some bad ones.

446
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,480
But this one, I gave a review on Linux Unplugged about it a while back, and I like it so much

447
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,280
that I switched my servers over to a giant Fedora installation managed by Cockpit.

448
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,960
And it's great because you can do things through the web interface, and then you can switch

449
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,840
to the command line, and just do stuff on the command line, and it won't break the web

450
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
interface.

451
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
It uses SSH for authentication.

452
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,040
I've just, anyways, I did a whole deep dive on it.

453
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,620
It's a really nice tool that the team over there has built that has been available on

454
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,320
Fedora for a while.

455
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,000
And they're calling it something else, something really plain, like just web console, which

456
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
is so boring.

457
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Cockpit's great.

458
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,120
It's like the control center of your server.

459
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,560
Web console, womp womp.

460
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,840
But they seem to, like, remarket them so that way people that are paying money for Red Hat

461
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,680
feel like they're getting something special rather than something free.

462
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
Yeah, yeah.

463
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,320
They don't want to think, well, hang on, why don't I just use Fedora then?

464
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,240
But it does go to show how much has changed in the last few years since RHEL 7 came out,

465
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,240
doesn't it?

466
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,560
RHEL 8 is looking very different and very modern compared to it.

467
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,880
Yeah, there's a lot of other changes in here, too.

468
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,400
And the Linux Academy crew has been going through this like crazy because, of course,

469
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,980
they're looking at it from, OK, what do we have to update in our courseware?

470
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,560
They have been waiting, like waiting for this announcement, and watching, and watching.

471
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,920
And now they're spinning it up and testing it.

472
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,240
And they're going through it.

473
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,120
And there's way more than what's highlighted in the articles that have come out.

474
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,880
This is a big update.

475
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,420
And it can be downloaded by anyone that's enrolled in the Red Hat developer program

476
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,420
right now.

477
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,640
Or I guess if you want to go sign up and jump through all the hoops, you can get a copy

478
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,200
of it, too, and see what's new.

479
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,640
And it's not going to be a huge surprise to anyone following Fedora.

480
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,760
But it's a neat period of time right now because RHEL 8 is sort of fresh, and new, and current.

481
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,800
And so you can deploy the Red Hat Enterprise desktop and feel like you're running a modern

482
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,680
Linux system for a little while.

483
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,940
It's like the fun period for me for RHEL.

484
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,120
And to watch the crew at Linux Academy scramble to go through it and pull all the different

485
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,160
things out has been interesting to just see an industry respond to a new imminent release

486
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,240
from a perspective I haven't seen before.

487
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,600
It's a big deal when a new RHEL comes out.

488
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,760
It's also a big deal when the entire cryptocurrency market tanks like it did this week.

489
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,380
Oh, bad, too.

490
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,900
We're talking some serious numbers now at this point.

491
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,300
Nearly $30 billion was lost.

492
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:25,000
About 15% of the crypto market share value was lost in the last couple of days.

493
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,580
And as we record this episode, the Bitcoin price is around $5,500.

494
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,580
It's bad right now.

495
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,580
Yeah.

496
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,680
And for the last few months, it's been kind of hovering around about $6,500, but it's

497
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,920
kind of been, well, peaking at $6,500.

498
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:46,200
So that is a significant drop, although it does seem to have stabilized, doesn't it?

499
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,600
It seemed to stabilize very quickly.

500
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,440
I think a lot of people were worried that it was just going to go through the floor.

501
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,440
I'm bullish now.

502
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
I'm bullish.

503
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
We found our floor.

504
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,440
It's $5,500.

505
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,740
Bye.

506
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,740
It's time to go, everybody.

507
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,740
Let's rally up.

508
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,740
Yeah.

509
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,740
This is the sale, as you call it.

510
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,740
Yeah.

511
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,740
That's right.

512
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,740
That's what Bitcoiners call this.

513
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,740
It's on sale right now.

514
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:08,760
And I don't mean to laugh at the loss, because I know as somebody who sometimes has followed

515
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:12,280
this very closely, those price drops can be devastating.

516
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,720
But at the higher level, it's fascinating to watch what happens with an open source

517
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,420
currency, what happens here.

518
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,760
And it may have been the very thing that affects many open source projects that sort of triggered

519
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,340
this entire crash.

520
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:32,680
That's what's fascinating, is a fork of Bitcoin Cash, a hard fork, may have caused this, well,

521
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,220
at least began this process.

522
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,920
And then it's really hard to say.

523
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,860
There's a lot of automated trading that kicks in at certain points.

524
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,840
So it's pretty hard to nail it down to one thing.

525
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,680
But it's a fork, not quite as we know it, but in a similar vein that may have triggered

526
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
this thing.

527
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:54,780
And that's fascinating to me, that it's project politics and money all wrapped up into one

528
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,780
thing.

529
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,780
Yeah, a fork of a fork.

530
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,780
Let's not forget.

531
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,000
So it is a typical open source, isn't it?

532
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yes.

533
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
You're right.

534
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
It is.

535
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,800
We're like for conception now on this.

536
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,900
And in both cases, though, the parent projects that they forked from, I mean, they're not

537
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,820
doing great right now, but they haven't died.

538
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:14,020
They're continuing on.

539
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:18,700
And the weird thing, too, is when a project forks like this, you end up in some cases

540
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,380
holding both kinds of cash all of a sudden.

541
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,740
So you have one of, say, Bitcoin and one of Bitcoin Cash.

542
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:30,780
And then it's a really weird thing that happens, because normally you're out, but in this case,

543
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,780
you sometimes have more.

544
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
Yeah.

545
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,780
Free money.

546
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,780
Sweet.

547
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,980
So all of this internet money, it's really fun to watch.

548
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:44,420
It would be very anxiety-inducing if I had all of my life savings wrapped up into this,

549
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,100
like I know some folks do.

550
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,540
I would not be as jovial about this.

551
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,580
But I spent all of mine, mostly.

552
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,660
So I'm at a point now where I only hold enough that it's not going to make me or break me.

553
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,020
So I can just sort of watch it from a detached, almost scientific perspective.

554
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,020
Yeah.

555
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,820
I put 100 quid into it just for a bit of a laugh.

556
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,620
That's probably worth about 20 quid now, because I bought right at the wrong time.

557
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:12,460
But I don't know, it's got a little way to go to the end of the year to get up to 100,000,

558
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,460
doesn't it?

559
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,460
Well, our predictions may hold true.

560
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,460
I mean, we could work.

561
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,460
It could work out.

562
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,460
We've got a few weeks.

563
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,460
Yeah.

564
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:19,460
Or I could go back and edit in.

565
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:23,700
When we say, yeah, I think it's going to be 100,000, I'll just say, I think it's going

566
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,700
to be 2,000.

567
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,700
Right?

568
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,340
Just totally different cadence, totally different tone.

569
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,340
No one will notice.

570
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,340
We'll be fine.

571
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,860
We don't have to address it in our annual episode.

572
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:38,380

And it's also available to current students.

579

Well, now you can lock in that Black Friday sale price forever.

581
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,900
Very nice.

582
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,460
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

583
