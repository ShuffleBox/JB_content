00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,540
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 200, recorded on August 1st, 2021.

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:09,540
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,540
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,960
Hello, Wes, and 200 episodes sure feels great.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,960
Indeed.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,600
And congratulations to you, to Joe, and to our wonderful audience out there.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,380
Really a big thank you to the audience and to everyone who maybe has been listening since

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:28,320
Linux Action Show, to everybody who just tuned in recently, we're glad to have you aboard

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,140
and to celebrate, we added a new Linux Action News sticker to the jupytergarage.com store.

10
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,780
It was created using our MP3 album art as a template.

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,360
So it just sort of feels like a really nice way to celebrate 200 releases of that album

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,360
art.

13
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,520
There are multiple sizes up and ready to go at jupytergarage.com.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,400
But with that, let's do the news.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,300
Over the years, managing the use of a Linux system's block devices has become more and

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,300
more complicated.

17
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,200
There's several disk tracking methods out there, but nothing really solves the complexity.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,680
The common issue here is users end up using the same device multiple times.

19
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,720
I mean, I know I sure do.

20
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,380
And as it stands now, a program watching for events from a new device can't really tell

21
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,840
whether a particular event is related to the device it just set up.

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,560
Or maybe it could just be an earlier instance with the same name.

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:27,220
There isn't really a straightforward way for all the different components in a Linux system

24
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,840
to track these devices in a consistent way, keep track of them and not step on each other.

25
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,380
On slow and overloaded systems, it's even worse.

26
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,760
It can lead to a race condition if you have a box with really high latency.

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,740
And block devices don't have exclusive owners in user space.

28
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,420
So any process can set one up.

29
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,460
And that sometimes is great.

30
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,180
That's why you can mount a snap as a regular user and don't have to run as root.

31
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,080
But a system wide tracking system that kept track of which device is actually which device

32
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,060
is clearly useful in many ways.

33
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:02,280
And you could really see how it could be useful with something like system D, which could

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,540
really benefit from a system wide numbering scheme to handle events to avoid issues around

35
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,200
device reuse and confusion around that, or even just events arriving to user space out

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,420
of order.

37
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,980
And it looks like work to address this issue might be landing in Linux 5.15.

38
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,180
Along with that support from the system D team that you kind of alluded to there, Chris,

39
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,420
the set of patches that's actually fixing or well, attempting to fix this whole mess,

40
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,100
it was submitted by Microsoft.

41
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:39,180
Their patches would add a bit of order to this whole problem by associating a new, unique,

42
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,100
always increasing sequential number to the lifetime of each block device.

43
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:49,660
Yes, practically speaking, when you add a new block device, like you plug in a USB drive,

44
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,940
or you add a new loopback device, this new disk sequence number is incremented.

45
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,940
It isn't stored permanently.

46
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:01,380
But while your system is up, this disk sequence number list is exported via uevents, sysfs,

47
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,280
and there's even a new I octal interface, meaning it will just plug right in with the

48
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
existing stack.

49
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,100
Yeah, if you're a program trying to add a new device here, once you've done that, you

50
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,140
can immediately then query the system and find out what this new disk sequence number

51
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,140
is.

52
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,060
And then when you're listening for new events happening, you can actually tell just immediately

53
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,620
by looking, oh, does the ID match or not?

54
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,700
You always have that ID to go by now.

55
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,700
Exactly.

56
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,820
And assuming there are no last minute design objections, this code is slated to make it

57
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,100
in as part of a series of pending block subsystem updates queued for 5.15.

58
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,420
There is a lot in the works there in general.

59
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,500
And while we're chatting about 5.15, the new NTFS driver code we covered recently on the

60
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,800
show looks like it is ready to ship in 5.15.

61
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,420
And I know you all just can't wait to format your home partitions in NTFS.

62
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,380
Wait, yours isn't already NTFS?

63
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,380
No, it's not.

64
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, we'll have more coverage when it lands, of course.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,060
But if you want to know more right now, we'll have a link in the show notes.

66
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,320
Speaking of Microsoft, we thought it was notable that a rich and well positioned company like

67
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,460
the blokes out of Redmond were sounding the alarm this week about supply chain shortages

68
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,540
that were not going away anytime soon.

69
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:16,800
In reporting its Q4 2021 earnings, Microsoft disclosed that both its Surface and Windows

70
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,300
revenues were affected negatively by those supply chain constraints.

71
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:27,740
While they did note that remote work has continued to fuel PC demand, Microsoft and its OEM partners

72
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,100
had problems getting enough components, things like chips, power cords, and all the other

73
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,140
electronic parts that are required to make a new PC.

74
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,620
And Microsoft said this week, they don't expect this problem to get much better.

75
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,100
In their latest reporting, they said that Surface revenues had fallen 20%.

76
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,100
And year ago comparisons, well, it's pretty bad because a year ago, that was really the

77
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,380
height of people buying PCs for the remote work push.

78
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,140
So it was never really going to be a rosy comparison between now and then.

79
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,700
But Microsoft is warning Wall Street, they expect things to get worse, not just for them,

80
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,460
but really for everyone.

81
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:08,000
Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood told analysts on an earnings call that Microsoft anticipated

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,980
Surface revenues would continue to fall next quarter due to those very same supply chain

83
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,980
constraints.

84
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,740
But it's not just going to hurt for Microsoft.

85
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:20,940
Other vendors in the Windows ecosystem are expected to take a hit too.

86
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:28,620
Hood told analysts to expect Windows OEM revenues in Q1 2022 to decline mid to high single digits.

87
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,500
I guess it's just not a great time to be a Windows OEM.

88
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,940
But speaking of revenue, let's talk about Mozilla.

89
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,220
The story of Mozilla over the last few years has been a lot about their sources of revenue

90
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,900
and how they're going to survive.

91
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,420
And that story hasn't always been a positive one.

92
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,460
It seems outside of fancy ad deals, services revenue might be the only hope for an independent

93
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,300
Mozilla in the future.

94
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,420
So it's with that context that we've all been watching the rollout of their VPN service

95
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:00,740
with some genuine interest, even if they don't make a Linux client directly available.

96
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,100
Well this week, Mozilla announced some additional improvements to that lifeline of theirs.

97
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:11,180
Mozilla says as a result of user feedback, they've added split tunneling to their VPN.

98
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,520
This feature allows users to divide their internet traffic by choosing which apps will

99
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,460
connect through that VPN tunnel and which ones will just use your regular old open network.

100
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,980
Yeah, or put another way, users can just easily choose with a little UI which apps go through

101
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,980
the VPN and which ones don't.

102
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,940
And along with that, Mozilla has been working on a system to suggest users turn the VPN

103
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,180
on when they're in public Wi-Fi.

104
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,300
A feature that maybe tech users might find nagging, but average users could really benefit

105
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,340
from something like that.

106
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,620
And I think this is where I see Mozilla's role here with this VPN service and why I'm

107
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,540
not so upset they don't make a VPN client for Linux.

108
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:49,260
They're creating a service techies can recommend to normies.

109
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,220
They're not really creating a service for me.

110
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,140
I mean, they don't even target my platform of choice, but they are creating a service

111
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,900
I feel comfortable recommending to Android and iOS users who just want better privacy

112
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,900
at the coffee shop.

113
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,040
Yeah, they really do still have that reputation, right?

114
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,260
We trust that they'll get things right technically and that they have the right motivations and

115
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,780
philosophy behind them.

116
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,420
Now, if enough people can use it, maybe this thing will work.

117
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,420
I don't know.

118
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:20,820
You're right that I don't want to help anyone with their open VPN config if they're a normie.

119
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,200
After Valve announced the tech, some of us wondered if Linux's Steam client was really

120
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,360
up to snuff for the general public.

121
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,820
It seems Valve might have shared those very concerns.

122
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:34,960
A few days ago, they released a significant Steam beta update and Linux absolutely gets

123
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
in on the fun.

124
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:41,340
Yeah, the Linux version of Steam got quite a few specific updates, including many quality

125
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,460
of life improvements, along with some updates to the Linux container runtime, restored compatibility

126
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:53,380
with NixOS, significant performance improvements in the library UI, and silencing some annoying

127
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,180
preload messages you might have seen on the console.

128
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,380
I did indeed.

129
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,900
I am that guy that likes to run Steam from the console just to get all of the messages.

130
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:06,100
But I think the improvements that you're really going to notice are the ones in the UI.

131
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,940
And those are across Windows, Mac and Linux.

132
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,300
And what I'm most excited about is the new downloads page, which really is more minimal

133
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,420
and focused, and it has a variety of improvements over the old design.

134
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:20,860
I think just overall, the UI looks a lot more streamlined and approachable.

135
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,860
And I think it is really getting things more up to snuff for a new wave of users.

136
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:32,260
Another story we've been following for a while is the slow transformation of Chrome OS to

137
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,740
a workstation desktop is attempting to appeal to technical users.

138
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,500
Part of this effort has materialized recently in the team's attempts to make virtual desktops

139
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,020
more discoverable.

140
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:49,020
This drive to seemingly appeal to the quote unquote developers out there has seen all

141
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,500
kinds of engineering efforts recently invested into all desktop OSes in a way that doesn't

142
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,060
seem like we've really seen since the hype wave for mobile kicked off so many years ago.

143
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,100
I think in retrospect, Microsoft investing in things like WSL, that makes sense.

144
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,380
But Google's investment in higher end features in Chrome OS continues to surprise me.

145
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,060
It just it seems like it goes beyond the scope of Chrome OS, like what it was originally

146
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,580
created for.

147
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,620
But Google must clearly see otherwise.

148
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:20,900
And this push to get everyone to use virtual desktops now seems like a really clear signal

149
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,340
of just that.

150
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,900
And the latest development releases of Chrome OS will now have a persistent desk bar along

151
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,820
the top of the screen calling out your available virtual desktops.

152
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,840
Google's calling it Bento.

153
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,420
Now we're looking at development builds here, so things could always change.

154
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:42,740
But really what's new is the balance between simple and complex, shifting further to the

155
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,740
complex side.

156
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,780
I mean, Chrome OS has gone from sort of subtle about this to persistently being in your face

157
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,660
about a power user feature.

158
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,500
It really is a bold statement saying Chrome OS is becoming a full fledged desktop environment

159
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,580
where you can really get some work done.

160
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,420
And we thought this was worth passing along.

161
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,940
It's a milestone in the efforts to port Linux to Apple's M1 architecture.

162
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,260
Those of you hoping to run Linux on your M1 Macs will be happy to hear things are looking

163
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,260
up.

164
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,900
With Asahi Linux developer Alyssa Rosenzweig successfully got Debian running on a bare

165
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,980
metal Apple M1 with a mainline kernel, no less.

166
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,300
She built that upstream kernel with fellow Asahi Linux developer Sven Peters IOMMU patches,

167
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,640
which was required to get working USB support.

168
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,160
But it seems like there's actually full frame buffer support as well.

169
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,180
So you even got a basic X11 session available.

170
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:47,260
I think you might just call that a nearly working computer.

171
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,740
Linode.com slash LAN.

172
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:52,860
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

173
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,860
show.

174
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,940
This show is really made possible by you taking advantage of our sponsors offers and Linode

175
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:00,900
is one that we enthusiastically endorse.

176
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:05,140
You know, they started in 2003 as one of the very first companies in cloud computing.

177
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:11,480
And now 18 years later, Linode is the largest independent open cloud provider in the world.

178
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,140
With 11 data centers serving nearly a million customers and businesses around the globe.

179
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,780
But their mission remains unchanged.

180
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,740
Make cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible to all.

181
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,620
They do that with things like their S3 compatible object storage, VLAN support, powerful DNS

182
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,380
manager, a simple, clean interface, and much more.

183
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,900
Recently, Linode teamed up with the hackersploit team to release an ebook that helps you secure

184
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,440
your Docker installation.

185
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,900
This ebook focuses on the process from beginning to end, and we'll have a link to that in the

186
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,100
show notes.

187
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,460
It's free, not even your emails required.

188
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,860
Just go grab it and learn.

189
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,860
And once you get set up with Linode, if you ever run into any trouble, they've got the

190
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,940
best customer support 24 seven by phone or ticket, along with hundreds of guides and

191
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,620
tutorials to help you get started and one click application deployments that can just

192
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:05,180
deploy the base of a Linux box or all the way up to the application stack.

193
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,180
It's your choice.

194
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,980
Linode is such a great way to learn too, and Linode is investing in our community by making

195
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,220
the Jupiter colony reunion road trip possible with meetups in Salt Lake City and Denver

196
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,900
and more all along the way powered by Linode.

197
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,700
So go grab that $100, performance test your network, learn something, challenge something,

198
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,640
and maybe deploy something in production.

199
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,300
You just got to go check out Linode for yourself and take advantage of that offering because

200
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,300
it's fantastic.

201
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,680
Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing.

202
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,100
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

203
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,340
So sign up today at linode.com slash LAN, get $100 in 60 day credit, and you support

204
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:51,500
the show, linode.com slash LAN.

205
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,420
Linux.ting.com.

206
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,980
If you're sick of overpaying for cell service, go see how much you could save and then take

207
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,420
$25 off that, linux.ting.com.

208
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,220
Ting is an MVNO or a mobile virtual network operator.

209
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:07,680
What that means for you is they get access to the big carrier networks, but with way

210
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,260
better customer support and a lower cost for you.

211
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,020
Ting mobile gives you the same coast to coast coverage as you would with one of the big carriers.

212
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,380
You just get to pay less.

213
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,140
And that's why I've been a Ting customer since 2013.

214
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,420
Ting stayed flexible, reliable, and trust me, I changed it up.

215
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:28,300
And they've adapted like no other carrier could dream of.

216
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,820
And Ting's plans are simple and straightforward.

217
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,780
Like their new set 12 plan, which gives you 12 gigs of data with unlimited talk and unlimited

218
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,620
text, 35 bucks a month period, boom, out the door, there you go.

219
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,500
And be sure to check out Ting on Twitter.

220
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,200
They've been doing some giveaways recently.

221
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,040
They've got some great stuff they're featuring on their blog.

222
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,300
They have some tips for great cell phone battery life and maybe you might want to send that

223
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,580
to a friend or family to give them some gentle guidance on how to get the most out of their

224
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,460
phone because Ting's a carrier that geeks out about this stuff.

225
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,940
And if you use two gigs or 20 gigs, or maybe a lot more, there's a perfect Ting plan for

226
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,940
you.

227
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,500
Every plan comes with Ting's award winning customer service.

228
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:14,620
You get nationwide LTE and 5G and fantastic customer service with no contracts ever.

229
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,620
It's simple to switch to Ting.

230
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,220
Pretty much any phone will work, so just head over to linux.ting.com.

231
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,060
Check your current phone, sign up for a plan.

232
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,060
Ting will send you a SIM card.

233
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,880
You pop that in, you get activated in minutes.

234
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,420
It's so straightforward.

235
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:31,540
So cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier with Ting's brand new plans, but

236
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,720
you got to go to linux.ting.com to see it.

237
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,180
It truly is the next generation of Ting mobile.

238
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,180
It's here.

239
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,220
I can tell you I'm witnessing it and you could save.

240
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:48,460
So go to linux.ting.com.

241
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:54,980
After much secrecy, this week Google has turned on their latest undersea cable connecting

242
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,080
Europe and Asia.

243
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,600
The revelation of this development made us curious just how much of our intercontinental

244
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,980
connectivity was owned by the big tech companies.

245
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:12,460
The project's budget was estimated at $400 million and includes the laying of two subsea

246
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,460
cables.

247
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:18,580
The first, named Blue, will connect Italy, France, Greece, and Israel.

248
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:24,020
The second, named Raman, will connect between Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and India.

249
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,380
Reading through this, which we have linked in the notes, it was sort of revealing.

250
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:33,480
I didn't fully appreciate how much of our undersea international cables running along

251
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,860
the bottom of the ocean were owned by the big tech companies and the major hyperscalers

252
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,860
out there.

253
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,860
And it wasn't always this way.

254
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,760
It definitely started with Google, but it's rapidly expanded from there.

255
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,380
In an interview on the Data Center Knowledge podcast, Alan Molden from Telegeography shed

256
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:53,540
some light on these semi-recent developments.

257
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,220
Many of these hyperscale companies or content providers, whatever you want to call them,

258
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,500
they have very large demands for international capacity.

259
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,660
And so for years, they were buying capacity in the market from the traditional carriers.

260
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:12,240
But at some point, they were growing so fast and becoming so large, it made sense to actually

261
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:20,020
move to a different layer and opt to invest directly in submarine cable systems themselves.

262
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,460
So Google was the first one, as you mentioned, with their investment in the Unity cable,

263
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,460
which entered service in 2010.

264
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:32,200
And since then, you've seen them invest in many other cables from the world.

265
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:38,380
One was launched just this last week, the Do Not Cable from France to the United States.

266
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,340
And they are involved in many other planned cables.

267
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:47,980
So besides Google, Facebook also is a very heavy investor in new cables.

268
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:55,100
Also Amazon and Microsoft, to a smaller extent, also are investing directly in owning submarine

269
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
cables.

270
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,820
So you might be wondering just how far the private sector has gotten involved with these

271
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:04,120
international links compared to governments around the world.

272
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,800
Alan addressed that as well.

273
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:11,060
So governments do play a role really in helping more remote communities to build cables.

274
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:16,380
So if it's an island in the South Pacific, or some remote communities in the Arctic right

275
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,660
now, there is some government involvement there.

276
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:24,600
But largely, it's private funding that is being used to build and fund submarine cables

277
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,660
around the world.

278
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,420
This is an extremely expensive endeavor.

279
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:32,340
So it seems often what happens is the companies go in on a portion of the cable, and sometimes

280
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:37,140
more or sometimes less, and along with other companies, they'll kind of buy up this cable

281
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,860
and complete the deal.

282
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,460
And in some cases, they'll just pay for the entire thing.

283
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,500
How much bandwidth of the cables allocated to those companies is basically based on the

284
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,580
level of investment they've made into that particular cable.

285
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:57,580
So in the last decade, content providers have invested roughly about $20 billion in new

286
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,020
cables really all over the world.

287
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,580
And that's probably about 20, 30 cables that they've invested in.

288
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,220
And there's many more planned for the coming years.

289
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,500
I think looking at from what's planned to be deployed this year, in the next two years,

290
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,820
we could see another $8 billion worth of investment from content providers coming in.

291
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,740
Now, remember, they aren't the only ones investing in new cables.

292
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,640
So overall, there's going to be an even larger amount of investment coming.

293
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,580
The content provider share of investment, let's say, for the next couple of years, it's

294
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:38,140
going to be about 30% to 50% of the overall total.

295
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:44,060
But on certain routes, such as the Atlantic or the Pacific, there's a much higher concentration

296
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,620
of content provider investment.

297
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:52,340
That's really due to where they're trying to link, which is their largest data centers

298
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,420
in Europe and Asia back to the United States.

299
00:18:55,420 --> 00:19:01,060
Just to give you an idea here, the capacity of these subsea cables is crazy.

300
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:05,380
Earlier this year, Google broke some records with their Dunant cable, which has 12 fiber

301
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:13,260
pairs providing 250 terabits per second of capacity, or as they put it in a blog post,

302
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:18,020
enough to transmit the entire digitized Library of Congress three times every second.

303
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,020
Okay.

304
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,020
Wow.

305
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:23,140
You know, of course, all this must be happening in the background, because things have gotten

306
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:24,140
better, faster.

307
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,660
You know, I often am on a video or voice call with somebody who's in a totally different

308
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,340
part of the world, and you just take it all for granted now.

309
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,500
You know that there was a lot of investments happening, but I didn't really connect all

310
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,940
of the dots here, like Microsoft is another company that's been buying up a lot of cable.

311
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,340
Amazon, of course, or really anybody in the game is buying up portions of cable.

312
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,340
I don't know.

313
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,340
How do you feel about that?

314
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,940
It is a little strange to have the big hyperscalers sort of dictate where these cables lands,

315
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,660
and you just know that they're going to build this around their infrastructure, so it's

316
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,180
going to depend on which company and where they've already built their data centers.

317
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,460
And where they have customers, and they're going to be disincentivized to invest in areas

318
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,980
that don't have their customers or the appropriate topology for their data center.

319
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:16,400
But I suppose, in a way, because these large hyperscalers are investing in cables themselves,

320
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,180
it leaves governments with limited budgets available to invest in areas that the hyperscalers

321
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,340
wouldn't be interested in.

322
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,420
So it kind of helps a limited budget spread out a little more, I suppose.

323
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,420
Silver lining.

324
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,220
Part of me doesn't like the idea that we privatize the internet in any way, but then another

325
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,980
part of me has to realize, I mean, this is a massive cost.

326
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,380
I mean, they're literally doing this with submarines out there.

327
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,500
Think about the coordination and engineering that must be happening in these big tech companies.

328
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,820
It really is wild.

329
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,700
All of the systems that these hyperscalers are bringing in-house.

330
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,860
I mean, you think about the custom CPU development, you think about Microsoft making an operating

331
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,100
system for their switches, and then you think, well, yeah, let's just build some undersea

332
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
cables.

333
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100
Why not?

334
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,860
They basically must have their own internal telco departments that interface with other

335
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:06,100
telcos because what was revealed in this interview, which we have linked, is essentially the hyperscalers

336
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,220
just decided, well, let's stop dealing with the telcos and let's just go build it ourselves

337
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,500
and become telcos.

338
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,860
And that is just like a transition that happens.

339
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,940
So it's just a wild development.

340
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,940
But I guess the upshot is we have faster connectivity, right?

341
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,860
All the YouTube you could want.

342
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,980
But really, it just makes me think, what's it like having these jobs, working with these

343
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,660
cables under the water, actually laying them, connecting continents?

344
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,660
And how do you get that job?

345
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,980
Yeah, what's that job posting even look like?

346
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,020
I can't even really picture it.

347
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:43,460
But I think all Linux admins out there probably owe a debt of gratitude to those working on

348
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,700
those submarines doing that hard work.

349
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,740
It's probably not a fun job.

350
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,180
But we'll keep an eye on it and everything else going on in the world of Linux and open

351
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,180
source.

352
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,580
So go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

353
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:02,220
And linuxactionnews.com slash contact if you've got any subsea openings to send us.

354
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,020
And don't forget, we have those brand new linuxactionnews stickers at jupytergarage.com.

355
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:12,460
And get your mimosas ready for Coder Radio's new live time at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern

356
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,260
at jblive.tv.

357
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,200
As for us, well, we'll be back next Monday, of course, with our weekly take on the latest

358
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,980
Linux and open source news.

359
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,040
Thanks for joining us.

360
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:37,620
And that's all the news for this week.
