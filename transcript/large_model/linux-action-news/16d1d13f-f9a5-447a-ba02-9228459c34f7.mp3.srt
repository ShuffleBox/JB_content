00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,080
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,760
This is episode 13, recorded on August 6th, 2017.

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,760
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,760
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,760
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,180
Happy fake episode 13 to you.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,180
That's a little inside joke.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,880
Yeah, technically the 14th because of the beta episode we did.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,300
It's our secret, Josh.

10
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,680
That's our little secret.

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,680
Although you'd almost think it was the actual episode 13 because of some of the bad luck

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,520
the Corita Foundation has had recently.

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:46,000
Yeah, so it turns out that being a nonprofit and also selling stuff at the same time can

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,240
land you in serious trouble with the tax authorities, at least in the Netherlands.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,240
Yeah, yeah.

16
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,880
I guess the Corita Foundation thought everything was going along smooth when they set up their

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,760
foundation in 2013, they took advice of a local tax consultant and thought, okay, we've

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,440
got this all dialed in until Dutch tax authorities told them otherwise.

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,520
Essentially, they were operating as a charity, but also operating as a corporation to use

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,000
US parlance.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,160
And that sort of got them in a catch 22 situation.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:23,080
Yeah, they had claimed some VAT back that they shouldn't have and ended up with a 20,000

23
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,920
euro tax bill.

24
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,160
Yeah, that's awful.

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,000
And even after they were able to get it reduced to 15,000 euros, their accounting bill was

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
4,000 euros.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So, geez.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, so.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's bad.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah, that's really bad.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,880
And, you know, initially I thought, why does Corita need a foundation?

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,280
And I don't mean any disrespect to the project because actually quite a bit of the artwork

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,800
here at Jupiter Broadcasting was designed by artists using Corita.

34
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,420
So I really think it's a great tool, but I thought, why do they need a foundation?

35
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,300
And then I realized, oh, it's because, you know, they're paying Dimitri full time to

36
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:58,520
work on Corita and they have other obvious expenses.

37
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,600
It kind of shows you how much is involved just to build a great design application.

38
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,880
Once it gets to a certain size, it's more than code, Joe.

39
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,400
Well, yeah, that happens to a lot of projects, doesn't it?

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:16,120
You grow to a point where you want to get paid to do it and you can put your time into

41
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,200
it full time and then you need to have some sort of legal framework in place.

42
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
Yeah.

43
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,920
But even though they thought they had it in place properly, this has still come back to

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
bite them.

45
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,200
It's not ever going to be their strong suit.

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,440
They want to focus on code.

47
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
They want to focus on community.

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,680
They don't want to focus on tax law.

49
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
Who does?

50
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
Yeah.

51
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,480
But thankfully the community have come to the rescue.

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
Indeed.

53
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,320
In fact, it looks like a pretty big outpouring of support just days after their announcement.

54
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,520
In fact, on their blog, they write, we didn't expect the incredible response from all of

55
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
you.

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:55,840
9,500 awesome people have donated 9,562 euros at the time of writing this post.

57
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,140
But that's not all, actually.

58
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:03,080
They also had private internet access, a VPN provider step up and offer sponsorship of

59
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,800
20,000 euros, which is going to be fantastic for long-term investment.

60
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,240
And also very encouraging, 14 different people have joined the development fund, which is

61
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,880
also going to help with long-term development of Corita.

62
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,920
You said 9,500 euros there.

63
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:23,040
Well that was after one day and here we are a few days later and it's up to 36,000.

64
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,400
So they are completely sorted basically going forward.

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
I love it.

66
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Watch out Adobe.

67
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,360
Corita's coming for you.

68
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,880
Yeah, maybe.

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,560
Over on the GTK side of things, Guadic 2017 just wrapped up and it looks like it was a

70
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,240
whole bunch of upstream love in between Canonical and the Gnome development team.

71
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, and it looks like some firm decisions have been made now for Ubuntu 17.10.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,600
And for me, the most important one, moving the buttons back where they belong to the

73
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,600
right-hand side.

74
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,880
You went right for it, didn't you?

75
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,880
Yeah.

76
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,840
It seems like a trivial thing, but I actually think it's huge.

77
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,520
They say it's because of a larger design philosophy about the dock and etc.

78
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:08,840
But on the right-hand side where you expect those window controls to be says, we are Linux,

79
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:13,440
we are like everybody else, we don't have to have our buttons on the left.

80
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,920
Yeah, exactly.

81
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,720
I mean, that's kind of trivial, really.

82
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,280
The big news, really.

83
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,400
You mentioned the dock thing there, so they're going to have a dock that's not DasherDock,

84
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,960
which is a bit strange, but okay.

85
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,920
But really the big news is Wayland, that they really are going to go for it as default.

86
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,840
Wayland will be the default session.

87
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
I don't know.

88
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,880
I think there's also really big news in here.

89
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,480
So there's two things I think are really big news in here, actually.

90
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,320
First, a list of everything you're not going to get that you would expect from Unity, and

91
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,660
I think maybe we could just bang this off really quick.

92
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,120
This was from off the top of the head, it was no global menus.

93
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,300
The HUD's going to be gone, alt-tab behavior is changing, messaging menus are gone, volume

94
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,680
notifications are different, launcher integration via running apps and software center obviously

95
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,440
is different, lenses and scopes are gone, and other tweaks that are just Unity-specific

96
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,920
probably won't end up in GNOME, at least the version that's going to ship in 17.10.

97
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,360
Well, much like with Wayland, 17.10 is a real test release, isn't it?

98
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,560
Because not that many people are realistically going to use it, because you only get nine

99
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,200
months of support with it.

100
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,160
So it's really a testing ground for 18.04, which is what the majority of people are going

101
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,280
to use.

102
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,440
And so we're going back to the old days of instead of these interim releases just being

103
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,960
boring snooze fests, this is actually going to be really exciting and interesting.

104
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,160
And things are going to break probably, and they're going to have to use that development

105
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:45,040
cycle over the next nine months until we get to 18.04 to fix everything and make it ready

106
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,280
for the important one, the LTS.

107
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,120
Because although 17.10 is important and it's certainly academically interesting, realistically

108
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,760
are you going to put it on any of your machines for more than just testing purposes?

109
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,440
Not unless I'm planning to go to 18.04, if 18.04 is solid.

110
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,240
So I think you're right, now here's the thing I think will need the most testing.

111
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,200
I think there's some really big news tucked in this post that we have linked in the show

112
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
notes.

113
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,760
So a lot of talk about working upstream, and it sounds like at Guadic there was a lot of

114
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,520
back and forth from the GNOME developers on how to implement some of the modifications

115
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,680
that Canonical wants to ship with GNOME, extensions, the doc stuff, the ambient theme.

116
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,560
How do they do that without just stacking GNOME full of extensions?

117
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,080
In this post, they talk about implementing modifications as a GNOME shell mode, not as

118
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,400
a bunch of extensions and themes lacquered on top of GNOME, but as a mode that would

119
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,760
be listed at the login manager, just like the way GNOME Classic is implemented.

120
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:50,080
This will enable Canonical to deliver another session using their upstream fonts, icons,

121
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,960
and their theme, and also a standard session that uses the upstream GNOME fonts, the Adwadia

122
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,320
theme, the upstream shell theme, with no extensions applied, like a stock GNOME.

123
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:06,520
So you'll have multiple options, and when you choose the Canonical session, it's going

124
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,920
to be all built in.

125
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:13,840
And after reading this implementation, it left me wondering why isn't this the way every

126
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,080
distribution ships their implementation of GNOME?

127
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,480
Well, because it's kind of a non-standard way to do it.

128
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,440
Surely the standard way is make it stock with extensions, which can then be removed.

129
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,760
And OK, Canonical are going to ship the option to have stock GNOME, but that's not going

130
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,120
to be default, is it?

131
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,120
And I think that's why other distros don't do that.

132
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:42,560
This to me feels a little bit like the old Canonical that we thought had changed, not

133
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
invented here.

134
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,080
Oh, I completely disagree.

135
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,320
So not only does my gut tell me that this was the way the folks at Guadic suggested

136
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,960
Canonical go, like this was their advisement, I think Canonical was going to do it the way

137
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,160
you just outlined.

138
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,760
Then they went to Guadic and they said, you know, we've built this mechanism, and we've

139
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,840
even designed GNOME Classic to try to show people how to do it, so that way you can deliver

140
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,720
an experience using GNOME that doesn't have to depend on all of these breaky things.

141
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,360
And it was designed for that.

142
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,600
GNOME Shell was created to allow this.

143
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,240
So it seems to me the way that the GNOME project would actually recommend people do it and

144
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,920
not just sort of hack on a bunch of extensions and themes and then ship it and then just

145
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,440
hope that everybody's packages hit the repo at the right time when you're doing your updates.

146
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,680
Well, I suppose so.

147
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,120
But it does feel like it's Canonical taking on more of the, well, not technical debt,

148
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,200
but you know, taking on more of the development.

149
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,400
Yeah, yeah, I suppose so.

150
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
I'll dig around.

151
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,320
I'll do some more reading about it and see if we can't ask some folks that work at Canonical

152
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,780
and get a better sense of this implementation, because it was a little vague in the blog

153
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,780
post too.

154
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,200
So it's an area, I think, that probably deserves further discussion.

155
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
Yeah.

156
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,360
All right, well, let's talk about blue phones, BLU.

157
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,480
This is a story that I almost put in last week, but I thought, I don't know if it's

158
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,920
necessarily true.

159
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:09,200
And it's come back around this week in that Amazon stopped selling them for a while.

160
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:16,000
So these are low budget Android phones, basically, which are actually these days surprisingly

161
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,320
quite well-specced for the price.

162
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,580
Indeed, yeah.

163
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,960
So Cryptowire found out, I think it was a few months ago, wasn't it, that these phones

164
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:35,800
were phoning home, haha, back to China with information about text messages and all sorts

165
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,280
of stuff that you want to keep private and don't want to be sending to some server in

166
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
China.

167
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,280
Sure.

168
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,000
And it seemed that BLU had sorted it out, but now Cryptowire are saying that they haven't

169
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,100
and that's why Amazon pulled the phones, but now they've basically put them back on the

170
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,320
site or certainly some of them.

171
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,720
So it's a very confusing story that there seems to be a lot of misinformation here.

172
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Yeah.

173
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,960
And what I parsed out from this is a couple of odd things happened on the back end.

174
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,200
Amazon pulled them down, but then other resellers stepped up to do fulfillment.

175
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,480
So the phones essentially continued to ship even though the official BLU store was shut

176
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,920
down, which, come on, Amazon, do your job right.

177
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,160
But in fact, these phones were sending data back to China.

178
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,100
BLU is a Chinese company and there's a piece of software installed on these phones that

179
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,240
sends back different metrics.

180
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,560
And like all of these wonderful pieces of software, the vendor can choose how much they

181
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,520
turn it up and how much they turn it down.

182
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:41,680
So they can send all the things and they can send just diagnostic metrics, version information

183
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,440
and basic details, which BLU claims that's what they're sending.

184
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,540
But even that, I don't really want to happen.

185
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,200
Maybe if you could opt into it or at least opt out of it.

186
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,080
But if it's happening in the background without you realizing it, I don't know.

187
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,280
This is just what I dislike about OEM generally and stock ROMs.

188
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,760
That's why I use Lineage and other custom ROMs, because at least it's mostly open source.

189
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
There you go.

190
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,760
Yeah, that's definitely a safer way to go, I would assume.

191
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,720
This seems to be a reoccurring story, especially on the lower priced Android phones.

192
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,840
And I almost wonder, this is nobody's really going to love this suggestion, but maybe the

193
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,760
better solution would be for Google to share all the data they collect on all of us with

194
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
the OEMs.

195
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,880
Now, I don't like it, but then these guys wouldn't be rolling their own software that

196
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:39,160
uses who knows what type of encryption implementation and is talking to who knows who and is including

197
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,560
who knows what information.

198
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,400
And it might be better if Google just took every little bit of information they're recording

199
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,080
about you, anonymized it, and shared it back with the hardware vendors.

200
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,680
You said gave and shared there.

201
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,220
I don't think that's going to happen.

202
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,040
Maybe sold back to the OEMs.

203
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,040
Yeah, good point.

204
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
Good point.

205
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,040
And you know what?

206
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,120
Either way, it just makes Android more creepy.

207
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,760
If the vendors are doing it or if Google's doing it, it's creepy.

208
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,000
Yeah, just send it all back to Apple, eh, like you do.

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,720
Yeah, well, it could be worse.

210
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,600
It could be sending it to some unknown open source project that's doing god knows what

211
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,760
with it.

212
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,760
DigitalOcean.com.

Sign up and use our promo code, here's the thing, to support the show and get a $10 credit

214
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,680
on some really, really great services.

215
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,100
DigitalOcean is infrastructure in seconds.

216
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,280
You can sign up and deploy a droplet, that's their parlance, in 55 seconds or less.

217
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,720
One of the things that makes it super fast is they use SSD storage everywhere for your

218
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,680
droplet and for the block storage you can attach as you need it.

219
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,920
They have lightning fast network, 40 gigabits to each hypervisor, highly available storage.

220
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,740
They have built-in monitoring and alerting team accounts if you want to work together

221
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,740
with people.

222
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,880
And one of my favorite things for testing, pre-built droplets with entire open source

223
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,180
stacks or just a base system.

224
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,800
I really love that feature.

225
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,480
Well, I suppose my favorite feature is the straightforward pricing.

226
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,080
DigitalOcean.com, go over there and use our promo code, here's the thing.

227
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,280
You create the account, then you apply it and you're good to go.

228
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,120
DigitalOcean.com, promo code, here's the thing.

229
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:18,040
Okay, so we've gone 13 proper episodes without mentioning Bitcoin and now we have to do it.

230
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,040
Lucky 13.

231
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,040
Yeah.

232
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,480
So I'm not massively interested in Bitcoin because it's basically a Ponzi scheme as far

233
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,240
as I'm concerned, which may be a controversial opinion, but there you go.

234
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,720
Okay.

235
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,040
That's a big event happened that I've been watching over the last few months unfold.

236
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,600
And it happened this week.

237
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,320
It was basically forked as Bitcoin Cash.

238
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,380
And so if you had Bitcoin already, you're going to keep them, but you've also got these

239
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,640
Bitcoin Cash now, so money has just appeared from nothing.

240
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:58,560
Well, this is the interesting thing that stands Bitcoin Cash out from all of the other alternative

241
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,560
cryptocurrencies.

242
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,440
They didn't just fork the code.

243
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,640
They forked the blockchain.

244
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,600
They forked the ledger.

245
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,480
And when they made that fork, all of the transactions that have ever occurred on the network went

246
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
with them.

247
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,560
So essentially, it's like a parallel timeline now.

248
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,420
It's a side five parallel timeline where the transactions that happened are still valid

249
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,960
in both of these now two separate blockchains.

250
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,160
And it did surprisingly well, didn't it?

251
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,960
Some people were saying that it was just going to tank straight away.

252
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,960
Yeah.

253
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,560
There's been a lot of mounting pressure since I did a podcast a couple of years ago about

254
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:39,560
Bitcoin called Plan B, and this was beginning to really simmer because it's a core issue.

255
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:45,400
Original Bitcoin, just BTC, has a limitation of a shared transaction ledger.

256
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,080
Each one of the blocks is limited to one megabyte.

257
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,760
And that's good and bad depending on who you talk to.

258
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,360
And that's one of the things that Bitcoin Cash wanted to change is they wanted to increase

259
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,880
that size.

260
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,160
And that's also good and bad depending on who you talk to, but it actually just comes

261
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,340
down to this really trivial, quote unquote, change.

262
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,720
One megabyte limit to a higher value.

263
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,960
And when you make that change, it has huge ramifications because it means machines that

264
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,800
are trying to download the blockchain and process transactions have to download more

265
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,840
data or less data depending on which blockchain you're on.

266
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:27,400
That means it may isolate out smaller players who don't have huge amounts of storage and

267
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,660
enable big players or vice versa depending on who you talk to.

268
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:37,480
So all of the transaction history prior to August 1st, 2017 is in both of these blockchains.

269
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,160
And now we just get to sit back and see which principle is essentially better and watch

270
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,880
which Bitcoin companies step up to support it.

271
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:49,680
Like Coinbase has been sort of dragging their feet and now they've announced months down

272
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,800
the road they're going to implement Bitcoin Cash support.

273
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,720
Yeah it hasn't had the support that I think the Bitcoin Cash people wanted, has it?

274
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,040
Perhaps yeah, maybe it hasn't.

275
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,660
I think people are waiting to see where it goes.

276
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,680
And I think there's a bigger open source story here.

277
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,740
Blockchain technology itself, distributed database technology that is cryptographically

278
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:15,600
verified is something that IBM and Oracle and the Linux Foundation and Bank of America

279
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,920
and a lot of other really big players are investing heavily in right now.

280
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,620
So I wonder if they're sitting back and trying to see which is better because they're going

281
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,200
to be basing a lot of their future transaction technology off of blockchain technology.

282
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,280
It's crazy to say it, but these huge players are getting into blockchain applications.

283
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,280
But the bigger block size for them isn't going to be a huge issue because they're not consumers.

284
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
It's not everyday people.

285
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:47,240
They've got the money to pay for huge servers that don't really care whether it's one megabyte,

286
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,280
eight megabytes or even bigger.

287
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,800
And they may do entirely different backend data storage techniques than what we see today

288
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,040
in the open source project.

289
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,580
But it's still interesting to see the organic blockchain stuff really struggling to figure

290
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,740
this out.

291
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,620
There may be a similar sort of battle in the commercial space, different feature sets of

292
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,820
different blockchains.

293
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,640
And this is just the beginning of it.

294
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,040
So you didn't just immediately sell out your Bitcoin cash because you've got a few bitcoins.

295
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,720
You know, I'm just standing by at this point and just kind of going to see where it goes.

296
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,280
Bitcoin itself, as we record, is at thirty two hundred dollars right now.

297
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,700
Yeah, it's nuts.

298
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,960
So I feel like at this point, it could go all the way to the moon and it could crash

299
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,040
down to nothing.

300
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,240
So I'm just going to hold and see where things go.

301
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,720
How much was it worth back in the plan B days, then a couple of hundred?

302
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,720
Yeah.

303
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,720
Yeah, I think so.

304
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,720
Yeah, that's what I mean.

305
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,120
I don't think I ever paid more than two hundred dollars for a Bitcoin.

306
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
Maybe not even that much.

307
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
Hundred and seventy five.

308
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
Yeah.

309
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,840
Man, I thought about investing at the time and I just kept thinking, it's going to crash.

310
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,840
It's going to crash.

311
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,960
It just keeps on going up and up.

312
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,000
That's the classic Bitcoin conundrum.

313
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,960
Well, that's why it's a Ponzi scheme, because, you know, the people who get in now are just

314
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,460
not, you know, they're not going to make any money.

315
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,460
Or maybe they will.

316
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,120
They'll go up to maybe a hundred thousand dollars a Bitcoin, because that's it's got

317
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,400
that built into it, these tiny fractions.

318
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,240
And that was kind of always the plan, wasn't it?

319
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,240
That one no one would trade in one Bitcoin.

320
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,640
It would be tiny fractions of it.

321
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Yeah.

322
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
Yeah.

323
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,640
You never know, Joe.

324
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,680
Maybe eventually, eventually you'll set up an online business and take Bitcoin as a payment

325
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,680
and you'll make it big.

326
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,680
You'll become a Bitcoin billionaire.

327
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,840
You never know.

328
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,520
In the meantime, Firefox has a few more experiments that you could burn some time while you watch

329
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
the Bitcoin market.

330
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
Yeah.

331
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,240
So Mozilla have been spending their Yahoo money on more stuff.

332
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:47,680
The most interesting one to me is send.firefox.com, which works, I understand, in other browsers.

333
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,280
And it's private encrypted file sharing.

334
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:56,640
So it's kind of a competitor to WeTransfer, where you basically send a file through email.

335
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,980
So you email them a link.

336
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:05,400
And in this case, it gets stored on the server for one day or for one download.

337
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,060
And then it's deleted forever.

338
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,780
Isn't that sort of the interesting feature is that it's a limited time link, which means

339
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:16,080
maybe Mozilla doesn't have to be as concerned about what people are uploading because it

340
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,240
all gets deleted?

341
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,740
Well, does it really get deleted, though, because it's on AWS.

342
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,500
So I suppose it gets deleted after a fashion.

343
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:30,420
But if there's something that the authorities really want to know about, then they're going

344
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,260
to find it, I would imagine.

345
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,220
This is a really odd thing for them to be working on.

346
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,220
It sure is handy.

347
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,360
But boy, if you're running on S3, that's just nothing but a cost center for them.

348
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:44,340
If you look at testpilot.firefox.com, there's a couple of other ones that jump out at me,

349
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,220
like a snooze tabs experiment and a container experiment for Firefox.

350
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:54,700
Not like Docker container, but you can create containers for different social media accounts

351
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,400
or Google accounts.

352
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,840
And every tab in this container will be logged in as one account.

353
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,980
And you can have multiple tabs with multiple containers all up on the screen at the same

354
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,980
time.

355
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,400
So in one tab, I could have my work account.

356
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,180
In another tab, I could have my personal account.

357
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,540
And it's not incognito.

358
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,920
It's contained profiles.

359
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:18,080
Pretty nice feature, sort of similar to how Chrome does personas, but even a bit nicer

360
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
than personas.

361
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,540
I do worry about the CPU and RAM overhead for that, though.

362
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,460
Just throw all the hardware at it, Joe.

363
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,580
It's the modern workload.

364
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,820
It's the web browser workload of the future.

365
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,940
These kind of features, though, where they're building in things like snoozing tabs and

366
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,900
containers into Firefox, that stuff strikes a, that's what I want Mozilla working on kind

367
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,500
of know with me.

368
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,660
Send, pretty nice to have.

369
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,980
But if it went away tomorrow, there'd still be 100 alternatives.

370
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,660
And they wouldn't all be cost centers for the Mozilla project.

371
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,860
But it's a pretty nice one at that.

372
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,820
Yeah, and what's interesting to me about Send is that it's our own source, the Mozilla

373
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,820
public license.

374
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,820
So you can host it yourself.

375
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,820
Yes, you can.

376
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,820
That is really nice.

377
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,820
It's up on GitHub.

378
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,820
I was looking at that.

379
00:20:58,820 --> 00:20:59,820
And that is impressive.

380
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,380
It's cool to see them working on, well, I don't know, code stuff, you know, and not

381
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:08,420
like so much political stuff or huge, like, the common voice stuff is great, but it seems

382
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:14,060
so massive and so nebulous, whereas this feels like I can actually apply it to my Firefox

383
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,060
experience right now.

384
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,580
It's like it's really tangible.

385
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,860
So I like to see that kind of stuff.

386
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,660
Well, the common voice, it seems that they are implementing it already with their voice

387
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,660
search.

388
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,140
So they're pretty serious about that stuff.

389
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,140
Mm-hmm.

390
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,140
Yeah.

391
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,180
Red Hat's pretty serious about file systems.

392
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,400
And so that's why when they announced that they were deprecating ButterFS, it caught

393
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,580
a lot of attention.

394
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,260
It doesn't look good for B2FS, ButterFS at this point, does it, if even Red Hat's given

395
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,260
up on it?

396
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,260
Yeah.

397
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,260
Yeah.

398
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,820
They say the ButterFS file system has been in technology preview state since its initial

399
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,740
release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

400
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,260
And that Red Hat will not be moving ButterFS to a fully supported feature, and it will

401
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,620
be removed in future major releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

402
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:05,420
Well, here we are a year, more than a year, after Canonical put ZFS into Ubuntu 16.04,

403
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,280
and they still haven't been sued, and it looks like they've got away with it.

404
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,480
They would say there was nothing to get away with in the first place.

405
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,940
But Red Hat is just not willing to take that risk, by the looks of things.

406
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,060
They'd rather develop something completely new, because they don't have any faith in

407
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:25,560
B2FS, and they don't want to take the risk on ZFS.

408
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:31,700
So that really speaks volumes to me, that I thought that Canonical would be the test

409
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,980
ground, and if they got away with it, then Red Hat would follow suit.

410
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,780
Do you suppose it's because Red Hat's principally a US company, and so perhaps they have a different

411
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,500
target painted on their back?

412
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,820
That is certainly possible, yeah.

413
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,180
I wonder.

414
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:50,820
It is damning for ButterFS, because I think what it really speaks to, and I go back to

415
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:55,580
this, is it seems like eventually ButterFS could be turned into something pretty great,

416
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,160
because it's close.

417
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:04,620
But that name is now associated with a dumpster fire file system, and it's bad branding.

418
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:09,900
And if you don't want to be the consultant or the sys admin going in and saying, yeah,

419
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,940
I'd like to deploy all of these terabytes and terabytes and terabytes of very important

420
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:20,660
files on ButterFS, that's a really weak case to make, and it just takes somebody Googling

421
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,820
your proposal and then just totally shooting you down.

422
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,660
It's essentially a toxic brand.

423
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:30,980
Yeah, whereas XFS that Red Hat seems to be doubling down on doesn't have that baggage.

424
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,980
Right.

425
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,500
XFS is really, really well respected.

426
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,340
I've deployed it myself in production for years.

427
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:43,380
It's a solid file system, it has a great lineage, and if you combine Red Hat's newfound love

428
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:49,900
for XFS with some recent acquisitions and an overall project they're working on, you

429
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,700
start to see the story of what could be their ZFS alternative.

430
00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:00,580
So on August 1st, Red Hat announced they've acquired Permabit, which is a company that

431
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:06,500
builds data duplication, or sorry, de-duplication and compression software.

432
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,440
You may not have heard of them because they focused on selling directly to OEM, so they

433
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,220
would bundle their solution on top of Linux.

434
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:21,900
It includes kernel modules and Red Hat seems to think it's better for containers and virtualization

435
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,660
where they have really fast storage and they want to compress down on that really fast

436
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,660
storage.

437
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:31,900
Having talked to Alan Jude about this, it actually is a very common work case because

438
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:38,900
CPUs are so fast and NVMe storage and SSDs are so fast that the system can read and write

439
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,520
more when it's compressed and read it faster because the files are small, so you actually

440
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,080
get higher throughput using compression and you get more storage space.

441
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,040
It's not like your grandpa's compression.

442
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,060
It's some really modern day stuff and Permabit's one of the companies that's working on this

443
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:55,780
on Linux, well, and now they're owned by Red Hat.

444
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:01,380
And so their new strategy is going to be called Stratis, which is not ready yet and it's looking

445
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:07,540
like it's maybe two or three years out before we have feature parity with ZFS, but they

446
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,980
are really going for it.

447
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,900
Yeah, Stratis is an interesting approach.

448
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,580
So a lot of you out there will love the fact that it's supposedly it's written in Rust,

449
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,580
which if you're going to be building file system layered tools, Rust is a good language

450
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,580
to use.

451
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:24,560
So in this scenario, you could take a base file system like XFS and then Stratis takes

452
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,260
a layered approach to replace ZFS's individual components.

453
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,620
So Stratis can lay on a copy on write layer using components that are pretty much already

454
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,580
built into Linux, a raid layer using, again, stuff already built into Linux.

455
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:42,300
In fact, most of the functionality in ZFS is throughout Linux in all these different

456
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,300
parts.

457
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,580
It's just not all in one single file system.

458
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,820
So Stratis is a layered approach that will sit on top of XFS or potentially other file

459
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,140
systems and bring in these types of features, probably using a little LVM on the back end

460
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,140
too.

461
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:59,380
Now, some of you may cringe at this, it's taking some of Linux's most well-developed,

462
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,380
tried and true features and bringing them all under the Stratis umbrella to all work

463
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,380
together.

464
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,380
It's actually a pretty solid approach.

465
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,780
If you take tools that are tried and true in production in the enterprise environment

466
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,740
for years and get them all working together, it's probably going to work pretty quick.

467
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,740
It's probably going to be pretty solid and trusted.

468
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,180
Or you could just use ZFS.

469
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,500
Or yes, you could just use ZFS.

470
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,780
In fact, this is the big competition is canonical is saying, hey, look, you want an Ubuntu LTS,

471
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:28,060
you got live patch, lots of people love to run it in production, and now we've got the

472
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,060
ZFS file system.

473
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,980
Come on, we've already got this stuff.

474
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,340
And you've got to imagine this is Red Hat going, crap, ButterFS didn't get there.

475
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:36,580
We've got to get this going.

476
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,620
It has to be production ready.

477
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:42,620
Enterprise customers are expecting a certain level of performance reliability out of the

478
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,940
box today.

479
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,940
We've got to pivot.

480
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,060
We've got to, quote unquote, pivot, Joe, and make this change.

481
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:54,540
And this has got to be a response in at least some little amount to Ubuntu shipping ZFS.

482
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,900
I just have to see it that way.

483
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,180
But it just goes to show that BtreeFS must be in a pretty ropey state.

484
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,940
Otherwise, why don't Red Hat just put their resources into that and make it better and

485
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,940
improve it?

486
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,940
I think it's the brand thing.

487
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,180
I think it's the dumpster fire branding.

488
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,720
It's just gotten to the point where nobody's really, well, it's a joke.

489
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,180
It's a bit of a joke file system.

490
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,860
And I think they're just saying, well, we can't compete with that.

491
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,160
We're not getting a lot of traction.

492
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,820
It's a hard sale.

493
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,260
And I think the other question I have to ask now is, when does SUSE make a change?

494
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,260
Or will they?

495
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,880
Well, I was going to say, tell that to Richard Brown.

496
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,880
See what he says.

497
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,880
Well, I would ask him.

498
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,880
You're going to see him soon.

499
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,880
You should bring it up.

500
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
Yeah.

501
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,860
Well, when I last spoke to him, I asked him about it.

502
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,980
And he said, it's fine.

503
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,660
They just don't put in the RAID stuff that is broken, and otherwise, it works fine for

504
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:40,660
them.

505
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:41,660
Yeah.

506
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,660
You use a couple of build flags.

507
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,660
You throw on a couple of patches.

508
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,420
You disable a couple of features.

509
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,420
It's fine.

510
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,420
There's nothing wrong with that.

511
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,100
The file system should work.

512
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,460
I wonder if they will move away from it, because they do seem pretty sold on it, don't they?

513
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,460
Yeah.

514
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,460
It's pretty well integrated.

515
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,940
Part of me, to be honest, hopes they don't.

516
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,620
Wouldn't it be great if they just don't care about the dumpster fire branding, and they

517
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,140
just kept hacking away at it?

518
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,060
And say, five years, we come back to it, and it's solid.

519
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,720
They've really made it into a great product.

520
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,820
That could be great for everybody.

521
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,820
Yeah.

522
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,140
And then we've got three options at that point.

523
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,140
Yeah.

524
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,140
Take that, ZFS.

525
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,140
A proper Linux thing.

526
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,780
In one replacement, we build three great ones that all have their own advantages, and nobody

527
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,780
can decide.

528
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,780
That's how it should be.

529
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,780
Yep.

530
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,780
Exactly.

531
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,780
Yeah.

532
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,780
OK.

533
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,780
Good.

00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,020
