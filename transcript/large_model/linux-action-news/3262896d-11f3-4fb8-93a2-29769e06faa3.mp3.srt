00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,640
This is episode 46, recorded on March 25th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,640
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,640
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,720
It's good to be connected with you, and it's good to start with a bit of news that makes

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,240
me smile.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,240
WebOS is not dead yet.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,240
What?

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,240
WebOS?

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,040
That OS from many, many years ago is not dead, and there's an open source edition now?

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,480
That can't be right, can it?

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,560
It is, and it's perfect.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,840
It's perfect.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,160
For some reason, it's just a little OS that won't go away.

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,240
As you know, it's been bumped around a bit by HP and then over to LG.

17
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,080
And now LG wants to expand the adoption of WebOS, and the company is working with the

18
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,720
South Korean government to solicit business proposals to figure out how they might want

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,640
to use WebOS.

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Did you ever have one of the HP touchpads back in the day, then?

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,760
Yeah, for a limited time, for a couple of months.

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,960
I played around with one before I gave it away as a gift, and I loved WebOS.

23
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,800
I even got to play for a couple of months with a pre.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,600
Do you remember the Palm Pre?

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
Oh, yeah.

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
Yeah.

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,120
I mean, it was a long time ago, but really, they were ahead in a lot of ways.

28
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,920
Now, this is the WebOS open source edition.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,460
So it's not quite what you and I knew, and it's currently aimed at developers.

30
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,240
There's an SDK available as well as instructions for building the OS and even running it on

31
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,840
a Raspberry Pi 3.

32
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,320
Which is what I did today.

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
No!

34
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,880
Oh, man, I almost got it.

35
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,600
I tried to do this before the show, Joe.

36
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,440
I got my Raspberry Pi set up, and I had a total SD card failure, and I wanted to try

37
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,440
it.

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,500
And I figured Joe must have done this.

39
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,040
So tell me about it, because I was so close, Joe.

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,240
I got it flashed on the SD card, I got it put in the Raspberry Pi, I got it hooked up

41
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,760
to power and a mouse and a keyboard and my screen, and then I went to boot it and I got

42
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
nothing.

43
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,760
Oh, right.

44
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,100
Well, did you build it yourself, though?

45
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,680
Because that's the only instructions that are on the website that you have to build

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,640
it and you have to get cloned and all the rest of it, but I went and found a pre-built

47
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,880
image because I was not in the mood to wait four hours for it to build on my laptop.

48
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
Yeah.

49
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,560
That's exactly what I did.

50
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,600
In fact, I'll include an extra bonus link in the show notes.

51
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,480
Linux Action News, episode 46, so go to linuxactionnews.com, slash 46.

52
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,720
I got a link in the show notes just after the news for the story, but maybe these images

53
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,040
don't work because it is the one I tried, and I got nowhere.

54
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah, well, it worked for me.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,320
It took a little while to boot up, but it's very limited once you get it booted.

56
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,840
If you look in the article that we've linked to, there's only one app, really, YouTube,

57
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,240
which kind of worked for the video, but the audio was all stuttery and just didn't work

58
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
properly.

59
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
What about...

60
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Well, there's a web browser.

61
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
What about the web browser?

62
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:09,720
The web browser wasn't in the version that I had for some reason, so I didn't get to

63
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,920
check that out, but otherwise, it was just as the WebOS open source edition website really

64
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,320
with just all the info about how to get involved with it, and this is very, very much aimed

65
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,600
at developers at this stage.

66
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,040
It's not a user-facing, a user-ready daily driver, any of that.

67
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,280
It's for developers to hack on and companies who want to put it on devices.

68
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Yeah.

69
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,640
At this point, you get the launcher, support for notifications, and a couple of basic system

70
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,840
apps, like system settings, and there is supposedly a modified version of Chromium on there.

71
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,320
So you got it closer than I did.

72
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,600
I gave it a go, did not get that far, but it doesn't sound like I missed much yet.

73
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,080
So it's early days, it sounds like.

74
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,980
Yeah, but it was very slick, what I saw of it.

75
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,260
Everything worked quite well with little animations and everything.

76
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,280
It wasn't stuttering.

77
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,480
It wasn't locking up and stuff.

78
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,800
It seemed for this really bare bones OS to actually be pretty solid.

79
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,800
So I've got quite a lot of hope for it if people can add the applications to it, but

80
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
that's the thing.

81
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,240
They don't call it WebOS for nothing.

82
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,000
All of it's based on HTML technologies and CSS and everything.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,360
And haven't we seen that before with Firefox OS and that really didn't go anywhere, did

84
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,360
it?

85
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,360
Yeah.

86
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,320
If you're just looking for web apps, I don't think it's going to be a winner.

87
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,700
But if you're looking for an operating system to empower your Internet of Things device

88
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,680
and you don't want to have to create some sort of complicated relationship with Google,

89
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,200
this I could see actually being a possible market for WebOS open source edition.

90
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,400
And I believe that's why the South Korean government sort of putting feelers out there

91
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,080
right now saying, hey, if you got Google concerns, we've got this other Linux based OS, same

92
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,000
kind of internals that you're all kind of hot and bothered about, but totally different

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,520
licensing and totally different company.

94
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,600
Don't worry, it's LG.

95
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,840
Just those aspects alone could make it appealing.

96
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,160
I mean, that's what Canonical was coming at when they were developing Ubuntu Touch

97
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,880
is they were another Linux based OS that wasn't Google.

98
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,680
Yeah, and there seems to be this backlash, isn't there, that people don't trust Google

99
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,680
and they want to get away from Android if they can.

100
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,360
But with it being just ubiquitous, it's very difficult to do so.

101
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,880
So it's always good to see competitors in the space.

102
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,880
Yeah.

103
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,720
And keep in mind, there's a whole world of things that aren't necessarily mobile phones.

104
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,120
There's televisions, there's toasters, there's wall plugs that just are Wi-Fi plugs that

105
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,520
need to run some kind of operating system that's backed by some kind of company that's

106
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,840
going to keep them secure.

107
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
Yeah.

108
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,380
Well, as we all know, if you've got an Internet of Things device, you're definitely going

109
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,360
to want to run a hypervisor on it.

110
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,880
Well, in the era of big processors, multi cores, and lots of RAM, maybe?

111
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,720
That's what the Linux Foundation is hoping, and it's called Acorn.

112
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,360
It's a hypervisor that's built with real time and safety critical operations in mind with

113
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,080
a huge chunk of code contributed by Intel.

114
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,600
This is very much aimed at the automotive market, isn't it?

115
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,700
Which is a bit strange because there's the automotive grade Linux from the Linux Foundation.

116
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:21,160
But they do stress that competition is good, and they do accept that there are various

117
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,160
solutions here.

118
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,120
Obviously, you've got Zen as a hypervisor, but that is relatively bloated compared to

119
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,080
this new Acorn.

120
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,360
They talk about how, yes, there are existing technologies that this is effectively competing

121
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,040
against, but they say that that's a good thing, and competition will drive innovation.

122
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,400
Think of Acorn as positioned specifically for the automotive market, and then all of

123
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,080
a sudden, it starts to make sense why you'd want a specific hypervisor to meet those needs.

124
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,640
You need certain scenarios to prioritize workloads when you're driving, like safety.

125
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,800
So conventional hypervisors, they don't really do that.

126
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,320
You can say, give more memory to this application or this machine.

127
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,880
But you need a hypervisor that is real-time aware, that can know when to starve the entertainment

128
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,120
system of resources in order to ensure the driver's safety, and that's what we're dealing

129
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
with here.

130
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,120
Acorn addresses these issues by being small, first of all.

131
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,640
The project claims it'll have just 25,000 lines of code compared to, say, over 150,000

132
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,280
lines of your most basic data center hypervisor.

133
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,240
So number one, it's going to be a small project.

134
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,240
But number two, it's going to be aware of the workloads that are on it specifically

135
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,920
for embedded devices.

136
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,180
Today, cars have several computers linked over the CAN bus system.

137
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,840
But in the future, many cars already are being built this way, and many manufacturers are

138
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,180
going this way.

139
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,080
There will be a central computer, for better or worse, that runs everything.

140
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,760
And the idea here, and there's a lot of companies like Intel that are backing this, is to run

141
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,360
a hypervisor on that central computer and isolate the individual workloads.

142
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,060
That arrangement would essentially mean fewer integration hassles and lower costs for automakers,

143
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,580
and it also means that the hypervisor would be aware when safety-first issues need the

144
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,440
priority versus you picking the next track on your MP3 files.

145
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,820
It's funny this future, isn't it?

146
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,400
In the past, it was a case of, if your car broke, you could get your friend who's quite

147
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,700
handy to fix it, whereas now, you want someone who's a programming expert to come and fix

148
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,880
your car for you.

149
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,000
There's no denying we're moving away from the Unix philosophy when it comes to automobiles.

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,480
Instead of having dozens or maybe hundreds of individual systems and components that

151
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,520
are specifically suited for their job and make the car run well, we're moving to a centralized

152
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,840
monolith that will have isolated components dedicated to the different aspects of the

153
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
car.

154
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,840
I'm not sure which one's better.

155
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,280
And it's good to see Linux and open source being at the forefront of this new way of

156
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
doing things.

157
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:56,160
I'd much rather the Linux Foundation was doing this than some other big company that doesn't

158
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,960
care about open source.

159
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:03,220
When it comes to problems front and center in your face, a lot of us have been experiencing

160
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,080
issues with Gnome Shell recently, and there's been additional attention on this this week.

161
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
I'll put it that way.

162
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,400
Yeah, so Joey over at IMG Ubuntu has posted about this memory leak, which, haven't you

163
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,880
been talking about this for months and months and months with your OBS machine needing to

164
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,600
be rebooted all the time?

165
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
It's been bad, yeah.

166
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
It's been ridiculous.

167
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,160
In fact, anybody that's used Gnome Shell with some regularity has probably run into this

168
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,600
particular problem.

169
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,460
It really essentially begins when you first do something that creates an animation, like

170
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,380
hitting the overview screen or all the applications.

171
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,460
It just starts slowing down from there.

172
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:47,000
One of the many reasons I don't like animations, but even so, it doesn't happen in plasma and

173
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
stuff, does it?

174
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,380
No, no, it doesn't.

175
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,960
It seems to be kind of related to how Gnome Shell is built, being single-processed, all

176
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:59,640
kind of one process doing everything, and Joey over at IMG Ubuntu sort of laid it all

177
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
out.

178
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,800
Gnome Shell, right out of the box, will typically consume somewhere around 70 megabytes of RAM.

179
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,480
I mean, not bad, really, considering how much it does.

180
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:14,640
However, that jumps to about 95 megabytes of RAM after opening a menu, and maybe 250

181
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,520
megabytes depending after you load, say, the icon grid of all applications with about 90

182
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
icons.

183
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,960
And this will get worse if you have more extensions or more icons or more things happening with

184
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,040
the Gnome Shell.

185
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,920
And this has somewhat been patched, but it doesn't seem to have quite worked.

186
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
Yes.

187
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,940
Now, there is a workaround, and Joey does mention it in the post here, and it's just

188
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,560
simply to restart Gnome Shell.

189
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,560
And you know how to do this.

190
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,040
You hit Alt-F2, type in R, hit Enter, boom, Gnome Shell will restart, and you don't tend

191
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,040
to lose application state, but it's very fiddly.

192
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,240
Yeah, that's not really an acceptable fix, is it?

193
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,840
Or at least it shouldn't be.

194
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,360
And it's not the only bug that surfaced this week.

195
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,080
There's also this performance bug relating to the clock, where just changing the digits

196
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,680
of the clock causes slowdowns.

197
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,800
I mean, you really wonder what is going on with Gnome Shell.

198
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,880
I mean, I'm so happy I'm sitting here on XFCE.

199
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,040
Oh, here we go.

200
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,320
Of course, it's a moment to talk about XFCE, because there's no other desktop that can

201
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
get this right.

202
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,240
So this is really something.

203
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,360
And I've noticed this myself.

204
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,160
And the bug that I've linked in the show notes, again, linuxactionnews.com slash 46 calls

205
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
it out.

206
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
You may have noticed this too.

207
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,680
If you went into the Gnome clock settings and turned on the show seconds, which I have

208
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,560
done because I am on air and want to time things very precisely.

209
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,240
So I've turned on the show seconds, I have it turned on in plasma right now, I'm looking

210
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,940
at the seconds, it's a useful thing.

211
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:49,080
And it turns out that involves a massive redraw of the entire desktop to iterate the second

212
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,300
counter.

213
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,600
And the bug doesn't go this far, but I have personally experienced every extension you

214
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,220
have that is updating the UI is updating the entire UI.

215
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,280
Because the Gnome shell is a single process.

216
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:09,280
The entire desktop from the extensions to the animations is all one process.

217
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,580
And so I was in a point where I had, I love it, an extension that would tell me my ping

218
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,780
milliseconds and an extension that would tell me the Bitcoin price and an extension that

219
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,060
would tell me my CPU usage.

220
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,960
And I had the clock with the seconds displayed.

221
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,720
Because I assumed in 2017, I could have a modern desktop.

222
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,200
I was wrong, 2018 has been a year of learning for me, but 2017 was a year of being wrong.

223
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,160
And what I discovered was every single extension I had that was updating my Gnome shell with

224
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:47,920
current information, like the CPU, like the Bitcoin price, like my ping millisecond response

225
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,600
time, like the seconds on my clock, were all dramatically slowing down my desktop.

226
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:03,120
To the point where my mouse cursor began to pause as I moved it around the screen.

227
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,080
Suddenly your mouse turned into Shatner.

228
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,600
Yeah, I had the William Shatner of mouse curses when I was on Gnome 3.

229
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,400
And the only temporary fix was to disable the very extensions that I found made the

230
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
shell usable.

231
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,580
Well, come on, this isn't a huge problem.

232
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:24,960
It's not like every single major distro is using Gnome at this point.

233
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,200
Linux Academy.com slash unplugged.

234
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,000
It's an advanced training tool that increases your skills and encourages critical thinking

235
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,400
around everything that has to do with Linux.

236
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,480
It's a full featured training library with everything you need to learn new skills and

237
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,120
advance your career from Azure down to how to build the file system outright.

238
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:47,080
It's a great resource with self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux and cloud and

239
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,060
DevOps topic with hands-on scenario-based labs that give you real experience on actual

240
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,300
servers that you get to SSH into, which makes all of the difference for somebody like me.

241
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,200
And if you ever get stuck, if you need help, they have full-time human instructors that

242
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,860
are ready to help and advise you on your questions.

243
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,400
And if life is busy, Linux Academy understands.

244
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,120
They've got a course scheduler where you can pick a course and set a timeframe to help

245
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,480
fit your schedule and your learning goals.

246
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,680
Now I love a certain aspect of Linux Academy that I failed to mention and I want to mention

247
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,680
it today.

248
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,760
They have a flashcard system that is completely open source.

249
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,840
It's something that's forked by the community.

250
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,280
And using these flashcards help you remember what you learned because you're presented

251
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,160
with the information in a different order every time.

252
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,000
It just kind of comes at you randomly.

253
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,920
And you can share the flashcards that have worked best for you and the whole deck if

254
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,200
it's been a good deck.

255
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,600
And use those cards and decks by yourself, by the instructors, and the students and mix

256
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,600
and match them.

257
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,000
It's a whole aspect of the community that I think really helps you prepare because people

258
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,600
that go take the tests and pass them come back and share their experience and help you

259
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
prepare.

260
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,600
That's a great resource that nobody can touch.

261
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,680
You combine that with the full-time human beings, the servers they spin up, and the

262
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,200
endless content, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

Nothing beats it, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

265
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:17,200
So it's been a bit of a bad week for Mozilla and Firefox, specifically with the master

266
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:24,080
password, which it turns out for the last nine years has been using SHA-1 with an iteration

267
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,120
count of one.

268
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,800
So this is the master password that protects all of your saved logins, if you choose to

269
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,080
enable it, of course.

270
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:38,720
And it is very, very easy to brute force unless it is incredibly long.

271
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,040
Yeah, this came out after the author of the Adblock Plus extension looked into this a

272
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
little bit.

273
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,240
He says, I looked into the source code and I eventually found the function that converts

274
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,760
passwords into encrypted keys, and it's not nearly enough.

275
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,840
Anybody who's designed a login function for our website will likely see the red flags

276
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,880
here from about nine years ago.

277
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,680
In fact, Mozilla themselves have had a bug against this since they implemented this feature

278
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,040
nine years ago.

279
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:12,120
Yeah, and using SHA-1 in the first place, I think it was a year or two ago, Google proved

280
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,420
that you can have SHA-1 collisions, which basically renders it MD5 quality at this point.

281
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:24,120
And to only do one iteration of it when standard practice would be 10,000 or maybe 100,000,

282
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,280
that is not good at all.

283
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,760
What's the point if you're only going to do SHA-1 times one?

284
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:33,880
In the age of everyone having a GPU everywhere, it gets a lot easier to crack these.

285
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:38,440
Yeah, you'd think they'd be using SHA-256 or something at this point, but they've got

286
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,160
a different plan to solve this instead, haven't they?

287
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,680
Yeah, they're working on a couple of different plugins, and there's a few in the fire right

288
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,680
now.

289
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,040
And one that seems to have the most promise is Lockbox.

290
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,160
It's being developed by Mozilla as an extension.

291
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,640
It is alpha quality right now, but it's a total replacement for the Firefox password

292
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,640
manager.

293
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,840
So really, who isn't using LastPass at this point?

294
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,920
You know, I, as a longtime LastPass user, have recently become more and more frustrated

295
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
with it.

296
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,800
I would be interested in switching off, but I tried out Lockbox for the TechSnap program

297
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,520
recently because we talked about this on TechSnap.

298
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
Totally not there yet.

299
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Not ready.

300
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,520
In fact, Mozilla hasn't even committed to Lockbox as the future master password extension.

301
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,960
Yeah, you would have thought that Mozilla would have sorted this out by now.

302
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,700
I mean, it's been long enough, and they've got enough money sloshing around.

303
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:32,080
You think that they would have their own built-in competitor to the likes of LastPass?

304
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,400
I know there are open source alternatives, but it'd be nice if there was something just

305
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
baked into Firefox.

306
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,680
I mean, they've got Pocket in there.

307
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,640
Maybe before they did stuff like that, they should have thought about some security fundamentals.

308
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,040
Yeah, I do think it's better to outsource this particular function.

309
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,380
As Wes pointed out on TechSnap, it's not like Firefox has been built from the ground up

310
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,040
to be a password manager.

311
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,480
And maybe we shouldn't expect that from our web browsers, and we should offload that to

312
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,260
a dedicated application.

313
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,400
And so I like the idea of Lockbox or KeyPass or LastPass.

314
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,320
It's just picking the one that's best for you at this point.

315
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,720
Yeah, but I'm always dubious of proprietary solutions, especially ones where they get

316
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,320
their database dumped and leaked online.

317
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Hmm.

318
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,160
Although that was a long time ago, let's not worry about that.

319
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,380
But it's not the only Firefox story this week.

320
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:26,400
There's also some changes possibly maybe coming to how they deal with DNS queries.

321
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,440
This one's gotten a bit of pushback from privacy people, as often happens with these kinds

322
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,920
of announcements when they're doing something that involves sending your data to a third

323
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,920
party.

324
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,060
Now, Firefox is experimenting with a certain amount of test users with sending DNS lookups

325
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:46,320
to a Cloudflare hosted service, which means a third party that you did not configure your

326
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,320
system to go to.

327
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,800
Now, obviously, DNS is a pretty critical point to loading websites and getting them to respond

328
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
fast.

329
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,840
And now more than ever, DNS seems to be getting screwed around with, manipulated as a form

330
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
of attack.

331
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,500
And DNS services are also sometimes just simply poorly provisioned, creating performance problems.

332
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,680
So Firefox thought they could solve this issue.

333
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Yeah.

334
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:12,240
And in theory, it sounds good, doesn't it, DNS over HTTPS so that it's properly protected.

335
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,600
But why bring Cloudflare into it?

336
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:18,680
Well, they're definitely a name brand, and they definitely have the services and the

337
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,960
infrastructure to support something like this.

338
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,760
I mean, think about Firefox's scale.

339
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,160
Even with a small test, you're probably still dealing with hundreds of thousands, maybe

340
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
even a million users.

341
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,680
So you've really got to be able to handle that load.

342
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,800
But the issue is that Cloudflare is a US backed company.

343
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:37,200
But even as a user of Firefox, like Chris Dubble from New Zealand pointed out, even

344
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,620
if it's only Mozilla's nightly browser, and just for a short period of time, he's still

345
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:49,280
disturbed at the possibility of an opt out only service, sending all visited host names

346
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,060
to a third party US company.

347
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,360
That he's uncomfortable with.

348
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,000
Yeah, and it is only in the nightly at the moment.

349
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,360
But the nightlies tend to be where the features that end up in the main version go.

350
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,360
So if this goes well for them, the chances are it probably will make it into the main

351
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,840
Firefox.

352
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,760
So I think it is right to be raising this as a red flag right now.

353
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:19,640
But Mozilla do point out that they are only testing this and user feedback like this is

354
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,680
valuable to them.

355
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:26,240
So hopefully, they will get the message and it will hopefully only be a few hundred thousand

356
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,840
people or whatever a small percentage of the nightly users who will ever have this happen

357
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,840
to them, at least to have it be opt out.

358
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,960
By all means have it be opt in and if you're happy sending all your DNS queries to Cloudflare,

359
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
then good luck to you.

360
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,760
But I don't think I'll be opting in.

361
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760
Thank you very much.

362
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,320
I do understand where Mozilla is coming from because they have to compete with Google who

363
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:52,840
can afford to accelerate all kinds of things server side even offer to proxy every single

364
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,520
user's traffic and recompress it and save on bandwidth for them.

365
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,680
So that's what they're competing against is an entity that has almost unlimited server

366
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,800
side capabilities with Chrome.

367
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:09,120
And that's just going to become more and more apparent as Chrome and Firefox develop.

368
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:14,280
Well another way the Mozilla is copying Google, or you could say Firefox following in crimes

369
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,400
footsteps is that they might well start blocking some adverts.

370
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,440
Yeah, it appears that Mozilla intends to add basic ad filtering capabilities to its Firefox

371
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,400
browser later on this year.

372
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,840
That would be at least according to a development roadmap.

373
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,560
Over the next year or so, Firefox will take a stand against trafficking, intrusive ads,

374
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,480
and of course, dark patterns on the web, as they put it.

375
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,560
Do you feel that they're a little bit late to the party on this one?

376
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,560
Yes.

377
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,560
And it's a little awkward, like the language they're using here is a little suspicious.

378
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,360
They're not using the term ad blocking, they're using the term ad filtering.

379
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:57,500
And content blocking versus content filtering are two totally different things.

380
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:01,640
Ad filtering makes it sound like somebody is going to be taking an active role in deciding

381
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,640
what is a bad ad versus a good ad.

382
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,780
Which is an almost impossible task to have a human in the loop.

383
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:12,840
And even if you have an algorithm, that's not necessarily going to do a perfect job,

384
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,840
is it?

385
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,320
So the register tried to sort all of this out and they emailed the Firefox product manager

386
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:25,040
and he wrote back and Peter said that the roadmap describes future plans, some of which

387
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,200
are still in early development, so don't get too set on any of them.

388
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,180
He says, we are researching and in some cases developing various methods of blocking invasive

389
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,940
forms of advertising.

390
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:42,540
This includes auto-playing videos, in-content pop-ups, and a variety of other deceptive

391
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,240
quote-unquote practices.

392
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,980
While these methods are based on ad and content types, their final approach will be announced

393
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,620
at a later date.

394
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,720
And they expect to integrate the functionality directly into Firefox when they've decided

395
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,460
on what it is they're going to do.

396
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:01,120
Well you would hope that Mozilla will be responsible with this and just block really nefarious

397
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,800
stuff and let reasonable adverts through, but it does remain to be seen exactly how

398
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
they handle it.

399
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,480
Yeah, and what's the definition of a reasonable advert?

400
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,560
Is my definition the same of Mozilla's?

401
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,880
We'll just have to wait and see.

402
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,400
And it's not the end of days yet.

403
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,760
This is something they're going to be working out over perhaps the next year.

404
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Okay, so I've got several copies of the Bitcoin blockchain on various hard drives and this

405
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,960
week I started to think, hmm, maybe I should delete those.

406
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,800
I mean only if you don't want to be a pedophile.

407
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,640
You're not a pedophile, are you, Joe?

408
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,200
No, and I'm not a terrorist or whatever else is hiding in there.

409
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:43,520
Yeah, this is based on a new research paper that's come out again and then I laugh only

410
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,320
because I covered this story when I was doing Plan B and Plan B was before I ever launched

411
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,360
Linux Unplugged.

412
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,480
So this is an old story, but it keeps coming up and people keep adding more junk to the

413
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
blockchain.

414
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,840
You see, the blockchain has this whole provision for adding arbitrary data.

415
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,920
Imagine a contract, you're signing with somebody and you want to have specific details of the

416
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:09,000
contract on there, like Joe will not have any cats jumping on the recording equipment

417
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,280
during the recordings of Linux Action News.

418
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,580
Say we wanted to have like a, I don't know where that would come from, but say we had

419
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:18,480
like a contract where that was in place and we wanted that in the blockchain, you could

420
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,680
add arbitrary text like that.

421
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,460
And so researchers from, well, a lot of different places, but this is a new paper as available

422
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:32,960
as a PDF, have identified 1,600 files that have been added to the Bitcoin blockchain.

423
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:40,240
59 of which include links to unlawful images of child exploitation, politically sensitive

424
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,760
content, and privacy violations.

425
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,000
This is incredibly worrying.

426
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:52,320
And I genuinely am thinking about deleting the blockchain data that I've got because

427
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,480
I just don't want to fall foul of the law.

428
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:02,720
And okay, there's probably a defense there, but now people know more about this.

429
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,180
And as you say, this was known before, but now it's resurfaced.

430
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,360
People might be putting stuff in there just to troll people, although it is quite expensive

431
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,560
to do that, isn't it?

432
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,960
Yeah, there is a transaction fee potentially.

433
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,600
I do think people are doing this just to troll folks as well.

434
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,640
All the blockchain data, think about this for a moment, and this is why Joe's worried.

435
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,060
All blockchain data, if you have a full wallet, is downloaded and stored by every single user.

436
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:35,520
And so in some countries, they could be liable for the content that's on their own hard drive.

437
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,080
And it could be illegal content.

438
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,900
Now keep this in mind though, the blockchain is a text ledger.

439
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:50,240
So what you are getting at absolute best is encoded links to pornography.

440
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,000
You're not getting the actual pornography in the blockchain.

441
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,840
You're getting an encoded sequence of hex that you then have to extract and decode and

442
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,920
reconstruct a link and then visit that link.

443
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:12,320
You say that, but it may be possible to hide binaries in there if you really wanted to.

444
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,600
Well, and there are services, I have one linked in the show notes called Cryptography and

445
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:21,780
others that essentially do the encoding and decoding for you and almost make it like a

446
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,160
messaging service.

447
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,080
In fact, Cryptography will just have like some of the latest messages that have been

448
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,840
added to the blockchain as arbitrary data and you can just download them.

449
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:36,080
But it does beg the question of how easy it would be for a government to put in stuff

450
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,320
that is illegal so that they can then outlaw Bitcoin in that country.

451
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,520
Oh, that's proper bacon right there.

452
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,880
I mean, we got to put all of this in the context, right?

453
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:56,360
So we're talking 1.4% of the roughly 251 million transactions as of this recording on the Bitcoin

454
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,360
blockchain.

455
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,000
So I mean, we're talking a tiny amount and then at that, it's encoded data that you have

456
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,040
to implicitly decode and reassemble into a dirty link.

457
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:12,040
I don't know really how liable anybody's going to be for that, but it does seem particularly

458
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
spicy.

459
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,940
It does seem like something that's going to get attention and it could be something that

460
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:19,080
regulators opt to hone into if they feel motivated.

461
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:25,200
But you know, when reading about this, that 250 million figure really jumped out at me.

462
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,920
That's all the Bitcoin transactions ever.

463
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:32,320
How many visa transactions happened during the recording of this show?

464
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,480
Probably somewhere around 250 million, I would have thought.

465
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,880
It really goes to show how far behind Bitcoin is in terms of actual transactions, doesn't

466
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,880
it?

467
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,640
Yeah, the scale of it.

468
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,600
Now as we record, I mean, it has gone up.

469
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:55,520
Right now, if you go to blockchain.info, we're somewhere around 306 million transactions.

470
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,200
But again, how many visa transactions today happened or MasterCard or whatever?

471
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,720
From what I understand, that's about how many transactions Visa has in a single day.

472
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,280
Yeah, exactly.

473
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,600
So the scale is just massively different.

474
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:14,240
Yeah, but you're still a dirty bird, Joe, with all those files on your hard drive.

475
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,000
You better start deleting those blockchains.

476
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

477
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,960
