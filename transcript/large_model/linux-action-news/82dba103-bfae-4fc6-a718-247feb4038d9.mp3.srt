00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 261, recorded on October 5th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,480
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,480
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,480
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,560
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:20,760
This week, IBM announced it was slicing off another part of Red Hat, loosely known as

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,600
the Red Hat Storage Team, and transferring it to the IBM Storage Team.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:33,080
Stating in their announcement, quote, with the move, IBM will integrate the storage technologies

9
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:41,640
from Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, or ODF, as the foundation for IBM Spectrum Fusion.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,400
This combines IBM and Red Hat's container storage technologies for data services, and

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:52,640
helps accelerate IBM's capabilities in the burgeoning Kubernetes platform market.

12
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,240
Well, I can't speak to names like Spectrum Fusion and if Kubernetes is still a burgeoning

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,440
platform, but in my opinion, IBM's focus on storage here, it's probably a savvy one,

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,520
even if it's a bit alarming to some of us long timers.

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,000
Storage really seems like an area that IBM still holds a lot of credibility in the industry.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,120
And it's been clear to some of us that OpenShift and the technologies around it, well, they

17
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,480
were a significant motivating factor for that $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat a couple

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,440
of years ago.

19
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,600
And it truly is part of their whole hybrid cloud strategy that they're just so on about.

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,200
And storage is obviously a big part of that.

21
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,240
Ceph also, widely deployed, is part of this as well.

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,820
But IBM says Ceph will remain 100% open source, and IBM will assume the premier sponsorship

23
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,000
of the Ceph Foundation.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,600
But somewhat ironically, IBM made a big deal about Red Hat being a neutral vendor that

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,840
would remain independent to eliminate any vendor lock in concerns while they're building

26
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,240
out that bold hybrid cloud future.

27
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,200
Those might have just been things you say during an acquisition because we got a new

28
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,600
CEO now and those concerns are out the window.

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,840
I mean, I recall right after the acquisition for a while, Jim Whitehurst must have been

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,120
quoted a dozen times he became famous for saying, quote, Red Hat will still be Red Hat.

31
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,680
How many times did we hear that?

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,200
I guess the thing he just left off was there was an expiration date on that statement.

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,920
And even more recently, on July 13th, 2022, IBM's CEO was asked about Red Hat, the CEO

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,080
transition and the future changes coming to Red Hat.

35
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,680
Speaking of Red Hat, new CEO just named.

36
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,280
What changes will this bring?

37
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,460
This doesn't really bring any change.

38
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,320
This has been planned for a while.

39
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,720
Look, Paul Cormier gave us four years since we announced the acquisition.

40
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
He's not gone, by the way.

41
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,880
He's still here as chairman.

42
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,120
And Matt has been in his wings for a long time.

43
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,760
Matt has worked for Paul for almost 16 years.

44
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,400
So we shouldn't expect any significant change.

45
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,400
And Matt was the leader behind our OpenShift strategy, behind containers for the last three

46
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
years.

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,200
He's been leading products inside Red Hat.

48
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,520
So you should expect more of the same, more intensity, more of a doubling down on the

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,000
winners, but not a significant change.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,760
Now, it seems perhaps those winners are being divided amongst the strongest departments

51
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,480
within IBM.

52
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,380
And with a tone that almost reads a bit like rewriting history, in the announcement materials

53
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:36,140
provided in advance by IBM, they now state that, quote, IBM acquired Red Hat to become

54
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,320
the world's number one hybrid cloud provider.

55
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:47,080
Going on to say, IBM now offers the only open hybrid cloud solution to unlock the full value

56
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,360
of cloud for our customers.

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,080
Well, I think it's also notable that this, quote, acquisition wasn't announced maybe

58
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,800
just a few days ago at Mobile World Congress, Las Vegas, where Red Hat announced OpenStack

59
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,360
Platform 17.

60
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,240
Staffers were there, exulting the virtues of integration of the OpenStack platform with

61
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,720
OpenShift platform and seemed to really be all about the integration of the two.

62
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,840
In fact, it's been suggested that the staff didn't even know about the news about essentially

63
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:24,520
becoming IBM employees until hours before the public did.

64
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:31,520
NextCloud Hub 3 was announced this week with three significant areas of development and

65
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,120
a whole lot of performance improvements.

66
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,920
But the change you might notice the most is what they're calling a fresh, accessible,

67
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,720
and personalized interface.

68
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,920
Yeah, there's a lot of work that has gone in there.

69
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:51,560
And also to that end, a lot of work went into mouseless options, assistive software such

70
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:58,880
as screen readers, light and dark modes, keyboard shortcuts, and a font for people with dyslexia.

71
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,720
I suspect though the headline feature for many of our listeners who use NextCloud at

72
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,560
home will be Photos 2.0.

73
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,840
It's got a new UI for viewing and editing your photos.

74
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,360
NextCloud Photos can also now automatically tag photos, recognizing things like cars,

75
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,640
trees, food, faces, and a whole lot more.

76
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:23,720
Plus it's going to group those in the people tab, allowing you to name them and naturally

77
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,220
search for them based on those tags.

78
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,700
And I suspect the headline feature for those using NextCloud in an organization will probably

79
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,560
be the improvements to NextCloud Talk.

80
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,800
It's looking very slack these days, and I mean that in a good way.

81
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,520
NextCloud is touting its improved widgets that expand in chat for website links, videos,

82
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,600
tasks, other things that are integrated in with NextCloud.

83
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,320
And just Talk seems overall extremely integrated into many aspects of NextCloud now, making

84
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,640
it a genuine collaboration suite for a group or a business.

85
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,640
And to kind of round out what's seeming like a Teams and Office 365 killer all in one vibe,

86
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:10,160
Mail 2.0 debuted with much improved performance, a whole new user interface, and streamlined

87
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,040
account setup.

88
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,000
The NextCloud team made special effort to highlight a range of performance and security

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
improvements.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,280
Just a couple of highlights for you are now end-to-end encryption performance impact was

91
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,040
reduced by 75%.

92
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,500
And also key management for users was introduced into the user settings.

93
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,880
And server-side encryption's data usage was reduced by 33% in this release and it introduces

94
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,560
support for S3 primary storage and group folders.

95
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,280
I also think that there's some new integrations that are worth a quick mention here, including

96
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,600
Zimbra and Open Project integrations that will probably be handy for some users.

97
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,320
But I could really see our crew digging the new Google Drive integration that lets you

98
00:06:53,320 --> 00:07:00,180
import your Google calendars, contacts, photos, and files directly into NextCloud.

99
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,920
If you're interested, we'll have a link to the full announcements in the show notes with

100
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:11,560
screenshots of that shiny new UI.

101
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:17,200
With NVIDIA recently open sourcing their kernel module, Jason Ekstran over at Collabrub, along

102
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,400
with help from Carol Herbst and Dave Erlie at Red Hat, believe right now might be the

103
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,440
ideal time to reboot the Nuvoo driver stack.

104
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,880
And Jason is calling this project NVK.

105
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,040
So what is NVK exactly?

106
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,680
Well, it's a new open source Vulkan driver for NVIDIA hardware in Mesa.

107
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,880
It's been written almost entirely from scratch using those new official headers provided

108
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,960
by NVIDIA.

109
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,480
But one of Jason's personal goals for this project is to become the new reference Vulkan

110
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,100
driver within the Mesa code base.

111
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,820
This mad lad, I love it.

112
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,280
Jason says he's trying to build NVK to be as modern as possible.

113
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,060
He's building with Vulkan in mind.

114
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,140
He says in the announcement, quote, I'm building NVK with all the best practices we've developed

115
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,660
for Vulkan drivers over the last 7.5 years.

116
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,160
And I'm trying to keep the code base clean and well organized.

117
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,340
That sounds pretty great to me.

118
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:23,760
He then goes on to say, quote, long term, the hope is for NVK to be for NVIDIA hardware,

119
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,360
what RADV is to AMD hardware.

120
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,480
However, that's a pretty high bar.

121
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,600
RADV is quite a mature driver with a lot of features and fantastic runtime performance.

122
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:40,480
There's a lot of work between where we are now and RADV level driver quality, but it

123
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,200
gives us a goal.

124
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,280
And it seems like things are actually moving pretty darn quickly considering NVK has only

125
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:54,500
been in development for just a few months and it's already passing 98% of the Vulkan

126
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,120
testing suite.

127
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,360
As for supported hardware, well, Jason says that currently they're targeting Turing

128
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,500
Plus and he's using an RTX 2060 for testing.

129
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:10,800
But with the Loveless cards coming out soon, he'll likely upgrade to one of those for

130
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,540
development before too long.

131
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,800
The results are in on Debian's general resolution vote regarding including non-free firmware

132
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
in the installer image.

133
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,540
And the winning option does indeed allow the installer image to include firmware necessary

134
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,280
to use your system.

135
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,220
The vote also changes the Debian social contract to make it clear that including non-free firmware

136
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,300
in this manner is allowed.

137
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,500
As one commentator on LWN said, quote, nobody is excited about binary blobs, but this is

138
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:52,280
a huge step forward for usability.

139
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:58,680
An alarming bug has been discovered in the Linux kernel version 5.19.12 and as a result,

140
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,600
Intel laptop users are being advised to avoid that version.

141
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,720
Intel Linux laptop users on Linux 5.19.12 have begun reporting white flashing display

142
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,640
issues, with one user describing it as, quote, the laptop display starts to blink, like lights

143
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,100
in a 90's rave party.

144
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,840
An Intel Linux kernel engineer posted on the kernel mailing list, quote, after looking

145
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,600
at some logs, we do end up with potentially bogus panel power sequencing delays, which

146
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,640
may harm the LCD panel.

147
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:41,760
As a result, Greg Hage has immediately released Linux 5.19.13, with the problematic Intel

148
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,240
graphics driver patches reverted.

149
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:50,160
Greg commented, quote, this release is to resolve a regression on some Intel graphics

150
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,200
systems that had problems with 5.19.12.

151
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:01,920
And if you do not have this problem, there's no need to upgrade.

152
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,240
Linode.com slash LAN, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and it's

153
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,360
a great way to support the show.

154
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,520
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

155
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,280
Developers trust Linode and Linux geeks love it.

156
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,780
That's really how we've built and run everything that we deploy in the cloud for the last couple

157
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,900
of years.

158
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,560
Linode is even a huge part of the infrastructure that we use when I go on the road.

159
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,960
And of course, Linode makes it possible for us to go on the road.

160
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,040
I first discovered Linode at a Texas Linux fest.

161
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,360
They were like, one of the few vendors that took this really early event serious and made

162
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,440
it possible with both their support and just, you know, throwing bodies at it and being

163
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
there.

164
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,120
And I thought, you know, they're not getting a lot from this, but they are investing in

165
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
the community.

166
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,560
I thought that's, that's worth checking out.

167
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,080
I put them on the back of my mind.

168
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,220
Next time I'm building something, I'm going to try them out.

169
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,920
And sure enough, I did just that.

170
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,280
I tried out Linode for myself for my own personal stuff that I was building and I loved it.

171
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,620
And when Jupiter Broadcasting went independent, Linode was one of the first names I called

172
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,580
because I was such a happy customer.

173
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,840
And now it's, you know what, it's been over three years.

174
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Wow.

175
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,840
Wow.

176
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,840
That's incredible.

177
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
And Linode has been a big part of that story.

178
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,080
Linode has been a big part of the story of us going independent and really the infrastructure

179
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,080
we have built that has really been competitive is thanks to Linode.

180
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,940
And they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the big hyperscalers that want to lock you into their

181
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,740
crazy platforms where they got weird names for everything.

182
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,720
And Linode has the best performance.

183
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,360
This is shown over and over again by third party reports.

184
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,280
You can find them online.

185
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,340
I've done some testing myself and they have 11 data centers for you to choose from with

186
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:41,020
great features like object storage, cloud firewall, and VLAN support that lets you span

187
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:44,600
a private network across multiple regions with Linode.

188
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,360
Some powerful stuff there.

189
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,240
And of course, if you ever need help with support, if you ever need to do any data recovery,

190
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,420
they have clear, easy to understand backups and your infrastructure management tools are

191
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,220
going to work great with Linode.

192
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,220
Just us.

193
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,220
We do it already.

194
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,180
So go build something, go learn something and try it for yourself.

195
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,720
And it's a great way to support the show while you're getting a hundred bucks at linode.com

196
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
slash LAN.

197
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,320
Go get that 60 day credit, kick the tires for yourself and support the show.

198
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:18,360
That's linode.com slash LAN, collide.com slash LAN.

199
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,280
Collide is endpoint security that just uses the most powerful untapped resource in IT,

200
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,520
the end user.

201
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,640
When you're trying to achieve security goals, whether it's for yourself or a third party

202
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,400
audit, maybe it's new leadership.

203
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
I have been there.

204
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,680
The conventional wisdom is to treat every device like Fort Knox.

205
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,320
You know what I'm talking about?

206
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,520
Old school device management tools like MDMs that force disruptive, awful agents onto employees

207
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,600
devices that slows down performance and treats privacy as an afterthought.

208
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,600
And let's be honest, sometimes introduces their own security vulnerabilities.

209
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,240
That's the way things have always been done.

210
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,880
And it turns IT admins and end users into enemies.

211
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,220
It creates this weird energy.

212
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,440
It's not good.

213
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,640
And often it'll result in sort of like these shadow IT projects where somebody who knows

214
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,720
just enough to be dangerous will help everybody get set up on Dropbox or something like that.

215
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,280
And then you walk in one day and discover your users are all violating your policy.

216
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,160
Collide does things differently.

217
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,500
Instead of forcing changes on users, collide sends them security recommendations via Slack.

218
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,520
Collide will automatically notify your team when their devices are insecure and then give

219
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:29,440
them a step by step instruction on how to solve the problem.

220
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,680
And by reaching out to employees via a friendly Slack DM and educating them about company

221
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,880
policies, collide can help you build a culture in which everyone contributes to security

222
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,920
because everyone understands how and why to do it.

223
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,760
And for IT admins, collide provides a single dashboard that lets you monitor the security

224
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,200
of your entire fleet.

225
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,800
Maybe they're on a Mac, maybe they're on Windows, or maybe they're on Linux.

226
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,060
Yep, you can manage it all and see at a glance which employees have their disk encrypted,

227
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:01,120
their OS up to date, a password manager installed, and it just makes it easy to prove compliance

228
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,120
to yourself, your auditors, leadership, customers, whoever it be.

229
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,260
So that's collide, user centered, cross platform and security for teams that Slack.

230
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,780
You can meet your compliance goals by putting users first.

231
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,820
So visit collide.com slash land to find out how.

232
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,680
And if you follow that link and you sign up, even for just the you know, the old free activated

00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:25,160
trial there, they're going to give you a goodie bag that includes a free t shirt.

234
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,300
So you don't even have to bump into us on the meetup to get some free swag.

235
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,660
You just go to collide.com slash land.

236
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:44,560
Well, it's finally here, Linux 6.0 has been released.

237
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,920
After a rather funny back and forth debating if this latest version should be called 5.20

238
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
or just 6.0.

239
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:58,800
And while it's not quite as ambitious as it once looked, 6.0 does bring many new features

240
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:06,680
from hardware to software, AMD and Intel hardware in particular have seen many additions.

241
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:14,560
Boy have they that is impressive, but there was another really big finally in this release.

242
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,520
The Raspberry Pi V3D kernel driver is in version 6.0.

243
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,080
Thank you, Linus.

244
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,160
It's also fantastic to see some improvements to XFS is scalability.

245
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,540
Love that file system.

246
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:33,720
We're also seeing a batch of new IOU ring optimizations and a new IOU ring block driver

247
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,880
for user space.

248
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,320
And just in time for fedora to take us away.

249
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,960
We now have an H264 and HVAC media user space API that's been promoted to stable.

250
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,400
Oh, don't worry, though, Chris, with the many vert IO improvements that landed in 6.0.

251
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,840
I'm sure you'll be able to emulate some desktop that can play back basic media files.

252
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,920
But hey, maybe you're doing it on a clevo machine, in which case your issues with touchpad

253
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,960
and keyboard being messed up after suspending, well, that's now fixed.

254
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:12,000
Also in 6.0, butterFS users get the send protocol V2.

255
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If you're not familiar, butterFS send and receive functionality generates a stream of

256
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,120
changes between two sub volume snapshots, something that's super handy for taking incremental

257
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,520
backups.

258
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:28,160
The V2 protocol update adds support for directly reading and writing compressed data, which

259
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,660
means no decompression on the send side and no compression needed on the receive side,

260
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,000
at least if there's support on both ends.

261
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,880
ButterFS with Linux 6.0 also now shows commit stats via sysfs, it's got various patches

262
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:51,260
for zoned storage, and another big finally here, fixes for RAID 5 and 6.

263
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,880
That's great to see.

264
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,040
And we are just scratching the surface of what is new in 6.0.

265
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,880
It's impressive to say this is a banner hardware release is putting like a mild tone on how

266
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,640
much updates are in here.

267
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,260
And don't worry, because we're not done.

268
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:16,440
We already are following 6.1, which includes even more butterFS improvements and amongst

269
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,480
a whole bunch of other things.

270
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,840
The one that's going to get all the headlines, initial Rust support is confirmed for version

271
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,760
6.1.

272
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,960
So yeah, we'll be keeping an eye on all of that and everything else in the world of Linux

273
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
and open source.

274
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:36,000
So go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get every single episode.

275
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,120
And linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to keep in touch and send us your butterFS

276
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,220
snapshots.

277
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,480
And this is the last Linux action news from the road.

278
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,360
If you're curious what we've been up to and how our trip to NASA's JPL went, well,

279
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,360
don't miss Linux Unplugged 478.

280
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,920
And we'll be back next week with an in-studio Chris and all the latest Linux and open source

281
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,920
news.

282
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,960
Thanks for joining us.

283
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:19,560
And that's all the news for this week.
