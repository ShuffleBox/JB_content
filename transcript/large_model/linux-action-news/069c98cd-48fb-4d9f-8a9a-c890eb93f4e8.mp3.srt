00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,180
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,640
This is episode 55, recorded on May 27th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,640
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,640
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,760
We have so many things to get into, including some game changing technologies.

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,320
When's the last time you heard me say that?

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,280
Well, we're going to start this week with some good old releases.

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,760
Yeah, OpenSUSE Leap 15 is being released, hot on the heels of version 42.3.

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,720
What?

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,840
That naming system doesn't make any sense.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,060
Yeah, well, release numbers aside, this is the next major release of OpenSUSE Leap.

13
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:53,120
This is version 15, as Joe just said, and it's based on the enterprise grade SLES.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,560
And it brings in that new partitioner, and it also moves to firewall D, as well as introduces

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,040
a new system role, a classic server or a transactional server role.

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,040
Here's what's really neat.

17
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,000
When you go transactional server, you go to a read only root file system.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,320
And when you're booting Leap up, say maybe you're troubleshooting, there is an option

19
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,480
now to boot Leap in read only mode.

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,460
Yeah, I was only kind of joking about the numbers there.

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:20,840
It's the reason that it's changed to 15 is to sync it up with the enterprise version

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,800
SLES, which is going to be coming out in a few months, and that's going to be 15.

23
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,440
And what jumped out at me as being the most significant change is that you're going to

24
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:37,360
be able to upgrade from OpenSUSE 15 to SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 if you want to start paying

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
them.

26
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,840
So it's kind of like giving you the first hit free and getting you sucked in with OpenSUSE,

27
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,960
and then now it's going to be trivial to upgrade to the enterprise version, which I think is

28
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,640
a pretty good strategy from them.

29
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,600
I think this might be a better take on the CentOS Red Hat Enterprise model.

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,260
So I've been in situations myself where I went in for a client, and they had a bunch

31
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,580
of CentOS servers they installed, and over time they ended up becoming very valuable

32
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,640
to the business.

33
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,920
And now the conversation starts, how do we sneaky upgrade these things to RHEL and then

34
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,100
get support for them?

35
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,260
And you start looking at swapping out repositories, and it is possible, but it's dodgy.

36
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:22,040
And now you have from SUSE an official path, hey, you want to try out Leap as a really

37
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,040
powerful SLE based workstation, and now you've decided that either on your server or your

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,200
workstation that it's worth paying for.

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,160
Here is an official upgrade path to the enterprise supported, we'll give you a support contract

40
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,060
version of SUSE.

41
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,360
That's a good strategy.

42
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,160
Embrace that behavior of your users.

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,340
Yeah, and I like the fact that there's only one installation image, and you can just pick

44
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,880
whether you want a desktop version or the server version or the new transactional update

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
server.

46
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,920
I gave Leap 15 a kick of the old tires for this episode of Linux Action News, and I was

47
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,400
both impressed and a little surprised by a couple of things.

48
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,180
I'll start with the things that I was a little lukewarm on.

49
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,040
The installer, while competent, feels to me of a bygone era.

50
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,600
It probes my FireWire devices.

51
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,480
Before I go anywhere in the installer, I have to configure my network interface.

52
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,980
I feel like the installer is making me do tasks that the kernel's already figured out

53
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,760
and done the work for.

54
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,000
Yet we're still giving me a UI to manage it.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,880
It's obviously detected my network interface.

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,520
It obviously is detecting my FireWire and USB ports.

57
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,140
Why do we need to set them all up and probe them?

58
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,360
Try to get an IP address.

59
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,640
If the IP address isn't assigned by a DHCP server, then prompt the user to configure

60
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,080
the network interface.

61
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,880
But instead it starts with that.

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,900
When I open up the update manager, the first thing I get is an error message about my missing

63
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,720
CD ISO image or media.

64
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
It's awkward.

65
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,600
It's Linux of the past.

66
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,220
But then there's a bunch of forward-thinking things that are built in, like the way it

67
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,640
manages your disk.

68
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,660
It uses XFS and ButterFS pretty intelligently, and it's mixed throughout.

69
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:06,000
And you will not find a more polished from boot to desktop experience.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,800
Nobody nails it like SUSE.

71
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,560
Before the grub menu selection even comes up, they've beat everyone else at the game.

72
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,180
And then the little loading bar that comes up for loading your kernel and the entire

73
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,160
boot process is so, so slick.

74
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,420
And there's little things they've thought of, little edge cases that they've covered

75
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,280
in Yast and other places that really kind of make you smile.

76
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,920
So it's a kind of a mixed bag for me when it comes to SUSE.

77
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:34,480
I feel the legacy of a Linux distribution that's been around since before Xorg was

78
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,880
automatically configured and before network cards were automatically configured.

79
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,480
I feel that legacy.

80
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,880
But I also can see a future-looking distribution that's thought of things that other distributions

81
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,360
haven't implemented yet.

82
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,960
So with Leap 15, I'm left kind of in this sort of awkward position, but I could definitely

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,320
see it working as a great workstation for a lot of SUSE users and for people that want

84
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,160
something they can install once and keep using for years.

85
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,240
Well, one thing that we will almost certainly be using in the future is LXQt.

86
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,780
And this week LXQt 0.13 was released.

87
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:10,040
And for me, this is the release that makes it absolutely usable.

88
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,000
It was kind of getting there before, but there were a few little things that annoyed me about

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,360
it, but they seem to have all been fixed.

90
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:20,800
And now I can just add it to the list of desktops that I would be happy to use.

91
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,240
Yeah, the other thing that's great about LXQt 0.13.0 is it's now ready for Qt 5.11, which

92
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,020
is a modern version of the Qt toolkit.

93
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,340
And something else they've done that's going to make it easy for distribution maintainers

94
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,840
to sort of add their own polish is they've moved some of the default configs to user

95
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,040
share LXQt, and now distributions can override default settings by putting their configurations

96
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,200
in slash XE slash LXQt.

97
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,320
It seems like a small change, but that's the little seed that gets planted for distributions

98
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,080
to build a great desktop around LXQt.

99
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,040
Well, one of those distributions is Lubuntu, and they are going to be using this by default

100
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,920
in 18.10.

101
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,000
And the daily image that I tried today was working absolutely fine.

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,200
I was really surprised by that.

103
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,040
It's so early on in the cycle, but it already feels ready to me.

104
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,180
And I would highly recommend that you check it out, even if it's only live, because this

105
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:20,100
is potentially going to be a great alternative to Plasma in the Qt world.

106
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,880
And if you want just a very simple workstation desktop environment that's a classic paradigm,

107
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,680
shall we say, then definitely check it out.

108
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,560
I'm more and more interested in minimal desktop setups these days, not necessarily for my

109
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,560
main workstation, but for some of my work systems that just run a couple of applications

110
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,840
24-7.

111
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,960
It feels like a minimal desktop environment that's based on some modern toolkit technology

112
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,640
is the way to go.

113
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:51,000
But that all said, I am not 100% yet sold on LXQt.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,080
I think it's a great project.

115
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,960
I think it's remarkable the progress they've made.

116
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,920
But having loaded Plasma Desktop, like the full-fledged Plasma Desktop on really old

117
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:07,320
hardware that really has no right to perform at all under modern desktop Linux, full Plasma

118
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,160
Desktop did fine.

119
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,960
And I'm going to throw in behind what Jonathan Riddle said in his interview with you in the

120
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,040
recent Late Night Linux Extra.

121
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,960
I think it's surprisingly low resources.

122
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,260
And I think it is a myth from years gone by that the Plasma Desktop is bloated.

123
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,380
And I would actually challenge people to load the Plasma Desktop on old hardware and sit

124
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,000
back and watch how it gracefully degrades itself to a state that you won't even notice

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
it's degraded.

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,600
It still seems like you're getting great features.

127
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,800
It's a modern desktop.

128
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,120
But yet, the CPU and memory usage is surprisingly low.

129
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,560
Well, yeah, that is true.

130
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,680
But competition is always a good thing, isn't it?

131
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,360
And hopefully, if LXQt gains some traction, it will drive Plasma to be even better than

132
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
it is already.

133
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
Yeah.

134
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,320
And like I said, for some systems, like my studio production systems, I want my desktop

135
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,520
environment doing as little as possible.

136
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,240
But I still want it to be modern and have decent features.

137
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,680
And I think LXQt, more than any other project right now, could be hitting that sweet spot.

138
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,840
Well, I don't know about you, but my init system is missing one crucial feature.

139
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,560
And that is the ability to run containerized services.

140
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,920
Well, good news, Joe.

141
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
And this might be the big news of the week.

142
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,520
A new functionality is coming to systemd, as well as a new utility, Portable CTL.

143
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,280
And portable services are going to be an incremental improvement, as Lenart puts it, over traditional

144
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,080
system services, making two new facets of container management actually possible that

145
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,880
you didn't know you needed until you heard it.

146
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,520
Number one, the bundling of applications, i.e. packaging up multiple services, their

147
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,800
binaries and all of their dependencies into a single image, and then running them directly.

148
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,780
Now, this isn't a Docker container.

149
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,080
We're talking about system services here.

150
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,840
It'll have stricter default policies.

151
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,200
This is number two.

152
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,640
And it will be sandboxed.

153
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,920
The primary tool for interfacing with portable services will be the new Portable CTL program.

154
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,220
It's currently shipped in user lib systemd portable CTL.

155
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,480
It's not in your path.

156
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,360
If you have current version of systemd, it's not yet considered officially part of the

157
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
systemd interfaces.

158
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
It is a preview.

159
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,520
Now, don't get too concerned, because portable services are not actually bringing anything

160
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,160
inherently new to the table.

161
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,140
All they're doing is really putting together a set of known concepts in a nicer way that

162
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,840
addresses specific user cases.

163
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,720
So what technically is a portable service, you're going to be hearing more about this.

164
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:30,160
And it's ultimately just an OS tree inside of a directory tree inside of a raw disk image

165
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,600
containing a Linux file system.

166
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,600
That's it.

167
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,080
Now, the tree is called an image, and it can be, quote, attached or detached from a system.

168
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:43,440
When it is attached, the specific systemd units from the image are made available on

169
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
the host system.

170
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,720
Then it pretty much just behaves exactly like a locally installed system service.

171
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,000
When it is detached, these units are then removed from the host, and they leave no artifacts

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,200
around other than like logs and run commands and all your traditional metrics.

173
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,920
Now that image, that OS tree image, it can really be created with any standard Linux

174
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
tool.

175
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,060
There's nothing proprietary.

176
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,640
You just need a little image with some metadata, and you're done.

177
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:14,680
The portable services concept ultimately will not provide a fully isolated environment like

178
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,640
a VM or a potential container does.

179
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,840
Instead, from the beginning, they're more like regular system services that can be controlled

180
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,800
with the same tools and are exposed in the same way that all the infrastructure is.

181
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,120
So that's great, because that means they can be used with the same management utilities

182
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,680
that already exist, which is huge for enterprise.

183
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,200
The main difference is that they use a different root directory than the rest of the system.

184
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,920
So the intention is not to run code in a different isolated world from the host, like a container

185
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:48,200
or a VM would, but to run in the same world, in the same environment as the rest of the

186
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,620
system, but with simply stricter access controls on what the service can see and do.

187
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,840
And lastly, really, the big point of differentiation between a container and a portable service

188
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,320
is they're just regular services.

189
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,640
They will not be running as PID 1 like a Docker container does, but they're just a normal

190
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,120
process on your system.

191
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,840
Well, I've seen a lot of criticism and debate about this.

192
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,040
Feature creep is something that keeps coming up.

193
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,600
A lot of people keep saying that.

194
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,360
Don't you think that this is kind of a bit beyond what an init system should be doing?

195
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,840
And SystemD is growing beyond just an init system and taking over too much of the Linux

196
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,160
stack here.

197
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,120
I've heard people joking about SystemD slash Linux instead of GNU slash Linux.

198
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,920
And this kind of feels more towards that to me.

199
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,200
Yeah, that could be an argument that could be made.

200
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,280
I would say, though, this is getting really back to its core functionality.

201
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,120
This is really about portable inits.

202
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,440
The only thing this is really adding is the ability to have init scripts that are contained

203
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,200
within an image that you can attach and detach with a SystemD command.

204
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,860
That's what's happening here.

205
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,320
It's like when you launch a snap, it's mounting the file system.

206
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
It runs the application.

207
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,880
When you're done, it goes away.

208
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,880
When you attach this portable service, those system files, those SystemD service files,

209
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,120
they just become available to your SystemD installation.

210
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,440
And when you detach it, they go away.

211
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,600
It's just now instead of having to have everything in one directory, you can attach these images.

212
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,520
So it's kind of more back to its core duty.

213
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,880
I don't know, man.

214
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,000
First he came for my audio stack and I said nothing.

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,560
And then he came for my init.

216
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,880
And now he's just coming for even more.

217
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
It just...

218
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,400
Hey, you know, actually, PulseAudio is pretty good these days.

219
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,600
Yeah, to be fair, Pulse has improved dramatically since it was prematurely introduced into most

220
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,680
distros.

221
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,600
LinuxAcademy.com.

222
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,560
Go there to support the Linux Action News program and sign up for a free seven-day trial

223
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,700
of a platform that is built to learn more about Linux.

224
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,080
And not just give you the hard data, but to also help you develop skills and encourage

225
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,400
critical thinking.

226
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,360
That's why they have hands-on, self-paced, in-depth courses that spin up cloud servers

227
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,600
as you need them.

228
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,200
Scenario-based labs give you experience on real servers, and they have full-time instructors

229
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,200
that can help you whenever you get stuck.

230
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,640
I'm packing after this show, and I'm heading down to Texas.

231
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Number one on my list...

232
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,960
Well, it's Texas Linux Fest now, but number two on my list is hanging out.

233
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,440
Maybe number 1.2, and it's in there, is going to Linux Academy.

234
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm very, very excited to stop by Linux Academy's home base and shake some hands, meet some

235
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,540
folks and install some Linux, because this is a company that truly cares about Linux.

236
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,140
That's why I'm making the trip in the first place.

237
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,300
And you can see it throughout.

238
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,600
That's why they're paying for full-time human beings to answer your questions.

239
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,720
That's why they're currently and constantly building new stuff and updating their old

240
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,320
content, always making your subscription more and more valuable.

241
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,880
One of the things I love is that they've created a flashcard system that's forkable by the

242
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,880
community.

243
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,240
They can make flashcards that are better and better and better within the community, and

244
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,500
they share all of it.

245
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,360
It's such a cool system, and it's full of Jupyter Broadcasting members, so go check

246
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
it out.

247
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
LinuxAcademy.com.

248
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:18,240
It's been a pretty bad week for Essential.

249
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,780
That's the company that was founded by Andy Rubin, who, of course, was one of the co-founders

250
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,620
of Android.

251
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,280
They put out one phone last year.

252
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,880
It didn't do excellently.

253
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,960
There were promises of other devices, like a home assistant and add-ons for the phone,

254
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,760
clip-on cameras, that sort of thing.

255
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:42,620
And now it looks like the next phone that they were going to bring out has been canceled,

256
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,080
and maybe the company's going to go up for sale.

257
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,800
And obviously, they're putting on a brave face and trying to say that everything's fine.

258
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Don't worry.

259
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,120
But it doesn't look good for them, does it?

260
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,120
No, it really doesn't.

261
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,640
In fact, two different media outlets are reporting this.

262
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,000
Essential is kind of denying with a non-denial.

263
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,640
But Bloomberg, the one we have linked in the show notes, linuxactionnews.com 55, says that

264
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,400
current discussions are focused on a sale of the entire company, including its patent

265
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:17,680
portfolio, hardware products, like the original smartphone and the upcoming smartphone device,

266
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,800
and the camera attachment for the phone that had been teased since the first phone.

267
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,240
All of that to be sold.

268
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,400
You have to ask the question, what does this mean for startups in the Android world?

269
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Have they just done it wrong?

270
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,720
I mean, you look at something like OnePlus, and they are going from strength to strength.

271
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,800
They've recently put out their OnePlus 6, and that seems to be getting really good reviews

272
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,880
and everything.

273
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,340
Did he just start out with too much hype in the first place with Essential?

274
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,240
Is that what has caused this problem?

275
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,800
Yeah, I think that is definitely true.

276
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,880
I reserve judgment still on the OnePlus.

277
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,120
I would love to get some real numbers on how they're doing as a company.

278
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,120
And it seems like everybody, like yourself, always says the OnePlus is such a great product.

279
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,800
And then I'm in several Telegram groups, and I'll hear people talk about how, oh, yeah,

280
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,480
the camera never works, or this has always been a problem with mine.

281
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,540
Or it seems like there's a lot of little quality control issues that are never surfaced in

282
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,540
these reviews.

283
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,000
But when you own a OnePlus for more than a year, little things seem to creep up.

284
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,440
And I've just heard a lot of reports of that.

285
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,400
Her own one and myself could be completely wrong, but I've definitely heard a lot of

286
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,400
that.

287
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,960
And when I look at how the Essential phone did it, I can't think of anybody else doing

288
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
it right.

289
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,800
We have this love letter over on xtadevelopers.com to the Essential, and they talk about some

290
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,840
of the things Essential got right.

291
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,560
And it looks like they nailed it.

292
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,440
A, be updating, yes.

293
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,520
Full trouble support, yes.

294
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,240
Direct unlock sales from Essential or Amazon, boom, right when you buy it.

295
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,840
No obnoxious branding on the device.

296
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,200
And you can even get early builds of the OS before they've shipped them, if you want to

297
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,640
run them, directly from Essential.

298
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,960
How more can you nail it for a high-end Android phone for the enthusiast?

299
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,900
Yeah, it's kind of like the old Nexus phones, isn't it?

300
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,560
It's pretty much stock Android, very developer-friendly.

301
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,560
You'd think that they would have sold just hundreds of thousands, millions of these,

302
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,760
but they just haven't sold those numbers.

303
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,520
And don't forget that this was the first phone that shipped with the notch, which now you're

304
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,200
going to struggle to buy a high-end phone without a notch this year.

305
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Right.

306
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,320
And honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if Apple or Samsung started shipping one of their flagship

307
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,500
phones with ceramic very soon, and the Essential beat them to it by years.

308
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,600
If you recall, it's made out of ceramic and titanium.

309
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:36,040
I mean, the thing is designed beautifully.

310
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:41,760
It's got Andy Rubin behind it, and yet it appears they may have only sold 20,000 devices.

311
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,120
Yeah, I would have thought they would have sold a lot more than that, but I suppose it

312
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,800
was quite expensive when it came out, although the price did drop after a few months significantly.

313
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,180
And so again, I thought they would have sold more then, but maybe people just don't really

314
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,520
want to take a chance on the first generation of these things.

315
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,500
So we'll definitely have to keep an eye on this one, I think, because I think over the

316
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,360
next week or two, we're going to see a lot more details coming out about this and whether

317
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,240
they're actually going to be able to sell the company.

318
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,400
The next few weeks will be the most revealing.

319
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,120
What happens to Essential?

320
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,240
And I think this is a good moment to just ask, is there much of an enthusiast market?

321
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,680
Because low cost devices with great distribution are selling.

322
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,520
Yeah, those low end phones do seem to sell in pretty well.

323
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,120
But if a vast are to be believed, then some of them are being shipped with malware pre

324
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,520
installed on them, which is pretty terrible, including ZTE phones.

325
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:42,120
And as we know, ZTE are not in great shape at the moment, thanks to the US government.

326
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,560
Yeah, also Arcos and my phone.

327
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,160
And this doesn't surprise me at all.

328
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,320
I wish it did.

329
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,360
We've seen this a lot.

330
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,440
And it almost always goes down like this.

331
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,280
It's a two part app.

332
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,520
First of all, it consists of just the dropper part, just this small part that just looks

333
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
normal.

334
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
There's nothing malicious about it.

335
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,840
It goes out to the internet, it checks on some HTTP servers, maybe, but that's it.

336
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,880
No big deal.

337
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,920
So it passes automated scans.

338
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,900
And then once the system's active, and the smart ones, they wait a little while.

339
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,880
But once the system's active by the end user, it launches in the background, and it downloads

340
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,920
the payload.

341
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,320
And the payloads all kinds of fun things, perhaps something that exploits the latest

342
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,400
flaw in Android, which the latest flaw could be something that's three years old.

343
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,960
Or perhaps it's something that downloads a crypto miner, and it tries to burn through

344
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,120
your battery life to mine Monero.

345
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,880
It's a range of functionality that these things do.

346
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,560
And they often are almost undetectable by the user, they might not be in the launcher.

347
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,600
And the only way you could even see if they're installed is if you go into the system settings,

348
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,240
and you actually look at the applications through that view.

349
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,080
And a lot of times on the system, there's nothing really left behind that seems too

350
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,600
obvious because they'll name them something after like a game asset file, or an image

351
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
file.

352
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,240
So you can't really tell even by browsing your file system.

353
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,720
From time to time, they'll leave little XML manifest files around that contain information

354
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,840
about what URL to download from.

355
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,240
And in the case of the malware that was shipping on the ZTE, Arcos, and my phones, the author

356
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:14,520
had actually hard coded the URL to get the payload, which is like the laziest, most basic

357
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,540
way to do this kind of thing.

358
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,520
But Avast found that, and they were able to build some metrics around that.

359
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,900
And then from that, they were able to find it on a bunch of these phones.

360
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,960
What it really comes down to is just a lack of quality control from these companies because

361
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,800
they pump them out so cheaply, the margins are so small, that they just don't have time

362
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:39,640
to check all the code that they're getting from third parties, which you do get, you

363
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,080
would hope at least, with the higher end flagship phones.

364
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,480
And it's not really surprising at this low end.

365
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,140
You just kind of wish that the phone industry would have learned the lessons of the PC industry

366
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,960
because we've seen this same thing happen there with Windows devices that are racing

367
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
to the bottom for price.

368
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,900
Even recently, Lenovo had the Superfish exploit that was shipped on thousands of computers

369
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,640
that essentially had malware built in.

370
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,600
This is a continuing problem that the industry knew about, but yet continues to replicate

371
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,360
those mistakes because, I suppose, the economics of the industry.

372
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,560
It does remind us all, though, that if you can, if you're technically capable of, it

373
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,520
might just be best to replace those images that these devices come with with something

374
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,520
that you trust.

375
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,160
Well, that's exactly what I did with my old Chromebook.

376
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,640
I installed gallium OS, but maybe I won't need to run gallium OS in the future in order

377
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,680
to run Linux applications on this old Chromebook of mine.

378
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,680
After Google I.O., we thought that this was going to be limited to really high end Chromebooks.

379
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,840
And they said available on pixels soon and things like that.

380
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,720
But thanks to an issue that was found on Chromium's public bug tracker, it appears that this new

381
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,560
Linux apps on Chrome OS functionality won't be limited to just the newest highest end

382
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
devices.

383
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,640
Now, there was some grounds for us thinking it might be because the Linux apps on Chrome

384
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,320
OS require Linux kernel 4.4.

385
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,960
But in this issue on Chromium's bug tracker, we see work is being done to back work features

386
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,600
from 4.4 and some of the modules, specifically VSOC, which is required for all of this to

387
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,560
work, to Linux kernel 3.14, which happens to be the kernel that a couple of popular

388
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,760
Samsung Chromebooks run.

389
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,560
Apparently, Samsung wants in on the Linux app goodness on their Chromebooks.

390
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:29,480
And so work has begun on Google's part to back port the stuff from 4.4 to 3.14.

391
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:36,320
So if your Chromebook runs kernel 3.14 or newer, perhaps possibly, it may also get access

392
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,320
to these Linux apps.

393
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,560
You may not have to buy a thousand dollar pixel book.

394
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,960
That's suddenly going to make the used market for those Chromebooks more appealing, isn't

395
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
it?

396
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
Yeah, definitely.

397
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,400
I mean, we don't really know the extent of the back porting.

398
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,920
So we'll have to figure out what that is.

399
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,240
Some kernel modules or platform generations just may not make the cut because they just

400
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,600
are not fast enough or they can't run the right kernel.

401
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,680
But nonetheless, this news does mean that older Chromebooks will not necessarily suffer

402
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,640
from obsolescence just yet.

403
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,480
So that used market did just get a little more valuable.

404
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,360
It's just not quite time to pull the trigger on a Chromebook yet, I think.

405
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,240
Yeah, it's going to be a while, as we talked about last week.

406
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,880
But as always, when that news lands or anything like it in Linux or the open source world,

407
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,280
we'll tell you about it right here on the show.
