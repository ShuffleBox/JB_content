00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News episode 128 recorded on October 20th, 2019.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,400
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,400
And I'm Drew.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,400
Hello, Drew.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,400
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,440
Joe is away at Ogg Camp this week.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,440
He'll be back next week and Drew's filling in.

8
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:25,440
And Drew, we start off with a huge new release from Canonical, Ubuntu 19.10 is out.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,720
Yeah, and it's pretty great too.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,880
I've been using it for the past week or so in the beta and really, this is just a super

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,600
solid release.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,360
I am astounded by how polished everything is, even when it was in beta.

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,720
Gnome Shell has reached just a new level of performance and 19.10 is one of the first

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,420
distros out of the gate to showcase that.

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,660
But also, you have your official flavors this release that are really looking good.

16
00:00:53,660 --> 00:01:01,360
One of my favorites, Ubuntu Mate 19.10 goes up to the Mate Desktop 1.22.2, Evolution replaces

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:07,800
Thunderbird, MPV comes in to replace VLC, and there's a new updated Brisk menu as well.

18
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:13,680
But Joe's favorites, Ubuntu also gets a great update, Budgie also, Kubuntu, all around,

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,800
it's looking really great for the flavors and for the main distro.

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,000
Because really, in a sense, it's getting everything positioned and ready for 2004, the next big

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
LTS.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,560
Well, yeah, they're getting everything all polished up and ready for their long term

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,080
support release and is going to have at least five years of support.

24
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,920
So you want to make sure that everything that goes into it is going to be rock solid.

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,000
Because with the exception of adding in backport PPAs, that's going to be what they're going

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,080
to be running for at least five years.

27
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah, and perhaps even longer with extended support could be up to a decade in some cases.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,880
The most notable new feature in 1910 is obviously support for ZFS on route.

29
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,320
It's a checkbox in the graphical installer.

30
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,160
It is heavily couched as experimental in all caps in the installer.

31
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,480
So they really want you to know that you are taking your data into your own hands when

32
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,600
you try it.

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,280
But under the hood, they're working on some really sophisticated layout options that as

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,080
you would expect, accommodate not just the desktop, but also different kinds of server

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,280
deployments, some that are automated that are clustered, as well as putting a layer

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,540
in there called ZSYS, which will take care of a few of the fundamentals and works with

37
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,600
things like a patched version of grub that allow you to boot directly from ZFS on your

38
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,800
root partition.

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,120
But even further from that down the road, you may be able to select snapshots of your

40
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,960
system like you currently select kernels after you do an update.

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,420
Something goes wrong, you reboot, select a two hour earlier snapshot, everything's right

42
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,680
back to where it was.

43
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,680
Right.

44
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,700
And this is a feature that they are trying to borrow from the BSD world, something called

45
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:08,020
boot environments, where you literally select the snapshot that ZFS took prior to you doing

46
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:14,880
some crazy system upgrade or really just anything that could be a breaking change and allows

47
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,940
you to just essentially roll back to the snapshot that you had before.

48
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,580
It's a really good technology and I'm really looking forward to them integrating that into

49
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,580
the system.

50
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,680
I think it's going to be a game changer for Ubuntu down the line.

51
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,460
Well, the idea would be that when 2004 ships, things like kernel updates and major system

52
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,840
updates are no longer going to take your system out.

53
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,840
It's going to make that much safer in an enterprise environment to deploy those updates.

54
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,120
So there's a lot of really important things there, but there's so many other benefits

55
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,480
like really good file system compression that can actually improve boot time and file read

56
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,360
access, incredible data management options.

57
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,160
I couldn't do it proper justice, but Jim Salter does in TechSnap 4.14.

58
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,600
Go to TechSnap.Systems slash 4.14 and listen to rooting for ZFS.

59
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,280
I think one of my favorite moments in that episode was when Jim explained how snapshots

60
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,000
work in a way that is so totally understandable and it really clicked in my head why it doesn't

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,200
consume tons and tons of disk space and why in some circumstances a snapshot can happen

62
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,520
so quickly and how you really could just make it part of a package update script.

63
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,640
So such a great episode TechSnap.Systems slash 4.14.

64
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,360
Once you get 1910 installed, it is important to go ahead and do a full upgrade because

65
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,320
there is an important kernel fix that was released after those images were spun.

66
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,680
Yeah, it's an embarrassing bug too because it reminds me of a bug on Windows way back

67
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
in the day where you could just blue screen a Windows system by sending it some packets

68
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,960
of data.

69
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,760
This is on that level and it took a little while for people to catch on to this bug because

70
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,720
initially it was reported as a WireGuard bug and then we came to realize it's actually

71
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,000
a kernel bug in the IPv6 stack and yeah, it's an issue.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,160
It's worth upgrading because people can just crash your machine.

73
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
Yeah, definitely.

74
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,080
You want to keep those machines nice and safe.

75
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,680
We gave our first impressions in Linux Unplugged last week and since then we've been benchmarking

76
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:20,380
a ZFS 1910 system versus an Extended 4 1910 system and how it performs in low memory conditions

77
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,840
and just on like an average SSD, not like a super nice crazy MV&E, but we went and got

78
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,720
like an EvoDrive that we've had for a couple of years and in that batch of testing one

79
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,360
of the things I've discovered is that Canonical did spin an image for the Raspberry Pi 4,

80
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,640
the 32-bit and a 64-bit.

81
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:45,880
As we record the 64-bit version has an issue with, well, USB devices don't work, but it's

82
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,960
reported and it's in their bug tracker.

83
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,280
32-bit for my testing does not suffer, so the 32-bit image, you put that on Raspberry

84
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:58,480
Pi 4 and you've got 1910 running on this tiny little arm board and that's going to be a

85
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:05,240
really interesting story as well as 2004 comes out and we have a lot more types of arm devices

86
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,680
on the market including the Pi 4, but also including Amazon's new bare metal arm instances.

87
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,220
Yeah, this looks really cool.

88
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:19,440
They're calling it the A1 family and it is powered by Graviton processors.

89
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,320
I love these names, Drew.

90
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
I know, right?

91
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,920
I mean a Graviton processor?

92
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,960
That sounds like something that would be in Star Trek.

93
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,440
Yeah, it totally does.

94
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,240
Graviton is saying that it's a great fit for scale-out workloads including web front-ends,

95
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,920
containerized microservices or caching fleets.

96
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,480
Right, and in some workloads they say you'll get a 45% cost savings because they're running

97
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,480
these machines for less money and for the right applications it could make a lot of

98
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:52,400
sense, including developers who are starting development on ARM can now move that ARM code

99
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,840
up to machines running on EC2.

100
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:01,480
This is a pretty big deal when Amazon starts doing this because it's one thing when Joe's

101
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:09,460
hosting says, oh, by the way, I have ARM servers, but for Amazon to put this out in AWS where

102
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:14,720
you can spin it up in minutes, this is a big boost for ARM.

103
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
Right.

104
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,840
When you are on EC2 you're also part of their entire stack of their monitoring and their

105
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,360
messaging their entire ecosystem and the thing that's nice about having this on Metal is

106
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,560
you run your own distro and they write even in their announcement about it just run a

107
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,720
distribution like Ubuntu, Red Hat, Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux, Enterprise Server or Debian

108
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,840
and of course Amazon's Linux 2 is available as well and you tie that in with their whole

109
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,800
orchestration and management platform and if you're a shop there's a lot of them out

110
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,820
there these days that has nearly their entire data center on Amazon.

111
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,160
This is just now one more system you can deploy and I think it's going to be a big boom for

112
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,200
ARM code on Linux as well which is really still not quite up to parity with the x86

113
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
counterpart.

114
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,720
That's true but changes are coming and Docker has announced support for ARM based architectures

115
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,100
with their Docker Enterprise Edition.

116
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:12,000
So while it feels like ARM support has been growing slowly it is really starting to get

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,800
there and I think the future holds of just a world of possibilities for ARM.

118
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,920
Yeah imagine like the edge network stuff a lot of enterprise-grade applications that

119
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,480
are just doing a couple of things here and there and they don't need an entire stack

120
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:31,120
but that hasn't necessarily translated to big profits for IBM in the enterprise in fact

121
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:37,560
IBM has missed their estimates even as Red Hat was added didn't really offset the declines

122
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,080
their total revenue was down 3.9% from a year earlier.

123
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:51,120
Analysts had forecast 18.2 billion dollars and IBM got close but just missed it and doesn't

124
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,880
really seem like Red Hat made a huge difference does it?

125
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,240
No it doesn't but I kind of have to wonder how quickly did they expect the Red Hat purchase

126
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,320
to really change things and turn it around at IBM.

127
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,080
These kinds of acquisitions are big business and they do take time to really start taking

128
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
effect.

129
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,920
Absolutely in fact in a way like they should be getting a pat on the back for it not being

130
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,720
worse during a merger like everything's crazy you know people are figuring out their stuff

131
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,800
I mean I can only imagine our merger had lots of little details we had to sort out and we

132
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,600
were a tiny little company and this is Red Hat.

133
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,960
There's so many things they have to sort there's so many additional meetings the cognitive

134
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:36,280
overhead of a merger at this scale is massive and so I mean in one way you could spin this

135
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,880
and say I'm surprised that they weren't much worse but I think it does also represent what

136
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,680
kind of a small impact Red Hat's revenues make to IBM's bottom line because this is

137
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,760
really the first time we've seen Red Hat included in the results since the 2018 purchase so

138
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,440
like we see the first results of this in this quarter and it's kind of well it's nothing

139
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,800
yet it really is nothing yet but I think you're right time will tell won't it?

140
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,320
It will and to be fair Red Hat's revenue was up from what it was projected at this year.

141
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,880
Realistically I think that the Red Hat merger is showing promise I think we just need to

142
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,560
give it a little more time yeah and in fact Chief Financial Officer Jim Cavanaugh said

143
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,920
in an interview that he expects IBM will be back to a sustained level of revenue growth

144
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,240
in 2020.

145
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,840
Yeah look we love to give IBM a hard time a little bit because they're sort of the suits

146
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,640
but there's other factors here that are maybe things that we don't track as clearly and

147
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,000
that's things like foreign currency and how the shifts in the foreign currency markets

148
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,400
can just affect IBM's overall results or their global IT company starts having poor performance

149
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,400
in Ireland for the last few quarters and it has impacted their results and none of it

150
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,080
has anything to do with Red Hat or what their success is in the cloud.

151
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,440
Really and you also have to take into account that IBM is massive they have all kinds of

152
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,800
departments doing all kinds of different things and if any one of them underperforms from

153
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,600
what they were projected that does affect the total company's bottom line.

154
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,080
You know Drew when you say all that global markets and currencies and all of this it

155
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,180
man it really strikes me how far open source software has come like it's powering massive

156
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,800
massive businesses now and time really does tell all stories so we'll see where this

157
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:31,200
goes and now we have an update with Samsung's grand attempt to put Linux on DeX and it's

158
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
not good.

159
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,680
Yeah bad news coming from Samsung they sent out an email to all of the Linux for DeX beta

160
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,920
participants saying that they are ending support for Linux on DeX.

161
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,560
Now if you're listening you're going what the heck is DeX guys well this debuted back

162
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:51,220
in 2017 with the Samsung Galaxy S8 it let you get a desktop mode UI when you put it

163
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,100
in their special DeX station which had connectors on the back of it and then later with the

164
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,480
launch of the Galaxy Note 9 they made it work with any HDMI to USB-C type cable which meant

165
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,360
you didn't need the dock anymore and they also started testing Linux on DeX which enabled

166
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,320
the user to get a full-fledged Linux desktop running on the smartphone in DeX mode specifically

167
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,480
Linux on DeX supported a modified Ubuntu 1604 LTS for ARM 64.

168
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,600
Yeah and it looks like that program is going away with Android 10 they have noted that

169
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Linux on DeX will not be supported on Android 10 beta once you update your device to Android

170
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,640
OS 10 you will not be able to perform a version rollback to Android Pi if you decide to update

171
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:43,480
your device to Android 10 beta we recommend backing up before updating.

172
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,400
Yeah this is not going to be a thing anymore.

173
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,960
They decided not to graduate it to a product you know they tried it out as a beta and they

174
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:56,640
said now we're not going to do it to be honest I never really saw the appeal I mean if you

175
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,760
look at me I might be the perfect ideal candidate to buy something like this like I like getting

176
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,880
me a fancy smartphone I love the idea of a mobile usable workstation that's in my pocket

177
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,580
I'd be willing to invest in a dock I mean a hell I bought Thunderbolt docks I'll buy

178
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:20,360
a DeX dock even if I had to or a USB C to HDMI cable with a Bluetooth keyboard I do that

179
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,440
but I think just instinctively I knew it was never really going to be up to my expectations

180
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,560
and performance and I've come to a new a new place with how I use my mobile devices and

181
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,160
how I use my desktops and how I divvy up those tasks and I'm pretty comfortable with it.

182
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:43,280
I'm kind of of two minds here I think it's a really great idea the whole idea of convergence

183
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:49,640
of being able to walk around with your computer on your cell phone you plug it into a workstation

184
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,920
and all of a sudden you've got your desktop so you could travel from home to the office

185
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:00,160
and have the same computer without having to lug around a laptop or anything like that

186
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,360
it's a really cool idea but I think we also have to recognize that it's 2019 now and almost

187
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:12,400
2020 and more and more people are doing more stuff on mobile.

188
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,840
The mobile devices battery lives haven't significantly improved the OS is still aren't really quite

189
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:22,040
fast enough like you don't have enough horsepower to use it as a desktop apps that are designed

190
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,720
for mobile use like a banking app that's a mobile app that makes sense but hooking up

191
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,640
to a whole screen I just I don't think it's there I mean do you really think it's you

192
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,240
really think it is honestly I don't think it's there now but I think the potential to

193
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:42,240
make something great out of it really would be there if we hadn't seen such a global shift

194
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,260
towards mobile only computer over the last few years really I think that's what's killing

195
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:55,440
Linux on decks and things like Ubuntu touch which had a very similar idea but as we all

196
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,080
know that's one that we can say rest in peace to okay I see what you're saying you're saying

197
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:05,480
mobile has gotten competent enough that you don't need to snap it into a desktop mode

198
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,200
that's right I mean just look at the success of you know Chromebooks they're not running

199
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,680
full on Linux and granted you can get Linux apps running on them but for the most part

200
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,840
people are using them like bigger cell phones what's funny about this is we're both skeptics

201
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:27,620
but for totally opposite reasons see my argument is the desktop has stayed competitive has

202
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:32,760
gotten better and faster in fact in a lot of ways it's better than it's ever been when

203
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:39,120
you get a like a full rise in system and or even just a system with an AMD GPU and you

204
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,440
can run Wayland and you have to you didn't have to install a single driver and you get

205
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,600
full 3d acceleration it's really getting to be the next level now in the Linux desktop

206
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,080
it's it's better than it has been at any point in time that I've ever been doing this and

207
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,800
the hardware is getting good again as well and so are laptops they're getting really

208
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,400
competitive again Intel and AMD are back at each other's throats again like I feel like

209
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,980
the desktop and the laptop space is more competitive and has moved forward more in the last couple

210
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,600
of years than it has in the instance mobile became a thing and so in a sense it hasn't

211
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,240
stood still is just going slow for a little bit now it's in gear and so I think the gaps

212
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,660
getting wider again and I think you're right about that I just think that the train has

213
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:27,040
left the station as far as being able to really capture I don't want to say desktop usage

214
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,840
it's like that good enough usage though where it's like it's fast enough I can do everything

215
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:37,960
I need usage yeah absolutely and for most people mobile or mobile like experiences are

216
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:42,200
good enough what do most people want they want to check their email they want to browse

217
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,520
the web it's the people like us the people who like to mess with computers who really

218
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,320
love this stuff right yeah all right I agree and I I think that's why the Linux for decks

219
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,320
didn't quite click for me because it was clearly going after the more advanced user being Linux

220
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,320
and the fact that you had to go get this thing and install it on your phone and even know

221
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,320
that it had this capability to begin with all of those probably put you in a more advanced

222
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,040
category and then when you get to that category well we got a whole heck of requirements you

223
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,240
know we got a whole bunch of requirements the first thing is somebody's gonna want to

224
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,680
put i3 on that thing and the packages wouldn't be available they'd be out oh yeah absolutely

225
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:23,340
but you know all is not lost there is Maru OS still out there and they're still targeting

226
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:29,540
convergence so you know people who do still have that dream where you can walk around

227
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,480
with your computer in your pocket and just connect it up to something and get going it's

228
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:41,400
not completely dead yet well drew my dream is software distribution that's truly safe

229
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:47,600
we're not there yet it looks like a crypto jacking worm was found inside images on DockerHub

230
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,880
yeah this is bad news for DockerHub and the Docker project at large having this kind of

231
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:59,280
malware attack the system is not a good thing now to their credit I can't find any of these

232
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,720
Docker images on DockerHub anymore so it does look like they've been pulled but who knows

233
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,220
if they've uploaded some other malicious images under some other name so this graboid malware

234
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,300
works kind of interestingly and kind of wonky at the same time it carries out its worm spreading

235
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:22,080
and crypto jacking by randomly picking three targets on each run iteration it installs

236
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,940
the worm on the first target it stops the miner on the second target and it starts

237
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:32,140
the miner on a third target this procedure leads to a random kind of mining behavior

238
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:36,860
and if a host is compromised the malicious container doesn't necessarily start immediately

239
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,360
so you don't necessarily see anything at boot time that would draw your attention the container

240
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:47,340
runs for a little bit and then the other compromised hosts can randomly stop other mining processes

241
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:54,000
so essentially the miner on every infected host is randomly controlled by all the other

242
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,060
infected hosts and unit 42 the people who discovered the worm said that they really

243
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:07,600
can't determine why the miners are deployed and run and stopped so randomly is it just

244
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,000
bad design or do they have some other goal that we don't necessarily understand yet

245
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,800
palo alto networks has a great breakdown that we will have linked in the show notes at linuxactionnews.com

246
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,380
slash 128 when you look at the overall scale of docker hub this issue still kind of remains

247
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,880
to be a little more on the theoretical edge i know it's even like you know nearly 10,000

248
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,260
image downloads have happened so it's real and that's a lot of people but docker image

249
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:38,420
deployments are on the scale of millions in some cases even billions and just like in

250
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:44,740
the aur there is the theoretical risk which there has been bad stuff in the aur before

251
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:50,900
if you use the entire suite of tools around the software including looking at how many

252
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:57,760
other downloads or in this case polls or looking at the comments or all the other attributes

253
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,740
you can analyze like publishers etc you are able to build a more complete picture and

254
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,760
essentially get a better idea of if you can trust the author or not and you combine that

255
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,720
with industry best practices and it just doesn't really feel like a huge issue to me it's not

256
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,700
one that i worry about on my systems but i'm also willing to put a few minutes of research

257
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,300
into an image before i deploy it on a production system well yeah you absolutely have to if

258
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:29,600
you want to stay secure you can't just trust everything you see out there you want to make

259
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:36,060
sure that your images or software are coming from reputable sources at the very least well

260
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,740
let's talk about the hard time google's been giving free software projects that are attempting

261
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,260
to raise donations two fairly important projects were removed from the play store this week

262
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:52,520
we start with and otp and otp was pulled from the google play store by google after they

263
00:20:52,520 --> 00:21:00,060
introduced a donation button and it cost a bit of a stir this is an open source project

264
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:05,060
that is not necessarily wanting to charge for itself but would like to allow people

265
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:10,220
to give money to it and google says that's not okay i also i kind of don't like this

266
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,820
because in both circumstances the one we're about to talk about and this one these applications

267
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:21,760
improve the android ecosystem security and otp is a fabulous two-factor authentication

268
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,880
app for android and it supports devices down to 4.4 which a lot of developers have abandoned

269
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,040
at this point and it's a solid implementation of a time-based one-time password or other

270
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,100
systems as well you got an hmac based one you can just scan the qr code it automatically

271
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,980
will get all of that set up it's a really nice user experience and the developer is

272
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:47,020
just trying to make it sustainable i completely agree i don't see anything wrong with having

273
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:53,940
some kind of donation service within an app that just lets people give back to a project

274
00:21:53,940 --> 00:22:00,340
especially one as beneficial as and otp or wire guard which was also removed from the

275
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:05,680
google play store for the same thing this is really upsetting because again wire guard

276
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,620
is some really great software personally one of my favorite open source projects in the

277
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:15,900
last couple of years and a similar story here they added a link to wire guard dot com slash

278
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:20,980
donations which we should all go to now that google has forced them to remove it just adding

279
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,740
that link which would open the user's web browser to do a donation google so it was

280
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:32,540
in violation of their payment policy in the google play store yes and both projects are

281
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:39,980
back up on google play now that they've removed their donation links but really how bad is

282
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:45,860
it to have a donation button i mean they're not forcing people to pay for the software

283
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,900
they're not doing anything other than just routing people to a website that asks for

284
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,180
a little bit of money it's really unfortunate especially when you're just talking about

285
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,620
a link that opens the web browser i mean for goodness sakes the ios version has it it's

286
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:04,020
nice and prominent with a little heart emoji in the setting screen and you tap it and it

287
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:09,740
opens up a web browser to their donate page ios has it like it feels like this should

288
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:15,060
be a story about apple and here we're talking about google in my opinion these actions have

289
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,580
elevated f-droid to a whole nother level of prominence in the open source community thank

290
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,780
goodness we have another alternative and one that is friendly to open source because during

291
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:31,660
both of these pollings from the play store f-droid of course kept the apps with the donation

292
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:37,700
links absolutely and i personally think that it shows a lot of backwards thinking on the

293
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,300
part of google with more and more software going towards services like patreon to support

294
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:49,420
themselves we really need to be helping these businesses generate revenue in ways that are

295
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,380
friendly towards the open source community the lead wire guard developer jason donofield

296
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:58,340
commented quote we won't be making any similar changes unless we are certain that we won't

297
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:04,060
be delisted again yeah i couldn't see any way for them to survive if they're not in

298
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:10,960
the play store i mean granted the technology itself would survive in servers and desktops

299
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:18,020
and ios but if people aren't able to take advantage of it on android they're gonna go

300
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:23,580
somewhere else yeah they'll use something that's perhaps proprietary or it's a some

301
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:31,420
weird implementation that spies on them wire guard is good audited free software that implements

302
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:37,100
really good crypto and a great vpn technology and i think as we start to see really solid

303
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,500
commercial solutions wrapped around it it's going to be a no-brainer and eventually it'll

304
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,560
be just a detail you'll get an app that uses wire guard and you'll just have the peace

305
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,740
of mind of knowing that the underlying software is open source and has been reviewed and is

306
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,860
continued to be reviewed and i think that's the real long-term benefit that wire guard

307
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:59,680
offers even average users on android they may not even know they're using it but they'll

308
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:06,000
get something that's good reliable that supports a mobile connection way better than current

309
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:12,060
vpns do with its super easy handling of getting disconnected and reconnected it's just an

310
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,060
up and down of an interface and it it makes it so smooth i could go on and on obviously

311
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,920
i love it and i just think it's critically important that google supports things like

312
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:25,440
two-factor authentication and vpn technologies and pulling these two applications simply

313
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,100
because they had links to donations well it's it's a clear step beyond what even apple would

314
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,700
do and i i just don't know where that leaves us because of the prominence of the play store

315
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,540
it leaves me uncomfortable well when these types of stories break we cover them in linux

316
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:44,080
