00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,320
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News Episode 195, recorded on June 27, 2021.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,320
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,320
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,320
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,320
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,340
We start with the release of Rocky Linux 8.4.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,560
As you may recall, Rocky Linux was one of the first traditional CentOS alternatives

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,940
announced, and this week the gold master of their first release shipped.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:34,660
Rocky Linux 8.4 is binary compatible, of course, with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4, making

10
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,840
it possible to run apps built for Red Hat Enterprise Linux on Rocky Linux, in theory,

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,520
without too much trouble.

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,520
Developers love that.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,960
The Green Obsidian was its code name, also known as Rocky 8.4.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,680
And it's pretty great to see this milestone.

15
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,400
This was one of the first we saw crop up, and now we've seen them reach this very important

16
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
moment.

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,040
The team has a gift as part of this milestone.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,720
There is a migration script that existing RHEL 8.4 users can install and migrate to

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,720
Rocky Linux.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,680
Now, beware, any distribution that's had its core repositories altered, removed, duplicated,

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,280
maybe overwritten, you're going to have a bad time.

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,160
You may just totally have a broke system, so be careful and back up.

23
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,680
And another gotcha could be that Secure Boot is yet to be supported in Rocky 8.4, but the

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,040
good news is there is the team is working on that.

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,200
Clearly, still early days overall for Rocky Linux, and yeah, the team acknowledges that.

26
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,480
But it does seem like a pretty good start and some momentum in community being built

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
here.

28
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,880
Looking back, 8.4 took seven months to go from a newly formed community all the way

29
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:50,100
till today, where we've got a release available, not only for x86, but also ARM 64.

30
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,280
For its users, free community support is available through the Rocky Linux Mattermost, IRC, and

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,520
the forums.

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,480
And if you need something a little bit beyond that, paid commercial support is currently

33
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,400
available through CIQ.

34
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:09,560
Sticking with our theme of commercial support, Ubuntu maker Canonical has announced they'll

35
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,160
support open source Blender on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:23,560
This really all starts, though, back in May of 2020 with the release of Blender 2.83.

37
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:28,760
And with that release, the Blender Foundation announced the start of their long term support

38
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,720
pilot program.

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,320
That's a program aimed at ensuring that long lasting Blender projects can still be executed

40
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,040
using a stable version of Blender that doesn't change out from under them, but still have

41
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,080
that Blender version get some of those critical fixes and patches throughout a two year support

42
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
lifespan.

43
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,200
You can see how handy that could be for a Hollywood production that might be taking

44
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,920
three or four years to actually create some of the visual effects.

45
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,120
That's not uncommon.

46
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,040
Well, just recently, on June 2nd, Blender 2.93 was released.

47
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,080
This is the second release to enter this long term support program by the Blender Foundation.

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,720
And then this week, Canonical announced that they've partnered up with the Blender Foundation

49
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,480
to offer paid enterprise support around the long term support versions of Blender.

50
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,040
Canonical says the support offering will include Blender LTS releases across Linux distributions,

51
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,680
Microsoft Windows and Mac OS.

52
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,600
Canonical's engineers will engage directly with customers to provide comprehensive technical

53
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:36,040
support to users and they go on to say Canonical will manage the entire support process, including

54
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,440
integration with Blender support infrastructure.

55
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,840
And if you're already an Ubuntu Advantage customer, well, this is just one more support

56
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,320
offering baked right in.

57
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:53,200
As for what this new offering might cost, well, the standard 24 by 5 support package

58
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,760
starts at $500 USD per year.

59
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,120
Or if you need advanced coverage, 24x7 support, that's $1000.

60
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:06,020
Yeah, that's for those really demanding directors that need immediate support when something

61
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,520
isn't wrong with VFX.

62
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,960
But honestly, in terms of enterprise price points, well, those really aren't too bad.

63
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,560
Five hundred for the standard, a thousand a year for the high touch plan.

64
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,840
That's actually a pretty good deal.

65
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,120
And it seems like a clever move on Canonical's part.

66
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,040
I could see Blender being really popular with Ubuntu workstations and Ubuntu based workstations.

67
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,060
So what Canonical is doing here is tying all of this together.

68
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,440
And they're also saying at the same time, our engineers are going to handle your cross

69
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,940
platform support issues as well.

70
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,280
Does this mean there are now folks working at Canonical who get paid to just play around

71
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,600
with Blender in between those support calls?

72
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Maybe.

73
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,040
We'll have to watch the job postings and see what comes out.

74
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,320
But in the meantime, Canonical is making a move to be one of the best supported Linux

75
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,840
distributions on the RISC-V platform.

76
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,200
Ubuntu now supports two RISC-V boards from Sci-Fi, the Hi-Fi Unleashed and the Hi-Fi

77
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Unmatched.

78
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,720
Now, of course, we've covered Sci-Fi pretty extensively on the show in the past.

79
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,000
And just recently, they were in the news with rumors that Intel was looking to acquire the

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,800
company.

81
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,160
But in a blog post this week, Canonical wrote, Canonical's team is engaged in an ongoing

82
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,440
process of porting Ubuntu to Hi-Fi boards backed by the Sci-Fi engineering team as part

83
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,760
of a long term collaboration between the two companies.

84
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,960
Canonical goes on to say that RISC-V has a lot of potential and is becoming a competitive

85
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,960
ISA in multiple markets.

86
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,280
And that meant porting Ubuntu to RISC-V to become a reference OS for early adopters was

87
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
kind of a no brainer.

88
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,120
Yeah, at least according to Canonical.

89
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,320
And I see this here, and I think there's a couple of notable words in that quote of theirs,

90
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
ongoing process.

91
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,280
So this is a long term thing.

92
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,280
And they're collaborating.

93
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,080
The two companies are working together.

94
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,840
So you would think that potentially suggests future boards.

95
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,800
There may be some collaboration there.

96
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,640
So right now, practically speaking, there's essentially three Ubuntu images available

97
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,340
for Sci-Fi users.

98
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:09,600
The unleashed supports Ubuntu 21.04 and 20.04, and the unmatched can run 21.04.

99
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,200
Well, just maybe sometime soon, we'll have more RISC-V boards laying around next to our

100
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,880
Raspberry Pis or running in a server somewhere.

101
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,320
And if you're developing for that, seems like at least right now, Ubuntu is probably the

102
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,080
logical choice.

103
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,440
In just a horrifying story that we wanted you to be aware of, Western Digital is recommending

104
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,680
that customers unplug their MyBook Live storage devices from the internet until further notice,

105
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,520
while the company investigates unexplained compromises that may have entirely wiped data

106
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,520
from devices worldwide.

107
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,040
Mass incidents of disk wiping came to light in a thread on Western Digital support forum.

108
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:56,560
To make matters worse, so far, there are no reports of that deleted data later being restored.

109
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,420
The affected model known as MyBook Live uses an ethernet cable to connect to your local

110
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,560
network.

111
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,160
And then from there, users can remotely access their files and make configuration changes

112
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,120
and maybe a whole lot more through Western Digital's cloud infrastructure.

113
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah, and there's a wrinkle in this story, and that is that Western Digital stopped supporting

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,400
the MyBook Live in 2015.

115
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,960
Multiple users reported that the data loss coincided with a factory reset that had been

116
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,600
performed on their devices, and one person posted a log that showed some unexplained

117
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,960
behavior occurring on Wednesday.

118
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,680
This is just unacceptable, and unfortunately, as we record right now, there's just limited

119
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,380
information available, so it makes it really hard for us to make any kind of determination

120
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,880
we can relay to you about what is causing this mass destruction.

121
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,840
Western Digital's statement, well, it kind of implies that maybe customer accounts were

122
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,200
compromised individually, and so it's a onesie-twosie thing, but then the support forums would seem

123
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
to indicate otherwise.

124
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
I don't know.

125
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:00,680
I mean, if this event was triggered by some server-side process on their infrastructure,

126
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,440
I'd have a lot of questions about why that is even possible.

127
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,720
I mean, the stories of people losing their insurance policies or budgets, personal pictures,

128
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,360
business data, that's just rough to read.

129
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,640
If you know anyone that this has happened to, maybe a good moment to try and help if

130
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,880
you can get some sort of self-hosted or Linux-powered solution that they actually have complete

131
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,880
control over, maybe with your help, and one that can't be wiped remotely.

132
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,880
Lino.com.

133
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:46,100
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit towards a new account and support the show.

134
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,600
Our friends at Lino make this possible, and when you go there, it's letting them know

135
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
you heard it right here.

136
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,420
You thank them for supporting us.

137
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,760
And you can try out Linode with $100 for real and see why they are our cloud hosting provider

138
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,760
of choice.

139
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,760
They're fast.

140
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,200
They have a great UI, and they have a ton of features that we love, and 11 data centers

141
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
around the world.

142
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,360
Linode has been doing this since 2003, and over the years, they've slowly built it into

143
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,860
the best place to run virtualized Linux, and they have impressive support for various technologies

144
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,240
you can use to manage your cloud at scale.

145
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,560
You know, like Terraform?

146
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,240
Terraform's well-known and widely used to manage infrastructure as code, and Linode

147
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,680
is making an eBook available that will help you understand the underlying concepts of

148
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,960
how it could be significant for you to leverage your infrastructure.

149
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,600
A free eBook will have that linked in the show notes, but go try them out.

150
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,280
And if you ever run into any trouble, they're fancy, super great, totally the best support

151
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
ever.

152
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
And I mean it.

153
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
They really are great.

154
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,640
With 24-7 support, by phone or ticket, and along with hundreds of guides and tutorials,

155
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,440
they're going to help you get started.

156
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,200
I love all of the guides, because they inspire me to build things, too.

157
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,840
And often, it's just one click away, with several applications you can deploy with very

158
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,960
little effort, or build it up from the ground up and learn something.

159
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,480
And remember, without $100 credit, it's never been a better time to learn.

160
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Linode.com slash LAN.

161
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,120
Go there and find out why we think they're just the best.

162
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,800
Check out their S3 compatible object storage, which could up your backup game, or maybe

163
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,560
just be a great way to run a static website.

164
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,160
Super fast networking, and machines that are blazing fast.

165
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,800
Go see why we use them for everything.

166
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:33,160
Linode.com slash LAN.

167
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,380
And thank you to our long time supporters over at Ting.

168
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:42,720
Go to linux.ting.com and get $25 off a great plan or a great phone.

169
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,840
Ting just makes mobile so much simpler.

170
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:50,320
Stop banging your head against all of these confusing plans with these weird small print

171
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,520
items.

172
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,400
Just go to linux.ting.com.

173
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,640
Check out their Set 12 plan.

174
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,000
It gives you 12 gigs of data with unlimited talk and text for $35 a month.

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,800
And they have plans that are perfect for families, or plans that are great for individuals that

176
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,720
don't use data or need all the data.

177
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,340
Ting's got every plan covered with their award winning customer service, Nationwide

178
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,160
LTE and 5G coverage.

179
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,380
I'm impressed as a Ting customer how real the 5G promise has been after years of hype.

180
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:26,640
It's in my neighborhood, and it's mind blowing, 100 megabits on Ting 5G.

181
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,680
It's so great.

182
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,120
And I have the freedom of no contract.

183
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,200
No contract ever with Ting.

184
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,820
So go pick Ting right now and choose from one of their great networks.

185
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,760
It's simple to switch to Ting, pretty much any phone will work because they've got lots

186
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,120
of compatibility, and you can just get started by going to linux.ting.com.

187
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,640
Check your current phone, create the account, get the plan that's just right for you, and

188
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,480
then Ting will send you a SIM card.

189
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,440
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier with Ting's new plans.

190
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,000
The next generation of Ting mobile, it's here, and it's better than ever.

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:10,520
Go see how much you can save and then take $25 off at linux.ting.com.

192
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,760
Windows 11 is making a lot of news this week, but one of the issues that has caught the

193
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:22,720
attention of Linux users is Microsoft's requirement that computers running Windows 11 must have

194
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,200
a TPM chip and it must be enabled.

195
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:33,240
The TPM is a chip connected to your main motherboard, and what makes it special is a collection

196
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,080
of registers called platform configuration registers or PCRs.

197
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,600
When the system is reset, these registers are initialized and then during the boot process,

198
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,400
the system will generate cryptographic hashes of the various boot components and then pass

199
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,300
those hashes back to the old TPM.

200
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,440
Any modifications to the boot components thereafter will then change the value of all those hashes

201
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,440
and then change the values recorded in the TPM.

202
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,980
This is basically called measured boot because you're measuring all the different components

203
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:08,120
going on and then down the line that lets you detect changes or do things like restrict

204
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,040
access if you're not in the right measured state.

205
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,700
BitLocker, for example, leverages the TPM to ensure that volumes can only be decrypted

206
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,960
if the system booted as expected by all those measurements in the TPM.

207
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:25,940
Now why this is a concern to Linux users is many systems built to run Linux don't bother

208
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:30,680
putting TPM in because it's not something currently used by Linux and so these machines,

209
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,120
which might otherwise be great dual booters, will just simply be left out.

210
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,200
And not all Windows PCs have TPM necessarily turned on either and that can be tricky for

211
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,880
average users but the primary concern here is creating a generation of PCs that might

212
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,400
leave Linux out or I guess, Wes, it wouldn't be all Linux, it would just be any Linux that

213
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,920
hasn't been signed by Microsoft.

214
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:58,480
Yeah, because in conjunction with the TPM is our old friend Secure Boot and the goal

215
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,680
here is kind of partially to combine these two technologies together because Secure Boot

216
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,400
allows the firmware to validate your boot loader before executing it, right?

217
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,240
It's the bit that has your computer say, well, is this new OS you want to boot signed by

218
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,840
Microsoft or well, technically signed by whatever keys I am happened to be told to trust, otherwise

219
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,960
I won't boot it.

220
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,240
Now that works pretty well but if you're also worried about firmware attacks and Microsoft

221
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,040
says they are, well, the firmware itself could be backdoored and you would have no way to

222
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,900
really verify that Secure Boot function correctly and that's where some of these boot attacks

223
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:36,000
come from and that's where the TPM comes into play because it turns out you can use that

224
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,560
TPM to measure the Secure Boot state and detect if that changes and just further add boot

225
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
security.

226
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,640
Yeah, that's why they work well together and that's why some Linux vendors have been open

227
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,600
to implementing this and obviously making sure that your boot environment is secure

228
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,200
and verified is critical and that is a real world use case, especially one appealing to

229
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,200
enterprise.

230
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,840
However, all of that said, because I just want to play devil's advocate for those who

231
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,600
are concerned here, all of what I've just said aside, I think the reality is Microsoft

232
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,600
has been pushing this particular technology stack for over a decade and the fact that

233
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,400
it's taken this long for all of the pieces to be turned on because they had some requirements

234
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,280
in Windows 10 but it didn't have to be on by default, they've slowly been turning the

235
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:21,840
temperature up on this particular issue for about a decade now.

236
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,500
And that makes me think it's not a customer driven issue because if it was enterprise

237
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,200
customers knocking on Satya Nadella's door saying we need more security, Microsoft would

238
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,700
have flipped these bits on immediately, maybe even enterprise versions would have it on

239
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,140
by default.

240
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,920
This would have already been a solved problem.

241
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:42,560
The very fact that they've drugged this out for so long and have done this very slow incremental

242
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:49,440
approach actually makes me think this is a Microsoft driven feature for Microsoft motivations,

243
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,880
which I just can't help but think perhaps some might be to leave some systems in a state

244
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,680
where they're more like ARM systems, where they come with an x86 OS, perhaps that's been

245
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:03,940
subsidized by a vendor relationship and it's always going to run that particular x86 OS.

246
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,840
Maybe it's a Linux, maybe it's something like Chrome OS, more than likely it's something

247
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,220
like Windows 10.

248
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,940
And that has to be part of the motivation here.

249
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,160
So I do understand the Linux users who are concerned about this.

250
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,380
The flip side, I think Wes, and I wonder if you agree with this, is it feels like the

251
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,600
Linux vendor ecosystem is healthy enough at this point that even if some Windows vendors

252
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:29,440
make the decision either via laziness or intentionally to lock out other operating systems, it's

253
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,840
almost a non-issue to me because of these other vendors.

254
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,840
Yeah, you're right.

255
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,600
I mean, we've got a lot more options in the Linux space than we once did, including some

256
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,720
bigger vendors that themselves are happy to ship Linux.

257
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,160
So I don't see them shutting it out anytime soon.

258
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,760
But it is a little bit worrying that we're seeing more of a closed walled off garden

259
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,120
approach on the regular PC side of the fence as well.

260
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,440
I mean, as Apple's been arguing in court lately, yes, it is more secure if you restrict what

261
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,720
you can run on your computer, but I don't think that's a trade-off we've all agreed

262
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,800
to make on some of these more traditional platforms.

263
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,400
Yeah, I couldn't have said it better myself.

264
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:13,040
We have seen so much of mobile UI and mobile use paradigm infect the desktop.

265
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,160
And then we've kind of now, within the last couple of years, rounded the corner and found

266
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,580
the right balance there.

267
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,280
And I just don't want to see that same mobile creep happen when it comes to locking down

268
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,480
boot environments, locking down our machines.

269
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,480
That's been a mistake, I think, in the mobile universe, at least for some phones and some

270
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,680
types of devices.

271
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,760
And I just hate to see backward steps taken in the PC industry, making that aspect more

272
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
like mobile.

273
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,040
Now, I should note that even in the worst case here, where you can only boot Microsoft

274
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,320
software, for the moment, they are signing some distributions, bootloaders, right?

275
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,160
You'll be able to boot Ubuntu on one of these machines in theory, no problem, at least if

276
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,360
booting from USB is enabled in the firmware.

277
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,880
Yeah, and it seems like they've been a good faith player in that space for a while.

278
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,600
They have a good track record there.

279
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,840
So it's not alarm bells, but maybe slightly concerning to see a trend going in this direction.

280
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,560
And good luck getting your Arch install booting up on there.

281
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,560
And our last story is one that we've been watching develop for a long time.

282
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,480
TrueNAS Scale 2106 Beta is now available.

283
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,880
TrueNAS Scale is something kind of special.

284
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,400
It's like FreeNAS, but not based on BSD.

285
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,240
In fact, it's based on Debian Linux.

286
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,600
There's kind of a range of these products now, Wes.

287
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,760
Maybe we can help break them down.

288
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
All right.

289
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,000
Well, at the base, you've got TrueNAS, the free public base version, TrueNAS Core.

290
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,480
Now, this was previously known as FreeNAS, and that's probably what you know it as best.

291
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,800
Then there was sort of the traditional TrueNAS, which is like the commercial big brother of

292
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,960
traditional FreeNAS.

293
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,080
That's TrueNAS Enterprise.

294
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,000
Both of those are based on FreeBSD as usual.

295
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,960
And then as of January 2021, when we learned about this, there's TrueNAS Scale providing

296
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,240
open source hyper converged infrastructure, including Linux containers and virtual machines.

297
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,280
And yeah, that one is powered by Debian.

298
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,720
That caught my attention because I liked FreeNAS and by extension, TrueNAS quite a bit, but

299
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,880
honestly felt a little bit lost.

300
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,200
Many times something went a little sideways and I needed to actually go down to the command

301
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
line.

302
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,360
But now, with something based on Debian, using tools that I'm familiar with, it's kind of

303
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,000
marrying the best of both worlds.

304
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,040
So we gave it a go before the show, popped it on a machine and demoed it for a bit, and

305
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,720
I'm really impressed with the interface.

306
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,560
It's using their new slick UI that they've been developing for a little while, and it

307
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,640
makes it outrageously simple to set up a ZFS pool and then start installing applications

308
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,520
via Docker, which opens them up to a huge, huge, huge community of applications.

309
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,080
Yeah, I think the flexibility of this is pretty key.

310
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,000
I mean, they've had a lot of experience as a company making these UIs, managing your

311
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,040
basic simple NAS devices, but they really stress here that TrueNAS Scale is all about

312
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,040
the scale.

313
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,720
You can take just a single node and it's still super simple for you as a home user to get

314
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
set up.

315
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,440
But if your needs start growing, maybe you're a small business and you get some additional

316
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,920
locations, you can actually scale these systems out both individually on the compute side

317
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,200
and individually on the storage side.

318
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,880
And I think maybe part of what makes that quote-unquote scale happen is I think there's

319
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,080
some Kubernetes happening in the background because I noticed when I was deploying an

320
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,080
image, there was some Kubernetes commands executing on the console.

321
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,040
Yeah, I mean, it's got all the Linux hits, Docker, Kubernetes, and KVM.

322
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,880
Yeah, I was going to say.

323
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,120
And of course, a little bit of ZFS on the side with a nice UI and then their support

324
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,560
from IX Systems.

325
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,080
I think it's a pretty compelling product.

326
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:39,200
I think it's everything I ever wanted from TrueNAS and FreeNAS, but now it's based on

327
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,760
Linux and this is really worth taking a look.

328
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,760
Check out TrueNAS Scale.

329
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,760
We'll have a link in the show notes.

330
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,740
It's a pretty solid product and it's really, I could see the ideal small business server.

331
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,280
You put this on there.

332
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,700
We started talking about the Western Digital Livebook.

333
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,440
This is such a great example of an appliance you could build out of an x86 computer with

334
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,920
a couple of hard drives.

335
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,800
Our test rig had three hard drives and it just saw all the disk and made a nice pool

336
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,040
that we could use and start taking advantage of right away.

337
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,040
It probably took 15 minutes to set up.

338
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,000
Now, this is still beta, of course, but if you're interested in another contender in

339
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,560
the space, maybe give it a go and provide IX Systems some feedback.

340
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,700
Yeah, they would love that.

341
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,240
And we'll keep an eye on things and keep testing it as they finish it up.

342
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,360
In the meantime, go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new

343
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
episodes.

344
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:31,760
You can visit linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch, but please no TrueNAS

345
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,080
scale bug reports.

346
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,680
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

347
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:40,240
We have two meetups coming up in early August in Salt Lake City and in Denver.

348
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,440
And if you can go, we'd love to know.

349
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,400
So join us at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting and sign up for one of those two meetups.

350
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,800
And just to note, there'll be a slightly delayed episode next week, but you should still have

351
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,560
your weekly Linux news on Monday with our take on everything that happened in Linux

352
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,560
and open source.

353
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:25,640
Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next week.
