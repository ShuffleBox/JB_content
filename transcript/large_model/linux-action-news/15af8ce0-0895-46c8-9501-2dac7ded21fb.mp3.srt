00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,260
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,460
This is episode 67, recorded on August 19th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,460
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,460
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,460
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:29,200
It is really great to be connected to you while you are live down at OggCamp 2018.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,880
And we're kicking things off with a story that I bet you heard some buzz about at OggCamp

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,960
because people are talking about it all over the internet.

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,680
It's these rumors that Valve is working to make Windows games work on SteamOS.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,120
Yeah, unfortunately, all it is is rumors.

11
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,600
So we don't know whether it's them using wine or whether they've written something themselves,

12
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,440
or exactly how it's going to work.

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,920
But it seems like a pretty logical step for them to do this in order to boost SteamOS

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,000
as a platform.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,760
Like a few stories recently, this started by people digging on Reddit through Steam

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,760
TB.

17
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,760
And they found a string named string settings compat info, where the description reads,

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,480
quote, steam will automatically install compatibility tools that allow you to play games from your

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,760
library that were built for other operating systems, end quote.

20
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,600
Yeah, and by other operating systems, they mean Windows.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
Absolutely.

22
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,040
And there's a there's also another string in there they found the steam settings compat

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,640
advanced info, which has a warning in there, which reads, quote, you may select a compatibility

24
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,640
tool to use with games that have not been tested or verified to work on this platform.

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,320
This may not work as expected and can cause issues with your games, including crashes

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,760
and breaking saved games.

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,760
That last warning there about crashes and breaking save games has most of the internet

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,480
speculating this is some sort of wine compatibility layer.

29
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,560
I don't know, Joe.

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,720
I'm more inclined to think it's more like something like DX VK, which is that DirectX

31
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,880
to Vulkan compatibility layer that would only work with Windows Vulkan games.

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,200
Well, maybe it's both.

33
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,600
Maybe the Vulkan games are going to work better than the others, but they're going to at least

34
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:10,200
attempt to support the non Vulkan stuff just to widen the number of titles that they've

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,960
got available for Steam OS.

36
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,280
Well, something tells me we'll be learning more in the near future.

37
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,200
These things have a way of just keep coming and leaking and then they grow and then eventually

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,600
we see the complete story.

39
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,600
So we'll just keep tracking it.

40
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,040
Well, one project that we've been keeping an eye on is Endless OS and last time we were

41
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,240
talking about it, things weren't going too well for them, but now things seem to be looking

42
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:34,760
up because they are going to be shipping it on some Asus hardware.

43
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,600
This is an interesting partnership indeed.

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,600
You remember Endless, the GNOME focused Endless OS, which is based on Debian.

45
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:48,240
It is shipping already on the Asus VivoBook 15 X540NA.

46
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,660
That's one of the few products that you can get Endless on.

47
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,320
It also has an option for Windows 10, but it sounds like this may be expanding a bit.

48
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,160
I did some digging around too and there's already some support documents up on Asus's

49
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,240
website as well as an introduction to Endless on Asus's website.

50
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,080
So it seems really early days, but it could pan out to additional hardware.

51
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,920
This seems like a pretty great partnership for them.

52
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,920
Oh, definitely.

53
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,800
It's pretty modest hardware, isn't it?

54
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,000
Two gigabytes of RAM and we're not talking about i3s and i5s here.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,240
We're talking about the low cost, low end machines, but that's kind of what Endless

56
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,520
is aimed at anyway, isn't it?

57
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,680
So it sort of makes sense to start with that kind of hardware.

58
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
I could see that.

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,280
I would be curious to see how GNOME 3 shell performs on that.

60
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,220
And keep in mind too, Endless has been heavily tailored to have pretty good functionality

61
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,940
offline as well.

62
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,920
That's kind of neat in a laptop of this size you might have in your bag.

63
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,500
You want to break it out while you're on the commute and get some work done.

64
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,940
And to have a bunch of stuff like Wikipedia and whatnot available offline might be a really

65
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,800
nice combination with lightweight, cheap hardware.

66
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,380
But we have been burned by Asus before, haven't we?

67
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:57,880
Remember Xandros with the netbooks and they kind of made this whole market.

68
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,040
And then when that didn't pan out, they just got rid of Linux completely and started saying

69
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,220
it's better with Windows and stuff.

70
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,600
They're saying that still right now on their website.

71
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,840
And it's very heavily marketed as a Windows 10 home machine.

72
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,340
They do seem to fail to go all in, like they don't quite grok that they need to completely

73
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,340
go all in.

74
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,800
Even if it's just one product, go all in like Dell did with the XPS 13.

75
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,760
Instead they sort of have this back burner hidden down on their website that they don't

76
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,760
really talk about, but you can go get support from Endless solution.

77
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,600
Maybe that grows into something bigger, but when you sort of tend to repeat the mistakes

78
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,640
of the past, you tend to get the same results.

79
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,400
Well, to be fair, with the XPS 13, they do also do them with Windows.

80
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,800
It's not going quite all in, is it, with the Linux, but at least they are making a proper

81
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,520
effort and you get people like Barton coming along and really promoting it and engaging

82
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,520
with the community.

83
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,760
Whereas, yeah, not so much with Asus, unfortunately.

84
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,760
Yeah.

85
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,820
I mean, really to clarify the going all in statement, I just mean a website that I can

86
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,220
go to where this product has been end to end tested running Linux and I can see a whole

87
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,060
website about the information.

88
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,240
Like it's a real product from the company, not something hidden away.

89
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,620
That's all they really have to do is keep selling the Windows 10 version, keep making

90
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,600
a website that talks about all the great features of Windows 10.

91
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,960
Also make a website that highlights and features the Ubuntu version or whatever it might be

92
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,120
and do the same thing.

93
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,160
That's all I'm saying is go all in in a way that's a full product.

94
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,160
Yeah.

95
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
Well, it is early days.

96
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,160
They're just testing the water.

97
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,480
If they sell well, then maybe they will do that and all we can do is hope really.

98
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
I think so.

99
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,720
And wouldn't it be really interesting to see if those could get some traction and education,

100
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,560
the price point combined with Endless, that could be a really nice document editing machine

101
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,880
in high schools or or even middle school.

102
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,760
So there could be some real potential in education.

103
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,080
Well, another potential option for that kind of low end hardware would be the Trinity desktop.

104
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,480
TDE, a continuation originally of KDE 3.

105
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,960
Now it's really it's its own project and they just had a big update.

106
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,880
They just shipped version R1 14.05.

107
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,960
It's their fifth maintenance release of the series and they've made some nice maintenance

108
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,960
improvements, fixed things like Ogg playback and some sound server issues and did some

109
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:12,260
major code base refactoring, they say, and fixed a few memory leaks as well and added

110
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,680
a few features.

111
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,160
But that's not really the headline feature here.

112
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:22,320
The headline feature is that a desktop environment that harkens back to KDE 3, the 90s is still

113
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,000
getting updates and seeing releases.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,360
I love open source.

115
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,840
Well, yeah.

116
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,720
The real headline for me is that I thought that they were pretty much dead because we

117
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,120
haven't had a release for nearly two years.

118
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,200
And here we are with a new release.

119
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:44,440
So just open source refuses to die, especially people's favorite desktop environments.

120
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,000
I am seriously tempted to give it a go.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,280
I did make an attempt before the show, but their live CDs haven't been updated yet.

122
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,960
So I might kick the tires in a few days once they've updated their live CDs.

123
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,160
I just I got to try it out for nostalgia purposes.

124
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,080
Well, I haven't had much time because I've been at odd camp, obviously, as we mentioned,

125
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,200
hence my echoing audio, sorry about that.

126
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,160
But I did have a quick chance to spin up slacks in a VM last night.

127
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,960
And after I did app get dist upgrade on it, because it is Debian based, it did show as

128
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,360
being 14.0.5.

129
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,100
But it said that it was from April of this year.

130
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,960
So it's all a bit confusing, really.

131
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,680
But I don't think it's changed massively in terms of features and stuff.

132
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,880
It's quite a lot of bug fixes.

133
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,200
And there are a few features, but the overall aesthetic of it hasn't changed.

134
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,800
And it did give me kind of fond memories of my early Linux days, funny enough with slacks

135
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,920
being this really light distro.

136
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,680
And I don't know as much as I do really appreciate what the KDE team has done with plasma five

137
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,920
looking back at KDE three, okay, it looks a little bit dated, okay, it looks a lot dated,

138
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,640
but functionally, it is a great desktop.

139
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:02,080
Yeah, you hate to give Microsoft credit, but that start menu, launcher bar, quick icons

140
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,000
setup that they kind of refined after Windows 95 over the years, and then lost the trail

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
after Windows Vista, it is a functional launcher.

142
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,960
And if you add that, and you put a decent file manager on there, and you have good performance

143
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,840
in a terminal, you're pretty close to having most people's bases covered.

144
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,560
Yeah, and if you look at KDE four, I think they just added too much bloat to that.

145
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,160
And it took people a long time to get used to it.

146
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,800
And I never got used to it.

147
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,400
And it was only really when five came out that I reevaluated that situation as an it's

148
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,360
almost like four is that Vista type release, probably kill me for saying that.

149
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,920
But three was great, but a bit dated for not so much.

150
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,080
But now with five, that just keeps getting better and better.

151
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,920
And I don't know, it's good to see Trinity.

152
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,960
It's a little bit like Marte, isn't it?

153
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,920
In a sense, Marte is more modern, of course.

154
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,820
But it just goes to show that if you make major changes, some people just will not like

155
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,820
those changes.

156
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,160
And they'll just hang around with the old version and fork it and still maintain it.

157
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,600
It gives me a lot of hope, actually, for XFCE that maybe I can just keep using that forever.

158
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
It will never die.

159
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:19,560
I mean, imagine, could you imagine if KDE 3 is still getting some love today, then XFCE

160
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,760
is probably good for the rest of your life.

161
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,360
Well, with the amount I drink, that won't be too long.

162
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,460
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

163
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,260
It's a platform to learn more about Linux and all the things that runs Linux, advanced

164
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,460
training tools that increase your skills and encourage critical thinking, full featured

165
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,960
training library with servers that you spin up on demand, interactive guides as you dig

166
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,220
in, real human being instructors ready to help you, topic experts on the subject, practice

167
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,040
exams and quizzes.

168
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,520
There's so much to the platform that I encourage you to take advantage of that seven day free

169
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
trial.

170
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
And don't worry if you're busy.

171
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,960
They have a course scheduler where you can pick a course in a time frame and it'll help

172
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
you stick to it.

173
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,560
They have a vibrant community that keeps you going.

174
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,680
They have a flashcard system that gets forked by that community.

175
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,200
So there's a lot happening there.

176
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,480
And if you're just trying out Linux Academy, you're not sure yet, check out their YouTube

177
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,800
channel Linux Academy com on YouTube.

178
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,260
They're posting stuff every week now, like several things.

179
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,840
Their CEO, Anthony, just posted a new video as well as another edition of Google Cloud

180
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,040
Weekly just went up and they're doing some Docker beginner training sessions over on

181
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,680
their channel to all for free.

182
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,420
They're just passionate about this kind of stuff.

183
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,480
So try them out.

184
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,900
Go try out the course scheduler, maybe the learning pass.

185
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,880
See a series of course and content that's been planned by an instructor for your specific

186
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,000
career track.

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,840
Try out one of those hands on labs.

188
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:43,520
It's all available at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

189
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:51,120
So let's talk about Richard Hughes again and the LVFS project, Linux Vendor Firmware Service.

190
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,680
We've talked about Lenovo joining the project and how great that is, especially for you

191
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,840
wanting to buy a ThinkPad soon.

192
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:03,840
But now Richard wants to broaden the scope a little bit and his next target is NVME drives,

193
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,520
SSDs.

194
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,560
And he wants people to submit some data about what SSDs are out there so that he knows what

195
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
to work on.

196
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,600
And he's got a post on the GNOME blog with instructions of how to do that.

197
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,760
So if you do have an NVME drive in your machine, then do check out linuxactionnews.com slash

198
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,760
67 and there'll be a link there.

199
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,640
You can click through to his blog, run a couple of commands, send him off the data and help

200
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,880
with getting some firmware updates for SSDs.

201
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,880
I ran the command.

202
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,000
It's pretty straightforward on Ubuntu and Fedora systems.

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,920
The package you need to install is NVME dash CLI.

204
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,080
And then once you install NVME dash CLI, you run the commands that Richard outlines and

205
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,680
you basically get back like the manufacturer identification and a model number, at least

206
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,880
on my Samsung drives, and I'll send those off to him.

207
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,880
That's pretty nice.

208
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,560
And he has all the information you'd need on the blog post there.

209
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,720
Yeah, and I think this kind of opt in approach is not going to offend anyone, is it?

210
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,280
Because if you don't want to share your data, you just don't run the commands.

211
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,720
This isn't something baked into any distro or desktop environment, but that does mean

212
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,920
he's going to get less data as a result of possibly doing something like putting it into

213
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,240
GNOME software or whatever.

214
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,620
Yeah, hopefully if he just gets an idea, you know, a snapshot of what the more popular

215
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,720
drives out there, it'll at least tell him where to start working.

216
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,100
The Linux kernel developers have been up to some hard work.

217
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,240
We've got not one, but two kernel updates in the last week.

218
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,720
Yeah, 4.18 and then a few point releases.

219
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,140
We've got the 4.18.3, which is already out within a week.

220
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,240
But this 4.18 kernel is a big one, isn't it?

221
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,880
There's a lot of new features in there.

222
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,640
Yeah, not only do you get support for the AMD Radeon RX Vega M chips, complete support

223
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,880
for the Raspberry Pi 3B and 3B+.

224
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,880
We're also getting support for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 ARM chip, which is what's found

225
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,920
in those new Windows 10 ARM systems.

226
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,220
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

227
00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,600
There's all kinds of great things in 4.18, even some improvements to USB Type-C and Thunderbolt.

228
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,120
But what do you make of this inclusion of the spec file system encryption support?

229
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,540
Yeah, the spec cipher, which has gotten some buzz around it online because the NSA was

230
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,840
involved with its creation.

231
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,420
This is something that I have to dig more into.

232
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,620
You know, I do understand why people have a strong reaction, but I think it might be

233
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,880
a future deep dive topic.

234
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,640
Yeah, there's a lot of speculation, isn't there, that the NSA have got the means to

235
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,880
crack this cipher, and that's why they're so keen to push it out into the mainstream.

236
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,960
I suppose we don't have to use it, do we, just because it's in the kernel, but I think

237
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,440
it's upset quite a lot of people.

238
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,400
Yeah, I think that's why it's worthy of the deep dive.

239
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,320
Yeah, well, we'll have to get Wes on the case for a TechSnap episode.

240
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,760
Well, speaking of TechSnap, we did a complete breakdown of Foreshadow, or that L1 data cache

241
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,120
bug, whichever one you like to call it, the terminal fault.

242
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,360
That also got patched this week.

243
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,320
Now, just a quick high level, it was discovered that memory present in the L1 cache of an

244
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:59,680
Intel CPU core may be exposed to malicious processes that are executing on the CPU core.

245
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,760
This vulnerability is known as L1 terminal fault, or L1 TF.

246
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,000
A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive information from other

247
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,080
guest hosts.

248
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,620
So it was a big deal for the cloud providers.

249
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,760
There's a new kernel update as well that mitigates this.

250
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,360
Yet more speculative execution vulnerabilities.

251
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,040
I remember when Spectre and Meltdown, the news of that broke, and we said at the time,

252
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,540
this is just the tip of the iceberg here.

253
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,480
We know there's going to be a lot more of this.

254
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,440
And sure enough, here we are.

255
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,080
I think this is the third or fourth one that has a name.

256
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,380
Yeah, if you're on a supported distribution, it is worth upgrading because one of the things

257
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,920
we've also discovered is sometimes the initial headline comes out and then people work away

258
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,320
at it for a few weeks and they discover other clever ways to exploit those flaws to go after

259
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,440
desktop users.

260
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,760
So it starts really impacting cloud providers because you have this ability for the guest

261
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,760
VM to read data from other guest VMs.

262
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,160
That's bad.

263
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,840
But given time, researchers and others tend to find ways to go after desktop users.

264
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:03,200
So if you're on a distribution that's getting an update, the Ubuntu, the Debian, the CentOS,

265
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,100
the Red Hats, go apply your update.

266
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,420
And one of the emails that you definitely don't want to wake up to when you are away

267
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:16,080
at a conference like OggCamp is an unattended upgrades reboot required email because, okay,

268
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,920
it's normally fine when you reboot.

269
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,280
It almost always is, but there's always that feeling in your stomach like, please come

270
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
back up.

271
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
Please.

272
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,680
And so I did it and thankfully I was able to go to OggCamp and not spend all day trying

273
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,680
to fix it.

274
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,680
Well, good on you.

275
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,680
You stayed current, Joe.

276
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,760
I'm proud of you.

277
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,520
Some people might say, oh, that Joe, he never installs his updates, but that right there

278
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,720
proves otherwise.

279
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,600
