Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.460 --> 00:20.520
This is episode 98, recorded on March 24th, 2019.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.520
I'm Chris.

00:21.520 --> 00:22.520
And I'm Joe.

00:22.520 --> 00:23.520
Hello, Joe.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.380
Good to be connected with you.

00:25.380 --> 00:29.280
It's a bit of a gaming week, lots of big announcements, and we pulled out a few of

00:29.280 --> 00:30.860
the Linux related ones for you.

00:30.860 --> 00:35.000
Let's start with the big service that's been announced that runs on Linux.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.960
Yes, Stadia from Google, which is their cloud gaming service, which was announced to a lot

00:39.960 --> 00:44.600
of fanfare and a lot of publicity, but we're pretty scant on details apart from the fact

00:44.600 --> 00:51.400
that it's running Linux on the back end and it's heavily tied into YouTube and you don't

00:51.400 --> 00:57.400
really need a powerful client machine at all because it's all happening on the server end.

00:57.400 --> 01:02.880
In the announcement, Google even talked about using a Chromecast as a possible end device

01:02.880 --> 01:09.440
paired with their custom controller that also connects directly to the cloud and will have

01:09.440 --> 01:12.000
a Google assistant microphone.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.720
Now they didn't show this on stage, but they claimed that you could be playing a game and

01:16.720 --> 01:19.280
you could ask the Google assistant for help.

01:19.280 --> 01:23.920
Yeah, and then supposedly YouTube video pops up with how to do that little bit of the level

01:23.920 --> 01:25.400
or whatever.

01:25.400 --> 01:31.360
But that microphone, yeah, I don't think I'll be buying one of these controllers somehow.

01:31.360 --> 01:35.040
I love that they've managed to work a microphone into everything, although it's getting more

01:35.040 --> 01:36.040
and more common.

01:36.040 --> 01:39.640
My Nvidia Shield has a microphone in it as well because everybody wants to search by

01:39.640 --> 01:40.720
voice, I guess.

01:40.720 --> 01:44.560
I've never really gotten that because the living room is often a very loud environment.

01:44.560 --> 01:49.440
One other interesting kind of thing that they've tied in with this is even for systems that

01:49.440 --> 01:54.560
don't support the full 4K 60 frames per second they're claiming, maybe you're on a device

01:54.560 --> 02:00.200
connected to a 1080p display, when you do a capture, which this controller will have

02:00.200 --> 02:04.920
a dedicated capture button, when you do this capture it's captured on the remote side in

02:04.920 --> 02:10.140
full 4K 60 frames a second resolution and then can post that theoretically to YouTube

02:10.140 --> 02:14.080
in full resolution even if the version you're playing is just a 1080p version.

02:14.080 --> 02:17.160
Yeah, it's all very promising technically.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.080
I'm very skeptical about this.

02:19.080 --> 02:25.680
I suppose we'll get on to why it's good for Linux ultimately, but I don't think this is

02:25.680 --> 02:27.680
going to be very long-lived somehow.

02:27.680 --> 02:31.320
There's been a lot of attempts at this cloud gaming thing and, okay, Google have got the

02:31.320 --> 02:38.880
resources to burn like most companies don't, but ultimately it's not going to be very good,

02:38.880 --> 02:39.880
is it?

02:39.880 --> 02:42.480
I mean, yeah, okay, they're making all these promises about low latency and everything,

02:42.480 --> 02:47.040
but you need at least 25 megabits per second down, which, okay, it's not a problem for

02:47.040 --> 02:52.920
me, it's not a problem for you, but for most people in America, they just don't have 25

02:52.920 --> 02:53.920
down.

02:53.920 --> 02:58.840
And if they do, it's pretty sketchy and with all this net neutrality stuff means that it's

02:58.840 --> 03:04.680
likely that it'll end up getting throttled and I just don't see it taking off long term

03:04.680 --> 03:05.680
somehow.

03:05.680 --> 03:09.120
Yeah, not to mention if you're on mobile, the latency of a mobile network will probably

03:09.120 --> 03:10.780
render this unplayable.

03:10.780 --> 03:12.320
There are definitely issues.

03:12.320 --> 03:17.860
However, Google has quite the infrastructure and in the announcement, they dropped a number

03:17.860 --> 03:24.180
like 7,500 edge nodes that are close to players to provide the ultimate gaming performance.

03:24.180 --> 03:27.960
So they've thought about this problem from a technical standpoint.

03:27.960 --> 03:32.520
And I kind of have this sense that it's a bit like the early days of YouTube.

03:32.520 --> 03:36.200
Early days of YouTube, nobody had the bandwidth to watch a YouTube video without it buffering.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.540
It played like hell.

03:37.540 --> 03:41.240
It was so bad that Google set up this page where it would try to help you diagnose where

03:41.240 --> 03:43.320
your buffering issues were coming from.

03:43.320 --> 03:48.060
And these days, I never have a problem with YouTube, even on the worst kind of connections.

03:48.060 --> 03:53.120
These things get solved over time and this could be Google's attempt to build a YouTube

03:53.120 --> 03:54.200
for gaming.

03:54.200 --> 03:59.160
And I think it's no coincidence that they're tying it in very closely with YouTube in a

03:59.160 --> 04:01.080
pretty brilliant way.

04:01.080 --> 04:05.360
You're sitting there watching a game trailer for say, Assassin's Creed or whatever it might

04:05.360 --> 04:08.420
be and they've got a play now button.

04:08.420 --> 04:12.520
And if you're already subscribed, maybe you're part of this premium package that includes

04:12.520 --> 04:17.980
YouTube and Google Play Music and this gaming service, you click that one button and they

04:17.980 --> 04:23.300
claim in some instances, in five seconds, the game's up and running.

04:23.300 --> 04:29.000
The other thing that's kind of crazy is you'll be able to share in-state links that load

04:29.000 --> 04:33.540
the game right at a specific place, like you can with a ROM where you pause the emulator

04:33.540 --> 04:36.000
and then you can resume right at that save state.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.280
You'll be able to send save state links if the game is written for the platform.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.680
Yeah, again, that's pretty impressive.

04:42.680 --> 04:47.740
And I remember when you guys talked about Google Cloud on TechSnap, the big standout

04:47.740 --> 04:51.920
feature of it is that the various data centers that they have communicate directly with each

04:51.920 --> 04:53.440
other, not over the public internet.

04:53.440 --> 05:00.280
And so that means that in theory, you're going to get way better performance than these competitors

05:00.280 --> 05:02.640
who've tried and failed at this.

05:02.640 --> 05:06.000
So I think if anyone can do it, Google can, but I just don't think that anyone can do

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
it somehow.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.200
But I think that they'll probably give it a go for a couple of years.

05:10.200 --> 05:14.840
And in that couple of years, it's going to be great for Linux gaming because this thing's

05:14.840 --> 05:15.880
running on Linux, right?

05:15.880 --> 05:22.400
So they're going to push forward the whole Linux gaming situation and development and

05:22.400 --> 05:26.480
everyone is potentially going to benefit from the work that they do there.

05:26.480 --> 05:29.020
This is an area where we need a lot more details.

05:29.020 --> 05:32.160
Up on stage, big graphic, Linux, Vulkan.

05:32.160 --> 05:37.160
If you want to write your game to our platform, target it for Linux and use Vulkan.

05:37.160 --> 05:41.480
Wow, my mind was blown when I saw that because think about the possibilities there, right?

05:41.480 --> 05:46.160
Because then it really is just a few more steps to publish it online, put it in Steam,

05:46.160 --> 05:47.920
whatever it might be.

05:47.920 --> 05:53.320
And there are advantages to specifically writing to Google's platform that could never be delivered

05:53.320 --> 05:56.280
in a console or in a desktop PC.

05:56.280 --> 06:01.760
And they don't go into a lot of details, but they say there is the ability to access more

06:01.760 --> 06:09.360
GPUs, perhaps lots of GPUs and specific systems that are designed to render physics and the

06:09.360 --> 06:14.600
ability to place thousands of cameras in various different places inside the game.

06:14.600 --> 06:20.820
You can also reskin game objects in real time with machine generated images if you write

06:20.820 --> 06:22.000
for their platform.

06:22.000 --> 06:26.640
So there are a lot of advantages to targeting Stadia if the platform does get some traction.

06:26.640 --> 06:30.460
I'm not as convinced they're going to kill this one quickly.

06:30.460 --> 06:35.240
They have been building to this with a beta now for a little while laying the foundation

06:35.240 --> 06:38.620
of a data center network of these devices.

06:38.620 --> 06:41.480
They've hired on a big shot VP to run it.

06:41.480 --> 06:46.120
I feel like this is something they've been investing in in the background for years now.

06:46.120 --> 06:49.480
So if they kill this thing, it's going to be quite a while before they do because of

06:49.480 --> 06:50.760
just the massive investment.

06:50.760 --> 06:55.680
Well, should we talk about this on Google Plus with each other or Allo or Buzz or Wave?

06:55.680 --> 06:56.680
I actually have...

06:56.680 --> 06:58.680
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

06:58.680 --> 07:06.560
Have a great Wave doc going with real time editing, you'll love it.

07:06.560 --> 07:12.280
Just look at killedbygoogle.com for the list, the long, long list of services that they've

07:12.280 --> 07:14.640
killed and hardware and stuff like that.

07:14.640 --> 07:21.920
I just find it very difficult to invest in a service that comes from Google unless it's

07:21.920 --> 07:26.600
one of their real core platforms like Gmail and search.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.920
And there's also the privacy implications here.

07:28.920 --> 07:35.480
There is a lot of baggage tied up when you sign up for another Google service.

07:35.480 --> 07:42.420
When you commit yourself further to the Google ecosystem, there is a price to pay in a sense.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.920
It's not a monetary price, but there is a price.

07:45.920 --> 07:49.640
And that, unfortunately, is not so easily solvable.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.760
It's something that everybody has to make their own decision on.

07:51.760 --> 07:57.000
Well, something that we've been talking about kind of off air is this idea of what it takes

07:57.000 --> 07:59.840
for certain areas of Linux to be pushed forward.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.240
And it's basically always money.

08:02.240 --> 08:08.360
And that's why development tools are amazing on Linux, because they make people money.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.840
And maybe this could be what makes gaming get pushed forward, because there's money

08:11.840 --> 08:14.520
to be made suddenly gaming on Linux.

08:14.520 --> 08:17.680
Yeah, we've just turned gaming into a server side application.

08:17.680 --> 08:19.680
Yeah, exactly.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.960
Which is really Linux's sweet spot.

08:21.960 --> 08:29.840
And in a way, it could mean that you're playing a Linux game on a Linux box, but it's streamed

08:29.840 --> 08:31.360
to that Linux box.

08:31.360 --> 08:36.240
So it sort of opens up a lot more games to Linux users.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.960
And it's using Linux to render that game.

08:38.960 --> 08:43.200
But it's coming back to you in a proprietary video stream that's probably wrapped up in

08:43.200 --> 08:44.200
DRM.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.100
So there's pluses and minuses.

08:46.100 --> 08:50.360
It means you can game without crazy graphics and you could use free open source drivers

08:50.360 --> 08:52.160
for your entire machine.

08:52.160 --> 08:57.280
It also means you're probably getting an H.264 DRM video stream or something like it.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.280
Yeah, maybe.

08:58.280 --> 09:02.520
But I'm just really hoping that all this Vulkan backend stuff that they're going to be working

09:02.520 --> 09:07.280
on to make this even better will filter down to the rest of us.

09:07.280 --> 09:12.740
And those of us who want to play games locally and not connect to the cloud will benefit

09:12.740 --> 09:13.740
from it.

09:13.740 --> 09:16.440
It is just too early to say, but I'm crossing my fingers on it.

09:16.440 --> 09:17.680
I'm going to remain optimistic.

09:17.680 --> 09:23.440
Well, if Google running Linux games on servers doesn't save Linux gaming, then maybe Open

09:23.440 --> 09:29.520
XR will, or at least virtual reality that's using Linux initially.

09:29.520 --> 09:30.520
It's kind of complicated.

09:30.520 --> 09:34.200
Well, as with any new standard, we all benefit when it's open.

09:34.200 --> 09:41.120
And this week, we learned about Open XR, which is a new standard from Khronos, which is totally

09:41.120 --> 09:50.080
open and pulls together, potentially at least, all AR and VR headsets and gives developers

09:50.080 --> 09:53.880
one thing to target rather than all these fragmented platforms.

09:53.880 --> 09:54.880
Right.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.520
It kind of reminds me a little bit of the early days of getting 3D games working on

09:58.520 --> 10:02.800
computers where you had all these different video cards and standards, and then the industry

10:02.800 --> 10:06.160
kind of coalesced around a couple of standards.

10:06.160 --> 10:07.900
This is going to be one of those.

10:07.900 --> 10:11.480
Like Joe said, it's from the Khronos group, which is the folks behind Vulkan, and that's

10:11.480 --> 10:13.080
been pretty successful.

10:13.080 --> 10:17.440
And there's already an open source Linux tie-in to this.

10:17.440 --> 10:21.860
So as a developer, you need a way to try out this Open XR runtime and make sure that you're

10:21.860 --> 10:26.940
communicating with the devices, because part of what Open XR does is it abstracts the controllers.

10:26.940 --> 10:31.720
So instead of saying right controller click, you can say grab item, things like that.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.720
But you need a way to program for that.

10:33.720 --> 10:41.200
So the folks at Collabra have developed Monado, which is a fully open source Open XR runtime

10:41.200 --> 10:42.200
on Linux.

10:42.200 --> 10:46.920
So yeah, that's the Linux tie-in here is gaming developers will be building Linux boxes running

10:46.920 --> 10:53.000
this runtime to develop for this new standard, which is supposedly going to unify all the

10:53.000 --> 10:54.600
VR headsets.

10:54.600 --> 10:58.900
And some big names are in on it, to be fair, Microsoft being one of the bigger ones and

10:58.900 --> 11:02.240
actually is actively promoting it on their Twitter.

11:02.240 --> 11:07.500
But HTC, a lot of the mobile vendors that are trying to make phone VR in Valve, Unity's

11:07.500 --> 11:08.500
in there.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.040
So it's got some industry support.

11:10.040 --> 11:13.400
It could actually take off, plus you figure with the Khronos folks behind it, it's got

11:13.400 --> 11:15.240
a good shot.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.760
Maybe finally, VR will be the big hit, Joe.

11:17.760 --> 11:21.080
Well, surprise, surprise, I'm going to be a little bit skeptical about whether it will

11:21.080 --> 11:22.080
take off.

11:22.080 --> 11:26.740
But I think if it has any chance of taking off, this is how it will happen.

11:26.740 --> 11:32.320
You need to have the open standard to attract the developers and therefore get the users.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.760
And although only a couple of headsets are supported right now, the idea and the hope

11:35.760 --> 11:43.120
is that new ones that come out will be supported by this and even existing ones will eventually

11:43.120 --> 11:44.120
be supported.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.560
So as I said, if there's any chance of it happening, this is it.

11:47.560 --> 11:49.080
But I'm still somewhat skeptical.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.080
I'm half skeptical.

11:50.080 --> 11:57.560
You see, I don't think it's necessarily going to mean much for the end users, at least Linux

11:57.560 --> 11:58.560
end users.

11:58.560 --> 12:03.640
But I do think there's a really interesting similarity between the Google announcements

12:03.640 --> 12:05.640
and this Khronos Group announcement.

12:05.640 --> 12:12.480
And the intrinsic message in both of those announcements to the developers is go use

12:12.480 --> 12:14.120
Linux.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.800
If you want to build for our platform, go use Linux.

12:16.800 --> 12:21.980
If you want to start building now for this new open standard for VR, go use Linux.

12:21.980 --> 12:27.860
And I think it underscores why we need to have on the Linux side the best desktop for

12:27.860 --> 12:30.680
developers out there, out of any operating system.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.560
Better than Mac OS, better than Windows, and I think we're pretty much there.

12:33.560 --> 12:36.320
But there's some rough edges, and there's probably going to be more and more different

12:36.320 --> 12:41.560
use cases as more huge companies and groups say, go use Linux.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.000
So it's going to be a process.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.920
But that particular theme between these two announcements, I'm kind of excited about.

12:47.920 --> 12:51.280
Because developers are a great crowd, and the more of them that come over to Linux,

12:51.280 --> 12:53.960
I think the stronger, the better our desktop will be.

12:53.960 --> 12:57.240
And I think they're also a good group to help us work out some of those rough edges that

12:57.240 --> 12:58.240
might still exist.

12:58.240 --> 13:03.080
So you're saying that we need to have a great Linux desktop, a great experience for developers.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.160
Well, I can do you one better than that.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.560
I can do you 10 better than that.

13:06.560 --> 13:07.620
We've got 10 of them.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.620
You can have Plasma.

13:08.620 --> 13:09.620
You can have GNOME.

13:09.620 --> 13:10.620
XFCE for you.

13:10.620 --> 13:13.160
XFCE for all the developers.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.160
Yeah, talk about fragmentation.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.160
But I don't know.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.760
It's all choice and stuff.

13:16.760 --> 13:20.200
But I think realistically, GNOME is like the main one, isn't it?

13:20.200 --> 13:23.040
If you look at the main distros.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.680
And that is improving.

13:24.680 --> 13:29.280
As we talked about recently, the latest release of that is just massively improved.

13:29.280 --> 13:33.320
And the latest release of Ubuntu that we're getting in a few weeks is going to have tons

13:33.320 --> 13:34.900
of performance improvements.

13:34.900 --> 13:39.720
So hopefully, as these devs get attracted over to the platform, they will have a first

13:39.720 --> 13:42.500
class experience and will grow the community.

13:42.500 --> 13:45.360
There's another story this week that I thought was a bit interesting.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.140
And it's out of Intel.

13:47.140 --> 13:54.540
They're working on a driver for a graphics card that we likely would never run, but massive

13:54.540 --> 13:59.400
like super 500 top 100 computers will run.

13:59.400 --> 14:03.940
And I think it's interesting watching how they are working upstream to integrate this

14:03.940 --> 14:06.160
driver into the Linux source code.

14:06.160 --> 14:09.060
Yeah, this is the new Intel XE graphics.

14:09.060 --> 14:12.760
I think that's how you say it, which don't actually exist yet.

14:12.760 --> 14:17.280
We've kind of been hearing about this for a long time, their discrete graphics cards.

14:17.280 --> 14:23.960
And it looks as if there's going to be a distinction between the kind of GPUs that go in these

14:23.960 --> 14:29.000
supercomputers versus the PCIe cards that we're going to get.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.760
But it is interesting to see that they are very much concentrating on Linux.

14:33.760 --> 14:37.480
I mean, I suppose they'd have to really, and Intel have got a reasonably good track record

14:37.480 --> 14:42.120
when it comes to drivers, although not necessarily with updating them, but they seem to be getting

14:42.120 --> 14:43.680
better with that.

14:43.680 --> 14:49.520
But it looks as if we're going to get a serious third player in the GPU market, which has

14:49.520 --> 14:50.520
got to be good for everyone.

14:50.520 --> 14:56.480
Yeah, I mean, these rumors suggest the XE graphics will have discrete memory for the

14:56.480 --> 14:57.480
GPUs.

14:57.480 --> 15:00.760
So no longer integrated memory, which would be a big performance boost.

15:00.760 --> 15:05.480
And if Intel is building these to go after the supercomputer market, they're really building

15:05.480 --> 15:09.520
these to compete with Nvidia, because Nvidia is competing very strongly there right now.

15:09.520 --> 15:12.200
And that's one of the reasons they've been dedicated to the Linux driver.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.200
And this could be good for everybody.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.600
A little bit of competition might make everybody's drivers a little bit better.

15:16.600 --> 15:22.720
Well, I'm really hoping that Intel decides to stand out against Nvidia with these XE

15:22.720 --> 15:27.960
GPUs by actually having totally free software drivers that work really, really well, and

15:27.960 --> 15:29.960
we don't need to have blobs.

15:29.960 --> 15:34.920
I'm fairly hopeful for that, because it would be a real competitive advantage and would

15:34.920 --> 15:39.160
encourage people to buy these cards, which are obviously new to the market.

15:39.160 --> 15:42.900
So fingers crossed that this is excellent news for Linux.

15:42.900 --> 15:47.000
The KDE Connect project got some bad news from Google this week, and then later on got

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
some good news.

15:48.000 --> 15:52.760
It started out with the project being removed from the Google Play Store for violating their

15:52.760 --> 15:57.820
new policy on apps that access your SMS messages.

15:57.820 --> 15:58.820
That was pretty upsetting.

15:58.820 --> 16:00.840
Of course, everybody said, hey, F-Droid's a thing.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.160
It's still an F-Droid, everybody.

16:02.160 --> 16:05.000
And so F-Droid, I think, picked up a few new users from the bad news.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.960
Yeah, that was the silver lining of this.

16:07.960 --> 16:13.220
But the reality is that almost everybody uses the Play Store to install apps, because if

16:13.220 --> 16:17.460
you want to use F-Droid, you have to go and allow untrusted sources and unknown sources,

16:17.460 --> 16:20.400
and that's quite scary for a lot of users.

16:20.400 --> 16:24.280
So it's good that it only took a couple of days and it's back in the Play Store.

16:24.280 --> 16:31.120
It did briefly reappear with the SMS functionality taken out of it, which is a big part of KDE

16:31.120 --> 16:32.120
Connect.

16:32.120 --> 16:37.200
So it was good to see that they sorted things out, and now it's back up in the Play Store

16:37.200 --> 16:38.200
fully functional.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.320
I completely agree.

16:39.320 --> 16:45.960
And for some context, Google did warn developers back on October 8, 2018, that as part of their

16:45.960 --> 16:51.520
developer policy updates that were impending, they would be limiting what apps were allowed

16:51.520 --> 16:52.960
to access your SMS.

16:52.960 --> 16:57.780
Essentially, if it wasn't your default SMS application, it had to have a damn good reason,

16:57.780 --> 17:01.440
and they had to get permission from Google to get access to your SMS to make it more

17:01.440 --> 17:07.120
in line with how iOS works, after certain companies like Facebook were found just whole

17:07.120 --> 17:10.480
hog reading your SMS messages and sending them back up to servers.

17:10.480 --> 17:15.640
Yeah, ultimately, Google are trying to do the right thing here, because security has

17:15.640 --> 17:21.160
been a bit lax on Android, specifically compared with iOS.

17:21.160 --> 17:24.680
So you can understand why they're trying to do this, but it just seems like they've been

17:24.680 --> 17:29.800
a bit heavy-handed with it, and it's not worked out exactly how they wanted it to, and it's

17:29.800 --> 17:35.200
kind of bad publicity for them when you've got a great free software project like KDE

17:35.200 --> 17:36.720
having issues with them.

17:36.720 --> 17:43.040
It was a very popular Twitter thread about it, and it has kind of really shone Google

17:43.040 --> 17:47.560
in a bit of a bad light when I think they were trying to do a good thing, really.

17:47.560 --> 17:51.560
Yeah, but I think that led to Google noticing a little bit quicker than they might have

17:51.560 --> 17:55.960
for the average bear, and he isn't the only developer that's run into these issues.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.880
There's been other developers that have been complaining about this, so I think Google

17:58.880 --> 18:02.160
is a little more incentivized to respond quickly right now.

18:02.160 --> 18:03.640
I mean, they've got a lot on their plate, Joe.

18:03.640 --> 18:08.640
They do have a lot on their plate, specifically with the EU, who have forced them into doing

18:08.640 --> 18:11.280
a browser choice on Android.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.880
So this seems a bit familiar, doesn't it?

18:13.880 --> 18:19.600
More and more these days, Google reminds me of an old, younger Microsoft.

18:19.600 --> 18:24.200
Now Google puts it on their blog, we're going to do more to ensure that Android phone owners

18:24.200 --> 18:29.000
know about the wide choice of browser and search engines available to download on their

18:29.000 --> 18:30.240
phones.

18:30.240 --> 18:35.880
This will involve asking users of existing and new Android devices in Europe which browser

18:35.880 --> 18:38.120
and search apps they'd like to use.

18:38.120 --> 18:43.120
It's funny how Google tried to spin it as a really good thing for the consumer and everything,

18:43.120 --> 18:47.860
but it doesn't take much to hear the gritted teeth through which they wrote that.

18:47.860 --> 18:52.560
And the fact that it's only in the EU means they were obviously forced to do it.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.840
And I don't know why they're pretending otherwise, really.

18:54.840 --> 18:58.760
Well, at this point, they're probably just trying to avoid more fines.

18:58.760 --> 19:04.900
In fact, I believe the European Commission just fined them another $1.49 billion for

19:04.900 --> 19:07.840
ad market monopoly practices.

19:07.840 --> 19:12.800
In fact, if you look at Google's numbers now, they're paying more in European Commission

19:12.800 --> 19:14.320
fines than they are taxes.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.280
Yeah, so this is starting to be more than pocket change to them.

19:17.280 --> 19:22.080
I mean, obviously they pay as little tax as possible, like all the giant corporations.

19:22.080 --> 19:26.160
But still, this must be really starting to register with them now that they just can't

19:26.160 --> 19:27.480
get away with this stuff.

19:27.480 --> 19:34.240
And the EU and the European Commission are just not going to stand for monopolistic practices.

19:34.240 --> 19:39.860
I mean, it does seem a bit hypocritical to not force Apple to have a browser choice because

19:39.860 --> 19:42.640
you buy an iPhone and that's got Safari, right?

19:42.640 --> 19:46.760
I mean, okay, fair enough, their business model isn't based on your search history and

19:46.760 --> 19:51.360
advertising and everything, but it's still somewhat hypocritical.

19:51.360 --> 19:55.240
It really does seem though to be like the trifecta that really gets them.

19:55.240 --> 20:00.480
It's the fact that it's their platform that they're charging OEMs for, it's their browser,

20:00.480 --> 20:04.200
and they're the leader in online advertising slash search.

20:04.200 --> 20:08.840
And those things seem to be what keep getting them on the radar.

20:08.840 --> 20:14.120
And they did some investigations showing that in March of 2009, Google began rolling out

20:14.120 --> 20:19.540
these exclusive contracts and clauses for premium placement of Google ads.

20:19.540 --> 20:24.920
They cite that as an example of Google pressing competitors down on the page into less valuable

20:24.920 --> 20:25.920
space.

20:25.920 --> 20:31.120
They say that in 2006, Google had exclusive clauses in certain contracts for providing

20:31.120 --> 20:36.680
search advertising to publishers and they had to only use Google search.

20:36.680 --> 20:40.860
And they say that's another example where Google prevented competitors from coming in

20:40.860 --> 20:45.920
and having a fair shot and that they were able to leverage their market position to

20:45.920 --> 20:50.940
get these contracts and these exclusive agreements or terms of service.

20:50.940 --> 20:56.240
You combine that with their 80% or whatever it is Android market share and now Chrome's

20:56.240 --> 21:00.700
dominance and Google search's dominance, I think I could see their case here.

21:00.700 --> 21:06.020
I don't know if I really feel like Google did anything evil to get in these positions.

21:06.020 --> 21:10.420
I think they've made pretty competitive products and the market has responded or they made

21:10.420 --> 21:13.840
it at least free in some cases and the market responded to that.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.960
And now that Google's made it to the top, it kind of feels like they're getting smacked

21:16.960 --> 21:19.280
down and getting charged and nickeled and dimed.

21:19.280 --> 21:21.960
But of course, that's just my Yankee capitalism perspective.

21:21.960 --> 21:24.480
Well, that's the thing about capitalism, right?

21:24.480 --> 21:29.520
It was their duty to their shareholders to make as much money as they possibly can.

21:29.520 --> 21:32.240
They're sort of legally obliged to do so.

21:32.240 --> 21:36.920
And so it's a very fine line that they have to tread here between making as much money

21:36.920 --> 21:42.960
as they can by essentially being anti-competitive with not getting slapped with huge fines,

21:42.960 --> 21:45.120
which impact their bottom line.

21:45.120 --> 21:48.000
They are large fines, you're right.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.320
But they're doing fine.

21:49.320 --> 21:55.880
I mean, you're talking this last one was 1 billion in 2017, it was 5.1 billion.

21:55.880 --> 21:59.920
It looks like Google is projecting another 50 million they have set aside for 2019.

21:59.920 --> 22:02.540
They now just have this broken out in their accounting.

22:02.540 --> 22:05.620
They have these, they do, yeah, they just have these commission fines broken out as

22:05.620 --> 22:08.540
part of their business operating costs.

22:08.540 --> 22:10.920
But they are a rich company.

22:10.920 --> 22:16.980
I believe they had an annual revenue last year of $136.8 billion.

22:16.980 --> 22:23.200
So 5 billion Hertz for sure, and another billion, that's not great, but they're doing okay.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.200
Yeah.

22:24.200 --> 22:29.600
So the rest of us have like, you know, gas money, internet, you know, electricity, whatever.

22:29.600 --> 22:34.200
They've got European Commission fines, that's budgeted out.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.960
That's the life of these companies, I guess.

22:36.960 --> 22:40.560
It's hard when, you know, you're doing business in these multiple domains now, and they're

22:40.560 --> 22:44.400
getting into more, like with video streaming and now game streaming.

22:44.400 --> 22:47.200
They're essentially becoming, they're becoming a gaming company.

22:47.200 --> 22:49.920
They're already a television company.

22:49.920 --> 22:53.960
And Amazon and Apple and Microsoft and others are all trying to do the same thing.

22:53.960 --> 22:57.040
So these European Commissioners are going to be busy for a long time.

22:57.040 --> 23:01.480
Yeah, it's just a shame that I won't be seeing any of that money in the UK.

23:01.480 --> 23:04.600
Oh, sore subject, I know.

23:04.600 --> 23:08.500
Well, this has been a pretty gaming heavy week because of the big gaming expo that just

23:08.500 --> 23:14.160
wrapped up, but every single week we are covering Linux and open source news right here on Linux

23:14.160 --> 23:15.160
Action News.

23:15.160 --> 23:18.760
Go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

23:18.760 --> 23:22.300
And go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact if you want to get in touch with us.

23:22.300 --> 23:24.600
Our Linux Fest Northwest community is growing.

23:24.600 --> 23:28.800
We have a telegram group set up, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash Linux Fest.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.440
We're going to give away some retro stickers.

23:30.440 --> 23:35.440
I say retro because pretty soon you're going to see some slick new logos rolling out for

23:35.440 --> 23:37.320
our Jupiter Broadcasting shows.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.240
So we figured we might as well do something with the stickers, right?

23:39.240 --> 23:41.240
So we're going to give them away.

23:41.240 --> 23:44.760
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Linux Fest if you want to join that thread and contribute

23:44.760 --> 23:49.240
positively to the conversation and maybe we'll use it for future fests as well.

23:49.240 --> 23:52.720
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

23:52.720 --> 23:54.480
I'm at chrislas.

23:54.480 --> 23:55.880
I'm at charrissington.

23:55.880 --> 23:58.480
Thank you for joining us and we'll see you next week.

23:58.480 --> 24:16.800
Take care, bye-bye, see you later.
