00:00.000 --> 00:09.400
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News episode 128 recorded on October 20th, 2019.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.400
I'm Chris.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.400
And I'm Drew.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.400
Hello, Drew.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.400
Good to be connected with you.

00:13.400 --> 00:16.440
Joe is away at Ogg Camp this week.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.440
He'll be back next week and Drew's filling in.

00:18.440 --> 00:25.440
And Drew, we start off with a huge new release from Canonical, Ubuntu 19.10 is out.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.720
Yeah, and it's pretty great too.

00:27.720 --> 00:33.880
I've been using it for the past week or so in the beta and really, this is just a super

00:33.880 --> 00:35.600
solid release.

00:35.600 --> 00:40.360
I am astounded by how polished everything is, even when it was in beta.

00:40.360 --> 00:45.720
Gnome Shell has reached just a new level of performance and 19.10 is one of the first

00:45.720 --> 00:48.420
distros out of the gate to showcase that.

00:48.420 --> 00:53.660
But also, you have your official flavors this release that are really looking good.

00:53.660 --> 01:01.360
One of my favorites, Ubuntu Mate 19.10 goes up to the Mate Desktop 1.22.2, Evolution replaces

01:01.360 --> 01:07.800
Thunderbird, MPV comes in to replace VLC, and there's a new updated Brisk menu as well.

01:07.800 --> 01:13.680
But Joe's favorites, Ubuntu also gets a great update, Budgie also, Kubuntu, all around,

01:13.680 --> 01:17.800
it's looking really great for the flavors and for the main distro.

01:17.800 --> 01:23.000
Because really, in a sense, it's getting everything positioned and ready for 2004, the next big

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
LTS.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.560
Well, yeah, they're getting everything all polished up and ready for their long term

01:28.560 --> 01:33.080
support release and is going to have at least five years of support.

01:33.080 --> 01:37.920
So you want to make sure that everything that goes into it is going to be rock solid.

01:37.920 --> 01:44.000
Because with the exception of adding in backport PPAs, that's going to be what they're going

01:44.000 --> 01:46.080
to be running for at least five years.

01:46.080 --> 01:51.000
Yeah, and perhaps even longer with extended support could be up to a decade in some cases.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.880
The most notable new feature in 1910 is obviously support for ZFS on route.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.320
It's a checkbox in the graphical installer.

01:58.320 --> 02:04.160
It is heavily couched as experimental in all caps in the installer.

02:04.160 --> 02:08.480
So they really want you to know that you are taking your data into your own hands when

02:08.480 --> 02:09.600
you try it.

02:09.600 --> 02:15.280
But under the hood, they're working on some really sophisticated layout options that as

02:15.280 --> 02:21.080
you would expect, accommodate not just the desktop, but also different kinds of server

02:21.080 --> 02:26.280
deployments, some that are automated that are clustered, as well as putting a layer

02:26.280 --> 02:31.540
in there called ZSYS, which will take care of a few of the fundamentals and works with

02:31.540 --> 02:36.600
things like a patched version of grub that allow you to boot directly from ZFS on your

02:36.600 --> 02:37.800
root partition.

02:37.800 --> 02:44.120
But even further from that down the road, you may be able to select snapshots of your

02:44.120 --> 02:48.960
system like you currently select kernels after you do an update.

02:48.960 --> 02:54.420
Something goes wrong, you reboot, select a two hour earlier snapshot, everything's right

02:54.420 --> 02:55.680
back to where it was.

02:55.680 --> 02:56.680
Right.

02:56.680 --> 03:01.700
And this is a feature that they are trying to borrow from the BSD world, something called

03:01.700 --> 03:08.020
boot environments, where you literally select the snapshot that ZFS took prior to you doing

03:08.020 --> 03:14.880
some crazy system upgrade or really just anything that could be a breaking change and allows

03:14.880 --> 03:19.940
you to just essentially roll back to the snapshot that you had before.

03:19.940 --> 03:23.580
It's a really good technology and I'm really looking forward to them integrating that into

03:23.580 --> 03:24.580
the system.

03:24.580 --> 03:27.680
I think it's going to be a game changer for Ubuntu down the line.

03:27.680 --> 03:33.460
Well, the idea would be that when 2004 ships, things like kernel updates and major system

03:33.460 --> 03:36.840
updates are no longer going to take your system out.

03:36.840 --> 03:40.840
It's going to make that much safer in an enterprise environment to deploy those updates.

03:40.840 --> 03:45.120
So there's a lot of really important things there, but there's so many other benefits

03:45.120 --> 03:49.480
like really good file system compression that can actually improve boot time and file read

03:49.480 --> 03:53.360
access, incredible data management options.

03:53.360 --> 03:59.160
I couldn't do it proper justice, but Jim Salter does in TechSnap 4.14.

03:59.160 --> 04:04.600
Go to TechSnap.Systems slash 4.14 and listen to rooting for ZFS.

04:04.600 --> 04:09.280
I think one of my favorite moments in that episode was when Jim explained how snapshots

04:09.280 --> 04:15.000
work in a way that is so totally understandable and it really clicked in my head why it doesn't

04:15.000 --> 04:20.200
consume tons and tons of disk space and why in some circumstances a snapshot can happen

04:20.200 --> 04:25.520
so quickly and how you really could just make it part of a package update script.

04:25.520 --> 04:28.640
So such a great episode TechSnap.Systems slash 4.14.

04:28.640 --> 04:33.360
Once you get 1910 installed, it is important to go ahead and do a full upgrade because

04:33.360 --> 04:38.320
there is an important kernel fix that was released after those images were spun.

04:38.320 --> 04:43.680
Yeah, it's an embarrassing bug too because it reminds me of a bug on Windows way back

04:43.680 --> 04:46.800
in the day where you could just blue screen a Windows system by sending it some packets

04:46.800 --> 04:47.960
of data.

04:47.960 --> 04:52.760
This is on that level and it took a little while for people to catch on to this bug because

04:52.760 --> 04:57.720
initially it was reported as a WireGuard bug and then we came to realize it's actually

04:57.720 --> 05:02.000
a kernel bug in the IPv6 stack and yeah, it's an issue.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.160
It's worth upgrading because people can just crash your machine.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.160
Yeah, definitely.

05:05.160 --> 05:07.080
You want to keep those machines nice and safe.

05:07.080 --> 05:12.680
We gave our first impressions in Linux Unplugged last week and since then we've been benchmarking

05:12.680 --> 05:20.380
a ZFS 1910 system versus an Extended 4 1910 system and how it performs in low memory conditions

05:20.380 --> 05:25.840
and just on like an average SSD, not like a super nice crazy MV&E, but we went and got

05:25.840 --> 05:29.720
like an EvoDrive that we've had for a couple of years and in that batch of testing one

05:29.720 --> 05:36.360
of the things I've discovered is that Canonical did spin an image for the Raspberry Pi 4,

05:36.360 --> 05:38.640
the 32-bit and a 64-bit.

05:38.640 --> 05:45.880
As we record the 64-bit version has an issue with, well, USB devices don't work, but it's

05:45.880 --> 05:47.960
reported and it's in their bug tracker.

05:47.960 --> 05:52.280
32-bit for my testing does not suffer, so the 32-bit image, you put that on Raspberry

05:52.280 --> 05:58.480
Pi 4 and you've got 1910 running on this tiny little arm board and that's going to be a

05:58.480 --> 06:05.240
really interesting story as well as 2004 comes out and we have a lot more types of arm devices

06:05.240 --> 06:11.680
on the market including the Pi 4, but also including Amazon's new bare metal arm instances.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.220
Yeah, this looks really cool.

06:14.220 --> 06:19.440
They're calling it the A1 family and it is powered by Graviton processors.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.320
I love these names, Drew.

06:21.320 --> 06:22.320
I know, right?

06:22.320 --> 06:23.920
I mean a Graviton processor?

06:23.920 --> 06:25.960
That sounds like something that would be in Star Trek.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.440
Yeah, it totally does.

06:28.440 --> 06:34.240
Graviton is saying that it's a great fit for scale-out workloads including web front-ends,

06:34.240 --> 06:36.920
containerized microservices or caching fleets.

06:36.920 --> 06:42.480
Right, and in some workloads they say you'll get a 45% cost savings because they're running

06:42.480 --> 06:47.480
these machines for less money and for the right applications it could make a lot of

06:47.480 --> 06:52.400
sense, including developers who are starting development on ARM can now move that ARM code

06:52.400 --> 06:54.840
up to machines running on EC2.

06:54.840 --> 07:01.480
This is a pretty big deal when Amazon starts doing this because it's one thing when Joe's

07:01.480 --> 07:09.460
hosting says, oh, by the way, I have ARM servers, but for Amazon to put this out in AWS where

07:09.460 --> 07:14.720
you can spin it up in minutes, this is a big boost for ARM.

07:14.720 --> 07:15.720
Right.

07:15.720 --> 07:20.840
When you are on EC2 you're also part of their entire stack of their monitoring and their

07:20.840 --> 07:25.360
messaging their entire ecosystem and the thing that's nice about having this on Metal is

07:25.360 --> 07:29.560
you run your own distro and they write even in their announcement about it just run a

07:29.560 --> 07:34.720
distribution like Ubuntu, Red Hat, Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux, Enterprise Server or Debian

07:34.720 --> 07:39.840
and of course Amazon's Linux 2 is available as well and you tie that in with their whole

07:39.840 --> 07:43.800
orchestration and management platform and if you're a shop there's a lot of them out

07:43.800 --> 07:47.820
there these days that has nearly their entire data center on Amazon.

07:47.820 --> 07:52.160
This is just now one more system you can deploy and I think it's going to be a big boom for

07:52.160 --> 07:57.200
ARM code on Linux as well which is really still not quite up to parity with the x86

07:57.200 --> 07:58.200
counterpart.

07:58.200 --> 08:03.720
That's true but changes are coming and Docker has announced support for ARM based architectures

08:03.720 --> 08:06.100
with their Docker Enterprise Edition.

08:06.100 --> 08:12.000
So while it feels like ARM support has been growing slowly it is really starting to get

08:12.000 --> 08:16.800
there and I think the future holds of just a world of possibilities for ARM.

08:16.800 --> 08:20.920
Yeah imagine like the edge network stuff a lot of enterprise-grade applications that

08:20.920 --> 08:25.480
are just doing a couple of things here and there and they don't need an entire stack

08:25.480 --> 08:31.120
but that hasn't necessarily translated to big profits for IBM in the enterprise in fact

08:31.120 --> 08:37.560
IBM has missed their estimates even as Red Hat was added didn't really offset the declines

08:37.560 --> 08:42.080
their total revenue was down 3.9% from a year earlier.

08:42.080 --> 08:51.120
Analysts had forecast 18.2 billion dollars and IBM got close but just missed it and doesn't

08:51.120 --> 08:53.880
really seem like Red Hat made a huge difference does it?

08:53.880 --> 08:59.240
No it doesn't but I kind of have to wonder how quickly did they expect the Red Hat purchase

08:59.240 --> 09:03.320
to really change things and turn it around at IBM.

09:03.320 --> 09:09.080
These kinds of acquisitions are big business and they do take time to really start taking

09:09.080 --> 09:10.080
effect.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.920
Absolutely in fact in a way like they should be getting a pat on the back for it not being

09:13.920 --> 09:18.720
worse during a merger like everything's crazy you know people are figuring out their stuff

09:18.720 --> 09:22.800
I mean I can only imagine our merger had lots of little details we had to sort out and we

09:22.800 --> 09:25.600
were a tiny little company and this is Red Hat.

09:25.600 --> 09:29.960
There's so many things they have to sort there's so many additional meetings the cognitive

09:29.960 --> 09:36.280
overhead of a merger at this scale is massive and so I mean in one way you could spin this

09:36.280 --> 09:41.880
and say I'm surprised that they weren't much worse but I think it does also represent what

09:41.880 --> 09:46.680
kind of a small impact Red Hat's revenues make to IBM's bottom line because this is

09:46.680 --> 09:51.760
really the first time we've seen Red Hat included in the results since the 2018 purchase so

09:51.760 --> 09:56.440
like we see the first results of this in this quarter and it's kind of well it's nothing

09:56.440 --> 10:00.800
yet it really is nothing yet but I think you're right time will tell won't it?

10:00.800 --> 10:07.320
It will and to be fair Red Hat's revenue was up from what it was projected at this year.

10:07.320 --> 10:12.880
Realistically I think that the Red Hat merger is showing promise I think we just need to

10:12.880 --> 10:18.560
give it a little more time yeah and in fact Chief Financial Officer Jim Cavanaugh said

10:18.560 --> 10:22.920
in an interview that he expects IBM will be back to a sustained level of revenue growth

10:22.920 --> 10:24.240
in 2020.

10:24.240 --> 10:28.840
Yeah look we love to give IBM a hard time a little bit because they're sort of the suits

10:28.840 --> 10:33.640
but there's other factors here that are maybe things that we don't track as clearly and

10:33.640 --> 10:38.000
that's things like foreign currency and how the shifts in the foreign currency markets

10:38.000 --> 10:45.400
can just affect IBM's overall results or their global IT company starts having poor performance

10:45.400 --> 10:50.400
in Ireland for the last few quarters and it has impacted their results and none of it

10:50.400 --> 10:55.080
has anything to do with Red Hat or what their success is in the cloud.

10:55.080 --> 11:00.440
Really and you also have to take into account that IBM is massive they have all kinds of

11:00.440 --> 11:04.800
departments doing all kinds of different things and if any one of them underperforms from

11:04.800 --> 11:09.600
what they were projected that does affect the total company's bottom line.

11:09.600 --> 11:14.080
You know Drew when you say all that global markets and currencies and all of this it

11:14.080 --> 11:19.180
man it really strikes me how far open source software has come like it's powering massive

11:19.180 --> 11:23.800
massive businesses now and time really does tell all stories so we'll see where this

11:23.800 --> 11:31.200
goes and now we have an update with Samsung's grand attempt to put Linux on DeX and it's

11:31.200 --> 11:32.200
not good.

11:32.200 --> 11:36.680
Yeah bad news coming from Samsung they sent out an email to all of the Linux for DeX beta

11:36.680 --> 11:40.920
participants saying that they are ending support for Linux on DeX.

11:40.920 --> 11:44.560
Now if you're listening you're going what the heck is DeX guys well this debuted back

11:44.560 --> 11:51.220
in 2017 with the Samsung Galaxy S8 it let you get a desktop mode UI when you put it

11:51.220 --> 11:56.100
in their special DeX station which had connectors on the back of it and then later with the

11:56.100 --> 12:01.480
launch of the Galaxy Note 9 they made it work with any HDMI to USB-C type cable which meant

12:01.480 --> 12:07.360
you didn't need the dock anymore and they also started testing Linux on DeX which enabled

12:07.360 --> 12:14.320
the user to get a full-fledged Linux desktop running on the smartphone in DeX mode specifically

12:14.320 --> 12:20.480
Linux on DeX supported a modified Ubuntu 1604 LTS for ARM 64.

12:20.480 --> 12:26.600
Yeah and it looks like that program is going away with Android 10 they have noted that

12:26.600 --> 12:31.600
Linux on DeX will not be supported on Android 10 beta once you update your device to Android

12:31.600 --> 12:37.640
OS 10 you will not be able to perform a version rollback to Android Pi if you decide to update

12:37.640 --> 12:43.480
your device to Android 10 beta we recommend backing up before updating.

12:43.480 --> 12:46.400
Yeah this is not going to be a thing anymore.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.960
They decided not to graduate it to a product you know they tried it out as a beta and they

12:49.960 --> 12:56.640
said now we're not going to do it to be honest I never really saw the appeal I mean if you

12:56.640 --> 13:02.760
look at me I might be the perfect ideal candidate to buy something like this like I like getting

13:02.760 --> 13:08.880
me a fancy smartphone I love the idea of a mobile usable workstation that's in my pocket

13:08.880 --> 13:13.580
I'd be willing to invest in a dock I mean a hell I bought Thunderbolt docks I'll buy

13:13.580 --> 13:20.360
a DeX dock even if I had to or a USB C to HDMI cable with a Bluetooth keyboard I do that

13:20.360 --> 13:25.440
but I think just instinctively I knew it was never really going to be up to my expectations

13:25.440 --> 13:32.560
and performance and I've come to a new a new place with how I use my mobile devices and

13:32.560 --> 13:37.160
how I use my desktops and how I divvy up those tasks and I'm pretty comfortable with it.

13:37.160 --> 13:43.280
I'm kind of of two minds here I think it's a really great idea the whole idea of convergence

13:43.280 --> 13:49.640
of being able to walk around with your computer on your cell phone you plug it into a workstation

13:49.640 --> 13:54.920
and all of a sudden you've got your desktop so you could travel from home to the office

13:54.920 --> 14:00.160
and have the same computer without having to lug around a laptop or anything like that

14:00.160 --> 14:06.360
it's a really cool idea but I think we also have to recognize that it's 2019 now and almost

14:06.360 --> 14:12.400
2020 and more and more people are doing more stuff on mobile.

14:12.400 --> 14:16.840
The mobile devices battery lives haven't significantly improved the OS is still aren't really quite

14:16.840 --> 14:22.040
fast enough like you don't have enough horsepower to use it as a desktop apps that are designed

14:22.040 --> 14:26.720
for mobile use like a banking app that's a mobile app that makes sense but hooking up

14:26.720 --> 14:31.640
to a whole screen I just I don't think it's there I mean do you really think it's you

14:31.640 --> 14:36.240
really think it is honestly I don't think it's there now but I think the potential to

14:36.240 --> 14:42.240
make something great out of it really would be there if we hadn't seen such a global shift

14:42.240 --> 14:48.260
towards mobile only computer over the last few years really I think that's what's killing

14:48.260 --> 14:55.440
Linux on decks and things like Ubuntu touch which had a very similar idea but as we all

14:55.440 --> 15:01.080
know that's one that we can say rest in peace to okay I see what you're saying you're saying

15:01.080 --> 15:05.480
mobile has gotten competent enough that you don't need to snap it into a desktop mode

15:05.480 --> 15:11.200
that's right I mean just look at the success of you know Chromebooks they're not running

15:11.200 --> 15:16.680
full on Linux and granted you can get Linux apps running on them but for the most part

15:16.680 --> 15:21.840
people are using them like bigger cell phones what's funny about this is we're both skeptics

15:21.840 --> 15:27.620
but for totally opposite reasons see my argument is the desktop has stayed competitive has

15:27.620 --> 15:32.760
gotten better and faster in fact in a lot of ways it's better than it's ever been when

15:32.760 --> 15:39.120
you get a like a full rise in system and or even just a system with an AMD GPU and you

15:39.120 --> 15:42.440
can run Wayland and you have to you didn't have to install a single driver and you get

15:42.440 --> 15:46.600
full 3d acceleration it's really getting to be the next level now in the Linux desktop

15:46.600 --> 15:51.080
it's it's better than it has been at any point in time that I've ever been doing this and

15:51.080 --> 15:54.800
the hardware is getting good again as well and so are laptops they're getting really

15:54.800 --> 15:59.400
competitive again Intel and AMD are back at each other's throats again like I feel like

15:59.400 --> 16:04.980
the desktop and the laptop space is more competitive and has moved forward more in the last couple

16:04.980 --> 16:10.600
of years than it has in the instance mobile became a thing and so in a sense it hasn't

16:10.600 --> 16:14.240
stood still is just going slow for a little bit now it's in gear and so I think the gaps

16:14.240 --> 16:18.660
getting wider again and I think you're right about that I just think that the train has

16:18.660 --> 16:27.040
left the station as far as being able to really capture I don't want to say desktop usage

16:27.040 --> 16:30.840
it's like that good enough usage though where it's like it's fast enough I can do everything

16:30.840 --> 16:37.960
I need usage yeah absolutely and for most people mobile or mobile like experiences are

16:37.960 --> 16:42.200
good enough what do most people want they want to check their email they want to browse

16:42.200 --> 16:47.520
the web it's the people like us the people who like to mess with computers who really

16:47.520 --> 16:52.320
love this stuff right yeah all right I agree and I I think that's why the Linux for decks

16:52.320 --> 16:57.320
didn't quite click for me because it was clearly going after the more advanced user being Linux

16:57.320 --> 17:00.320
and the fact that you had to go get this thing and install it on your phone and even know

17:00.320 --> 17:04.320
that it had this capability to begin with all of those probably put you in a more advanced

17:04.320 --> 17:09.040
category and then when you get to that category well we got a whole heck of requirements you

17:09.040 --> 17:12.240
know we got a whole bunch of requirements the first thing is somebody's gonna want to

17:12.240 --> 17:17.680
put i3 on that thing and the packages wouldn't be available they'd be out oh yeah absolutely

17:17.680 --> 17:23.340
but you know all is not lost there is Maru OS still out there and they're still targeting

17:23.340 --> 17:29.540
convergence so you know people who do still have that dream where you can walk around

17:29.540 --> 17:33.480
with your computer in your pocket and just connect it up to something and get going it's

17:33.480 --> 17:41.400
not completely dead yet well drew my dream is software distribution that's truly safe

17:41.400 --> 17:47.600
we're not there yet it looks like a crypto jacking worm was found inside images on DockerHub

17:47.600 --> 17:52.880
yeah this is bad news for DockerHub and the Docker project at large having this kind of

17:52.880 --> 17:59.280
malware attack the system is not a good thing now to their credit I can't find any of these

17:59.280 --> 18:04.720
Docker images on DockerHub anymore so it does look like they've been pulled but who knows

18:04.720 --> 18:10.220
if they've uploaded some other malicious images under some other name so this graboid malware

18:10.220 --> 18:15.300
works kind of interestingly and kind of wonky at the same time it carries out its worm spreading

18:15.300 --> 18:22.080
and crypto jacking by randomly picking three targets on each run iteration it installs

18:22.080 --> 18:25.940
the worm on the first target it stops the miner on the second target and it starts

18:25.940 --> 18:32.140
the miner on a third target this procedure leads to a random kind of mining behavior

18:32.140 --> 18:36.860
and if a host is compromised the malicious container doesn't necessarily start immediately

18:36.860 --> 18:40.360
so you don't necessarily see anything at boot time that would draw your attention the container

18:40.360 --> 18:47.340
runs for a little bit and then the other compromised hosts can randomly stop other mining processes

18:47.340 --> 18:54.000
so essentially the miner on every infected host is randomly controlled by all the other

18:54.000 --> 19:00.060
infected hosts and unit 42 the people who discovered the worm said that they really

19:00.060 --> 19:07.600
can't determine why the miners are deployed and run and stopped so randomly is it just

19:07.600 --> 19:13.000
bad design or do they have some other goal that we don't necessarily understand yet

19:13.000 --> 19:18.800
palo alto networks has a great breakdown that we will have linked in the show notes at linuxactionnews.com

19:18.800 --> 19:24.380
slash 128 when you look at the overall scale of docker hub this issue still kind of remains

19:24.380 --> 19:28.880
to be a little more on the theoretical edge i know it's even like you know nearly 10,000

19:28.880 --> 19:33.260
image downloads have happened so it's real and that's a lot of people but docker image

19:33.260 --> 19:38.420
deployments are on the scale of millions in some cases even billions and just like in

19:38.420 --> 19:44.740
the aur there is the theoretical risk which there has been bad stuff in the aur before

19:44.740 --> 19:50.900
if you use the entire suite of tools around the software including looking at how many

19:50.900 --> 19:57.760
other downloads or in this case polls or looking at the comments or all the other attributes

19:57.760 --> 20:03.740
you can analyze like publishers etc you are able to build a more complete picture and

20:03.740 --> 20:08.760
essentially get a better idea of if you can trust the author or not and you combine that

20:08.760 --> 20:14.720
with industry best practices and it just doesn't really feel like a huge issue to me it's not

20:14.720 --> 20:19.700
one that i worry about on my systems but i'm also willing to put a few minutes of research

20:19.700 --> 20:24.300
into an image before i deploy it on a production system well yeah you absolutely have to if

20:24.300 --> 20:29.600
you want to stay secure you can't just trust everything you see out there you want to make

20:29.600 --> 20:36.060
sure that your images or software are coming from reputable sources at the very least well

20:36.060 --> 20:40.740
let's talk about the hard time google's been giving free software projects that are attempting

20:40.740 --> 20:46.260
to raise donations two fairly important projects were removed from the play store this week

20:46.260 --> 20:52.520
we start with and otp and otp was pulled from the google play store by google after they

20:52.520 --> 21:00.060
introduced a donation button and it cost a bit of a stir this is an open source project

21:00.060 --> 21:05.060
that is not necessarily wanting to charge for itself but would like to allow people

21:05.060 --> 21:10.220
to give money to it and google says that's not okay i also i kind of don't like this

21:10.220 --> 21:15.820
because in both circumstances the one we're about to talk about and this one these applications

21:15.820 --> 21:21.760
improve the android ecosystem security and otp is a fabulous two-factor authentication

21:21.760 --> 21:27.880
app for android and it supports devices down to 4.4 which a lot of developers have abandoned

21:27.880 --> 21:33.040
at this point and it's a solid implementation of a time-based one-time password or other

21:33.040 --> 21:37.100
systems as well you got an hmac based one you can just scan the qr code it automatically

21:37.100 --> 21:41.980
will get all of that set up it's a really nice user experience and the developer is

21:41.980 --> 21:47.020
just trying to make it sustainable i completely agree i don't see anything wrong with having

21:47.020 --> 21:53.940
some kind of donation service within an app that just lets people give back to a project

21:53.940 --> 22:00.340
especially one as beneficial as and otp or wire guard which was also removed from the

22:00.340 --> 22:05.680
google play store for the same thing this is really upsetting because again wire guard

22:05.680 --> 22:09.620
is some really great software personally one of my favorite open source projects in the

22:09.620 --> 22:15.900
last couple of years and a similar story here they added a link to wire guard dot com slash

22:15.900 --> 22:20.980
donations which we should all go to now that google has forced them to remove it just adding

22:20.980 --> 22:25.740
that link which would open the user's web browser to do a donation google so it was

22:25.740 --> 22:32.540
in violation of their payment policy in the google play store yes and both projects are

22:32.540 --> 22:39.980
back up on google play now that they've removed their donation links but really how bad is

22:39.980 --> 22:45.860
it to have a donation button i mean they're not forcing people to pay for the software

22:45.860 --> 22:50.900
they're not doing anything other than just routing people to a website that asks for

22:50.900 --> 22:55.180
a little bit of money it's really unfortunate especially when you're just talking about

22:55.180 --> 22:59.620
a link that opens the web browser i mean for goodness sakes the ios version has it it's

22:59.620 --> 23:04.020
nice and prominent with a little heart emoji in the setting screen and you tap it and it

23:04.020 --> 23:09.740
opens up a web browser to their donate page ios has it like it feels like this should

23:09.740 --> 23:15.060
be a story about apple and here we're talking about google in my opinion these actions have

23:15.060 --> 23:20.580
elevated f-droid to a whole nother level of prominence in the open source community thank

23:20.580 --> 23:25.780
goodness we have another alternative and one that is friendly to open source because during

23:25.780 --> 23:31.660
both of these pollings from the play store f-droid of course kept the apps with the donation

23:31.660 --> 23:37.700
links absolutely and i personally think that it shows a lot of backwards thinking on the

23:37.700 --> 23:42.300
part of google with more and more software going towards services like patreon to support

23:42.300 --> 23:49.420
themselves we really need to be helping these businesses generate revenue in ways that are

23:49.420 --> 23:53.380
friendly towards the open source community the lead wire guard developer jason donofield

23:53.380 --> 23:58.340
commented quote we won't be making any similar changes unless we are certain that we won't

23:58.340 --> 24:04.060
be delisted again yeah i couldn't see any way for them to survive if they're not in

24:04.060 --> 24:10.960
the play store i mean granted the technology itself would survive in servers and desktops

24:10.960 --> 24:18.020
and ios but if people aren't able to take advantage of it on android they're gonna go

24:18.020 --> 24:23.580
somewhere else yeah they'll use something that's perhaps proprietary or it's a some

24:23.580 --> 24:31.420
weird implementation that spies on them wire guard is good audited free software that implements

24:31.420 --> 24:37.100
really good crypto and a great vpn technology and i think as we start to see really solid

24:37.100 --> 24:40.500
commercial solutions wrapped around it it's going to be a no-brainer and eventually it'll

24:40.500 --> 24:45.560
be just a detail you'll get an app that uses wire guard and you'll just have the peace

24:45.560 --> 24:50.740
of mind of knowing that the underlying software is open source and has been reviewed and is

24:50.740 --> 24:54.860
continued to be reviewed and i think that's the real long-term benefit that wire guard

24:54.860 --> 24:59.680
offers even average users on android they may not even know they're using it but they'll

24:59.680 --> 25:06.000
get something that's good reliable that supports a mobile connection way better than current

25:06.000 --> 25:12.060
vpns do with its super easy handling of getting disconnected and reconnected it's just an

25:12.060 --> 25:16.060
up and down of an interface and it it makes it so smooth i could go on and on obviously

25:16.060 --> 25:19.920
i love it and i just think it's critically important that google supports things like

25:19.920 --> 25:25.440
two-factor authentication and vpn technologies and pulling these two applications simply

25:25.440 --> 25:30.100
because they had links to donations well it's it's a clear step beyond what even apple would

25:30.100 --> 25:34.700
do and i i just don't know where that leaves us because of the prominence of the play store

25:34.700 --> 25:39.540
it leaves me uncomfortable well when these types of stories break we cover them in linux

25:39.540 --> 25:44.080
