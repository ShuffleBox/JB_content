Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:15.880 --> 00:20.160
This is episode 56, recorded on June 3rd, 2018.

00:20.160 --> 00:21.160
I'm Chris.

00:21.160 --> 00:22.160
And I'm Joe.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.160
Hello, Joe.

00:23.160 --> 00:26.560
It's good to be connected with you from Cortez, Colorado, and it's great to kick things off

00:26.560 --> 00:28.480
with a Linux hardware story.

00:28.480 --> 00:32.600
Yeah, the Atari VCS, which I think we talked about on one of the very first episodes of

00:32.600 --> 00:38.720
Linux Action News, that is finally on IndieGoGo, and it's doing incredibly well.

00:38.720 --> 00:42.920
They've smashed through their target, so this thing is definitely happening.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.040
Smashed it they have, Joe.

00:44.040 --> 00:50.800
They've raised 2,418% of their original $100,000 goal as we record this episode, and something

00:50.800 --> 00:52.780
tells me it's going to go up from there.

00:52.780 --> 00:58.440
You might kind of remember this story because it was teased as the Atari box in June of

00:58.440 --> 01:01.440
2017 by Atari at E3.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.520
Now we have a little more information, and I thought it would be interesting to go into

01:04.520 --> 01:11.620
the background of it because the Atari VCS really started as the brainchild of an individual

01:11.620 --> 01:17.300
who joined Atari with the intention of releasing a box like this after his observations of

01:17.300 --> 01:22.120
players that were connecting laptops to televisions to play games on larger screens, and then

01:22.120 --> 01:26.400
were using things like Skype and Twitter to do multiplayer gaming communication.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.700
He thought they had good brand recognition with this group.

01:29.700 --> 01:34.240
If they could put something in a box together that they could sell, it might actually have

01:34.240 --> 01:35.240
some demand.

01:35.240 --> 01:39.040
Lots of speculation online by YouTubers and others if anything like this could ever be

01:39.040 --> 01:46.240
successful, but this funding seems to indicate there is a massive audience for this, 9,321

01:46.240 --> 01:48.200
backers as of this recording.

01:48.200 --> 01:49.840
And so why are we talking about this?

01:49.840 --> 01:54.000
Because it's going to run Ubuntu or at least an operating system that is based on Ubuntu.

01:54.000 --> 01:57.200
Yes, specifically they named Ubuntu Linux.

01:57.200 --> 02:02.240
Now the original details of this box also back in 2017 kind of indicated that Linux

02:02.240 --> 02:03.880
was going to be under the hood.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.400
The hardware is nice.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.900
It's a x86 platform.

02:06.900 --> 02:14.000
It's going to use an AMD CPU and an AMD graphics unit, and it's a custom AMD A10 CPU, and it

02:14.000 --> 02:19.020
has about the performance of a mid-range 2017 gaming desktop.

02:19.020 --> 02:23.760
Also in 2018 or 2019 when this thing ships, it's not going to be the most competitive

02:23.760 --> 02:28.240
hardware spec wise, but like most consoles, that's not the only feature of the box.

02:28.240 --> 02:33.520
Yeah, it's only got four gigabytes of RAM as well, which even in 2018 feels a little

02:33.520 --> 02:34.520
bit low.

02:34.520 --> 02:39.240
And I think next year when this actually ships, that's going to be even lower, isn't it?

02:39.240 --> 02:45.360
It's going to seem like very old specs, but if you are using this thing to play old emulated

02:45.360 --> 02:47.800
games, then that's going to be plenty.

02:47.800 --> 02:52.440
But if you kind of look into play more modern games and it is going to support Steam, then

02:52.440 --> 02:56.080
you're going to be pretty limited in terms of what you can play with it.

02:56.080 --> 02:58.520
Yeah, it's not really clear on that part.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.800
So there's a couple of things in here that piqued up my interest.

03:00.800 --> 03:05.140
They said that you're going to have access to the quote Linux sandbox, and you can add

03:05.140 --> 03:09.880
more storage via cloud or USB, and you'll be able to run multiple operating systems

03:09.880 --> 03:16.360
quote at once, load homebrew games, and customize your own unique platform.

03:16.360 --> 03:22.920
It's ambiguous, but the language seems to indicate that this thing is going to be somewhat

03:22.920 --> 03:27.160
hackable by the community, even if it is within certain confines like a VM.

03:27.160 --> 03:31.680
They also indicate that there's going to be some large partner that will quote thrill

03:31.680 --> 03:35.320
gamers that they can't announce yet, but it's in the works.

03:35.320 --> 03:39.800
And by the time this box ships, they'll apparently have a partnership with an additional game

03:39.800 --> 03:40.800
library.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.160
I would love for that to be somebody like GOG who has a bunch of great old games, could

03:44.160 --> 03:46.520
go perfect on an Atari system like this.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.920
But it's funny that they point out several times that this thing is running Linux, and

03:49.920 --> 03:55.120
they use the word Linux and open source, and then they proudly say that their UI is a proprietary

03:55.120 --> 03:57.040
Atari UI on top of it.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.680
It's a very strange structure position there.

03:59.680 --> 04:03.400
Yeah, it's because they're proud of their branding and the artwork and the retro look

04:03.400 --> 04:05.340
and feel they think they've come up with.

04:05.340 --> 04:06.560
They think they've nailed that.

04:06.560 --> 04:11.120
Yeah, it does look really cool, especially the wooden one, which is slightly more expensive.

04:11.120 --> 04:14.520
But even the black one that's a couple of hundred dollars if you buy it or if you back

04:14.520 --> 04:18.440
it soon, that looks pretty cool as well.

04:18.440 --> 04:23.960
But looking down the details of this, there are a couple of red flags, I'm afraid.

04:23.960 --> 04:29.680
One of them was that they talk about Linux Ubuntu, which is like, okay, fair enough.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.120
And they don't mention what version of Ubuntu.

04:32.120 --> 04:36.520
But then if you dig down a bit further, it says that it's going to be based on the 4.10

04:36.520 --> 04:47.160
kernel, which I hope that that is a communication mistake because the 4.10 kernel is going out

04:47.160 --> 04:48.160
of support.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.600
Well, it has gone out of support.

04:49.600 --> 04:55.240
And the only Ubuntu version that shipped with 4.10 was 17.04, which as we know, is out of

04:55.240 --> 04:56.680
support as well.

04:56.680 --> 05:02.400
So surely that was just a mistake and maybe a prototype and they're going to be basing

05:02.400 --> 05:06.480
this thing on Ubuntu 18.04, please.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.480
Maybe.

05:07.480 --> 05:12.120
Ubuntu Core, the distribution itself, is based on 16.04 right now.

05:12.120 --> 05:13.800
So that would be a pretty good step.

05:13.800 --> 05:17.200
It would be, I guess, a downgrade if they're on 17.10 in some senses.

05:17.200 --> 05:21.360
But I would be willing to bet that's not going to change.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.060
That seems to be the way these things go.

05:23.060 --> 05:24.800
And that's a version two problem to solve.

05:24.800 --> 05:28.200
Well, so you seriously think they're going to ship this thing with an out of date kernel

05:28.200 --> 05:33.000
and an out of date OS that isn't supported and take on the burden of all of the support

05:33.000 --> 05:38.280
rather than basing it on an Ubuntu LTS and just having all that taken care of for them

05:38.280 --> 05:40.280
and then they only have to worry about their bits.

05:40.280 --> 05:42.040
Yeah, that's a really good point.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.040
I don't know.

05:43.040 --> 05:46.960
I think that would be a mistake if they didn't take care of that before they shipped this

05:46.960 --> 05:47.960
thing.

05:47.960 --> 05:51.880
And keep in mind, too, we're talking this time in 2019.

05:51.880 --> 05:55.300
So this thing is going to be even older by that point.

05:55.300 --> 05:58.060
And I think it's even more critical when you consider that.

05:58.060 --> 05:59.760
So I think you raise a really good point.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.120
Were there other red flags that you saw?

06:01.120 --> 06:04.480
Because I think that was the singular one that caught my attention.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.000
So I'm curious if you saw others.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.740
The other red flag was they talked about secure boot.

06:09.740 --> 06:13.880
Now if that is using a standard EFI where you can turn secure boot off and then boot

06:13.880 --> 06:16.640
whatever you want on it, then that's all well and good.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.200
But otherwise, you mentioned VMs.

06:19.200 --> 06:23.320
That might be the only way you can run an alternative operating system on this.

06:23.320 --> 06:29.920
And the fact that it may well be running an outdated version of Ubuntu and an old kernel

06:29.920 --> 06:33.680
means that people are quite likely to want to be able to hack this thing.

06:33.680 --> 06:38.760
And if it's not completely hackable, then that's just going to suck, I think.

06:38.760 --> 06:42.120
I think this is going to be the device that has the most potential, if you look at this

06:42.120 --> 06:44.200
category of hardware boxes.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.600
The Nvidia Shield, I think, could also be in this category.

06:47.600 --> 06:51.680
Atari is hinting that this thing's going to be a video streaming platform machine as well.

06:51.680 --> 06:55.760
And that's where it has some serious potential, in my estimation.

06:55.760 --> 07:02.120
If you could throw Kodi and Plex and MB and a couple of choice streaming apps onto this

07:02.120 --> 07:04.840
thing, then all of a sudden you've got yourself a real winner.

07:04.840 --> 07:08.480
And realistically, you could solve most of those just by allowing the Kodi app.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.720
And I suspect, having looked into the background of the individual who's really driving this

07:11.720 --> 07:15.320
project at Atari, I think they're clever enough to recognize that.

07:15.320 --> 07:16.600
They sort of looked at the Ouya.

07:16.600 --> 07:21.000
I don't know if you remember that tiny little arm cube, the Ouya, that was going to be the

07:21.000 --> 07:25.480
big gaming platform based on Android.

07:25.480 --> 07:31.320
The individual behind the Atari box, and now the VCS, is trying to really grok a lot of

07:31.320 --> 07:33.340
lessons from their failure.

07:33.340 --> 07:37.780
And he identifies a few of them in different talks, and I think he's dead on.

07:37.780 --> 07:40.640
So I think their fundamentals are good here.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.940
I think they're going to allow some customization.

07:42.940 --> 07:48.000
We just don't have the answers because I think, like you may have just sussed out, the person

07:48.000 --> 07:52.680
that wrote this up doesn't really have any idea about what they're writing.

07:52.680 --> 07:58.800
The few other things that I thought were interesting, USB-C for charging the peripherals has a really

07:58.800 --> 08:03.360
interesting design that I think is worth going to look at the Indiegogo page and check it

08:03.360 --> 08:06.040
out for yourself, the way they've put this thing together.

08:06.040 --> 08:11.860
And it's potentially, if you're down with some retro gaming and you want a media box

08:11.860 --> 08:16.300
to do some streaming, maybe just going to be good on its own as it is now.

08:16.300 --> 08:18.840
So with that in mind, I backed it.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.080
I don't normally do this anymore.

08:20.080 --> 08:25.920
In fact, I kind of have taken a break for about two years from backing anything on fundraisers,

08:25.920 --> 08:29.900
but I got a pretty good feeling that Atari is going to pull this thing off.

08:29.900 --> 08:35.640
And they say in their fact, this really is a pre-order in a sense because they have units.

08:35.640 --> 08:39.340
They're now just trying to get a feel for the market's interest.

08:39.340 --> 08:40.880
If that's true or not, who knows?

08:40.880 --> 08:42.960
But I have a pretty good sense they're going to actually deliver.

08:42.960 --> 08:48.120
So I backed the collector's edition, the one that comes with the limited wood inserts on

08:48.120 --> 08:50.400
the front and back, which reminds me of the original Atari.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.400
So I had to go for that.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.880
I just got the one with the joystick because I figured I'm going to give this thing a go.

08:54.880 --> 08:55.880
It's a Linux box.

08:55.880 --> 09:00.560
I could potentially replace an Android Nvidia Shield TV with this in my home.

09:00.560 --> 09:04.760
And I'd be a lot happier running something that's based on Ubuntu than I am Android TV.

09:04.760 --> 09:07.320
And then I can share my experiences with the audience.

09:07.320 --> 09:08.320
We'll see what happens.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.320
Yeah.

09:09.320 --> 09:14.820
Well, I look forward to hearing your review of it in a year's time.

09:14.820 --> 09:17.880
So things are not looking too good for Endless.

09:17.880 --> 09:23.600
At least three of their employees have been let go, I assume made redundant, including

09:23.600 --> 09:29.100
Michael Hall, who used to be the community manager over at Ubuntu working for Canonical.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.780
And then he moved over to Endless.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.520
And he's been doing great work over there.

09:33.520 --> 09:37.960
I mean, you just were talking about a post that he made recently on Linux Unplugged,

09:37.960 --> 09:38.960
weren't you?

09:38.960 --> 09:43.960
And now suddenly he's announcing on Twitter that he's looking for another job.

09:43.960 --> 09:47.960
And if you dig into it a little bit deeper, you see that he is not alone.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.240
There are a fair few other people.

09:50.240 --> 09:55.500
And it looks like Endless are in trouble, I think, which is a bit of a shame.

09:55.500 --> 09:59.620
This really caught me by surprise because on May 15th, Michael Hall had just posted

09:59.620 --> 10:05.560
the news about Endless 3.40, the big new update to Endless, which brought in a whole bunch

10:05.560 --> 10:10.960
of new stuff, including a newer version of GNOME, new applications, a new effort to build

10:10.960 --> 10:14.040
Android apps that tie in back to the Endless desktop.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.020
It really seemed like things were moving in the right direction.

10:17.020 --> 10:22.600
So just a few days later, to see him announce his availability for hire, as he put it, I

10:22.600 --> 10:23.600
was surprised.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.640
This isn't totally uncommon in the startup world.

10:25.640 --> 10:26.640
These things happen.

10:26.640 --> 10:27.640
They change direction.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.880
They pivot, as they say.

10:29.880 --> 10:34.200
But it is a little concerning when the community manager is laid off.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.480
That's kind of sending a message about some of their future intentions.

10:37.480 --> 10:41.440
Yeah, well, it looks like they just haven't been able to continue to get the investment

10:41.440 --> 10:42.440
that they needed.

10:42.440 --> 10:47.320
They've had a fair bit of VC funding over the last few years, and it looks like that's

10:47.320 --> 10:48.320
dried up.

10:48.320 --> 10:53.260
And to be perfectly honest, I'm not hugely surprised about that because their whole business

10:53.260 --> 11:01.860
model was based on an operating system that was aimed at the developing world for laptops

11:01.860 --> 11:02.860
or desktops.

11:02.860 --> 11:09.840
And the only products they've ever sold are kind of NUC-type devices that need extra peripherals.

11:09.840 --> 11:16.640
And they're trying to sell that to a market that skipped the whole desktop x86 computing

11:16.640 --> 11:20.260
generation and went straight for mobile.

11:20.260 --> 11:25.720
So how can they possibly hope to get a foot in that market when that market doesn't even

11:25.720 --> 11:26.960
really exist there?

11:26.960 --> 11:28.840
They've well moved on from that.

11:28.840 --> 11:31.640
They never even had it in the first place.

11:31.640 --> 11:36.320
It just seems like maybe the VCs have finally woken up to the fact that it's just not a

11:36.320 --> 11:38.400
very good idea.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.080
I think maybe you've honed in on the issue.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.800
You know, Michael Hulse had something interesting to me when I had him on Linux Unplugged to

11:43.800 --> 11:45.640
talk about Endless.

11:45.640 --> 11:51.960
And that was that the company had recently discovered that their offline bunch of information

11:51.960 --> 11:56.480
that you can get to without having to go on the internet, like say, all of Wikipedia and

11:56.480 --> 12:02.480
lots of things like that, was really useful in prisons, that prisons were interested in

12:02.480 --> 12:07.840
their hardware-software combo because they could give inmates access to information,

12:07.840 --> 12:11.840
but they wouldn't necessarily give them access to things that would, quote unquote, trigger

12:11.840 --> 12:14.760
them or influence them.

12:14.760 --> 12:17.080
And when he said that to me, it hit me like a wave.

12:17.080 --> 12:20.580
Like that must be, in the United States, a huge market.

12:20.580 --> 12:26.040
A company could get very rich super-serving that niche because it's a big industry here

12:26.040 --> 12:27.040
in the States.

12:27.040 --> 12:31.440
And so you have to wonder if perhaps maybe as Endless is becoming more and more aware

12:31.440 --> 12:37.800
to this, that the traditional community outreach and those aspects of the business are becoming

12:37.800 --> 12:43.820
de-emphasized and the business contacts and getting into those types of setups where there

12:43.820 --> 12:47.080
is considerable funding are perhaps being emphasized.

12:47.080 --> 12:51.640
That's total speculation on my part, but it does kind of jive with your total speculation,

12:51.640 --> 12:52.640
so I like it.

12:52.640 --> 12:53.640
Yeah.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.640
Well, that's the thing.

12:54.640 --> 12:59.000
Well, we've got a speculation because we haven't heard anything official from Endless at this

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
stage.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.880
They've not made a statement about it.

13:01.880 --> 13:05.040
And so what else is there to do but speculate?

13:05.040 --> 13:10.200
And this is a real shame because if you look at the technicalities of the project, it's

13:10.200 --> 13:12.360
actually really interesting, isn't it?

13:12.360 --> 13:16.880
Using an OS tree and a modified gnome and everything, it is a very interesting project,

13:16.880 --> 13:21.720
but I just don't think that it has its audience apart from this prisons thing, which I'd forgotten

13:21.720 --> 13:22.720
about.

13:22.720 --> 13:28.160
Yeah, maybe they can make that happen because there is quite a lot of money to be made there.

13:28.160 --> 13:34.840
So hopefully that's what they're doing, pivoting away from the developing world to US prisons

13:34.840 --> 13:37.280
and the rest of us can benefit as a result.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.920
You know, I don't make any promises because I'm on the road and connectivity and time

13:40.920 --> 13:44.980
are very limited, but I'm going to try to contact Endless and get a comment on the recent

13:44.980 --> 13:49.600
layoffs and our speculation in the show and see if they want to put anything on the record

13:49.600 --> 13:51.440
and we'll do an update if they do.

13:51.440 --> 13:55.040
But I'm betting for now it's going to be mum's the word.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.040
Yeah.

13:56.040 --> 14:01.520
Well, speaking of gnome, something that caught my eye this week was a story on Pharaonyx

14:01.520 --> 14:06.000
about something that came out of the Gnome 2018 Performance Hackfest.

14:06.000 --> 14:12.200
And that was a comment from Eric Anholt, who essentially said that Gnome 3 is just too

14:12.200 --> 14:17.120
heavy to run on a Raspberry Pi, despite the various improvements they've made with regards

14:17.120 --> 14:21.480
to the graphics stack and all the rest of that, it's just too fat.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.480
Right.

14:22.480 --> 14:27.340
And Eric is Broadcom's maintainer of the VC4 and V3D graphics driver stacks.

14:27.340 --> 14:31.880
So it's with some authority that he makes this comment.

14:31.880 --> 14:36.000
And when you read the quote, which will have a link in the show notes, linuxactionnews.com

14:36.000 --> 14:40.400
slash 56, it is not even partisan.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.320
It's just sort of this is the facts.

14:42.320 --> 14:47.400
He says, ultimately, I'm skeptical of Gnome 3 ever being usable on a Raspberry Pi.

14:47.400 --> 14:50.320
The clutter-based gnome shell painting is too slow.

14:50.320 --> 14:57.720
60% of a CPU is burned in the shell just trying to present a single 60 frames per second GLX

14:57.720 --> 14:58.720
gear.

14:58.720 --> 15:03.600
And there doesn't seem to be a plan for improving it other than maybe delete clutter someday.

15:03.600 --> 15:09.220
Also, the JavaScript extension system being in the compositor thread means that you drop

15:09.220 --> 15:13.660
application frames when something else happens in the system.

15:13.660 --> 15:17.060
Network state change, a notification, et cetera.

15:17.060 --> 15:19.320
This was a bad software architecture choice.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.480
And digging out of that hole is going to take a long time.

15:22.480 --> 15:28.320
I'm agnostic on whether it was wrong to move those into the same process as the compositor,

15:28.320 --> 15:31.000
but the same thread was definitely wrong.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.200
I'll keep working on the debugging tools to try to enable anyone to work on these problems,

15:35.200 --> 15:36.200
though.

15:36.200 --> 15:39.400
That's the folks at Purism.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.880
Yeah, there are two reasons that this caught my attention.

15:41.880 --> 15:46.960
One was obviously the Liebman 5, which Purism are working on, which is an ARM-based device,

15:46.960 --> 15:48.960
not a massively high-end one.

15:48.960 --> 15:53.740
But also, if you have been following the news about what Microsoft have been up to, they've

15:53.740 --> 15:57.760
been shipping these ARM-based Windows laptops now.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.920
And ARM is the future.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.200
It's the present.

16:01.200 --> 16:07.000
And x86, OK, that is still going to be around for professionals and developers.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.100
There's a lot of people who are going to use that, but consumer machines are moving over

16:12.100 --> 16:13.400
to ARM, I think.

16:13.400 --> 16:18.280
And GNOME just doesn't seem to be suitable for those types of machines.

16:18.280 --> 16:21.920
You know, I've been thinking about this, because we've been talking more and more about this.

16:21.920 --> 16:28.480
And I think what we're witnessing is the conflux of a huge expansion in the GNOME user base

16:28.480 --> 16:33.920
as 1804 and 1710 shipped, and the Ubuntu users moved over.

16:33.920 --> 16:38.680
And we're also seeing this quicker and quicker pace towards ARM, and getting more and more

16:38.680 --> 16:41.060
things to work on ARM systems.

16:41.060 --> 16:43.800
And that's also exposing a bunch of issues.

16:43.800 --> 16:46.600
And at the same time, we're moving to Wayland.

16:46.600 --> 16:50.180
And that's making us rethink a whole bunch of architecture stuff.

16:50.180 --> 16:55.340
And these things, these pressures, are all pushing against GNOME Shell at the same time

16:55.340 --> 16:56.340
right now.

16:56.340 --> 16:57.960
And something's got to give.

16:57.960 --> 17:04.080
And it's resulting in a lot of conversation about performance, drawbacks, and limitations

17:04.080 --> 17:05.420
of the design of GNOME.

17:05.420 --> 17:10.560
And I don't know where we go from here, because right now, it's a massive desktop that's shipping

17:10.560 --> 17:15.380
on pretty much every professional grade, quote, unquote, distro.

17:15.380 --> 17:16.640
You don't know where we go from here?

17:16.640 --> 17:21.320
Well, get my troll face on, plasma, surely, and cute, generally.

17:21.320 --> 17:26.560
Yeah, although it does seem like the upstream market, the curators of the desktop have made

17:26.560 --> 17:27.560
their decision.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.480
And that's what GNOME and GTK, it is.

17:29.480 --> 17:30.640
Thankfully, it's trivial.

17:30.640 --> 17:36.080
For those of us who care to make a change, like I'm running plasma everywhere now.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.080
Got family on it, too.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.560
I've just gone crazy with how great it is.

17:38.560 --> 17:39.940
I love it, love it, love it.

17:39.940 --> 17:43.480
And it was a big refuge after getting very frustrated with my GNOME desktop.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.180
I still think it's a great project.

17:45.180 --> 17:48.640
And I really hope they do pull it out, because they have some great designers.

17:48.640 --> 17:49.980
They have some great ideas.

17:49.980 --> 17:51.780
And they have a ton of market momentum.

17:51.780 --> 17:55.880
So just for the desktop to be successful, I hope they pull this thing out.

17:55.880 --> 18:01.640
But in the meantime, yeah, I'm living in plasma land.

18:01.640 --> 18:02.880
Last.ting.com.

18:02.880 --> 18:03.960
It's smarter than unlimited.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.520
When you use less, you pay less.

18:05.520 --> 18:08.440
And when you need more, you just pay for what you use.

18:08.440 --> 18:12.420
Your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes, whatever you use, that's what you pay for.

18:12.420 --> 18:13.840
It's $6 per line.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.500
You want one phone, $6 a month.

18:15.500 --> 18:18.040
You want two phones, guess what, $12 a month.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.040
It's really straightforward and simple.

18:20.040 --> 18:24.040
You know, I almost always have about a $40 a month Ting bill.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.560
And that's with several phones on my bill.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.180
That's because I'm always on Wi-Fi.

18:28.180 --> 18:30.220
And I don't like to make phone calls.

18:30.220 --> 18:33.320
But on these road trips, I end up using some Ting data.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.760
And it ends up being like $10 or $15 more that month.

18:36.760 --> 18:40.480
But man, does that wash out across the 11 months that I'm not doing that.

18:40.480 --> 18:44.560
And the thing about Ting is they have GSM and CDMA network.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.580
And I like to use the best tool for the job.

18:46.580 --> 18:52.560
And I came into the spot I'm parked in right now in Cortez, Colorado.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.360
And I thought, for sure, it's going to be the GSM.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.240
I'm going to go with the GSM signal.

18:56.240 --> 18:57.480
I jumped on there.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.840
And I had about a negative 110 dB.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.200
It wasn't very great.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.160
It was usable, though.

19:03.160 --> 19:06.320
About 110 millisecond ping to the Google servers.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.400
Not great for VoIP calls and doing shows.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.920
So I thought, you know what, I'll just give the CDMA network a try.

19:10.920 --> 19:11.720
I pop over.

19:11.720 --> 19:12.560
I have a Nexus 6P.

19:12.560 --> 19:16.720
So I pop over on my Nexus 6P on the CDMA network.

19:16.720 --> 19:20.960
Heck, if I'm not getting negative 80 dB right now, and I've got full bars,

19:20.960 --> 19:23.800
and Joe and I have been sitting here having this entire conversation

19:23.800 --> 19:28.920
over my Nexus 6P on the Ting CDMA network tethered to my laptop.

19:28.920 --> 19:34.520
And right now, I'm getting 50 milliseconds as I ping the Google DNS server.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.400
I love the flexibility of Ting.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.120
And as a small business owner who's on the road,

19:38.120 --> 19:39.640
I would never go with anything else.

19:39.640 --> 19:43.560
Having that choice between GSM and CDMA means the difference between us

19:43.560 --> 19:46.400
having a smooth conversation or having a choppy show.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.520
And that makes all the difference.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.520
Check it out, lass.ting.com.

19:50.520 --> 19:57.320
Let's talk about Huawei and them locking down their bootloaders.

19:57.320 --> 20:02.360
Traditionally, Huawei have been pretty good with having their phones be unlockable,

20:02.360 --> 20:05.360
and then you can flash all sorts of custom ROMs on them.

20:05.360 --> 20:07.000
And they've always been fairly affordable as well.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.880
So they've been quite popular among people who want to run things like LineageOS,

20:11.880 --> 20:15.000
but don't necessarily want a flagship.

20:15.000 --> 20:19.400
Well, that has all changed now because they've decided to not give people the codes

20:19.400 --> 20:21.680
to unlock their bootloaders anymore.

20:21.680 --> 20:25.560
And if you've got an existing device, then you've got under two months,

20:25.560 --> 20:28.880
I think, at this stage to get one, and then they'll just cut you off

20:28.880 --> 20:30.840
and any new devices won't get one.

20:30.840 --> 20:36.720
So official advice if you want to run custom ROMs is don't buy a Huawei.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.720
This seems like a really strange about face

20:38.720 --> 20:43.040
because Huawei was considered one of the go-to brands for ROM flashing.

20:43.040 --> 20:48.560
In fact, for years, they had forums open where people were discussing this.

20:48.560 --> 20:51.280
They made it fairly easy to get the bootloader information

20:51.280 --> 20:52.600
for each of the device.

20:52.600 --> 20:56.840
They even had support pages that would go through the process of how to unlock.

20:56.840 --> 21:00.320
And then things like about a month ago started to change.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.520
The pages went away, and then you could email support,

21:03.520 --> 21:07.600
and they would reply with some steps and maybe the unlock code that you needed.

21:07.600 --> 21:11.160
And then that stopped, and then we have this official policy.

21:11.160 --> 21:16.200
Anything sold after May 25, 2018, this is going to be the new policy going forward.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.200
And I don't know what to make of this other than they

21:18.200 --> 21:19.560
must have gotten burned somehow.

21:19.560 --> 21:22.680
The support costs must have been too high, and they're making changes.

21:22.680 --> 21:26.760
Or they were pressured into making a change.

21:26.760 --> 21:29.120
I'd be curious to know what the audience's speculation is too.

21:29.120 --> 21:31.680
What, are you speculating Google might have done this to them?

21:31.680 --> 21:32.520
I don't know.

21:32.520 --> 21:36.400
You've got this new update process that was announced at Google I.O.

21:36.400 --> 21:37.480
That sounds pretty great.

21:37.480 --> 21:41.480
We just talked about it, and there's some new requirements to sign.

21:41.480 --> 21:45.640
Maybe there's some, I don't know, I'm just speculating.

21:45.640 --> 21:49.880
But maybe there's some suggestions from Google to really secure the device

21:49.880 --> 21:51.760
and make sure these updates are the right ones

21:51.760 --> 21:54.720
and that people aren't getting malicious ROMs or something like that.

21:54.720 --> 21:55.920
You have to make these steps.

21:55.920 --> 22:00.080
And they could make a good case, and the larger consumer market

22:00.080 --> 22:01.960
doesn't really care about this.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.280
So that makes it a low risk change for them to make.

22:04.280 --> 22:04.720
I don't know.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.120
I don't like all the speculation.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.480
I could be totally off base.

22:07.480 --> 22:11.280
But something seems off here because it's a big change from dedicated support

22:11.280 --> 22:16.080
pages on how to unlock devices to no more unlocked devices going forward,

22:16.080 --> 22:17.120
hard stop.

22:17.120 --> 22:19.200
Well, I think you hit the nail on the head in there

22:19.200 --> 22:21.960
by saying that almost nobody cares about this.

22:21.960 --> 22:25.480
I think the kind of people who are listening to this show probably do.

22:25.480 --> 22:29.160
But the general public can't even conceive

22:29.160 --> 22:33.000
of the idea of putting a different operating system or ROM on their phone.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.880
They don't even know what that means.

22:35.880 --> 22:39.920
And so the vast majority of people who would buy a cheap Huawei phone,

22:39.920 --> 22:44.000
or even a high end one, they're just buying it to use as a phone.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.160
And it's always seemed strange to me when people do that.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.400
They buy a phone and just don't look whether it's

22:49.400 --> 22:51.840
supported by lineage first before buying it and stuff.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.400
But that's just what normal people do.

22:54.400 --> 22:58.680
And so I don't think that they're going to lose any customers over there,

22:58.680 --> 23:00.200
so very few customers.

23:00.200 --> 23:02.840
And they obviously just don't value those customers.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.600
See, that's where I think their mistake is.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.920
That's a very valuable customer base because where do you

23:07.920 --> 23:10.440
get any new ideas other than watching what

23:10.440 --> 23:12.360
the fringe of your users are doing?

23:12.360 --> 23:13.800
Watch the fringe user base.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.640
See how they're pushing their devices.

23:15.640 --> 23:18.160
See what crazy things they're adding to their custom ROMs

23:18.160 --> 23:19.560
to make their devices better.

23:19.560 --> 23:24.000
And then you, as an OEM, can sit back and watch that and cherry pick

23:24.000 --> 23:25.320
the best ideas.

23:25.320 --> 23:27.960
And then you integrate that into your product offerings

23:27.960 --> 23:30.000
that you sell to all the mainstream consumers.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.080
And boom, all of a sudden, you offer something

23:32.080 --> 23:35.360
that's truly different than the rest of all of the other Android

23:35.360 --> 23:37.080
handsets on the market.

23:37.080 --> 23:41.040
And I don't know how you get there without supporting ROM communities.

23:41.040 --> 23:44.480
I grant you, there's a support cost to supporting the ROM community

23:44.480 --> 23:45.960
and making sure that stuff works.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.920
And when their devices break and they try to make warranty claims,

23:48.920 --> 23:50.200
there are costs there.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.320
And perhaps they're great.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.080
I don't know.

23:52.080 --> 23:55.120
I doubt it if it's a small community to begin with.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.000
It seems like the insights you get from them,

23:57.000 --> 23:58.920
watching the things they do with their devices,

23:58.920 --> 24:00.440
outweigh that support cost.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.280
But what do I know?

24:01.280 --> 24:02.280
I don't make phones.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.800
Well, let me counter that by saying, first of all,

24:04.800 --> 24:07.760
you don't have to be looking at the custom ROMs on your own phones

24:07.760 --> 24:09.160
to see the innovation.

24:09.160 --> 24:11.880
You could just buy a couple of pixels or whatever

24:11.880 --> 24:16.160
and flash the latest ROMs and see what the community is doing

24:16.160 --> 24:18.400
on other people's hardware.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.840
And also, in terms of them being valuable customers, well,

24:20.840 --> 24:21.440
not really.

24:21.440 --> 24:23.840
Because the kind of person who's going to flash custom ROMs

24:23.840 --> 24:26.600
on their phone are the kind of person who is not just

24:26.600 --> 24:28.160
going to buy a new one all the time.

24:28.160 --> 24:31.360
They're going to try and extend the life of it with custom ROMs.

24:31.360 --> 24:33.480
So really, it makes sense that they

24:33.480 --> 24:35.880
don't care about that portion of the market, I think.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.520
Well, then we're all just going to have pixels.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.840
See, somebody has to support these communities.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.680
And somebody has to be the one watching them

24:41.680 --> 24:44.640
to put those features forward.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.760
So if they don't do it, somebody else will.

24:46.760 --> 24:47.960
That's their loss.

24:47.960 --> 24:50.920
And if what you say is true, then it

24:50.920 --> 24:54.640
sounds like the lifespan of custom ROMs is limited anyways.

24:54.640 --> 24:57.240
And they're just making the right move.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.240
That's depressing, and I don't like it.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.960
Well, speaking of depressing, Samsung

25:01.960 --> 25:04.880
won a court case in the Netherlands.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.280
And so now they're not going to be

25:06.280 --> 25:08.960
forced to update their old phones for four years.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.200
Isn't this something a consumer group

25:11.200 --> 25:14.400
went after Samsung for not distributing updates

25:14.400 --> 25:15.560
in a timely manner?

25:15.560 --> 25:18.520
And their basic argument was Samsung

25:18.520 --> 25:20.480
should be like a car manufacturer.

25:20.480 --> 25:23.680
And if a car manufacturer is making so many models of cars

25:23.680 --> 25:25.640
that they can't produce them safely,

25:25.640 --> 25:28.960
then they should stop and produce fewer models

25:28.960 --> 25:31.840
and variations of cars until they narrow the scope

25:31.840 --> 25:34.000
to something that they can support properly.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
I thought that was an interesting argument.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.400
They took that to the court.

25:37.400 --> 25:42.120
And the judge said, thank you, but no thank you.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.200
The court ruled in Samsung's favor

25:44.200 --> 25:46.960
and said that the claims that were made by that consumer

25:46.960 --> 25:51.000
group were inadmissible because they related to future acts

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
that Samsung may or may not make.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.800
And we have no idea what the future holds.

25:56.800 --> 26:00.120
So the judge said, go along, no thank you.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.560
A very spurious argument, I think.

26:02.560 --> 26:05.760
And it makes you wonder who had the better lawyers here.

26:05.760 --> 26:07.680
You would imagine Samsung, obviously,

26:07.680 --> 26:09.360
with all the money they've got.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.720
I think Samsung's lawyers have better lawyers

26:11.720 --> 26:13.720
than the consumer group's lawyers.

26:13.720 --> 26:16.200
Probably.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.520
But it's just a bad state of affairs, isn't it?

26:18.520 --> 26:21.760
That loads of these manufacturers

26:21.760 --> 26:23.560
sell these phones that never get updates.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.400
And we seem to bang on about it all the time.

26:25.400 --> 26:28.960
But this jumped out at me as a potential opportunity

26:28.960 --> 26:31.720
to say to them, no, you can't get away with this.

26:31.720 --> 26:35.680
You have to supply security updates at the minimum.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.400
And they're just not interested in doing it.

26:38.400 --> 26:43.840
And it seems that maybe the courts, in this case,

26:43.840 --> 26:45.480
didn't understand the implications

26:45.480 --> 26:47.000
of what they were talking about.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.000
And maybe it was a bit beyond them.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.440
Because I just don't see how they lost, really,

26:53.440 --> 26:56.600
apart from that having the more expensive lawyers situation.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.360
Well, see, Samsung sees it the other way.

26:58.360 --> 27:01.320
They told the BBC that they were satisfied with that ruling

27:01.320 --> 27:02.600
and that the judge has acknowledged

27:02.600 --> 27:04.560
that Samsung is doing more than enough to ensure

27:04.560 --> 27:06.480
safety of its products.

27:06.480 --> 27:07.600
Stop right there, though.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.160
It's interesting that this is starting

27:09.160 --> 27:11.480
to be discussed more and more as a safety issue.

27:11.480 --> 27:13.200
I think this should be looked at the way

27:13.200 --> 27:15.740
you can have flaws in consumer electronics,

27:15.740 --> 27:17.960
like a toaster that could catch your house on fire.

27:17.960 --> 27:20.120
You can have flaws in your phone that

27:20.120 --> 27:23.520
can expose your private information or your nudie pics.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.880
And further, in that statement they released to the BBC,

27:25.880 --> 27:28.640
they say, quote, it's a pity that the court route taken

27:28.640 --> 27:32.320
by the consumer group has unjustly cast our update

27:32.320 --> 27:34.520
policy in a negative light.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.780
And the ruling shows that we take

27:36.780 --> 27:39.280
the security of our smartphones we provide

27:39.280 --> 27:42.000
to consumers very seriously.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
So you see, Joe, Samsung says you're wrong.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Yeah, I suppose I am wrong here.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.440
And something we were definitely wrong about last week

27:48.440 --> 27:50.840
is essential, they are not shutting down,

27:50.840 --> 27:53.600
according to Andy Rubin's leaked email.

27:53.600 --> 27:56.520
Yeah, definitely, definitely not shutting down.

27:56.520 --> 27:57.960
I hope this is true.

27:57.960 --> 28:01.800
I do know one rule about business financing,

28:01.800 --> 28:06.600
and you can see lots of other business financing tip

28:06.600 --> 28:09.560
experts sharing this information freely online.

28:09.560 --> 28:11.360
You never say you're selling.

28:11.360 --> 28:12.760
You never say that.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.840
You can say you're raising funds.

28:14.840 --> 28:16.320
You can say you're going to get a loan.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.840
But you never say you're selling,

28:17.840 --> 28:20.440
because then your value plummets,

28:20.440 --> 28:22.920
and you're not going to get anything for the sale.

28:22.920 --> 28:26.880
So the strategy, especially with Silicon Valley-type companies,

28:26.880 --> 28:29.240
is to be fundraising.

28:29.240 --> 28:32.280
And while you're fundraising, you might also then just

28:32.280 --> 28:34.680
slip into sales discussions.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.360
And you can see lots of people talking about this online,

28:37.360 --> 28:38.920
so it's not really clear.

28:38.920 --> 28:41.200
Because I saw that email that came out.

28:41.200 --> 28:43.320
What Andy Rubin said in there was essentially,

28:43.320 --> 28:45.360
we're not closing, but we are reconsidering

28:45.360 --> 28:47.040
the entire product lineup, and we're

28:47.040 --> 28:50.440
going to try to get a big fatty loan from the bank.

28:50.440 --> 28:53.360
That could be, industry speak for,

28:53.360 --> 28:54.920
all options are on the table.

28:54.920 --> 28:56.260
Well, I hope that that's right.

28:56.260 --> 28:58.040
I hope that all options are there,

28:58.040 --> 29:01.240
including that they'll get some more financing

29:01.240 --> 29:02.400
and make some more phones.

29:02.400 --> 29:04.880
Because from everything I've heard about the Essential

29:04.880 --> 29:07.320
Phone, it is pretty good.

29:07.320 --> 29:10.560
And it is very developer-friendly,

29:10.560 --> 29:12.800
and the complete opposite of Samsung

29:12.800 --> 29:14.380
in terms of the security updates.

29:14.380 --> 29:16.840
They're a model citizen, so it would be a real shame

29:16.840 --> 29:18.080
if they were to go away.

29:18.080 --> 29:19.960
Yeah, we did get some notes from some listeners

29:19.960 --> 29:22.680
that have the Essential Phone, and they sold me on it.

29:22.680 --> 29:23.880
I want one now.

29:23.880 --> 29:25.840
So I hope they do keep making them,

29:25.840 --> 29:28.000
because it sounded like a really good phone.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.800
And like you said, too, they're the opposite

29:29.800 --> 29:32.080
of what we just talked about with Samsung and Huawei.

29:32.080 --> 29:35.120
They're very developer-friendly and community-friendly,

29:35.120 --> 29:36.540
which you really have to appreciate,

29:36.540 --> 29:37.740
especially from where we sit.

29:37.740 --> 29:39.520
So hopefully, things are looking up.

29:39.520 --> 29:41.400
Let us know what you think about anything we've

29:41.400 --> 29:44.040
talked about today, including your take on any of the stories

29:44.040 --> 29:46.800
at linuxactionnews.com slash contact.

29:46.800 --> 29:49.200
And you mentioned that you're on the road, the road to Texas

29:49.200 --> 29:50.160
Linux Fest.

29:50.160 --> 29:52.000
Yeah, right now I'm just in the Four Corners

29:52.000 --> 29:53.240
area of the United States.

29:53.240 --> 29:56.160
But June 8 through the 9th, I'll be in the Austin area

29:56.160 --> 29:57.280
at Texas Linux Fest.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.840
We do have a telegram group set up.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.520
If you want to join us, maybe grab some barbecue or just

30:01.520 --> 30:04.680
hang out, jupitabroadcasting.com slash Texas.

30:04.680 --> 30:06.320
And if you want to track where I'm at,

30:06.320 --> 30:09.080
maybe meet up in the route there or on the way back,

30:09.080 --> 30:10.800
jupitabroadcasting.com slash Rover,

30:10.800 --> 30:14.900
where I have an embedded tracker for you and the NSA.

30:14.900 --> 30:18.320
Which is how I knew you were near the Four Corners monument.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.360
And the best way to get episodes every single week

30:20.360 --> 30:23.240
is to go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.880
And please consider supporting the entire network and all

30:25.880 --> 30:29.400
the things we do at patreon.com slash jupitersignal.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.280
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take

30:31.280 --> 30:33.320
on the latest Linux on open source news.

30:33.320 --> 30:34.960
I'm at chrislas.

30:34.960 --> 30:36.400
I'm at Joe Rissington.

30:36.400 --> 30:39.240
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week.

30:39.240 --> 30:40.040
See you later.

30:40.040 --> 30:48.600
I'm at Joe Rissington, and we'll see you next week.
