00:00.000 --> 00:09.520
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 120, recorded on August 25th, 2019.

00:09.520 --> 00:10.520
I'm Chris.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.520
And I'm Joe.

00:11.520 --> 00:12.520
Hello, Joe.

00:12.520 --> 00:15.600
Good to be connected with you, and a big happy birthday to Linux.

00:15.600 --> 00:22.740
Today, on the day as we record, Linus announced Linux on the mailing list 28 years ago.

00:22.740 --> 00:25.120
The comp.os.minix mailing list.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.720
Yeah, it's not quite 30, but it's getting there, eh?

00:27.720 --> 00:28.920
Any excuse to celebrate, Joe?

00:28.920 --> 00:31.980
I can't imagine when 30 lands, it's going to be an internet party.

00:31.980 --> 00:37.400
But we start the news out this week from System76, who has announced a new firmware updater.

00:37.400 --> 00:40.620
Yeah, they're calling this Firmware Manager.

00:40.620 --> 00:47.640
And it's really a front end for their System76-Firmware command line tool at the moment.

00:47.640 --> 00:51.320
But it is also going to work with FWAPD, or whatever you call it.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.240
We need a standard name for the firmware update tool.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.020
Yeah, we really do.

00:56.020 --> 00:59.080
So obviously, Gnome Software and Discover already do this.

00:59.080 --> 01:01.680
And this is a tool that's really being built for Pop!

01:01.680 --> 01:05.120
OS and for Debian distributions right now.

01:05.120 --> 01:08.360
Could be others in the future, if somebody wants to repackage it.

01:08.360 --> 01:14.040
So this is like somebody like yourself, really, Joe, who's on Ubuntu and XFCE, or like myself,

01:14.040 --> 01:15.040
who's on Ubuntu and XFCE.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.440
And I don't use Gnome Software very regularly.

01:17.440 --> 01:21.520
In fact, I just recently spent a weekend on Wayland and Gnome Shell, and I opened up Gnome

01:21.520 --> 01:22.520
Software.

01:22.520 --> 01:26.360
And they had three firmware updates that I just kind of forgotten about, because nothing

01:26.360 --> 01:29.000
really surfaced them for me.

01:29.000 --> 01:36.040
And like you, if I do want a GUI, I'm going to launch Synaptic.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.680
I'm not launching Gnome Software on XFCE.

01:38.680 --> 01:40.080
So I might actually use this.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.080
Yeah, same.

01:41.080 --> 01:44.400
It's something that I will certainly look into using, because I haven't updated the

01:44.400 --> 01:48.500
firmware on any of my machines for, well, since I got them, pretty much, because I don't

01:48.500 --> 01:50.400
use Gnome Software.

01:50.400 --> 01:54.680
So yeah, I'm looking forward to it appearing in the repos, possibly as a snap package.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.960
Love to see.

01:55.960 --> 01:59.280
Obviously, this is for Pop OS users primarily.

01:59.280 --> 02:03.560
But I did have a chat with System76's CEO, Carl, about this.

02:03.560 --> 02:07.600
And I asked him, are you turning into a software shop?

02:07.600 --> 02:08.800
And the answer is sort of.

02:08.800 --> 02:13.160
They're building for Pop OS customers first, but they intend to architect things in a way

02:13.160 --> 02:16.360
that make it usable by pretty much anyone in open source.

02:16.360 --> 02:18.440
They're not trying to limit anybody's use of this.

02:18.440 --> 02:20.240
It's built in Rust.

02:20.240 --> 02:25.800
Both the System76 components that are just for their firmware and the LVFS components

02:25.800 --> 02:26.800
are modules.

02:26.800 --> 02:32.040
You could build it on a system and have no System76 firmware support at all if you wanted

02:32.040 --> 02:34.520
to, or vice versa.

02:34.520 --> 02:38.200
And they've done it in a way where you could even write a Qt front end for this thing and

02:38.200 --> 02:42.200
submit it upstream to the project and have a Qt version that's not GTK based.

02:42.200 --> 02:46.560
I like what they're doing here, because they're solving needs for their situation, but they're

02:46.560 --> 02:48.920
doing it in a way that's above and beyond expectations.

02:48.920 --> 02:55.760
Yeah, and it's no secret that the hardware OEMs that System76 use are used by other Linux

02:55.760 --> 02:56.800
computer vendors.

02:56.800 --> 03:00.960
So we could potentially see some benefit for those customers as well.

03:00.960 --> 03:05.720
Now from a user standpoint, what they've really created here is essentially a GTK widget library

03:05.720 --> 03:09.240
that pops into GNOME settings.

03:09.240 --> 03:15.080
So on Pop OS or a different distribution and even theoretically XFCE desktop in the control

03:15.080 --> 03:20.120
panel system settings area, you could have a GTK widget library that pops it open and

03:20.120 --> 03:24.920
there's the firmware manager, no dependencies on any other software orchestration.

03:24.920 --> 03:25.920
That's really nice.

03:25.920 --> 03:27.280
And I really like the open nature of this.

03:27.280 --> 03:32.320
They're putting up on GitHub, they're blogging about the process, and they're openly supporting

03:32.320 --> 03:33.320
other front ends.

03:33.320 --> 03:36.360
They've built this in a way where it can be GUI agnostic.

03:36.360 --> 03:40.880
The core library doesn't depend on GTK.

03:40.880 --> 03:44.700
That's super appealing because it could be used wider in the open source ecosystem because

03:44.700 --> 03:45.700
of that.

03:45.700 --> 03:49.960
Like those small decisions they've made that really all kind of aggregate into something

03:49.960 --> 03:52.440
that's very usable by the rest of the community.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.560
Again, I'm really impressed.

03:55.560 --> 04:02.400
I was skeptical and vocal about that skepticism when System76 didn't just go all in with LVFS

04:02.400 --> 04:06.280
like we've seen Lenovo and Dell do recently.

04:06.280 --> 04:10.200
But this seems to be a pretty proper response to the sticky situation they find themselves

04:10.200 --> 04:12.120
in and helps everybody out.

04:12.120 --> 04:15.920
Well, it's much like with Pop OS, we were quite skeptical when that came out and thought,

04:15.920 --> 04:18.560
well, why don't you just use Ubuntu?

04:18.560 --> 04:24.520
And they've kind of proved us wrong to an extent in that they have added value to Ubuntu

04:24.520 --> 04:27.080
and differentiated themselves there.

04:27.080 --> 04:32.440
And so sometimes it is worth letting things shake out and seeing what people's long-term

04:32.440 --> 04:38.540
plan is, companies' long-term plan, because sometimes what might seem immediately obvious

04:38.540 --> 04:42.840
isn't necessarily obvious when you come a few months or years down the line.

04:42.840 --> 04:47.120
And the other lesson here is a lot of open source stuff is done out in the open.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.540
It's put out there early so that way it can evolve and mature.

04:50.540 --> 04:55.120
And that is often a time where things are not fully formed.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.400
They're not done yet.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.560
I'm also coming around to Pop OS.

04:58.560 --> 05:03.460
It seems to have caught the attention of popular YouTubers like Linus Tech Tips.

05:03.460 --> 05:07.420
Clearly seems to be driving value that users are finding attractive.

05:07.420 --> 05:11.560
And I think there's probably still more they could do to make it an even more valuable

05:11.560 --> 05:12.560
differentiation.

05:12.560 --> 05:16.720
I don't think it's quite there yet, but it's clear they're going in a direction that is

05:16.720 --> 05:17.840
obvious now.

05:17.840 --> 05:18.840
And that's nice to see.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.600
I think there's lessons to take from this.

05:20.600 --> 05:27.440
And I hope to see some adoption for this tool to benefit all kinds of other desktops and,

05:27.440 --> 05:29.840
most importantly, other distributions too.

05:29.840 --> 05:34.640
Well, I've seen quite a lot of skepticism this week about our next story, and that is

05:34.640 --> 05:39.360
the OpenPower Foundation aligning with the Linux Foundation and releasing the instruction

05:39.360 --> 05:41.840
set architecture for OpenPower.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.720
Yeah, this is a lot.

05:43.720 --> 05:48.760
And this is a big response to the progress we're seeing on RISC-V and the pressure from

05:48.760 --> 05:50.200
ARM processors.

05:50.200 --> 05:56.120
So to be clear, BigBlue is moving the OpenPower Foundation, which it formed with Google, Mellanox,

05:56.120 --> 05:58.460
Technologies, NVIDIA, and others.

05:58.460 --> 06:01.740
This is an established pretty big group.

06:01.740 --> 06:08.040
And they're moving that under administrative control of the Linux Foundation, which is

06:08.040 --> 06:10.040
a pretty big feather in the Linux Foundation's cap.

06:10.040 --> 06:15.680
And they've got so many foundations now, it's feeling more like the Foundation Foundation,

06:15.680 --> 06:16.680
not so much like the Linux.

06:16.680 --> 06:17.680
Foundations for days.

06:17.680 --> 06:18.680
Yeah.

06:18.680 --> 06:19.680
Yeah.

06:19.680 --> 06:23.520
But to your comment, Joe, about skepticism, you're right.

06:23.520 --> 06:27.480
The top comment on LWN is yawn.

06:27.480 --> 06:30.640
Hacker News is like, top comment's 10 years too late.

06:30.640 --> 06:35.320
And people are losing the perspective on this story, sort of like we lost a little perspective

06:35.320 --> 06:36.320
on the Pop!

06:36.320 --> 06:37.320
OS story early on.

06:37.320 --> 06:41.800
And the lessons that we just talked about for that apply to this story as well.

06:41.800 --> 06:48.640
This process is something that really began back in 1991.

06:48.640 --> 06:50.720
That's how big picture this is.

06:50.720 --> 06:58.340
They're moving pieces that have been shuffled around since Macintosh has had Motorola processors

06:58.340 --> 06:59.340
in them.

06:59.340 --> 07:03.400
So it's a continuous evolution of that effort.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.000
And it had some rough years.

07:05.000 --> 07:12.240
And now, with workloads like AI and RISC-V coming in with an open architecture that's

07:12.240 --> 07:18.920
being really kind of rapidly adopted in the marketplace, I think, in my opinion, that

07:18.920 --> 07:22.920
Open Power Foundation was looking at all of these trends and going, we're missing out.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.200
We got to do something.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.720
So hang on, are you telling me this story's been developing since before some of our listeners

07:27.720 --> 07:28.720
were even born?

07:28.720 --> 07:29.720
Yeah.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.440
That's the really kind of crazy thing about this.

07:31.440 --> 07:34.560
And that's why it seems like, oh, it's too late.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.960
It's just beginning, my friends.

07:35.960 --> 07:36.960
It really is.

07:36.960 --> 07:41.320
Because what they're doing here is they're essentially just really liberally licensing

07:41.320 --> 07:43.520
their open power platform.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.480
It's not full open source, giving away all the things.

07:46.480 --> 07:50.680
But it is, once you make a deal with them, once you call up the IBM suits and make a

07:50.680 --> 07:56.880
deal, you get everything you essentially need, including some extra bits that aren't part

07:56.880 --> 07:59.220
of the core PowerPC architecture.

07:59.220 --> 08:02.160
It feels like a response to RISC-V, really.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.600
But it's been done in a different way.

08:03.600 --> 08:08.700
I could not really work out exactly what they've opened up here.

08:08.700 --> 08:16.240
Because they have opened up the ISA, but it's not completely clear to me exactly how they're

08:16.240 --> 08:21.400
licensing that and to what extent you need to be a member of this foundation.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.920
And so there's a bit of a difference there with RISC-V. It's very clear.

08:24.920 --> 08:27.240
It's completely open under a permissive license.

08:27.240 --> 08:30.080
You can take it and make it proprietary.

08:30.080 --> 08:34.840
Whereas with open power, there seems to be a little bit of confusion there.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.320
We did research into this, and it's just not yet defined.

08:37.320 --> 08:41.840
In fact, also something else that's pretty critical is their memory interface hasn't

08:41.840 --> 08:44.320
been fully explained how that's going to be licensed yet either.

08:44.320 --> 08:47.840
It's just, quote, coming out sometime this year, end quote.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.460
Well, that didn't tell us anything.

08:50.460 --> 08:52.800
So there's more to happen here.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.520
And it really is night and day difference.

08:56.520 --> 09:03.120
The RISC-V platform is much more traditionally open source, and this is just liberally licensed.

09:03.120 --> 09:08.600
But I would say IBM's counterargument from the reading I've done is simply the ecosystem.

09:08.600 --> 09:13.920
Yeah, sure, RISC-V might be a more traditional open source model, but we're liberally licensing

09:13.920 --> 09:17.000
the Power9 platform, the PowerPC platform.

09:17.000 --> 09:23.480
This open power platform has an ecosystem with these open power processors in workstations.

09:23.480 --> 09:29.480
And Power9 processors fill the racks of the world's fastest supercomputers.

09:29.480 --> 09:34.560
That's an obvious ecosystem that has robust software written for it, Joe.

09:34.560 --> 09:42.300
And that would be their counterargument to that new, immature, risky five platform.

09:42.300 --> 09:47.480
But it does feel like an old world company's approach to things.

09:47.480 --> 09:53.880
If you contrast it with RISC-V and how that feels more agile somehow, this, it does feel

09:53.880 --> 09:59.920
like it's a kind of lumbering piece of an old company trying to stay down with the kids

09:59.920 --> 10:00.920
somehow.

10:00.920 --> 10:06.960
Yeah, when it comes to that licensing model, they've tried to bolt on a modern governance

10:06.960 --> 10:08.900
model though, which is kind of interesting.

10:08.900 --> 10:13.020
It's part that the Linux Foundation will be managing.

10:13.020 --> 10:19.400
This open governance model will have IBM on that board with other foundation members,

10:19.400 --> 10:24.160
and IBM gets precisely one vote, same as all of the other foundation members, as to what

10:24.160 --> 10:28.040
changes could be made to the Power ISA in the future.

10:28.040 --> 10:33.240
Now, IBM could, in theory, still make their own changes and ship it, but anything that's

10:33.240 --> 10:36.520
going to become the new standard has to be voted on by all members.

10:36.520 --> 10:41.640
So they're bolting on this weird, kind of more modern open governance model.

10:41.640 --> 10:46.060
I mean, it's weird in the sense that it's not normally paired with a licensing model

10:46.060 --> 10:48.480
like this that's not fully clear.

10:48.480 --> 10:53.680
But it's more modern than old business, but it still does definitely have that smell.

10:53.680 --> 10:59.880
Yeah, and I think that a lot of people, including me, jump straight for this RISC-V comparison.

10:59.880 --> 11:03.820
I think that potentially we're looking at very different markets here.

11:03.820 --> 11:05.880
That's I think the real truth of it.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.260
Pretty much so.

11:07.260 --> 11:12.360
I think whereas RISC-V is obviously more targeted at the embedded, which PowerPC does have some

11:12.360 --> 11:15.200
plays there, this is more high end.

11:15.200 --> 11:22.740
A big focus is extremely high bandwidth interconnections, reducing just the complication in communicating

11:22.740 --> 11:25.400
with the devices so that can be even faster.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.360
Coming up with maybe a replacement to PCI.

11:28.360 --> 11:34.200
All those kinds of things are in the scope of this foundation and all focused on absolute

11:34.200 --> 11:35.200
performance.

11:35.200 --> 11:39.480
But I just think RISC-V is more focused at the embedded market.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.880
You're not seeing RISC-V in a supercomputer anytime soon.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.800
Well, not just yet, but maybe one day.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.800
Wouldn't that be something?

11:46.800 --> 11:51.040
Could you imagine we're doing Linux Action News 800 and we're talking about how all of

11:51.040 --> 11:55.280
the top supercomputers are RISC based and then you'd like have a whole I told you so moment

11:55.280 --> 11:56.280
here on the show.

11:56.280 --> 12:00.920
Well, it's not the only thing the Linux Foundation have been up to this week.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.360
It's the summer of foundations, Joe.

12:03.360 --> 12:04.360
This is it.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.840
The Linux Foundation has really grown this year.

12:07.840 --> 12:13.320
And now they've launched the Confidential Computing Consortium, which is part of the

12:13.320 --> 12:14.320
Linux Foundation.

12:14.320 --> 12:19.900
Yeah, and they're pitching this as a community focused on projects, securing data in use.

12:19.900 --> 12:24.240
And they talk about in the announcement how at the moment, we've pretty much got data

12:24.240 --> 12:29.560
that is at rest in storage and the encryption of that all sorted out and you know, the security

12:29.560 --> 12:34.700
of that and data in transit over the network, that's pretty much sorted.

12:34.700 --> 12:41.120
But data that is in use, that's in memory and in the processor, that is something that

12:41.120 --> 12:42.560
we haven't quite nailed.

12:42.560 --> 12:46.120
And that's what this consortium is supposed to be about, right?

12:46.120 --> 12:53.160
Or even database tables, ultimately, they're like measure of success would be if two third

12:53.160 --> 12:58.940
party businesses that do not trust each other, were able to exchange information and have

12:58.940 --> 13:04.120
high confidence in the validity of that information, as so much so that they could conduct a business

13:04.120 --> 13:07.560
transaction or some other transaction of trust.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.720
That would be their benchmark here.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.240
And that is a good goal.

13:12.240 --> 13:17.620
They say current approaches really just don't solve that particular problem.

13:17.620 --> 13:21.080
You can tell it's a different time of year though, Joe, because if we were covering this

13:21.080 --> 13:26.080
story at this exact time last year, I feel like every five paragraphs would have the

13:26.080 --> 13:27.960
word blockchain in it.

13:27.960 --> 13:32.560
Yeah, or there'd be more about Spectre and Meltdown because that was the first thing

13:32.560 --> 13:37.600
I thought about was the whole attack factor there is data that's in use and in memory

13:37.600 --> 13:39.240
and in the CPU.

13:39.240 --> 13:44.160
And so this feels like a potentially quite late backlash to that.

13:44.160 --> 13:48.520
You could be right, Joe, because if you look at who's involved at this, it's like all the

13:48.520 --> 13:56.560
big names in the Linux Foundation, Alibaba Cloud, the ARM consortium, Google, IBM, Microsoft,

13:56.560 --> 13:58.880
Swiss Telecom, Intel.

13:58.880 --> 14:02.360
It's like the Linux Foundation was sitting around, you know, they're all having cocktails

14:02.360 --> 14:06.260
and they're saying, what could we do here that all of these different companies bring

14:06.260 --> 14:07.260
to the table?

14:07.260 --> 14:08.260
What could we pull together?

14:08.260 --> 14:14.280
So like, well, let's go get that trusted hardware platform research that Microsoft did and let's

14:14.280 --> 14:18.000
go get Intel Secure Enclave information and we'll pull that in.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.720
And let's go talk to IBM about that work they're doing on that encryption system and we'll

14:21.720 --> 14:22.720
bring that.

14:22.720 --> 14:28.840
They went to all of their big players and said, we're holding a security buffet.

14:28.840 --> 14:29.840
What can you bring to the party?

14:29.840 --> 14:33.840
And then they're putting it all under this label, this like one brand.

14:33.840 --> 14:37.240
It's very businessy, Joe, but at the same time, like, what's it going to take to get

14:37.240 --> 14:38.280
our data secured?

14:38.280 --> 14:39.280
What's it going to take, Joe?

14:39.280 --> 14:43.080
Yeah, when money's involved, people suddenly start taking an interest.

14:43.080 --> 14:47.240
And something that people should probably take more of an interest in is supply chain

14:47.240 --> 14:48.240
attacks.

14:48.240 --> 14:54.360
I never really considered these supply chain attacks, but when you consider that malware

14:54.360 --> 14:58.680
authors and attackers are going after the source of open source applications that users

14:58.680 --> 15:01.660
get it from, all right, it makes sense.

15:01.660 --> 15:04.760
The article here from Dan Gooden over at Ars Technica, we'll have a link in the show notes,

15:04.760 --> 15:10.980
and he makes a pretty good argument, essentially running down a history of the most recent

15:10.980 --> 15:15.960
dozen attacks, starting off with probably the most well known one currently, which is

15:15.960 --> 15:19.240
the backdoor that was in Webman that's recently come to light.

15:19.240 --> 15:23.880
And then he quickly points out that there was a backdoor that came to light on Monday.

15:23.880 --> 15:30.080
11 libraries in the Ruby Gems repository had some form of malware backdoor.

15:30.080 --> 15:33.240
And he's really making the case through this entire article.

15:33.240 --> 15:38.500
And I'm forced to agree that malware authors and attackers have figured out go after the

15:38.500 --> 15:43.600
source that users already trust, like the Ruby Gems repositories, or Webman from the

15:43.600 --> 15:46.640
project site directly from their site.

15:46.640 --> 15:47.640
People think that's safe.

15:47.640 --> 15:51.720
You know, I went to the Webman project, and I downloaded it directly from their website.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.320
I didn't get it off some mirror.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.320
I got it from the source.

15:54.320 --> 15:59.160
Yeah, and he does point out that this isn't unique to open source software, but in a way

15:59.160 --> 16:01.480
is kind of more prevalent there.

16:01.480 --> 16:05.640
And this really comes back to an issue that we're seeing time and time again with open

16:05.640 --> 16:10.320
source projects not necessarily being good at the other stuff.

16:10.320 --> 16:14.760
They make great software, but they're not necessarily the greatest sysadmins.

16:14.760 --> 16:19.960
They don't necessarily have all the best practices in place to stop this kind of thing happening.

16:19.960 --> 16:20.960
Right.

16:20.960 --> 16:21.960
And there's also the monetary aspect.

16:21.960 --> 16:26.360
A lot of times there isn't the money to pay somebody to maintain all of this.

16:26.360 --> 16:31.360
I guess I hope down the road, computers can solve this problem a little bit.

16:31.360 --> 16:36.040
It feels like computers can get better at recognizing these types of attacks, screening

16:36.040 --> 16:38.440
these vulnerabilities out of repositories.

16:38.440 --> 16:41.960
There's more and more systems we're seeing now around scanning repositories for vulnerabilities

16:41.960 --> 16:44.760
or having trusted publishers like the Snap Store does.

16:44.760 --> 16:50.960
And it seems like we'll settle on solutions, but it's this long meandering process to get

16:50.960 --> 16:51.960
there.

16:51.960 --> 16:56.940
Well, I was going to bring up Snap and Flatpak and that perhaps moving to these more modern

16:56.940 --> 17:02.720
ways of distributing software, we can hopefully build in some protections against this.

17:02.720 --> 17:07.200
Our user base has a really good shot at this because we are a little more aware of these

17:07.200 --> 17:12.560
issues than say your average Windows user might be or even your average Android user

17:12.560 --> 17:14.440
who goes into the store and just gets the freebie phone.

17:14.440 --> 17:16.900
They're not thinking about isolation.

17:16.900 --> 17:19.320
They're not thinking about the source of the software.

17:19.320 --> 17:23.280
So we have a leg up there that it's even something we're even aware of.

17:23.280 --> 17:28.480
Now what we do with that knowledge, that remains to be seen.

17:28.480 --> 17:32.660
I do think that the conversation around Snaps and Flatpaks has been productive in the sense

17:32.660 --> 17:38.720
that it's gotten the conversation in the user base going about isolated applications, about

17:38.720 --> 17:45.380
giving applications implicit access to certain things like webcam, your file system, hardware.

17:45.380 --> 17:49.080
That kind of thing isn't something that we even discussed three or four or five years

17:49.080 --> 17:51.440
ago before we started talking about this stuff.

17:51.440 --> 17:54.940
And it's raised the level of awareness in the user base.

17:54.940 --> 18:00.200
Now just about every Linux user that's been following this stuff for a while is aware

18:00.200 --> 18:05.080
that there's inherent security issues in X11 and that there's things that applications

18:05.080 --> 18:07.640
can do that they shouldn't be able to do.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.060
Those conversations are healthy.

18:10.060 --> 18:11.160
That awareness is healthy.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.160
Oh yeah, definitely.

18:12.160 --> 18:16.380
And recently my eyes have been opened to this because I've been trying to convert a Windows

18:16.380 --> 18:24.560
user who is somewhat obsessed with privacy and uses Signal and he's into VPNs and all

18:24.560 --> 18:25.560
that.

18:25.560 --> 18:30.180
I've tried to convert him to Linux and it's kind of getting there slowly but surely.

18:30.180 --> 18:36.560
And he raised the point with me that Linux isn't necessarily any more private than Windows

18:36.560 --> 18:40.240
because of things like applications not being isolated from each other and being able to

18:40.240 --> 18:42.040
send data around.

18:42.040 --> 18:45.840
And so from that complete outsider's point of view, I feel like he does actually have

18:45.840 --> 18:46.840
a point there.

18:46.840 --> 18:47.840
Yeah, I can understand that.

18:47.840 --> 18:53.560
My response would be the great thing about Linux is you can take it as far as you want.

18:53.560 --> 18:57.360
You could go to the cubes OS extreme, like you guys tried on Choose Linux recently, you

18:57.360 --> 19:03.280
go that far, or you could install a flat pack or a snap version of an application that is

19:03.280 --> 19:05.560
just slightly isolated or is completely isolated.

19:05.560 --> 19:10.120
You can dial that up and down, you can have a read only file system, all of that stuff.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.720
You just kind of just have to know how to do it.

19:12.720 --> 19:13.720
That's the barrier.

19:13.720 --> 19:19.320
And that's why surfacing this stuff to the users by default in a way that doesn't hamper

19:19.320 --> 19:21.960
power users I think is really important.

19:21.960 --> 19:25.840
Because I don't think we want to lose sight of the fact that Linux is used primarily by

19:25.840 --> 19:32.760
power users, developers, system administrators, tinkerers, enthusiasts, those of us who like

19:32.760 --> 19:35.800
to play and mess around with our computers.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.760
That's a lot of the core Linux user base.

19:37.760 --> 19:41.000
And so if you make an operating system that doesn't serve them, you're going to have a

19:41.000 --> 19:44.960
bunch of people that are forking projects and complaining all the time.

19:44.960 --> 19:50.480
But you have to balance that with presenting same defaults that provide protection and

19:50.480 --> 19:51.480
isolation.

19:51.480 --> 19:55.120
And I would, I'd be willing to wager in three to four years, most distributions are going

19:55.120 --> 20:01.440
to ship with the bulk of their core applications isolated, either as flat packs or snaps.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.040
It just seems like the way things are going.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.440
Well, probably because it comes down to trust.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.000
Who do you trust?

20:07.000 --> 20:09.160
Whose software do you trust on your computer?

20:09.160 --> 20:10.160
Right.

20:10.160 --> 20:15.520
Going back to Dan Gooden's piece at Ars Technica, it's the attacking the source, where the user

20:15.520 --> 20:17.360
places their trust.

20:17.360 --> 20:23.080
And so you really to have full security, you have to have verification and trust at each

20:23.080 --> 20:24.960
individual step.

20:24.960 --> 20:26.080
That's a lot more work.

20:26.080 --> 20:29.480
But I do actually think we're making good progress that direction.

20:29.480 --> 20:32.480
Better progress than the Windows platform.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.960
Not as good of progress as say, the mobile platforms.

20:34.960 --> 20:40.240
Well, that's been true for quite a while with iOS and increasingly so these days with Android.

20:40.240 --> 20:45.120
But come on, the biggest Android news of the week is that there's going to be no more desserts,

20:45.120 --> 20:49.600
no more sweets, no more Kit Kats and Oreos and all of that.

20:49.600 --> 20:51.920
It's just going to be Android 10.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.080
I was really looking forward to Android Quiche.

20:54.080 --> 20:57.360
I was really hoping this would be the one.

20:57.360 --> 21:02.280
I am a little confused by the choice to go with Android 10.

21:02.280 --> 21:08.240
If you check my Twitter feed, I retweeted a number of breakdown of all of the releases

21:08.240 --> 21:09.240
of Android.

21:09.240 --> 21:15.240
And if you count the betas, which is questionable, but if you count the betas, this would be

21:15.240 --> 21:19.060
the 17th public release of Android.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.360
And they're calling it version 10.

21:20.360 --> 21:26.720
Yeah, but then they had like various 2.1 here and whatever, they had a lot of point releases.

21:26.720 --> 21:31.200
And this is pretty much Android 10, isn't it?

21:31.200 --> 21:38.000
I mean, if you want to talk about in feature quality and completeness, maybe, yeah, I wouldn't

21:38.000 --> 21:40.960
call it version 13 because that's unlucky, that's where Apple's going next.

21:40.960 --> 21:44.120
But 10 feels like they're not owning their progress.

21:44.120 --> 21:48.480
They're like pulling a Microsoft here and just pretending like releases never existed.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.920
This completes Google's transition to the new Microsoft.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.400
They're now Neo-Microsoft.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.520
And they are complete with this crazy naming scheme.

21:57.520 --> 21:59.400
They have now checked all of the boxes.

21:59.400 --> 22:03.880
They just need to call Linux a cancer and then backtrack on it a few years later and

22:03.880 --> 22:05.440
totally embrace it.

22:05.440 --> 22:09.120
Just wait, that'll be during the Fuchsia keynote.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.800
Well, yeah, exactly.

22:10.800 --> 22:17.320
They do kind of have a fairly good argument, though, that if you're international, then

22:17.320 --> 22:22.120
some of the ice cream sandwich, for example, we have no clue what that is in this country.

22:22.120 --> 22:26.440
I literally thought it was ice cream and a couple of bits of bread when I first heard

22:26.440 --> 22:27.440
about it.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.080
But that's obviously not what it is.

22:29.080 --> 22:35.640
And in some languages and dialects, like L and R, are hard to distinguish.

22:35.640 --> 22:40.040
And so it was a bit immature, wasn't it?

22:40.040 --> 22:41.960
It was a bit of fun to start with.

22:41.960 --> 22:47.960
But to me, it feels like them kind of drawing a line under the fun side of it and being

22:47.960 --> 22:49.480
really serious now.

22:49.480 --> 22:52.720
Android is a serious product to compete with iOS.

22:52.720 --> 22:59.880
And we're not just a bunch of geeks over in California putting statues of donuts outside

22:59.880 --> 23:01.540
our offices.

23:01.540 --> 23:03.680
We are deadly serious now.

23:03.680 --> 23:08.780
They've rebranded the visuals to be much more, well, corporate, I suppose.

23:08.780 --> 23:12.800
And it just feels like Android growing up with this.

23:12.800 --> 23:15.360
Yeah, I wasn't having it ever, to be honest.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.480
I'm just giving a hard time for the go into 10.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.640
But I never liked the shenanigans.

23:18.640 --> 23:20.640
I just thought it was silly.

23:20.640 --> 23:28.540
It felt like a cute ploy to try to seem like a hipster little startup from a big mega corporation.

23:28.540 --> 23:32.000
And now with this rebranding that they've kind of done, they've redone the logo a little

23:32.000 --> 23:38.200
bit and the dropping of the desserts, it does feel like the growing up.

23:38.200 --> 23:42.620
They're breaking outside that enthusiast trap where they're trying to over accommodate the

23:42.620 --> 23:45.280
people that they use to get off the ground.

23:45.280 --> 23:49.720
And now they're trying to sell to the mass market, which is the inevitable outcome of

23:49.720 --> 23:50.720
the Android initiative.

23:50.720 --> 23:54.560
I think you make a fair point that some of these things don't make any sense outside

23:54.560 --> 23:55.560
the states either.

23:55.560 --> 23:59.600
That was never really, it never really seemed to make sense either that it was candy when

23:59.600 --> 24:04.800
Google is so like health food oriented, kind of imagery and never really got it.

24:04.800 --> 24:09.720
But it was a way to get some some retweets, I suppose.

24:09.720 --> 24:14.160
There was that little Easter egg where you could get the the Android version.

24:14.160 --> 24:17.480
And it'd be I just keep coming back to KitKat because that's the one that really stuck in

24:17.480 --> 24:22.400
my mind because it was the first one where they kind of sold out really and got a brand

24:22.400 --> 24:26.960
on board, especially Nestle, which is not exactly the most ethical company in the world.

24:26.960 --> 24:31.280
I guess my other only thing is I just like the way Android Q sounds like drop the candy

24:31.280 --> 24:32.600
thing and just keep the letter.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.480
Android Q is a rad name.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.920
That's a great name.

24:37.920 --> 24:42.660
But it doesn't matter Android 10, as it will be known, looks like a pretty solid release.

24:42.660 --> 24:45.680
My pixel device is ready and welcoming.

24:45.680 --> 24:50.880
It's funny that I've just updated to Android 9 this week through lineage OS 16.

24:50.880 --> 24:54.840
So I don't think I'll be getting Q or 10 anytime soon.

24:54.840 --> 24:57.200
Just gotta wait till you break the next device, Joe.

24:57.200 --> 25:02.480
Yes, I did have some problems this week, although actually, I saw today that a lot more of the

25:02.480 --> 25:07.480
OnePlus phones now are officially supported with lineage, which is good news, including

25:07.480 --> 25:11.200
the six, which was I think the last one with the headphone jack.

25:11.200 --> 25:15.480
So if and when my 3T dies, I might well be picking up a six.

25:15.480 --> 25:19.240
I gotta admit, I was eyeballing a couple of the one pluses at the sprint that we had recently.

25:19.240 --> 25:24.200
Alex really has a nice one plus, I could see that I may I might not get a pixel next time

25:24.200 --> 25:26.320
I might consider a one plus instead.

25:26.320 --> 25:31.360
Stay tuned and find out actually, stay tuned and find out all of the news in open source

25:31.360 --> 25:36.000
and Linux land go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes

25:36.000 --> 25:39.360
and linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

25:39.360 --> 25:45.400
Now here's a last minute FYI, I'm going to Lexington, Kentucky on the 29th.

25:45.400 --> 25:52.040
I'll be there at a meetup with a very special guest and a lot more details to come soon.

25:52.040 --> 25:56.200
So probably the best place to go is just meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting because we don't

25:56.200 --> 26:00.940
have it posted yet because we are still working out all the fine last minute stuff.

26:00.940 --> 26:06.360
But if you're in that area, Lexington, Kentucky on the 29th of August 2019, I'd love to see

26:06.360 --> 26:08.920
you at dinner meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

26:08.920 --> 26:12.040
So that means you've only got a few days after hearing this.

26:12.040 --> 26:16.100
So yeah, make sure you do check out meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

26:16.100 --> 26:21.520
Now we have some new content for you as well extras dot show, go check that out.

26:21.520 --> 26:24.760
And we have a flash briefing skill now for your Echo device.

26:24.760 --> 26:28.560
Once a week Linux action news in your flash briefing, go check that out.

26:28.560 --> 26:33.520
If you'd like to get us there on your smart Echo thing, I wouldn't know about that.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.200
I don't have things listening to me all the time.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.200
I'm afraid.

26:36.200 --> 26:38.280
I think I've got one in nearly every room now, Joe.

26:38.280 --> 26:41.560
It's it's like a rash.

26:41.560 --> 26:42.560
That's one word for it.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.560
All right.

26:43.560 --> 26:47.240
Well, we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.000
I'm at Chris LAS.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.520
I'm at Joe Rissington.

26:50.520 --> 26:51.520
Thank you for joining us.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.880
We will see you next week.

26:52.880 --> 27:08.880
Have a great day and I'll talk to you later.
