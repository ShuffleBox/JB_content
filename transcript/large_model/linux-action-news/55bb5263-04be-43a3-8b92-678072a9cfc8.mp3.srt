00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,920
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 264, recorded on October 26, 2022, I'm Chris.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
And I'm Wes.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,600
Hello Wes, let's do the news.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,440
Canonical announced Ubuntu 22.10 this week, codenamed Kinetic Kudu.

5
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:25,040
This interim release seems to have a particular focus on the Raspberry Pi.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,440
I don't mind that at all.

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,720
Ubuntu 22.10 now supports the MicroPython goodness on various microcontrollers, including

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:39,240
the Raspberry Pi Pico W. Also, the Ubuntu graphics stack has transitioned to KMS, meaning

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,560
developers can run Pi-based graphical applications, say using something like Qt, without a desktop

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,680
session, and without Pi-specific drivers.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,200
You can see that's great for a lot of hardware installations.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,240
This complements also expanded support in this release of Ubuntu for all kinds of displays

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,480
like E Ink Hat series, the HyperPixel range, and even the Raspberry Pi official touchscreen.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:08,100
The GNOME desktop was updated to version 43, which includes GTK4 theming for improved performance.

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,160
And Pipewire also becomes the default audio system with 22.10, along with WirePlumber

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:21,020
as the session manager, making this now a common stack across modern Linux desktops.

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,920
And finally, an area that Canonical was drawing special attention to is their new Steam Snap.

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,920
They noted that it includes the latest Mesa, presumably with the ability to decode video,

19
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,440
and gamers can now be confident that they'll always be up to date, regardless of their

20
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,440
host OS, without needing to configure any of those gross PPAs that somebody came up

21
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
with.

22
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,240
And you know, maybe this isn't absolutely necessary on an interim release like this

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,560
particular one, but you could see how this Snap is going to be very useful on future

24
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,560
LTS releases.

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,280
But you can hear more of our thoughts on the overall release in Linux Unplugged episode

26
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,760
481.

27
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,680
Git T, a lightweight, self-hostable GitHub alternative written in Go, hits six years

28
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,880
old this week.

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,920
And for their birthday, well, they've had a few announcements, the biggest of which

30
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,760
is the formation of a company called Git T Limited.

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,360
Okay, they say of course, quote unquote, that Git T will remain open source, and they say

32
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,920
a community project.

33
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,960
It seems the primary goal of forming the company is around engaging in commercial support contracts,

34
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:34,360
instance hosting, managing trademarks, and offering part-time employment to some maintainers,

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,380
perhaps expanding that to full-time employment in the future.

36
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:45,160
One rather surprising aspect of this announcement though, is that it seems Git T is considering

37
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:50,600
creating a decentralized autonomous organization, or a DAO.

38
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,320
Now they say that's to preserve the community aspect of the project and contributors would

39
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,240
receive benefits based on their participation, such as from code, documentation, translations,

40
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:05,720
and perhaps even assisting individual community members with support questions.

41
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,480
Not a structure we see commonly adopted in open source, but possibly could be done well,

42
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,280
and of course could also be done very poorly.

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,960
But it is something we'll be keeping an eye on.

44
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,960
The Asahi Linux team shared some big updates on their path to getting Apple M-Series SOC

45
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,600
support in the Linux kernel.

46
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,800
The Apple M-Series CPU frequency driver is finally looking like it's in good shape,

47
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,280
which will definitely help the system manage performance, thermals, and power efficiency.

48
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,200
Yeah, that is really good because these laptops and some of these systems are famous for their

49
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,600
good battery life, and this is going to help accomplish that under Linux too.

50
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,480
It also seems that the GPU driver is getting a lot closer.

51
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,840
Originally they were really banging on this thing under Mac OS and trying to pass all

52
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,520
the compliance tests in theory under Mac OS and then move it over to Linux.

53
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,620
Well that's been done now, and now it's passing 99% of the compliance tests under Linux, which

54
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:14,800
means the driver is getting to a really good state.

55
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,920
While it might be a little hard to hear for those of us who still remember the excitement

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:26,040
of the 486 CPU, the discussion around maintaining support for that classic architecture in the

57
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,600
Linux kernel came up again this week.

58
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,080
After reviewing code that mostly just seemed to be a series of workarounds for various

59
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:42,120
older CPUs, Linus mused, quote, we got rid of i386 support back in 2012, maybe it's time

60
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,520
to get rid of i486 support in 2022?

61
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,960
He later went on to say, quote, so I really don't think i486 class hardware is relevant

62
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,960
anymore.

63
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,040
Yes, I'm sure it exists, but from a kernel development standpoint, I don't think they

64
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,800
are really relevant.

65
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,860
At some point, people have them as museum pieces, they might as well run museum kernels.

66
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:14,120
And perhaps what really matters, and was pointed out later in the thread, it seems no one really

67
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,040
wants to stand up and offer to do the work to maintain that support.

68
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:31,240
The i486 architecture debuted in 1989 and was succeeded by Intel's Pentium in 1993.

69
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,840
Linode.com slash LAN, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

70
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,840
It's a great way to support the show too.

71
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,480
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

72
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,920
It's simple, affordable and accessible to whatever your skill level is.

73
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,280
And they have the best support in the business because they're architected like nobody else

74
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,640
in the business.

75
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,360
Linode's how we run everything.

76
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,040
Whatever we built in the last couple of years, we deploy it on Linode.

77
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:58,600
My personal site, my family stuff, game servers, I run it personally on Linode too.

78
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,840
They have a Linux culture that runs deep.

79
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,840
They've got fantastic support.

80
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,040
And they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers out there that want to lock into their crazy

81
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
platforms.

82
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,920
But I also think Linode truly has the best performance.

83
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,160
And today they got 11 data centers around the world, with a dozen more coming online

84
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,160
next year.

85
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,000
And they have a bunch of great features besides just running your applications really well.

86
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,280
S3 object storage, cloud firewalls, easy to understand backups, Kubernetes support and

87
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,700
a dashboard for days.

88
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,280
To go build something, go learn something, try it for yourself for real.

89
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,400
$100 means you can really try it.

90
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,000
Linode.com slash LAN.

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,320
Go there to support the show and try it out.

92
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,920
Linode.com slash LAN.

93
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,320
Kalyde.com slash LAN and a big thank you to Kalyde.

94
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:51,840
Kalyde is endpoint security that uses the most powerful untapped resource in IT, your

95
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
end users.

96
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,120
They do things differently.

97
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,000
Instead of treating every device like Fort Knox that locks it down and makes it slow,

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,920
they work with your users.

99
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,720
Kalyde will automatically notify your team when their devices are insecure and give them

100
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,740
step by step instructions on how to solve the problem.

101
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,200
They reach out with a friendly Slack DM and educate them.

102
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,120
And for IT admins, you get a brilliant dashboard that lets you monitor the security of your

103
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,020
entire fleet.

104
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,880
Maybe it's a Mac, maybe it's Windows, or maybe it's Linux.

105
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,880
Kalyde supports it all.

106
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,480
And just a couple of days ago, their official macOS Ventura support dropped.

107
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,680
They're right on top of that kind of stuff.

108
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,880
It's truly great because in a snapshot, you can see if they have a password manager, if

109
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,760
they have their OS up to date, if they've been following the guidelines and the requirements

110
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,800
of IT.

111
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,840
And it's perfect for generating a report for yourself, for leadership, maybe an audit.

112
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
That's Kalyde really.

113
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,920
It's user-centered cross-platform endpoint security for teams that Slack.

114
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,940
You can really meet your compliance goals by putting users first.

115
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,160
You visit Kalyde.com slash LAN to find out how.

116
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,400
When you go there and activate a free trial, they're going to hook you up with a goody

117
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,280
bag too that includes a free t-shirt.

118
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:10,240
So that's K-O-L-I-D-E.com slash LAN, Kalyde.com slash LAN.

119
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,280
We end this week with a roundup of recent Red Hat news.

120
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,800
Now, Linux in the clouds, that's nothing new.

121
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,760
But an on-demand remote Red Hat Enterprise desktop is rather noteworthy.

122
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:30,080
Red Hat announced the general availability of RHEL Workstation on AWS, joining Ubuntu

123
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,080
and Windows, which both already offer remote virtual desktops on Amazon's cloud.

124
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,400
The product is basically just a virtual Linux workstation that can be accessed using a thin

125
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,640
client or just a web browser.

126
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,520
It's a cheaper alternative for some specific types of workloads and includes dedicated

127
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,760
GPU options and other G family accelerated instance types that are suitable for remote

128
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,760
workstations.

129
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,360
Yeah, that makes sense.

130
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,480
And hopefully it gives Red Hat a solid business reason to invest more in desktop technologies.

131
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,680
I note that customers with Red Hat's cloud access can use their existing subscription

132
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,920
to RHEL Workstation to deploy on AWS with no additional license required.

133
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,880
I mean, of course, you still got to pay for your machine time on AWS, but that's nice

134
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
to see.

135
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,920
And keeping things in a Red Hat theme here, Stratus 3.3.0 was released this week.

136
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,000
They say it includes one significant enhancement and several more minor enhancements, as well

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
as more than just a couple of stability and efficiency improvements.

138
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,940
Just a reminder for some of you out there, Stratus is a storage tooling solution from

139
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:42,540
Red Hat that leverages XFS and LVM to manage Linux storage devices and provides features

140
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,080
similar to ZFS and ButterFS.

141
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:53,600
And in 3.3.0, it's become easier to use additional space on devices and behind the scenes, Stratus

142
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,840
is a bit more conservative now when allocating space for the Thinpool metadata device.

143
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,560
That's also really nice to see.

144
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,400
There is some good tech in Stratus and some really good work going into it.

145
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,280
It's sort of a shame that it just doesn't seem to be the solution the industry wants

146
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
right now.

147
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,800
Thankfully, Fedora has ButterFS and that seems to be going great.

148
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,040
However, this week, we did get an update that Fedora 37's release will probably slip

149
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
again.

150
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,940
Yeah, you know, this happens sometimes.

151
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,200
As we record, the decision has not yet been finalized, but the team is trying to decide

152
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,840
how to deal with an impending critical open SSL update that was only just recently announced.

153
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,520
Understandable, and the patch won't ship until next Tuesday, November 1st.

154
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,260
It's going to be version 3.0.7 and it includes a fix for potentially multiple issues, one

155
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:50,360
of which has been marked as critical.

156
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,840
So as we record, like Wes said, the team is debating the best move.

157
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,600
You can follow Matthew Miller on Twitter directly.

158
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,680
For the latest, he'll have that, I'm sure, or, you know, tune in here because we'll

159
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,040
keep an eye on Fedora 37, that open SSL vulnerability, and everything else going on in the world

160
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,660
of Linux and open source.
