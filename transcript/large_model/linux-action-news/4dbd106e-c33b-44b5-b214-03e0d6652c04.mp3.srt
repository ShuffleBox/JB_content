00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,240
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open-source world.

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,280
This is episode 12, recorded on July 29th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,280
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,280
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,800
We have quite a lineup today for folks who love to run Linux on the desktop and maybe

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,400
something that we might look back and say was a bit historical.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,520
Why don't we jump into some of the interesting bits happening with the Ubuntu Mate project?

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,520
They have a new Alpha.

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,960
Yeah, Alpha 2 of 17.10.

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,560
Why are we talking about an Alpha?

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,920
Well, you kind of alluded to it last week, and now it's actually available to download.

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,680
This I think is the biggest release 17.10 for Ubuntu Mate since they became an official

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
flavor.

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,560
Okay, it's only an Alpha at this stage, so you're not going to run it on production systems,

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,640
but it's well worth checking this out because if you remember at the beginning of Ubuntu

17
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,940
Mate, they picked up a ton of Unity refugees, people who did not want to change.

18
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,040
They were used to GNOME 2.

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,680
They were happy with it.

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,400
All this Unity, this is a completely different way of doing things.

21
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,040
We're not interested anymore, and so they happily settled on Ubuntu Mate, and they've

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,880
been quietly using it ever since.

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,960
And now Unity is going away, and so the next release of Ubuntu proper is going to have

24
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,040
GNOME, and so there's a whole bunch of people who got used to Unity 7, and now they want

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,760
to keep using that same workflow.

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:43,520
And so Martin Wimpress, Wimpy, has been working away in the background with his mutiny layout

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,400
for the panels, and now it's got global menus.

28
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,300
It's got the HUD, so you can search within applications.

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,680
He's basically trying to do the same thing again for the people who actually changed

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,920
to Unity who don't want to change back.

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,680
Right, giving them a landing spot, essentially, to move to, a new island for them to jump

32
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
to.

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,720
And you left out my favorite new feature, which is complete super key support throughout

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,920
several of the different panel layouts, which is not only was it the representation of touching

35
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,160
multiple projects, which is interesting to see the way the Ubuntu Mate project is doing

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
this.

37
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,360
They'll decide on a feature, and then they'll work across multiple projects with multiple

38
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,160
different maintainers to get the feature implemented.

39
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,640
So it's in the settings daemon, it's in the Mate menu, it's in the Brisk menu, it's in

40
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,960
the dock applet, and now you can also do super key and then other buttons.

41
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,840
So say you want to activate menus and other key bindings that use the super key.

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,880
It's not just hard lock to menu launching.

43
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,400
Now I want to step back for a second and double down on why we're talking about an alpha right

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,640
here at the top of Linux Action News this week.

45
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,540
I believe this is the ripple effect of the announcement from switching from Unity to

46
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,280
GNOME by Mark Shuttleworth.

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,960
This is the ripples of that.

48
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,040
You not only have a pretty solid 1710 base because it's mostly an improvement bug fix

49
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,520
if you take off all the GNOME and GUI stuff, you remove all the transition to GNOME stuff

50
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,000
and 1710 is pretty rock solid.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,520
And so the Ubuntu Mate project has been able to leverage that and they already have something

52
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,520
that I've been able to use at the alpha stage.

53
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:27,880
And I ran the mutiny tweak specifically, you go into the Mate tweak applet and you say

54
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:34,220
I want this layout for my panels and I chose the mutiny interface and then boom, and you

55
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,520
have the mutiny layout.

56
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,280
And it's pretty close, Joe.

57
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
It's pretty close.

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,120
And you turn on something like Compiz, which I recommend and I double checked with our

59
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,400
friend Martin Wimpress, is still being maintained by a canonical employee.

60
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:50,080
So Compiz is still getting the love and you turn on the mutiny interface, you enable Compiz

61
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,660
and it gets really, really close, Joe.

62
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,320
The only problem I can see is the dash isn't there yet.

63
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,680
And it's something I spoke to Martin about today and I suggested Sling's Cold, which

64
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,920
is a launcher which is quite similar to, I suppose it's more similar to Gnome Shell really,

65
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,360
but it's got that kind of big icon touch screeny type interface.

66
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,920
He said he's working on something.

67
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,000
It's not Sling's Cold because he tried it and it didn't work that well, but he's working

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,200
on that final piece basically.

69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,760
But the important thing to not forget here is that you don't have to use this mutiny

70
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,760
layout.

71
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:34,400
You can use traditional Ubuntu 10.04 Gnome layout, or he's got a Redmond layout, which

72
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,840
is what I would use because look, I like the Windows XP layout.

73
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
What can I say?

74
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,640
Or rather the Windows 7, I suppose.

75
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,640
I like to have a panel at the bottom, I like to have a menu in the bottom left, I like

76
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,880
to have my clock in the bottom right.

77
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,000
So it's versatile, it's diverse.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,940
You can have whatever you want with it.

79
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:58,080
And thanks to Marte Tweak, it's a few clicks away to decide what you want.

80
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,300
And you've got OS X or Mac OS, Clone, you've got Pantheon, which is subtly different and

81
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,360
more like elementary OS.

82
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,960
The thing is that he's got a lot of choices here, but it's, I should say they really,

83
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,920
because it's not just Martin, it's the whole Ubuntu Marte team.

84
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:20,000
But there's all these choices and it's really simple to select between them.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,640
And that to me is where this is really shining.

86
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,240
It's not like Plasma where you've got all the options in the world, but it's quite hard

87
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
to discover them.

88
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,720
This is all in one place, it's really simple.

89
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,440
And I've talked about moving to Plasma because XFCE is what I use and maybe that isn't going

90
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,800
to make the transition to GTK3 and stuff.

91
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,320
But let's be realistic.

92
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,380
If I'm going to move anywhere, it's basically going to be to Ubuntu Marte.

93
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:48,280
I was wondering, I mean, you seem pretty impressed by it.

94
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,040
But one of the things that I like about Ubuntu Marte and the Marte desktop in general is

95
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,160
where they have forked, I agree.

96
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,600
So my favorite fork is Kaja, the file manager, which is more like the original Nautilus file

97
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,280
manager with a lot more features.

98
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,360
Yeah, well, instead of stripping the features out like Nautilus has had, it's just kept

99
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,360
them.

100
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
Yeah.

101
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,360
So what would push you over?

102
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,360
Why not make the switch?

103
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,900
Is it just simply no reason?

104
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,900
Everything's working?

105
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,900
Yeah.

106
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,320
So at the moment, I'm on 16.04, things are working fine.

107
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,160
If 18.04 is working fine, then I'll just switch, you know, just upgrade Ubuntu to that.

108
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,800
And it's only if they don't make that transition to GTK3 and things stop working and I actively

109
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,360
have problems, then I will have to move to something else.

110
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,880
And I was looking at possibly Plasma and there's a lot of innovation there.

111
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,760
It is a very attractive proposition.

112
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,440
And I am going to look around, obviously, at that point.

113
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,080
But to be honest, it's as if I've got Ubuntu MATE in the bank.

114
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,560
It's like, well, I've got that, that's safe.

115
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,600
And if I can't find anything else, then I will default to that as the thing that I will

116
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
move to.

117
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
That's funny.

118
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,120
That's really similar to my situation right now.

119
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,720
I can see myself trending and I'll tell you why I think I see myself trending towards

120
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,880
Ubuntu MATE.

121
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,280
If they've nailed it down this well in 17.10, imagine how good it's going to be for 18.04

122
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,760
with the LTS release.

123
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
Yeah.

124
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,200
I feel like I'm going to end up there, but in the meantime, I'm looking around and I'll

125
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,240
say this, give it a full development cycle.

126
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,280
So don't make your big switch yet.

127
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,560
But when Ubuntu MATE 17.10 ships, if you are in love with your Unity 7 desktop, consider

128
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,840
giving it a spin because not only is it really dang close right now, but obviously the project

129
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,480
has a goal here and they're going to keep iterating on this and they're just going to

130
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,980
keep making it better and better.

131
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:43,320
And that's unfortunately something your Unity 7 desktop now lacks.

132
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,360
I'm so glad that I never got involved with having to use Unity and stuff.

133
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,600
I went to XFCE probably about two years before that whole Unity thing happened and I was

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:59,720
just sitting there, everyone's stressing about this and I'm just sitting here using XFCE.

135
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
Eating popcorn.

136
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,560
You know who else was just sitting back eating popcorn is Fedora users.

137
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,580
And we have a tweet from Matt Diem, the guy that runs the Fedora project, and this looks

138
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,840
really positive for the new Fedora release.

139
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,760
Yeah, it's early days, so we don't know exactly how they're doing, but from the numbers, it's

140
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,320
not exact numbers, it's relative numbers to the other releases, it's looking really good

141
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,540
for Fedora 26.

142
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,960
It looks like, I don't know, is it speculation to say that maybe there's some Ubuntu users

143
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,080
who are thinking, well, if I'm forced to go to GNOME, then maybe I'll check out some other

144
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,480
distros that are running it.

145
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,480
I could throw a little more anecdotal evidence your way if you want.

146
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:47,440
I have received more so than any Fedora release in recent memory, feedback from Fedora users

147
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,840
who said they're making the upgrade right away to 26.

148
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,600
I don't know if I've heard from many folks that have made the switch, but I'm definitely

149
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,520
hearing from folks that are existing Fedora users jumping into this one.

150
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:04,200
I feel like my experience with Fedora upgrades for the last three or four release cycles,

151
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,600
which has been near problem-free, is representative of what a lot of other people's experience

152
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
has been.

153
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,560
Well, isn't that because Fedora are not making any massive changes?

154
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,840
It's just incremental improvements, and it's just kind of upgrading the packages, upgrading

155
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:25,260
the kernel, and a few little features here and there, but there's nothing major.

156
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,720
There's no moving from one desktop to another.

157
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,880
There's no GTK2 to GTK3 stuff.

158
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,600
If you're using 25 and you go to 26, it's going to be slightly newer, and it's going

159
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,960
to work just as well.

160
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,560
Yeah, I suppose that might be right.

161
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,480
It feels to me that because the Fedora project is working on such crazy future stuff right

162
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,360
now that that's unfair to them, but in reality, if you just look at the distro that we know

163
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,400
and love today, the Fedora that we think of today, yeah, I suppose it has just been iterative

164
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
updates.

165
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:58,000
But where the project is going, Fedora might not look anything like it does today.

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,680
And one of those is Voltron, the modular server preview by the Fedora community.

167
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,000
When I was talking with Matthew Miller on Linux Unplugged about where the Fedora project

168
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,660
is going with this, it sounds like they're trying to address the issue of upgrading individual

169
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:16,840
components or installing newer parts of the system without affecting the rest of your

170
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
Fedora system.

171
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,840
So you essentially can virtualize out certain package sets and repos.

172
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,000
Surely they should just be using snaps, shouldn't they?

173
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,800
Yeah, or flat packs, I suppose.

174
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,720
I think they're trying to address it at the package manager level.

175
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,040
There's still efforts going on there to make this work right.

176
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,120
And as a result, they're kind of building some new tools, and they're kind of improving

177
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,640
some existing tools.

178
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,720
So this seems like it could just overall bring up the quality of the Fedora project.

179
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,760
Well, when I spoke to Matthew last, he wasn't very keen on snaps because it's very Ubuntu

180
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,760
specific.

181
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,880
You have to have the Ubuntu runtimes.

182
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,160
And so it's not a surprise really that they're working on their own.

183
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,040
Well, I mean, the flat pack is more for the desktop, isn't it?

184
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,200
And whereas Boltron is very much server focused.

185
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,720
So you can see why they don't want to just say, okay, let's submit, I suppose, and let's

186
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,840
just accept that we're using snaps.

187
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,440
They're doing their own thing as well.

188
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,080
And what's probably going to end up happening, this is Linux, this is open source, you're

189
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,340
never going to have one thing, are you always going to have a few competing technologies.

190
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,960
And ultimately, that's probably going to be good, because you're going to have different

191
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,240
options there.

192
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,600
You can either do it the Boltron way, or you can do it the canonical way with snaps.

193
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,240
I suppose if I had the option, I would prefer to have a sanctioned Fedora packaged version

194
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,920
of PHP, NGINX, or Ruby, or whatever that I install via DNF, and then just update via

195
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,920
DNF.

196
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,760
Having to install a flat pack or a snap and all of that is a lot of extra stuff just to

197
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,200
have a specific version of NGINX.

198
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,000
So I think Boltron could really have something to offer here.

199
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,360
And we may find as this develops further that it's more nuanced and they don't quite solve

200
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,360
the same problems.

201
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,080
Because in the back of my head, I'm combining this with other initiatives they have like

202
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,460
Fedora Atomic, where they're using OSTree to do snapshots, then they're working on a

203
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,160
workstation version of that too, Joe.

204
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,040
So you take an entire snapshot of either the server or the workstation before an update,

205
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,840
and then you make a hard switch.

206
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,560
And if something breaks, you can just go right back to the version that worked fine.

207
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,240
And that would be really nice on like a workstation class machine in a corporate environment.

208
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,080
So I could see them really kind of combining a bunch of different features and making Fedora

209
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,560
attractive for both server workloads and desktop workstation workloads.

210
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,760
Yeah, and I suppose you could say that another organization and company that are making that

211
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,880
easy is SUSE.

212
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,160
And they've gone down the B2FS or ButterFS route to make that happen with the snapshots

213
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,560
and everything.

214
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,720
And OpenSUSE Leap 42.3 has been released.

215
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,320
And it's bringing it more in line with SLE, SUSE Linux Enterprise.

216
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,160
Is it fair to say it's basically the same at this point?

217
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,960
Yeah, it's essentially SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 Service Pack 3.

218
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,520
And then they've identified a few areas where they've deviated from the base system.

219
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,800
So they avoid major version updates in the base system and in the desktop through this

220
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
whole update.

221
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,960
So it's really a pretty consistent, rather unadventurous matter, as they put it.

222
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:23,240
So don't picture this as like a huge, big leap forward because we're talking it's Plasma

223
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,680
Desktop 5.8 long-term support version, which is the default desktop, Gnome 3.20, which

224
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,320
is exactly the same one that's used by the SUSE Linux Enterprise that it's based on.

225
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,140
So yeah, Joe, I'd say if you know what you're getting with SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 Service

226
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,320
Pack 3, then you know what you're getting with OpenSUSE Leap 42.3.

227
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:46,280
Yeah, the fact is that SUSE Linux Enterprise, well, the clue's in the name.

228
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:52,720
It's an enterprise distro and it feels like OpenSUSE is drifting more towards that.

229
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,840
And to me, that makes it not that exciting.

230
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:02,160
I don't know, I hate to admit that, but I mean, even their version numbers, 42.3, it's

231
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,360
not something that's going to grab headlines, is it?

232
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,480
And to me, it just seems like a solid distro that in reality, I'm probably never going

233
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,480
to use.

234
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,520
I suppose I kind of agree.

235
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,720
I think it's exactly what it needs to be for the market it's going after.

236
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,840
And I think that's why they go out of their way to say it's a rather unadventurous matter

237
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:26,840
because they're trying to tell you this is a safe, stable way to use OpenSUSE so that

238
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,960
you can use in the enterprise.

239
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,360
I wonder if this will be successful because you combine this with their tumbleweed initiative

240
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,720
and then you can kind of, you can choose whichever side of the spectrum fits you better where

241
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,760
you can go a little more rolling or you can go way more enterprise.

242
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,120
I think that's a very unique proposition and I think it's got to be leading to growth.

243
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,660
For me, what it comes down to, my background with SUSE is I ran SUSE extensively for years

244
00:14:54,660 --> 00:15:00,240
in a large enterprise as both the desktop and the server.

245
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,800
And then I've stayed current with OpenSUSE over the years on and off testing it.

246
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,760
And I found it to be pretty good distribution.

247
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,120
It doesn't really work for me though with Yast.

248
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,600
I'm actually not a big fan of Yast and all of the files it touches and how slow it is.

249
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,840
And I'm also not the largest fan of ButterFS.

250
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:23,920
And back when I originally used SUSE, they were huge proponents of RiserFS.

251
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,240
And so as it being the default and I was installing that distribution for the support, I put RiserFS

252
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
on everything.

253
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:36,300
And then Hans had to go murder his wife and the Linux community completely abandoned RiserFS.

254
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,960
And of course, SUSE kept on shipping it, kept on leaving it as default, kept on, kept on,

255
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,640
kept on until one day we were moving to XFS and I was left with all of my file servers

256
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,100
having to be converted.

257
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,260
And then it's funny to see that repeat itself now with ButterFS.

258
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:55,880
So for me, that combined with the changes to the package manager over the years, which

259
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,440
seems to be a really great package manager now, but of course, I've been around since

260
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,280
the early days when I was using red carpet to manage software on OpenSUSE boxes.

261
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:08,920
So I've really been there for a lot of transitions and they just kind of lost me the third or

262
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,400
fourth time they sort of changed the package manager out.

263
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,920
And so I don't ever see myself using it either because it's just too different of a Linux

264
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,160
distribution for me.

265
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,840
But I can watch it from afar and go, I love the two different approaches, rolling and

266
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
stable.

267
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:30,100
I think OBS and also where you can remix a box is the build service and whatnot is all

268
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,640
of that is really a nice asset to the community.

269
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:41,960
So they seem to have some great stuff, but like you, not ever really gonna run it myself.

270
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,860
Last.ting.com, thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Action News and thanks to everybody

271
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:52,960
for visiting last.ting.com where they'll take $25 off your first Ting device or if you bring

272
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,100
one, check their BYOD page, they'll give you $25 in service credit.

273
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,760
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

274
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,120
It's really simple, $6 for the line and then you just pay for your minutes, your messages

275
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,240
and your megabytes.

276
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,860
No contract, no early termination fee.

277
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:18,920
You can bring a device, they have a GSM or CDMA network or you can buy one from them.

278
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,240
No crazy software pre-installed.

279
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:26,800
It's really a nice system, everything you'd expect nationwide coverage.

280
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,700
People love Ting and you will too.

281
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,480
Go to last.ting.com and by the way, just a quick tip, if you share a video telling Ting

282
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:41,520
why they're a great fit for your family, you could win one of five Moto E4 Ss and $250

283
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,720
in Ting credit which would last you a long time.

284
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,840
You can find out more on their Twitter page, at Ting FTW or their blog.

285
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,520
Just do me a favor and start by going to last.ting.com.

286
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:59,160
Right Chris, we have to talk about Flash, there's no other way about it.

287
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,160
Even though it's not really Linux related, even though you can kind of run it on Linux,

288
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,120
even though you probably shouldn't, it's been the biggest news story of the week in tech

289
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
generally.

290
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,520
So I think we have to at least cover it a little bit.

291
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,200
Every Linux user cares too.

292
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Yeah.

293
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,400
So Adobe announced that Flash will die at the end of 2020.

294
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:26,480
That is three and a half-ish years away, which to me seems a reasonable amount of time.

295
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,040
All too often Google will just dump something and give you a few weeks notice or a few months

296
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,040
notice.

297
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,500
I think this is the responsible way for Adobe to do it, for them to accept defeat, but say

298
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,420
that they're going to keep doing security patches and even features as needed.

299
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,480
They said, I don't think there's going to be too many of them coming, but you never

300
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,760
know.

301
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,560
And they are going to encourage people to move to open standards.

302
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:54,400
It's funny how they twisted the words in the announcement to say that they've always embraced

303
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
open standards.

304
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
Well, yeah.

305
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Okay.

306
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Adobe.

307
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Yeah.

308
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Nice one for that.

309
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,000
The hype, I guess, positioning, you might say, the well positioning of open standards

310
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,440
like HTML5, WebGL, and WebAssembly features, I think strongly in this blog post and for

311
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,080
a long time Linux user, it's really something to see Adobe promoting HTML5, WebAssembly,

312
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,360
and WebGL and saying they're killing Flash.

313
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,720
Like that's a weird thing to be reading as a Linux user on Adobe's web page.

314
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Yeah.

315
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,680
I've never been a massive fan of Adobe, I must say.

316
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:32,280
Photoshop's pretty good until it got really bloated, but I've never liked them as a company,

317
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,200
whereas this, I can't fault it.

318
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,360
They are accepting defeat, they're giving plenty of time for people to move over, and

319
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,400
they're promoting open standards at the same time.

320
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,280
We're living in a topsy turvy world again.

321
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
Yeah.

322
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,120
The only thing I would ask for is maybe if they could have done this five years ago.

323
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,120
But other than that, it's actually a pretty good move.

324
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
Yeah.

325
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,280
And if they could give us a tool to convert SWF files into an open standard, that would

326
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,280
be nice as well.

327
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,660
Oh, an open standard.

328
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,760
Who needs that, Joe?

329
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,480
Just let Flash die.

330
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
Its time came.

331
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,940
It had its reign.

332
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,360
It's time to move on.

333
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,260
Let's all just let Flash pass gracefully.

334
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:14,740
But what about all the old animations, the old games, and more importantly, the old educational

335
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:21,720
resources that were made in Flash and are still relevant and still being used by people?

336
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,480
Oh, those new market opportunities for developers to come along and rewrite it in WebAssembly

337
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,480
and WebGL.

338
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
You were talking about that.

339
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,480
Yeah.

340
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,080
Well, yeah, it's always good to create work for the tech industry.

341
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,400
I'm not going to complain about that, but the reality is that a lot of that content

342
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,120
is just going to be left to rot.

343
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,120
There is that.

344
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:45,760
Perhaps, that is the motivation behind a petition to open source the Flash spec.

345
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,180
Yeah, you knew this was coming.

346
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,840
You could hear me teasing.

347
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,080
This is a petition that says, hey Adobe, why not open source the Flash spec?

348
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,240
It'd be good for everyone and it would be a good solution to keep Flash projects alive

349
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,540
and safely archived for many reasons.

350
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:04,640
We don't know how this is going to be done, they say, but that's the beauty of open source.

351
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,120
Well, I would imagine that the higher ups at Adobe thought, yeah, that's a great idea.

352
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,920
Let's have a quick look at the source code.

353
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,480
Oh, no, no.

354
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,080
Well, you see, Joe, you don't have to worry.

355
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:22,120
The open source community is full of magical unicorns because this petition, quote, right

356
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,280
from their page here, we understand that there are licensed components that you cannot release.

357
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,540
Simply leave them out with a note explaining what was removed.

358
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,720
We'll either bypass them or replace them with open source alternatives, comma, using our

359
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,120
magic pony dust.

360
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,320
They didn't put that part, but I think that was a typo.

361
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,120
Yeah, and more importantly, what about all the comments that say, this is an ugly hack,

362
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,920
but it kind of works, so let's leave it in.

363
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,640
I want the comments to say, this should screw over Silverlight.

364
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,640
Yeah, exactly.

365
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,760
Yeah, I don't know if this petition is going to go far, but it seems very optimistic.

366
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,560
It's also up on GitHub with a whole outlay of different references and discussion points

367
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,120
and pointing out that Flash is an art medium.

368
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,240
I make fun, but there is some seriousness to some of this.

369
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,440
There are things that would be nice to be able to say.

370
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,800
Toss up on archive.org and run in 10 years.

371
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:20,080
Well, I read through the Newgrounds post on this, and Newgrounds, to me, you think Flash,

372
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,360
you think Newgrounds, right?

373
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,520
Or at least traditionally, I have all the animations and games and stuff on there.

374
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,960
And they've basically said, well, we haven't really been using Flash for about 10 years

375
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,760
at this point, and we're not really bothered by this.

376
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,960
So I don't think it's as big a deal as some people would make out.

377
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,120
But in terms of open sourcing it, I think that is just dreaming.

378
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,560
And I think that the best case scenario here is Adobe is going to release a free as in

379
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:54,760
bare but locked down proprietary tool that will convert your SWF file into something

380
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,400
that is vaguely usable with open standards.

381
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,360
Hmm, that would actually be a decent compromise, because in some sense, if we had an open source

382
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,520
Flash, it may never go away.

383
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,720
Well, we've already got one of them, Gnash and all that kind of stuff.

384
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,040
Yeah, this is a good time for everybody to go double down on Gnash.

385
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,160
Yeah, we just want it to go away, don't we, at the end of the day.

386
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,880
And probably you're right, open sourcing it is just going to prolong that agony and just

387
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,640
make it never truly go away.

388
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,360
But I think that even if it was open sourced, it doesn't have to go away to go away, if

389
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,360
you know what I mean.

390
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,400
All it takes is the major browsers to stop supporting it, and then it's effectively gone

391
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,880
away anyway.

392
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
That's very true.

393
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,120
The Debian projects probably isn't too concerned with all of this Flash nonsense, but they

394
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,200
are a bit more concerned with reproducible builds.

395
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,260
Yeah, so when I first got interested in open source, one of the first things that occurred

396
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,880
to me was, okay, so we've got all this source code.

397
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,440
And then I learned, okay, so that a lot of it has to be compiled into binaries.

398
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,720
And it's like, well, how do I know that that binary is made from the source code and doesn't

399
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,540
have a few backdoors slipped in or some extra code?

400
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,400
And given the different compilers that people are using, the different systems they're running

401
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:15,360
it on, you traditionally, and even in a lot of cases now, you can't produce a binary that

402
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,880
is exactly the same, that has the same hash as the one that you're sucking down from your

403
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,880
package manager.

404
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,440
I wonder if this is even more of a concern in the Linux community where you have distros

405
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,240
that are re-spinning and they're using packages from an upstream distribution, but you never

406
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,220
really know what they're doing when they're re-spinning their desktop wallpaper.

407
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,480
They could be including different versions of the applications than what say Debian has

408
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,640
in their official repository and you wouldn't know.

409
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,560
Well, put it this way, I'm not going to lose any sleep over it, but at the same time, if

410
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:55,600
I know that you've got a reproducible build that you can have exact same binaries as it

411
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,120
should be, I might sleep that little bit better at night, put it that way.

412
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
I agree.

413
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,160
So something interesting that developed this week was a post over at lwn.net that we'll

414
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
have linked in the show notes.

415
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,080
I think it was from the mailing list, so it's kind of a nice readable format.

416
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,080
I didn't realize this, but the efforts that we've been hearing going on in other Linux

417
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,880
distributions like Arch and Fedora and OpenSUSE and Tails, these are all in coordination

418
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,920
with the Debian reproducible builds project and they've set up a cross communications

419
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:31,800
and support project agnostic namespace at reproducible-builds.org.

420
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,040
So this is a real community effort that's developing here.

421
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Yeah, and on the Debian side of things, if you look at the architecture that most people

422
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:47,000
are actually interested in, which is the MD64, 94% of the packages available for Debian are

423
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,280
reproducible at this point, which is virtually all of them.

424
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,680
That is a big step.

425
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,320
That is huge.

426
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,680
That really makes me sleep soundly, put it that way.

427
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,080
I think they are trying to raise awareness, though, because there are some projects where

428
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,560
they filed bugs saying we need this or that fix to be reproducible and it's just kind

429
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,500
of sat there for a couple of years now.

430
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,520
So they are trying to raise awareness that we need a little bit of help from the maintainer

431
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,160
side to get this all working.

432
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,960
Well, I think that if anyone is going to coordinate something like this, Debian seems to be a

433
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,800
very good project to do it.

434
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,400
Yeah, and the effort seems to be a worthwhile effort, too.

435
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,400
So it's nice to see.

436
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,840
It looks like FreeBSD and NetBSD are also getting in on the fun.

437
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,040
So that's kind of pretty cool to see.

438
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Yeah, I wonder if the BSD Now guys are going to talk about this and accept that they're

439
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,600
getting help from Debian and Linux.

440
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,680
I wouldn't bank on it.

441
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,680
So we do have an update on a story we touched on briefly in the past.

442
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:46,480
Mozilla has an initiative underway to bring voice recognition to the masses.

443
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,840
And I wanted to just talk about Common Voice for a moment because they touch on something

444
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,440
that I don't know if gets a lot of consideration.

445
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,520
Common Voice, if you recall, is a project to sort of open source voice recognition or

446
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,680
at least make voice recognition available to the web.

447
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,200
And they frame this in a really interesting way.

448
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,840
They talk about today's speech recognition technologies largely being tied up into just

449
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,840
a few companies that have really heavily invested in them.

450
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,120
And that's essentially down to Google, AT&T, IBM, and Nuance.

451
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,960
And if you want something outside the browser, you essentially license it from one of those

452
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,960
companies.

453
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,860
And like in the case of Nuance, you can actually pay up to a penny per invocation.

454
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:34,200
So that means, say, you're Mycroft or whatever, and you're using Nuance, and your users are

455
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,840
sending you $0.01 per query.

456
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,520
So per time, they say, hey, Mycroft, what is beans or whatever.

457
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,880
That's going to add up really, really quickly.

458
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,120
That's going to be hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars before you've even

459
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
realized.

460
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
Yep.

461
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
Absolutely.

462
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,440
And so Mozilla's point here is this is becoming a much more common way to interact with our

463
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,600
devices.

464
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:02,120
And soon, users, and maybe already, will have expectations of interacting with the web that

465
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
way.

466
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
I don't know if that's true or not.

467
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
I don't really see it.

468
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,960
My kids, who are not the greatest spellers yet, because they're very young, they're actually

469
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,960
getting pretty good.

470
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,120
And one of the ways that they get around the web is by using voice dictation, because they

471
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,280
have no problem with that.

472
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,800
They hit the button, they tell the thing what they want, and boom, they've got it.

473
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:24,280
And I could see that really becoming big in education spaces and in all kinds of usability

474
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,280
scenarios.

475
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,680
So there is probably a legitimate need for some sort of opening up of speech on the web.

476
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,980
And Mozilla's got to be the company to do it.

477
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,920
But it feels like a big uphill battle.

478
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:41,120
And they're trying to rally other browser companies to support a common web speech API,

479
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,440
which is a W3C community group specification that would allow developers to write speech-driven

480
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,000
interfaces that would use this service.

481
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,120
So it would sort of open this up, make a more competitive market.

482
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,080
The thing is, this is a very expensive thing to do.

483
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,640
But at the same time, they're crowdsourcing a lot of the audio content that they need.

484
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,840
And I've been doing 20 minutes here and there of verifying the various things that people

485
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,080
have read in.

486
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,680
And I've donated my voice as well to it.

487
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,440
So they've got the community side of things, to some extent.

488
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,880
But the resources that they need, let's face it, they've got Yahoo billions, or at least

489
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,160
millions to play with.

490
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:26,880
And we've talked many times about how Firefox is not doing massively well and Thunderbird

491
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,160
they've basically dumped at this point.

492
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,720
So it's not like they don't have the resources to do this.

493
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,400
And I think that if this really is the future, I'm a bit curmudgeonly about this.

494
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,400
I'm not seeing it.

495
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:43,160
I know you've wholeheartedly embraced it with Alexa and all that kind of stuff and Siri

496
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
on your phone.

497
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:48,920
But if this is the future, then Mozilla needs to be part of that.

498
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:55,880
Because say what you will about them, they do want to drive openness.

499
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,960
Their solution to everything is the web, which, OK, well, maybe this is the right thing to

500
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,000
do with a web API.

501
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I don't know.

502
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,440
I'm not 100% convinced about that.

503
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,400
They seem like the right company to do that, though.

504
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,400
Yeah.

505
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,240
Either way, I'm glad that they're involved with this.

506
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,400
Because I trust them more than I trust Google or Apple or Microsoft or Amazon.

507
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,520
I don't know if it's the future, but I do think it's going to become definitely another

508
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,200
primary input method.

509
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,840
Just sort of like Touch didn't replace the keyboard or mouse, same thing.

510
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,640
I don't think Voice is going to replace anything, but it's going to definitely supplement input.

511
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,640
But we'll have to see.

512
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,140
And hopefully, this is an area where Mozilla can do some real good.

513
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,840
And the place they have the most leverage is the web.

514
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,640
So this seems like a recipe for success.

515
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,560
And I like that they're keeping us updated.

516
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,440
