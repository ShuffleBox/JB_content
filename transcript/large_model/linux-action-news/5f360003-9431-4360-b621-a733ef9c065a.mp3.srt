00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,560
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 211, recorded on December 26, 2021.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,560
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,560
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,840
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,640
And this week, we're not doing the news.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,640
Not this week.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,720
No, we're going to start with an update about the show itself.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,840
Starting next week, January 2nd, Linux Unplugged will be moving into LAN's current Sunday

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,320
time slot.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,760
That means Linux Action News will be moving to a little later in the week to hopefully

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,600
better capture the news cycle.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,720
Right, that and really kind of balance out the entire Jupiter broadcasting release schedule

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,720
as well.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,240
So, starting in the new year, all going to plan, of course, the next episode of Linux

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,560
Action News will be out January 6th, and then every Thursday after that.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,000
We'll monitor this adjustment and watch for your feedback at linuxactionnews.com contact.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,320
But the underlying goal here is to better position both LUP and LAN to sort of play

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,240
to their relative strengths.

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,960
And don't worry, I know a lot of you out there are Monday LAN commuters.

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,520
Linux Unplugged will be in that time slot.

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
It'll be there for you.

22
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,040
And it'll be better than ever at linuxunplugged.com slash subscribe.

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,920
We're just kind of moving things around on the board a little bit for the new year.

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,720
But with that business of show out of the way, let's get to the predicting.

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,240
Well, first, we've got to own up for last year, and I guess I'll start.

26
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,680
I thought that by this time, Mozilla would probably have just killed Pocket.

27
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,340
But no, seems like Pocket is still alive and kicking.

28
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,840
I liked this prediction, not because I wanted to see Pocket die, but because I thought it

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,160
was both possible and a bit bold.

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,040
Because you know, this time last year, we weren't really sure what was going to happen

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
with Mozilla.

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,980
It seemed like this was going to be a make or break it year.

33
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:56,400
But overall, 2021 worked out to be a better year for Mozilla than I think either one of

34
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
us expected.

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,680
And I don't think they got to a position where they needed to make cutbacks like this.

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,900
Because I listened back to the episode, Wes, and it sounded like that was your angle on

37
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,320
this was, well, they're gonna have to make cuts because things are trending badly.

38
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,560
And this is where they're gonna cut.

39
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,920
Yeah, I think I've just been questioning how invested have they actually been in Pocket?

40
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,200
Now I'll admit, I do give it some clicks when I'm using Firefox, I do have some articles

41
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,400
that I think are interesting.

42
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,440
But it's just a small piece of the evolving story of how does Mozilla get money, right?

43
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,440
Like I mean, they're still at least in 2020, really dependent on their search revenue from

44
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,200
Google, something like 86% of their revenue came from that source.

45
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,440
So well, their services are growing, still seems like an open question.

46
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,520
Yeah, I agree there.

47
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,320
Their VPN service has seen some good growth there.

48
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,920
There's some good trends, better trends at the end at this point than when we did this

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,920
show last year.

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,800
All right, I'll own up to one of mine, which I think I got right.

51
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,920
But I'm going to preface this, listening to this right now, it's going to seem like this

52
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,280
was an obvious one.

53
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,560
But when I made this prediction, Alma Linux hadn't been announced yet.

54
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,180
We had just really learned about the end of the traditional CentOS release.

55
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,640
So I predicted that at least three CentOS clones would ship essentially a 1.0 or their

56
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,680
first stable release in 2021.

57
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,040
And that's exactly what happened Alma Linux, Rocky Linux, Springdale Linux, and a few other

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,560
clones did end up shipping.

59
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,480
Not I guess a huge surprise, although for a little bit there, some of us thought maybe

60
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,600
Rocky wasn't going to actually make it.

61
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:38,280
All right, I have a couple of thoughts here, but let's start with, what is Springdale again?

62
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,560
Because I don't think we've cited that previously on Linux Action News.

63
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,320
No, I had to go look because I knew Alma and Rocky had done it, right?

64
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,640
And I was like, well, okay, who else?

65
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,660
Because I don't think Scientific Linux is presently shipping.

66
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,080
So I had to go find another one.

67
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,000
And it's a thing and they've shipped an ISO.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,880
So I guess it counts, I think.

69
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,680
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

70
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,400
I mean, it does make me think one uncertainty we had was we didn't really know where they're

71
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,000
going to be one, where they're going to be two, three, or a whole bunch of clones.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,840
Because I mean, once you've got some in the space that prove it out, you can just keep

73
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,840
copying.

74
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
It's open source after all.

75
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,720
Yeah, I almost am surprised we didn't end up with like 10 or 15.

76
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,560
You know, and of course, like nine of them are horrible.

77
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,920
But it does seem like it's just maybe a harder task than, oh, I just copy the source RPMs

78
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
and rebuild it.

79
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,120
I think it turned out to be a harder job than that.

80
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,740
So but we did get at least a handful of them out there.

81
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,160
And then I think the other thing that we didn't really know, but we have a much clearer picture

82
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,140
of now is there's a lot of folks that just seem to be happy with stream itself and are

83
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,040
just sticking with CentOS and streaming.

84
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,960
And then something we learned on Linux Unplugged last week, pretty sizable people said, screw

85
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,440
it, I'm going to Ubuntu.

86
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,200
And none of us predicted that because, you know, it just seemed like too much of a pain

87
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
in the butt.

88
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,680
Yeah, that definitely caught me by surprise as well.

89
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,320
But speaking of Ubuntu, it's my turn again.

90
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:11,080
I predicted, hoped even perhaps that Ubuntu would ship SystemD HomeD sometime in 2021.

91
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,040
And I'm sad to say that didn't happen.

92
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,760
Did anybody, did any of the major desktop distros, I should say, ship SystemD HomeD

93
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
by default?

94
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,760
I don't think they did.

95
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,160
And in that episode, we were like, well Fedora will probably do it.

96
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,320
I don't even think, I mean, the version of SystemD that has it may have shipped.

97
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,780
But you specifically put yourself into a corner when you said, not only will the bits ship,

98
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,280
but it will be configured and enabled by default.

99
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,120
And you said Fedora is too certain.

100
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,360
So I'm going to go for a risky pick and choose Ubuntu because you had like this, this really

101
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,360
nice optimistic dream that they were going to be pushing the desktop technology stack

102
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,880
forward very aggressively in 2021, which just didn't really pan out.

103
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
No.

104
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
Wow.

105
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,880
Yeah.

106
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,880
So naive.

107
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,760
I think kind of the story we've been talking about sadly is some desktop disappointment

108
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,800
with Ubuntu, with Canonical's efforts there.

109
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,080
I mean, a lot still happening on the server side, but it just has not been the space to

110
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,360
watch for exciting changes or innovation on the desktop.

111
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,640
You never know though, Wes, there is an LTS coming up, things could change.

112
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,920
My next one was pretty bad.

113
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,720
You know, this was one of those where I thought maybe I was onto something because I was reading

114
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,980
tea leaves, which in other words is mailing list posts.

115
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,280
You don't even drink tea.

116
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
I know.

117
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,720
You know, it hurts the tummy, but I thought BcashFS would make it into the Linux kernel

118
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
in 2021.

119
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,960
I didn't necessarily think any distributions would use it or do anything with it.

120
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,720
But I thought, you know, by the end of the year, a shipping stable version of the Linux

121
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,040
kernel would have BcashFS mainlined.

122
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,160
And the things that I was reading in the mailing list were that they had hired a dedicated

123
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,800
tester.

124
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,240
There was a bunch of things they'd already identified.

125
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,240
It looked like they were on track to have some major stuff dialed in by summer.

126
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,720
And that, you know, if they got those bugs fixed by summer, then I had expected by, you

127
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,000
know, winter to be mainlined.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,960
And it just didn't, it just didn't happen.

129
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,120
And you know, it's funny because here we are now at the end of 2021.

130
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,760
And I'm seeing some of that same stuff that makes me think maybe 2022.

131
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:18,400
You know, cause I could almost make that prediction and say it's going to happen in 2022.

132
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,000
But I am not, I may save it for Linux Unplugged.

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,040
And I will own up to the fact that it did not ship in 2021.

134
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,080
I got that one wrong, unfortunately, despite how much I would have loved to see that.

135
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,080
I would have loved it.

136
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
It just would have been so great.

137
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
Yeah.

138
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,200
And you know, that definitely shouldn't take away from Kent Overstreet's hard work continuing

139
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
the development.

140
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,640
I mean, on one, on one hand, I'm a little disappointed.

141
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,640
I think we're all excited to see what BcashFS might offer.

142
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,200
But on the other side of that coin, this is a final system after all, and it's better

143
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,680
to get it right than fast.

144
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,520
Linode dot com slash LAN.

145
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,520
Linode loves Linux.

146
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,280
And I love Linux too, so I can tell, you know, you can't fake that kind of thing.

147
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,120
And it's how we run everything now.

148
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,000
Like we've built everything out on Linode for the last couple of years.

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,880
You should really try it out because I'm sitting here telling you it's great.

150
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,920
And that's after years of now actually using it in production, running my business infrastructure

151
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,080
and running my personal stuff, you know, the kind of stuff you never want to go down because

152
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,960
you don't want you don't want things to be down for for your customers or, in my case,

153
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
your audience.

154
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,020
And you don't want things to be down when you're just sitting down for a few minutes

155
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,640
with the kiddos to play a little game, you know, like maybe you maybe got like 15, 20

156
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
minutes to play a game.

157
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Right.

158
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,280
You don't want to deal with crappy performance or outages.

159
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,880
That's just not the time for that kind of thing.

160
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,000
And I've never had that problem with Linode.

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,040
And you know, there's been opportunities for them to be tested, like this recent log for

162
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,500
Jay vulnerability, Linode really stepped up to the plate on that.

163
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,240
If you're curious about what I'm talking about, go check their blog, go check their Twitter

164
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,240
feed.

165
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,900
I mean, they were just following this stuff from day one, making sure everybody is solid

166
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,960
and taken care of.

167
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,020
And they just have the best support in the business phone ticket, email, whatever your

168
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,560
method is, they're there every day of the year.

169
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,720
They don't do that escalation thing where they try to like pawn you off on some some

170
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,680
like, you know, first layer tech thing.

171
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,520
No, they take care of you.

172
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,560
They handle it right there.

173
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,800
There's no there's none of that.

174
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,480
It's really nice to know that's there.

175
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,500
But here's the best part when you go to Linode.com slash land, you get $100 to work with.

176
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:21,100
That's Linode saying they have confidence that if you actually put this thing into production,

177
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
they know you're going to like it.

178
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,740
All right, cuz I mean, they could give you like 10 bucks, 15 bucks, then you could run

179
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,240
some of their rigs for like two, three months, right?

180
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,220
Because they got great prices, they're 30 to 50% less than the major hyperscalers out

181
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,220
there.

182
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,560
But with $100, you could build real infrastructure, or you could really learn an entirely new

183
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
system.

184
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,060
Instead of even wanting to build an environment from scratch using Ansible or Terraform.

185
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,540
This is your opportunity.

186
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,220
Go do it and support the show.

187
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:53,660
Have some fun, learn something and support the show Linode.com slash land.

188
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,480
And a big thank you to Ting Linux.ting.com stop overpaying for cell service.

189
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,000
Why not do it right now at the beginning of a new year just start saving from the very

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,080
beginning Linux.ting.com go there and take 25 bucks off whatever you end up going with

191
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,960
a new device or a new plan.

192
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,120
You see Ting is an MVNO, a mobile virtual network operator.

193
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,420
That means a couple of things.

194
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,280
That means they have several nationwide networks for you to choose from.

195
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,040
That also means that your device is likely already compatible because of that multi network

196
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,600
compatibility.

197
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,840
And then on top of it, it means that they're not digging holes.

198
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,680
They're not fighting with local authorities.

199
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,960
They're not trying to get new laws passed and lobbying the state to get new towers installed.

200
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,720
They don't have to manage any of that.

201
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,480
So their business focuses on the customer and creating value and they've nailed it.

202
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,000
That's why I've been a customer since 2013.

203
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,760
It's just a smarter way to do mobile.

204
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,240
It's probably how the industry would have to operate today if they were to like reset

205
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,780
everything from the ground up.

206
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,840
They have plans that start around ten dollars a month and they kind of go up from there

207
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,280
depending on what you need.

208
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,040
A lot of their stuff is just like so simple that you just go to the website and it's just

209
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,160
one of them is going to be obvious which one should work for you.

210
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,560
You know, they got plans with unlimited data, unlimited calls and every single plan has

211
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,640
the nationwide LTE and 5G coverage.

212
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,640
How great is that?

213
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,080
And maybe one of my favorite things is no contracts.

214
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,280
They stay flexible.

215
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,000
Over the years, I've dialed back my usage.

216
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I've increased my usage.

217
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,200
I've gone on road trips.

218
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,240
I've been all over the place and Ting has remained flexible and awesome and a great

219
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
value.

220
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
So here's how you get started.

221
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,240
You go to Linux.ting.com.

222
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,880
You check your current phone, you create an account, you pick the plan that's right for

223
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
you.

224
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
Ting is going to send you a SIM card.

225
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,960
You're going to pop that SIM card into your phone and then you're going to get activated

226
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,080
in minutes because they have a really nice clean dashboard.

227
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,080
Boop, boop, boop.

228
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
You're ready to go.

229
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,880
You didn't have to talk to a human if you didn't want to.

230
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,160
If you do want to, they got great customer support.

231
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier.

232
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,220
Ting has great plans.

233
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,600
You got to go check them out.

234
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,560
Kick off a new year and save a little bit of money and take 25 bucks off whatever you

235
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,200
find at Linux.ting.com.

236
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,640
And now it's time for our 2022 predictions.

237
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,280
I'll start things off.

238
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:07,240
I think that sometime in 2022, SUSE will release a RHEL clone of their very own.

239
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:13,480
Now, this is something we've speculated a bit before, specifically in LAN 2.10, but

240
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,200
they already offer RHEL support and there were some clues from Apple and our friend

241
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,360
Carl George that maybe there's something more in the works.

242
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,200
I could see it happening and 2022 seems like the year that it might.

243
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,840
Yeah, I thought if it was going to happen, they would have tried to have shipped before

244
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,760
end of life for CentOS.

245
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,920
I suppose there's still a few more hours on that clock as we record right now.

246
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,360
I say you're still going to get it if they release it in 2021 because this is either

247
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,360
going to ship or they're going to just shut down the whole thing.

248
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,760
The rumor mill has it that once we started talking about it on the show and it started

249
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:55,080
showing up on Twitter, the word went out internally to shut off all like Apple repositories.

250
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,920
So we no longer have any external numbers to go on.

251
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,360
But what we did see for a short period was what seemed to be a SUSE designed and built

252
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,520
RHEL clone that was connecting to external repositories and checking in for updates.

253
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,400
Quote, Liberty Linux.

254
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Right.

255
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,800
Liberty Linux was the tagline and there was multiple connections.

256
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,840
It wasn't just one or two or three, it was many.

257
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:25,600
And this could be kind of like a kind of really calculated move by SUSE to make it easy to

258
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,900
migrate from RHEL to a SUSE infrastructure.

259
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,080
They did something similar like this back in the NetWare days, where they made it really

260
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,680
easy to transition from NetWare to SUSE in part by emulating NetWare.

261
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,660
And it was a strategy that worked for them.

262
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,880
So I think it's a solid bet, Wes.

263
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,740
Yeah, you know, I mean, they've already got robust build tools out there.

264
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,680
So I don't think that's going to be too much of an issue.

265
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:54,280
They're familiar with the RPM ecosystem, and they already provide commercial enterprise

266
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
support.

267
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,360
I mean, if anyone's going to try this, seems like it might be them.

268
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Right.

269
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,500
That's the other aspect of this that we forget is they do have like a cheaper than RHEL patch

270
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,040
service that you can get that will patch SUSE boxes and RHEL boxes today.

271
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,800
So you can actually purchase a SUSE tool to patch your RHEL boxes.

272
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,840
So they're already probably maintaining, I would imagine, their own RPM repositories.

273
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,840
They're already taking the source RPMs and building them, possibly.

274
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,160
So it could just be they're increasing that infrastructure and growing that out.

275
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,240
I hope we see it because I think it's going to shock people to see SUSE shipping a RHEL

276
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
clone.

277
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,480
And I think it's going to make for a fun story if it ever happens.

278
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,220
And if it doesn't happen, if we're sitting here this time next year and it hasn't shipped,

279
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,780
it's going to be like, what the hell happened?

280
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,400
Because we saw it showing up on the numbers.

281
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,080
Something was out there called Liberty Linux coming from SUSE IPs.

282
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,080
All right.

283
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,280
Now, mine, I feel like my next one is a pretty sure bet.

284
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,000
I think both of us just want at least one win is what I feel like these first ones are.

285
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,040
And that's mine.

286
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,320
This one, everybody's going to roll their eyes when I say it.

287
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,840
But, you know, might as well try to get an easy win.

288
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:59,040
Asahi is going to ship, Asahi Linux is going to ship an installer for getting their version

289
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,080
of Linux or like, you know, an installer that gets another version like Arch or Debian or

290
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,280
something like that on M1 hardware.

291
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,960
I imagine it won't be an entire standalone distro, but more of a tool to get an existing

292
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,520
distro on an M1 Mac.

293
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,480
But it could be its own distro too.

294
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
It's pretty broad.

295
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,760
But that's something that's like targeted at end users and not just potential developers

296
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,260
or people trying to contribute to the bootstrapping effort.

297
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,860
Something like you might use to run a real desktop day to day on an M1 machine.

298
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:32,080
It seems like you could you could see a scenario where a developer edition, which is already

299
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,080
kind of out there.

300
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,360
There are there's already docs on how to do it by hand.

301
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,960
And you could see maybe a little rougher version of an installer coming to market first.

302
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,400
That is really for like your first wave adopters.

303
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,920
And then by the end of the year, there's something that's really even before the end of the year,

304
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,920
you know, midway, there's something targeted for average users who average Linux users

305
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,840
who just, you know, maybe picked up an M1 and they want to try getting Linux on it.

306
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,600
Now that's maybe a year old or so.

307
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,440
I think that's going to become as you think about it in terms of M1 hardware age right

308
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
now.

309
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,880
You know, when even when the project, especially when the project first started, some of these

310
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,960
people they just got themselves a 12 to $2,000, $1,300, whatever it is, MacBook, it's precious.

311
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,560
You don't want to try slamming Linux on that thing right now.

312
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,520
But you know, a year, year and a half into it.

313
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,440
It's just you know, your old laptop at that point.

314
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,760
So yeah, once you take it for granted, you've already messed it up a couple of times and

315
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,960
had to reinstall.

316
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,920
What a great time for a new Linux installer to come out and for people to start slamming

317
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,020
Linux on them.

318
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,840
And I think that could also play well for a crowdfunded project.

319
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:37,280
So that's my prediction is that in 2021, you're going to see Asahi ship an installer for average

320
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
Linux users.

321
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,400
People are familiar with Linux and want to get it on an M1 machine.

322
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,200
I know it's kind of a it's probably a sure bet, but that also just speaks to the confidence

323
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
I have in the project.

324
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,800
Okay, well, my question then is, if that happens, is that what it takes for you to start trying

325
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,720
Asahi on your M1, Chris?

326
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,840
Oh, I think so.

327
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,240
You know, because I didn't even touch on like GPU accelerated graphics, because for me personally,

328
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,280
I don't even need it.

329
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,000
I would love to be able to run a headless M1 server in my RV off solar because, you

330
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,440
know, even under load, it's taken hardly any power compared to most systems.

331
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,720
I think it just make a great little headless server.

332
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,680
So yeah, I'm all about it as soon as they as soon as they're shipping, I'm installing.

333
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:22,560
Well speaking of neat things in small packages, my next prediction is that SteamOS will have

334
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,200
a community fork out there sometime in 2022.

335
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:31,520
You know, with the deck launching with people getting really excited, I could see the community

336
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,960
wanting to leverage some of Valve's hard work sort of stabilizing Arch and then shipping

337
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,520
something that kind of bridges the gap and makes it a little more useful for you know,

338
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,640
non strictly gaming uses something that makes the AUR easy to set up something just sort

339
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,400
of smooth the gap between regular Arch.

340
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,000
Something that says, Hey, you out there, you want a workstation that's gaming ready and

341
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,480
has a OS tree style file system?

342
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,640
Well, we've got a distro for you.

343
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,160
Something that strips away some of the branding, you know, sort of all that red hat to send

344
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,640
us where they make sure they don't have any custom logos or trademark stuff in there.

345
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,760
And then they, you know, they sell it as vapor Linux or I guess maybe not vapor that's already

346
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
out there.

347
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,000
You know, I don't know what what you call but something that's probably a play on valve

348
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
or steam, right?

349
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,640
And then you go download that thing coal powered Linux.

350
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:30,040
I'm not sure gasoline Linux, I don't know.

351
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,120
But you know, and maybe it's gotten maybe it's got like a script that installs steam.

352
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
I don't know how it works.

353
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,600
But I could totally see that happening.

354
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
I hope it does.

355
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,360
Actually, I'm gonna be really disappointed if this prediction doesn't come true, because

356
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,880
I want I want to try it.

357
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,680
Well, yeah, that's just it.

358
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,920
You know, I don't I don't know that I really I tried running the last steam OS kind of

359
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,440
as a day to day way back in the day, I could see playing with it briefly.

360
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:53,760
But you know, if there's not something that's really meant for that, I think I'll just

361
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,800
keep it for the gaming use cases.

362
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,760
But I am looking for another arch replacement.

363
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
I mean, who's not?

364
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,200
Well, I suppose step one will be just getting the deck to ship.

365
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,480
And then step two is going to be valve needs to release steam OS.

366
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,200
And hopefully they'll be good about it and release all the bits.

367
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Oh, geez, now that you say that that's a lot that needs to happen.

368
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,800
But fingers crossed.

369
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,300
There's some milestones, though.

370
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,600
You know, we can watch those milestones, we'll find out.

371
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,420
Okay, here is my next prediction.

372
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,840
It's a bit of a long shot, but boy, do I really hope this is going to happen.

373
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,440
So I'm looking at the Raspberry Pi lineup, and I'm liking what I'm seeing with the compute

374
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,240
module a lot this year.

375
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,520
I think that's made the Raspberry Pi a totally new kind of interesting for me.

376
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,880
My Pi 400 is one of my best little pieces of hardware I've ever bought.

377
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,840
I keep it set up in my office ready to go for like basic business stuff, you know, for

378
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,480
when I have to be a businessman.

379
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,160
And I think that's really nice.

380
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,240
So I thought maybe I'd try to make a prediction in this realm.

381
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,720
And I was looking at the Raspberry Pi 4, which has been really solid for me, I've been using

382
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,080
it as a server.

383
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:59,960
And you know, they launched the Pi 4 Model B in June of 2019 towards the end of June

384
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,960
2019.

385
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,220
And they have a lot going on.

386
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,480
And there is a worldwide part shortage.

387
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,160
So this is, it's hard to say, but I feel like enough hedging already out with it.

388
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:18,840
I think maybe we're gonna see a Raspberry Pi 5 at least announced in 2022.

389
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,920
I don't know if it's gonna be able to ship though, because the supply chain woes.

390
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:28,280
In fact, what we could end up seeing is a Pi 4a, you know, because you've got something

391
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,360
that they've remarked on is that their engineering team hasn't had a very good collaborative

392
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,360
year with work from home.

393
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,160
It's been tough on their team.

394
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:41,040
They've had supply chain issues, parts costs are going up, the devices they're making right

395
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,160
now, they're making them as fast as they can.

396
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,240
So what we may end up only getting is a Pi 4a.

397
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,440
But my long shot would be a Raspberry Pi 5.

398
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,560
That would be, you know, and then if I could go all the way, Wes, Raspberry Pi 5, with

399
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:58,280
a 16 gig of RAM option, and eMMC, but that's just not gonna happen.

400
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,320
Well, okay, what comes in the 4a then?

401
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,560
The 4a, I think, is a yeah, it's a CPU bump, you know, eight gigs of RAM still, I don't

402
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,320
think the 4a is a big change, other than some maybe like board or, you know, PCI layout

403
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,240
changes, maybe something in that regard, something that makes me look at and go, hmm, you know,

404
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,960
I could use it for, you know, something new or something extra.

405
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,640
It's tough to say because the compute module actually brings so much to the table that

406
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,920
I'm not, I'm not totally sure, but I could always use more memory and I could always

407
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,920
use more CPU.

408
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,600
Well, I'm just curious to see, you know, I think with the 4, it got really close to sort

409
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,720
of using a Pi in the Chromebook territory of performance and like, you know, low end

410
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,280
Linux desktop, so maybe a 4a, but I think certainly a 5 could really take that to the

411
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
next level.

412
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,280
How do I make this?

413
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
How do I square this?

414
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
Because it's like, it's really two predictions.

415
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:51,560
We're gonna either, I just, I think they're gonna, they're gonna rev the current 4, right?

416
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
That's what I'm going for.

417
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:56,360
The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is gonna get a rev of some kind.

418
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,480
It's gonna, I don't know how they're gonna do it.

419
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,640
It may replace it altogether with the Raspberry Pi 5, or they may be like the B+.

420
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,680
If they, if the, if the Pi 4 hasn't been replaced, you know, with like a next iteration at this

421
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,120
time next year, I think it's a, I think it's a loss because like if they update the Picos

422
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,000
or the Pi 400, that doesn't count.

423
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,520
It's gotta be the flagship big Pi.

424
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Ah, the flagship Pi.

425
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,520
Okay.

426
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
Okay.

427
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,840
Well, I think you're going to get this one.

428
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,600
I'll be surprised if not, but time will tell.

429
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
We will see.

430
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,560
Um, I read a couple of interviews that make me think it's not going to happen because

431
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:39,720
they were set in expectations low, so we'll see, but I'd love to see it.

432
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,280
And then we have, we have a Linux action news tradition here on the show.

433
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,280
I don't know why, but it started with Joe and I talking about Bitcoin and trying to

434
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,280
make our annual Bitcoin predictions.

435
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,280
And it just seems like an impossible thing to do, but we did want to do a little reflection.

436
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,920
Yeah, we like being wrong.

437
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,280
And what better way than to try to speculate about the price of cryptocurrency?

438
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,320
There's no better way.

439
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,280
There's no better way to be wrong faster either.

440
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,000
And 2021 was a wild year for cryptocurrency and Bitcoin in general.

441
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,600
At the beginning of the year, Bitcoin shot up to nearly $40,000 at the end of January.

442
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:21,160
April 3rd, it broke $63,000 and then it just ramped down and up for the rest of summer.

443
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:27,880
And then in early October, an all time high of $68,000 was hit and then crashed down about

444
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:31,920
40% for about four days and then has built up some of its losses.

445
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,400
And it's now, as we record sitting around 51,000, but here's some interesting numbers

446
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,160
for you, Wes, as of 2021, the entire crypto market, when you include like Ethereum and

447
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:48,800
a lot of the altcoins is now worth $2.4 trillion.

448
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,880
It's truly just become its own economy.

449
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,080
And to put that in perspective, crypto market is 2.4 trillion.

450
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,480
All of France's economy is 3 trillion.

451
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,160
India's economy, 2.8 trillion.

452
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,680
If you take out just Bitcoin, Bitcoin is a trillion on its own, over a trillion on its

453
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:12,320
own, which is larger than Italy's economy by a lot.

454
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,120
Just Bitcoin alone is barking at the size of India's economy.

455
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,560
I mean, you know, that's something, Wes, that is, those are huge, huge numbers.

456
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:27,160
Well, and it just seems to be far more present just in the culture, right?

457
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:33,560
I mean, many folks who are otherwise not interested in technology or speculating in stocks, well,

458
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,640
they know what crypto is, and maybe they have a small amount of it.

459
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,720
It's certainly become more popular in institutions.

460
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,960
Yeah, that's been, it's been a big trend this year, some large institutions, including JP

461
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Morgan.

462
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,640
Their crypto strategy go all in El Salvador, the city of Miami.

463
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,240
These really interesting ones, Coinbase had their IPO, rocky year, but they're doing kind

464
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,540
of better now towards the end of the year.

465
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:05,960
Those all were big institutional moves that started to legitimize cryptocurrency for,

466
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,000
I think, another wave of adoption.

467
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,160
You still have tons and tons of critics and skeptics out there, but I think another wave

468
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,420
of adoption happened in 2021.

469
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:19,500
Like you're saying, getting really close to that near mainstream, and it's really interesting

470
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,800
how it sort of reminded me a lot of Linux's early uptake.

471
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,560
A lot of people thought, what does it do that Windows doesn't do or network isn't doing?

472
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,580
What is the critical app of Linux?

473
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,960
What is its critical function?

474
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,860
A lot of people were skeptical about the security model, about open source and free software

475
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:40,440
developers just donating their time, about IP issues, a lot of early skepticism.

476
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,400
And then some of us really saw some potential in it and really stuck with it, and then 30

477
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,520
years later and it dominates the world.

478
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:53,280
Bitcoin, it's been around since 2009, and if you look at its trajectory and you compare

479
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:57,160
it to previous adoptions, a lot of people will compare it to the internet and say that

480
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:01,220
it has a faster pace of adoption than the internet did in its early years.

481
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,000
But I don't know if it's an apt comparison because Bitcoin is more like a protocol.

482
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,740
It's more like the slow adoption of TCP IP.

483
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:16,040
When TCP IP was announced, there was dozens of competitors, NetBui, IPX, Appletalk, Token,

484
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,480
all these different network standards that all of these different vendors tried to push

485
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,920
and sort of pooh-poohed all over TCP IP.

486
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:28,080
But over time, it just became the great unifier, became the great nullifier, and it just took

487
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,080
over.

488
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,280
And it seems like we're seeing a similar trajectory that just has become obvious in 2021.

489
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:39,000
Coin Ring was obviously trying to hint at our crypto future.

490
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,700
The other thing that happened was a China ban on mining, which represented a ginormous

491
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,480
portion of the Bitcoin network.

492
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,960
They cracked down and the network hash rate dropped, and then the mining spun up mostly

493
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,600
in Western countries, and now the hash rate's higher than it was before China did the crackdown.

494
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:02,760
So it's hard to say like, what could 2022 possibly, what could happen, right?

495
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,520
You have world economies that are a mess.

496
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
Who knows?

497
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,320
It just feels more impossible than ever to make a prediction because there's so many

498
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
factors now.

499
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
Well, that's just it.

500
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,320
I think it's more in the front of everyone's mind.

501
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,080
We're waiting on decisions about regulation.

502
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,000
And I think we're waiting to see what 2022 brings for the overall market.

503
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,200
I'm kind of curious to see what bears out when we do have more of a bear market.

504
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,720
If people are forced to start to divest in some of their holdings, do they choose to

505
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,880
do that in stocks or gold or is crypto the thing that they sell first?

506
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,640
I don't know, but I'm curious to see what happens.

507
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,200
So here's my prediction, because I got a price prediction, but I actually think there's something

508
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,680
else that probably should be called out here.

509
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,080
So right now, like if you just look within the last week or two, you'll find several

510
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,400
accredited, intelligent people who say Bitcoin's going to collapse.

511
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:59,280
Carol Alexander, professor of finance over at Sussex University or Sussex University,

512
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:05,040
said that she expects Bitcoin to tank as low as $10,000 in 2022.

513
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,060
She says it's going to wipe out the gains of basically the last two years.

514
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,040
And if you're invested in Bitcoin, you should get out now.

515
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,320
It has no fundamental value.

516
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,000
And then you've got others that say it has intrinsic value because it's a digital currency

517
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,780
you can send anywhere around the world.

518
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,420
There's a fixed cost to mine it.

519
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,760
The utility of it gives it its worth.

520
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,140
And then, of course, like humans, it's worth whatever we say it is.

521
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,840
And these are two battles that have been playing out since 2009.

522
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,320
And I think in 2022, one side's going to have to shut up.

523
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,800
Either this thing's going to the moon side's going to win, or the people that say this

524
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,880
thing like your Peter Schiff's or your Carol Alexander's say this thing's going to crash.

525
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,420
They're going to have to shut up by the end of 2022, because it's going to get to a point

526
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:50,800
where it's just either going to be ludicrous to make those claims anymore, or it's going

527
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,120
to be they were right all along.

528
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,600
And so we will end that debate, and in the process of starting all of this out, it's

529
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,960
either going to be heralded as the moment right before the big crash, or the moment

530
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,800
right before it took off Bitcoin, at least momentarily in 2022, I predict will hit $70,000.

531
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,280
I see you're not stepping too far out, right?

532
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:19,120
If it was a 68 or so back in October, then just hitting 70 sometime in the year.

533
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,720
That doesn't seem too outlandish.

534
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,400
But I guess my question is, where do you think it's going to end up?

535
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,400
Right?

536
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,720
Okay, we might have another, you know, summer of crypto where everyone's excited, but December

537
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,120
next year, where are we going to be tough to say, huh?

538
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,400
Because it does, it does seem like more and more of the normals are learning about cryptocurrencies

539
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,760
and theorem included.

540
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,200
And here's something else I've noticed.

541
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,440
Linux appeals to a narrow band of people that are trying to get something done or have a

542
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,800
certain philosophy about the world.

543
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,840
But a lot of people like making money.

544
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,640
And so people who are not technically inclined, are interested in making money.

545
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,740
And I gave my son a little bit of Bitcoin for Christmas.

546
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,300
And he's 12 years old.

547
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,620
You know what, though, you know what, Wes, he got it immediately.

548
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:10,160
And the fact that it was digital, and not like tied to a physical metal or something,

549
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,960
is a complete non issue for my son who, you know, has lived in a Minecraft style metaverse

550
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,820
and just works with digital stuff.

551
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,820
He's done online schooling.

552
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,520
All of it is digital to him.

553
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,720
It's all digital.

554
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,960
And so to him, the fact that it's a digital asset is huge because he's 12 years old, right?

555
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,160
Now all of a sudden, he's basically got a bank on his phone.

556
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,940
And he's thinking about how to convert this cash that he's got into that.

557
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,200
So that way, maybe he'll grow that a little bit over time, just thinking like the way

558
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,240
he just got it made me realize the younger generation, like, you know, younger than you

559
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,760
and I are even more digitally inclined, they're even more just tuned into this kind of thing.

560
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,240
And so you got those people coming online.

561
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,880
They're gonna have some spendable money, you know, 18, 19, 20, 25 year olds, they're gonna

562
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,960
be coming online, they're gonna be able to get the cash app, they're gonna be able to,

563
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,960
you know, get the strike app.

564
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,480
Well, that's just it, right?

565
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,280
That it's so much easier now, you don't have to understand necessarily how to host your

566
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,440
own wallet or be running software on your system.

567
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,760
There's friendly apps that let you buy stocks and crypto at the same time.

568
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:20,200
Also you got the fact that as of 2021, 90% of all bitcoins have been mined.

569
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,360
Only 10% of the 21 million now remains.

570
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,440
That is going to create a supply crunch.

571
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,360
Also you mean just thinking of price pressure, the Bitcoin miners are holding, right?

572
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,600
The exchanges are at a three year inventory low for Bitcoin right now, because the Bitcoin

573
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,080
miners are holding waiting for the prices to come up.

574
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,520
But you've also got inflation in the US that's really bad right now, not just the US, right?

575
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,800
I mean, Bitcoin is a worldwide currency and inflation is going rampant in all kinds of

576
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:55,160
places and there's going to be a percentage right or wrong that see Bitcoin as an inflation

577
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,160
hedge.

578
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,560
So those things I think are going to drive the price up.

579
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,880
But then you have the fact that here in the States, interest rates are going up.

580
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,000
So cheap or free money is going away.

581
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,380
So the institutional investors are going to pull back.

582
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:13,600
So it really seems like it could be anyone's game, but when you factor in the limited supply,

583
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,520
the fact that inflation is a problem, mainstream adoption, easy technological innovations,

584
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,240
the fact that we really haven't seen the benefits from the lightning network coming online yet,

585
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,260
which is going to make transactions super fast and super cheap, and you have El Salvador

586
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:33,200
that's just kind of getting their stuff sorted out, I kind of feel like on the all it's going

587
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,120
to end up higher than lower.

588
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,420
And when I say 70,000, I hope I'm I hope it's going to be higher than 70,000.

589
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:44,440
But you know, if you've pinned your hopes on something like that, Bitcoin will disappoint.

590
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,680
Yeah, I think I'll be I'll be the bear today, then and not too much.

591
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,640
But I think we're just gonna see a flat 2020.

592
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:56,200
Probably this time next year, we'll be flirting around 50k just the same that we are now,

593
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,960
you know, maybe a little over maybe a little under, but nothing too far different from

594
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
50k.

595
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,200
I mean, that sounds boring, but reasonable with you know, especially with the altcoins

596
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,760
like Ethereum and others out there that are showing some interesting technical solutions.

597
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,920
I can see the money going from Bitcoin to things like Ethereum or salon and stuff like

598
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
that.

599
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,920
We'll see.

600
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,320
We don't know.

601
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,800
That's why we only talk about it once a year.

602
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,340
Otherwise, it's back to Linux and open source for us starting in January on Thursdays.

603
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,080
So go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe so that way you don't miss a single episode

604
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,080
in the transition.

605
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,040
And linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to keep in touch.

606
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:42,600
And join us on a Sunday now Linux Unplugged will be live over at jblive.tv around 1230

607

As for this show, well, we'll be back Thursday the 6th with our weekly take on the latest

609
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,600
Linux and open source news.
