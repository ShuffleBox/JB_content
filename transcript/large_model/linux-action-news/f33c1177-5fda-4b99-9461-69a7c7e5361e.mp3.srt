00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, Episode 247, recorded on June 29, 2022.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,200
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,200
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,840
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,080
We start this week with the leading edge of the Linux desktop, and some new details about

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,280
what's coming in Fedora 37.

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,520
Yeah, there's a lot here.

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,400
In fact, we're gonna have to link to most of it.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,320
But there's just so many things landing right now because the Fedora Engineering and Steering

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,920
Committee has approved a fresh batch of features for the next version of Fedora.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,920
And there's a lot in here.

13
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,840
But what does jump out at me is just some serious movements around the servers, I guess,

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,080
editions of Fedora, including both the cloud workloads and the CoreOS workloads.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,000
For example, CoreOS may actually get promoted to an official edition this release cycle.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,640
But something that I'm surprised we haven't seen before, but is definitely much needed

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,720
for Fedora in the cloud, we're now going to have a Fedora KVM disk image, which will be

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,400
shipped as part of Fedora 37 Server Edition.

19
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,280
Well, sticking with that server focus for just a moment, a change proposal has now been

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,520
filed for getting Stratus 3.1 into Fedora 37.

21
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,360
The proposal notes, quote, Stratus 3.1.0 includes significant improvements to the management

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,240
of the thin provisioning layers, as well as a number of other user visible enhancements

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,840
and bug fixes.

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,760
So if you are a Stratus user out there, sounds like a release you don't want to miss.

25
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,840
I have a feeling this is one of those LAN episodes that you and I are going to have

26
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,080
like a big to do list afterwards because this is one of those things and we're going to

27
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,940
get to another one in a minute that we're going to have to try.

28
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,960
On the desktop side of things, especially for us x86-64 users, Fedora is now going to

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,480
use GPT partitioning on new installs rather than MBR or MS-DOS for BIOSystems.

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,520
Currently Fedora only uses GPT disk labels on an EFI system.

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,000
And perhaps the biggest news buried in all of this is this new long term effort by Red Hat

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,040
that's recently just begun to address general accessibility issues in Fedora.

33
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,960
Yeah, on June 27, Christian Schaller announced that Red Hat has hired a blind software engineer

34
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:20,120
to lead their efforts in, quote, making sure Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora Workstation

35
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,640
has excellent accessibility support.

36
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,880
And it looks like some of Lucas's first work will be going through applications which reported

37
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,280
to GTK4 as part of the recent GNOME development cycle.

38
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,640
Then it sounds like they plan to expand out from there and get broader and broader.

39
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,560
In the announcement, they also write, quote, what we hope to get from this is not only

40
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,640
a better experience for our users, but also to allow even more talented engineers like

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,520
Lucas to work on Linux and open source software at Red Hat.

42
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,440
We'll have a link to the announcement in the show notes.

43
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,080
And you know, it's really just kind of a great read to get a high level understanding of

44
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,840
the state of accessibility on Linux as it stands right now.

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:09,480
And of course, where we might see improvements in the not too distant future.

46
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,680
Two listener favorites got big updates this week, starting quickly with Firefox 102.

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,640
I mean, there's really nothing too exciting in this release.

48
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,640
There's a few things.

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,240
I mean, I guess maybe you're a big fan of reading PDFs in high contrast mode or you've

50
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,080
been looking forward to improved geolocation support under Linux.

51
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,280
But in general, it's nothing that's going to knock your socks off.

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,380
Well, if that doesn't excite you, maybe Thunderbird 102 should because this one seems like a big

53
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,380
upgrade.

54
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,320
For one, it introduces a new address book implementation, which surely took some work

55
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,280
and maybe the biggest change in this entire release.

56
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,680
But there's also a new import export wizard, a redesigned message header, and a few UI

57
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,120
refinements like new icons and color folders that really pop.

58
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,920
And of course, there's also that matrix chat support, which is probably something we should

59
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,920
be trying.

60
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,440
I was telling you, Wes, this is one of those episodes where we're going to have a to-do

61
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
list.

62
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,880
I mean, I've never thought about matrix in my email client, but I have to admit, I recently

63
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,360
have been thinking about giving Thunderbird a go again, and I would probably try out the

64
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
matrix stuff.

65
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,000
There's some notable UI changes since I last looked at Thunderbird that have landed in

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,580
this release specifically.

67
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,640
There's this new spaces toolbar.

68
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,080
They say it gives you fast and easy access to the most important activities.

69
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,160
So in a single click, you can navigate between mail, your address book, your calendar, your

70
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,820
tasks and your chats, or any of the other add-ons that you've installed.

71
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,200
And the UI looks really slick.

72
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,500
They've done a good job of making it easy to jump through there without taking up a

73
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,400
huge portion of your UI sidebar to actually make it possible.

74
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,660
And we have it on good authority that Thunderbird 102 is just the start of many good things

75
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,660
to come.

76
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,800
We did have a chat with Ryan Sipes recently.

77
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,880
That was an episode 245 of Linux Action News.

78
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,120
Don't miss that.

79
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,720
Speaking of matrix, Synapse admins had to jump to action this week when it was discovered

80
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:12,800
that in some cases, a URL preview could trigger a denial of service attack on a home server.

81
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,600
Just a good old URL preview.

82
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,680
Yeah, it seems like it was possible for this to be used maliciously, either by a user on

83
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,680
the home server, or if a remote user sent a URL, which then a local user of that server

84
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,720
tried to preview automatically with their client, it could then trigger the exploit.

85
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,960
That's kind of the funny thing about it.

86
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,080
Remote users were not actually able to directly trigger the exploit.

87
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,880
But if a local user is in that room, and their client set to preview the URL, guess what?

88
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
It's going to trigger it.

89
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,960
Thankfully, though, the mitigation is pretty easy.

90
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,800
URL previews aren't enabled by default.

91
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:57,200
So if you do have them on, you need to flip that off ASAP, or update to release 1.61.1

92
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,720
or greater.

93
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,600
Not really a huge issue since it's just a denial of service and thankfully not something

94
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
worse.

95
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,720
But we want to make sure the word gets out.

96
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,480
So are you still waiting on your Steam Deck?

97
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,800
Well, we have some good news and some bad news.

98
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,640
Valve tweeted this week saying it has more than doubled the number of Steam Decks being

99
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,480
produced every week.

100
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,960
The company also says it just sent out the last batch of Q2 reservation emails, and is

101
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:30,880
prepared to start kicking off Q3 reservations on the 30th of June.

102
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:38,800
That said, the expected availability date hasn't changed, it still says October 2022

103
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
or later.

104
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,680
But, you know, there is a chance that this date will change with production ramping up,

105
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,680
since, you know, so far it's basically remained the same for months.

106
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,480
All this makes me curious, Chris, have you been checking on your order status?

107
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,800
Of course I did.

108
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Of course.

109
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,480
Nothing's changed.

110
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
Anyone can check.

111
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,080
You can go to store.steampowered.com slash Steam Deck, and then you have to log in with

112
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,080
your Steam ID.

113
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,440
I ordered the 512 gig version, and Steam tells me that my expected order availability is

114
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:21,120
Q3 July through September of 2022, which could be any day as we record, or could be a ways

115
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
away.

116
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,520
But the funny thing is, Wes, as time goes on, honestly, the less I'm excited about it.

117
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,920
I don't know, we'll see what happens first.

118
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,920
I get my Steam Deck, or I lose interest and cancel my pre-order.

119
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:38,600
Stay tuned and find out.

120
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:45,000
Video fans need not apply, because the world's truly best text editor has taken a big step

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,520
with a major new release.

122
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,680
Vim 9.0 has been announced, and besides many small additions, the spotlight this time around

123
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,840
is on a new incarnation of the VimScript language, Vim9Script.

124
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,520
A new incarnation of the VimScript language?

125
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,560
What is this, Emacs?

126
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
What does Vim need this for?

127
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,680
Okay, okay, let's set a little context here.

128
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,160
Vim's been around for a long time, as has its scripting language, and it's basically

129
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,520
preserved backwards compatibility most of that time.

130
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,300
And that means whatever perhaps bad choices from the past that were made, those are still

131
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,600
haunting us today.

132
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,360
Keep in mind, there's also some compatibility with things like legacy VI that are a factor

133
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,800
here.

134
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,600
All of that adds up, and it means that execution is slow.

135
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,640
Doesn't help that each line is parsed and interpreted every time it's executed.

136
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:47,680
So one of the main goals of this new script is to dramatically improve performance.

137
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,160
One way that's accomplished is by compiling commands into bytecode that can be more efficiently

138
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,200
executed, so it doesn't have to be parsed every time.

139
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,680
And that leads to an expected increase in execution speed of something like 10 to 100

140
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,680
times.

141
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,400
Now, besides that great performance improvement, a secondary goal of this whole new script

142
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,400
version is to avoid some Vim-specific oddities, which are definitely there, and get a lot

143
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,160
closer to something more like a programming language developers are already using.

144
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:26,080
You know, something like JavaScript, Python, or Java.

145
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,040
Linode.com slash LAN.

146
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and you go there to support the

147
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
show.

148
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,140
Linode is really the Linux geeks cloud.

149
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,400
With 11 data centers worldwide, they've been working at this for nearly 19 years, and they

150
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,120
have built the best experience for running applications on Linux.

151
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,840
I hear it from listeners all the time.

152
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,080
They're blown away by the performance, the support, and the pricing.

153
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,820
All the things that drew me in.

154
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,000
And if you like to build things yourself, or you like to do things with simple one-click

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
deployments, Linode has infrastructure that's going to work for you.

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,360
Pricing, skill level, they got something to match all of it.

157
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,080
I think once you get in there, you'll be damn impressed by the performance.

158
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,720
It's fricking incredible.

159
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,200
They got their own ISP connections, right?

160
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,240
They don't deal with somebody else.

161
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,720
They are their own ISP.

162
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,120
And with 11 data centers around the world, there's something that's going to work for

163
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,720
you, something that's close to you.

164
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,320
And one of the things I really appreciate is I've been a customer now for over two and

165
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,800
a half years, is Linode is always rolling out better and faster stuff.

166
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:28,440
AMD EPYC processors, NVME-based block storage, physical servers, database as a service, object

167
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
storage expansion.

168
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,560
It has just been something like every month.

169
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,120
Linode's always working on stuff.

170
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,320
And their team is always analyzing what's going on in the world.

171
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,880
In fact, they publish a security digest report that's super useful for anyone in the industry,

172
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,440
even if you're not a Linode customer.

173
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,940
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

174
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,800
It's a good read if you're looking for a snapshot of what you need to know about in the Linux

175
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,960
security world right now.

176
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,280
After you've been using Linode for a minute, if you're like me, I think you'll learn to

177
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,160
appreciate some of the tooling built around it.

178
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,200
They have a really straightforward API, super easy to understand.

179
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,200
There's libraries for like Python and just about everything else out there that you could

180
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,000
plug in with an existing application, or you could use their pre-built CLI application.

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I do that.

182
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,400
It's a great way to interface with their S3 object storage, which is fricking great.

183
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,400
And what really puts things over the top is you can get a hundred dollars and support

184
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,720
the show and then you can go build something.

185
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
You can learn something.

186
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,860
You can try something.

187
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:24,480
See what professional grade services are like from people that have been doing this for

188
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,760
nearly 19 years that really know their stuff.

189
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Go try it.

190
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,760
Go support the show and get a hundred bucks in credit.

191
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:38,640
Linode.com slash LAN.

192
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,000
You might've heard Apple has some shiny new M chips and maybe you were wondering just

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,200
how long it's going to take to get Linux working on them.

194
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,800
Well Hector Martin has been leading the effort to get Linux working on Apple's new SOCs,

195
00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:00,600
held a marathon live development stream this week to kick that bring up process off.

196
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
So yeah.

197
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Hello everyone.

198
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,960
It's been a while.

199
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:12,680
Today I'm going to be bringing up Asahi Linux on the new Apple M2 chip.

200
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,320
And this was quite the stream.

201
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,740
I think it was over 11 hours long.

202
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,540
So yeah, you're going to get to see the whole process.

203
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:25,960
And kind of ironically, even though the stream was over 11 hours long, it only took Hector

204
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,000
about 20 minutes to get Linux booting on the M2.

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yay.

206
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's alive.

207
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Cool.

208
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
All right.

209
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So we're good.

210
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It runs.

211
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That was easy.

212
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
First try.

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And there we go.

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's alive.

215
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You could really tell he was excited.

216
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
He was happy to get that going.

217
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,080
But then he spent the rest of the stream just tweaking things.

218
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,240
And then his chat room joked that they'd gone to bed and woke up to find Hector still hacking

219
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,280
away on the stream.

220
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,160
But of course, there's still more work to be done.

221
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,400
Unfortunately, the keyboard and the trackpad with the new Apple M2 devices will require

222
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,440
a new driver to work properly.

223
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,200
Additionally, SPMI will need a new driver and the PCIe support needs a fuse map in the

224
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,280
mini code to initialize properly.

225
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,080
There's also PMU, Thunderbolt and a bunch of other functionality that's still on the

226
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
growing to do list.

227
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,240
Yeah, that's a lot of stuff.

228
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,840
And of course, there's also that Apple graphic stack.

229
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,200
That's really the elephant in the desktop room right now.

230
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,000
Progress has been made there, though, including we got a triangle drawn on the screen.

231
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,440
But let's be real, there's still just a long ways to go just on the graphic stack.

232
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,120
Yeah, I require at least two triangles from my desktop minimum, please.

233
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,800
I'd say it's safe to say set your expectations to months at best before we have something

234
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,520
like a full featured OpenGL driver or a DRM kernel driver that was suitable for upstreaming

235
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,440
or anything close to those.

236
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,320
Yeah, I'd say that's probably fair.

237
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,000
Maybe we'll be pleasantly surprised, but I'd say months to keep an eye on this and everything

238
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,240
