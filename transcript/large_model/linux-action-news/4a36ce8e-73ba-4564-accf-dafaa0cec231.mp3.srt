00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,460
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,520
This is episode 98, recorded on March 24th, 2019.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,520
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,520
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,520
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,380
Good to be connected with you.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,280
It's a bit of a gaming week, lots of big announcements, and we pulled out a few of

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,860
the Linux related ones for you.

9
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's start with the big service that's been announced that runs on Linux.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,960
Yes, Stadia from Google, which is their cloud gaming service, which was announced to a lot

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,600
of fanfare and a lot of publicity, but we're pretty scant on details apart from the fact

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,400
that it's running Linux on the back end and it's heavily tied into YouTube and you don't

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:57,400
really need a powerful client machine at all because it's all happening on the server end.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,880
In the announcement, Google even talked about using a Chromecast as a possible end device

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:09,440
paired with their custom controller that also connects directly to the cloud and will have

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,000
a Google assistant microphone.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,720
Now they didn't show this on stage, but they claimed that you could be playing a game and

18
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,280
you could ask the Google assistant for help.

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,920
Yeah, and then supposedly YouTube video pops up with how to do that little bit of the level

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,400
or whatever.

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,360
But that microphone, yeah, I don't think I'll be buying one of these controllers somehow.

22
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,040
I love that they've managed to work a microphone into everything, although it's getting more

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
and more common.

24
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,640
My Nvidia Shield has a microphone in it as well because everybody wants to search by

25
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,720
voice, I guess.

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,560
I've never really gotten that because the living room is often a very loud environment.

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,440
One other interesting kind of thing that they've tied in with this is even for systems that

28
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,560
don't support the full 4K 60 frames per second they're claiming, maybe you're on a device

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,200
connected to a 1080p display, when you do a capture, which this controller will have

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,920
a dedicated capture button, when you do this capture it's captured on the remote side in

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,140
full 4K 60 frames a second resolution and then can post that theoretically to YouTube

32
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,080
in full resolution even if the version you're playing is just a 1080p version.

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,160
Yeah, it's all very promising technically.

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,080
I'm very skeptical about this.

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,680
I suppose we'll get on to why it's good for Linux ultimately, but I don't think this is

36
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
going to be very long-lived somehow.

37
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,320
There's been a lot of attempts at this cloud gaming thing and, okay, Google have got the

38
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:38,880
resources to burn like most companies don't, but ultimately it's not going to be very good,

39
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,880
is it?

40
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,480
I mean, yeah, okay, they're making all these promises about low latency and everything,

41
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,040
but you need at least 25 megabits per second down, which, okay, it's not a problem for

42
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,920
me, it's not a problem for you, but for most people in America, they just don't have 25

43
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
down.

44
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,840
And if they do, it's pretty sketchy and with all this net neutrality stuff means that it's

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,680
likely that it'll end up getting throttled and I just don't see it taking off long term

46
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
somehow.

47
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,120
Yeah, not to mention if you're on mobile, the latency of a mobile network will probably

48
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,780
render this unplayable.

49
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,320
There are definitely issues.

50
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,860
However, Google has quite the infrastructure and in the announcement, they dropped a number

51
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:24,180
like 7,500 edge nodes that are close to players to provide the ultimate gaming performance.

52
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,960
So they've thought about this problem from a technical standpoint.

53
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,520
And I kind of have this sense that it's a bit like the early days of YouTube.

54
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,200
Early days of YouTube, nobody had the bandwidth to watch a YouTube video without it buffering.

55
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,540
It played like hell.

56
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,240
It was so bad that Google set up this page where it would try to help you diagnose where

57
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,320
your buffering issues were coming from.

58
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,060
And these days, I never have a problem with YouTube, even on the worst kind of connections.

59
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:53,120
These things get solved over time and this could be Google's attempt to build a YouTube

60
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,200
for gaming.

61
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,160
And I think it's no coincidence that they're tying it in very closely with YouTube in a

62
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,080
pretty brilliant way.

63
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,360
You're sitting there watching a game trailer for say, Assassin's Creed or whatever it might

64
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,420
be and they've got a play now button.

65
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,520
And if you're already subscribed, maybe you're part of this premium package that includes

66
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,980
YouTube and Google Play Music and this gaming service, you click that one button and they

67
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:23,300
claim in some instances, in five seconds, the game's up and running.

68
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:29,000
The other thing that's kind of crazy is you'll be able to share in-state links that load

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,540
the game right at a specific place, like you can with a ROM where you pause the emulator

70
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,000
and then you can resume right at that save state.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,280
You'll be able to send save state links if the game is written for the platform.

72
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,680
Yeah, again, that's pretty impressive.

73
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,740
And I remember when you guys talked about Google Cloud on TechSnap, the big standout

74
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,920
feature of it is that the various data centers that they have communicate directly with each

75
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,440
other, not over the public internet.

76
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,280
And so that means that in theory, you're going to get way better performance than these competitors

77
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,640
who've tried and failed at this.

78
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,000
So I think if anyone can do it, Google can, but I just don't think that anyone can do

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
it somehow.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,200
But I think that they'll probably give it a go for a couple of years.

81
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,840
And in that couple of years, it's going to be great for Linux gaming because this thing's

82
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,880
running on Linux, right?

83
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:22,400
So they're going to push forward the whole Linux gaming situation and development and

84
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,480
everyone is potentially going to benefit from the work that they do there.

85
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,020
This is an area where we need a lot more details.

86
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:32,160
Up on stage, big graphic, Linux, Vulkan.

87
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,160
If you want to write your game to our platform, target it for Linux and use Vulkan.

88
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,480
Wow, my mind was blown when I saw that because think about the possibilities there, right?

89
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,160
Because then it really is just a few more steps to publish it online, put it in Steam,

90
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,920
whatever it might be.

91
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,320
And there are advantages to specifically writing to Google's platform that could never be delivered

92
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,280
in a console or in a desktop PC.

93
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,760
And they don't go into a lot of details, but they say there is the ability to access more

94
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:09,360
GPUs, perhaps lots of GPUs and specific systems that are designed to render physics and the

95
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,600
ability to place thousands of cameras in various different places inside the game.

96
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,820
You can also reskin game objects in real time with machine generated images if you write

97
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,000
for their platform.

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,640
So there are a lot of advantages to targeting Stadia if the platform does get some traction.

99
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,460
I'm not as convinced they're going to kill this one quickly.

100
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,240
They have been building to this with a beta now for a little while laying the foundation

101
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,620
of a data center network of these devices.

102
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:41,480
They've hired on a big shot VP to run it.

103
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,120
I feel like this is something they've been investing in in the background for years now.

104
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,480
So if they kill this thing, it's going to be quite a while before they do because of

105
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,760
just the massive investment.

106
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,680
Well, should we talk about this on Google Plus with each other or Allo or Buzz or Wave?

107
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
I actually have...

108
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Yeah, that's what I was going to say.

109
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:06,560
Have a great Wave doc going with real time editing, you'll love it.

110
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,280
Just look at killedbygoogle.com for the list, the long, long list of services that they've

111
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,640
killed and hardware and stuff like that.

112
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:21,920
I just find it very difficult to invest in a service that comes from Google unless it's

113
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,600
one of their real core platforms like Gmail and search.

114
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,920
And there's also the privacy implications here.

115
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:35,480
There is a lot of baggage tied up when you sign up for another Google service.

116
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:42,420
When you commit yourself further to the Google ecosystem, there is a price to pay in a sense.

117
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,920
It's not a monetary price, but there is a price.

118
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,640
And that, unfortunately, is not so easily solvable.

119
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,760
It's something that everybody has to make their own decision on.

120
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,000
Well, something that we've been talking about kind of off air is this idea of what it takes

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,840
for certain areas of Linux to be pushed forward.

122
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,240
And it's basically always money.

123
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,360
And that's why development tools are amazing on Linux, because they make people money.

124
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,840
And maybe this could be what makes gaming get pushed forward, because there's money

125
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,520
to be made suddenly gaming on Linux.

126
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,680
Yeah, we've just turned gaming into a server side application.

127
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
Yeah, exactly.

128
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,960
Which is really Linux's sweet spot.

129
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:29,840
And in a way, it could mean that you're playing a Linux game on a Linux box, but it's streamed

130
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,360
to that Linux box.

131
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,240
So it sort of opens up a lot more games to Linux users.

132
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,960
And it's using Linux to render that game.

133
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:43,200
But it's coming back to you in a proprietary video stream that's probably wrapped up in

134
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
DRM.

135
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,100
So there's pluses and minuses.

136
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,360
It means you can game without crazy graphics and you could use free open source drivers

137
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,160
for your entire machine.

138
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,280
It also means you're probably getting an H.264 DRM video stream or something like it.

139
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
Yeah, maybe.

140
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,520
But I'm just really hoping that all this Vulkan backend stuff that they're going to be working

141
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,280
on to make this even better will filter down to the rest of us.

142
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:12,740
And those of us who want to play games locally and not connect to the cloud will benefit

143
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,740
from it.

144
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,440
It is just too early to say, but I'm crossing my fingers on it.

145
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,680
I'm going to remain optimistic.

146
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,440
Well, if Google running Linux games on servers doesn't save Linux gaming, then maybe Open

147
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,520
XR will, or at least virtual reality that's using Linux initially.

148
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
It's kind of complicated.

149
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,200
Well, as with any new standard, we all benefit when it's open.

150
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:41,120
And this week, we learned about Open XR, which is a new standard from Khronos, which is totally

151
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:50,080
open and pulls together, potentially at least, all AR and VR headsets and gives developers

152
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,880
one thing to target rather than all these fragmented platforms.

153
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Right.

154
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,520
It kind of reminds me a little bit of the early days of getting 3D games working on

155
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,800
computers where you had all these different video cards and standards, and then the industry

156
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,160
kind of coalesced around a couple of standards.

157
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,900
This is going to be one of those.

158
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,480
Like Joe said, it's from the Khronos group, which is the folks behind Vulkan, and that's

159
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,080
been pretty successful.

160
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,440
And there's already an open source Linux tie-in to this.

161
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,860
So as a developer, you need a way to try out this Open XR runtime and make sure that you're

162
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,940
communicating with the devices, because part of what Open XR does is it abstracts the controllers.

163
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,720
So instead of saying right controller click, you can say grab item, things like that.

164
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
But you need a way to program for that.

165
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:41,200
So the folks at Collabra have developed Monado, which is a fully open source Open XR runtime

166
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
on Linux.

167
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,920
So yeah, that's the Linux tie-in here is gaming developers will be building Linux boxes running

168
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,000
this runtime to develop for this new standard, which is supposedly going to unify all the

169
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,600
VR headsets.

170
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,900
And some big names are in on it, to be fair, Microsoft being one of the bigger ones and

171
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,240
actually is actively promoting it on their Twitter.

172
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,500
But HTC, a lot of the mobile vendors that are trying to make phone VR in Valve, Unity's

173
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
in there.

174
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,040
So it's got some industry support.

175
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,400
It could actually take off, plus you figure with the Khronos folks behind it, it's got

176
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,240
a good shot.

177
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,760
Maybe finally, VR will be the big hit, Joe.

178
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,080
Well, surprise, surprise, I'm going to be a little bit skeptical about whether it will

179
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,080
take off.

180
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,740
But I think if it has any chance of taking off, this is how it will happen.

181
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,320
You need to have the open standard to attract the developers and therefore get the users.

182
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,760
And although only a couple of headsets are supported right now, the idea and the hope

183
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:43,120
is that new ones that come out will be supported by this and even existing ones will eventually

184
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
be supported.

185
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,560
So as I said, if there's any chance of it happening, this is it.

186
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,080
But I'm still somewhat skeptical.

187
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,080
I'm half skeptical.

188
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:57,560
You see, I don't think it's necessarily going to mean much for the end users, at least Linux

189
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
end users.

190
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,640
But I do think there's a really interesting similarity between the Google announcements

191
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,640
and this Khronos Group announcement.

192
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:12,480
And the intrinsic message in both of those announcements to the developers is go use

193
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,120
Linux.

194
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,800
If you want to build for our platform, go use Linux.

195
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,980
If you want to start building now for this new open standard for VR, go use Linux.

196
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:27,860
And I think it underscores why we need to have on the Linux side the best desktop for

197
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,680
developers out there, out of any operating system.

198
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,560
Better than Mac OS, better than Windows, and I think we're pretty much there.

199
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,320
But there's some rough edges, and there's probably going to be more and more different

200
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,560
use cases as more huge companies and groups say, go use Linux.

201
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,000
So it's going to be a process.

202
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,920
But that particular theme between these two announcements, I'm kind of excited about.

203
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,280
Because developers are a great crowd, and the more of them that come over to Linux,

204
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,960
I think the stronger, the better our desktop will be.

205
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,240
And I think they're also a good group to help us work out some of those rough edges that

206
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
might still exist.

207
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,080
So you're saying that we need to have a great Linux desktop, a great experience for developers.

208
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,160
Well, I can do you one better than that.

209
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,560
I can do you 10 better than that.

210
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,620
We've got 10 of them.

211
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,620
You can have Plasma.

212
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,620
You can have GNOME.

213
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,620
XFCE for you.

214
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,160
XFCE for all the developers.

215
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,160
Yeah, talk about fragmentation.

216
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,160
But I don't know.

217
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,760
It's all choice and stuff.

218
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,200
But I think realistically, GNOME is like the main one, isn't it?

219
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,040
If you look at the main distros.

220
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,680
And that is improving.

221
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,280
As we talked about recently, the latest release of that is just massively improved.

222
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,320
And the latest release of Ubuntu that we're getting in a few weeks is going to have tons

223
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,900
of performance improvements.

224
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,720
So hopefully, as these devs get attracted over to the platform, they will have a first

225
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,500
class experience and will grow the community.

226
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,360
There's another story this week that I thought was a bit interesting.

227
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,140
And it's out of Intel.

228
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:54,540
They're working on a driver for a graphics card that we likely would never run, but massive

229
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,400
like super 500 top 100 computers will run.

230
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,940
And I think it's interesting watching how they are working upstream to integrate this

231
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,160
driver into the Linux source code.

232
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,060
Yeah, this is the new Intel XE graphics.

233
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,760
I think that's how you say it, which don't actually exist yet.

234
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,280
We've kind of been hearing about this for a long time, their discrete graphics cards.

235
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:23,960
And it looks as if there's going to be a distinction between the kind of GPUs that go in these

236
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:29,000
supercomputers versus the PCIe cards that we're going to get.

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,760
But it is interesting to see that they are very much concentrating on Linux.

238
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,480
I mean, I suppose they'd have to really, and Intel have got a reasonably good track record

239
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,120
when it comes to drivers, although not necessarily with updating them, but they seem to be getting

240
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,680
better with that.

241
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,520
But it looks as if we're going to get a serious third player in the GPU market, which has

242
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
got to be good for everyone.

243
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:56,480
Yeah, I mean, these rumors suggest the XE graphics will have discrete memory for the

244
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
GPUs.

245
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,760
So no longer integrated memory, which would be a big performance boost.

246
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,480
And if Intel is building these to go after the supercomputer market, they're really building

247
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,520
these to compete with Nvidia, because Nvidia is competing very strongly there right now.

248
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,200
And that's one of the reasons they've been dedicated to the Linux driver.

249
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
And this could be good for everybody.

250
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,600
A little bit of competition might make everybody's drivers a little bit better.

251
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:22,720
Well, I'm really hoping that Intel decides to stand out against Nvidia with these XE

252
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,960
GPUs by actually having totally free software drivers that work really, really well, and

253
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,960
we don't need to have blobs.

254
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,920
I'm fairly hopeful for that, because it would be a real competitive advantage and would

255
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,160
encourage people to buy these cards, which are obviously new to the market.

256
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,900
So fingers crossed that this is excellent news for Linux.

257
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,000
The KDE Connect project got some bad news from Google this week, and then later on got

258
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
some good news.

259
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,760
It started out with the project being removed from the Google Play Store for violating their

260
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,820
new policy on apps that access your SMS messages.

261
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,820
That was pretty upsetting.

262
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,840
Of course, everybody said, hey, F-Droid's a thing.

263
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,160
It's still an F-Droid, everybody.

264
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,000
And so F-Droid, I think, picked up a few new users from the bad news.

265
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,960
Yeah, that was the silver lining of this.

266
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,220
But the reality is that almost everybody uses the Play Store to install apps, because if

267
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,460
you want to use F-Droid, you have to go and allow untrusted sources and unknown sources,

268
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:20,400
and that's quite scary for a lot of users.

269
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,280
So it's good that it only took a couple of days and it's back in the Play Store.

270
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:31,120
It did briefly reappear with the SMS functionality taken out of it, which is a big part of KDE

271
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
Connect.

272
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:37,200
So it was good to see that they sorted things out, and now it's back up in the Play Store

273
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
fully functional.

274
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,320
I completely agree.

275
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:45,960
And for some context, Google did warn developers back on October 8, 2018, that as part of their

276
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:51,520
developer policy updates that were impending, they would be limiting what apps were allowed

277
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,960
to access your SMS.

278
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,780
Essentially, if it wasn't your default SMS application, it had to have a damn good reason,

279
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:01,440
and they had to get permission from Google to get access to your SMS to make it more

280
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,120
in line with how iOS works, after certain companies like Facebook were found just whole

281
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,480
hog reading your SMS messages and sending them back up to servers.

282
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,640
Yeah, ultimately, Google are trying to do the right thing here, because security has

283
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,160
been a bit lax on Android, specifically compared with iOS.

284
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,680
So you can understand why they're trying to do this, but it just seems like they've been

285
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,800
a bit heavy-handed with it, and it's not worked out exactly how they wanted it to, and it's

286
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:35,200
kind of bad publicity for them when you've got a great free software project like KDE

287
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,720
having issues with them.

288
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,040
It was a very popular Twitter thread about it, and it has kind of really shone Google

289
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,560
in a bit of a bad light when I think they were trying to do a good thing, really.

290
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,560
Yeah, but I think that led to Google noticing a little bit quicker than they might have

291
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,960
for the average bear, and he isn't the only developer that's run into these issues.

292
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,880
There's been other developers that have been complaining about this, so I think Google

293
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,160
is a little more incentivized to respond quickly right now.

294
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,640
I mean, they've got a lot on their plate, Joe.

295
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:08,640
They do have a lot on their plate, specifically with the EU, who have forced them into doing

296
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,280
a browser choice on Android.

297
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,880
So this seems a bit familiar, doesn't it?

298
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,600
More and more these days, Google reminds me of an old, younger Microsoft.

299
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,200
Now Google puts it on their blog, we're going to do more to ensure that Android phone owners

300
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,000
know about the wide choice of browser and search engines available to download on their

301
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,240
phones.

302
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,880
This will involve asking users of existing and new Android devices in Europe which browser

303
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,120
and search apps they'd like to use.

304
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,120
It's funny how Google tried to spin it as a really good thing for the consumer and everything,

305
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,860
but it doesn't take much to hear the gritted teeth through which they wrote that.

306
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,560
And the fact that it's only in the EU means they were obviously forced to do it.

307
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,840
And I don't know why they're pretending otherwise, really.

308
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,760
Well, at this point, they're probably just trying to avoid more fines.

309
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:04,900
In fact, I believe the European Commission just fined them another $1.49 billion for

310
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,840
ad market monopoly practices.

311
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,800
In fact, if you look at Google's numbers now, they're paying more in European Commission

312
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,320
fines than they are taxes.

313
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,280
Yeah, so this is starting to be more than pocket change to them.

314
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,080
I mean, obviously they pay as little tax as possible, like all the giant corporations.

315
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,160
But still, this must be really starting to register with them now that they just can't

316
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,480
get away with this stuff.

317
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:34,240
And the EU and the European Commission are just not going to stand for monopolistic practices.

318
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,860
I mean, it does seem a bit hypocritical to not force Apple to have a browser choice because

319
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,640
you buy an iPhone and that's got Safari, right?

320
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,760
I mean, okay, fair enough, their business model isn't based on your search history and

321
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,360
advertising and everything, but it's still somewhat hypocritical.

322
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,240
It really does seem though to be like the trifecta that really gets them.

323
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:00,480
It's the fact that it's their platform that they're charging OEMs for, it's their browser,

324
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,200
and they're the leader in online advertising slash search.

325
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,840
And those things seem to be what keep getting them on the radar.

326
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,120
And they did some investigations showing that in March of 2009, Google began rolling out

327
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,540
these exclusive contracts and clauses for premium placement of Google ads.

328
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:24,920
They cite that as an example of Google pressing competitors down on the page into less valuable

329
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
space.

330
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:31,120
They say that in 2006, Google had exclusive clauses in certain contracts for providing

331
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,680
search advertising to publishers and they had to only use Google search.

332
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,860
And they say that's another example where Google prevented competitors from coming in

333
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,920
and having a fair shot and that they were able to leverage their market position to

334
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,940
get these contracts and these exclusive agreements or terms of service.

335
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,240
You combine that with their 80% or whatever it is Android market share and now Chrome's

336
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,700
dominance and Google search's dominance, I think I could see their case here.

337
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:06,020
I don't know if I really feel like Google did anything evil to get in these positions.

338
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,420
I think they've made pretty competitive products and the market has responded or they made

339
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,840
it at least free in some cases and the market responded to that.

340
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,960
And now that Google's made it to the top, it kind of feels like they're getting smacked

341
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,280
down and getting charged and nickeled and dimed.

342
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,960
But of course, that's just my Yankee capitalism perspective.

343
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,480
Well, that's the thing about capitalism, right?

344
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,520
It was their duty to their shareholders to make as much money as they possibly can.

345
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,240
They're sort of legally obliged to do so.

346
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,920
And so it's a very fine line that they have to tread here between making as much money

347
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:42,960
as they can by essentially being anti-competitive with not getting slapped with huge fines,

348
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,120
which impact their bottom line.

349
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,000
They are large fines, you're right.

350
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,320
But they're doing fine.

351
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:55,880
I mean, you're talking this last one was 1 billion in 2017, it was 5.1 billion.

352
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,920
It looks like Google is projecting another 50 million they have set aside for 2019.

353
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,540
They now just have this broken out in their accounting.

354
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,620
They have these, they do, yeah, they just have these commission fines broken out as

355
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,540
part of their business operating costs.

356
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,920
But they are a rich company.

357
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:16,980
I believe they had an annual revenue last year of $136.8 billion.

358
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:23,200
So 5 billion Hertz for sure, and another billion, that's not great, but they're doing okay.

359
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Yeah.

360
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,600
So the rest of us have like, you know, gas money, internet, you know, electricity, whatever.

361
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,200
They've got European Commission fines, that's budgeted out.

362
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,960
That's the life of these companies, I guess.

363
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,560
It's hard when, you know, you're doing business in these multiple domains now, and they're

364
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,400
getting into more, like with video streaming and now game streaming.

365
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,200
They're essentially becoming, they're becoming a gaming company.

366
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,920
They're already a television company.

367
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,960
And Amazon and Apple and Microsoft and others are all trying to do the same thing.

368
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,040
So these European Commissioners are going to be busy for a long time.

369
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,480
Yeah, it's just a shame that I won't be seeing any of that money in the UK.

370
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,600
Oh, sore subject, I know.

371
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,500
Well, this has been a pretty gaming heavy week because of the big gaming expo that just

372
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:14,160
wrapped up, but every single week we are covering Linux and open source news right here on Linux

373
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160

376
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,600
Our Linux Fest Northwest community is growing.

377
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,800
We have a telegram group set up, jupyterbroadcasting.com slash Linux Fest.

378
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,440
We're going to give away some retro stickers.

379
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,440
I say retro because pretty soon you're going to see some slick new logos rolling out for

380
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,320
our Jupiter Broadcasting shows.

381
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,240
So we figured we might as well do something with the stickers, right?

382
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,240
So we're going to give them away.

383
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,760
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Linux Fest if you want to join that thread and contribute

384
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,240
positively to the conversation and maybe we'll use it for future fests as well.

385
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:52,720
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

386
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,480
