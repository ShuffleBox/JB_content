00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,140
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 197, recorded on July 11th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,140
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,140
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,140
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,140
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,940
During a virtual presentation streamed to the public, the Nextcloud team announced Nextcloud

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,780
Hub 22, the second major launch this year.

8
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,140
During the presentation, CEO and founder Frank Karliczek made the case that Nextcloud solves

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,200
complicated cloud privacy and legal issues in an ideal way.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,080
But this is exactly what we want to solve with Nextcloud.

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,320
So Nextcloud is the only solution that provides you with all these collaboration communication

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,560
features that we need, like in our world, as it is today, and it will be in the future

13
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,480
after the pandemic.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:55,200
But we provide the security, we make everything GDPR compliant, there is no vendor login,

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,120
we don't sell any data to advertisers, obviously.

16
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,720
So in our opinion, Nextcloud is actually the solution for this post-pandemic world, but

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,700
in a good way, respecting privacy and security of the users.

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,600
And of course, the stream focused on the release of Hub 22 and its many new features.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,040
Circles is one of the features that caught our attention.

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,540
If you live in the Nextcloud ecosystem, they enable powerful tools to help curate the information

21
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,620
you see coming in and define for the users who they can work with, because they are user

22
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,880
defined groups that make it easier to manage those teams and make it simpler to define

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,520
who you can share files with or assign tasks to, and of course, create chat rooms with.

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,420
Hub 22 makes the integrated chat and task workflows even more helpful, letting you easily

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,560
share project decks into a chat room or quickly turn a chat message into a task.

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,600
They're also integrating with several document signature backends, making it easy to sign

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,400
documents right inside Nextcloud.

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,120
That does sound nice, and indeed, there are also some improvements that landed for Nextcloud

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,840
Mail, features like improved threading, email tagging, and support for C filtering.

30
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,040
There's also Collectives, which looks like something I'd like to play more with.

31
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,800
You can kind of think of Collectives as a knowledge base with management tools built

32
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,280
into Nextcloud.

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,960
Collectives has full-text search, document embedding, and access to knowledge is managed

34
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,720
with user defined groups through Circles, tying it all together.

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,320
I'm seeing Circles everywhere in this release, Wes. More and more though, I think what Nextcloud

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:29,120
is doing here is really building organizational glue, and they're building a compelling group

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,960
of collaboration tools that give you an environment where it all connects together.

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,840
A company like Jupyter Broadcasting that really hasn't sunk super deep into some Office 365

39
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,920
or super deep into Google Apps, I kind of find this appealing because we need a little

40
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,760
bit of project management. We need a chat interface. It could replace several tools.

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,260
It's taken a lot of releases for these collaboration tools to kind of all come together as they

42
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,280
have now in Hub 22. But in listening to their stream and looking at the features of this

43
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,640
release, it seems to me that the work from home move last year seems to have given the

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,360
Nextcloud team a whole new set of momentum.

45
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,120
Well, from creating things to destroying things, a lot happened this week in the open source

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,200
world. We told you we would keep an eye on the Audacity fork situation, and this week

47
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,840
it appears the fork hype slowed its roll a bit when the maintainer of one of the more

48
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:26,080
popular forks stepped down over claims of physical harassment.

49
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,880
The trouble began when the quintessential free software audio editor changed ownership

50
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:37,600
hands back in May. Days after that oddly handled acquisition announcement, the company proposed

51
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,840
telemetry be added to the project and announced the enforcement of a contributor license agreement.

52
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,960
While the company seemed to listen and respond to feedback, many were still shocked by the

53
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:56,700
initial overreaches. Then came changes to the privacy agreement, which excluded users

54
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:03,920
under the age of 13, a perhaps questionable move possibly even running afoul of the GPL.

55
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,000
And the response to all of these moves were entirely predictable. The project was forked

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,680
multiple times since these announcements. Audacity's Flatpak maintainer quickly jumped

57
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,000
into action and blocked the Flatpak version's network access. Even though the telemetry

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,480
hadn't even been added to Audacity yet, at least in the shipping version, the Flatpak

59
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,160
maintainer wanted to ensure that users were going to be protected, so he just shut it

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,920
off. And since the latest round of, well, frankly easily preventable public blunders

61
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,360
by the Muse group, the Audacity project has been forked more than 50 times, including

62
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,400
the Tenacity project.

63
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,600
Accused by the GitHub user known as Cookie Engineer, it's this fork that attracted the

64
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,200
attention of 4chan, resulting in what Cookie Engineer claims is real-world harassment and

65
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,600
thus his abandoning of the project.

66
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah, okay, so the whole thing, what started all this alleged harassment, was a disagreement

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,280
over the new project's name. Yep. So of course they couldn't use Audacity, right? That's

68
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,080
owned by the Muse group now, so Cookie Engineer ran a poll to find a new name. Well, 4chan

69
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,520
caught wind of this poll and thought it would be hilarious to ensure that Sneedacity, a

70
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,640
reference to the Simpsons, won that poll.

71
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,760
Then when Cookie Engineer deleted the poll and picked Tenacity as the new name, well,

72
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,080
that didn't go over well. The initial response from 4chan members, though, seemed rather

73
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,280
reasonable, actually. They just forked the Audacity project themselves and named it Sneedacity.

74
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
All right.

75
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,920
Yeah, but things didn't stay there, Wes. Things could not just be left alone. The two forks

76
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,360
could not live on in their own in peace. Now there is no way for Wes and I to verify these

77
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,080
claims, but still, Cookie Engineer claims that 4chan members took things considerably

78
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,000
further by including physical harassment with a butterfly knife, which, if true, would be

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,080
considered an illegal weapon in Germany. And after that incident, the developer took to

80
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,480
GitHub and announced that he was stepping down from the project.

81
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,640
While a search of the forum shows no evidence of Cookie Engineer's address being shared,

82
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,520
nor calls for physical violence, there were several calls for action to see him banned

83
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,720
from GitHub. Also of note, the 4chaner responsible for creating Sneedacity seems to have been

84
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,440
targeted as well.

85
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,520
As for the Tenacity project, it will likely appoint a new maintainer should anyone still

86
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
want the job.

87
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,840
Yeah, it's a hard job in multiple, multiple ways. So things are going to take a little

88
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,120
while to shake out. And if you're looking for an alternative to Audacity right now,

89
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,960
well, then I recommend you check out Osen Audio for a fantastic single track audio editor,

90
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,120
a real gem out there. And then, of course, there is our favorite audio editor of all

91
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,840
time, and that's Reaper, which works great on Linux. And they even make a version that

92
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,760
would run on the Raspberry Pi.

93
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:56,440
And of course, an honorable mention for the Ardour project, a feature rich and open source

94
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,960
digital audio workstation.

95
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,840
Another entirely predictable story, but one we've all been dreading, is this week the

96
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,000
news broke, depending on how you measure it, that Microsoft Edge has beat Firefox to become

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,800
the third most popular browser in the world. In recent months, the pair have been neck

98
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,840
and neck, but Microsoft's browser has now pulled ahead in what seems to be a clear lead.

99
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:25,680
Figures for June suggest Microsoft Edge now holds 3.4% of the browser market, while Firefox

100
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,360
has slipped to 3.29, continuing a downward trajectory that has seen the browser either

101
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:41,240
lose or just maintain market share in 10 out of the last 12 months. The trend, unfortunately,

102
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,760
seems clear.

103
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,800
This recent change pushes Edge into the third position in the browser rankings, behind only

104
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:56,560
Chrome at a lofty 65% and then Safari at 18%. Things have definitely been picking up momentum

105
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,720
for Edge since last summer, the browser's market share has more than tripled. Now marketing

106
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,720
obviously plays some role in the increased adoption, and that's the angle that Microsoft

107
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,920
is really going to lean into for this story. But I can't help but just notice that it was

108
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,400
last month that Microsoft began rolling out Edge to all Windows PCs via Windows Update.

109
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:20,880
That had to expand the install base likely by millions almost overnight, which I think

110
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,680
is why you are now seeing Edge push ahead in the numbers this month.

111
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,240
Now you've definitely got it on your machine, and beyond that, Microsoft is doing everything

112
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,140
in its power to encourage users to actually abandon the old Internet Explorer in favor

113
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:41,960
of this new Edge, going so far as removing support for Microsoft 365 web apps and automatically

114
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:48,080
launching certain pages in the new browser. And of course, Safari is the default browser

115
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,160
on iOS, which is clearly pretty hard to compete against.

116
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,400
One can't help but feel like it was kind of naturally just going to shake out like this.

117
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,320
When these big platform owners are exerting the leverage of their big platforms to drive

118
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,120
user adoption to their browsers, how could an independent browser like Firefox even hope

119
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:24,920
to compete?

120
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,480
Linode.com slash LAN. Linode started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing,

121
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,880
three years before AWS and other enterprise providers. And when you go to Linode.com slash

122
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,000

Linux.ting.com. If you're sick of overpaying for your sales service, go see how much you

146
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:43,560
could save and then get $25 off at linux.ting.com. Ting can help you save money because they're

147
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,680
an MBNO or a mobile virtual network operator. That means Ting mobile customers get the same

148
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:54,640
access as customers of the big guys, but with better customer service at a much lower cost.

149
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,320
With Ting mobile, you get the same coast to coast coverage you might with say, the big

150
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,400
networks you're familiar with, but you just pay less. And Ting's plans are simple and

151
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,660
straightforward, like their new set 12 plan, which gives you 12 gigabytes of data with

152
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:13,480
unlimited talk and text for $35 a month. And you know a good family plan is hard to find.

153
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,000
Now they have plans that address this. You add as many lines as you like. It's just 10

154
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,480
bucks a line and every line has unlimited text and calls. How trouble free is that?

155
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,200
And then you share a pool of data and it doesn't really matter how much you want. You can pick

156
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,520
the right plan for you that works. Two, 20, a lot more. There's going to be something

157
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:36,320
that matches up with you. And every Ting plan comes with their award winning customer service

158
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,280
with nationwide LT and 5g coverage and the freedom of no contract ever. It's simple to

159
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,160
switch to Ting. Pretty much any phone will work with Ting because of that network support.

160
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,600
So just head over to linux.ting.com. Check your current phone out, create an account,

161
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,920
pick the plan that's right for you. And then Ting will send you a SIM card. You pop that

162
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,700
in your phone and you get activated in minutes. Cutting your phone bill in half has never

163
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,920
been easier with Ting's great new plans. It's the next generation of Ting mobile. It's here.

164
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:13,080
Go see how much you could save and then take $25 off. Linux.ting.com. Thanks to Ting for

165
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,840
supporting Linux Action News. And thanks to everybody who makes it possible for us to

166
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:23,880
give these shows away for free by visiting linux.ting.com.

167
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:30,760
And now for a few stories from our kernel corner. Starting with Fedora's kernel 5.13

168
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:39,180
test week, which is happening right now. Sunday, July 11 through Sunday, July 18, 2021. Refer

169
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:43,640
to the wiki page we have linked in the show notes for links to the test images you'll

170
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,160
need to participate.

171
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,600
Content production pros have been watching this next feature with a lot of interest.

172
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,520
It's low latency USB audio and it looks to be in pretty good shape to land in kernel

173
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,140
5.14 thanks to some hard work by a subsystem maintainer from SUSE. The goal is to reduce

174
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,980
the latency of USB audio during audio playback. These improvements have been successfully

175
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:12,000
tested with PulseAudio, Jack, Pipewire, and other userspace software. Now the work to

176
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,480
reduce this latency was sent in last week along with some other patches. But Linus Torvalds

177
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:21,400
ended up discovering that work hung one of his systems, so he reverted the problematic

178
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,940
code. But the developers have submitted new patches as of Friday. They seem to have those

179
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:32,220
fixes in there along with the work to reduce that latency in the USB audio driver. So far,

180
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,640
the pull request has landed without any comments by Linus and it appears to be in good shape

181
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,820
to ship this time around.

182
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:45,220
The Rust for the Linux Kernel project, sponsored by Google, is moving right along. A new set

183
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,500
of patches submitted to the kernel mailing list summarizes the progress of the project,

184
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:57,920
which aims to enable Rust to be used alongside C. And that progress is significant. Both

185
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:05,180
the ARM and RISC-V architectures are now supported, and Microsoft's Linux Systems Group hopes

186
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:12,740
to submit some select Hyper-V drivers written in Rust. Speaking of ARM, they're committing

187
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,660
to help the Rust for Linux project on ARM-based systems, and IBM has also contributed some

188
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:25,280
support for the PowerPC architecture. And to top things off, there's a new conference

189
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:32,780
in the works to focus on Rust and the Linux Kernel. More details on that in the future.

190
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,160
And finally in the kernel corner, the news you've all been waiting for. Samsung has posted

191
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,620
patches for a Samba server built into the Linux Kernel. This is the fifth round of these

192
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:47,180
patches for KSMBD, which used to be known as SysD. And the entire idea is a crazy fast

193
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,860
Samba server implemented in the kernel as an SMB3 compliant server. And while that's

194
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,420
theoretically interesting, something tells me we're never going to see these 32,000 lines

195
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,740
of code get mainlined by Linus. But we'll keep an eye on it.

196
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:11,440
Back in December, in Linux Action News 168, we informed you about Google acquiring Neverware,

197
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,540
the company behind a Chromium OS fork called CloudReady, which was targeted at regular

198
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:24,740
PC hardware and users looking for a Windows alternative. One thing CloudReady's live environment

199
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:32,420
had that Chrome OS does not was a nice graphical installer with a simple-to-find install OS

200
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,420
icon.

201
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:39,260
Now a recent commit adds a more streamlined installation and icon to Chromium OS proper

202
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:44,020
upstream. And maybe that's kind of to be expected, but to me the real story here seems clear

203
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:49,220
that Google is preparing Chrome OS for a wider adoption on general PCs.

204
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:55,060
That might also explain some of those native Steam on Chrome OS rumors we've been covering.

205
00:16:55,060 --> 00:17:02,260
Indeed. I wonder how that plays out. So if Chrome OS goes mainstream, let's say, makes

206
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:07,140
it easy to install, easy to find, easy to download, super simple, and it installs on

207
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,620
just about any PC the Linux kernel supports, how does that impact the Linux distribution

208
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,620
market?

209
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:18,700
And new Linux user adoption? I don't know. I mean, it's kind of hard to say at the moment,

210
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:24,100
but it will be fascinating to watch Chrome OS try to compete head-to-head both with our

211
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:30,940
beloved desktop Linux and its other commercial operating system, Breathrend. In some ways,

212
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,160
though, this might be a cleaner fight than what we've got now with all the subsidized

213
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
hardware.

214
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,260
Yeah, fascinating indeed. I think it's interesting to watch Google build all of these irons in

215
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,860
the fire, if you will. They have a lot of things that are coming down the pipe that

216
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,860
are going to be pretty impactful to Linux. And we're going to keep track of all of it

217
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,780
and let you know what happens. So go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new
