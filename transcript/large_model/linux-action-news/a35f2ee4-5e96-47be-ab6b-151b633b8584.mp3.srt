00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,480
This is episode 27, recorded on November 12th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,480
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,480
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,480
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,040
It's good to be connected with you again.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,400
And as we're recording this particular episode, Bitcoin is on a bit of a nosedive.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,880
Yeah, which is a bit surprising to me, because I thought it would rally after this SegWit

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,680
2x fork was called off.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,080
Yeah, we talked about this fork a couple of weeks ago on the show.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,640
And it was that big idea of increasing the size of the individual blockchain storage

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
to two megabytes.

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,760
Yeah, it was kind of a compromise between original Bitcoin and Bitcoin gold.

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,280
And it was looking like it was definitely going to happen.

15
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,640
And then at the last minute, they called it off.

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,120
And so I don't understand why the price has dropped, really, because I thought that yet

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,160
more fragmentation in Bitcoin would have been bad for the market.

18
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
I agree.

19
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,780
It's kind of odd, too, since the official reason for calling it off was to decrease

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:17,360
potential user confusion in the next several weeks, and to keep people focused on mainline

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
Bitcoin.

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,080
So now we're seeing a big drop.

23
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,720
And I've been watching the Twitters, and a few people I follow that are involved in Bitcoin

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,100
and blockchain development projects.

25
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,000
And they're saying that there was a huge reduction in processing power on the Bitcoin network

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,280
last night as well.

27
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,280
And as a result, transaction fees with the sale off happening and reduction in processing

28
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:44,640
power, transaction fees are up near $40 right now per transaction, as we record this episode.

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,320
Which is basically the crux of this whole potential fork, isn't it?

30
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,800
That because the size is so small of each block, it is getting increasingly expensive

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,620
to pay the transaction fees.

32
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,720
So it's inevitable that they're going to have to raise that block size at some stage, you

33
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
would have thought.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
Yeah.

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,480
And in the announcement, it kind of implies this problem isn't going away.

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,320
And maybe we'll all be a little more motivated in the future to solve it.

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,620
And right now, I'm feeling a little motivated to solve it, because I couldn't imagine trying

38
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,080
to buy goods right now with transaction fees that high.

39
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,700
You can't use it for buying and selling goods.

40
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,960
You can use it to trade the currency.

41
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,960
But with fees that high, it's almost impossible to buy anything with the online window that

42
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,060
typically is presented to a user when they're purchasing with Bitcoin.

43
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,240
There's a limited window for the confirmations of the transaction.

44
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,480
And if, say, your transaction isn't confirmed, and in this example, 15 minutes, it's canceled.

45
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,480
Yeah, but if you're sending it to someone and you don't really care how long it takes,

46
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,000
then you can just send it to the network and just wait, right?

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,440
That's why I say if you're just trading the currency and whatnot, it's not a big deal.

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,680
It's only when you're really trying to buy and sell goods, and you want to buy and sell

50
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,880
the goods before the price drops any further.

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,120
Yeah.

52
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,360
So we also talked last week about this idea of each transaction taking as much energy

53
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,160
as a house does in a week.

54
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,240
And that has basically prompted a new, at this stage, kind of vaporware currency called

55
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
Chia.

56
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,780
Ch-ch-ch-Chia.

57
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,780
That's a great name.

58
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,780
Yeah.

59
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,120
Yeah, but in this case, instead of feeding it CPU power, you feed it storage.

60
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,240
Yeah, but this isn't a unique idea.

61
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,200
There are other currencies that do this, but other currencies don't have Bram Cohen behind

62
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
them.

63
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,280
He's the guy who invented BitTorrent.

64
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,000
So he's a big name, and he's raised a lot of money already in VC funding to build this

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
thing.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,700
There is something a little new here with Chia, and it's really kind of a combination

67
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,040
of multiple techniques.

68
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,520
I guess one of the typical weak points of proof of storage cryptos is people were doing

69
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,400
sneaky attacks where they'd add a bunch of storage and then covertly remove it and trick

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,120
the network and then I guess twirl their mustache and run off to the bank.

71
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,560
And Chia has worked in a little failsafe to that.

72
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,640
It relies on proofs of space that have timers set on them.

73
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,440
It combines that to disarm a wide array of attacks to which proofs of space are susceptible.

74
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,760
So does this mean that, along with graphics cards, now hard drives are going to be really

75
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
expensive?

76
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Maybe.

77
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
I guess.

78
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,200
I can picture this like a network here at the studio where we have a dozen machines

79
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,240
and they probably have about 80% of their hard drive free on most of them.

80
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,680
So I don't really see this as purchasing additional storage just to get the cryptocurrency, but

81
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,120
more like using my storage that I'm not currently utilizing.

82
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,400
Yeah, but if there's any money to be made in it, people will buy hard drives, won't

83
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
they?

84
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Yeah.

85
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
It'll give hoarders a whole new reason.

86
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Yeah.

87
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,360
Well, it'll make me get one because I've only got a few hundred gigabytes left in my desktop

88
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,760
machine where I store everything.

89
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:56,400
So maybe I'll have to get a couple of, I don't know, eight terabyte disks or something.

90
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,680
Or you go the other direction and you do it all on your phone.

91
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,480
We talked recently also about Samsung integrating a Linux desktop option on some of their Galaxy

92
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,400
smartphones when you put them in the Dex dock.

93
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,120
And now we appear to have gotten a little proof of concept.

94
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Yeah.

95
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,720
I've got a video of it running now and it says Ubuntu 16, whatever that is.

96
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,400
Although it does say 16.04 somewhere a little bit smaller, which is pretty cool that they've

97
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
actually got a proof of concept.

98
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,720
I don't think that it is just a kind of mock-up, is it?

99
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,800
It does appear to actually be running.

100
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,680
We have a link to the article which has this video embedded in it.

101
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,000
Go to linuxactionnews.com slash 27 and in there about the 12 second mark, you see a

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,520
Linux on Galaxy app and the user runs that.

103
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,320
And then pretty quickly you get the menu, like Joe was saying, for Ubuntu 16.

104
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,880
Also worth noting, there's a plus button there, which would seem to indicate you could add

105
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,480
other distributions, making good on Samsung's promise.

106
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,480
And it seems to be like it's an app that is running the Linux environment.

107
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,720
I'm not sure how it's doing it, if it's like VNC into an X session, which is running in

108
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,800
a contained environment, or if it's a virtualized system and it's all contained within the

109
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
app.

110
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,800
It's not clear from the video.

111
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,200
But the speed seems pretty respectable and they even go as far as launching Eclipse and

112
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:22,740
start doing native ARM development on the phone and Eclipse launches pretty fast, closes

113
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,740
pretty quick.

114
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,560
The whole interface seems to be better than, say, a remote X2Go interface would be.

115
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,800
Yeah, proving that they're really marketing this at developers.

116
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,480
Yeah, that was a point they made in the video at a minute and nine with big white text that

117
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,160
comes up on the screen that really makes the point you can do native ARM development on

118
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,640
this phone.

119
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,120
And you could see how even maybe Android developers would like that for certain types of troubleshooting

120
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,400
or bug fixing.

121
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,200
This really could be aimed squarely at the developer market, sort of like the Dell Sputnik

122
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
program is.

123
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,920
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that us non-developers can't take advantage of the cool toys.

124
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,760
Yeah, I mean, if this really works well, I would be honestly tempted by this.

125
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,600
I was sort of thinking about this story on the drive down to the studio this morning

126
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,840
and I got with me my backpack and I have my laptop and my charger and I have a USB to

127
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,040
Ethernet in there and I have all these extra things that I might need someday.

128
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,440
And it's a lot to carry around.

129
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,240
And I'm here on a Sunday morning, I'm looking at them, all right, I'm bringing my stupid

130
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,920
bag with me to work again.

131
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,880
And at that point of thinking about the story, I thought, it would be kind of nice for what

132
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,880
I need to do today.

133
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,000
I just need to browse the web, respond to Telegram, use some docs.

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,680
I could do all of that if I could put the phone in a doc and just have it in my pocket.

135
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,280
It honestly, it puts another check in the Samsung column for me.

136
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,960
I'm not likely to buy a Samsung phone anytime soon, but if this becomes a regular feature

137
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,680
that is well executed, it will make me reconsider that position.

138
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,240
Yeah, and if it does well and is popular, then it may spread to other OEMs as well,

139
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
which would be nice.

140
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,840
Although thinking about it, Google and their phones would be the obvious choice there,

141
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,520
but they've moved away from developers towards consumers, or at least that's what they're

142
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,040
trying to do, aren't they, with the Pixel line, now they've completely abandoned Nexus.

143
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,520
Yeah, I did feel like the Nexus line was more aimed at developers.

144
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,660
The Pixel does seem to be more consumer-based, but I have to say, if they added this functionality

145
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,000
to the Pixel 3, if there was like a little code exchange between Google and Samsung,

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,920
and they added this to the Pixel 3, boy, I think that would be a slam dunk phone for

147
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
me.

148
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,880
Yeah, well, we're seeing it working with Mario OS, so we know that it is possible.

149
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,600
I don't think that it's, it's not exactly rocket science, it's using existing technologies

150
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:39,400
that are there, LexD and LexC, and just containerization, and okay, it's one thing to say just a bit

151
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,800
of that, but you're not having to reinvent the wheel, you're just having to combine things

152
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
that already exist.

153
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,040
Yeah, I think that's a great point.

154
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,360
That is a really fair point, is it's already built into the host operating system that

155
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,040
Android is built on.

156
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,760
But maybe Google wants us to think more about Chrome OS, and it just got a bit easier to

157
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,280
run Windows apps on Chrome OS.

158
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:03,540
Yeah, thanks to Crossover, which is based on Wine, you can run some Windows apps on

159
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,940
Chrome OS, but there's kind of a few asterisks here.

160
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:12,440
It has to be an x86 based Chromebook, and it has to be one that's capable of running

161
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,000
Android applications.

162
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And the Play services.

163
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,920
Yeah, which are the modern ones, basically.

164
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,640
Not my old C720, unfortunately, it's the touchscreen ones that have come out in the last year or

165
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,360
two that all support Android apps, and this is Crossover as an Android app, which is allowing

166
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,800
you to run Windows applications.

167
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,000
The first example is Office, which seems a bit strange because Google wants everyone

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,520
to use their own Google Docs, don't they?

169
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:44,000
So it's strange that they would allow people to run Microsoft Office.

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,400
I suppose once Crossover is approved to the Play Store, Google doesn't have much say in

171
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,880
what Crossover enables you to do.

172
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,000
And with the Chromebook, you got that full size keyboard most of the time.

173
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,140
It's kind of begging for Office application type uses.

174
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:01,280
But as a desktop Linux user of Crossover Office, what I wonder is if that UI that they've developed

175
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,560
for this is going to make its way over to Linux.

176
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,300
CodeWeavers has been slowly revving the UI with each release pretty steadily, but the

177
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,040
version they've released for Chrome OS is completely redesigned.

178
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,880
And so I would really be curious if somebody at CodeWeavers wants to get a hold of me at

179
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,920
Chris Ellis, will that new version, that new UI, make its way to the desktop because it

180
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,920
looked pretty good.

181
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
Yeah, hopefully.

182
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,160
Well, speaking of looking good, Ubuntu is looking for a new theme and they don't want

183
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
to pay for it.

184
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,720
So they want volunteers from the community to help them out.

185
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,800
I like how you just go after, they won't be willing to pay for it because that crossed

186
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
my mind too.

187
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
I was like, oh, a community theme.

188
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,920
But you know what, Joe, they've had a lot of success with this in the past.

189
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,200
So I'm a bit more of a believer these days than I used to be.

190
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,400
Well, I don't think there's anything particularly wrong with the theme that they've got already

191
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,780
in 1710.

192
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,760
It's not amazingly beautiful, but it's certainly not ugly.

193
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,200
Yeah, you would, you XFCE user, you would be totally fine with it.

194
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Well, yeah.

195
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Are you not fine with it?

196
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,000
You know, it's okay for a few days.

197
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,560
And then after that, I ended up putting Arc Dark and that really looks tight.

198
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,120
It looks really good.

199
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
It's fine.

200
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
It's usable.

201
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,240
It's, I think, gets more crap than it should because the icons are very readable.

202
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,920
It's all very clear.

203
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,080
It's well designed.

204
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,200
It's just old, Joe.

205
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
That's all.

206
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
It's just stale.

207
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,600
But you can have this problem with the icons if you have a new theme that unless you make

208
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,800
an icon for every possible application, you're not going to have consistency there, are you?

209
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Yeah.

210
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,000
That's why I think they're taking a reasonable approach.

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,100
They are going to do a fork, or at least they're going to start with something like Edwardia

212
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,720
and then work on top of that as a base.

213
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,920
And so it's not like they're creating it from whole cloth.

214
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,580
Yeah, but it does kind of contradict this idea that they're still investing in the desktop

215
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,360
because they don't really have much of a design team left and farming this stuff out to the

216
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,520
community.

217
00:11:52,520 --> 00:12:00,340
It just feels like proof of my original feelings that they were effectively abandoning the desktop

218
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,340
to the community.

219
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:05,640
And I know we've talked about how they're joining the GNOME advisory board and they're

220
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,960
pulling their weight there, but this is the real nuts and bolts of the desktop, at least

221
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,520
as far as the Ubuntu users are concerned.

222
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,640
Okay, all the Wayland stuff and all of the plumbing is what really matters.

223
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,520
But what the users are faced with is kind of like the final layer, isn't it?

224
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,480
The gloss on top of it.

225
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:30,680
And if that's just farmed out to the community, it just feels like a bit of a cop out to me.

226
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,080
I can see what you're saying.

227
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,560
It's also pretty heavily connected to branding, which is generally important to these companies.

228
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
I look at it like this.

229
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,640
The problem with the theme is you can never please everybody and a huge percentage of

230
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,960
their more advanced users likely change the theme anyways.

231
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,080
So how much do you really want to invest as a company who's trying to be very careful

232
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,120
about profitability and making development of this project sustainable?

233
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,960
How do you justify investing a whole bunch of staff time into something that a lot of

234
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,040
people are going to change and a lot of people won't like anyways?

235
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,840
It just seems like that is the kind of thing you want to punt to the community.

236
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:07,760
And people who really care will install their own theme and people who don't care will just

237
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
use the default.

238
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
Yeah, I suppose.

239
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,600
And it doesn't really affect me anyway.

240
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,480
I'm just here using Greybird on XFCE.

241
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
That's true.

242
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,520
Although maybe one day, if it's really successful, it'll work its way to XFCE.

243
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,960
If they're basing it on Adwadia, you got a decent base to start with.

244
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,960
With some minor...

245
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,160
Well, I shouldn't say that.

246
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
That's not true.

247
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,720
But with some solid modifications and improvements, you could have another base theme that they

248
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,280
could use for years and it could get passed around.

249
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,520
It could become the next theme.

250
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:43,120
I hear those guys over at System76 might have something they could try.

251
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,840
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

252
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,380
You go there to sign up for a free seven day trial and you support the show and you get

253
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,120
to learn more about Linux.

254
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,400
Seven days too will give you enough time to poke around and try out their self-paced in-depth

255
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
video courses.

256
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,680
They have scenario based labs, which is my favorite because that's what sticks with you.

257
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,600
It gives you the real world experience.

258
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,440
You get SSH into the server and you have a guide to go by.

259
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,680
It'll match whatever distribution you've chosen for the guide.

260
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,960
The virtual servers will match it.

261
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
I love that.

262
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,080
And if you ever get stuck, they have real human beings that can help you.

263
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,440
And if you're super busy, if you got a lot going on these days, you can rest assured

264
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,280
that they'll work with your busy schedule.

265
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:22,000
They have a course scheduler that helps you set goals, stick with them, remind you about

266
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,720
things that are coming up and you can sort of turn it up and turn it down as you need.

267
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,120
Community stacked full of Jupyter broadcasting members and study tools.

268
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,660
They're extremely useful and you can download and take them with you, like audio and text.

269
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,080
And speaking of going with you, they have iOS and Android apps as well.

270
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,360
It's a platform to learn more about Linux and every cloud and DevOps topic, including

271
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:52,640
AWS, OpenStack, Azure, all that big stuff, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

272
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,600
Can you believe it's five years since the Linux Steam client was first released?

273
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Five whole years.

274
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,000
No, actually that doesn't register for me because I still recall talking about the rumors

275
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,720
if it was really going to happen or not and looking at like leaked images and Windows

276
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,760
installers and covering Michael Arbol's early coverage of it where he said it was going

277
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
to happen.

278
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,440
All of that still is very, very vivid in my memory.

279
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
Yeah.

280
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,600
Presumably you were pretty excited about it at the time.

281
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
I was.

282
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,080
I still am.

283
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:25,200
For me personally, Steam on Linux has reached the point where I'm pretty much 100% satisfied.

284
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,880
All of the games I want to play are available for me and I have now way more games than

285
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,160
I ever have time to play.

286
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,120
I've absolutely been saturated.

287
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,460
It's a great problem to have and even if Linux isn't huge for the Steam platform, it's made

288
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:41,200
it completely possible for me to never need to boot into Windows.

289
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,080
Do you think that's a common story with Linux users or do you think there are people who

290
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,480
are still desperate to get the AAA titles on Linux?

291
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
Yes and no.

292
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,940
If you look at the top selling games on Steam right now, like Rocket League and Shadow Tactics

293
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:01,240
and Counter-Strike Global Offensive and Rust and Ark Survival Evolved, Civilization games,

294
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,880
those are all available for Linux and they're the number one seller.

295
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,240
Some of the AAA games aren't available for Linux but the ones that are selling the most

296
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,040
on Steam appear to be available for Linux.

297
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,000
So you think that is quite a healthy situation.

298
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,760
You see, I am totally outside this whole world.

299
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,180
It's very much an academic interest to me because I don't really play games at all.

300
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,920
So it's difficult for me to judge but you have historically been quite a gamer, haven't

301
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,920
you?

302
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
I've always tried to be a gamer.

303
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,880
I've unsuccessfully tried to be a gamer constantly because I love the idea of just sitting down

304
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,720
and having a great gaming experience and I get them from time to time.

305
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,040
I've recently been really enjoying Rust.

306
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,540
Mostly it's because I'm playing with other people that I really like.

307
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,520
The elephant in the room about gaming on Linux, specifically Steam, is that if you look at

308
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,060
the raw numbers, it appears Linux is doing quite bad.

309
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:54,840
It's recently at 0.35% which is below the 2% it nearly was at the peak when Steam launched

310
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
on Linux.

311
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,680
So it would appear from the raw numbers that it's way down.

312
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,720
However, that's also because Steam itself has grown considerably and there's certain

313
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,760
aspects to the market that are only available to Windows users like the HTC Vive platform.

314
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,440
So I think the state of Linux gaming is stronger than it has been but we're sort of all waiting

315
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:22,760
for the transition to Vulkan to land because that looks to be very good for Linux.

316
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,920
There's a couple of games, speaking of AAA games that came out, a racing game recently

317
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,920
came out.

318
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:33,760
Gorgeous game, AAA title, day one support for Linux and it's a Vulkan game.

319
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,320
And friend of the show Wimpy was telling me about some of the unbelievable frame rates

320
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,920
he was getting using external graphics and it's very promising.

321
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:48,360
It's over 100 frames per second on a AAA title using Vulkan on day one launch for Linux.

322
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,680
I wonder what you'd get under Windows for that, presumably a little bit more.

323
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,920
Knowing Wimpy, I bet you he will test all of those things.

324
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,440
I hope we will hear a full report from him soon and it's very promising.

325
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,440
Over 100 frames per second using external graphics on Linux, that doesn't even seem

326
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,420
like something that would have even been possible a few years ago and if that trend continues,

327
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,900
we might see more and more games come to Linux just as a result of all the fundamental technology

328
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,320
is being supported by Linux.

329
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,760
But the whole Steam on Linux was a precursor to the Steam machines, wasn't it?

330
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,120
And that has just not really worked out at all, has it?

331
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,840
Yeah, it seemed like a big hedge, it seemed like a market reaction to the Windows Store

332
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,400
and to Microsoft's strategies.

333
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,720
But that threat isn't necessarily gone and Microsoft is continually getting more competitive

334
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,320
in the gaming industry.

335
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,900
They've really integrated the Xbox Live platform into all gaming aspects.

336
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,880
The new Minecraft is heavily integrated into the Xbox experience, even if you're playing

337
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,320
it on the Windows platform.

338
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,560
That continues to be a fundamental threat to Valve's business model.

339
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,520
So you think they're keeping it on the back burner and are ready to pounce if necessary

340
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,520
then?

341
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
I'd like to say that's the case.

342
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,640
I'd really like to say that Valve is one of those companies that's unlike most companies

343
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,920
in the tech field and that they're willing to invest over time slowly, maybe even for

344
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:08,240
a decade into something, just to make sure it's right before they fully launch it or

345
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,560
it really takes over.

346
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,780
They're willing to take that slow burn approach for a lot of their projects.

347
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,580
So I'm inclined to hope that's the case, Joe.

348
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,580
But we just got to wait and see.

349
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,800
And meanwhile, we're still getting great games for Linux.

350
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,280
So as long as my Linux desktop is still getting great games, I really don't care what happens

351
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
with Steam machines.

352
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,680
Yeah, but the thing is that all it takes is one game to not be available to drive people

353
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,960
to Windows or to keep people on Windows, rather.

354
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,640
There's a person I know, I tried to convert him to Linux, I tried to say, look, you've

355
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,240
got Steam available, and if not, then you've got to play on Linux and Wine and stuff.

356
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,440
But there was just one game that he wanted to play, some stupid casino game or something,

357
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,540
I don't even know.

358
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,780
And it just wouldn't work.

359
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,140
And so he was like, well, I'm not using Linux, then it's as simple as that.

360
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:57,580
So until you get 100% of the Steam games available for Linux, you're going to have a lot of people

361
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,840
who will just not move over.

362
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,000
Don't you feel like that's true for gaming in general, though?

363
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,960
Like I'm tempted right now by a Nintendo Switch because it's the only platform that has Mario

364
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,680
Odyssey, and that would technically be taking gameplay time away from Linux.

365
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,840
I think the nice thing that Linux has going for it is I can't install the Xbox OS on my

366
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,840
Nintendo Switch.

367
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,940
So I can play the hell out of Mario Odyssey for six months and then be bored and want

368
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,880
to load a different OS on my Nintendo to play a different game, can't do it.

369
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,840
At least with x86 hardware, you can be drawn to Windows for a game, and if time heals those

370
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,960
wounds and makes that game available for Linux, they at least have the option of utilizing

371
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,920
the same hardware investment.

372
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:43,520
And that gives Linux a slight edge over like typical consoles or other platforms.

373
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,200
Yeah, that's true.

374
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,200
And you can do both as well, which you can't really do on consoles these days.

375
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,160
So yeah, there is the option there to have both.

376
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,040
Of course, Munich doesn't see it that way.

377
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,600
It appears this is based on translation in the Linux unplugged subreddit, that the vote

378
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,500
to move to Windows 10 in Munich has completed.

379
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
It's done.

380
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,420
It's over, and it's been decided.

381
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,800
Over a two-year period, 29,000 PCs will be migrated from Linux to Windows 10.

382
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,880
The dream is officially over.

383
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,200
The poster child for an open source in government is dead.

384
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,380
Joe, why do you suppose they had to have their own customized version of Linux, which ended

385
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:25,320
up being a huge hassle, but they're totally fine with stock Windows 10?

386
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,640
Well, it's politics, isn't it?

387
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,480
And incompetence of politicians.

388
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,120
We've been saying this throughout the whole thing, that if they'd gone with Red Hat, Suza,

389
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,800
Ubuntu, and gone for a properly supported Linux, okay, it would have been a little bit

390
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,960
more upfront investment, but we probably wouldn't be having this conversation now.

391
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,600
They wouldn't have gone back to Windows because it wouldn't have necessarily worked out cheaper

392
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,420
to do so.

393
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:57,840
So why they rolled their own, presumably cost is the only thing I can think of.

394
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,480
It must have been cheaper for them to do that.

395
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,120
They must have done the maths of that, but not thinking ahead about the maintenance cost

396
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,280
of it all.

397
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:10,400
That surely could be the only driver here, unless there was some ideological reason that

398
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,440
they wanted to create something that other people could benefit from, but that just doesn't

399
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,680
really make sense, does it?

400
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,680
Because everyone can benefit, at least from Ubuntu.

401
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,720
This is my recollection, and I've been following this story so long that I've forgotten more

402
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,800
about it than I can recall.

403
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,960
But my recollection was, they specifically went with their own distribution because they

404
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,120
made tweaks that made the migration from Windows for their users easier, made accommodations

405
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,400
for their network and internet, and allowed them to package custom versions of some of

406
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,240
the major software, like OpenOffice, I don't remember if you recall, but they forked their

407
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,120
own version of OpenOffice with their own certain plugins.

408
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:55,620
And so that sort of necessitated Limux, and then all of these customizations became very

409
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,840
hard to move forward to future versions of Linux they wanted to base Limux off of.

410
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,880
And they kind of got trapped in their own technical debt to a degree, and then the users

411
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,880
got frustrated with the experience.

412
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,200
And that's finally what broke this issue, is the users were just getting sick and tired

413
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,160
of a system that wasn't up to snuff.

414
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,760
You've got to imagine people come in from other companies, they come in from other areas

415
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,880
of government and they see this, where they don't have these problems, and it must be

416
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,160
ridiculous to them.

417
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,280
And so this user pushback just grew and grew and grew over time, because it's a huge project

418
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,040
to develop your own operating system, especially one that's highly customized, and then to

419
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,500
ship it to end users workstations and get them upgraded and keep them up to date.

420
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,440
It's a massive task in a government like that.

421
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,240
And to your point, if they'd gone with the mainstream distribution, they would have had

422
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,560
that burden removed, but they would have had a higher initial training cost.

423
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,080
But that would have ultimately worked out to be much better for them, probably.

424
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,040
It definitely wouldn't have been as embarrassing, because this thing has been a public sideshow

425
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,760
now for a decade.

426
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,400
Yeah, and it's not done any favors for Linux and open source generally, has it?

427
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,240
If you think about other governments or whatever thinking about making the switch, this has

428
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,820
got to really put them off.

429
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,280
Even though they don't necessarily drill down into the details and realize they rolled their

430
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:15,000
own and didn't go with a mainstream distro, it just looks bad generally, doesn't it?

431
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,320
Well it's sure going to give some great quotes for total cost of ownership quotes by Microsoft

432
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
salesmen.

433
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
I'll give it that.

434
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
Yep.

435
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,800
Speaking of surprising the open source community, Apple will no longer be developing CUPS under

436
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,880
the GPL.

437
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,640
This snapped a few heads around this week.

438
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,640
Yeah, they're going to move to the Apache license, which, okay, it's still open source,

439
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,360
it's still free software, so does it really matter?

440
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,680
Well, you've got to kind of look a bit deeper than that, haven't you, to realize why it

441
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,280
ultimately might well matter.

442
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,880
CUPS is the common Unix printing system, and it's been the engine for printing on Linux

443
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,520
for ages now.

444
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,120
And years ago, it was bought by Apple, and everyone always wondered, well, what's going

445
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,440
to happen now?

446
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,760
And they have been, to their credit, pretty good stewards of the project.

447
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,760
It continues on.

448
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,560
They hired the developer full time, they gave him a full time wage to work on CUPS at Apple.

449
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,920
But my understanding has been there have been companies, hardware manufacturers, that have

450
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,080
been knocking on Apple's door and saying, we want to bundle CUPS in our print server.

451
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,680
We want to bundle it right here on chip with our little Ethernet-attached print server.

452
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,800
Can we do that?

453
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,560
And Apple says, is the source code available?

454
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,600
It's under the GPL.

455
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:30,600
And the hardware manufacturers go, oh, no thanks.

456
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,080
And they go roll their own solution.

457
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,280
What, you think the GPL is that toxic?

458
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,720
I don't think it is, but apparently this is some of these hardware manufacturers' opinion,

459
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,720
based on what I've read.

460
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,760
Yeah, and so the much more permissive Apache license means that they're not going to care

461
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
about that sort of thing.

462
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,560
Yeah, it means we're probably going to start seeing embedded CUPS that then doesn't get

463
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,240
updated for ages.

464
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,040
So it's not necessarily going to be a good thing, but it might be better than what we

465
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
have now.

466
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
Might it, though?

467
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:01,320
Because isn't the risk here that Apple will create a two-tiered system where they'll have

468
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:06,680
Apple CUPS, which will be proprietary, but it'll be based on the open source one?

469
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,880
Kind of like with their Bluetooth thing, isn't it, where you've got, it's based on a relatively

470
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,280
open standard of Bluetooth, but then they bundle their proprietary stuff on top to make

471
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,380
it better.

472
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:21,560
And that's what makes their product a more appealing proposition for people.

473
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
We'll see.

474
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,560
I mean, I feel like printing is such a solid industry now.

475
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,560
It's sort of like if we had to just take CUPS that we had today, the GPL version, and Apple

476
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,200
never wrote another line of code, I feel like we'd be OK.

477
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,520
We're like in the Thunderbird situation here, where we kind of know what we got.

478
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,320
We're not really seeing new radical printing devices come on the market that totally change

479
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
everything.

480
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,320
CUPS has a lot of runway, even in its current version, tons of things you can do with it.

481
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,120
I feel like we'd be pretty good in this particular position.

482
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,640
Apple can do whatever the hell they want, because at the end of the day, we still have

483
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,520
the code that was licensed under GPL.

484
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,720
Yeah, but we are moving to driverless printing and stuff.

485
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,280
There is innovation still happening there.

486
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:02,680
And if CUPS doesn't continue to keep up with that stuff, then it could be left behind.

487
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,680
I agree.

488
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,520
And I think the other story here is, what about all the contributors over the years

489
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:10,480
that have contributed to this project, assuming it would remain GPL?

490
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,040
Was there some sort of contributors agreement that they assigned that said it would be OK

491
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
to relicense?

492
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,200
I believe there was.

493
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,400
And is this maybe another opportunity to talk about these contributor agreements again?

494
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,800
Because some of these developers may have contributed code under good faith that it

495
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,800
would remain a GPL project.

496
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Of course, they're the ones that would have signed the agreement.

497
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,600
Well, that's the thing, if you sign the agreement, then faith is the right word.

498
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,160
There is no evidence to prove that it is going to remain under GPL.

499
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:41,440
So you're signing away your rights to that.

500
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,600
And if you don't like that, then don't sign the document.

501
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:48,440
I tend to think in this particular story, the sky is not falling.

502
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,760
Because if Apple was going to pull the rug out from underneath CUPS, they probably would

503
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,380
have done it years ago.

504
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,400
And they continued to invest in this project since they purchased it, since they hired

505
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,440
this guy.

506
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,200
I would imagine they're just going to continue investing in it now with a different license.

507
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,720
Because in a way, it's in Apple's best interest for there to be more CUPS users.

508
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,920
Because it means the printing experience on Macs will be better.

509
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,400
Yeah, that's true.

510
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,960
Although, to be fair, these days, who has a printer outside of their office?

511
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
Yeah.

512
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,320
But when I do print, I love it.

513
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,320
It feels retro.

514
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,320
I'm like, this is great.

515
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,320
It smells good.

516
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,680
I love the laser printer, Joe.

517
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,560
Well, I've got a laser printer.

518
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,320
And it always worked in Ubuntu 12.04 as Ubuntu 12.04.

519
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,940
And then I updated to 14.04.

520
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,940
And it's never worked since.

521
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,240
I have to boot into Windows for it.

522
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
I'm sorry.

523
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Did you say 14.04?

524
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
Yeah.

525
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
Yeah.

526
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,600
I'm having a real hard time feeling bad for you, Joe.

527
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
I'm having a...

528
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
No, no.

529
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
Well, I'm 16.04 as well.

530
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,600
Oh, OK.

531
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,420
I'm saying since I updated to 14.04, whenever that was, it has just never worked.

532
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,400
And then I updated to 16.04, tried it again, no joy.

533
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,840
You know, this is one of the things I love about CUPS.

534
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,640
If you dig around in the config, you can turn on the web interface.

535
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,520
And you get even way more powerful options, including just manually setting up an IP printer

536
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
that's dead simple.

537
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,640
It's a great web interface for CUPS.

538
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,240
It's one of my favorite projects.

539
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,360
And it was one of the original projects that let me set up a ton of Linux boxes at a company

540
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,440
because Windows couldn't handle their print load, and CUPS handled it like a champ.

541
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
Yeah.

542
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,840
Well, you can go into dual.config, or you can just quickly reboot into your wife's Windows

543
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,840
7 partition.

544
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,340
