00:00.000 --> 00:09.640
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 245, recorded on June 14th, 2022.

00:09.640 --> 00:10.640
I'm Chris.

00:10.640 --> 00:11.640
And I'm Wes.

00:11.640 --> 00:12.640
Hello, Wes.

00:12.640 --> 00:14.080
Let's do the news.

00:14.080 --> 00:18.000
We start this week with two old favorites getting together.

00:18.000 --> 00:23.120
The Thunderbird project has announced that the K9 Mail app is not only joining the project,

00:23.120 --> 00:28.120
but will ultimately transform into Thunderbird for Android.

00:28.120 --> 00:33.560
Yeah, this has been in the works for some time, but it's only now becoming public as

00:33.560 --> 00:40.360
Christian Ketter is joining MZLA Technologies, that's the home to Thunderbird, as a full-time

00:40.360 --> 00:43.960
staffer as of June 1st.

00:43.960 --> 00:49.400
This acquihire really kind of underscores how much things have changed for Thunderbird.

00:49.400 --> 00:54.840
On the ropes, really just a few years ago, almost shut down by Mozilla, it's now no

00:54.840 --> 00:58.920
longer part of the foundation, but not just standing on its own.

00:58.920 --> 00:59.920
It's thriving.

00:59.920 --> 01:04.320
We'll probably get some more details published publicly soon, but I had a chance to chat

01:04.320 --> 01:06.340
with Ryan Sipes earlier today.

01:06.340 --> 01:10.760
He's the product and business developer manager for Thunderbird, and he informs me that Thunderbird's

01:10.760 --> 01:15.760
in a much better place these days, saying that nearly $3.5 million in revenue has been

01:15.760 --> 01:21.200
achieved with 99.9% of that coming from donations by the users.

01:21.200 --> 01:25.280
And that's given them the ability to staff up to just over 20 people with the bandwidth

01:25.280 --> 01:28.740
to execute on plans.

01:28.740 --> 01:33.720
And using some of that prosperity to make an acquihire like Christian Ketter makes good

01:33.720 --> 01:34.720
sense.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.820
I mean, was it ever going to be practical to port Thunderbird to Android at least any

01:38.820 --> 01:39.820
time soon?

01:39.820 --> 01:44.340
Plus, you're going to have to compete with K9 itself, which is doing a great job.

01:44.340 --> 01:48.640
This way, they get to work together, plus, I mean, there's got to be some long-term benefits

01:48.640 --> 01:50.600
from having Christian on staff as well.

01:50.600 --> 01:54.480
Yeah, that all makes sense too, and I kind of get the sense that perhaps Christian was

01:54.480 --> 01:57.960
reaching the end of his runway with K9.

01:57.960 --> 02:02.040
It is a massive, massive project to take on for one developer.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.900
When you consider you have to run a business, you have to provide support, you have to deal

02:04.900 --> 02:09.080
with the Google Play Store and users, and then actually find time to develop.

02:09.080 --> 02:11.560
So I think it makes sense.

02:11.560 --> 02:14.080
So it seems like a nice straightforward fit for everyone.

02:14.080 --> 02:18.680
But where I don't see things fitting so well is the different user bases of Thunderbird

02:18.680 --> 02:19.680
and K9.

02:19.680 --> 02:23.360
I mean, I think it's probably reasonable to assume that both user bases have probably

02:23.360 --> 02:28.080
found their current mail app after trying either the default on their platform or another

02:28.080 --> 02:30.600
email app that they just didn't like.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.840
So maybe they're a little more particular about the way things work with their email

02:33.840 --> 02:36.040
app than your average user.

02:36.040 --> 02:40.460
And that seems like it's going to be a tricky thing for Thunderbird to balance and get just

02:40.460 --> 02:41.920
right going forward.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.600
So I asked Ryan just about that very thing.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.600
Sure.

02:46.600 --> 02:50.120
It's not easy and it is, like you said, it is balancing.

02:50.120 --> 02:54.920
It's a balancing act in that mobile and desktop are not the same devices.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.980
They're not the same size, they don't work the same.

02:57.980 --> 03:03.060
It's a very different experience and user expectations are different there.

03:03.060 --> 03:08.880
But I feel like K9 was the best reflection of like what a Thunderbird experience on mobile

03:08.880 --> 03:10.700
would look like.

03:10.700 --> 03:17.720
And at our core, our values were exactly the same and that was the values of open standards

03:17.720 --> 03:26.000
and open source, respecting the user and enabling power users with customization and the ability

03:26.000 --> 03:28.080
to control their workflows.

03:28.080 --> 03:36.100
And so I think that if we continue to carry those values into what we work on both sides,

03:36.100 --> 03:40.840
I think that our users are enough alike in those respects that they'll be happy with

03:40.840 --> 03:41.840
the outcome.

03:41.840 --> 03:47.500
And then the practical side of that is since Kedi came on, we've been kind of doing a little

03:47.500 --> 03:48.880
bit of a cultural exchange.

03:48.880 --> 03:54.720
I've been talking a lot and various team members on our side have been talking a lot to K9

03:54.720 --> 04:01.280
mail users to better understand their wants and needs and he's been talking to quite a

04:01.280 --> 04:07.960
few of our users and so in that way, we're trying to see where the similarities are and

04:07.960 --> 04:11.440
where the differences are and try to accommodate those.

04:11.440 --> 04:16.480
I suppose time will tell, but I'd say that sounds like a pretty good mindset going into

04:16.480 --> 04:17.480
things.

04:17.480 --> 04:22.560
We also got the sense from Ryan that a couple of big desktop releases are in the works for

04:22.560 --> 04:24.360
Thunderbird as well.

04:24.360 --> 04:31.160
So we'll be keeping an eye out for that.

04:31.160 --> 04:35.520
Now those of us still wanting to build a RISC-V desktop or server one day will be happy to

04:35.520 --> 04:42.040
hear that Ubuntu is hard at work at bringing up and improving support for the Star 5 Vision

04:42.040 --> 04:44.360
5 RISC-V board.

04:44.360 --> 04:50.540
Michael Lonerbal over at Ferronix calls the $179 device quote, one of the most promising

04:50.540 --> 04:57.720
low cost RISC-V single board computers to date intended to run full blown RISC-V Linux

04:57.720 --> 04:59.920
distributions.

04:59.920 --> 05:04.000
And you know what, we got to agree with him on that.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.740
The board comes in two varieties with four gigs or eight gigs of system memory powered

05:08.740 --> 05:14.900
by a dual core PSI-5U74RV64SOC clocked at one gigahertz.

05:14.900 --> 05:21.440
But it's also got an NV-DLA deep learning accelerator, a 10 silica VP6 vision DSP and

05:21.440 --> 05:23.440
oh yeah, a neural network engine.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.440
Woo.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.440
Yeah, okay.

05:25.440 --> 05:29.400
I mean, I'm not blown away by the one gigahertz clock speed of the main CPU, but you do got

05:29.400 --> 05:33.960
to start somewhere and they move more and more functionality off under these dedicated

05:33.960 --> 05:38.560
co-processors, that performance story starts getting a little more complicated.

05:38.560 --> 05:42.880
And keeping the price down means that these boards get in the hands of more developers.

05:42.880 --> 05:43.880
So that seems like a good thing.

05:43.880 --> 05:49.960
And of course, it means Ubuntu developers can work on enabling their Star 5 Vision boards

05:49.960 --> 05:53.760
and getting their RISC-V kernel builds working on those boards.

05:53.760 --> 06:00.640
And that's going to mean more RISC hardware for everybody.

06:00.640 --> 06:06.600
Because apparently there are always more clouds that need more operating systems.

06:06.600 --> 06:11.920
This week, the Fedora Engineering and Steering Committee decided to relist their cloud spin

06:11.920 --> 06:14.440
as an official Fedora edition.

06:14.440 --> 06:21.280
Interestingly, this change was led by an Amazon AWS engineer who's also a Fedora contributor.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.200
His name is David Duncan.

06:23.200 --> 06:29.160
In his proposal, Duncan wrote, quote, cloud should be listed on getfedora.org along with

06:29.160 --> 06:32.720
workstation, server, and IoT.

06:32.720 --> 06:37.680
The petition to reinstate the cloud base as an official edition is based on the clear

06:37.680 --> 06:43.240
identification of unique environmental support requirements for both private hyperscalers

06:43.240 --> 06:49.600
as well as public cloud environments that are not specifically addressed by other editions.

06:49.600 --> 06:56.080
Currently, Fedora Cloud is listed as an alternative download and not the same level as other editions

06:56.080 --> 06:58.520
like workstation or server.

06:58.520 --> 07:01.960
Fedora Cloud base images are produced in a raw image form.

07:01.960 --> 07:07.200
So you've got builds for OpenStack, VirtualBox, and KVM images for Google Cloud Platform,

07:07.200 --> 07:09.640
AWS, of course, and others.

07:09.640 --> 07:13.200
So this proposal was looked at and received unanimous approval and will go into effect

07:13.200 --> 07:22.480
for Fedora 37 this fall, assuming everything goes as planned.

07:22.480 --> 07:26.280
Plasma 5.25 has just been released.

07:26.280 --> 07:31.360
This latest version brings new features, of course, but also new workflow concepts to

07:31.360 --> 07:33.600
the desktop environment.

07:33.600 --> 07:34.800
This is a big one, guys.

07:34.800 --> 07:40.480
There's been a lot of focus on gestures this release for the trackpads and for touchscreens,

07:40.480 --> 07:42.440
which look particularly great.

07:42.440 --> 07:47.840
And then visually, they've reworked the overview effect so it's much cleaner and modern looking.

07:47.840 --> 07:53.520
And they've added this neat ability to sync your desktop accent colors with your wallpaper.

07:53.520 --> 07:58.360
Yeah, that makes for definitely subtle but a nice effect that kind of ties your whole

07:58.360 --> 08:00.760
desktop together.

08:00.760 --> 08:05.440
And if you happen to use the slideshow as your wallpaper, the colors will update when

08:05.440 --> 08:07.960
the wallpaper changes.

08:07.960 --> 08:09.960
That's just a nice touch.

08:09.960 --> 08:14.760
5.25 also makes some smart adjustments automatically when you invoke touch mode.

08:14.760 --> 08:18.960
For example, the task manager and the system tray become just a little bit bigger, and

08:18.960 --> 08:22.760
the title bars of KDE applications become taller.

08:22.760 --> 08:27.560
And they have this new floating panel mode, which looks so cool.

08:27.560 --> 08:32.040
And longtime plasma users, you're going to want to check out the new rewritten kwin script

08:32.040 --> 08:33.040
settings page.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.200
You're going to like it.

08:34.200 --> 08:38.840
And you'll probably also enjoy the new keyboard navigation options for plasma panels.

08:38.840 --> 08:40.120
Of course, I'm still trying it all out.

08:40.120 --> 08:47.760
I've got it installed right now on my KDE neon box.

08:47.760 --> 08:51.920
We wanted to take a moment to make sure you're aware that one of our favorite tools had an

08:51.920 --> 08:53.680
update this week.

08:53.680 --> 08:57.040
That tool, well, it's ventoy.

08:57.040 --> 09:00.140
If you're not familiar, then you must not be listening to Linux unplugged.

09:00.140 --> 09:05.840
But ventoy is a popular bootable USB utility that makes it easy to store multiple different

09:05.840 --> 09:11.760
ISOs and then choose which one to boot right on the fly.

09:11.760 --> 09:17.600
Version 1.0.76 now supports secure boot by default, including a much improved ability

09:17.600 --> 09:20.720
to enroll secure boot keys.

09:20.720 --> 09:24.400
Along with that important update, though, they've also added additional ISO support,

09:24.400 --> 09:27.680
which brings the total supported number over 900.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.400
Plus, there's bug fixes, small improvements, the usual.

09:31.400 --> 09:39.040
We'll have a link in the show notes if you're still not using ventoy.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.820
Linode dot com slash LAN.

09:40.820 --> 09:45.320
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support this

09:45.320 --> 09:46.440
here show.

09:46.440 --> 09:50.520
Linode is really how we make all of the things that we pull off online possible and you should

09:50.520 --> 09:51.520
too.

09:51.520 --> 09:52.520
It's fast.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.520
It's reliable.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.080
They've been doing this for nearly 19 years.

09:55.080 --> 09:56.080
Go try them out.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.200
Go see what I've been talking about.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.760
Go put that $100 to use.

09:59.760 --> 10:04.200
They've really been focused at making the best platform to run applications on Linux

10:04.200 --> 10:06.280
for almost 20 years.

10:06.280 --> 10:09.880
That's led to the best in class experience and why we host everything on Linode.

10:09.880 --> 10:14.160
You combine the stability, the performance, the support, the selections.

10:14.160 --> 10:17.560
They're always deploying the latest Linux distributions if that's what you like to do.

10:17.560 --> 10:21.600
Of course, they have the classics like you might expect, like your Alma's and your Rockies.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.400
One thing that I like to try is just go to their marketplace from time to time and see

10:24.400 --> 10:29.440
what their apps are for the one click deployment because they're often adding new stuff.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.800
There's always things on the backend you could take advantage of or not depending on how

10:32.800 --> 10:39.080
complicated you want things like VLAN support, DDoS protection, a powerful DNS manager, and

10:39.080 --> 10:41.220
they have super fast networking.

10:41.220 --> 10:43.260
They are their own ISP.

10:43.260 --> 10:46.880
With prices 30% to 50% cheaper than the major cloud providers out there, you get a great

10:46.880 --> 10:50.440
deal too with great service.

10:50.440 --> 10:55.580
As I record, there's still about 17 days to create an open source project and win some

10:55.580 --> 10:58.320
serious prizes from Linode.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.400
They're partnering with Hashnode.

10:59.400 --> 11:03.080
They have a hackathon running from June 1st to June 30th.

11:03.080 --> 11:08.160
Grand prizes, there'll be runner-up prizes, swag, and you'll even just get something for

11:08.160 --> 11:09.160
participating.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.840
And I'm talking cash prizes.

11:11.840 --> 11:14.600
So go check out Linode's Twitter account for details on that.

11:14.600 --> 11:17.720
But first, go to linode.com slash LAN.

11:17.720 --> 11:22.240
Support the show and get that $100 on a new account and really kick the tires.

11:22.240 --> 11:28.600
It's linode.com slash LAN.

11:28.600 --> 11:33.960
We end this week with Adobe, which has recently announced its plans to make Photoshop on the

11:33.960 --> 11:36.800
web free for everyone.

11:36.800 --> 11:42.440
Now, right now, the company's testing this free version in Canada, where users can access

11:42.440 --> 11:46.080
Photoshop on the web with a free account.

11:46.080 --> 11:52.040
Adobe describes the service as, quote, freemium, and eventually plans to gate off some features

11:52.040 --> 11:56.520
that will be exclusive to paying subscribers, because of course they will.

11:56.520 --> 12:00.880
But they do say that enough tools will be freely available to perform what they consider

12:00.880 --> 12:04.820
Photoshop's, quote, core functions.

12:04.820 --> 12:10.840
So I guess this is technically Photoshop coming to Linux eventually.

12:10.840 --> 12:13.000
And then maybe we always kind of figured it would go this way.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.000
But you know, it still struck me as funny, Wes.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.880
This just feels like yet another example where for decades we pined as a Linux community

12:20.880 --> 12:24.700
to have somebody bring their application to Linux.

12:24.700 --> 12:29.400
And then when that finally arrives, it's never quite how we pictured it was going to be.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.480
You know, it's always kind of a little bit different.

12:31.480 --> 12:36.720
Like if I wanted to Photoshop on the web, I'd just use Photopea at Photopea.com like

12:36.720 --> 12:38.960
right now.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.200
We've arrived in the future where I thought we'd have all these native apps.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.480
And what we have is a bunch of web apps.

12:43.480 --> 12:50.600
Yeah, I mean, what, 10, 15 years ago, Chris, you know, Linux desktop hopefuls, probably

12:50.600 --> 12:54.840
hoping for some sort of like, native, cute thing, you know, it felt like it was home

12:54.840 --> 12:55.840
on the Linux desktop.

12:55.840 --> 13:02.640
It was all the same logic, full functionality, just like a native first class Linux version.

13:02.640 --> 13:08.080
And instead, I mean, yes, we've watched the rise of web apps more generally, but we've

13:08.080 --> 13:13.000
also seen the rise of Electron and companies deciding that that's the target they're going

13:13.000 --> 13:15.680
to adopt to go multi platform.

13:15.680 --> 13:20.600
But at the same time, we've sort of seen the success of Wine, which has kind of hedged

13:20.600 --> 13:22.000
off in the same direction, right?

13:22.000 --> 13:26.320
Now we're clamoring less for some of these applications, because whether it's Wine directly,

13:26.320 --> 13:33.160
or now that we've got Proton, there's a compatibility shim we can apply and it's kind of just good

13:33.160 --> 13:34.160
enough.

13:34.160 --> 13:38.020
So I don't know if I'm disappointed or just realistic, but it's kind of wild in how many

13:38.020 --> 13:42.000
different domains this has happened from, you know, from the modern version of Outlook

13:42.000 --> 13:46.800
for Office 365, almost everything's on the web these days.

13:46.800 --> 13:52.000
And I guess that means the operating system is just a lot less important, at least as

13:52.000 --> 13:53.480
long as it runs Chrome.

13:53.480 --> 13:57.400
Yeah, maybe that's part of what I'm feeling here a little bit of that.

13:57.400 --> 14:01.720
But then there's the like the practical side, like you say, people who need Photoshop on

14:01.720 --> 14:07.240
Linux that would like to use Linux, they had now will, I mean, they're gonna have an option

14:07.240 --> 14:08.240
for the first time.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.420
It's actual real Photoshop.

14:09.420 --> 14:14.480
That's kind of incredible, because I know I have been multiple times in the position

14:14.480 --> 14:19.720
of needing to get Photoshop going under Wine, just because somebody sent me a Photoshop

14:19.720 --> 14:24.520
file that maybe we contracted with, or, you know, I'm going to open up some legacy show

14:24.520 --> 14:27.720
art and that's in a Photoshop file format.

14:27.720 --> 14:31.320
And you know, the whole rigmarole of trying to get that working under Wine, trying to

14:31.320 --> 14:35.240
get the right version, do I have the ability to license it, that kind of stuff, it'd be

14:35.240 --> 14:36.800
nice just to see all that go away.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.600
So a free version is a good thing.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.440
It means more people have access to this.

14:41.440 --> 14:48.400
And it also it's worth mentioning that this historically been like a very expensive application.

14:48.400 --> 14:53.300
Photoshop alone used to be over a grand, then they locked it behind the Creative Cloud membership.

14:53.300 --> 14:56.640
And the other factor is the other real practical thing that you kind of made me think about

14:56.640 --> 15:01.160
here is for most people, the core functionality is probably enough.

15:01.160 --> 15:03.200
The free functionality is probably going to be enough.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.440
Ah, you're right.

15:04.440 --> 15:09.120
I mean, does that does that hurt the use case for some of our our favorite tools like GIMP?

15:09.120 --> 15:12.840
You know, the things that we're kind of meeting that low common denominator baseline, but now

15:12.840 --> 15:16.760
it's now it's just another web sass that you're going to use instead.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.280
Maybe I don't know.

15:18.280 --> 15:20.260
Or do people really prefer native apps?

15:20.260 --> 15:25.520
Or perhaps because it took Adobe so long to bring Photoshop to Linux?

15:25.520 --> 15:30.280
Maybe things like GIMP have enough of an established user base that they don't have to worry now?

15:30.280 --> 15:31.280
It's possible.

15:31.280 --> 15:34.880
I do also wonder if we're going to see this continue with the rest of the suite, you know,

15:34.880 --> 15:38.360
kind of kind of as you mentioned, because it's been so long, we just still haven't gotten

15:38.360 --> 15:43.960
Photoshop, whether it's photopea, or GIMP, or other other tools or whole virtual machines,

15:43.960 --> 15:45.360
folks have come up with workarounds.

15:45.360 --> 15:50.560
But if this ends up being the whole creative suite that's easy to access online, that might

15:50.560 --> 15:51.560
be hard to resist.

15:51.560 --> 15:55.400
True, wouldn't that be something after effects in a web browser?

15:55.400 --> 15:57.640
And you could see it going that way.

15:57.640 --> 16:03.000
Companies have limited resources, limited time, even rich companies.

16:03.000 --> 16:10.400
And this is just clearly a easy, honestly, very available, like both in skill set.

16:10.400 --> 16:15.720
And in technology, it's very easy and available to do this kind of web app development now.

16:15.720 --> 16:20.720
And it just gives you cross app, cross device, cross platform compatibility just out of the

16:20.720 --> 16:22.160
box.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.840
So yeah, I think you're right, Wes, I think we're gonna see a lot more things go this

16:25.840 --> 16:26.840
way.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.520
In the entire creative suite.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.400
Let us know what you think out there.

16:30.400 --> 16:36.240
And whichever way it goes, native applications, web applications, or no applications at all,

16:36.240 --> 16:37.240
we'll let you know.

16:37.240 --> 16:41.680
Just go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

16:41.680 --> 16:46.160
And linuxactionnews.com slash contact to let us know why Adobe should probably be using

16:46.160 --> 16:47.160
Flutter.

16:47.160 --> 16:48.160
That's right.

16:48.160 --> 16:53.880
And of course, you can support this show and all the network shows and get them ad free

16:53.880 --> 16:57.240
by going to Jupiter.party and becoming a member.

16:57.240 --> 17:01.080
As for this show, well, don't worry, we'll be back next week with our take on the latest

17:01.080 --> 17:03.840
Linux and open source news.

17:03.840 --> 17:04.840
Thanks for joining us.

17:04.840 --> 17:24.200
And that's all the news for this week.
