Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.060 --> 00:19.540
This is episode 9, recorded on July 9th, 2017.

00:19.540 --> 00:20.540
I'm Chris.

00:20.540 --> 00:21.540
And I'm Joe.

00:21.540 --> 00:25.780
Joe, there's many things to dig into today, but I thought we'd start with one that was

00:25.780 --> 00:27.300
relatively uplifting.

00:27.300 --> 00:31.640
There's a new release, Endless OS version 3.2 is out.

00:31.640 --> 00:37.240
And the big news is it's rebased from Gnome Shell 3.8 to Gnome Shell 3.22.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.040
That's not much of a jump, is it?

00:39.040 --> 00:42.040
3.8 though, I believe is four years old, Joe.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.240
That is a big important upgrade, if nothing else.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.000
It was long overdue.

00:47.000 --> 00:52.080
And they said that going forward, they intend to never have to relive this process again.

00:52.080 --> 00:59.000
Yeah, they intend to hopefully rebase frequently, which seems like a very good plan to me because

00:59.000 --> 01:04.380
you don't want to leave it that long, where it's an impossible task and it just gets harder

01:04.380 --> 01:05.380
and harder.

01:05.380 --> 01:09.580
I recently had a chat with Michael Hall on Linux Unplugged about Endless and what they're

01:09.580 --> 01:10.580
up to.

01:10.580 --> 01:13.740
And if you're not familiar, because they are kind of new, it's an interesting project.

01:13.740 --> 01:18.840
They're trying to take a Gnome Shell based desktop and make it work offline a little

01:18.840 --> 01:19.840
better.

01:19.840 --> 01:22.980
They want to preload it with content, preload it with existing data and make it work in

01:22.980 --> 01:28.400
regions that don't have always on internet, which honestly is even some places here in

01:28.400 --> 01:32.000
the United States, one of the places Michael Hall mentioned that they might be looking

01:32.000 --> 01:37.180
to move into in the future is jails, which if you think about it is a great use case,

01:37.180 --> 01:42.260
something that is secure, that is easy to use and works well offline, but also in countries

01:42.260 --> 01:44.300
that don't have proper internet connection.

01:44.300 --> 01:46.580
And so they're working on some interesting special stuff.

01:46.580 --> 01:51.660
And one of the other reasons that I pay some close attention to it is folks from the original

01:51.660 --> 01:54.140
Gnome days are working on this stuff.

01:54.140 --> 01:59.700
But you know, I kind of feel this is just not aimed at me because I have a solid internet

01:59.700 --> 02:03.620
connection almost all the time and I'm not a new user.

02:03.620 --> 02:07.500
So for me, I only really have an academic interest in this.

02:07.500 --> 02:11.300
I think I kind of am in the same boat myself.

02:11.300 --> 02:13.060
I really don't see myself using this.

02:13.060 --> 02:17.540
Plus, I don't really see myself using something that legs a release or two behind Gnome.

02:17.540 --> 02:21.140
I'm much more likely to want to use something that's pretty current.

02:21.140 --> 02:25.800
And I'm still waiting to see the actual code go upstream.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.540
There's a lot of talk about upstream and they say their intention is to reduce the difference

02:29.540 --> 02:31.720
with upstream as much as possible.

02:31.720 --> 02:35.260
And they're going to upstream everything they can as far as it makes sense for them to do

02:35.260 --> 02:38.600
so, which I'm not quite sure what that means, but I believe them.

02:38.600 --> 02:43.180
And they have pushed patches a few years ago when they first made that big switch with

02:43.180 --> 02:44.180
Gnome 3.8.

02:44.180 --> 02:47.940
But I don't think there's been a lot of code that's gone upstream since then.

02:47.940 --> 02:49.980
So maybe we'll see some of that.

02:49.980 --> 02:53.220
Part of that would be, of course, being based on a more modern version of Gnome Shell.

02:53.220 --> 02:55.740
So that way their upstream patches were more relevant.

02:55.740 --> 03:00.740
Yeah, it's one thing to offer your patches upstream, but it's another for them to be

03:00.740 --> 03:01.740
accepted.

03:01.740 --> 03:04.540
And it does look like they have some good ideas here.

03:04.540 --> 03:08.380
So if they can stay current, there may be some stuff that the Gnome project might want

03:08.380 --> 03:09.380
to take a look at.

03:09.380 --> 03:16.260
Yeah, I think that for new users, it's good having the kind of phone-based icons and stuff.

03:16.260 --> 03:20.700
Because a lot of people in developing countries never used laptops.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.580
They went straight to the mobile experience.

03:22.580 --> 03:28.420
And so it kind of makes sense to have more of a mobile-like experience on a laptop.

03:28.420 --> 03:33.540
But if you've been using computers for years and years and years and are used to the kind

03:33.540 --> 03:39.060
of traditional way of doing things, then this is just pushing it way more beyond even what

03:39.060 --> 03:43.040
Gnome is into just pure mobile territory, basically.

03:43.040 --> 03:45.380
It does feel a bit like a productized version of Gnome.

03:45.380 --> 03:49.580
And going back to your earlier comment about it being an academic fascination, that's what

03:49.580 --> 03:50.580
it is for me.

03:50.580 --> 03:53.860
It's like, what if a company got together that knows Gnome that could build something

03:53.860 --> 03:57.900
using OS tree and flat packs, and they could really deliver a product?

03:57.900 --> 03:58.900
What would it be?

03:58.900 --> 03:59.900
Well, this is it.

03:59.900 --> 04:03.580
We're seeing that experimentation play out right here with Endless.

04:03.580 --> 04:09.580
And maybe, maybe once they start getting some traction and more and more users start using

04:09.580 --> 04:13.980
this stuff in production, some of these ideas will just work their way in.

04:13.980 --> 04:18.180
Even if it's not code, if it's the concepts, might work their way into mainline Gnome Shell.

04:18.180 --> 04:23.080
If you look at a screenshot of this thing, it looks like Windows 10 met Gnome Shell to

04:23.080 --> 04:24.080
some degree.

04:24.080 --> 04:28.380
Sounds like budgie to me.

04:28.380 --> 04:33.380
Speaking of laptops, German laptop company Tuxedo is announcing its own Ubuntu flavor.

04:33.380 --> 04:34.940
It's the season of distros, Joe.

04:34.940 --> 04:37.180
Yeah, it seems to be the in thing.

04:37.180 --> 04:43.260
If you are a Linux hardware seller, you should make your own distro because that's definitely

04:43.260 --> 04:44.620
a good idea, right?

04:44.620 --> 04:46.420
I would put a caveat next to that.

04:46.420 --> 04:51.260
If you are a Linux hardware vendor who apparently doesn't sell enough units, I don't know what

04:51.260 --> 04:55.780
Tuxedo sales are, but doesn't sell enough units to participate with an OEM program so

04:55.780 --> 04:58.980
that way Canonical just makes these changes for you, you're forced to do this.

04:58.980 --> 05:01.140
Might be another way to phrase that.

05:01.140 --> 05:02.760
Yeah.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.500
So we talked about Pop OS, didn't we, from System76?

05:05.500 --> 05:09.500
Never heard of it.

05:09.500 --> 05:16.540
So this time it's called Tuxedo Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, got to get the whole thing in there.

05:16.540 --> 05:21.300
Yeah, which if I was going to make a distro, that's what I'd base it on because that's

05:21.300 --> 05:22.460
what I use.

05:22.460 --> 05:25.860
I'm sitting here looking at Ubuntu 16.04 right now.

05:25.860 --> 05:30.060
Yeah, except it's not really Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, is it?

05:30.060 --> 05:33.060
Because it's using a totally different kernel.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.860
It's shipping with different proprietary firmware blobs.

05:35.860 --> 05:41.980
It ships with the NVIDIA proprietary driver when necessary, adjustments on the grub, quote

05:41.980 --> 05:48.360
unquote, and optimizations to other system-relevant files and their own theme, which you could

05:48.360 --> 05:53.600
almost describe as a lacquer level of painting, and their own logos.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.940
This is not really Ubuntu.

05:55.940 --> 05:58.060
This is something else.

05:58.060 --> 05:59.380
This is a modification of it.

05:59.380 --> 06:03.740
In fact, to me, it's almost nonsensical to put Ubuntu 16.04 LTS because what part of

06:03.740 --> 06:04.840
that is LTS?

06:04.840 --> 06:06.800
What part of that is being maintained by Canonical?

06:06.800 --> 06:10.280
Not the kernel, not the relevant system files, not grub.

06:10.280 --> 06:13.620
So it's not really an LTS 16.04 Ubuntu anything.

06:13.620 --> 06:18.080
Yeah, and Martin Winpress talked about this on the Ubuntu podcast, didn't he, about he

06:18.080 --> 06:24.120
got a version of Ubuntu Mate on a review unit from Tuxedo, and they had just completely

06:24.120 --> 06:25.220
butchered it.

06:25.220 --> 06:29.660
All the trouble that Wimpy ran into was all justified in the name of improving the customer

06:29.660 --> 06:30.660
experience.

06:30.660 --> 06:35.280
And the one that they love to throw around with this new release is they took a Infinity

06:35.280 --> 06:40.740
Book Pro 13, and they put Linux Mint 18.1 on there.

06:40.740 --> 06:43.740
That got six hours of battery life.

06:43.740 --> 06:49.660
Then they took their fancy Zubuntu fork on the same Ultrabook and got nearly twice the

06:49.660 --> 06:55.780
battery life with almost 12 hours of battery performance just by swapping out the distro,

06:55.780 --> 06:56.780
Joe.

06:56.780 --> 06:58.420
Are you sure they didn't turn the brightness down as well?

06:58.420 --> 07:04.340
I think it has more to do with the kernel 4.11 that they swapped out to, those optimizations

07:04.340 --> 07:08.700
to system relevant files, and the fact that I think they ran PowerTop and then just put

07:08.700 --> 07:10.420
it in automatic mode.

07:10.420 --> 07:11.420
Yeah.

07:11.420 --> 07:14.220
Well, and Linux Mint as well.

07:14.220 --> 07:19.320
That's not a distro I would choose to use for pretty much anything, I'm afraid.

07:19.320 --> 07:21.980
There's been so much going on, Joe, with all of this stuff.

07:21.980 --> 07:22.980
Like you mentioned, you have Pop!

07:22.980 --> 07:24.260
OS, you have Tuxedo going on.

07:24.260 --> 07:25.720
Of course, Linux Mint is out there.

07:25.720 --> 07:32.100
So it is interesting to get some data, some actual user data on laptops from the Linux

07:32.100 --> 07:33.380
community right now.

07:33.380 --> 07:37.460
Ferronics has published the 2017 Linux laptop survey results.

07:37.460 --> 07:40.500
They've had 30,171 responses.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.500
So it's a lot of data.

07:41.500 --> 07:42.780
You could draw different conclusions.

07:42.780 --> 07:46.660
You can't necessarily say it's scientific, but it is pretty interesting.

07:46.660 --> 07:51.960
Well, Tuxedo are concerned with battery life, but it seems that most people who run Linux

07:51.960 --> 07:57.420
on their laptop aren't because that came out pretty much bottom of the list of what people

07:57.420 --> 07:58.420
want.

07:58.420 --> 08:03.080
Yeah, it was fourth in the survey, beat out by build quality, performance, and even being

08:03.080 --> 08:05.180
preloaded with Linux.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.760
Yeah.

08:06.760 --> 08:10.960
And not many people buy machines preloaded with Linux, it seems still.

08:10.960 --> 08:16.140
Only 10% of the respondents said that their most recent laptop came preloaded with Linux.

08:16.140 --> 08:17.140
That surprised me a lot.

08:17.140 --> 08:21.180
Yeah, because now we've got Dell machines, we've got all sorts of Linux vendors.

08:21.180 --> 08:24.020
So you'd expect that number to be higher, I think.

08:24.020 --> 08:28.360
But people are just stuck in a ways with their ThinkPads, it looks like.

08:28.360 --> 08:31.420
They actually did break down the data amongst the different laptops.

08:31.420 --> 08:35.380
And yeah, Lenovo was the number one hardware by quite a bit.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.040
Lenovo really did pretty good.

08:37.040 --> 08:43.860
Dell came in at second, Asus at third, HP fourth, Apple and Acer came in tied for fifth.

08:43.860 --> 08:50.740
System 76 was the most popular dedicated Linux system provider, but it was only used by 2.1%

08:50.740 --> 08:52.740
of the respondents.

08:52.740 --> 08:53.740
That's a...

08:53.740 --> 08:57.820
See, the reason why that surprised me, Joe, is this isn't a survey of the market of consumers

08:57.820 --> 09:00.520
interested in buying computers.

09:00.520 --> 09:05.460
This is a survey of Linux enthusiasts that want to buy Linux computers, or computers

09:05.460 --> 09:06.900
to run Linux.

09:06.900 --> 09:13.620
So why is it that companies like System 76 are so low on surveys like this?

09:13.620 --> 09:15.540
You suppose it could be store availability?

09:15.540 --> 09:18.740
You know, Lenovo is in just about every electronics store here in the States.

09:18.740 --> 09:20.660
Yeah, and Amazon and stuff, yeah.

09:20.660 --> 09:21.660
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

09:21.660 --> 09:24.380
Amazon, I bet you a big part of it is purchases on Amazon.

09:24.380 --> 09:29.520
Dell, same thing, Dell is available in a lot of retail locations, also available online.

09:29.520 --> 09:34.380
Apple not performing that strongly, even though all of those same things are true to Apple.

09:34.380 --> 09:35.380
Not too surprising, though.

09:35.380 --> 09:38.900
If you're going to buy a MacBook, you're probably not buying it with the intention to run Linux

09:38.900 --> 09:40.220
full time.

09:40.220 --> 09:42.200
Some are, though, in this response.

09:42.200 --> 09:48.900
So keeping the context of Pop OS and Tuxedo's Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, it is interesting then to

09:48.900 --> 09:53.300
discuss what the most popular distros were in respondents.

09:53.300 --> 09:55.340
You're probably not going to be too surprised by this one.

09:55.340 --> 10:02.420
Ubuntu was the most popular Linux distribution, running on 39.9% of the respondents' laptops.

10:02.420 --> 10:05.740
Second place was Arch Linux, followed by Debian.

10:05.740 --> 10:11.020
And then rounding out the top 10 was Fedora at 14, Linux Mint came in at fifth, and then

10:11.020 --> 10:15.500
OpenSUSE trailing in at 4%, Gentoo 3.9.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.700
Just wow, look at this, Solus actually clocked in.

10:17.700 --> 10:22.420
Good for Solus, clocking in at 2%, which is not bad for a brand new distro.

10:22.420 --> 10:23.420
Yeah.

10:23.420 --> 10:27.420
It does make me wonder how many people are actually running Arch and Debian, rather than

10:27.420 --> 10:30.540
just saying that they're running Arch and Debian, and Gentoo as well.

10:30.540 --> 10:34.060
Surely 3.9% of people can't actually be running Gentoo.

10:34.060 --> 10:35.060
I believe it.

10:35.060 --> 10:36.060
I believe it.

10:36.060 --> 10:37.060
I do believe it.

10:37.060 --> 10:40.260
I also think it's interesting that Solus almost has half the market share of SUSE already.

10:40.260 --> 10:41.260
Yeah.

10:41.260 --> 10:42.260
That is interesting.

10:42.260 --> 10:43.260
But I don't know.

10:43.260 --> 10:49.220
We always say that SUSE is popular in Germany, but maybe the kind of people who run it don't

10:49.220 --> 10:52.140
speak English and don't read sites like Pharaonyx, maybe.

10:52.140 --> 10:53.140
Yeah.

10:53.140 --> 10:54.140
This is what I was thinking.

10:54.140 --> 10:55.140
Yeah.

10:55.140 --> 10:56.420
Well, it wasn't just ran by Pharaonyx.

10:56.420 --> 10:57.580
Actually, he was lucky.

10:57.580 --> 10:59.580
A lot of places did pick it up.

10:59.580 --> 11:01.220
I saw it spread out wide and far.

11:01.220 --> 11:03.900
So he did get a good reach beyond just the Pharaonyx website.

11:03.900 --> 11:06.540
But yeah, I think it was still mostly English outlets.

11:06.540 --> 11:07.540
Yeah.

11:07.540 --> 11:09.940
But yeah, good for Solus, 2%.

11:09.940 --> 11:11.460
I'm sure Archie will be happy with that one.

11:11.460 --> 11:13.500
I'd probably want 80% knowing him.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.500
Yeah.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.500
Yeah, of course.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.500
Of course.

11:16.500 --> 11:20.700
You got to have all the numbers.

11:20.700 --> 11:23.580
Last.ting.com, go there before I get them to change that URL.

11:23.580 --> 11:26.500
Go there when it was still cool and save money on your mobile plan.

11:26.500 --> 11:29.620
It's really how mobile should have been done from day one in the States.

11:29.620 --> 11:33.800
They take your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes, and whatever you use, that's

11:33.800 --> 11:34.800
what you pay.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.820
Each line is just a $6 line.

11:36.820 --> 11:37.820
And then it's just your usage.

11:37.820 --> 11:39.860
So if you want three phones, you just pay six for each line.

11:39.860 --> 11:41.460
You want to add a fourth, it's $6.

11:41.460 --> 11:43.720
I love this plan for small businesses too.

11:43.720 --> 11:48.180
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

11:48.180 --> 11:53.580
Last.ting.com will take $25 off a device, or if you bring one, and they have a CDMA

11:53.580 --> 11:57.960
and GSM network, they'll give you $25 in service credit, and it just might pay for more than

11:57.960 --> 11:59.060
your first month.

11:59.060 --> 12:03.460
No contracts, no early termination fees, and it's really simple to use with great customer

12:03.460 --> 12:05.340
service nationwide coverage.

12:05.340 --> 12:11.900
Just pay for what you use, last.ting.com.

12:11.900 --> 12:16.660
So the big news in the UK this week is that people are starting to finally get their Mycroft

12:16.660 --> 12:25.940
devices, including the voice, or well, the alleged voice of Mycroft, Alan Pope, who received

12:25.940 --> 12:31.200
his and asked it a couple of questions and filmed the results.

12:31.200 --> 12:34.780
And funny is one way to look at it.

12:34.780 --> 12:35.780
Tragic is another.

12:35.780 --> 12:36.780
Yeah.

12:36.780 --> 12:37.780
Yeah.

12:37.780 --> 12:38.780
You know, we knew this moment was coming, Joe.

12:38.780 --> 12:42.380
We knew eventually the public was going to get their hands on this thing, and it was

12:42.380 --> 12:48.060
either going to be surprisingly good, or it was going to be awkwardly bad, and a friend

12:48.060 --> 12:51.660
of the show, Alan Pope, decided to ask Mycroft, what are beans?

12:51.660 --> 12:55.460
Hey, Mycroft, what are beans?

12:55.460 --> 13:00.740
And then a very long, awkward pause of silence.

13:00.740 --> 13:01.740
It's thinking, Joe.

13:01.740 --> 13:02.740
It's thinking.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.740
Hard, apparently.

13:05.740 --> 13:06.740
Still thinking, Joe.

13:06.740 --> 13:16.900
Beans serve in size 130g, total calories 132, fat calories 4%, daily value caret asterisk,

13:16.900 --> 13:29.180
total fat 433 mg, 1%, saturated fat 61 mg, 0%, trans fat, cholesterol 0g, 0%, sodium

13:29.180 --> 13:42.180
264 mg, 11%, total carbohydrates 25g, 8%, dietary fiber 7g, 97%, sugar 1g, protein 8g,

13:42.180 --> 13:59.140
10%, vitamin C 5%, calcium 5%, iron 14%, thiamine 14%, vitamin B 6, 8%, folate 9%,

13:59.140 --> 14:08.260
phosphorus 10%, magnesium 12%, zinc 5%, asterisk percent, daily values are based on 2,000 calories

14:08.260 --> 14:11.700
averaged over different types of prepared beans.

14:11.700 --> 14:12.700
Oh, that's better.

14:12.700 --> 14:17.060
Are you still talking?

14:17.060 --> 14:23.300
Oh, that is a bad show right there.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.380
Yeah.

14:24.380 --> 14:28.340
And there's a bunch of other videos which are fairly, I think that's probably the worst

14:28.340 --> 14:36.740
of it, but it's just compared with Alexa or Google Home, I mean, it's just, it's light

14:36.740 --> 14:37.740
years behind.

14:37.740 --> 14:38.740
Yeah, yeah.

14:38.740 --> 14:41.580
You know, if we were going to break this problem down, though, we have two things.

14:41.580 --> 14:46.540
So we have the hardware, which is Raspberry Pi based right now, and the industrial design,

14:46.540 --> 14:48.860
and the way the information is displayed on the device.

14:48.860 --> 14:53.940
I'm actually going to give it a good solid pass on all of those things.

14:53.940 --> 14:55.620
I think the industrial design looks pretty good.

14:55.620 --> 14:59.780
I like the way that the volume is represented by a light ring around the eyeballs.

14:59.780 --> 15:02.380
So the physical product, pretty good.

15:02.380 --> 15:08.060
Now, the problem is the cloud backend that actually makes that product usable seems pretty

15:08.060 --> 15:09.060
horrible.

15:09.060 --> 15:12.300
And when Mycroft, the company, was contacted about this, they say that they still have

15:12.300 --> 15:16.980
a lot of work to do in order to improve the wake word recognition and concede that the

15:16.980 --> 15:23.180
voice user experience is still young and the skills that have been developed need significant

15:23.180 --> 15:24.180
refinement.

15:24.180 --> 15:27.300
That's a bit of an understatement.

15:27.300 --> 15:28.300
Yeah.

15:28.300 --> 15:29.300
Yeah.

15:29.300 --> 15:30.300
You're right about the look of it.

15:30.300 --> 15:34.980
And yeah, do check out the YouTube videos that Popey made, we'll have links to them.

15:34.980 --> 15:36.220
It looks good.

15:36.220 --> 15:38.300
My wife said, oh, it looks really cute.

15:38.300 --> 15:43.460
And you know, I can see people liking that, but yeah, just the software in it, I don't

15:43.460 --> 15:48.100
know to what extent it's the software in the actual device, because that's got to have

15:48.100 --> 15:53.580
some bearing on the delay there, because there's an awfully long delay while I was thinking

15:53.580 --> 15:56.620
about how to process your request.

15:56.620 --> 15:59.980
But the thing is that even some of the backend stuff is proprietary, so you can't just say

15:59.980 --> 16:06.460
that it's not just because it's open source that that's the problem.

16:06.460 --> 16:10.580
To me, this is a very poor advert for all things free and open source.

16:10.580 --> 16:13.600
Yeah, this is one of those stories that you hope doesn't get around.

16:13.600 --> 16:16.820
You don't want to see this at the top of TechCrunch tomorrow.

16:16.820 --> 16:20.500
This is one of those things where we hope we can just quietly work on while everybody

16:20.500 --> 16:25.880
else like the Echo and the Google Home and the HomePod have their day in the sun.

16:25.880 --> 16:30.540
The reality is, is we're way behind here, open sources, and this is a new frontier for

16:30.540 --> 16:35.700
us because it involves so much data, so much processing, it requires incredible network

16:35.700 --> 16:38.100
connectivity and infrastructure.

16:38.100 --> 16:41.700
This has got to be one of the biggest challenges that consumer open source is going to be facing

16:41.700 --> 16:42.700
in a long time.

16:42.700 --> 16:45.340
Well, is it or is it just going to be forgotten about?

16:45.340 --> 16:51.620
I don't know, because I'd have a lot more sympathy for Mycroft as a company if they

16:51.620 --> 16:53.360
had delivered more quickly.

16:53.360 --> 16:59.780
They did two crowd funders and we've waited how long, over a year, and this is the result

16:59.780 --> 17:01.180
of it.

17:01.180 --> 17:05.100
If it had been delivered more quickly as a developer device, and it says it's rough around

17:05.100 --> 17:12.780
the edges and all that kind of stuff, cause itself a prototype, but if it was quicker

17:12.780 --> 17:16.780
I'd have more sympathy, and I'd have more sympathy with them taking so long if it was

17:16.780 --> 17:19.940
better, but you can't have both, can you?

17:19.940 --> 17:25.740
It's like that whole thing about do you want it quick, cheap, or good, and you pick two,

17:25.740 --> 17:31.500
and they've done it slowly and badly, and it wasn't particularly cheap either.

17:31.500 --> 17:35.480
Maybe they could follow the Sailfish model and just keep keeping at it, because eventually

17:35.480 --> 17:39.680
you end up with an Intel based tablet that runs Sailfish OS and Android support up on

17:39.680 --> 17:41.260
IndieGoGo Joe.

17:41.260 --> 17:48.060
Yeah, so we spoke about this, didn't we, a few weeks ago, how there was an update for

17:48.060 --> 17:53.700
the first Yola tablet running Sailfish OS, which was a crowd funder and then was never

17:53.700 --> 17:57.140
delivered and people still are waiting for their refunds.

17:57.140 --> 18:07.220
Well a new Sailfish tablet has appeared on IndieGoGo from a company called Uyota, something

18:07.220 --> 18:12.980
like that, and it looks remarkably similar to the other tablet, doesn't it, in terms

18:12.980 --> 18:19.820
of specs and even the design of it, and it just seems like, for me once, shame on you.

18:19.820 --> 18:23.940
I don't know, would you even consider backing this IndieGoGo?

18:23.940 --> 18:28.260
Didn't even cross my mind for a hot second, which is interesting because back in the day

18:28.260 --> 18:32.380
I think I might have, and I'm even kind of impressed by the specs, I'm willing to consider

18:32.380 --> 18:36.740
an x86 tablet because the upsides are pretty high if it actually worked, and this thing

18:36.740 --> 18:44.500
has a quad core, 1.8GHz processor, 32GB or 64GB of storage, 2GB of DDR3L RAM, it's got

18:44.500 --> 18:50.040
a 7.85 inch IPS display with a 330 pixel density, which is nice.

18:50.040 --> 18:54.900
It's a good looking rig, really, I just didn't even consider for a hot second backing this

18:54.900 --> 18:55.900
thing.

18:55.900 --> 19:00.140
Yeah, the thing about it being x86 is you've got a remote chance, at least, of being able

19:00.140 --> 19:03.740
to run GNU slash Linux on it if it doesn't work out.

19:03.740 --> 19:05.760
Yeah, you've got that backup plan.

19:05.760 --> 19:11.140
It looks nice though, and if I was confident that they were going to deliver, then I might

19:11.140 --> 19:15.420
seriously consider it because I would like to get my hands on a Sailfish tablet, and

19:15.420 --> 19:23.100
of the other OSs, the other Linux based mobile OSs, I would say Sailfish is by far the best,

19:23.100 --> 19:24.900
and that's probably why it's the only one that survived.

19:24.900 --> 19:29.140
Yeah, I completely agree, I think you're right on all points, and the fact that you can run

19:29.140 --> 19:33.340
Android applications on this thing sort of gives you the peace of mind that there's going

19:33.340 --> 19:36.120
to be right out of the box things you can do with it.

19:36.120 --> 19:43.220
Pricing on the Indiegogo starts at $199 with an estimated September 2017 ship day, then

19:43.220 --> 19:47.580
it bumps up from there, if you say you want to get 64 gigs, you're looking at $220.

19:47.580 --> 19:49.300
These are not bad prices.

19:49.300 --> 19:56.540
Not bad prices and very quick delivery for an Indiegogo, if that actually doesn't slip,

19:56.540 --> 19:57.660
but we'll see.

19:57.660 --> 20:00.880
When I see those dates and I see these prices, this tells me that this is hardware that's

20:00.880 --> 20:04.740
already manufactured, and it's a matter of just refining the OS to work on it properly.

20:04.740 --> 20:07.100
Yeah, and it's hit its goal.

20:07.100 --> 20:08.740
They smashed through it in just a few days.

20:08.740 --> 20:14.980
They wanted $50,000 and they've got $67,000 now, and they seem to be getting more and

20:14.980 --> 20:15.980
more backers all the time.

20:15.980 --> 20:17.700
Yeah, 12 days left still too.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.720
Yeah, and it's quite a short campaign as well.

20:19.720 --> 20:25.220
They obviously are looking to turn this around as quickly as possible, and one of the things

20:25.220 --> 20:30.820
they want the money for is to officially license Sailfish, because that's what Yola are trying

20:30.820 --> 20:31.820
to do now, aren't they?

20:31.820 --> 20:34.020
That's their business model.

20:34.020 --> 20:39.060
And suddenly the blog post that we reported on a couple of weeks ago makes sense how they

20:39.060 --> 20:45.980
were planning to make some money from their licensing agreements and give that back to

20:45.980 --> 20:48.020
the original backers.

20:48.020 --> 20:53.420
So it seems like, I'm not going to say Robin Peter to pay Paul, but it's kind of like the

20:53.420 --> 20:58.180
people who are backing this tablet are going to be paying back the people who backed the

20:58.180 --> 21:00.860
last one kind of indirectly.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.980
So that all makes sense now.

21:02.980 --> 21:05.020
Yeah, that is a good observation.

21:05.020 --> 21:09.380
And also something else I noticed is they believe that they're going to be able to ship

21:09.380 --> 21:14.340
these things 45 days after they start assembling, and they're going to do assembly in Foxconn.

21:14.340 --> 21:20.420
These are solid numbers and locations, which means this is a pretty sure bet, and yet still

21:20.420 --> 21:21.420
not backing it.

21:21.420 --> 21:22.660
I just want to see it ship.

21:22.660 --> 21:24.540
I want to see it ship for a little while.

21:24.540 --> 21:25.700
Then maybe I'll consider it.

21:25.700 --> 21:30.500
Yeah, I mean, if they can actually deliver this, they're going to make some reasonable

21:30.500 --> 21:36.020
money, and then people will be more filled with confidence.

21:36.020 --> 21:38.140
And I think people will buy it.

21:38.140 --> 21:43.780
And I would consider it at that point, because my tablets are getting a bit long in the teeth.

21:43.780 --> 21:47.740
And you would hope that there might be lineage available for it.

21:47.740 --> 21:53.140
And maybe some kind of GNU slash Linux, as I said, so it seems like a fair proposition.

21:53.140 --> 21:57.980
And this keyboard that comes with as an option looks quite nice as well.

21:57.980 --> 21:58.980
They call it a two-in-one.

21:58.980 --> 22:01.900
I think that's a little bit...

22:01.900 --> 22:05.860
It's not really fair to call a case with a keyboard addition a two-in-one, but it still

22:05.860 --> 22:06.860
looks pretty cool.

22:06.860 --> 22:11.500
And if they wanted to send me one for free, I would be all over it, but I'm not risking

22:11.500 --> 22:13.060
200 bucks on this, I'm afraid.

22:13.060 --> 22:17.980
Yeah, I'll wait for a couple of reviews, and then maybe I'll grab one and we'll do a review.

22:17.980 --> 22:19.380
But yeah, I do agree with you.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.260
It looks like a good product if they can ship it.

22:21.260 --> 22:25.660
And Sailfish OS is one of my favorite alternative mobile operating systems.

22:25.660 --> 22:30.020
Yeah, I quite like Tizen as well, and I haven't used that for a long time, so I can only assume

22:30.020 --> 22:31.460
it's got better.

22:31.460 --> 22:35.340
But yeah, Firefox OS was a bit DOA, really.

22:35.340 --> 22:39.300
And then we know what happened with Ubuntu Touch.

22:39.300 --> 22:41.300
Too soon, Joe, too soon.

22:41.300 --> 22:45.220
All right, let's talk about Mozilla.

22:45.220 --> 22:46.220
What are they up to?

22:46.220 --> 22:48.700
What are they spending their Yahoo billions on this week?

22:48.700 --> 22:52.140
Well, we've been wondering where they're going to go and how they're going to stay relevant.

22:52.140 --> 22:56.060
And Mozilla has announced its own Project Things framework designed to pull together

22:56.060 --> 23:01.180
existing Web of Things specifications and code under a global framework comprised of

23:01.180 --> 23:03.500
device, gateway, and cloud components.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.300
We've got too many standards, Chris.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.500
We need another one.

23:06.500 --> 23:12.500
This is sort of like the omni layer that sits on top of Google standards, Microsoft's, Amazon's,

23:12.500 --> 23:16.940
Apple's, and Samsung's, which gets a huge cross section.

23:16.940 --> 23:21.900
And this stuff is so fragmented because each vendor has their own application protocol.

23:21.900 --> 23:26.900
Google has Weave, Amazon has MQTT, Apple has HomeKit.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.520
They have network protocols.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.780
Most of them speak Wi-Fi to some degree.

23:30.780 --> 23:33.820
Some of them do Bluetooth and other things running over Bluetooth.

23:33.820 --> 23:36.820
And then, of course, there's the operating systems that most of these devices are powered

23:36.820 --> 23:43.140
by, Linux or Android of Things, Windows IoT, which nobody really uses, iOS for the HomeKit

23:43.140 --> 23:49.780
stuff, and Linux or Android or a mix for like a lot of the Samsung stuff and the Wemo products

23:49.780 --> 23:51.260
from Belkin.

23:51.260 --> 23:56.020
There's just a crap ton of mess, lots of different standards, tons of fragmentation.

23:56.020 --> 24:00.900
And what Mozilla wants to do is put a layer that sits on top of all this stuff and essentially

24:00.900 --> 24:06.700
gives each device a web-like URL that anything can talk.

24:06.700 --> 24:12.340
You know that old phrase about if all you've got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail?

24:12.340 --> 24:14.460
I kind of feel that way about Mozilla.

24:14.460 --> 24:18.020
To them, all they have is the web.

24:18.020 --> 24:21.100
And so that's the solution to every problem is the web.

24:21.100 --> 24:27.420
They say that the goal is creating a decentralized Internet of Things by giving things URLs on

24:27.420 --> 24:32.820
the web to make them linkable and discoverable and by defining a standard data model and

24:32.820 --> 24:34.140
APIs to make them interoperable.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.140
But do you know what I mean?

24:36.140 --> 24:37.980
Look at the phone, right?

24:37.980 --> 24:39.520
What was the solution to the phone?

24:39.520 --> 24:43.780
Make it basically web technologies and that didn't work out.

24:43.780 --> 24:49.660
So they're just constantly pushing this and I don't know whether that is the solution.

24:49.660 --> 24:53.540
I think that open standards are always good.

24:53.540 --> 25:00.380
And I think that Mozilla, I like to poke fun at them and everything, but of anyone to be

25:00.380 --> 25:04.980
in charge of this stuff and pushing standards in this area, Mozilla is a company who, well,

25:04.980 --> 25:08.340
an organization that I am happy to do that.

25:08.340 --> 25:12.980
But I just wonder if this is necessarily the right approach.

25:12.980 --> 25:18.100
I don't really have any alternative approaches to offer, so maybe I shouldn't be criticizing

25:18.100 --> 25:19.100
it.

25:19.100 --> 25:21.580
Well, you know, the Linux Foundation does.

25:21.580 --> 25:25.460
There is something the Linux Foundation and Dell and a lot of other vendors have been

25:25.460 --> 25:30.540
working on now for a couple of months that is essentially this, also runs on Raspberry

25:30.540 --> 25:33.220
Pis like the early prototypes of this do.

25:33.220 --> 25:34.220
So we'll see.

25:34.220 --> 25:35.780
They are a little late to this game.

25:35.780 --> 25:41.500
See, the issue is the problem is already here and this needed to be here, I would say a

25:41.500 --> 25:43.660
year or two ago, to be honest with you.

25:43.660 --> 25:49.160
And like you said, it is cramming web technologies into an IoT solution.

25:49.160 --> 25:53.840
The reason why I mentioned that again is this area, these Internet of Things devices, it's

25:53.840 --> 25:57.340
all super crap cheap hardware that doesn't have a lot of room for overhead.

25:57.340 --> 26:01.700
So this software that Mozilla is releasing is implemented in JavaScript.

26:01.700 --> 26:06.940
It runs on a Node.js web server and then you put that on a Raspberry Pi.

26:06.940 --> 26:12.120
And they're also working on, now they are aware that non-web languages are important,

26:12.120 --> 26:15.540
but the things they have on their priority list don't really feel like they apply to

26:15.540 --> 26:20.060
Microsoft and Apple and Samsung because when they go to cite other programming languages

26:20.060 --> 26:22.380
they might support in the future, they list Rust.

26:22.380 --> 26:26.780
I love Rust, but Amazon doesn't love Rust, Apple doesn't love Rust, Microsoft doesn't

26:26.780 --> 26:28.440
love Rust, Samsung, they don't care.

26:28.440 --> 26:32.180
So if you're going to try to build in support, maybe go for something the rest of the market's

26:32.180 --> 26:33.180
using.

26:33.180 --> 26:36.420
Yeah, why not do it properly with something low level like C?

26:36.420 --> 26:40.780
Right, something that you would eek the most performance out of would be what I would think.

26:40.780 --> 26:44.220
Now this is a management layer, so I kind of get it, and you want something people can

26:44.220 --> 26:47.660
write to, but it's just more lacquer on top of lacquer.

26:47.660 --> 26:49.660
That's my theme today.

26:49.660 --> 26:56.860
Yeah, well, Mozilla, bless them, they have to keep trying to be relevant somehow, don't

26:56.860 --> 27:01.140
they, and it's not really working out on the desktop, so it makes sense that they'd go

27:01.140 --> 27:05.180
after the IoT because that's the new hotness, isn't it?

27:05.180 --> 27:08.160
That's where everything's going, supposedly.

27:08.160 --> 27:11.820
And this problem that we just went through, it does underscore the fact that standardization

27:11.820 --> 27:12.820
needs to happen here.

27:12.820 --> 27:17.260
You're not going to have stuff securely implemented and maintained unless something like this

27:17.260 --> 27:19.700
comes along, I would like it to be Mozilla.

27:19.700 --> 27:22.020
Yeah, I wouldn't mind it being canonical, to be honest.

27:22.020 --> 27:26.380
I know they've got this big push, and okay, they've made some mistakes in the past, but

27:26.380 --> 27:30.100
they've always been really good at open sourcing everything, even if it takes them a while,

27:30.100 --> 27:31.820
like with Ubuntu 1.

27:31.820 --> 27:37.900
So I wouldn't mind them, I wouldn't mind Mozilla, as long as we have open standards, that's

27:37.900 --> 27:39.620
all that really matters.

27:39.620 --> 27:41.300
