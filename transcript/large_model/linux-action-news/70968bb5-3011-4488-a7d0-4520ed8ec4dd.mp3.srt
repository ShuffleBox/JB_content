00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,160
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,920
This is episode 101, recorded on April 14th, 2019. I'm Chris.

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,920
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,580
Hello, Joe. Good to be connected with you. Let's start things out with a bunch of news

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,560
that came out of Google Cloud Next. Let's just bust through some of this.

6
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,680
All right. Let's start with Anthos. I think that's how you say it, which is the new name

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,300
of the Google Cloud Services Platform. And it's not just a rebrand, is it?

8
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,780
It's Google Cloud Services Platform, but not as you know it. Google has decided to give

9
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:48,440
the service a new name, Anthos, but they've also expanded support to AWS and Azure. Yeah,

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,980
you heard that right. It's competitors. They have decided that the way to win when you're

11
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,860
the underdog is by supporting the competition. This will allow enterprises to use a single

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:03,640
platform running on Google's cloud to deploy and manage their applications on any other

13
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,140
cloud. The advantage really here is that enterprises get a single bill and have a single dashboard

14
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,920
to manage all of their applications. And surprise, surprise, it's all powered by Kubernetes.

15
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,600
It's Google's attempt at hybrid cloud, isn't it? Maybe they've been looking over at the

16
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,480
IBM Red Hat acquisition thinking, hmm, people don't want to be locked into one particular

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:31,000
cloud service provider. They want to be able to hedge their bets a little bit. And this

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,860
seems like a very good strategy to me. It seems like you can't compete with AWS if you

19
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,640
just do the same thing they're doing. You need to do something different. And what better

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,120
way than to say, hey, you're not totally locked into us, even though I get the feeling that

21
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,720
you kind of might be.

22
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Well, I mean, if you get hooked on that nice dashboard sauce, I think you would be. Google

23
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,140
says that this is from their Google Cloud CEO, Thomas Korane, I think is how you say

24
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,280
his last name. He said that customers are coming to them and saying, Google, Google,

25
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,720
please give us an integrated solution that solves this problem. It's too much. And let's

26
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,600
be honest, there is probably some truth there because IBM didn't buy Red Hat for no reason

27
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:18,600
at all. Hybrid, integrated, multi-cloud architectures are supposedly the future. Nobody likes themselves

28
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,960
some lock in unless you're the vendor providing integration across all the services, then

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,580
we'll lock into you. That is sort of their pitch here. But they're also kind of enticing

30
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,920
it with a, we're going to have an open source spirit approach to this. And we're going to

31
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,680
deeply integrate products of a number of open source companies and projects. And we're going

32
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,400
to essentially make them first party services, they say. I'll give you an example. Where

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,120
AWS has created replacements for some of these, Google is going to integrate the actual product

34
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,880
of MongoDB or Redis Labs or Elasticsearch or many others, Confluent, many others, right

35
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,200
in as first party services. But they're the genuine product that they will be then in

36
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,960
theory creating some sort of financial agreement with and contributing back upstream. And again,

37
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,080
they'll say, you can use us to actually take advantage of these original open source projects

38
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,120
and the multi cloud environment. And you get it all with one bill and one dashboard. Yay,

39
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
Google.

40
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,600
And it doesn't leave a bad taste in the community's mouth. Like you have with AWS. Companies like

41
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,440
MongoDB have spoken out very clearly against AWS and some of the practices that they've

42
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,360
been engaging in. And for Google to say, look, we're not going to do that. We're just going

43
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,480
to pay those companies, they're due. And we're going to give you those products exactly as

44
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,560
they are. That just seems a very good strategy. It's probably not from a business point of

45
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,720
view, immediately a good strategy. Otherwise, Amazon would be doing that with AWS. But long

46
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,160
term, it's probably a much better strategy because it just keeps the community on side.

47
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,160
And it really lets Google position this as we are open source first kind of company.

48
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,040
And we're giving back to these projects. You know, it's a it's a good guy Google story.

49
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,840
Yeah, although Anthos itself is not open source, they do mention a lot of open source goodness

50
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,840
there using Kubernetes using all this open source technology. But fundamentally, at least

51
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,920
from what I could find, I couldn't find any source code or license or anything for Anthos.

52
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,000
So it may be made of open source stuff, but ultimately, it itself is not.

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,560
What do you think of this name? This Anthos name? You got Azure, of course, you got AWS,

54
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:40,680
and now you got Anthos. To me, it is. And maybe maybe it's the a name. I'm not sure.

55
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,400
But it just feels like a cheap Azure rip off name. And it's like another version of Google

56
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,920
copying Microsoft. They are the new Microsoft, possibly. I hadn't really thought about it.

57
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:58,120
It just seemed to be a sort of quite well SEO to name to me. It's not really really

58
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,080
anything else. Really, you don't see the similarity. They're both six letter a names that are for

59
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,680
a generalized cloud platform. Like they couldn't have come up with something else. Google Cloud

60
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,600
Platform, at least then you knew you were getting the Google Enterprise infrastructure.

61
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,040
Like that's awesome. I want that. I want to I want to hire the Google Cloud. That's great.

62
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,160
But now this Anthos. It sounds like a it sounds like a knockoff brand of Azure.

63
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:29,000
Well, and it also has the same problem that Azure, Azure, Anthos, Anthos.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,560
Oh, good, good. I have heard the most creative pronunciations of Azure, Azure. I mean, all

65
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,480
these kinds of crazy iterations of it. I just try to go by what the people on stage say.

66
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
That's what I try to go by.

67
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,400
Well, yeah. And they say Azure, but the word is Azure. But let's not get into that. But

68
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,120
yeah, I suppose it is a bit similar. I hadn't really thought about it. It didn't jump out

69
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,080
at me immediately. But now you've pointed it out. I suppose it is pretty obvious. But

70
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,960
surely the actual service itself is going to do the talking because Azure is something

71
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,000
of an underdog to AWS anyway. And so, you know, they're both fighting for scraps, aren't

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
they?

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,480
Well, I agree with your characterization of their market position. But I would argue with

74
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,800
the scraps thing. Again, I go back to the Red Hat IBM acquisition. I think that was

75
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,240
just such a wake up moment for the community. This is a real thing here. And IBM, I mean,

76
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,960
what the hell do they know, right? But IBM, right? They say 80% of the industry's workload

77
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,000
hasn't moved to the cloud yet. The stuff that's come to the cloud, the 20% of work that's

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,740
come to the cloud so far is the easy stuff. Now we've got to move all the hard stuff,

79
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,280
the custom apps, the custom databases, all these really complex things. They've got to

80
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,700
move to the cloud, supposedly. Somebody says that. And that, I guess, is a massively addressable

81
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:55,880
market. So there could be tons of room for Anthos and Azure and AWS to grow still.

82
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,480
Oh, there's certainly a massive growth potentially in the whole industry. So yeah, I suppose

83
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,800
scraps isn't the right word for it. It was very interesting, though. There's an article

84
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,800
on VentureBeat about how keen Google were to prove that they're very serious and they've

85
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,000
got all these partners who are using their services. And they spent an awful lot of time

86
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,840
on stage talking about these partners. And it feels like they are just trying to prove

87
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,840
their relevance.

88
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,140
Yeah, I think nearly the majority of the time, not quite, but nearly was spent with partners

89
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,120
that were pitching their products, not Google stuff. And I think that's a result of where

90
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,960
Google is at in this entire thing. Now it's their turn to prove that their system and

91
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,320
platform is viable. And one of the best ways to demonstrate that viability is by showcasing

92
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,400
partners that are using them at some large scale. I don't want to give away details,

93
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,400
but I know that there are certain companies out there that Google has contacted and offered

94
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,000
them a very aggressive incentive to switch from AWS to the Google Cloud Platform so they

95
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,840
could use them as a showcase. And it's a very compelling offer. And they're really trying

96
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:14,000
to establish this baseline of industry adoption. And they wanted to make that case in a big

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,480
way. And in typical Google style, they got a little rough on their first try. You give

98
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,480
them a few years, they'll have this thing sorted out. But the first attempt, a little

99
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
ham-fisted.

100
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,640
I do wonder what I would pick if I was in that position of having to deploy some serious

101
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,280
infrastructure. I'd probably be more tempted to just use DigitalOcean. I don't know, it

102
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:40,200
depends how big it was. But AWS is just the name you know. And you know that it's going

103
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,160
to not give you any problems apart from locking, which is the major problem. But if you're

104
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,240
not worried about that, it's just what people go with, isn't it?

105
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,220
I think Google's point, though, is people are worried about that lock-in. And that's

106
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,640
what they're trying to solve here. I mean, this is kind of a big deal in a way. Kubernetes

107
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,960
is allowing them to just create this stitching platform to let you deploy on AWS or let you

108
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,000
deploy on Azure or on their own platform. That's a bigger deal than I think we can fully

109
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,880
appreciate. It's a game changer in a way. It's a market shift, in a sense. And you can

110
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,440
deploy that technology yourself. And by the way, it's all free software. When you take

111
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,380
that all in and what that could mean for future data centers and the way systems are built,

112
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,720
it's a huge deal.

113
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,600
It does feel like something new. And it's certainly a new approach by Google to even

114
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,400
acknowledge Microsoft exists. Like they talked about Azure and they have plugins for VS code

115
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,480
now. That feels new as well.

116
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,560
And probably worth mentioning something not even cloud-related is Android phones will

117
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:48,180
now act as a security key if you're using Android 7 or above. This is pretty neat. You

118
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,080
can set up now two-factor authentication with your Google account and your Android device,

119
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:59,340
which will use Bluetooth to provide the authentication token to your PC without having to go through

120
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,000
all of the hassle of creating a Bluetooth connection and pairing it, they claim. Obviously,

121
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,360
they haven't tried this yet. Now, for now, it only works with Chrome, but Google hopes

122
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,680
to turn this into a standard that other browsers and mobile operating system vendors will support.

123
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,160
And the UI is pretty great. The demo that they showed up on stage is you get a two-factor

124
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,960
authentication request, comes down to the Android device, and it prompts you to push

125
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,360
up twice on the volume button. And when you do that, that's your two-factor. It then sends

126
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,600
a token to your PC, which is running Chrome, and logs you into the service. If that actually

127
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,560
took off as a standard and Mozilla was willing to implement it in others, I think that'd

128
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,080
be pretty great. Google has, to their credit, been really forward-thinking on two-factor

129
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,440
authentication for a long time now, pretty much ahead of the rest of the industry.

130
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,120
This comes off the back of Android being certified for the FIDO2 standard. We talked about that

131
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,720
back on episode 95, and we thought that it wouldn't be too long before we saw this stuff,

132
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,920
and here it is only, what, six weeks later.

133
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,560
Yeah, and it's nice that it's like Android 7 and above, so it's available to a good set

134
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,720
of users. Microsoft says that a good set of users are adopting PowerShell, but the growth

135
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,680
is coming on the Linux side of the camp, not PowerShell on Windows.

136
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,360
Yeah, we're talking about PowerShell Core here, and there's a post on the Microsoft

137
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:21,160
dev blog, and there's a nice chart that makes it look like there's just phenomenal growth

138
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:28,240
in Linux use. And you look at it and you think, wow, all these Linux users have adopted PowerShell

139
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,000
Core, this is amazing. But then you dig into it a little bit, and it's kind of not quite

140
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
true.

141
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah, you know, I even saw a discussion online about, will future distributions ship with

142
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,800
PowerShell as the default shell, replacing Bash? I saw that this week. Well, if you look

143
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,240
at it, there's a couple things going on here. First of all, Windows usage is not growing

144
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,880
as significantly for PowerShell Core because it's simply incompatible with certain scripts

145
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:58,760
and existing automations that people have written using previous versions of PowerShell

146
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:05,200
that were unique to Windows. That's why I think Microsoft's going to focus on compatibility,

147
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,680
and it's just going to reunite the products as PowerShell in future versions, but we're

148
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:15,320
not there yet. But in the meantime, you look at the numbers, and they're nearing 12 million

149
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,040
activations of PowerShell on Linux. Like, that's a real number. There's a lot of people

150
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,040
using this.

151
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,880
I'd say 11 or 12 million is certainly very impressive, and you can see why they want

152
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,800
to tout that, but it's a little bit disingenuous the way they've presented it. It's done well

153
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,760
for them in terms of the PR that they wanted from the Linux and open source community.

154
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,080
So fair play to them.

155
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,800
I could definitely see this as being a godsend. If I was a system administrator of a network

156
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,580
that had a bunch of Windows and Linux machines on the same network, and I wanted to automate

157
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:50,520
tasks across all of them, PowerShell would be like the best thing ever. And so it doesn't

158
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,960
surprise me that it's getting a bunch of adoption. And I think it's smart of Microsoft to try

159
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,360
to merge those APIs into one common set now. And that's the direction they're going to

160
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:05,600
take it. In the meantime, Mozilla is focusing on machine learning to triage bugs for Firefox.

161
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,440
Yeah, more good stuff from Mozilla and something really positive to contribute to other projects

162
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:15,640
as well as sorting out their own. Using machine learning to solve what is quite a big problem

163
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:21,240
for certainly large open source projects, where you have all of these duplicate bugs,

164
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,920
and they need to be triaged. And that takes so much time for people to do that. And it

165
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:33,140
doesn't look like it's quite there yet. It's not 100% effective. But it's looking pretty

166
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:38,000
good, like it's going to get there. And hopefully, it won't be too long before other open source

167
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,200
projects can use this because unlike a lot of machine learning stuff, this doesn't need

168
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:50,080
tons and tons of GPUs to work. You can get it working with reasonably good CPUs even.

169
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,760
Yeah, just to give you an idea, the training model was just based on two plus years of

170
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,720
bug data, which they've got decades worth. And they said that was around 100,000 bugs,

171
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,280
they did have to go through and massage the data, set it back to a certain state and not

172
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,920
the fixed state and that took some finagling. But around 100,000 bugs was the training set

173
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,720
and that took 40 minutes on a six core machine with 32 gigabytes of RAM. Hey, I've got a

174
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,560
six core machine with 32 gigabytes of RAM. Yeah. Go for Joe, maybe you could feed it

175
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,200
all of your podcast edits over the last decade. I might put myself out of a job better not

176
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,960
do that. Yeah, we'll just do it and don't say anything. That's what you really do. Yeah,

177
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,640
that'd be the promo. So Mozilla says to get this thing rolling, they developed bug bug

178
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,800
a machine learning tool that automatically assigns a product and component for each untried

179
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:43,200
bug. The whole philosophy here is that if they can get the bugs in front of developers

180
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,240
faster than they get fixed faster. So they send it a whole bunch of data, they trained

181
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:53,120
it up and it's actually been working decently. They deployed it into production in February

182
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,380
and of this year 2019. And they so far have triaged around 350 bugs. And the thing is

183
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,520
because this is Mozilla, you know it's all open source and that everyone's going to benefit

184
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:09,000
from it. Apart from pocket, which we're still waiting for, I think they've been pretty good

185
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,680
with this stuff, haven't they? And so they're using all of their money, which I like to

186
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,960
go on about every possible opportunity, but they're using that for something really good

187
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,920
here because I just can't emphasize that enough. It's something that all projects could benefit

188
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,420
from. And the bar isn't like super high here for bug bug. Like there's a few minimum viable

189
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,760
things that it could check off the list that would save developers a ton of time. And Mozilla

190
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,560
is aware of it. Like here's a couple. Identifying duplicate bugs. Think about that. That would

191
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:42,400
just save so much time. Here's another one. Providing additional automated help for developers

192
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,080
when bug bug detects that things are missing like the steps to reproduce the bug. Saving

193
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,680
them time there. Going back to the user. Getting the steps to reproduce. Or detecting bugs

194
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,160
that might be important. Like something that might be like a very critical thing that needs

195
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,640
addressing immediately and getting it surfaced in front of developers. If bug bug could just

196
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,440
do a few of those things, it would save a considerable amount of administrative work

197
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,400
for bug triaging and developers time.

198
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,480
It's not all been good from Mozilla this week. Well, it depends on your perspective, I suppose.

199
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:20,200
It looks like they are very much on track to enable DNS over HTTPS by default in Firefox.

200
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,040
But what do you think? Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

201
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,640
Well, I think you're probably one of the few people who thinks it's a bad thing. And I

202
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,320
know why you think it's a bad thing. I don't necessarily disagree. But this has been coming

203
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,240
down the pipe. We knew this was going to happen. We talked about it before. DNS over HTTPS

204
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:40,760
aims to improve user privacy, security, and the reliability of connections by sending

205
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,120
and receiving DNS using HTTPS.

206
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,480
Yeah, which sounds great, right? Except when you find out who they're partnering up with

207
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,480
to do it.

208
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,600
Yeah, it's been a bit controversial. They are using Cloudflare right now and only Cloudflare.

209
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,360
And this, by the way, will override whatever the DNS is set on your local machine. So your

210
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,400
local host file, any custom DNS you've set up, Firefox will ignore that and use this

211
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
service.

212
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,020
Now, the news here this week is Mozilla has published a list of requirements that companies

213
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,640
need to meet if they want to be included as a trusted recursive resolver for Firefox's

214
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:23,500
new feature. So they are committing to expanding that list. But Cloudflare is the only partner

215
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,840
right now that meets those requirements and will be shipping with this feature, at least

216
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
at first.

217
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,760
Well, it's the only partner who says they are meeting those requirements. Color me cynical,

218
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,600
but I just, as I talked about in the recent user error, there's just something about Cloudflare

219
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,280
that rubs me the wrong way.

220
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,040
There's something about not using my local host file that rubs me the wrong way. That's

221
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:49,080
a quick, simple way for parents to blacklist a few domains on their local computer to make

222
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,640
sure their kids don't go to Facebook or whatever. Just set up Facebook to go to local host in

223
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,400
your host file and problem solved.

224
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,240
You don't need a fancy filtering system that you pay a subscription fee to. And if Firefox

225
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,320
starts ignoring that, well, there goes one of the many tools that parents had on a Linux

226
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,840
system. And that's just one example, because I'm a parent, and there's a lot of... I have

227
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,760
used my host file in the past to set up fake names for my machines when I'm just playing

228
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,760
around with software.

229
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,320
Like, there's all kinds of reasons why the software on my computer should respect whatever

230
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,240
the DNS settings are for my operating system. That's the way computers are built to work.

231
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,520
That's how it should be done. And that's changing, not immediately, but soon, and it will be

232
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:34,200
the default behavior. They may make a UI setting to turn this off. They haven't yet. But you

233
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,960
can dig around in the config screens, and you can turn it off in there. See, you can

234
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,080
override it, eventually. But it's, you know, it's one more thing now.

235
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,880
Yeah, turn that and smooth scroll off, and I'll be set.

236
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,080
What? Smooth scroll is great. What's your problem with smooth scroll?

237
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,360
Oh, it's just horrible. I can't stand it. First thing I always do when I install Firefox

238
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
a new profile, turn that off.

239
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,400
I can't even with you. You're so XFCE. I can't even with you. You turn off all... I actually

240
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,200
kind of see it now. Yeah, it does fit your profile. You turn off all animations, everything.

241
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Yeah. You might be right. You might be right, actually.

242
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Yeah, there are other definitely good things coming to Firefox very soon.

243
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,760
They're taking a stand against fingerprinting, Joe, and crypto mining scripts, like a very

244
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,880
narrow slice of what challenges users today, but important ones. There's a variety of popular

245
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,520
fingerprinting scripts that embed on many web pages out there that are really just designed

246
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,480
to create a fingerprint around your computer and track you. But probably one of the more

247
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,520
popular fun to talk about ones these days are those crypto miner scripts that use your

248
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,200
CPU or your maybe even GPU to mine some currency while you're visiting the old website. Well,

249
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,320
in collaboration with a service called Disconnect, they have embedded in Firefox, or will be

250
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:48,280
I should say, a compiled list of domains that serve these fingerprinting and crypto mining

251
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,720
scripts. And now in the latest Firefox nightly and beta versions, you can turn this on already.

252
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,080
In Firefox nightly 68 and in beta 67, according to my research, you have that available now.

253
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,320
Yeah, it's been a long time coming, but it's yet another useful feature in Firefox. So

254
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,760
I don't think I can be cynical about this one.

255
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,760
No, not really. It actually does seem like a very good service for average users. And

256
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,760
the language around this, the way Mozilla is talking about it, it sounds like more is

257
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,800
coming. Like there's going to be future expanded blocking that's built into Firefox.

258
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,560
Yeah, always good to see more security and privacy features coming into Firefox. But

259
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,360
security is not something the matrix project can really boast about this week, is it?

260
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,440
That's harsh. That's harsh. Yeah, when you read the public statement, it's like, okay,

261
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,760
not so bad. But then when you dig a little deeper into the story, it's a little more

262
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,140
embarrassing than they're leading on. But the short version is an attacker gained access

263
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:47,680
to the servers hosting matrix.org. And the intruder had access to the production databases,

264
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,520
which was potentially giving them access to unencrypted message data, password hashes,

265
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,440
and access token. So as a precaution, matrix.org is strongly recommending perhaps forcing you

266
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,280
to change your password. Now, the mistakes that allowed this to happen were fundamental.

267
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,920
I don't think there's any other way to say it. Developers having way more access than

268
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:14,720
they needed. And basic SSH errors. Well, there's the matrix.org version of the story. And then

269
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,160
there is the bug reports or issues that the attacker actually opened against matrix.org,

270
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:26,800
which I think totaled in eight. And now they're all deleted. So on their website, matrix writes,

271
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,680
the hacker exploited a vulnerability in our production infrastructure, specifically a

272
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:36,320
slightly outdated version of Jenkins, home servers other than matrix.org are unaffected.

273
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,640
But when you dig into the story, and we'll have a link in the show notes, you can find

274
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,920
it on archive.org. Still, you will see that the attacker in in in sort of an old school,

275
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:50,040
almost classy way, although I'm not encouraging this attack, but to the attackers credit,

276
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:56,360
the individual went and opened issues for all of the different infrastructure vulnerabilities

277
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,280
that they found, including the SSH access, the misconfigured Jenkins stuff, a lot of

278
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,720
the misconfigurations that they documented across the entire network were all listed

279
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:11,040
out right there in in their GitHub, which they promptly deleted, but we managed to get

280
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,520
a snapshot of before they did.

281
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:18,120
Yeah, I don't really see any reason to disbelieve them. It all seems quite plausible.

282
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,600
Yeah, and it's common mistakes to make, especially when your focus is on the software, you're

283
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,440
not necessarily infrastructure experts yourself, the infrastructure is a requirement of the

284
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:30,980
project, not a facilitator of the project. And so sometimes these things just get overlooked.

285
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,880
And I think it's important to keep perspective here on this story. As far as we can tell,

286
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,120
source code and packages have not been impacted. There's still ongoing research to find out

287
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,960
exactly the extent of this. But right now, they're just recommending you change your

288
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,440
passwords. They say no plaintext passwords were leaked, but passwords could still be

289
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,680
cracked because of the hash that they were using. And they also recommend that if you're

290
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,060
using their bridge service, like an IRC bridge, you go change your Nixerv password. There's

291
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:02,800
no evidence that anything's been breached there. But they recommend changing it.

292
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,280
And they have promised a full postmortem. So I do look forward to reading that. I suspect

293
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,360
it will be a lot of what we already know from these issues that were raised by the attacker.

294
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,720
But it just looks bad for the project. I remember when Linux Mint was compromised, that sort

295
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,600
of really knocked them down in my estimations. And I suppose it shouldn't really because

296
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,280
just because you make a great piece of software doesn't necessarily mean you're good at the

297
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:32,920
infrastructure stuff. But they kind of go hand in hand in terms of credibility.

298
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,280
Yeah, and you got to imagine it's a tough spot because as a project becomes larger,

299
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,120
it demands more infrastructure, which becomes more complicated, but you don't necessarily

300
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,800
become more of an infrastructure expert. So that's a really rough position to be in. It's

301
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,800
a rock and a hard place.

302
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,520
I think the silver lining here is that once this postmortem comes out, other projects

303
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,880
will be able to read it and learn the lessons.

304
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,480
Too bad the Linux Foundation isn't like spending their money on some sort of like infrastructure

305
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,280
initiative for projects like this, you know? Because this really isn't their core competency.

306
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,640
Yeah, maybe they should put a few quid towards this.

307
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,160
I don't know, Joe, that's not blockchain enough. You got to think Bitcoin here.

308
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,360
Yeah, there's always a solution that involves blockchain. But there's been some potentially

309
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,680
bad news for Bitcoin in the last week, and that is that the Chinese government might

310
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,240
ban mining of it.

311
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,520
Yeah, that would actually be a huge deal for the global Bitcoin community. In recent years,

312
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,440
China has become dominant in not only the manufacturing of the miners, but also in the

313
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,240
operation of the mining pool. Like, buildings dedicated to this. It's a massive operation

314
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,240
over there.

315
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,400
And if this did actually happen, it would have a massive impact on just the whole industry,

316
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,800
I suppose, of Bitcoin. And I saw a lot of articles about this and people getting a bit

317
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:50,480
excited about it. But if you really dig down into it, China does propose a ban on a lot

318
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,280
of things. And often those things don't actually happen.

319
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:00,120
Yeah, that's true. In fact, they're just in the seeking public comment phase right now.

320
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:05,240
However, there have been some recent signs that the Chinese government is souring on

321
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,320
the cryptocurrency sector. In 2017, which was a great year for cryptocurrency, China

322
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:17,720
banned retail cryptocurrency trading, which did cause some impact on the value of Bitcoin.

323
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,440
And then in January of 2018, the Chinese regulator said that they wanted to see an orderly exit

324
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,580
from the cryptocurrency mining business. I don't actually think this would be a horrible

325
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,120
thing. If we could get some of these people out of the mining market, that would actually

326
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,000
open up opportunities for other people to join in. Maybe it would even lower the difficulty

327
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,880
a bit. It would be really good for Bitcoin.

328
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,480
Yeah, that's what I was wondering, whether it would lower the difficulty or not. Because

329
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,280
maybe it would lower the difficulty temporarily, but then everyone would jump on it. And I

330
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,760
don't know what it would do to the value of it either. I think the value would probably

331
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,720
jump initially, as the difficulty dropped. And it's just there are so many factors with

332
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,000
this. And the thing is, you have to understand that just because you make something illegal

333
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
doesn't mean that people don't do it.

334
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,160
That's true. Yeah, we get to watch a real show here with Bitcoin. Not only do we get

335
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,800
to watch people try to figure out how to make money off blockchain, but we get to watch

336
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:20,720
an open source, math backed cryptocurrency develop around the world. And then we get

337
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:26,040
to see how all of the different players in the world affected in a way that I don't think

338
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:31,080
is normally as accessible to us. And the fact that it's all based around free software is

339
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,080
sort of mind blowing.

340
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,880
It is. And the thing that I like about it is that I've got enough of an investment in

341
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,740
it. I think I put 100 pounds in at some point and mined a bit of other cryptocurrency. So

342
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:50,320
I've invested a tiny bit into it, enough to give me some interest and potentially if it

343
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,960
exploded massively and became worth a million dollars or whatever per Bitcoin, that it would

344
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,260
actually be worth it. But then if it just completely tanks the other way, then you know,

345
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,280
I've wasted a bit of money, but you know, I've spent more than that on nights out.

346
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,440
Yeah, you've got a good show in the meantime.

347
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,020
Yeah, exactly. So either way, it's interesting to me. And I don't know, I think the reality

348
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:19,000
may well be that it'll just kind of settle somewhere around, I don't know, maybe 10,000

349
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,040
or something. Hang on, am I getting into Bitcoin predictions? I really shouldn't be doing this,

350
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
should I?

351
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,120
No. You know, I feel like I got out at a good time. I mostly completely got out. I'm like

352
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,920
you now. I got enough where if it really went crazy, it would be good for me. But if it

353
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:39,080
completely bottomed out, it would not affect my life. However, I did manage, I feel like,

354
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,360
to strategically spend at the right times. I am in a studio surrounded by equipment that

355
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,320
was all bought with Bitcoin right now. And that was a pretty good investment because

356
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,200
I did not put the amount of money initially in that I spent on all of this stuff. Like

357
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,000
there's a lot of gear in here that is really high end, state of the art stuff that I bought

358
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,160
with Bitcoin. And now I can sit back and continue to use this gear while the value is completely

359
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:08,240
tanked from when I cashed out. And so that's why I'm really at peace with it now. I got

360
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,360
way more than I initially put into it because I got in around 2011, 2012 and I kind of cashed

361
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:20,100
out and reinvested that into my business. So I really can't complain. And now I've got

362
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,960
just enough left. Like you say, if it goes up to a million, that's great. If it crashes,

363
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,400
that would be sad, but it's still a hell of an experiment to watch in real time.

364
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:33,120
Well, we won't spend too much time talking about it, but it's definitely something we're

365
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,560
going to keep an eye on over the coming months and years, I think.

366
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,380
Yeah, we definitely try to find a balance there. But I think looking back at it historically,

367
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,620
it's going to be a fascinating story 10, 15 years from now. So we do want to get it down
