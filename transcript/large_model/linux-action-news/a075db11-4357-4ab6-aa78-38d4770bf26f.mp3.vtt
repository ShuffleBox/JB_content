00:00.000 --> 00:09.800
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 137, recorded on December 20th, 2019.

00:09.800 --> 00:10.800
I'm Chris.

00:10.800 --> 00:11.800
And I'm Joe.

00:11.800 --> 00:12.800
Hello, Joe.

00:12.800 --> 00:16.560
Good to be connected with you and great to start out with some news from Firefox and

00:16.560 --> 00:20.440
an update to their DNS over HTTPS support.

00:20.440 --> 00:24.280
Yeah, they've added another partner called NextDNS.

00:24.280 --> 00:29.760
So now you don't have to use Cloudflare if you want to use DNS over HTTPS.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.200
Have you ever heard of NextDNS before this?

00:32.200 --> 00:35.360
No, I was hoping you may have done.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.640
I did a little digging.

00:36.640 --> 00:39.560
So they launched in March of 2019.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.340
So this year as we record.

00:41.340 --> 00:45.860
But they're sort of one of these newer up and coming fancier, a lot more features kind

00:45.860 --> 00:52.040
of DNS provider and DNS over HTTPS or DOE as Joe likes to call it, has been one of their

00:52.040 --> 00:58.260
major focuses for pushing out different apps to Android, iOS, I think these old legacy

00:58.260 --> 01:01.000
desktops called Linux and Windows and Mac OS.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.920
Not familiar with those, of course, because it's only about mobile, right?

01:03.920 --> 01:08.980
But Cloudflare is like the name, you know, I know Cloudflare and I have to be honest

01:08.980 --> 01:16.040
that that consumer brand trust thing inside me when I see these two next to each other

01:16.040 --> 01:19.120
sort of trust the Cloudflare name a little more.

01:19.120 --> 01:23.200
But looking at NextDNS, they seem like a pretty, pretty cool company.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.840
And of course, they agreed to Mozilla's privacy requirements.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.960
Which are pretty stringent.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.800
So that's kind of a good sign.

01:30.800 --> 01:37.200
I think I see what you're saying about Cloudflare being the name, you know, and this NextDNS

01:37.200 --> 01:39.320
company, we don't really know anything about them.

01:39.320 --> 01:42.440
But I don't think it's particularly important who they are.

01:42.440 --> 01:46.740
I think what's far more important is that there now is a choice.

01:46.740 --> 01:50.640
And this will hopefully open the gates for even more choice.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.640
Well put.

01:51.640 --> 01:55.180
And I you know, I like to remind people when we do talk about this, there are self hosted

01:55.180 --> 02:01.000
open source DNS over HTTPS DNS servers, you can run now and you could manually enter it

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
in there.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
But it's nice to see it baked in.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.120
We've seen pretty quick adoption of DOA this year.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.720
It feels like only a few months ago, we started talking about it.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.640
And now you can already use it in Firefox and Chrome.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.360
I know I was thinking that too.

02:13.360 --> 02:18.200
And Mozilla has sort of positioned itself as an advocate for the technology, which has

02:18.200 --> 02:19.400
been fascinating.

02:19.400 --> 02:25.640
But it also speaks to how fast Firefox is moving, how fast these features are getting

02:25.640 --> 02:26.640
out to end users.

02:26.640 --> 02:30.360
It's been a pretty good year for Firefox, generally, and Mozilla, there have been a

02:30.360 --> 02:36.320
few hiccups, but I think I'm pretty positive about them going into 2020.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.560
Well said, I think it's been really nice to see.

02:38.560 --> 02:44.080
It's been one of the highlights of 2019, really, which we'll get more into in a future episode.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.320
But let's talk about something a little more near term.

02:46.320 --> 02:54.360
Apple, Google, and Amazon are joining forces, yes, cats and dogs are joining forces to rally

02:54.360 --> 02:57.920
behind a new smart home standard called Chip.

02:57.920 --> 03:02.320
Now this is somewhat open source, but I've seen quite a lot of skepticism about this.

03:02.320 --> 03:04.500
This is really your area.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.040
So I'm very keen to hear what you think about this.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.460
Yeah, there are some interesting things we'll get into here.

03:09.460 --> 03:14.040
But admit it, Joe, the first thing you thought of was that ex-KCD comic of all we need is

03:14.040 --> 03:15.040
another standard.

03:15.040 --> 03:19.560
Yeah, by trying to unify standards, you end up just creating yet another one.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.320
And that does feel like what we're going to end up with here.

03:22.320 --> 03:26.960
But maybe that new standard will actually be better than the other ones.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.160
It sounds really promising.

03:28.160 --> 03:34.260
But those companies all working together on a new standard, even though Apple just open

03:34.260 --> 03:41.120
source bits of HomeKit and the Z-Wave folks raised their hands and said, we could do some

03:41.120 --> 03:45.280
open sourcing too, but Chip offers something unique.

03:45.280 --> 03:51.320
Well it's all IP based and using IPv6, so maybe that means that it might solve some

03:51.320 --> 03:53.220
of your double net issues.

03:53.220 --> 03:58.520
Not only that, but it takes advantage of any existing network infrastructure you have.

03:58.520 --> 04:04.640
So in the case of a Z-Wave home automation network, the Z-Wave radios sort of form a

04:04.640 --> 04:05.860
mesh network.

04:05.860 --> 04:10.180
And you can have some Z-Wave devices that are boosters and repeaters of the network.

04:10.180 --> 04:15.100
But if a device can't talk to the other devices, you have a dead spot in your network.

04:15.100 --> 04:19.760
In this case, you could extend a Wi-Fi network, you could drop an Ethernet and get IP to a

04:19.760 --> 04:23.820
device and they can participate in the overall smart network.

04:23.820 --> 04:27.820
But additionally, Chip allows for fallback to different physical mediums.

04:27.820 --> 04:33.760
It can use Bluetooth LE, it has support for cellular, it even understands DSL and DSL

04:33.760 --> 04:36.760
authentication for types of ISPs that require that.

04:36.760 --> 04:42.520
The thing that Chip allows for is leveraging off-the-shelf network infrastructure.

04:42.520 --> 04:46.920
And that means the cost in manufacturing goes way down and the availability to consumers

04:46.920 --> 04:48.720
goes way up.

04:48.720 --> 04:53.420
Overall I'm very skeptical about this, but I like the ideas behind it.

04:53.420 --> 04:57.980
And the fact that it got Apple to open source bits of HomeKit and the Z-Wave folks to open

04:57.980 --> 05:03.120
source their implementation, it seems like a real big net win for the Home Assistant

05:03.120 --> 05:05.800
community and other automation communities.

05:05.800 --> 05:09.840
Presumably the reason that Apple and Google and Amazon are interested in this is because

05:09.840 --> 05:14.840
they want to drive more adoption of their various voice assistants.

05:14.840 --> 05:20.160
But my question is, is this going to mean more self-hosting and more being able to hack

05:20.160 --> 05:25.360
stuff and not have to rely on the cloud and be able to keep it all within your network

05:25.360 --> 05:29.360
or maybe going out to servers that you are in control of elsewhere?

05:29.360 --> 05:35.680
I think it's hard to say overall because it will likely come down to each device's implementation

05:35.680 --> 05:40.480
if that vendor locks it into a cloud service or something like that.

05:40.480 --> 05:46.720
However, open sourcing of Z-Wave, bits of HomeKit and this new chip standard that they

05:46.720 --> 05:53.840
say will also be open source and posted on GitHub surely means great things for communities

05:53.840 --> 05:59.640
that are trying to accomplish those types of things, like the Home Assistant community.

05:59.640 --> 06:02.880
I'm actually a pretty big fan of HomeKit.

06:02.880 --> 06:03.880
It's so silly.

06:03.880 --> 06:10.480
I hate it because it's, until maybe just now, been sort of a thing of just the Apple iOS

06:10.480 --> 06:11.480
ecosystem.

06:11.480 --> 06:16.480
And if you don't have iOS devices, it's silly to buy a HomeKit smart plug and a HomeKit

06:16.480 --> 06:19.240
Lite and a HomeKit LED strip.

06:19.240 --> 06:20.240
Why would you spend money on that?

06:20.240 --> 06:21.760
You don't have an iOS device.

06:21.760 --> 06:27.480
But the HomeKit protocol itself and the little mechanisms and devices around it are really

06:27.480 --> 06:28.480
great.

06:28.480 --> 06:29.880
It supports IP and Wi-Fi.

06:29.880 --> 06:34.200
It supports Bluetooth LE, which means you can incorporate battery-powered sensors and

06:34.200 --> 06:40.760
motion sensors and all kinds of little devices throughout your home, as well as bigger devices.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.460
And it's all over the LAN.

06:42.460 --> 06:44.240
No cloud service required.

06:44.240 --> 06:48.080
You could unplug from the internet and still operate all your smart devices.

06:48.080 --> 06:52.900
And it's really easy and user-friendly, like a lot of Apple stuff is.

06:52.900 --> 06:57.600
And like a lot of Apple stuff, it's locked to their ecosystem until maybe now.

06:57.600 --> 07:01.240
And Home Assistant has really nailed their HomeKit implementation already.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.640
So this could take it to the next level.

07:02.640 --> 07:06.940
As far as where I'm sitting, I think this is going to make my setup way, way better.

07:06.940 --> 07:12.160
Even if this chip stuff doesn't go anywhere, and just the improvements with HomeKit being

07:12.160 --> 07:18.560
better documented and Z-Wave going open source would be a huge win and are going to be great

07:18.560 --> 07:19.880
for 2020 development.

07:19.880 --> 07:24.840
Well, having briefly spoken to Alex about it, he seems pretty skeptical as well.

07:24.840 --> 07:29.360
But we'll have to see if we hear more about this on Self-Hosted in 2020.

07:29.360 --> 07:32.000
Yeah, and I'll conclude with this.

07:32.000 --> 07:37.100
Smart home automation is so much more than these smart tubes and the ecosystems that

07:37.100 --> 07:41.740
Google and Amazon and Apple make available.

07:41.740 --> 07:42.960
That's what this is really about.

07:42.960 --> 07:50.020
This is about fulfilling the promise of complete low-power device smart home automation that

07:50.020 --> 07:52.440
Z-Wave and ZigBee help accomplish now.

07:52.440 --> 07:57.880
There are entire automation ecosystems that are way outside the smart speaker ecosystems

07:57.880 --> 08:01.940
that are featureful and have been around for years.

08:01.940 --> 08:05.680
And so if your idea of smart home automation is one of these smart tubes, I think it's

08:05.680 --> 08:11.240
worth looking at some YouTube videos or listening to Self-Hosted to see what else is out there.

08:11.240 --> 08:15.520
Because if you're into everything on your land, nothing goes out to the cloud, it's

08:15.520 --> 08:21.480
all under your control, we have some really great coverage in the Self-Hosted program,

08:21.480 --> 08:22.480
Self-Hosted.

08:22.480 --> 08:25.840
Yeah, even though I'm tempted, I might have to give it a go next year at some point.

08:25.840 --> 08:30.680
Something I've been intending to play with and is even more appealing now is multi-pass

08:30.680 --> 08:36.160
and Canonical has reached 1.0 of the mini cloud on your workstation.

08:36.160 --> 08:42.960
Yeah, this one point I was coming just a week after the 0.9, which is a bit strange.

08:42.960 --> 08:48.460
But what's interesting about it is that it manages your virtual machines using the native

08:48.460 --> 08:50.680
hypervisor on whatever platform you're using.

08:50.680 --> 08:56.340
So KVM on Linux, Hyper-V on Windows, and HyperKit on Mac OS.

08:56.340 --> 09:01.240
So this is just going to work no matter what development environment you want to use.

09:01.240 --> 09:07.320
The virtualizer is just a detail now that you don't even need to concern yourself with.

09:07.320 --> 09:08.520
Multi-pass will handle it for you.

09:08.520 --> 09:13.480
This is really kind of a Canonical slash Ubuntu focused approach, being able to just quickly

09:13.480 --> 09:15.140
fire up a VM and get to work.

09:15.140 --> 09:18.920
You want to test something or try something or have an idea.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.780
Why even putz around with the KVM setups?

09:21.780 --> 09:25.120
Why mess with your virtual boxes or your Hyper-Vs when you could just use multi-pass?

09:25.120 --> 09:27.040
I really like the idea.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.880
And if I was building a lot of Ubuntu VMs on a regular basis and integrating updates

09:30.880 --> 09:33.920
and things like this, this would probably be a go to tool.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.700
Or imagine doing development testing with this.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.060
You can fire up a quick multi-pass environment.

09:38.060 --> 09:42.320
And if you're a developer, maybe you don't know how to get the KVMs on your old Linux

09:42.320 --> 09:43.320
box.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.640
This will take care of it for you.

09:44.640 --> 09:51.080
It feels like bumping this to a 1.0 release is just another little duck getting into a

09:51.080 --> 09:53.360
row for Canonical.

09:53.360 --> 09:59.140
They've done a lot this year to get everything onto that professional level.

09:59.140 --> 10:03.880
And now they can say that it's a 1.0 stable for multi-pass.

10:03.880 --> 10:07.600
It feels like a small part of a much bigger picture to me.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.600
Yeah, perhaps.

10:08.600 --> 10:12.520
I think too, when you look at the Mac OS support, that's interesting.

10:12.520 --> 10:19.560
To me, it looks like telling a story of full platform developer support.

10:19.560 --> 10:23.040
Whatever platform they're on, we've got a quick way for them to create VMs.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.200
Oh, you're on Windows?

10:24.200 --> 10:29.760
Why don't you also try out Ubuntu on the Windows subsystem for Linux as well?

10:29.760 --> 10:31.380
They've really nailed that.

10:31.380 --> 10:36.560
We have something that's approachable by developers for just about any platform they want, even

10:36.560 --> 10:38.440
if it's Mac, even if it's Windows.

10:38.440 --> 10:42.160
I remember at the beginning of this decade, Shot of Worth talking about wanting to get

10:42.160 --> 10:46.120
Ubuntu everywhere on TVs and fridges and stuff like that.

10:46.120 --> 10:50.840
And the reality is that Ubuntu kind of is everywhere now, but not necessarily for the

10:50.840 --> 10:53.080
consumer, at least not in their face.

10:53.080 --> 10:56.840
But it's everywhere for developers and everywhere in the cloud.

10:56.840 --> 10:57.840
Whoa.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.400
You just blew my mind, Joe.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.400
And you're right.

11:00.400 --> 11:06.960
And what's kind of cooler about this way it turned out is it's not necessarily exclusive

11:06.960 --> 11:07.960
to Ubuntu.

11:07.960 --> 11:16.480
Like a TV deal with say LG had chosen Ubuntu instead of WebOS for their smart televisions.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.860
That's not something Fedora could approach necessarily.

11:18.860 --> 11:19.860
That's locked in.

11:19.860 --> 11:20.860
They got it.

11:20.860 --> 11:21.860
They got it.

11:21.860 --> 11:24.720
Probably a multi-year agreement, special R&D relationship, et cetera, et cetera.

11:24.720 --> 11:28.160
But this kind of stuff is they built it and they got there.

11:28.160 --> 11:30.960
They took the Windows subsystem seriously.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.740
They built tools for developers.

11:32.740 --> 11:36.240
They've targeted the cloud platforms very aggressively.

11:36.240 --> 11:40.420
They've tried to make it easy to get going and start writing applications on their platform

11:40.420 --> 11:42.240
wherever you're at.

11:42.240 --> 11:48.060
And they didn't have to do it with any kind of crazy contracts or lock-in or anything

11:48.060 --> 11:51.040
that's dirty play or a special advantage.

11:51.040 --> 11:55.080
They just did it based on the quality of the product and the demand from developers.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.880
So you got to respect it.

11:56.880 --> 11:57.880
And you're right.

11:57.880 --> 11:58.880
They are kind of lining everything up.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.840
They're getting a real complete picture here now.

12:00.840 --> 12:05.760
There's been a bit going on with KDE over the last week and some good news for Krita.

12:05.760 --> 12:12.160
And very good news from the folks at Epic, the makers of the Unreal game engine.

12:12.160 --> 12:18.280
They have given Krita a $25,000 what they call mega grant.

12:18.280 --> 12:22.480
And this follows recent money that went to Blender and then Lutris before this.

12:22.480 --> 12:28.960
Yeah, but the amount that they gave to Blender was $1.2 million as opposed to $25,000 to

12:28.960 --> 12:29.960
Krita.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.800
So it's kind of a different scale.

12:32.800 --> 12:33.800
Yeah.

12:33.800 --> 12:39.360
So if I'm looking at it from Epic's standpoint, Blender is likely a more vital tool in the

12:39.360 --> 12:41.720
model creation for games, right?

12:41.720 --> 12:48.000
Whereas Krita could be more of it's art, it's touch up, it's cover art, but it's not necessarily

12:48.000 --> 12:49.320
core to game creation.

12:49.320 --> 12:52.080
Where Blender, you could create worlds in that thing.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.120
And it is definitely going to help.

12:54.120 --> 12:57.000
And it's also a good promotion for Krita.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
It's good publicity.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.520
I mean, we're talking about it.

12:59.520 --> 13:00.520
Yeah.

13:00.520 --> 13:04.680
And one of the things I find fascinating is it's one of those awkward fields that we have

13:04.680 --> 13:10.400
found ourselves in over and over again in 2019 and that is commercial company that has

13:10.400 --> 13:15.600
crazy app store or does crazy practices and has really, really commercial practices or

13:15.600 --> 13:16.600
whatever it could be.

13:16.600 --> 13:20.480
You know, there's, there's several examples of these Microsoft anyways, and then they

13:20.480 --> 13:24.260
do something really great and you're like, Oh, and then they do something really great

13:24.260 --> 13:30.000
again and then again and you go, Oh man, now I like, I kind of like challenge my assumptions

13:30.000 --> 13:31.760
about a lot of things.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.040
This is really weird.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.200
And that's why I find these stories fascinating.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.320
What about this Kubuntu powered laptop then?

13:37.320 --> 13:38.320
Yeah.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.320
What about this thing?

13:39.320 --> 13:40.320
How about this?

13:40.320 --> 13:45.880
A laptop that will sell preloaded with Kubuntu on it.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.640
And in the Phronix article that we'll link to that Michael Arpo wrote up, he says they're

13:49.640 --> 13:55.120
going to get quote, a significant contribution from each laptop sold to the Kubuntu council.

13:55.120 --> 14:01.280
It looks like it's a Clevo P960 RD with some alterations to improve the Linux experience.

14:01.280 --> 14:07.160
It's got a Nvidia RTX card in there and an Intel I7-9750H.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.160
Yeah.

14:08.160 --> 14:10.920
And 32 gigabytes of RAM.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.720
And you are going to pay for all of that.

14:12.720 --> 14:13.720
Yeah.

14:13.720 --> 14:14.720
What do you suppose the prices is?

14:14.720 --> 14:19.120
I went and priced the stock Clevo model and it started around $1,500.

14:19.120 --> 14:24.840
Well, we don't know for sure yet, but from a post in the Phronix forums by Michael Mikowski,

14:24.840 --> 14:31.760
who says he's the director of this project, he says that it's going to be $2,400, which

14:31.760 --> 14:34.320
is pretty pricey.

14:34.320 --> 14:38.760
But then for that spec, it's only a markup of about $300, he reckons.

14:38.760 --> 14:42.560
And they have done a lot of work to optimize it and make everything work.

14:42.560 --> 14:47.300
I could really see why distributions would want to monetize a little bit by selling a

14:47.300 --> 14:50.240
hardware experience where they can put a little extra effort into it.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.740
I don't know how much involvement the Kubuntu project had here, but I like to fantasize

14:53.740 --> 14:59.240
about elementary OS pre-shipping on an XPS 13 type of piece of hardware and how nice

14:59.240 --> 15:03.080
that experience would be and how if they were to work on a little bit, they could really

15:03.080 --> 15:04.440
nail it.

15:04.440 --> 15:06.360
But you got to wonder how these programs are going to work.

15:06.360 --> 15:11.780
I believe this particular Kubuntu focus laptop is backed by Tuxedo.

15:11.780 --> 15:16.800
So in theory, Tuxedo would be doing the support, but I'd like to know how that's going to work

15:16.800 --> 15:20.320
because I could see this happening for more and more distributions as time goes on.

15:20.320 --> 15:26.040
If I'm going to spend $2,400 on a one-off laptop like this, especially when it's the

15:26.040 --> 15:30.740
first one they've ever done, I'm really curious what that support story looks like two years

15:30.740 --> 15:33.240
down the road when I need to replace the keyboard or something.

15:33.240 --> 15:36.720
Well, I've heard very mixed things about Tuxedo computers.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.080
Some people say that they're good.

15:38.080 --> 15:42.960
I know that they shipped a review unit to the Ubuntu podcast and those guys were not

15:42.960 --> 15:46.120
impressed at all with that, but that was a while ago.

15:46.120 --> 15:49.080
So hopefully they've improved things since then.

15:49.080 --> 15:52.840
I'm not sure how much of a market there's going to be for this because at that kind

15:52.840 --> 16:00.200
of price, there's a lot of competition and yes, it's going to support Kubuntu and a Linux

16:00.200 --> 16:04.440
first vendor, but are people really going to go for it?

16:04.440 --> 16:05.440
I don't know.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.440
Yeah, we'll see.

16:06.440 --> 16:12.400
I think one of my favorite things about Linux is that I can load it on all of my computers,

16:12.400 --> 16:15.760
whereas Mac OS seems so limited because it can only be installed on Macs.

16:15.760 --> 16:20.520
It seems crazy that my primary operating system could only be installed on certain hardware.

16:20.520 --> 16:26.280
So I don't know if I really like this line anyways, this idea, but for new users, I could

16:26.280 --> 16:27.280
see it appealing.

16:27.280 --> 16:32.840
The fact of the matter is Plasma is great and I'd love to see more computers shipping

16:32.840 --> 16:34.440
with Plasma as default.

16:34.440 --> 16:38.800
Well, Plasma is hopefully going to get even better thanks to a competition that KDE have

16:38.800 --> 16:43.520
launched to make promotional videos and more papers for them and the prizes are a couple

16:43.520 --> 16:45.340
of Tuxedo computers.

16:45.340 --> 16:47.200
This is a fun approach they're taking.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.600
I've been involved with some of these promotional videos.

16:49.600 --> 16:55.000
I've done two or three of them for the project when they had new releases, but I think it's

16:55.000 --> 16:58.640
always kind of a cram because somebody in the project has to animate the video, then

16:58.640 --> 17:01.720
they got to get me a script and I record it and send it back to them and then they got

17:01.720 --> 17:04.040
to time the music and all of that.

17:04.040 --> 17:07.560
So this idea here is maybe there's people out there in the community that just love

17:07.560 --> 17:13.200
doing video and could put together a great promotional video to talk about the 5.18 release,

17:13.200 --> 17:18.160
which sounds like it's really shaping up to be a very good release.

17:18.160 --> 17:22.560
So they'd love to really promote it and want to have a few people submit and see which

17:22.560 --> 17:23.560
one's the best.

17:23.560 --> 17:25.000
I like that idea a lot.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.260
The wallpapers one, that's always fun, you know, whatever.

17:28.260 --> 17:31.000
But that video thing, I think that's a good idea.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.120
I think when new releases come out that have a bunch of really hard work put into them,

17:35.120 --> 17:40.280
doing something in video helps people understand the improvements from one release to the other.

17:40.280 --> 17:44.640
When you're going from 5.17 to 5.18, but you've made dramatic improvements and changed a lot

17:44.640 --> 17:48.680
of defaults, it's nice to illustrate that when a version number just doesn't.

17:48.680 --> 17:53.440
What do you think about the rule that you've got to use free software to make the video?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.440
Well, I would use KDE in live.

17:55.440 --> 18:00.160
So I mean, that's not so bad.

18:00.160 --> 18:04.860
I'm not big on telling people what tools to use to express themselves.

18:04.860 --> 18:07.000
I'm more of a whatever tool works for you.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.140
These ones happen to be the best for me and I'd love to tell you about them kind of guy,

18:10.140 --> 18:13.440
but you must use my tool kind of guy.

18:13.440 --> 18:18.120
But you know, I guess it's for an open source project, right?

18:18.120 --> 18:24.760
And what better way to test these things out, work out the kinks than to dog food them like

18:24.760 --> 18:25.760
this?

18:25.760 --> 18:28.040
So in this instance, I think it kind of works.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.040
What do you think?

18:29.040 --> 18:33.880
Yeah, I can kind of understand why they want to have the assets and the source files, presumably

18:33.880 --> 18:36.960
so that they can tweak them a little bit if necessary.

18:36.960 --> 18:43.560
So that's one justification for it, although it does feel a little bit elitist, maybe.

18:43.560 --> 18:48.760
Maybe you've got great skills on a Mac with Final Cut or whatever, and you could create

18:48.760 --> 18:52.080
this great promotional video for them.

18:52.080 --> 18:58.280
It just seems a little bit like they're excluding potential creators.

18:58.280 --> 19:01.600
But I do understand the thinking behind it, especially if they want the assets.

19:01.600 --> 19:05.480
Yeah, and if they could somehow package all those assets up and then somebody else could

19:05.480 --> 19:10.140
work on them next time for the next release, then it sort of even continues to increase

19:10.140 --> 19:13.640
in value and sort of solidify why they would make that decision.

19:13.640 --> 19:17.560
It's their call at the end of the day, and it's their contest, but I think you and I

19:17.560 --> 19:20.080
sort of see it more eye to eye on that one.

19:20.080 --> 19:23.820
I'm not so sure we're so eye to eye on the Atari VCS.

19:23.820 --> 19:25.440
Maybe I'm just a hopeful diehard.

19:25.440 --> 19:29.600
Yeah, we're seeing a blog post from Atari this week on Medium.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.920
Am I wrong about Medium?

19:31.920 --> 19:35.400
You open it and it's just suddenly full screen pop ups and you can't see anything.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.400
Hey, Joe.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.400
Hey, Joe.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.400
Can I tell you about the newsletter?

19:38.400 --> 19:41.400
God, I hate that.

19:41.400 --> 19:46.440
I'm so glad that Elementary moved off Medium.

19:46.440 --> 19:53.320
But anyway, so this blog post is pretty much saying, hey, let's create some content, everyone,

19:53.320 --> 19:54.320
for the VCS.

19:54.320 --> 20:00.200
It's coming soon, and be sure to use Unity Engine and all the standard tools, please.

20:00.200 --> 20:06.120
Well, you can use some of the built-in stuff that comes with Debian as well, but they are

20:06.120 --> 20:08.400
kind of putting Unity first here.

20:08.400 --> 20:12.040
Creators can start developing games and apps for the Atari VCS right now, they write, with

20:12.040 --> 20:14.000
the Unity tools.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.640
Now, that's all good.

20:16.640 --> 20:17.640
That's fine.

20:17.640 --> 20:22.560
You know, when I backed this project, besides just feeling slightly nostalgic and they got

20:22.560 --> 20:29.400
me there, but much like why I backed Stadia, I'm not even a big gamer.

20:29.400 --> 20:36.800
But I really believe in encouraging development of games on Linux and encouraging the ecosystem

20:36.800 --> 20:41.200
to keep Linux a viable gaming platform, to keep Vulkan working great, to stay on top

20:41.200 --> 20:45.320
of the underlying sound systems and the graphic systems, and to keep pressure on our display

20:45.320 --> 20:48.000
servers to stay competitive.

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
Gaming has a lot of ancillary benefits, even when you're primarily using it as a workstation

20:53.000 --> 20:55.800
like I do, who sometimes I like to game, you know.

20:55.800 --> 20:59.180
But as a guy who's using his computer in the most part, I'm not gaming.

20:59.180 --> 21:04.320
But I back these things because I do see it has a bigger picture impact.

21:04.320 --> 21:09.920
When I see that they're just targeting Unity, it's nice to see.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.280
I mean, it still means like Mesa and the other stuff underlying has to be working and the

21:13.280 --> 21:17.840
Vulkan drivers and all that, but it's not quite like it is with Stadia, where the game

21:17.840 --> 21:21.400
has to be essentially hoarded to Linux to work on the platform.

21:21.400 --> 21:25.840
This is not quite what I was hoping my money would be used for, but I knew that was part

21:25.840 --> 21:26.840
of the risk.

21:26.840 --> 21:30.000
But what we're going to end up with here, or what you're going to end up with, because

21:30.000 --> 21:36.880
you've bought it, is essentially just a Linux PC in a nice Atari looking case.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.880
And anything that is going to work on it, any content, games and apps and anything like

21:40.880 --> 21:45.920
that, are going to have to work on Debian because that's what the operating system is

21:45.920 --> 21:46.920
running on.

21:46.920 --> 21:53.160
And the more they kind of pull back on their promises of developing all of this custom

21:53.160 --> 22:00.120
software and the more they rely on standard distributions and standard sets of software,

22:00.120 --> 22:04.800
the more of a generic Linux box it's going to be, which makes it less exciting, but it

22:04.800 --> 22:10.040
means that if they can leverage that Atari brand to get developers onto the platform,

22:10.040 --> 22:12.400
then they're just getting them onto a standard Linux platform.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.920
And okay, if they're using Unity, fair enough.

22:14.920 --> 22:20.200
At least those games are going to work on Linux and porting them to other distributions

22:20.200 --> 22:23.560
is presumably and hopefully going to be fairly straightforward.

22:23.560 --> 22:28.040
I thought they were using Ubuntu, but it seems to have switched to Debian a fair bit ago.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.040
Absolutely.

22:29.040 --> 22:32.440
That's my optimistic take on it, which is why I'm surprised to hear you see it that

22:32.440 --> 22:33.440
way.

22:33.440 --> 22:34.440
But that's what I'm hoping.

22:34.440 --> 22:41.400
Although there is sort of a detail in this whole post that I think belays where things

22:41.400 --> 22:43.560
are actually going to get a little gray.

22:43.560 --> 22:46.880
So they write about this whole thing like just target Unity, just target Linux and you're

22:46.880 --> 22:47.960
good to go.

22:47.960 --> 22:52.560
You can expect a large majority of Linux compatible content to be fully compatible with the Atari

22:52.560 --> 22:55.320
VCS, quote.

22:55.320 --> 22:59.960
Sounds like if you write it for Unity and for Linux, it's going to work on the VCS except

22:59.960 --> 23:03.680
for that one detail that they haven't gone into yet.

23:03.680 --> 23:08.360
Stay tuned for more information, they say, including a link for registration for our

23:08.360 --> 23:12.280
developer certification program.

23:12.280 --> 23:19.720
Users will need to upload their programs to the Atari VCS submission portal for approval.

23:19.720 --> 23:23.880
If they blow this aspect and the fact that they don't have their crap together already

23:23.880 --> 23:28.240
with clear rules on what's going to work, what's not going to work, where the boundaries

23:28.240 --> 23:33.080
are and what it takes to get approved, the fact that they don't have that already is

23:33.080 --> 23:34.940
a big red flag.

23:34.940 --> 23:39.360
They can't come out here and tell you to start porting for their platform, but not tell you

23:39.360 --> 23:41.220
what the rules of the field are.

23:41.220 --> 23:44.620
That's ridiculous and it's a bad sign.

23:44.620 --> 23:47.520
And God only knows what those requirements are going to be.

23:47.520 --> 23:54.480
So why would anyone start working on an application or a game for this platform without knowing

23:54.480 --> 23:55.480
what those requirements are?

23:55.480 --> 24:01.840
That is a very good point, but the way I read it was that it's more of a formality really.

24:01.840 --> 24:06.980
It's just to keep out those really dreadful games where you just do all sorts of terrible

24:06.980 --> 24:12.440
things and real not-safe-for-work stuff and just to make sure that there is at least some

24:12.440 --> 24:16.600
barrier of entry, some correlation happening here.

24:16.600 --> 24:20.780
That has been essentially the implication, but now is the time where you got to put it

24:20.780 --> 24:21.780
down into writing.

24:21.780 --> 24:26.280
Make it clear because now you're asking for developers to spend their time porting their

24:26.280 --> 24:30.420
application to Linux or whatever it might take, even if that's just for some people

24:30.420 --> 24:33.920
checking a box in Unity and then testing it, they still need to know.

24:33.920 --> 24:34.920
It's still worth their time.

24:34.920 --> 24:38.280
Unless they have to understand what the upside is for them.

24:38.280 --> 24:41.240
Now they're making a pretty sweet royalty deal here.

24:41.240 --> 24:48.280
Developers will receive 88% royalty on all Atari VCS exclusive titles or 80% royalty

24:48.280 --> 24:50.280
on non-exclusive titles.

24:50.280 --> 24:54.780
That's still very generous, 80% royalty on non-exclusive titles.

24:54.780 --> 24:58.380
That's of course just for ones that are approved and then placed in the VCS store.

24:58.380 --> 25:04.440
So they could get this, a nice looking box, goes in the living room, has a good Linux

25:04.440 --> 25:05.440
OS underneath it.

25:05.440 --> 25:10.400
So there's always future potential and a good GUI with Atari branding and an Atari store

25:10.400 --> 25:15.360
that makes it easy to get this stuff at a reasonable price with reasonable store rules.

25:15.360 --> 25:18.480
It could work for folks like myself and Holder.

25:18.480 --> 25:20.680
I could see the appeal.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.240
It's just going to come down to those rules now and they got to get them out there as

25:23.240 --> 25:24.240
fast as possible.

25:24.240 --> 25:27.040
So that way everybody understands what the rules of the field are.

25:27.040 --> 25:31.320
Well, we're not doing our predictions for a couple of episodes, but let's do a quick

25:31.320 --> 25:32.800
bonus one here.

25:32.800 --> 25:38.200
Prediction, do you think that you will receive your VCS in 2020?

25:38.200 --> 25:39.200
I do.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.200
I do think I will.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.200
Yes.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.200
All right.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.200
I'm going to say that you won't then.

25:43.200 --> 25:44.200
Really?

25:44.200 --> 25:47.320
I say because they've made this thing just a standard PC now, it really comes down to

25:47.320 --> 25:51.200
the UI on top of Linux and getting the case all dialed in.

25:51.200 --> 25:55.560
And then the rest is all on the services side, app store, developers, relationships, but

25:55.560 --> 25:56.560
the hardware could ship.

25:56.560 --> 25:59.520
It might not ship with a lot of games, but I think the hardware is pretty close.

25:59.520 --> 26:00.520
Yeah.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.760
You can install a proper Linux distro on it then, eh?

26:02.760 --> 26:06.520
I mean, Debian would be pretty great, but I'd love to, I mean, if nothing else, just

26:06.520 --> 26:09.520
use it as a Linux box for a little while and then have it as a keepsake.

26:09.520 --> 26:15.120
I have a couple of classic computers that to me are iconic and that would be one of

26:15.120 --> 26:16.120
them.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.120
What a crazy idea.

26:17.120 --> 26:21.980
I just feel like it's, if nothing else, I'll just appreciate it as a museum piece one day.

26:21.980 --> 26:24.080
But if I ever do get it, I'll let you know.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.720
And of course, if anything else develops in the world, we'll be covering it.

26:26.720 --> 26:31.080

26:38.140 --> 26:40.440
I am at Chris LAS.

26:40.440 --> 26:42.040
I'm at Charles Rissington.

26:42.040 --> 26:43.040
