Welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on the free and open source world. This is

00:16.080 --> 00:19.960
episode one, recorded May 14th, 2017. I'm Chris.

00:19.960 --> 00:20.960
And I'm Joe.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.520
Hey Joe, happy Mother's Day.

00:22.520 --> 00:25.360
Oh yeah, it's Mother's Day in America, not in England though.

00:25.360 --> 00:29.320
No, but I just felt like I should just wish you a happy Mother's Day for our first episode.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.320
Fair enough.

00:30.320 --> 00:34.080
We have so many interesting stories this week, we couldn't have picked a better week to start.

00:34.080 --> 00:38.160
And I think maybe what might be one of our largest stories for a while is what's happening

00:38.160 --> 00:44.660
at Canonical. And this week, Mark Shuttleworth, in an interview at OpenStack Summit, talked

00:44.660 --> 00:50.680
about Canonical's path to an IPO. And this could be a massive shift for Canonical, Joe.

00:50.680 --> 00:55.080
Well, this already is that we've seen it over the last few weeks, haven't we? And as you

00:55.080 --> 00:58.200
say, this is the perfect time to start the show because this is, I would say, probably

00:58.200 --> 01:02.440
the biggest story in Linux for five years, maybe longer than that.

01:02.440 --> 01:08.440
You know, Joe, I think people don't realize how big of a story this is yet because things

01:08.440 --> 01:13.240
are still transitioning. There's some things that are still happening that haven't fully

01:13.240 --> 01:17.600
clicked into place yet. And it's going to be a massive shift for this company, a massive

01:17.600 --> 01:22.160
shift for the Linux desktop. And if Canonical goes for the IPO, that means a big shift in

01:22.160 --> 01:26.920
what the company focuses on. It's going to be less altruistic type things and more does

01:26.920 --> 01:28.560
this make a profit type things.

01:28.560 --> 01:33.360
Well, yeah, this whole idea that they were this family, it wasn't a proper company, was

01:33.360 --> 01:39.120
it? It was this kind of super happy fun time FOSS family that was, you know, made a few

01:39.120 --> 01:43.720
pounds here and there, but wasn't too bothered about it and was interested in software freedom.

01:43.720 --> 01:48.320
Whereas now, it seems like Shuttleworth has just realized that he's not going to make

01:48.320 --> 01:54.280
money from the desktop. The desktop is not going to be a success financially. And he's

01:54.280 --> 01:56.640
just decided to cash out by the sounds of things.

01:56.640 --> 02:01.360
I don't I don't know if I don't know if that's true. I actually would I would actually disagree

02:01.360 --> 02:06.420
with you just to a bit. I think it's ironically the desktops probably making Canonical more

02:06.420 --> 02:10.840
revenue right now than it ever has. Based on my conversations with Mr. Barton George

02:10.840 --> 02:16.360
at Dell, they're seeing 100% year over year growth on those desktops. And to the point

02:16.360 --> 02:22.840
where in India and China, half the machines sold are running Ubuntu. It's and here's

02:22.840 --> 02:28.000
the thing, Joe, I don't know any of the details. But according to Barton, every single one

02:28.000 --> 02:33.480
of those machines has a support contract paid by Dell to Canonical.

02:33.480 --> 02:39.040
Right. So there is revenue coming in there. So therefore, you have to ask yourself, why

02:39.040 --> 02:43.920
are they abandoning Unity? Okay, you can see why they abandoned Unity 8 and convergence

02:43.920 --> 02:48.100
because that wasn't making them any money. But Unity 7 on the desktop is making the money.

02:48.100 --> 02:50.040
So why are they making the shift to GNOME?

02:50.040 --> 02:55.720
I think it's pretty clear that there was a realization at the upper levels of Canonical

02:55.720 --> 02:59.040
that they weren't going to change anyone's mind. I think that's an exasperation we're

02:59.040 --> 03:02.840
seeing. It's an exasperation. All right, you know what we're going to do, we're just going

03:02.840 --> 03:08.000
to disengage and just make let this make money. In fact, Joe, in some ways, it's it's parallel

03:08.000 --> 03:11.960
to what Apple is doing with the Macs. They're just sitting there in milking an existing

03:11.960 --> 03:17.100
market while they focus on the things that make money, iOS, iPhone, services, things

03:17.100 --> 03:21.600
like that. Canonical is going to do the same thing. They're going to ship a desktop, and

03:21.600 --> 03:25.800
they may even invest some time and engineering into it. But it's not going to be their own

03:25.800 --> 03:30.180
whole creation like it was in the past. Instead, they're going to spend their time innovating

03:30.180 --> 03:33.960
on things like snap packages, things that they can do to be more competitive in open

03:33.960 --> 03:38.560
stack space, things that they can do to be more competitive in containers in the cloud,

03:38.560 --> 03:42.760
they're going to double down on LXD, those areas where they're making money, IoT, that's

03:42.760 --> 03:46.180
going to be what they focus on. And they're just going to sit here and bring revenue in

03:46.180 --> 03:49.800
from the desktop, and they're going to ship a no just a vanilla gnome desktop. That's my

03:49.800 --> 03:50.960
cynical view of it.

03:50.960 --> 03:55.120
Well, yeah, basically, they're abandoning the desktop to the community. Meanwhile, they're

03:55.120 --> 04:00.920
going to still make some revenue off it by the sounds of things. And why bother to spend

04:00.920 --> 04:06.280
valuable resources on an engineering team for the desktop when Ubuntu gnome is doing

04:06.280 --> 04:11.040
it for free for you when you can just co-opt them? That mean you talked about being cynical.

04:11.040 --> 04:16.640
I mean, how is that for cynical?

04:16.640 --> 04:21.800
Oh, geez. Yeah. Although, did you see that before all of this big news about dropping

04:21.800 --> 04:25.800
unity and switching to gnome came down? Did you see that? I think it was Dustin Kirkland.

04:25.800 --> 04:29.360
I might be wrong on the attribution, but I'm pretty sure it was Dustin that went on Hacker

04:29.360 --> 04:34.680
News and started a thread asking the always interactive folks over at hackernews.com what

04:34.680 --> 04:40.400
they wanted from the Ubuntu desktop. And on the top of the list is just ship us a standard

04:40.400 --> 04:42.120
gnome desktop. Did you see that?

04:42.120 --> 04:45.920
Yeah, that was interesting timing, wasn't it? That they basically just said ship Gnome

04:45.920 --> 04:50.520
and Wayland. And that's exactly what canonical turnaround and did well announced they were

04:50.520 --> 04:52.920
going to do about a week later.

04:52.920 --> 04:55.960
It's almost like they were putting feelers out there to see how people would react.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.280
They surely must have made the decision before that.

04:58.280 --> 05:02.480
I completely agree. But I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't just a let's double check the

05:02.480 --> 05:05.640
temperature of the market before we make this announcement.

05:05.640 --> 05:09.800
Yeah, yeah, maybe they were checking that people weren't saying, oh, we want unity eight

05:09.800 --> 05:14.680
finish unity eight, get it out the door. Whereas it seems that at least with, okay, it's a

05:14.680 --> 05:23.840
very specific part of the desktop users Hacker News, at least they want just standard gnome.

05:23.840 --> 05:25.480
And well, that's what they're going to get.

05:25.480 --> 05:30.100
Well, Joe, can I float another idea past you too? So when we look at that Hacker News discussion

05:30.100 --> 05:34.200
thread, which got a ton of traction, and we look at who's buying Dell Sputnik laptops,

05:34.200 --> 05:38.400
and we look at who's buying Galago Pros, I think a large selection of them are that quote

05:38.400 --> 05:43.120
unquote, web developer, that developer who wants to run on their laptop the same environment

05:43.120 --> 05:46.720
they run in production. And that's why bash on Windows doesn't work for them, because

05:46.720 --> 05:51.400
it needs to be exactly what they run in production. It really does make a difference. It really

05:51.400 --> 05:54.600
makes a difference for these people. And so for them, they're buying up these Sputnik

05:54.600 --> 05:59.200
laptops like crazy. And they're buying they're looking at system, system 76 machines and

05:59.200 --> 06:06.160
entryware machines with an entirely new set of interests now. And you have to wonder if

06:06.160 --> 06:11.680
these if these manufacturers aren't coming to canonical and saying, I need to plan the

06:11.680 --> 06:16.680
next year of products. And this Unity eight stuff you haven't you haven't shipped anything

06:16.680 --> 06:20.560
mirror hasn't shipped. I mean, it's shipped, but it's just been in testing, like Unity

06:20.560 --> 06:25.480
eight isn't ready yet. We need to plan our products we have, we have to plan things out

06:25.480 --> 06:32.160
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 18 months in advance. And right now, we're seeing demand for the gnome

06:32.160 --> 06:38.720
desktop. The fedora distribution can deliver that open Sousa can deliver that canonical,

06:38.720 --> 06:44.320
we want to work with you. But we're kind of we're a little hesitant about your path in

06:44.320 --> 06:49.320
your future. What do you have for us? Because the reason why I say that Joe is I saw a lot

06:49.320 --> 06:53.200
of machines at Dell running the gnome desktop, they weren't necessarily running Unity seven,

06:53.200 --> 06:58.680
it seems to be that there is a lot of momentum there. And so you think that that's why they

06:58.680 --> 07:04.960
have decided to finally kill unity then because they they've got this pressure from the OEM

07:04.960 --> 07:10.640
saying to them, people don't like unity, they want just standard stuff like gnome that you

07:10.640 --> 07:14.840
can get on all the other distros. Because one thing about Unity seven was, it wasn't

07:14.840 --> 07:20.160
very portable, was it? You kind of could run it on arch if you really wanted to, but you

07:20.160 --> 07:25.880
couldn't run it on any of the other distros. Whereas now, if you look at what's probably

07:25.880 --> 07:31.720
going to be stock Ubuntu and stock fedora, and the grown version of open Sousa, you've

07:31.720 --> 07:33.760
got a unified experience across those.

07:33.760 --> 07:38.320
Yeah, and I think a really inconvenient thing happened along the way to mobile is the desktop

07:38.320 --> 07:43.240
actually started getting some traction. Inconveniently, while canonical was focusing on building

07:43.240 --> 07:47.160
a great mobile experience, the desktop actually started making the company a significant amount

07:47.160 --> 07:51.720
of money. And so recently, what from what I can tell, it seems like they got really

07:51.720 --> 07:56.080
serious about unity eight on the desktop, but it was just too little too late. The the

07:56.080 --> 08:01.260
vendors, I believe, want something today. The the Linux end users that are developing

08:01.260 --> 08:05.280
on Linux and deploying in the cloud, they want something today. And we're not we're

08:05.280 --> 08:09.160
not really ready to wait around. In the meantime, it's not like MacBooks. And it's not like

08:09.160 --> 08:13.080
Windows 10 is sitting around both of them are getting better. And they're adding features

08:13.080 --> 08:15.800
that are more appealing to this to this particular developer market.

08:15.800 --> 08:20.000
Well, you say that the desktop was starting to gain traction there. Could that be because

08:20.000 --> 08:24.760
unity seven was mature, it was stable, it was working fine. And okay, I've never been

08:24.760 --> 08:29.000
a fan of it. But I speak to people who are and they say, okay, early on, it was a bit

08:29.000 --> 08:35.160
ropey, didn't work too well. Whereas towards the end now, in well, people who are using

08:35.160 --> 08:40.120
1604 are happily using it. It's very, very stable. I mean, I saw poppy saying that gnome

08:40.120 --> 08:45.880
shell is crashing on him. And it used to unity would crash maybe once a month, whereas he's

08:45.880 --> 08:48.680
had like two or three crashes a day with gnome.

08:48.680 --> 08:53.040
It's funny. It's gnome three has just started crashing on me on our OBS machine that we

08:53.040 --> 08:56.160
have here in the studio in the last couple of days. I don't know why. But all of a sudden,

08:56.160 --> 08:58.320
every few hours, it just reloads.

08:58.320 --> 09:04.160
Why the hell would you use gnome on such critical infrastructure as the OBS machine surely should

09:04.160 --> 09:09.360
be using XFC or LXD. So it's, you know, all the resources.

09:09.360 --> 09:13.040
Well, because unlike you, I try to skate to where the pucks gonna be. So that way I have

09:13.040 --> 09:17.000
very informed commentary right here on the show. So I live and breathe the gnome three

09:17.000 --> 09:20.760
desktop because let's be honest, that's where that that's where everybody's going. And I

09:20.760 --> 09:26.720
don't stay on XFC island like you do, Joe. I don't like XFC. I want the real desktop.

09:26.720 --> 09:31.200
I want the current desktop. I want when I say people should try Linux, I want the experience

09:31.200 --> 09:32.480
that they're going to get Joe.

09:32.480 --> 09:36.680
Well, yeah, that's why you can maybe use that on your laptop. But on critical infrastructure,

09:36.680 --> 09:39.780
man, I would not be using something as heavy as gnome.

09:39.780 --> 09:44.360
To tell you the truth, Joe, I can't really argue with you right now, because you're right.

09:44.360 --> 09:49.160
But I think it's sort of a deep irony, if you're also right about why, why maybe it's

09:49.160 --> 09:53.280
just getting successful right now is because of unity seven, I disagree with that premise.

09:53.280 --> 09:56.880
I don't think it's unity seven that's making the Linux desktop take off right now for these

09:56.880 --> 10:02.680
particular web dev type customer base, or whatever. I don't mean to categorize it as

10:02.680 --> 10:06.040
just web devs. But you have to understand that I've been talking to these companies,

10:06.040 --> 10:09.040
and that's who they're focusing at. And that's where they're actually seeing a lot of sales.

10:09.040 --> 10:12.040
And you know what they're doing, Joe, they're using the command line, they don't care what

10:12.040 --> 10:15.320
the UI is, they don't care if it's unity, they don't care if it's gnome, as long as

10:15.320 --> 10:18.760
they get a terminal, as long as they get Docker, as long as they get git and all of the same

10:18.760 --> 10:24.560
tools, they're happy. And it sort of doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how much time and

10:24.560 --> 10:28.560
effort canonical puts into unity eight, it doesn't matter if they keep unity seven going

10:28.560 --> 10:33.000
for the next 15 years. And it doesn't really matter if they just ship stock, no, because

10:33.000 --> 10:37.400
the reality is, everybody's just using the terminal, everybody's just using sublime text

10:37.400 --> 10:42.720
or atom or Visual Studio code or them. And it doesn't matter. And imagine if you could

10:42.720 --> 10:47.680
have all that stuff and your games as well. All the triple a title games on the same operating

10:47.680 --> 10:51.480
system. Oh, that would be super tempting. In fact, that would be so tempting. If there

10:51.480 --> 10:55.160
was something like that out there, Joe, I may never switch to another operating system.

10:55.160 --> 10:59.760
Hmm, yeah. I wonder if Microsoft maybe have thought of that. Hey, yeah, this was some

10:59.760 --> 11:04.000
big news from build conference this year. So last year, Microsoft announced the ability

11:04.000 --> 11:10.520
to run the Ubuntu environment like a bath shell on Windows. Now this year at build 2017,

11:10.520 --> 11:16.120
they have announced they're also bringing Sousa and Fedora. And along with that, they're

11:16.120 --> 11:20.340
also putting Ubuntu Fedora and Sousa in the Windows Store. So it's just like an app you

11:20.340 --> 11:25.360
install now from the Windows Store. And Bob's your uncle, you've got Linux right there on

11:25.360 --> 11:29.640
your Windows box. This will be coming in the fall Creators Update. What do you think, Joe?

11:29.640 --> 11:33.800
Well, I think what is key here is the fact that they're going to be in the Windows Store,

11:33.800 --> 11:38.120
which means that it's going to be on Windows 10 S, which is the lockdown one they're trying

11:38.120 --> 11:44.560
to sell to students because they realize that these students are going to need Linux. I

11:44.560 --> 11:50.600
mean, Microsoft has long since accepted, Microsoft loves Linux and all that stuff. They've long

11:50.600 --> 11:57.640
since accepted that in the cloud, Linux has won, but they don't want to lose the desktop

11:57.640 --> 12:01.720
because that's basically what they're hanging on to. I mean, they've got Azure and everything,

12:01.720 --> 12:06.680
but the desktop and Office and that's a big part of their business model. And so they

12:06.680 --> 12:11.440
don't want to lose it. And this is their way of doing that. They're incorporating what

12:11.440 --> 12:14.800
is effectively Linux, even though it's not Linux, is it? Because there's no Linux kernel,

12:14.800 --> 12:21.240
it's everything, it's sort of all the GNU stuff and all that. And they just want to

12:21.240 --> 12:25.760
keep people on Windows as much as possible. And you have to say it's a very smart play

12:25.760 --> 12:27.240
by them.

12:27.240 --> 12:33.800
Finally, finally, I can use proper NTFS with Linux, finally. I have to tell you, I have

12:33.800 --> 12:38.200
to tell you if I was stuck on Windows, like say I worked at a company that required Windows

12:38.200 --> 12:42.440
for some sort of network reason or for other reasons, I would be very thankful for this

12:42.440 --> 12:48.360
feature. And I'm very impressed that Microsoft is willing to do this. It does sort of alarm

12:48.360 --> 12:53.640
me a bit that it makes it less enticing to switch away. But I go back to, it truly makes

12:53.640 --> 12:57.760
a difference that you run on your test and dev machine, which you run in production.

12:57.760 --> 13:03.960
And so while it's cute and handy, and it makes Cygwin look like a product of the past, I

13:03.960 --> 13:06.640
don't really fear this. I don't really fear this.

13:06.640 --> 13:07.640
You hate it.

13:07.640 --> 13:14.440
Yeah, I don't. I tell you why, Joe. The problem is Windows 10. It really is shit, Joe. And

13:14.440 --> 13:19.200
I'm not just saying that because I like Linux. I recently tried it out again when I was testing

13:19.200 --> 13:23.720
out different video editors, and I had it on a 4K display. It's a joke, Joe. It's a

13:23.720 --> 13:30.000
real joke. It is laughable. When Apple ships a high DPI product, the entire operating system

13:30.000 --> 13:34.380
and all of the applications are high DPI because they control it all. Okay, I grok that. When

13:34.380 --> 13:40.100
Linux ships a high DPI product, some things that are GTK3 or QT5 look great in high DPI.

13:40.100 --> 13:44.000
And I understand why some things that are maybe older like your XFCE desktop look like

13:44.000 --> 13:50.960
total arse. But when Microsoft ships a high DPI desktop, their own stuff, like their own

13:50.960 --> 13:55.640
management interface is mixed. They have multiple control panels. They have 10 different ways

13:55.640 --> 14:01.380
to do things. They're bundling Cortana like it's going out of style. They have new ways

14:01.380 --> 14:07.760
of invading your privacy. In fact, one of my favorite ones is you can turn off ad personalization,

14:07.760 --> 14:12.240
but you cannot actually turn off ads in your start menu. And when you turn off ad personalization,

14:12.240 --> 14:17.600
it warns you and it says, by the way, you will still see ads. They just won't be personalized.

14:17.600 --> 14:21.040
That kind of stuff, Joe, the reason why I mentioned it is because it is the little things

14:21.040 --> 14:25.480
that grate against people's nerves that does compel them to buy a machine running Linux

14:25.480 --> 14:29.360
or to try installing Linux on their machine. And so while this stuff is great, and if I

14:29.360 --> 14:33.620
was stuck in a Windows world, I absolutely would use this. And I'm impressed that Microsoft's

14:33.620 --> 14:40.000
doing it. As a Linux user, I'm a little underwhelmed. First of all, is it SUSE? Is it open SUSE?

14:40.000 --> 14:44.280
Is it version, is it LEAP? Is it, what is it? And which version of Fedora is it? Is

14:44.280 --> 14:49.160
it Fedora 25? Is it Fedora 24? Is it Fedora Atomic? Is it Fedora Cloud based on version

14:49.160 --> 14:54.760
24? There's no information here. And one other thing I'll just happen to say is the day that

14:54.760 --> 14:59.680
Microsoft announced Ubuntu running on Windows, there were folks at Canonical that had the

14:59.680 --> 15:04.820
entire blog post up on how all of it works, about how they packaged it up, about the testing

15:04.820 --> 15:09.480
they did, about how the performance works. So as somebody who wanted to use this in production

15:09.480 --> 15:14.280
potentially, I totally grokked how it worked, how it worked for me, and what the potential

15:14.280 --> 15:17.560
limitations are. There has been nothing from SUSE or Fedora.

15:17.560 --> 15:21.680
Why do you suppose that is then? Do they just not really care about it? If Microsoft said

15:21.680 --> 15:28.180
to them, we want to use, you know, SUSE and we want to use Fedora with this Linux, Windows

15:28.180 --> 15:33.240
subsystem for Linux, and they've just said, yeah, okay, whatever, use it. And just they

15:33.240 --> 15:35.360
don't really give a shit about that.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.620
To be honest, I can't tell because in one sense, it could be good. Maybe they've modified

15:38.620 --> 15:42.800
the subsystem for Linux in such a way that any distro is possible, and so they just put

15:42.800 --> 15:47.160
these distros on there. Or they did, they worked directly with these different distributions

15:47.160 --> 15:51.480
and they're just choosing not to promote it because maybe some of them came out and shit

15:51.480 --> 15:55.280
all over Canonical in the past when they announced this feature. I don't know if you recall that,

15:55.280 --> 15:59.080
but there were folks that came out of the woodwork and shamed Canonical for doing this.

15:59.080 --> 16:02.760
And now some of those same people helped enable it for their distribution.

16:02.760 --> 16:07.380
Yeah, I mean, I would have thought that the licensing would mean that you'd have to kind

16:07.380 --> 16:11.000
of do a deal, wouldn't you? I don't suppose they could just ship it in Windows.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.280
The trademarking alone, right? You would think that the trademarking alone would be enough

16:14.280 --> 16:17.320
that they'd have to work out some sort of deal. But they're saying SUSE, so maybe it's

16:17.320 --> 16:22.020
SUSE Enterprise, which at that point, how many of you out there have SUSE Enterprise

16:22.020 --> 16:25.560
on your VPS? Raise your hand. Oh, none of you. Oh, okay. Well, how many of you have

16:25.560 --> 16:30.200
Fedora? Oh, okay. Yeah.

16:30.200 --> 16:34.160
Fedora is available for digital ocean, isn't it? I'm sure some people are using it.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.880
What do you think, though, of the joke I've seen passed around online now that it's truly

16:37.880 --> 16:42.800
the year of the Linux desktop because you can now run Linux on Windows? Does that sting?

16:42.800 --> 16:48.120
It's kind of true, isn't it? Yeah. You've got Chromebooks and these Windows S laptops

16:48.120 --> 16:53.880
covering a Windows 10 S, which are both basically Chromebook type devices, both of them running,

16:53.880 --> 17:01.080
well, one actually Linux and one everything but Linux. And so it kind of is really the

17:01.080 --> 17:04.720
year of Linux on a desktop, but just not as we thought it would be.

17:04.720 --> 17:08.160
I would put it differently. I would say it's the year of the Linux runtime. It's the year

17:08.160 --> 17:12.880
of the Linux runtime. And I think that's actually part of why our show is important because

17:12.880 --> 17:17.560
Linux now runs everywhere. As a developer, you can write for Linux now and you can run

17:17.560 --> 17:22.040
it on BSD. You can run it, of course, on Linux servers, which are the predominant web servers

17:22.040 --> 17:25.520
on the web. You can run it now on Windows. You can run it in virtualization. You can

17:25.520 --> 17:30.960
run it in Docker. It's truly the universal platform that doesn't have some crazy runtime

17:30.960 --> 17:31.960
around it.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.600
Yeah, I think that's fair to say.

17:33.600 --> 17:39.200
It's kind of amazing. Welcome to 2017, everybody, where Microsoft is shipping Fedora, SUSE, and

17:39.200 --> 17:44.280
Ubuntu in the Windows store, in the Windows App Store.

17:44.280 --> 17:45.280
Crazy.

17:45.280 --> 17:51.040
I want to take a moment and thank Ting for sponsoring this episode, our first episode

17:51.040 --> 17:55.840
of Linux Action News. Do me a favor and go to last.ting.com. It's a little retro and

17:55.840 --> 18:00.280
it's a little awesome, las.ting.com. It's a smarter way to do mobile and if you go to

18:00.280 --> 18:03.720
that URL, you'll save some money. What I love about Ting, I've been a customer for more

18:03.720 --> 18:09.760
than two and a half years, it's just pay for what you use wireless. And when I say this,

18:09.760 --> 18:13.240
it sounds like, oh, geez, Chris, that's a really neat idea. There must be a trick. And

18:13.240 --> 18:16.480
to some people, those would be people that live in the United States. And then there's

18:16.480 --> 18:21.280
a group of people like a lot of you outside the United States that go, well, isn't that

18:21.280 --> 18:23.680
kind of how, that's how my mobile works, Chris.

18:23.680 --> 18:29.060
You see, if the U.S. were to hit reset on the mobile market today, the Ting model would

18:29.060 --> 18:33.520
be the dominant model because it truly empowers the customer. If you've got Wi-Fi, there's

18:33.520 --> 18:37.480
no sense in paying for gigs and gigs and gigs and gigs of data. There's no reason to use

18:37.480 --> 18:41.640
that if you only need your data when you're driving from home to work or something like

18:41.640 --> 18:46.120
that. Same with calls. Now that Telegram has calling, I'm never making a phone call again.

18:46.120 --> 18:50.620
Now that the Echo has calling, I'm never making a phone call again. So why pay for minutes?

18:50.620 --> 18:54.880
You think I'm kidding. I'm not. Find out more by going to last.ting.com. They've got a brand

18:54.880 --> 18:59.240
new website. It looks super slick. It's pay for what you use wireless. And one of the

18:59.240 --> 19:02.840
other things that's cool, and I mentioned this because we kind of have, you'd be surprised,

19:02.840 --> 19:07.720
we kind of have a geeky audience. I know. I know. I wouldn't have thought so either.

19:07.720 --> 19:12.120
But it turns out we do. And so they understand that there's CDMA and GSM. At least here in

19:12.120 --> 19:16.700
the States, we've got both of them. We're maniacs like that. And on the Ting network,

19:16.700 --> 19:20.080
you can choose either one that's better in your area. Maybe one's better for calls. Maybe

19:20.080 --> 19:23.160
one's better for data. Or maybe one just makes you feel like a baller. Find out more by going

19:23.160 --> 19:28.040
to last.ting.com. They've got a bunch of great features, a great dashboard, and more. But

19:28.040 --> 19:33.480
I want you to take this away. It's $6 for the line, and then just your usage on top

19:33.480 --> 19:43.280
of that. last.ting.com. And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Action News.

19:43.280 --> 19:48.520
Just a quick headline for you guys this week. The OpenWRT and the LEED, our LEDE project,

19:48.520 --> 19:51.880
have agreed on a peace plan. I didn't realize that there was a split happening here, but

19:51.880 --> 19:56.600
I guess a set of core developers went off and started their own project from OpenWRT.

19:56.600 --> 20:00.120
So you didn't know about this either. I kind of felt a bit stupid reading about this. I

20:00.120 --> 20:01.320
should have known about it.

20:01.320 --> 20:04.440
No, I did not. And I guess things have actually worked out for the better. Some of the core

20:04.440 --> 20:08.280
developers are coming back. They're going to use the LEDE project as sort of the base,

20:08.280 --> 20:13.580
but they're going to keep the OpenWRT branding. It's sort of a kumbaya, Joe. So look forward

20:13.580 --> 20:19.720
to better firmwares on your edge devices soon. Speaking of edge devices, Google in Android

20:19.720 --> 20:24.400
O is finally going to solve a major issue with Android. But I suppose, Joe, the question

20:24.400 --> 20:25.800
is, does it go far enough?

20:25.800 --> 20:32.400
No, in a word. It solves one of three problems, doesn't it? With the whole updating Android

20:32.400 --> 20:39.000
situation where, first of all, you have to deal with the silicon manufacturers. So usually

20:39.000 --> 20:44.160
Samsung or Qualcomm. So you have to deal with them first. Then you have to deal with the

20:44.160 --> 20:48.760
actual phone manufacturers. And then you have to deal with the carriers. So you've got these

20:48.760 --> 20:55.760
three steps that have to be dealt with before you can push out an over-the-air update. And

20:55.760 --> 21:02.100
so Project Treble is going to make that a little bit easier because it's basically separating

21:02.100 --> 21:09.160
the first layer of that off. So the code coming from the silicon manufacturers can stay the

21:09.160 --> 21:12.920
same. And then everything on top of that can change.

21:12.920 --> 21:16.620
Another way to frame that would be, now the silicon manufacturers don't have to be bothered

21:16.620 --> 21:19.440
before everybody else in the stack can do an Android update.

21:19.440 --> 21:23.100
Well, yeah, which is good. It's definitely a step forward. There's no doubt about it.

21:23.100 --> 21:26.040
One of the things I didn't realize was such an issue, but apparently it's a big issue

21:26.040 --> 21:30.980
in the Android ecosystem, is Qualcomm only certifies updating their chips, the drivers

21:30.980 --> 21:36.160
for it and firmwares and whatnot for two years. Two years. And then, sorry, we're all done.

21:36.160 --> 21:40.840
Well, that two-year cycle is basically the standard cycle in mobile, isn't it? Because

21:40.840 --> 21:43.600
after two years, you've upgraded your phone, in theory.

21:43.600 --> 21:48.400
In theory. Meanwhile, iOS devices, see, here's why I disagree with that. I disagree with

21:48.400 --> 21:53.760
that because they get passed down. Like, especially in families, you pass your devices down, they

21:53.760 --> 21:57.720
become gaming devices. They're still on the network. They still have your personal information

21:57.720 --> 22:02.640
on them. In some cases, now they're used by children. So that's why iOS devices with a

22:02.640 --> 22:07.480
five-year support cycle are much better for families where they want to do a pass down

22:07.480 --> 22:08.480
thing.

22:08.480 --> 22:12.080
Yeah. And if you just want to buy, I mean, buying an iPhone is an expensive endeavor

22:12.080 --> 22:16.600
and buying a Pixel phone is an expensive endeavor if you buy it outright and not through your

22:16.600 --> 22:23.700
carrier, right? And so you want to make that investment work. You want to be able to use

22:23.700 --> 22:28.060
it for several years, not just like two years or even less than that if you've only bought

22:28.060 --> 22:29.560
it like halfway through the cycle.

22:29.560 --> 22:33.200
Right. And the Pixel is one of the first devices. In fact, if you already have the Android O

22:33.200 --> 22:38.800
developer preview, you already have this, in theory. Also, I think it's worth mentioning,

22:38.800 --> 22:43.280
this doesn't solve the carrier problem or the OEM problem, which I think is the core

22:43.280 --> 22:47.960
problem. If the OEMs like Samsung or LG or HTC were truly motivated to support these

22:47.960 --> 22:51.640
devices for longer, something tells me that that would be worked into their contract with

22:51.640 --> 22:57.160
Qualcomm. They would be pressuring the devices manufacturers. They would be working on the

22:57.160 --> 23:02.800
software stack. There's been no motivation at the hardware manufacturer layer for the

23:02.800 --> 23:07.200
entire time of Android, which is a core problem because they want you to buy new devices.

23:07.200 --> 23:11.360
Same at the carrier level. Here, at least in the States, it's within their best interest

23:11.360 --> 23:16.180
for you to buy new devices. All the carriers now are offering plans where you just pay

23:16.180 --> 23:21.760
a monthly price. Lease that phone, friend. Lease that phone and every 18 months you get

23:21.760 --> 23:26.260
a brand new phone. Just keep upgrading, my friend, and then we can push you new services,

23:26.260 --> 23:30.500
new network features, all kinds of upsell services that make them lots of money and

23:30.500 --> 23:35.520
help them brand the device. So it's in everybody's interest to have you buy new devices.

23:35.520 --> 23:40.720
Yeah. And can I point out a potential problem here? It's only a potential problem, but if

23:40.720 --> 23:46.220
you are leaving the code from the silicon manufacturers there untouched, well that doesn't

23:46.220 --> 23:51.020
necessarily help you in terms of security because what if there are zero days or whatever

23:51.020 --> 23:56.760
found in that code? And if Qualcomm have decided that they're not supporting it anymore, then

23:56.760 --> 24:02.260
yeah, okay, you can go and upgrade the Android stack and make that more secure. But if the

24:02.260 --> 24:06.560
fundamental code run in the silicon has got vulnerabilities that are not being patched,

24:06.560 --> 24:08.480
then this doesn't help that either.

24:08.480 --> 24:13.560
I would say stay tuned. Another shoe could drop at Google IO on May 17th. May 17th through

24:13.560 --> 24:17.680
the 19th is Google IO. So it's coming up very soon. This is sort of like a pre-announcement

24:17.680 --> 24:21.880
and we could hear other parts that make it all click at Google IO. So that has to be

24:21.880 --> 24:26.960
kept in mind. But right now, this is only step one in a three-step process. And in some

24:26.960 --> 24:31.900
sense, Joe, it really doesn't make any sense unless you consider where Google may be going

24:31.900 --> 24:33.680
with things like Project Fuchsia.

24:33.680 --> 24:40.680
Yeah, exactly. So Project Fuchsia is their backup plan, I suppose, their mobile backup

24:40.680 --> 24:47.200
plan, which is a completely different OS. It doesn't use Linux. It doesn't have the

24:47.200 --> 24:50.520
Java virtual machine. It doesn't have all of the baggage of Android.

24:50.520 --> 24:57.240
Right. It's licensed under BSD clause 3, MIT, and Apache 2.0. No GPL.

24:57.240 --> 25:02.520
Exactly. Right. Which is something that Google, I mean, they've never been a huge fan of the

25:02.520 --> 25:10.800
GPL. Let's face it. So the OS is called Fuchsia and the kernel is called Magenta and the kernel

25:10.800 --> 25:16.640
is MIT licensed. And so this has been around for quite a while, but it's caused a bit of

25:16.640 --> 25:25.880
a stir in the last week because of a demo that has surfaced with a UI called Armadillo,

25:25.880 --> 25:30.160
which you can actually run on Android. And it's not complete at all, is it? I mean, it's

25:30.160 --> 25:34.920
basically a skeleton of UI at this stage, but it does show that Google have not forgotten

25:34.920 --> 25:40.320
about Fuchsia. Google are still working on it. And it's going to be open source, but

25:40.320 --> 25:44.440
it's going to be that different kind of open source, isn't it, than Linux? It's going to

25:44.440 --> 25:50.320
be the permissively licensed open source, which is better for, well, it's an easier

25:50.320 --> 25:52.940
sell, isn't it, for big business.

25:52.940 --> 25:57.620
It's corporate empire friendly. And when you look at this, it's really a landing spot for

25:57.620 --> 26:02.520
some of their favorite projects. Dart is in on this thing to give you high-performance

26:02.520 --> 26:07.400
graphics. They have Vulkan for the rendering. They have Escher, which is volumetric soft

26:07.400 --> 26:12.480
shadows for some of their UI stuff. This is high-end GUI stuff. It's like their fantasy

26:12.480 --> 26:16.800
project stuff. Now, all of this is neat and interesting. And with Google, some of this

26:16.800 --> 26:20.600
stuff could go nowhere. They often launch products that compete with each other. Like

26:20.600 --> 26:25.240
for years, the conversation is, well, Android and Chrome merge because they seem to be competing.

26:25.240 --> 26:29.960
That's not unusual for Google. When you look at Project Treble and consider Fuchsia, it

26:29.960 --> 26:34.220
could be that Treble would allow them to abstract away the hardware stuff, abstract away the

26:34.220 --> 26:38.500
hardware drivers, and move over to Fuchsia without a whole bunch of device problems.

26:38.500 --> 26:43.360
So at least Google's own devices, like the Pixel, maybe a Nexus device, could run Fuchsia.

26:43.360 --> 26:47.260
But what about the problem of applications? I mean, that's always been the problem with

26:47.260 --> 26:52.360
these new Linux-based operating systems, right, for the mobile. They don't have that wealth

26:52.360 --> 26:55.900
of apps. I mean, there are millions and millions or a billion apps or whatever it is available

26:55.900 --> 27:01.080
for Android. They're going to have to either convince everyone to rewrite their app to

27:01.080 --> 27:05.600
work with Fuchsia, or they're going to have to write some sort of compatibility layer.

27:05.600 --> 27:08.480
I hope it's the first one. I hope people...

27:08.480 --> 27:09.480
So do I.

27:09.480 --> 27:13.760
You know, wouldn't that be great if Android apps were all of a sudden 120 frames per second

27:13.760 --> 27:17.560
just flying around and had great graphics and just loaded really smooth?

27:17.560 --> 27:18.560
I mean, we have...

27:18.560 --> 27:19.560
And didn't crash all the time.

27:19.560 --> 27:23.080
Right. I mean, we have supercomputers in these phones, at least compared to when I was growing

27:23.080 --> 27:26.600
up and now looking at these devices. I don't understand why they're so slow.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.600
Yeah.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.600
Yeah.

27:28.600 --> 27:33.960
So Fuchsia, it feels like one of these fascinating Skunk Works projects, but we don't really...

27:33.960 --> 27:37.880
At least I won't speak for you, Joe, but I don't really have any expectations it's going

27:37.880 --> 27:38.960
to go anywhere.

27:38.960 --> 27:43.840
I do. I do think it is going to go somewhere because that's how Google does things. They

27:43.840 --> 27:47.720
always hedge their bets, don't they? They will never just have one product for things

27:47.720 --> 27:53.480
or very, very seldom. And eventually one will win out and they'll kill the other one. But

27:53.480 --> 27:58.360
I mean, just look at their messaging fiasco at the moment. How many ways have you got

27:58.360 --> 28:00.320
to send someone a message through Google?

28:00.320 --> 28:04.120
Oh, you're getting me worked up right now just thinking about it. Yeah. Allo, you have

28:04.120 --> 28:08.560
Allo, Duo, Hangouts, of course. I mean, there's so many. Yeah. And then of course there's

28:08.560 --> 28:14.920
Google Doc Chat. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, maybe, maybe something will be announced next

28:14.920 --> 28:18.840
week, or this week, May 17th. Maybe something will be announced at Google IO Keynote. They'll

28:18.840 --> 28:22.460
just be unbelievable. I don't really expect that you and I are going to talk a lot about

28:22.460 --> 28:27.320
mobile and Android on this show. This is go figure as we're launching the show. This is

28:27.320 --> 28:30.920
the big news right now. So we're talking about it now, but I don't know, Joe. I think down

28:30.920 --> 28:35.080
the road you and I probably won't be talking about it much. That's my instinct. I could

28:35.080 --> 28:38.480
be totally wrong. And of course this is going to be the week that will prove me wrong.

28:38.480 --> 28:42.720
I don't know, man. I have to disagree with that. The way I see it, the desktop, okay,

28:42.720 --> 28:45.960
it's never going to go away. Of course, you're always going to have people using it on the

28:45.960 --> 28:54.000
desktop, be it Windows, Mac OS or Linux, hopefully. But we have seen the growth of mobile and

28:54.000 --> 28:59.320
it's not going away. And hopefully Linux is going to continue to be a big part of that.

28:59.320 --> 29:04.480
But I think that while people are primarily using Android devices or mobile devices at

29:04.480 --> 29:10.760
least, we've got to talk about that. We can't ignore the reality that desktop Linux like

29:10.760 --> 29:14.080
desktop computing generally is on the wane.

29:14.080 --> 29:18.400
It hurts, but I think you're right. I have more and more people in my personal life that

29:18.400 --> 29:22.080
when they go home, they don't have a computer. They just use their mobile device.

29:22.080 --> 29:27.880
Well, you're talking to one of them now, Chris, I'm afraid. Yeah, seriously. Okay. I have

29:27.880 --> 29:32.400
my desktop, I have a ton of laptops, but my primary device is my Android phone running

29:32.400 --> 29:35.480
Lineage on this, because it's always with me.

29:35.480 --> 29:41.480
You want to know something funny? My middle child, Abigail, this weekend said to us, how

29:41.480 --> 29:46.360
come you guys don't have to pay for your home? And we said, what do you mean? We pay for

29:46.360 --> 29:51.000
our home? No, no. When my mommy pays for home, she uses her computer, but you don't have

29:51.000 --> 29:56.380
a computer here. So you don't pay for your home. And we said, no, trust us. We pay, we

29:56.380 --> 30:00.640
just don't use a computer to do it. And that's when I realized, yeah, most of the time when

30:00.640 --> 30:03.560
I'm at home, there's not even, there might be a laptop in a bag somewhere, but there's

30:03.560 --> 30:08.000
no computer set up at home anymore on it on when I'm at home and I'm not working anymore

30:08.000 --> 30:12.560
because I have, I have connectivity on my television. I have my phone, I have tablets.

30:12.560 --> 30:17.120
So Joe, while I want to sit here and disagree with you, the reality, even in my own home

30:17.120 --> 30:21.760
would say otherwise. Yep, exactly. Now I would love to hear your thoughts on anything we

30:21.760 --> 30:26.560
talked about or that particular subject. You can go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact

30:26.560 --> 30:31.200
to send us in your feedback or just email us directly news at jupiterbroadcasting.com

30:31.200 --> 30:38.680
or you can tweet us at linuxactionnews.com with stories or feedback. Yeah. And also the

30:38.680 --> 30:45.920
new Jupiter Broadcasting Telegram group. Bit dot L Y slash J B Telegram. Bit dot L Y slash

30:45.920 --> 30:50.480
J B Telegram. We just launched it. We're only telling you guys it's a Linux action news

30:50.480 --> 30:55.480
secret bit dot L Y slash J B Telegram. If you want to get on the official Jupiter Broadcasting

30:55.480 --> 31:00.840
Telegram group and there is something you can do to help the show out, subscribing your

31:00.840 --> 31:05.160
favorite podcast player. If you or even just a few of you do it this week, it'll help with

31:05.160 --> 31:09.080
discovery because the way it works is they got these crazy python scripts. When you subscribe,

31:09.080 --> 31:13.560
the numbers count up, boop, boop, boop, and even 10, 30, 40 of you do it and we'll move

31:13.560 --> 31:17.120
way up in the charts and people will find this new show. You can actually help us out

31:17.120 --> 31:22.220
this week by subscribing. We have links to all of them and all of the subscription services

31:22.220 --> 31:27.520
at linuxactionnews.com. Maybe not all of them, but pretty close. And you know what, Chris?

31:27.520 --> 31:33.240
The dirty secret of a lot of our listeners is that they use iTunes. What? Yeah. And you

31:33.240 --> 31:38.000
know, even if, even if you don't want to admit it, we won't tell anybody, but there is another

31:38.000 --> 31:43.960
dirty secret. You are our potential white knights. We need them here at the Linux action

31:43.960 --> 31:49.000
news. Of course you can save us by reviewing or rating an iTunes. You actually don't only

31:49.000 --> 31:54.040
juice iTunes for us, but you juice like a dozen other podcast directories who all just

31:54.040 --> 32:00.160
scrape iTunes. That's why iTunes is the bosses. Many, many podcast players, websites and apps

32:00.160 --> 32:03.660
are actually just scraping iTunes. And if you rate and review in there, you can help

32:03.660 --> 32:07.400
us out a bunch and not a lot of you want to even admit to using iTunes. So if you're one

32:07.400 --> 32:11.420
of them, please consider doing it right then. I suppose that'll do it for this episode.

32:11.420 --> 32:15.720
So we'll see you again next Monday. Be sure to go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe

32:15.720 --> 32:18.880
for all of our feed links and thanks for joining us guys. See you later.
