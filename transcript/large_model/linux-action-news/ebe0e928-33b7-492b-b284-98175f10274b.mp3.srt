00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,520
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 136, recorded on December 15th, 2019.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,520
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,520
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,520
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,680
Good to be connected with you over Microsoft Teams this, okay, not really, but we do start

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,240
out with a big announcement from Microsoft this week.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,760
Yes, Microsoft Teams is available on Linux.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,120
There's a deb file in an RPM, and I'm sure everyone rushed out to install it straight

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,120
away.

10
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,160
We obviously need another chat client for Linux, clearly, but joking aside, this is

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:40,880
still kind of a big deal, simply as it seems to be the first official Office 365 application

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,240
for Linux.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,640
In a way, this had to be the first one because all of the other applications will sort of

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,940
wrap into this.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,680
And I say other applications because Microsoft themselves is directly hinting that this is

16
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,480
the beginning of Office 365 coming for Linux.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,960
If we have an episode where we're announcing Word is available for Linux, or Excel is available

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,560
for Linux, even if it's an Electron app, I'm having a shot on the show or something.

19
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,380
We have to celebrate that.

20
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,360
That would be mind-blowing to previous past Chris.

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,920
Yeah, and past most people, really.

22
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:20,920
They do say Microsoft Teams client is the first Microsoft 365 app that's coming to Linux

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
desktops.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,440
So, that heavily implies that you're right.

25
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,440
The rest of them will be coming, presumably, in 2020.

26
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,680
The other thing that they make pretty clear in this post, which we'll have linked in the

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:38,560
show notes at linuxactionnews.com, this is something that their customers asked for.

28
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,540
This is in response to customer demand, which I think we should just let that have a moment.

29
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,540
That's really impressive.

30
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:51,160
They have a quote on here from Jimmy Beckman, who is in charge of personal products for

31
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:59,580
Volvo, he writes, quote, at Volvo Cars, Linux is being used by many users in several departments.

32
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:04,500
Until now, our Linux users have largely been stuck on a collaboration island with different

33
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,440
unofficial and unsupported clients for Skype business, and more recently, Microsoft Teams.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,880
But with Teams for Linux from Microsoft, we have been able to leave that island and collaborate

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,080
across our different platforms with full functionality with a rich client.

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,680
That's amazing and they say that this is a huge improvement for them because number one,

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,180
they can now do reliable screen sharing with other members of Volvo from their Linux desktops.

38
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,440
There are six things I like about that statement.

39
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,060
And number one, with a bullet on that list is, it blows my mind that it is now Microsoft

40
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,200
software that is making it possible for those Linux users in different companies to actually

41
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,120
run the Linux desktop.

42
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,240
In my day, that was the current I was constantly fighting.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,980
I was trying to solve exchange and word compatibility constantly.

44
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,600
And now it's Microsoft software with Visual Studio Code, which is the one that came to

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:07,400
mind first, and now things like Teams that is making it possible for people to choose

46
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
to run Linux.

47
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Wow, Joe.

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,120
I mean, that just really, that's number one on my list.

49
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,160
There's five others.

50
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,600
It's not a huge surprise to me.

51
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,640
If you really think about the long term trend, it kind of almost goes back to Apple giving

52
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,480
away the macOS updates for free and setting that precedent that operating systems are

53
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,600
free of cost.

54
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,900
And so Microsoft had to follow suit with that.

55
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,520
And they don't really care what operating system you're using now as long as you're

56
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,800
connecting to their services and paying for 365 and developers are paying for Azure.

57
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,960
What does it matter to them whether using Windows 10 or Ubuntu?

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
I absolutely agree.

59
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:50,840
I might argue that the pressure from free and open source software operating systems

60
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,000
sort of forced Apple's hand and Microsoft's hand.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But you're right.

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,360
As far as commercial OS's go, I kind of follow what you're saying there.

63
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,840
It's all about the services.

64
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,480
All roads lead to Azure, et cetera, et cetera.

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,620
However, there is a practical difference when you start combining all of it.

66
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,640
When you look at.NET Core, when you look at PowerShell for Linux, when you look at

67
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,760
Visual Studio Code and now Teams, there is a suite of software that is maintained by

68
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,800
Microsoft that makes it possible to run Linux desktop.

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,880
And I mentioned Visual Studio Code specifically because that's something that I, in the last

70
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,560
three months, have started using pretty seriously and just think it's a really fantastic editor.

71
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,460
And just last week, because I've kind of been doing it in baby steps, I learned that it

72
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,640
allows me to edit my system files and it will prompt for my pseudo password so I don't have

73
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,240
to run code as root.

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Man, it's just, it feels like a first class editor on Linux.

75
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,840
And I was thinking like if I were ever to leave Linux and switch to a Mac OS desktop

76
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,760
or like a Windows 10 desktop of some future iteration, I would still take Visual Studio

77
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760
Code with me.

78
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,160
I would still take Vivaldi with me.

79
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,520
I would take a couple of these key applications and I could see others that would take other

80
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,560
applications they make like PowerShell and.NET Core, et cetera.

81
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,800
It really is a, it's a new era where all of these things are kind of coming together and

82
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,040
they're making a real actual measurable contribution.

83
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,760
And I mean, I just can't even believe these words about come out of my mouth.

84
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,040
I think my Linux desktop is better thanks to software made by Microsoft today.

85
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Wow.

86
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
I know.

87
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,080
Hate mail to Chris, please, not me.

88
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,120
Alan at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

89
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,320
I know it's crazy to my brain, but it's true.

90
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,280
I really have found Visual Studio Code as I've gotten into Docker and editing YAML files

91
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,480
and it's marked down support, it's just a great app.

92
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,600
We talked last week about Ubuntu Pro for AWS and how a big part of that was the compliance

93
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
story.

94
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,280
Well, again, compliance is at the heart of this, I think.

95
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,160
If your organization says that you have to use Microsoft Teams to be compliant, which

96
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,400
is the reality for a lot of enterprises, and you have to use Edge, the browser, we're getting

97
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,520
close to a point where you can do that on Linux.

98
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,120
And that, I think, is the real key here.

99
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,520
If you're going to deploy Linux at scale in the enterprise on the desktop, you need to

100
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,880
have that compliance story straight.

101
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,040
Or even if it's not at scale, Joe, I mean, even if it's just 20, 15, 30 people, they're

102
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,680
now able to fully collaborate.

103
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,880
Yeah, true.

104
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,640
So this is good news.

105
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,720
Even if you're not going to use Teams, which I'm not going to, I have no interest in using

106
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,800
Office 365, quite frankly, but it is going to benefit all of us because it will ultimately

107
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,000
mean more users of the Linux desktop.

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yeah.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,520
I got an email from a listener who works at Microsoft, and he runs Linux all day, every

110
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,520
day.

111
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,700
And he said, you know, I've been testing this for a while, and let me tell you, just here

112
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,680
at Microsoft, this is going to make a big difference in my day-to-day job.

113
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,240
And I haven't asked him specifically, but I've got the impression that there is more

114
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:09,120
than a handful of people that are running Linux full-time at Microsoft.

115
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,160
The individual I was speaking to is running Gentoo at Microsoft, so you just never know

116
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
where it's going to go.

117
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,280
I mean, good for them.

118
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,520
Teams looks really great.

119
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,480
However, I'm all about the Zulip hype.

120
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,320
Yeah, there was a release this week of Zulip 2.1, which is somewhat like Slack and Mattermost

121
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:33,360
and Teams, but it has this kind of unique feature in that it has topic-based threading.

122
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,720
Now, I have to admit something here, until this week, I'd never heard of Zulip.

123
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Okay, all right.

124
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,080
All right, I have to admit I did not know of it either.

125
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,400
But it looks really cool.

126
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,880
I mean, like everything else is just completely inadequate now compared to Zulip.

127
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,320
They talk about a couple of things in here that really resonate with me.

128
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,200
But the other thing I kind of grok when reading through this was, this could be a perfect

129
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,640
solution for open-source projects that want to move away from mailing lists, but they

130
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,880
don't want to go into some sort of weird Apple-only chat ecosystem, because Zulip has some really

131
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:16,200
nice export to HTML features that still reproduce that mail archive-like list from your chats.

132
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,940
But the thing that really makes Zulip stand out is the way they speak to my brain.

133
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:28,880
They have built a chat collaboration system that allows for busy, silly discussions with

134
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:34,060
GIFs, lots of little silly posts that are taking up the chat, while still allowing people

135
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,280
from all different time zones to follow the important bits and allow management.

136
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,840
In fact, they even make a point here that really clicked with me.

137
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:48,040
They said, in practice, organizations that use Slack, many senior personnel don't read

138
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,400
the entire channel messages at all, or only read a handful of the smaller channels.

139
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,380
Is that not literally what happens with me and some of our channels sometimes when things

140
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,380
get busy?

141
00:08:58,380 --> 00:08:59,380
Yes.

142
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,380
I know.

143
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,320
And it's true for all of the leadership at Linux Academy.

144
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,700
It really is a problem to stay up to date with all the different Slack channels that

145
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,920
we have.

146
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,420
This is organized by topics, where you can have a channel, and then you have subtopics.

147
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,200
And it's designed to allow remote workers that are in different time zones to participate.

148
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,080
And make information more discoverable that is critical to a project or something you're

149
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,960
trying to actually execute and get done.

150
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
It's really clever.

151
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,620
And then you combine that with the fact that it's all open source and designed to publicly

152
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,520
archive all of the discussions to make it discoverable by the greater community.

153
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,080
Check, check, check for me.

154
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,800
I really think this is impressive.

155
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,520
Haven't run it yet, but Zula looks like it's a Slack killer to me for open source projects.

156
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,480
You know what jumped out at me from this release announcement, that there's a one click digital

157
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,240
ocean deployment.

158
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,560
Well that's speaking to a need here.

159
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,360
That's one of the things about Slack that makes it really easy to set up or maybe remote

160
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,600
hosted Mattermost as a service is it's one button deployment.

161
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,800
Well they got that with this and I think that's really important for a lot of projects.

162
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,400
They don't have a lot of people on a project, they just want to start collaborating and

163
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
get to work.

164
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,060
They don't want to spend a day standing up a server.

165
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,560
You know if time allows over the holiday, I might dig into the backstory of Zula because

166
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,240
it seems very feature complete and they're now releasing 2.1, which is really the main

167
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,880
headline this week.

168
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,260
I feel a little embarrassed that I didn't know about this and I may have been using

169
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,640
this had I known about it sooner.

170
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,520
And maybe I could find out the backstory and where they came from and how long they've

171
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,520
been doing this.

172
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,720
I'll dig into it over the holiday if time allows.

173
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,800
Well also over the holiday you could potentially host an instance on a Raspberry Pi.

174
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,960
On a Ubuntu of all things, this is really nice to see two things coming out of Canonical

175
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,520
this week regarding the Raspberry Pis.

176
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:55,720
Number one, USB ports are now functional on the 64-bit images for the Raspberry Pi 4,

177
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,360
which is something that bit me, very nice to see that.

178
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:05,080
But number two and perhaps bigger picture, the Raspberry Pi is now considered or maybe

179
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:11,040
has been considered but is officially publicly stated by Canonical a first class platform.

180
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,040
Yeah they say we're working with Raspberry Pi Foundation to have an officially supported

181
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,040
image of Ubuntu available at every new release of a Raspberry Pi board.

182
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
That's pretty big.

183
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,040
That's huge.

184
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,260
Because it's taken a while for the Raspberry Pi 4, but if they're going to get together

185
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,160
with them and whatever the next Pi is, there'll be day one support.

186
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
That's amazing.

187
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,280
Yeah, they don't say they have something sorted out with the Foundation, but they're working

188
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,580
towards it, which either means that Canonical will just brute force make it happen or if

189
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:44,480
best case scenario, they'll get a heads up from the Foundation and get some pre-production

190
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
boards.

191
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:50,840
Also very worth noting when you consider edge devices or development experimentation, they

192
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,400
plan to deliver Ubuntu Server 1804 and Ubuntu Core for the Raspberry Pi boards for all of

193
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:01,240
them and officially support it, which kind of plays into their overall Kubernetes cluster

194
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,400
strategy, but also their developer story.

195
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,300
Well, we talked about last week how ARM is getting more and more popular and having a

196
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,280
board there that you know is going to be supported by Ubuntu to build your applications on and

197
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,880
do your testing is going to make more and more people use Ubuntu, which is what Canonical

198
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,880
wants.

199
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,960
The other thing that I know some that are listening to this are screaming right now

200
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,920
is there's more powerful systems in the Raspberry Pi guys.

201
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,920
Don't you know?

202
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:34,280
Yes, we do know, but the Raspberry Pi has a very steady, predictable cadence and it

203
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:43,400
has the deepest ecosystem, both in third party images, community support, et cetera, and

204
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,440
it without a question has the largest brand awareness.

205
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,120
And it has the sheer numbers as well.

206
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:56,400
Eben Upton this week tweeted that they've sold 30 million Raspberry Pis and he also

207
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,160
said that that makes the revenue a billion dollars that they've taken in by selling these

208
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
things.

209
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,760
I mean, these are McDonald's hamburgers numbers at this point.

210
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,400
Not quite, but there's certainly numbers that you can't ignore.

211
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,160
It's not quite the kind of iPhone numbers or whatever, but can you imagine if they sold

212
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,560
30 million Pine phones or something, that would be quite the story, right?

213
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:27,160
And I think the unspoken truth here is none of us doubt that there will be a Raspberry

214
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:34,240
Pi 5 or several iterations of the four that might even go up to eight gigs of RAM or beyond.

215
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,440
That's just a foregone conclusion at this point.

216
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,440
And that kind of reliable cadence is the exact type of thing developers find comfort in.

217
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,160
It means I can prototype a product around this platform and I can kind of already foresee

218
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,760
where it's going without it even being written down.

219
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,440
That's the exact kind of thing that draws people to build things around something.

220
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,040
I think this is a very clever move on Canonical's part to say it so boldly, because I think

221
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,360
a lot of distributions have every intention of supporting future Raspberry Pis.

222
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,000
I bet a lot of them do, but by implicitly stating it, they are reassuring the developer

223
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,720
community that this is going to be a thing.

224
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,320
And that's the sort of psychological aspect to this market that I think Canonical and

225
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
the people behind Ubuntu really get.

226
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,860
Well, all that might well become irrelevant once Fuchsia takes over.

227
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,360
The operating system that seems to taunt Joe and I.

228
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,800
I don't know if it taunts anybody else out there, but we're always watching what's going

229
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,400
on with Fuchsia because it does seem like Google's skunk work project to replace Linux

230
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,400
one day.

231
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,080
The trickle-down effects of that, well, they get one to think.

232
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,000
However, it seems that the takeover is a slow and methodical approach if it is coming, and

233
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,480
it starts really with support for a new piece of hardware, one that you may be familiar

234
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
with.

235
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,920
It was discovered a while back that there was a Chrome OS tablet coming that had wireless

236
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,240
charging, and then later revealed that the code name was, I think it's Flapjack, Joe?

237
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Delicious Flapjack, yeah.

238
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,840
Yeah, and I guess it's going to run both Chrome OS and also will run Fuchsia.

239
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,280
Yeah, I don't think you're going to be able to buy it running Fuchsia, but I think it's

240
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,120
going to be a target for Fuchsia for developers, so they'll be able to buy this relatively

241
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,400
inexpensive tablet and then have a target device to do the development.

242
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,800
That seems to be the name of the game here, because if you look at the long strategy here,

243
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,920
Fuchsia OS has gained support for an actual decent amount of devices at this point, including

244
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,120
several smart home products like the Nest Hub and the Nest Hub Max, some smartphones

245
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,080
like the Honor Play, and people are getting it working on the Pixel 2, as well as the

246
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,520
new Pixelbook, and a couple of AMD Chromebooks can already run Fuchsia, and now this will

247
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,520
be added to that list, but like you said, it's expected to be kind of at a price range

248
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:57,520
more akin to the old Nexus devices approachable by developers.

249
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:02,480
It's just missing one critical piece, and that's apps.

250
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,840
Well, Google wants you to build those apps using Flutter, and that's had a release this

251
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,840
week.

252
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,380
Not just that, but it was Flutter Interact in New York City this week, a big Flutter

253
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:18,520
event where they announced their ambient computing initiative now includes Flutter for the web

254
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,140
and Flutter for the Mac.

255
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:27,640
I think the idea here is to get the developers ahead of the game using Flutter, using Dart,

256
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:32,040
which immediately translates to application compatibility with Fuchsia.

257
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,960
Yeah, this is very much Google playing the long game on this, and it seems like it could

258
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,640
be a pretty successful strategy to me.

259
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:44,200
There's a couple of examples of Flutter for the web applications that are now live, and

260
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,600
they're decent.

261
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,360
They're actually kind of decent web applications.

262
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,580
This is the very long game for Google to go about it this methodically where they're building

263
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:59,560
this operating system up from the ground, and then getting an ecosystem built by using

264
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,200
these third-party devices over a period of years.

265
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,240
If this eventually pops, it's going to be huge.

266
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,760
That's what kind of disturbs me about it.

267
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,160
I feel better about it if they were more traditional and they just released a half-baked product

268
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,000
that wasn't really all that great running on a Pixelbook knockoff that YouTubers would

269
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,200
say is horrible and everybody should buy an iPad instead, and then we'd just move on and

270
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,920
everybody would keep using Linux.

271
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,240
But instead, they're doing it the right way, and it kind of makes me wonder if this isn't

272
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,360
going to be a thing that we have to contend with, and I don't know what that means long

273
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
term.

274
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,660
The analogy I would make is with someone who wants to be an entertainer, right?

275
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:46,680
If you've got that backup career and you can just go for it slowly and build your other

276
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:53,200
career, your new entertainment career, being a rock star or actor or whatever, you don't

277
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,720
have that pressure on you that it has to be done right now.

278
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,200
They have got Chrome OS, they've got Android, and so there's no rush for this.

279
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,960
They can just slowly, slowly build it up until it's ready, and then suddenly Linux is just

280
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
crushed.

281
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,600
At least on the mobile market.

282
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,780
I would just hate it if we had to wipe that smug look off our face when we see people

283
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,680
pull out Android phones and we think to ourselves, Linux user, you don't even know it, but you're

284
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
running Linux.

285
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,880
I would hate to lose that.

286
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,200
That's a moment of pride in my day right now.

287
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,640
Well, I'm more worried about servers, to be honest, because there's no reason why you

288
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,760
can't adapt it in the same way that Linux you can use as a desktop operating system

289
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,520
or on the server or in containers and cloud, whatever.

290
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:38,080
There's not really any reason why long term, future can't do that.

291
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,740
That'll be the day.

292
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,480
Over my dead body, Joe.

293
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
That's not happening.

294
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,400
No way.

295
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,360
Linux from my lifetime has won the server.

296
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:55,280
I think that really is true because it's the platform that lets you run anything you want.

297
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:03,240
If you remember when mono was a thing, remember Java and wine and PHP, like all these different

298
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,380
crazy systems, they wouldn't be in some clean, nice vendor controlled platform.

299
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,260
Only Linux allows you to build the application and whatever the hell you need to get the

300
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,120
job done and then run it on a server and run it at scale.

301
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,040
And I just think that's too invaluable.

302
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:25,080
The processor architecture could change, but the fundamentals about a general purpose technology

303
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:30,000
platform that is freely available for anyone to take and then build their product around

304
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,920
with no major court, one singular corporation controlling it all, it's too good to pass

305
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,920
up.

306
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,800
So I think on the server we're safe.

307
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:43,040
However, mobile, maybe laptops, a little bit worried.

308
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Just a little bit.

309
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,800
Well, the way I see it, the underlying operating system is becoming less and less important.

310
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,240
And if you can make it more efficient in terms of power, electricity and everything, does

311
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,600
it really matter what's running underneath all the containers?

312
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,240
I know that is true.

313
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:06,600
I'll tell you my moment of panic will be when Microsoft releases office 365 apps for fuchsia.

314
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,480
When teams comes out for fuchsia, I'm freaking out.

315
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,720
Well, it probably won't be that long, but we'll see.

316
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,720
There's probably more chance of Twitter being decentralized than that though.

317
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,560
What do you think of this project blue story or whatever they're calling it, where they

318
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:29,160
claim they're going to set up a strike team of around five individuals or so within Twitter,

319
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:38,600
but also kind of their own organization potentially to develop or end up adopting a protocol based

320
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,840
decentralized platform for Twitter, where Twitter itself would become a client of that

321
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,320
said new decentralized platform?

322
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,260
I'm very skeptical to calling it project blue sky.

323
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,800
That's what it is.

324
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,880
It's funded by Twitter, but it's going to be an external entity somehow.

325
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,600
It seems like if you're really going to do something like that, five people, that's not

326
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,080
really enough, is it?

327
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:07,420
Well, I mean, it could be if you adopt an existing standard like activity pub and throw

328
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,320
millions of dollars at it and three or four developers, that could work.

329
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,600
If you're going to roll your own solution and invent your own new protocol and standard,

330
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
I don't think so.

331
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,740
You'd have to grow it pretty rapidly.

332
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:27,340
This whole thing, Joe, is really strange because this was more like how Twitter started.

333
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:35,600
They made changes back in 2012 that begun the process of locking this down and centralizing

334
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
it.

335
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,680
I don't know if you recall, but there's a great Verge piece we'll have linked in the

336
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,920
show notes, and they write on here, death came to the Twitter developer community on

337
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,840
August 12, 2012.

338
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,720
In an infamous memo, the company's head of product divided potential uses of the Twitter

339
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,000
API into four quadrants.

340
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,320
I think we all remember, if you're a Twitter user at least, when that happened.

341
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,760
That policy led Twitter to become really a centralized platform that was designed to

342
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:07,200
sell advertising.

343
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,320
Interestingly enough, at the time, the CEO of Twitter was a former Googler who was hell

344
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,200
bent on building an ad platform.

345
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,320
Kind of funny how that works.

346
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,200
Now Jack Dorsey takes over.

347
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,720
He has been a little more resistant to censorship or shutting things down to some degree.

348
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:30,000
He can argue it, but it seems like maybe he really does see Twitter as a possible SMTP

349
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,800
of the future.

350
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,080
Maybe if you're to take him at his word, he really wants to decentralize this thing so

351
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,220
that way you can have some versions of Twitter that are tightly controlled with speech and

352
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,240
others that are sort of a Wild West.

353
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,300
That's just wishful thinking, I think, Joe.

354
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,960
Did you listen to the two podcasts he did with Rogan?

355
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
Bits of it.

356
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,480
I really, I just don't care enough about Twitter to go any further.

357
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,880
I ask because what came across to me on those two podcasts is that he sees himself as a

358
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,760
visionary, Jack Dorsey.

359
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:09,680
He feels that Twitter is nowhere near complete in terms of what it's going to become.

360
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,880
I'm not hugely surprised that he's got this grand vision for it, but it just seems like

361
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:22,200
we have decentralized social media already with Mastodon and we had Diaspora.

362
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,200
They are relatively popular, but they are just dwarfed by the size of Twitter.

363
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:34,440
It's very, very difficult to make a decentralized system popular.

364
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,120
The whole point of Twitter is everyone's there and yeah, okay, if it's federated across loads

365
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,540
of different servers, everyone will be on one of them somehow, but until someone makes

366
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:50,240
it as simple as signing up for Twitter and then it's just at your name to talk to other

367
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,440
people and follow them.

368
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,440
I don't think that decentralized social media is going to go anywhere, but I don't know.

369
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,320
He is this real visionary, at least in his own head he is.

370
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:05,280
Maybe he is going to be the person to do this, but I'm just very skeptical.

371
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,600
I got a vision.

372
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:13,600
How about a social communications platform where anyone could host their own server or

373
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,340
there could be large centralized servers depending on your preferred flavor and then there'd

374
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,840
be a bunch of third-party clients that could match your particular style and you could

375
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:28,040
connect multiple servers from one client and then on these servers, you could have individual

376
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,040
rooms dedicated to topics for individual particular areas of interest.

377
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,600
What do you think of that?

378
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,680
It could be on any server or it could be on centralized servers, whichever you prefer.

379
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,160
Would all of the rooms have to start with a pound sign?

380
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
Yes.

381
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Yes.

382
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Yes.

383
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,880
I'm talking about IRC, obviously.

384
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:54,200
Yeah, this is somewhat reinventing the wheel, I suppose, but it would be interesting if

385
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,400
Twitter was just one client that connected to the network.

386
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,120
I have seen people saying that it is just Jack Dorsey trying to get out of this moderation

387
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,880
problem that they have and trying to wash his hands of the responsibility for moderating

388
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,880
the platform.

389
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
I could see that.

390
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:16,360
However, I think that's shortchanging the importance of the topic of communication.

391
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,320
Look at just our episode, Microsoft Teams for Linux, which is a direct competitor to

392
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,800
Slack, which has completely changed the way companies communicate and a lot of projects

393
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
communicate.

394
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,840
Then we talked about an open source competitor, Zulip, that's offering things that solve problems

395
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:38,000
like time zone differences and busy, goofy, different discussion groups and public posting

396
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,740
and review.

397
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:44,600
Now here we are discussing Twitter, which has become sort of a centralized communication

398
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,880
platform of signals that some people think should be broken up.

399
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,280
I think the underlying theme of all of it is how we communicate online and the bandwidth

400
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,360
of that communication, the richness of that communication is becoming more important than

401
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,360
ever.

402
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:07,840
While I make jokes about IRC, I think it is clear that IRC was not high enough bandwidth.

403
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:15,240
It was not rich enough in information in detail and that there is a strong desire for a better

404
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,680
way to communicate.

405
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,400
And then there are a bunch of players like Slack, like Microsoft and others like Twitter

406
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:27,200
and Facebook and et cetera, that want to be the resource that everybody goes to to solve

407
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,200
this problem.

408
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,760
I mean, it's clear this is a massive theme of this year, just looking at it right here

409
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
in just this one episode.

410
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,880
Well, who knows what's going to happen, but there's a quote at the end of that Verge article

411
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,520
that you mentioned from a former employee of Twitter and they say, well, it's Twitter,

412
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,720
so nothing's going to happen for 20 years.

413
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,320
And in the meantime, things will just keep moving forward.

414
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,160
On Linux, gaming may have a bit of a bumpy road in the near future.

415
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:02,000
One of the key developers, the main developer behind DXVK has recently expressed some frustrations

416
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,600
and some plans to transition the project into maintenance mode, even if it's not necessarily

417
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,760
feature complete yet.

418
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:15,640
Yeah, Philip says that DXVK has become a fragile, unreliable and frustrating maintenance nightmare.

419
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,240
That doesn't sound good, does it?

420
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
No.

421
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,280
And this is kind of an important gaming technology for those of us who enjoy a game or two on

422
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,280
Linux.

423
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:29,040
As a reminder, DXVK is that Vulkan based translation layer for Direct3D 10 or 11, which allows

424
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:35,520
those applications to translate to Vulkan calls, which makes them run on Linux.

425
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,720
It's not going away, so it'll still exist.

426
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,680
But he says, I'm going to add a few more features and then I think I'm done.

427
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,520
Now the communities are trying to come up with ways they could support him because this

428
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,120
type of expertise is very unique.

429
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,160
It's not like there's 100 other developers with free time on their hands that could pick

430
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,760
up this particular kind of heavy hitting work.

431
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,880
Yeah, and combine that with Feral's lead Vulkan developer leaving the company to go to Sony

432
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,080
and it's kind of a double whammy.

433
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,080
Indeed.

434
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,440
These individuals are highly coveted.

435
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,680
They are extremely skilled.

436
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:14,360
This is a very specialized area of work and Alex Smith, who oversaw Feral's Vulkan support,

437
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,880
was key in seeing that company move to Vulkan, which opened up a whole new window of opportunity

438
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,480
for Linux games.

439
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,320
He also did work in the past on some Nintendo Switch ports for Feral, as well as some of

440
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,660
the Linux ports.

441
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:32,020
So while it's a loss for Feral, they had responded on Twitter saying that they do have more games

442
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:36,660
planned for 2020 and they do have a fully functional Direct3D to Vulkan layer in place

443
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,240
that so far is working for them.

444
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:44,040
But when these two stories are combined, it does sort of feel like one of those couple

445
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,600
of steps forward recently, but now we've taken maybe a half step back.

446
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,800
We've lost a little momentum.

447
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,960
Yeah, just when things were seemingly going so well with gaming on Linux, it's a shame

448
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,960
really.

449
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,160
So there was kind of a glimmer of hope for gaming on Linux and that is that Nvidia may

450
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,000
possibly open source some drivers next year.

451
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yeah.

452
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,460
Michael Larable coming in with a hot fresh rumor that's almost guaranteed to be a fact

453
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,460
doomer.

454
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,680
I'm not sure what you call that.

455
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,820
But he says start looking forward to March when Nvidia looks to have some sort of open

456
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:20,360
source driver initiative to announce, likely contributing more to Novu.

457
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:26,960
This is based on a tip that he got on a GTC session, which is Nvidia's event that's happening

458
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
in March.

459
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,360
And they have a session titled open source Linux kernel and Nvidia.

460
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,440
And the abstract of the talk is we'll report up to minute developments on Nvidia status

461
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,120
and activities and possibly a few future plans and directions regarding our contributions

462
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,320
to the Linux kernel supporting Novu, the open source kernel driver for Nvidia GPUs that's

463
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:57,920
in the Linux kernel and including sign firmware behavior, documentation and patches and Nvidia's

464
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,720
kernel drivers and quote.

465
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:08,020
If they even like do half of that stuff in March or announce a plan throughout 2020 to

466
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:16,440
roll that out, that would be a huge enabler for not just gaming on Linux, but workstation

467
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,560
using graphic loads like CUDA and others on Linux.

468
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,840
I mean, just massively huge for people that have spent good money on hardware in their

469
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
computer.

470
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,840
If you told me that they were going to do this a year or so ago, I would have not believed

471
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,080
you or said there was more chance of you pronouncing Novu correctly.

472
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
Right.

473
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
Absolutely.

474
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,960
Which, let's face it, very small chance of that happening.

475
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,400
But this does look promising.

476
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
It sure does.

477
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,060
If it was just a rumor without that abstract, I'd be like, well, that could mean anything.

478
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,640
That could just be a talk on how great Nvidia is.

479
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,880
But when you combine it with the abstract description, that's where it really makes

480
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,480
you think something's about to shift.

481
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,720
And perhaps it should.

482
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,480
I have to say, I've really enjoyed the AMD graphics cards I've bought this year.

483
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,800
I've popped them in my systems.

484
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:08,360
And no fuss, I have fantastic 3D support for games, desktop effects, anything I want.

485
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,720
And I never had to even check a box.

486
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,340
Well, fingers crossed they are going to compete with it.

487
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,960
And we will definitely follow that progress as it goes throughout next year.

488
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,960
I know it's big for you.

489
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,800
You know, you're a big GPU buyer, so.

490
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
What GPU do you have?

491
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
I don't.

492
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:30,000
I've got this huge case with no GPU or hard drives or anything in it.

493
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,400
Now I know what to get you for Christmas.

494
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:36,160
