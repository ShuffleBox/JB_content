Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

00:04.920 --> 00:09.080
Episode 211, recorded on October 17th, 2021.

00:09.080 --> 00:10.080
I'm Chris.

00:10.080 --> 00:11.080
And I'm Wes.

00:11.080 --> 00:12.080
Hello, Wes.

00:12.080 --> 00:13.080
Let's do the news.

00:13.080 --> 00:19.200
With the release of Plasma 5.23 this week, the KDE community is celebrating its 25th

00:19.200 --> 00:20.200
birthday.

00:20.200 --> 00:29.000
On October 14th, 1996, Matthias Ettrick announced a new project, the Cool Desktop Environment.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.160
KDE was launched with a goal, a bold goal to make a desktop for end users and maybe

00:35.160 --> 00:37.760
even standardize the Linux desktop somewhat.

00:37.760 --> 00:43.440
So picture it, it was a long time ago back in 96 when KDE launched, a Linux user at the

00:43.440 --> 00:47.800
time would need to cobble together maybe a dozen different toolkits and widget sets to

00:47.800 --> 00:52.480
get all of the various desktop applications, quote unquote applications they needed back

00:52.480 --> 00:53.720
in the day.

00:53.720 --> 00:58.000
We kind of take it for granted now, because in many ways, they've been successful.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.500
We essentially have a predominantly GTK and Qt app ecosystem on the Linux desktop.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.120
That's a lot better than a dozen.

01:06.120 --> 01:11.680
And now 25 years later, KDE Plasma 5.23 looks like something of a special release.

01:11.680 --> 01:17.960
As with every recent release, 5.23 sees much improved Wayland support and gesture support

01:17.960 --> 01:23.240
and improved compatibility between Wayland and ExWayland applications.

01:23.240 --> 01:28.200
And Chris, I know you'll be happy to see this land multiscreen layouts are now retained

01:28.200 --> 01:31.720
across X11 and Wayland sessions.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.960
I'm allowed to do a happy dance over this one, right, Wes?

01:33.960 --> 01:36.600
I think so.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.600
This is amazing.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.680
I'm doing a happy dance right now, if you can't tell.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.680
I mean, I legitimately had just written this off as a thing.

01:43.680 --> 01:48.640
I figured one of the costs as an end user that was living on the Linux desktop through

01:48.640 --> 01:53.920
the X11 to Wayland transition was that I just wouldn't have ideally preserved window arrangement

01:53.920 --> 01:56.080
layout saved when I switched display servers.

01:56.080 --> 02:00.080
I just I'd come to accept that it was a fact of Linux desktop life.

02:00.080 --> 02:03.880
And somehow these crazy Plasma devs have actually solved that problem.

02:03.880 --> 02:07.520
In my opinion, that's so huge because it's just a feature I never thought we were going

02:07.520 --> 02:08.520
to see.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.080
And they delivered it in this edition.

02:10.080 --> 02:14.080
I also know that they just put a gigantic amount of effort into things like the kickoff

02:14.080 --> 02:19.000
application launcher and into their application installer, KDE Discover.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.880
It's great to see those applications get some work.

02:21.880 --> 02:22.880
Indeed.

02:22.880 --> 02:28.600
And all that is, of course, among a wide variety of other improvements and fixes throughout

02:28.600 --> 02:29.600
Plasma.

02:29.600 --> 02:32.240
This is a version of Plasma you could move into for a while.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.240
Oh, definitely.

02:33.240 --> 02:37.600
You know, I've gotten a little bit of hands on this weekend with the new release.

02:37.600 --> 02:40.520
So this is just early impressions from me.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.320
And I generally they evolve over time and whatnot.

02:43.320 --> 02:47.880
But you know, the one thing that's an obvious trend here is that Plasma has been in a real

02:47.880 --> 02:50.920
refinement period for for a little bit now.

02:50.920 --> 02:57.320
And every release has noticeably and quantifiably improved the user experience in sometimes

02:57.320 --> 03:00.080
small ways and in sometimes large ways.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.440
And it's been on that trajectory now for a while.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.920
Plasma 5.23 doubles down on that trajectory.

03:06.920 --> 03:11.620
And on that front, I have to say the new blue ocean breeze theme has brought me back to

03:11.620 --> 03:13.840
using a light theme on Plasma.

03:13.840 --> 03:18.720
It just does a better job of drawing my eyes to the active elements in the window.

03:18.720 --> 03:23.280
And it honestly just has a really professional finished feel to it.

03:23.280 --> 03:26.800
And I like the new ability to easily tweak the accent colors.

03:26.800 --> 03:30.460
You kind of do this in Plasma before, but they've made it way easier now.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.080
And those kickoff improvements I mentioned, well, they're welcomed by me.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.880
I mean, it's it was needed.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.280
I think it needed some TLC.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.240
Those improvements were necessary.

03:38.240 --> 03:40.280
And they've just knocked him out of the park.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.840
They've done a great job.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.880
For those of you not familiar, the kickoff menu is like the start menu, if you will,

03:45.880 --> 03:46.880
for the Plasma desktop.

03:46.880 --> 03:49.160
And so you want that to be well refined.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.360
You want it to look really solid.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.920
It's one of the very first things a new user interacts with.

03:53.920 --> 03:57.600
And it's one of the things a longtime user will use thousands of times.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.640
So these improvements matter a lot.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.140
And they nailed it with this release.

04:01.140 --> 04:02.180
It just looks better.

04:02.180 --> 04:03.320
It works better.

04:03.320 --> 04:08.280
And I'd expect Microsoft to rip this off for Windows 12.

04:08.280 --> 04:13.720
The Blender project announced Apple has joined their development fund, apparently in the

04:13.720 --> 04:14.720
works for some time.

04:14.720 --> 04:17.400
But this week, the project made the investment public.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.400
Yeah.

04:18.400 --> 04:22.480
And along with the news about money, there was also some news about code.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.760
The first official patch to Blender was submitted by Apple.

04:25.760 --> 04:31.800
And surprise, surprise, it's a metal back end for GPU rendering on Mac OS.

04:31.800 --> 04:36.080
But according to the announcement, Apple will also provide ongoing engineering expertise

04:36.080 --> 04:40.200
and additional resources to Blender and its broader development community as well.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.760
Yeah, this kind of investment seems to be a win win for everyone.

04:43.760 --> 04:47.400
I mean, an important project gets critical funding.

04:47.400 --> 04:52.440
And Apple gets support for Mac OS and gives developers incentive to keep that support

04:52.440 --> 04:54.240
first rate.

04:54.240 --> 04:58.760
Blender said its development fund accepts donations to quote, support activities to

04:58.760 --> 05:04.080
provide free and open accessible services for all Blender contributors, including bug

05:04.080 --> 05:08.520
fixing, code reviews, technical documentation, and onboarding.

05:08.520 --> 05:11.600
This seems like big news for you Mac OS users out there.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.760
More doors are going to open.

05:12.760 --> 05:17.480
This will have broader impacts than just Blender for free software that supports GPU rendering

05:17.480 --> 05:19.080
on Apple's SoC.

05:19.080 --> 05:24.160
And let's not forget with Blender seeing more comprehensive and broader adoption, all three

05:24.160 --> 05:31.040
major desktop platforms will have a compatible open source 3D graphics tool.

05:31.040 --> 05:35.160
Igor Tseletsky, the CEO of Cloud Linux and the founder of Alma Linux has announced he

05:35.160 --> 05:38.960
is stepping down from the Alma Linux OS foundation board.

05:38.960 --> 05:44.400
2021 has been something of a bootstrapping year for the new CentOS alternatives that

05:44.400 --> 05:45.400
have popped up.

05:45.400 --> 05:50.840
Alma Linux was spun out from Cloud Linux shortly after the CentOS stream transition announcement

05:50.840 --> 05:53.460
back in December of 2020.

05:53.460 --> 05:58.080
We asked Igor if it was his intention from the start to step down eventually, or if this

05:58.080 --> 06:00.420
was in response to some event.

06:00.420 --> 06:05.880
He told us, quote, the intention from the start was to make it a well-governed and independent

06:05.880 --> 06:09.520
organization that will survive the test of time.

06:09.520 --> 06:14.680
Knowing the history of CentOS, which never had any org structure behind it, I knew the

06:14.680 --> 06:16.440
governance will be very important.

06:16.440 --> 06:21.920
I didn't know which form it will take, but it was always the goal.

06:21.920 --> 06:26.480
Igor went on to say that there was no intention for him to be on the board in the first place.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.760
In fact, he says, quote, it was more of a necessity.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.040
Someone had to do it.

06:31.040 --> 06:34.680
Someone had to drive the process forward, invite people, talk to lawyers, figure out

06:34.680 --> 06:35.800
the next steps.

06:35.800 --> 06:41.760
He finishes by saying, you would be surprised just how few people want that responsibility.

06:41.760 --> 06:47.280
At the end of March, the Alma Linux Foundation was formed to manage the trademarks and, in

06:47.280 --> 06:54.280
the words of its bylaws, to, quote, develop and maintain a no-registration, ad-free, stable,

06:54.280 --> 06:57.480
open-source Linux distribution.

06:57.480 --> 07:03.120
Igor told us, quote, I don't have a sentiment that Alma Linux is mine.

07:03.120 --> 07:04.600
It is not.

07:04.600 --> 07:08.200
I helped to start it, and I will continue helping it flourish.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.120
Yet I will not be done giving it direction.

07:11.120 --> 07:14.280
That is the whole point of it being a community-owned organization.

07:14.280 --> 07:19.880
It should be the community that decides what is next, what is OK, and what is acceptable.

07:19.880 --> 07:24.600
Here, here, I think to really appreciate how big of a deal this is, especially if you're

07:24.600 --> 07:32.200
not a CentOS user, you have to consider how critical the server market is to Linux and

07:32.200 --> 07:38.600
how important it is to have a free, enterprise-grade, community-run distribution that actually has

07:38.600 --> 07:40.500
broad vendor support.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.560
It's absolutely vital.

07:41.560 --> 07:44.920
I think it's a key part of the Linux server ecosystem.

07:44.920 --> 07:51.120
But it's not just that context, which is already super important, but it's also an important

07:51.120 --> 07:54.640
historical milestone for long-term CentOS users.

07:54.640 --> 08:00.700
Because at the core of the issues that plagued CentOS in the past, like the pre-Red Hat days,

08:00.700 --> 08:05.920
it was always the knock-on effects of its original ownership structure, if we'll just

08:05.920 --> 08:12.480
call it that loosely, and the problems that resulted in losing one of its original founders

08:12.480 --> 08:17.260
who had access to the PayPal account, who had access to the website, had trademarks.

08:17.260 --> 08:19.240
It just plagued the project.

08:19.240 --> 08:25.080
Yeah, and I think that's the lens with which we should be observing this news.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.840
Stepping down from a board like this is a notable move on its own.

08:28.840 --> 08:33.840
But for the CentOS community, this is significant.

08:33.840 --> 08:37.920
And it's sort of a signal that business continues as normal.

08:37.920 --> 08:43.760
Alma Linux shipped their 8.5 beta shortly after this news dropped, and just six days

08:43.760 --> 08:48.300
after Red Hat Enterprise 8.5's beta shipped.

08:48.300 --> 08:53.880
That's been a trend, and it's something CentOS users notice.

08:53.880 --> 08:54.880
Linode.com slash LAN.

08:54.880 --> 08:59.280
You go there to get $100 in 6-day credit on a new account, and you go there to support

08:59.280 --> 09:00.880
this here show.

09:00.880 --> 09:04.720
Linode is where we host the services that you use whenever you're downloading a podcast

09:04.720 --> 09:07.680
or interacting with us on a regular basis.

09:07.680 --> 09:12.360
And one of our secret sauces has really been their object storage.

09:12.360 --> 09:15.680
I normally would sit here and tell you about how fast their machines are, and how they

09:15.680 --> 09:21.480
have 11 data centers, and NVMe upgraded disks in their systems, and AMD EPYC processors

09:21.480 --> 09:23.160
for their high-end CPU boxes.

09:23.160 --> 09:27.440
But honestly, I'm finding new uses for object storage all the time.

09:27.440 --> 09:32.960
And in the show notes, I'll put a link to a guide that Linode has released to use Plex

09:32.960 --> 09:34.240
with object storage.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.360
You see where I'm going with that?

09:37.360 --> 09:39.040
That could be fire right there.

09:39.040 --> 09:42.560
And when you go to Linode.com slash LAN, you get $100 to work with here.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.640
So you can really try them out.

09:43.640 --> 09:47.840
You can go build a system, go deploy your own Jitsi box or something like that, and

09:47.840 --> 09:52.240
really get a sense of how fast the boxes are and how clean the dashboard is.

09:52.240 --> 09:56.040
And then if you ever need help, they've got the best customer support in the business.

09:56.040 --> 10:00.700
People that are really going to help you 24-7 by phone, by ticket, or by social.

10:00.700 --> 10:04.640
And they're often advancing into new areas as well, like bare metal servers is something

10:04.640 --> 10:09.160
they're rolling out, DDoS protection, cloud firewalls, these kinds of things that are

10:09.160 --> 10:13.000
just super nice to have and make working with Linode even faster.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.480
I really appreciate they have image templates, they have stack scripts, and their one click

10:16.480 --> 10:19.880
deployments make it super easy to get started with like a base system that you can build

10:19.880 --> 10:22.200
on top of really quick.

10:22.200 --> 10:25.560
But let's be honest, one of the best things is their pricing.

10:25.560 --> 10:29.440
They're 30 to 50% cheaper than other major cloud providers.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.440
That's pretty nice.

10:30.440 --> 10:33.920
When you look at the performance, the price, and the fact that you get to support your

10:33.920 --> 10:37.960
local friendly Linux action news, that's a pretty nice combination.

10:37.960 --> 10:41.320
And then if you get into more advanced stuff, like you need Terraform or Kubernetes support,

10:41.320 --> 10:43.080
well, they got that too.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.080
They got Kubernetes for days.

10:44.080 --> 10:48.240
I mean, Wes is always going on about the Kubernetes, the Kubernetes, and Linode's got that.

10:48.240 --> 10:53.000
Go check it out for yourself though, and take advantage of that $100 and support the show.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.360
Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.200
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.900
So sign up today, linode.com slash LAN.

11:01.900 --> 11:15.160
Linux.ting.com.

11:15.160 --> 11:18.360
Boy am I grateful for mobile connectivity today.

11:18.360 --> 11:19.360
What a day it is.

11:19.360 --> 11:23.520
I'm sure you've had these too, where you've got work stuff and you got parent stuff.

11:23.520 --> 11:27.560
Mobile connectivity is essential, and I am very grateful for Ting's flexibility.

11:27.560 --> 11:32.700
You know, I've been a customer since 2013, and the reality is they've been flexible with

11:32.700 --> 11:34.480
me the entire time.

11:34.480 --> 11:35.480
Here I am today.

11:35.480 --> 11:40.020
I'm more of a heavy user on data than I ever was, but in the past I fancied myself as someone

11:40.020 --> 11:47.200
who was able to download my podcasts and sync my photos and get things prepared before I

11:47.200 --> 11:48.200
left.

11:48.200 --> 11:52.560
But these days I'm flying by the seat of my pants more and more, and Ting stayed flexible.

11:52.560 --> 11:53.880
Their plans are simple and straightforward.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.880
You just go to their website, you see them, they're easy.

11:55.880 --> 11:59.320
Go to linux.ting.com though, because that'll take 25 bucks off.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.560
You see, the name of the game here is that Ting's an MBNO.

12:02.560 --> 12:06.600
That means that they get to focus on things like customer service and being competitive

12:06.600 --> 12:10.200
in the marketplace, and they don't have to focus on digging holes in the ground like

12:10.200 --> 12:13.360
the duopolies do, but they get to ride on top of their networks.

12:13.360 --> 12:17.920
It's a pretty slick setup and it gives Ting the flexibility to do things like no contracts

12:17.920 --> 12:21.360
and just fantastic pricing and the best customer support in the business.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.000
So go to linux.ting.com to get started.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.080
Fill in your information, Ting will give you a SIM card, they'll ship it to you, they'll

12:27.080 --> 12:29.280
mail it to you, you know, that kind of thing.

12:29.280 --> 12:32.520
You pop it in your phone and you get off and going in seconds because they've got a great

12:32.520 --> 12:33.520
dashboard.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.280
And if you ever need any help, they've got great customer support.

12:36.280 --> 12:38.740
Join me on Ting, linux.ting.com.

12:38.740 --> 12:42.480
Now I've got to get out of here.

12:42.480 --> 12:50.040
On Thursday, October 14th, we saw the release of Ubuntu 21.10, an LTS interim release with

12:50.040 --> 12:55.640
nine months of support and the first to use GNOME 40 for the desktop.

12:55.640 --> 13:01.440
Chronicles release announcement focuses on developers and specifically Windows developers

13:01.440 --> 13:06.600
saying quote, Windows developers will be delighted with out of the box support for graphical

13:06.600 --> 13:11.840
applications on Windows subsystem for Linux, which enables users to enjoy Ubuntu desktop

13:11.840 --> 13:14.940
applications without modification.

13:14.940 --> 13:20.360
That does give you some indication of the focus of this release, it's developers.

13:20.360 --> 13:23.800
Those of us who've been around for a while and have seen some of these releases, we know

13:23.800 --> 13:24.800
how this works.

13:24.800 --> 13:29.480
The LTS release gets many magnitudes more of users and likely the press coverage too

13:29.480 --> 13:31.240
than these interim releases do.

13:31.240 --> 13:34.800
But this is the land where Canonical traditionally plays.

13:34.800 --> 13:37.800
It does interesting work, if not even risky work.

13:37.800 --> 13:38.800
Right.

13:38.800 --> 13:43.780
You might recall it was way back in the Ubuntu 17.10 release cycle that Canonical tried switching

13:43.780 --> 13:49.920
to Wayland by default before ultimately determining, no, that was too early, Wayland isn't ready

13:49.920 --> 13:52.780
and walk that back in 1804.

13:52.780 --> 13:56.940
That's a great example of where they use that interim release to really experiment.

13:56.940 --> 14:02.260
And in comparison, I'm pretty underwhelmed with the release of Ubuntu 21.10.

14:02.260 --> 14:04.760
And to be clear, this is why we save this for the end of the show this week.

14:04.760 --> 14:07.500
This is really more of an opinion piece than it is news.

14:07.500 --> 14:12.840
But having reviewed every release of Ubuntu ever personally, I'm left feeling like Canonical

14:12.840 --> 14:17.120
has sort of stopped experimenting with these and the last release as well.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.760
There's nothing that we're really trying here.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.600
I mean, there's nothing incredibly new.

14:21.600 --> 14:25.680
As things stand right now, I basically kind of have to look forward to the LTS for something

14:25.680 --> 14:27.400
new.

14:27.400 --> 14:31.720
And well, that's likely going to leave me disappointed, especially with Ubuntu now falling

14:31.720 --> 14:35.640
behind on both GNOME and GTK.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.240
They only just now started shipping pipeline.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.120
It's not being used by default.

14:41.120 --> 14:45.200
And it's unclear if they'll make the leap to GNOME 42 for their LTS, which will land

14:45.200 --> 14:48.600
late in the 2204 cycle.

14:48.600 --> 14:56.120
As for the kernel, Linux 5.13, it's definitely solid, but 5.14 has been out for a bit now.

14:56.120 --> 15:01.440
And we're really starting to see some major important things land in these recent kernels.

15:01.440 --> 15:04.240
Staying current right now seems to matter more than ever.

15:04.240 --> 15:09.240
Which is why it's kind of a bit ironic that Canonical is positioning this release as one

15:09.240 --> 15:11.160
for developers.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.880
My thoughts as well.

15:12.880 --> 15:16.160
It is great to see first class WSL support.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.720
And I think it's a very clever move on Canonical's part.

15:19.720 --> 15:24.480
And it seems like an investment they're making today that will have future returns.

15:24.480 --> 15:31.160
But outside of WSL, what is the specific special sauce Ubuntu is offering developers right

15:31.160 --> 15:32.160
now?

15:32.160 --> 15:34.440
Is it their out of date GTK environment?

15:34.440 --> 15:36.080
Their not so current kernel?

15:36.080 --> 15:40.200
And what's the value for developers who are running the bulk of their applications in

15:40.200 --> 15:41.400
containers?

15:41.400 --> 15:45.800
It's getting harder and harder to answer that question these days.

15:45.800 --> 15:51.840
And when I zoom out, and I look at the longer term trends around Ubuntu as a platform, it

15:51.840 --> 15:55.080
seems like it might be coming less appealing to build on.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.600
And let's take a look at the deck.

15:58.600 --> 16:03.380
You kind of have to wonder, why didn't Valve go with Ubuntu on the deck?

16:03.380 --> 16:07.760
After all, the compatibility environment they ship with Steam is, and always has been, I

16:07.760 --> 16:10.720
should say, based on Ubuntu.

16:10.720 --> 16:14.640
So wouldn't have just been more straightforward to expand upon that?

16:14.640 --> 16:19.680
You got to imagine from a tooling and workflow standpoint, it would have been easier for

16:19.680 --> 16:23.900
the development team just to build on that and make the entire device Ubuntu.

16:23.900 --> 16:28.880
But instead, they rebased on Arch, which is no small effort.

16:28.880 --> 16:34.320
Yeah, I mean, Valve's SteamOS developers had to make a choice here with Arch.

16:34.320 --> 16:41.040
And one that they would know might mean having to retool and rethink how to build a distro.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.380
Something had to motivate a change like that.

16:43.380 --> 16:47.620
You have to wonder what was the missing pieces that made Ubuntu not a contender.

16:47.620 --> 16:51.400
And it's likely fresher components and drivers and software.

16:51.400 --> 16:55.440
And Valve's not the only developer in town that has those requirements.

16:55.440 --> 16:59.240
They're left sort of just feeling like Ubuntu has taken their eye off this project a little

16:59.240 --> 17:02.720
bit, like it's still got good staff from Canonical working on it.

17:02.720 --> 17:07.320
But that top-down driver that's generally needed at Canonical, it's hard to say, but

17:07.320 --> 17:09.480
it feels like it's missing these days.

17:09.480 --> 17:13.200
And maybe it just doesn't have the same level of investment at the corporate level, especially

17:13.200 --> 17:15.680
at the top level of the corporation that it used to.

17:15.680 --> 17:19.820
Of course, Canonical will never come out and release a press release that says, we're not

17:19.820 --> 17:22.120
quite as interested in the desktop anymore, right?

17:22.120 --> 17:26.640
They're going to continue to make a product that their OEMs can use, but they're not going

17:26.640 --> 17:31.640
to necessarily advertise that it's a minimum viable effort from a company standpoint.

17:31.640 --> 17:36.780
But that's not to say we are not grateful to the developers who do hard work on the

17:36.780 --> 17:40.400
Ubuntu desktop and make it what it is.

17:40.400 --> 17:44.600
We are very thankful for everything you do.

17:44.600 --> 17:50.040
And while these last two rounds of releases have been somewhat underwhelming, the LTS

17:50.040 --> 17:52.100
is really the final game.

17:52.100 --> 17:53.200
That's true.

17:53.200 --> 17:55.320
And the flavors also have a lot to offer.

17:55.320 --> 17:59.140
For our complete review and thoughts on those flavors and our other notes, go check out

17:59.140 --> 18:03.220

And just a programming note for next week, the episode will be out just a little bit

18:06.720 --> 18:08.320
later than usual.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.960
Wes is off to a wedding, not his own, but he's attending a friend's wedding over the

18:11.960 --> 18:12.960
weekend.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.160
