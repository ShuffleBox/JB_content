Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

00:05.320 --> 00:09.520
Episode 115, recorded on July 21st, 2019.

00:09.520 --> 00:10.520
I'm Chris.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.520
And I'm Joe.

00:11.520 --> 00:12.520
Hello, Joe.

00:12.520 --> 00:13.880
Good to be connected with you.

00:13.880 --> 00:18.320
And I always like starting the show out with a new Linux release.

00:18.320 --> 00:24.760
And this week, we're taking a look at EndeavorOS, their first stable release, which Joe, I'm

00:24.760 --> 00:27.020
sure it might just where EndeavorOS comes from.

00:27.020 --> 00:28.920
It's been a couple of days.

00:28.920 --> 00:32.720
Well, how long ago was it that Antigos decided that they were packing it in?

00:32.720 --> 00:34.160
That must be about a month ago, right?

00:34.160 --> 00:36.460
I want to almost say two months as we record now.

00:36.460 --> 00:37.760
It's just right around there.

00:37.760 --> 00:38.760
Yeah.

00:38.760 --> 00:43.680
Well, around the time of the announcement that they were going to stop doing Antigos,

00:43.680 --> 00:47.280
a few people from the community decided that they wanted to continue it.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.640
It was decided that they wouldn't call it Antigos anymore, that they'd give it a new

00:51.640 --> 00:52.640
name.

00:52.640 --> 00:53.640
And so EndeavorOS was born.

00:53.640 --> 00:59.120
Now, I was very skeptical, very skeptical that it was actually going to happen.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.160
But it has happened.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.280
And now we've got the first stable release of it.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.480
And having checked it out, I'm quite impressed.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.080
Yeah, me too.

01:08.080 --> 01:11.000
I'm delighted to say I'm very impressed.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.520
And I think you'll recall I was a little worried that it may have been derivative, that maybe

01:15.520 --> 01:19.440
it was time to just let Antigos go.

01:19.440 --> 01:22.080
And they had made a thing and let it pass.

01:22.080 --> 01:25.720
But EndeavorOS is truly its own thing.

01:25.720 --> 01:31.560
It really was not what I expected, starting from the installer being a little bit different

01:31.560 --> 01:36.960
and the desktop environment that is chosen by default being completely different.

01:36.960 --> 01:41.880
And one of the more interesting implementations of Joe's favorite XFCE.

01:41.880 --> 01:46.120
Yeah, I was very pleasantly surprised because it used GNOME before, didn't it?

01:46.120 --> 01:48.920
Whereas now they've switched to XFCE by default.

01:48.920 --> 01:51.000
And they've only got an offline installer at the moment.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.120
So it's XFCE or nothing.

01:54.120 --> 01:57.160
But then obviously you can install anything you want on top of that.

01:57.160 --> 02:01.280
But supposedly in the works is an online installer which will allow you to pick from a bunch

02:01.280 --> 02:02.520
of other desktop environments.

02:02.520 --> 02:07.200
So if you want your GNOME or Plasma or whatever, then that will be coming.

02:07.200 --> 02:12.440
Yeah, but I would still encourage folks out there, even if they're not big XFCE users,

02:12.440 --> 02:15.520
check it out because it may surprise you.

02:15.520 --> 02:20.400
At first pass, you might even question if it is indeed XFCE because they're using modern

02:20.400 --> 02:25.920
GTK themes and some modern design ideas that just make it look really sharp.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.040
It's a great implementation.

02:28.040 --> 02:35.600
And it's nice to see another great option for easy to use, simple to set up, Arch.

02:35.600 --> 02:40.480
And just like an Arch box, when you boot this thing up for the first time, they've installed

02:40.480 --> 02:43.440
one of the graphical Arch news projects.

02:43.440 --> 02:48.180
So right up on my screen was a whole bunch of news about different package changes and

02:48.180 --> 02:49.180
all of that.

02:49.180 --> 02:54.440
I must have had nearly 80 packages to update after my install, maybe even more.

02:54.440 --> 02:58.740
But it felt good to use Pacman again.

02:58.740 --> 03:01.680
And that was a nice implementation of XFCE.

03:01.680 --> 03:07.400
And I am so happy to say that this really does appear to be its own thing.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.400
I'm glad Endeavor OS is here.

03:09.400 --> 03:13.800
And I really can't wait to hear more when you guys dive in on Choose Linux coming out

03:13.800 --> 03:14.800
later this week.

03:14.800 --> 03:18.120
Yeah, we're going to give it a go and spoiler, it's going to be pretty positive.

03:18.120 --> 03:21.040
That'll be at chooselinux.show.

03:21.040 --> 03:24.880
And you can go to chooselinux.show slash subscribe if you're not already to get that episode

03:24.880 --> 03:25.960
this week.

03:25.960 --> 03:30.580
There's also, well, I won't spoil it, but there's a really great handy app pick in that

03:30.580 --> 03:36.640
that I've already installed because I got the exclusive sneak peek at it.

03:36.640 --> 03:41.680
Something else I've used for a little while now and it's coming in a different form is

03:41.680 --> 03:48.600
Retroarch and this may be Steam's biggest emulation launch yet.

03:48.600 --> 03:55.280
But I'm putting that in quotes because there could be a big maybe in this story.

03:55.280 --> 04:00.200
Yeah, I was very surprised to hear that Retroarch was coming to Steam.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.560
Of course, this is the open source emulation platform.

04:03.560 --> 04:08.160
But what comes with an emulation platform are the actual emulators.

04:08.160 --> 04:13.080
And that is often a legal gray area, not to mention the actual ROMs that you run on it,

04:13.080 --> 04:16.520
which is also a bit of a legal gray area.

04:16.520 --> 04:18.160
Retroarch is so great.

04:18.160 --> 04:24.120
It has a UI that hearkens back to the very first iterations of the PlayStation 3 UI.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.680
It's really nice and clean.

04:25.680 --> 04:29.760
It fits well on a widescreen television.

04:29.760 --> 04:37.960
Now if everything goes as planned, Retroarch will land in the Steam store on July 30th.

04:37.960 --> 04:42.920
Now just a disclaimer, at first it will be the Windows only version.

04:42.920 --> 04:47.240
The team does plan to launch the Linux and Mac OS versions, but they just want to absorb

04:47.240 --> 04:49.760
the support of the Windows version first.

04:49.760 --> 04:53.880
They're concerned about essentially getting tons of more users and I think rightfully

04:53.880 --> 04:54.880
so.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.680
But you can go get it for your Linux box today.

04:56.680 --> 04:57.680
I've used it before.

04:57.680 --> 04:58.680
It's great.

04:58.680 --> 04:59.760
And Joe's right.

04:59.760 --> 05:06.260
It makes it really simple to get, say, the Dolphin emulator or any emulator for basically

05:06.260 --> 05:09.320
any platform, including legal ones like DOSBox.

05:09.320 --> 05:14.880
And it also makes it pretty easy to get the ROMs or cores as they call them.

05:14.880 --> 05:15.960
It's a great platform.

05:15.960 --> 05:16.960
I love it.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.120
I am surprised to see it coming to Steam.

05:19.120 --> 05:22.680
And I'm sure by default it won't ship with anything that's not legal.

05:22.680 --> 05:29.200
But much like the Kodi argument often goes, it's only a few menu entries and maybe a community

05:29.200 --> 05:31.840
repo away and you can install anything you want.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.560
It's not Kodi's fault, but the software does enable it.

05:34.560 --> 05:38.760
And we've seen that get things like Kodi boxes in trouble before.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.140
So Valve may be watching this very carefully.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.720
The project is trying to couch it.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.120
In fact, they say there really is nothing to do with emulators.

05:46.120 --> 05:50.280
I mean, sure you can use it for that, but there's other things you could use RetroArch

05:50.280 --> 05:51.280
for.

05:51.280 --> 05:54.040
I'm not sure what those use cases are.

05:54.040 --> 05:59.400
So although Valve doesn't really appear to have any specific rules about whether emulators

05:59.400 --> 06:06.280
are allowed or not, piracy obviously isn't, but emulators themselves aren't I think implicitly

06:06.280 --> 06:07.280
disallowed.

06:07.280 --> 06:10.840
Moral of the story is just go get RetroArch on your Linux box now.

06:10.840 --> 06:14.500
Well, yeah, it's a great piece of open source software and great that it's getting the exposure,

06:14.500 --> 06:16.640
the mainstream exposure of being in Steam.

06:16.640 --> 06:21.040
Yeah, for those Windows users out there, maybe you're playing around with the Windows subsystem

06:21.040 --> 06:22.040
for Linux.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.040
I know I would be.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.040
I've given it a crack.

06:24.040 --> 06:29.840
Recently, I did install the insider builds of Windows and then had to do a whole bunch

06:29.840 --> 06:31.360
of more patches.

06:31.360 --> 06:37.120
And then I did get WSL2 installed, yay me, for a couple of days and then I stopped using

06:37.120 --> 06:38.120
Windows.

06:38.120 --> 06:42.560
But for those of you who prefer to use Windows, there's something that might help you run

06:42.560 --> 06:43.560
Ubuntu now.

06:43.560 --> 06:51.360
Yeah, there's a new meta package called Ubuntu-WSL, which is fairly limited at the moment, but

06:51.360 --> 06:57.080
I think the plan is to expand it to give you a bunch of tools to just make Ubuntu work

06:57.080 --> 06:58.880
better on the subsystem.

06:58.880 --> 07:04.400
Yeah, and it seems like the message here is more will be added to this meta package.

07:04.400 --> 07:09.960
Today it's really a collection of utilities, for example, some that let you create shortcuts

07:09.960 --> 07:14.540
on the Windows desktop to launch right into that particular instance and shell, start

07:14.540 --> 07:20.560
the Windows browser with WSL view, which can be very handy if you want to pass URLs around.

07:20.560 --> 07:24.800
And the plan is to add updates to the meta package as they add these features to make

07:24.800 --> 07:28.560
it integrate in with Ubuntu and WSL better.

07:28.560 --> 07:33.720
I get the sense here, Joe, is that Canonical is going to look at the Windows subsystem

07:33.720 --> 07:37.720
for Linux as just another platform that they target.

07:37.720 --> 07:45.020
They spin up images for a lot of cloud providers and other particular hardware use cases.

07:45.020 --> 07:47.520
This is just yet another target platform now.

07:47.520 --> 07:51.080
Well, yeah, and it shows that they are very serious about this platform.

07:51.080 --> 07:54.000
It's not something that they're just leaving to rot.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.400
They're actively developing for it and treating it as an equal citizen with all those other

07:59.400 --> 08:02.400
use cases like the cloud providers.

08:02.400 --> 08:09.080
If I was using Windows, Joe, if I was doing system administration or development and my

08:09.080 --> 08:14.860
boxes that I was developing for or managing were Ubuntu, I would be pretty thankful that

08:14.860 --> 08:20.280
Canonical is actually taking this seriously because this would be a real tool for me.

08:20.280 --> 08:25.400
I have lived in environments where Windows was the OS I had to use for work, and I was

08:25.400 --> 08:33.200
a Linux user, and something like this would sort of be like at least a lifeline.

08:33.200 --> 08:38.000
So I just channeling former Chris would really appreciate them actually putting the effort

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
into this.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.500
And there's other distributions in there too, but it's nice to see this going to a whole

08:41.500 --> 08:46.160
other level now with the Meta package, and then of course there's other distros out there

08:46.160 --> 08:52.780
like Penguin, which is a sort of a Meta Linux designed specifically for the subsystem.

08:52.780 --> 08:54.080
That's fascinating as well.

08:54.080 --> 08:58.720
There's some interesting things happening in Linux land on Windows.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.520
It's weird, Joe, it's weird.

09:00.520 --> 09:07.840
It is weird, but it's not as weird as Evil Gnome, which is quite rare spyware or malware

09:07.840 --> 09:09.800
for the Linux desktop.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.800
Feels good.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.800
Feels real good.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.080
Like somebody noticed this, Joe.

09:13.080 --> 09:14.080
We got noticed.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.080
It's great.

09:15.080 --> 09:20.320
And what's even better is it's done as a gnome extension, at least it disguises itself as

09:20.320 --> 09:23.000
a gnome extension.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.240
And it does all kinds of things like screen cap, listen to your audio, and it's got a

09:27.240 --> 09:28.240
great name.

09:28.240 --> 09:32.480
I think if you find it, you get to name it Intezer, I believe is the company's name.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.240
They're the ones that came across this.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.480
And it looks like it hides itself fairly well.

09:37.480 --> 09:41.560
I think you could potentially be infected with this and not necessarily notice it.

09:41.560 --> 09:45.720
It's not like a crypto miner where suddenly you'd notice that, hang on, why is everything

09:45.720 --> 09:47.200
so sluggish?

09:47.200 --> 09:51.600
And then you'd have a look in top or whatever, and see something blatantly pegging your CPU.

09:51.600 --> 09:55.520
Whereas this is going to just kind of sit there and do its thing and potentially not

09:55.520 --> 09:57.000
be noticed by people.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Yeah.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.280
And it may be what we're seeing.

10:00.280 --> 10:04.280
This is some samples that VirusTotal have analyzed in other companies.

10:04.280 --> 10:08.560
It may be kind of an early stage version of this that is sort of going to be offered up

10:08.560 --> 10:12.200
as a package that people could buy if they want to target Linux users.

10:12.200 --> 10:16.680
And it's modular too, and it uses cron for some of its nefarious scheduling.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.400
So it's a pretty clever little thing.

10:19.400 --> 10:23.040
In fact, those modules, it's broken into five different modules, and this gives you an idea

10:23.040 --> 10:24.360
of what it does.

10:24.360 --> 10:29.240
Shooter sound captures the audio from a user's microphone and then uploads it to the command

10:29.240 --> 10:30.880
and control server.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.200
Shooter image captures the screenshots.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.960
Shooter file scans the file system.

10:35.960 --> 10:39.680
Also watches for newly created files and then uploads them.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.680
Really handy.

10:40.680 --> 10:44.120
A shooter ping, it's what receives new commands.

10:44.120 --> 10:47.040
And then shooter key, which isn't quite completed yet.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.200
Like I said, this is kind of early.

10:49.200 --> 10:56.040
This is like a test version, but shooter key is most likely an unfinished keylogger module

10:56.040 --> 10:57.960
that you turn on.

10:57.960 --> 10:58.960
And it's great.

10:58.960 --> 11:01.160
It's multi-process architected.

11:01.160 --> 11:05.040
It looks like it's part of your gnome desktop experience.

11:05.040 --> 11:10.720
It installs itself to.cache, gnome software, gnome shell extensions, and attempt to look

11:10.720 --> 11:12.880
like a gnome extension.

11:12.880 --> 11:19.400
And it runs gnome-shell-extension.sh, which would look like a valid extension process

11:19.400 --> 11:21.920
to fire off those different modules.

11:21.920 --> 11:27.040
So is this a one-off then, or is this the start of a new era, do you think?

11:27.040 --> 11:31.440
I mean, it is a platform to build from, for sure.

11:31.440 --> 11:37.520
Evil gnome is kind of rare too, because it is so specifically targeting desktop Linux

11:37.520 --> 11:39.120
users.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.040
The economics of it, I'm not so sure of.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.440
Where it's going to go, I'm not so sure of.

11:42.440 --> 11:47.120
It seems to be backed by a group that is known for making Windows malware that is of similar

11:47.120 --> 11:50.920
functionality, and now this is just their Linux version.

11:50.920 --> 11:53.960
So I don't suspect it's going to be widespread.

11:53.960 --> 11:57.880
I think it's going to be a tool people can purchase for targeted attacks.

11:57.880 --> 12:02.320
But of course, the technical breakdown that we have linked in the show notes speculates

12:02.320 --> 12:07.940
that this might actually become more widespread as it matures and people grab different versions

12:07.940 --> 12:08.940
of it.

12:08.940 --> 12:09.940
So we'll see.

12:09.940 --> 12:11.520
Their speculation is a little more worst-case scenario.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.520
Mine is more like targeted attacks.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.320
But the full breakdown is linked in the show notes.

12:15.320 --> 12:21.400
It feels like everything's coming to Linux, eh, Skype, Spotify, Steam, malware.

12:21.400 --> 12:28.000
And even MacBook Pro keyboards, at least starting with Linux 5.3, although don't get too excited

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
yet.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
There's a caveat.

12:30.000 --> 12:35.120
We may get initial support for MacBook keyboards and the trackpads.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.440
Yeah, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago and it didn't look good at all.

12:38.440 --> 12:44.440
That was when the SSDs were finally supported with the kernel module.

12:44.440 --> 12:48.960
And we didn't think it was going to be possible to support the keyboard and trackpad, at least

12:48.960 --> 12:49.960
not for a while.

12:49.960 --> 12:53.840
But in typical Linux hacker fashion, they've made it happen.

12:53.840 --> 12:59.560
This is great news for people who want to use the Apple hardware with Linux.

12:59.560 --> 13:04.040
It's not going to be right away, but at least those machines are not going to be completely

13:04.040 --> 13:06.240
useless when Apple abandons them software-wise.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.240
Yeah.

13:07.240 --> 13:12.000
Well, it's also really good for people that want to do software support or data rescue

13:12.000 --> 13:13.200
or forensics.

13:13.200 --> 13:17.960
So really, if you want all of the goodies to land, like Joe said, you kind of have to

13:17.960 --> 13:18.960
wait a little bit.

13:18.960 --> 13:26.600
The kernel 5.4 will have, in theory, the MVNE patch and the keyboard and trackpad patch.

13:26.600 --> 13:31.560
The keyboard and trackpad stuff is in kernel 5.3, but the drive stuff doesn't land until

13:31.560 --> 13:35.160
5.4, at least as things are planned now.

13:35.160 --> 13:40.200
Keep in mind that this has been an issue since the end of 2015, so it's kind of been a while

13:40.200 --> 13:41.200
now.

13:41.200 --> 13:45.640
What really happened is on the newer generation of MacBooks, they took those devices off the

13:45.640 --> 13:51.560
USB bus and made them SPI devices, which is really kind of, nobody does that.

13:51.560 --> 13:57.120
And they also never documented the SPI protocol that their controller uses to communicate

13:57.120 --> 13:59.200
with the devices.

13:59.200 --> 14:06.720
So thankfully, a developer had time to reverse engineer large portions of the protocol, not

14:06.720 --> 14:11.640
all of it yet, but has been able to write a basic Linux driver.

14:11.640 --> 14:15.480
There's still some things that need to be worked out, but what's known today as good

14:15.480 --> 14:22.200
enough for basic usage, and when you combine that with the MVNE patches that will land

14:22.200 --> 14:27.720
in 5.4, after four years, we're finally able to get control of the mouse and keyboard and

14:27.720 --> 14:28.880
write and read to the disk.

14:28.880 --> 14:34.200
It's all very early, so I mean, it could be another four years before it's really production

14:34.200 --> 14:35.200
grade.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.200
Who knows?

14:36.200 --> 14:37.200
Maybe it'll go much quicker now that the basics are in.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.200
Maybe it's a couple of years.

14:38.200 --> 14:43.080
Maybe it's a year, but it's not quite there yet, but it's so great to see, at least after

14:43.080 --> 14:45.600
four years of having nothing, this level of breakthrough.

14:45.600 --> 14:50.360
But it doesn't really matter if it does take another couple of years to become solid.

14:50.360 --> 14:54.720
What matters is that it happens eventually, because you would imagine that these MacBooks

14:54.720 --> 14:59.520
are going to get supported with macOS for at least another few years.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.560
But then Apple just abandons stuff, don't they?

15:02.560 --> 15:08.080
Like my old MacBook Pro that I've got with the amazing speakers, that's just been completely

15:08.080 --> 15:10.880
abandoned but works perfectly with Linux now.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.200
I think it's about, what, five years, is that what you said?

15:13.200 --> 15:14.200
Five years?

15:14.200 --> 15:15.200
Is that what macOS is?

15:15.200 --> 15:16.200
That's my rough recollection.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.880
It's something like that, I think, yeah.

15:18.880 --> 15:26.120
I think what's less of a risk with this SPI protocol and reverse engineering how the T2

15:26.120 --> 15:33.720
RAID chip works, them not supporting the macOS on that model of machine is, I think, going

15:33.720 --> 15:34.720
to happen.

15:34.720 --> 15:35.720
It's a known risk.

15:35.720 --> 15:40.600
And, you know, five years is a good amount of time for us to try to work this out, apparently.

15:40.600 --> 15:44.080
However, I think the larger risk, that is a risk, but I think the larger risk is that

15:44.080 --> 15:49.120
Apple moves on to something else completely different, like a T3 chip or a T10 chip.

15:49.120 --> 15:54.000
And it's, once again, a totally new device or a totally new protocol.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.440
And then yet another generation of machines are unsupported.

15:57.440 --> 16:03.680
All of the rumors in the Mac Pro area right now suggest that there are new keyboards in

16:03.680 --> 16:04.680
the works.

16:04.680 --> 16:07.340
And that could be a moment where they change it all over again.

16:07.340 --> 16:08.340
Or maybe not.

16:08.340 --> 16:09.340
Yeah, who knows?

16:09.340 --> 16:13.880
Maybe eventually they'll probably switch over to ARM, at least for the Airs and whatever,

16:13.880 --> 16:16.320
you know, the lower end stuff.

16:16.320 --> 16:21.520
But the hardware that's out there already that would otherwise just sit in a drawer

16:21.520 --> 16:25.440
or on a shelf somewhere could actually be actively used.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.400
And that's one of the great things about Linux.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.400
Exactly.

16:28.400 --> 16:32.000
And I'll just point out that while I think, you know, there's definitely a work scenario

16:32.000 --> 16:39.880
and a use case for Apple hardware, one of the things that I prefer about Linux and the

16:39.880 --> 16:44.640
ecosystem around it is a much higher level of predictability.

16:44.640 --> 16:48.000
You know, we can sit here and tell you this is going to land in kernel 5.3 and this is

16:48.000 --> 16:53.400
going to land in kernel 5.4, and then you know from that moment forward it's supported.

16:53.400 --> 16:56.560
With this kind of stuff, you're guessing when it comes to Apple.

16:56.560 --> 16:58.240
It's that they like to be a black box.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.400
That's part of the allure, part of their magic.

17:00.400 --> 17:05.080
I get it, but when it comes to my work and my job, I just don't prefer it.

17:05.080 --> 17:06.760
I prefer predictability.

17:06.760 --> 17:11.780
I prefer the open, transparent nature of free software development.

17:11.780 --> 17:17.080
And that's why for me, and I think maybe for a lot of people out there, Linux makes a better

17:17.080 --> 17:18.080
engineering workstation.

17:18.080 --> 17:21.320
At the end of the day, it's just a more predictable platform.

17:21.320 --> 17:27.240
I know that sounds crazy, but at this level it is just simply a more predictable platform

17:27.240 --> 17:28.240
for me.

17:28.240 --> 17:32.840
One of the great things about the Linux and open source community is that often when someone

17:32.840 --> 17:38.120
has had enough of a project, they'll step down responsibly, like we saw with Antigos,

17:38.120 --> 17:41.960
and then something great will be born out of it, like Endeavor OS.

17:41.960 --> 17:48.040
And this week, the maintainer for gpodder.net has said that he's had enough of that, but

17:48.040 --> 17:49.440
he's not just dropping it.

17:49.440 --> 17:52.440
He's actively looking for someone to replace him.

17:52.440 --> 17:56.560
Yeah, gpodder is one of those great applications that I've used forever.

17:56.560 --> 18:01.440
It's a GTK Linux desktop podcast client, in a nutshell.

18:01.440 --> 18:06.080
And you just give it an RSS feed and it just dutifully downloads it from henceforth.

18:06.080 --> 18:10.960
And there is a website web service component to it as well that needs to be kept up to

18:10.960 --> 18:12.240
date and secure, obviously.

18:12.240 --> 18:16.340
And there's some basic maintainership of the application to keep it current.

18:16.340 --> 18:21.480
The requirements appear to be some Python knowledge, basic understanding of web technologies,

18:21.480 --> 18:23.880
and an understanding of relational databases.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.600
However, that said, I think there is a lot of opportunity with gpodder.

18:27.600 --> 18:33.240
In fact, I think it could be one of the larger, more successful desktop Linux applications

18:33.240 --> 18:37.340
that could be monetized, just my opinion.

18:37.340 --> 18:41.080
So I really hope this finds a new home and somebody who's really fired up and enthusiastic

18:41.080 --> 18:43.380
about keeping it going.

18:43.380 --> 18:47.920
And I have so much gratitude and respect to Stefan for keeping it alive as long as he

18:47.920 --> 18:48.920
has.

18:48.920 --> 18:55.760
He has been one of those tried and true desktop applications that has just continued to tick

18:55.760 --> 18:58.600
away and work for me year after year.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.760
And I hope somebody takes it on and it keeps going.

19:00.760 --> 19:05.520
Because he says, if somebody doesn't, it's likely he'd have to shut the project down

19:05.520 --> 19:06.520
by the end of 2019.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.440
Yeah, I really hope someone does step up for this.

19:09.440 --> 19:13.640
But I think you're playing down the web service aspect of this.

19:13.640 --> 19:19.640
It's a podcast directory, much like iTunes or Apple Podcasts, as they call it now.

19:19.640 --> 19:23.320
It's a place that you can search for new podcasts.

19:23.320 --> 19:29.480
And at the moment, if your podcast isn't on iTunes, then it's pretty much not in any applications.

19:29.480 --> 19:32.720
Whereas if you go for something that's a bit more freedom respecting, like AntennaPod,

19:32.720 --> 19:35.440
you can specifically search gpodder.net.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.360
And I think we're in there, but then some of our other shows aren't.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.840
So we need to get on that, I think.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.280
Yeah, it just needs some love.

19:43.280 --> 19:49.840
Just like Jono's show Shot of Jack, which I don't think has had an episode since 2010,

19:49.840 --> 19:54.760
maybe, is in the trending or popular section.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.720
The Linux action show AugFeed is also in there.

19:57.720 --> 20:01.680
It's like number 20 in there or something like that, which I don't think that's a very

20:01.680 --> 20:02.680
active feed anymore.

20:02.680 --> 20:06.120
So I think the web service needs some love, too.

20:06.120 --> 20:10.220
And it's such a great idea, and we have so few open alternatives.

20:10.220 --> 20:13.520
And it is a nice, clean, simple UI.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.520
It just needs some data love.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.520
And it could be there.

20:16.520 --> 20:19.640
Yeah, this is why I wanted to bring this up on the show, to shine a light on it and spread

20:19.640 --> 20:22.480
the word and hope that other people spread the word.

20:22.480 --> 20:26.320
And fingers crossed, we'll get someone who steps up and takes over.

20:26.320 --> 20:30.640
Be sure to check out linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes

20:30.640 --> 20:35.240
of this here show, as we'll cover everything that develops and distill it all down into

20:35.240 --> 20:38.040
one easy to consume per week episode.

20:38.040 --> 20:42.040
And you can go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

20:42.040 --> 20:49.600
And I have to give a personal, strong recommendation that you go over to error.show slash 70 and

20:49.600 --> 20:53.960
listen to old and insecure episode 70 of the User Error Program.

20:53.960 --> 21:00.760
It is such a good show, and I absolutely loved every single minute of episode 70.

21:00.760 --> 21:05.200
Yeah, the best thing I ever did was asking Dan and Poppy to come and join me on that

21:05.200 --> 21:06.200
show.

21:06.200 --> 21:10.360
And we'll see you next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

21:10.360 --> 21:11.960
I'm at Chris LAS.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.640
I'm at Joel Wessington.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.240
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week.

21:16.240 --> 21:36.680
Take care, I'll talk to you later.
