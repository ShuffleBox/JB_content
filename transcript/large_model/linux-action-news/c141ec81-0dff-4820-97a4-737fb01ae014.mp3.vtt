Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 117, recorded on August 4th, 2019. I'm Chris.

00:10.360 --> 00:11.360
And I'm Joe.

00:11.360 --> 00:15.600
Hello, Joe. Good to be connected with you on a very busy news week. Let's start off

00:15.600 --> 00:19.560
with Mangero's plans to ship Free Office.

00:19.560 --> 00:26.080
Yeah, Free Office, which is free as in beer, but not free as in freedom. This is a proprietary

00:26.080 --> 00:33.120
suite, which they had initially planned to ship by default in Mangero. But then after

00:33.120 --> 00:37.480
a fair bit of backlash, shall we say, they've decided that they're not going to ship it

00:37.480 --> 00:42.420
by default, but they'll give you the option to install it, or LibreOffice, or no Office

00:42.420 --> 00:43.420
Suite.

00:43.420 --> 00:48.440
A pretty common reaction online was negative. People thought it was a bad idea to shove

00:48.440 --> 00:54.880
a proprietary Office product into a free Linux distribution when LibreOffice exists and it's

00:54.880 --> 00:58.920
pretty functional. I had a chance to chat with Philip, one of the founders of Mangero

00:58.920 --> 01:04.640
on Linux Unplugged 3.12. And what I took away from the conversation was that it was more

01:04.640 --> 01:10.680
about trying to create a bit of differentiation for Mangero from the rest of the pack.

01:10.680 --> 01:15.000
So there's something unique about the distribution, but also trying to improve compatibility for

01:15.000 --> 01:22.640
users that treat their Office Suite like a tool. And they wanted perhaps improve compatibility

01:22.640 --> 01:26.360
with the commercial products on the market, which SoftMaker's free Office is pretty well

01:26.360 --> 01:31.260
known for. I think the project looked at it as a very practical move. There was no monetary

01:31.260 --> 01:35.560
exchange to take it on. It was more of a let's just try to do something different and improve

01:35.560 --> 01:39.820
compatibility for users. The reaction was strong. And so now it sounds like it'll be

01:39.820 --> 01:41.320
an option during install.

01:41.320 --> 01:45.720
Yeah, you're going to be faced with a screen that gives you the option of either free Office,

01:45.720 --> 01:50.160
LibreOffice, or no Office Suite. And I think that's what they should have done in the first

01:50.160 --> 01:56.720
place, really. I think that it was a bad idea to ship proprietary software by default. Fair

01:56.720 --> 02:01.360
enough to give people the option to install it. But I think just having that on your default

02:01.360 --> 02:08.480
ISO is just, it's not a great look really for a Linux distribution.

02:08.480 --> 02:14.680
I think I agree. Making an option is best for everyone. Because myself, when I install

02:14.680 --> 02:19.040
Mangero, I'll choose the no Office option. That's perfect for me. I don't really want

02:19.040 --> 02:26.800
it. I don't use it that much. So that's what my dog in this hunt is, full disclosure. However,

02:26.800 --> 02:30.140
so I could have an informed conversation with Philip, I downloaded free Office and gave

02:30.140 --> 02:35.160
it a go. And after using it for about an hour and opened up a couple of different things,

02:35.160 --> 02:40.140
compared it to LibreOffice and Google Docs, which is my, sorry to say, when I do need

02:40.140 --> 02:47.120
a word processor or spreadsheet, I use Google Docs. So I compared it to that as well. And

02:47.120 --> 02:52.520
I walked away with something. And that is good enough is not good enough for people

02:52.520 --> 02:57.740
that are opening up business documents, where they need to properly be able to import proprietary

02:57.740 --> 03:02.520
Office formats and then save as different proprietary Office formats and keep functionality,

03:02.520 --> 03:06.880
make sure formatting is correct, and have a workflow that's really similar. Imagine

03:06.880 --> 03:13.000
that mythical migrating user who's coming from Windows to Linux, free Office sort of

03:13.000 --> 03:20.520
replicates that Office look and feel, combined with the compatibility. And in my experience,

03:20.520 --> 03:26.080
it's also faster, a little faster, starts up a little bit quicker, feels a little lightweight

03:26.080 --> 03:31.800
on the system. And you combine that with the look and feel and the compatibility. I think

03:31.800 --> 03:35.720
it is a solid argument that it's better than LibreOffice for a certain type of worker.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.160
So again, I think having the option to install is a good thing.

03:38.160 --> 03:43.520
Yeah, by all means, make it easy to install this proprietary Office suite and point people

03:43.520 --> 03:47.440
towards it and recommend it or whatever. But I just think shipping it by default, it's

03:47.440 --> 03:51.840
just crossing a line. Some people talked about shipping graphics drivers by default, but

03:51.840 --> 03:57.160
I think that's different. That is making the most of your hardware. Whereas this is just

03:57.160 --> 04:02.880
different. This is productivity software that we're talking about that you don't actually

04:02.880 --> 04:05.680
need to make your computer work properly.

04:05.680 --> 04:10.320
Yeah, I agree. There's not an equivalence to a hardware enablement. But there could

04:10.320 --> 04:17.720
be an equivalence to codecs or making Steam super simple to install. You don't need Steam

04:17.720 --> 04:23.620
to make your computer work. You don't need H.264 playback and MP3 playback to make your

04:23.620 --> 04:28.680
computer work. It's nice to have, just like opening up Office documents that you need

04:28.680 --> 04:32.000
to interact with to do your job is nice to have.

04:32.000 --> 04:37.800
Yeah, but there is no open source version of Steam. There's no open Steam or whatever.

04:37.800 --> 04:43.000
There are different ways to get games that can be open source or whatever. But I don't

04:43.000 --> 04:48.480
think that is a fair equivalent because LibreOffice is good enough for some people, at least for

04:48.480 --> 04:53.400
me. And I use it actually quite a bit and I just have no need for a proprietary Office

04:53.400 --> 04:59.080
suite. I think it comes down to make it easy to install, but don't ship it by default.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.080
That's what I personally want to see.

05:01.080 --> 05:05.420
That's reasonable and I can't really argue that. I want to sort of pivot for a second

05:05.420 --> 05:09.160
and talk about the meta aspect of this story, which we in a way have touched on several

05:09.160 --> 05:16.600
times this year already. And that is outrage driven development. Project announces intention

05:16.600 --> 05:26.440
to do X, community reacts very strongly, and then project amends announcement to do Y instead,

05:26.440 --> 05:31.400
which is generally a compromise in some way. And sometimes that truly is for the best,

05:31.400 --> 05:35.700
like in the case of the 32-bit support for Ubuntu. I am reminded of that famous Steve

05:35.700 --> 05:41.320
Job quote that's roughly, if you asked consumers before the automobile came out what they wanted,

05:41.320 --> 05:43.040
they'd say a stronger, faster horse.

05:43.040 --> 05:47.040
Yeah, I do get what you're saying there, but this is open source development we're talking

05:47.040 --> 05:52.920
about and it's supposed to be a community effort. And okay, some people go about it

05:52.920 --> 05:58.520
in the wrong way, being too strident and Twitter rants and all the rest of it, but isn't the

05:58.520 --> 06:03.880
whole point of it that the community drives the direction of development?

06:03.880 --> 06:08.600
Absolutely. You quantified it right there. That's why I'm worried because Twitter and

06:08.600 --> 06:15.060
the forums don't represent the tens and tens of thousands of people that are running Manjaro.

06:15.060 --> 06:19.680
Just as the people that got really upset on Twitter and the dozen or so news articles

06:19.680 --> 06:25.800
were written and the outrage comments on Reddit don't represent the tens of millions of Ubuntu

06:25.800 --> 06:33.760
desktop users. But yet what we talk about as community is just a hyper-representation

06:33.760 --> 06:39.000
of the most outraged individuals who are taking the effort to go to different outlets, some

06:39.000 --> 06:43.640
which are very low effort like Reddit and Twitter, and they're expressing their outrage.

06:43.640 --> 06:49.760
I saw so many comments about people dropping Manjaro over this. This sort of, I want to

06:49.760 --> 06:53.080
punish them attitude for doing this. It's not just that people are upset, they want

06:53.080 --> 06:58.380
to punish them. And then the developers, who all of a sudden have this onslaught of very

06:58.380 --> 07:05.880
loud feedback, cave because we all see this as this is the voice of the community when

07:05.880 --> 07:11.720
it's just the representation of a small portion. You know this because our shows have a lot

07:11.720 --> 07:17.240
more people downloading than we get comments from. And it's just the nature of doing business

07:17.240 --> 07:22.400
on the internet. You get a lot of people that just enjoy content or will use a distribution,

07:22.400 --> 07:26.760
faithfully upgrade from release to release of Manjaro and be perfectly happy with it

07:26.760 --> 07:30.400
and not really care. You know most people probably just figure, right, well if they

07:30.400 --> 07:34.720
install FreeOffice, I'll just uninstall it and then I'll install LibreOffice. Job done.

07:34.720 --> 07:40.680
And that's it. End of story. And what we end up getting is this hyper-representation from

07:40.680 --> 07:46.560
the outrage. And that's really what bothers me here is because that is driving decisions.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.440
And it's not fully representative of the entire community.

07:49.440 --> 07:53.480
There's not really a way to get representation from the entire community. You just have to

07:53.480 --> 07:58.840
listen to the vocal people or ignore them or whatever. They are the people who are in

07:58.840 --> 08:04.560
your community who are talking to you. And so you have to decide whether you think that

08:04.560 --> 08:11.960
they are a true representation of the silent majority or whether they're just crackpots

08:11.960 --> 08:15.560
or whatever. And that is a difficult thing to do.

08:15.560 --> 08:18.800
I think it's a skill you have to build up. I think it's something that takes perhaps

08:18.800 --> 08:24.400
years of exposure to calibrate correctly. And some personality types may be better or

08:24.400 --> 08:29.600
worse at handling that kind of feedback as well. So there's a personal factor in there.

08:29.600 --> 08:34.280
Yeah, but it's just part of running a project. You just have to be able to deal with this

08:34.280 --> 08:35.280
stuff.

08:35.280 --> 08:39.320
Add that to the list of required skills to run a large open source project. All right,

08:39.320 --> 08:44.680
problem solved. Moving on to other large open source projects are coming together, perhaps

08:44.680 --> 08:46.520
maybe to benefit end users.

08:46.520 --> 08:50.840
Yeah, the Linux App Summit is going to be held in Barcelona in November from the 12th

08:50.840 --> 08:56.880
to the 15th. And there's going to be representatives from both KDE and GNOME all working together

08:56.880 --> 08:57.880
there.

08:57.880 --> 09:01.280
Joe, I believe this is the artist formerly known as the Libre Application Summit. But

09:01.280 --> 09:06.040
I think that was when it was more just the GNOME camp. And now that KDE and GNOME folks

09:06.040 --> 09:10.760
are coming together to sort of talk about some future collaboration on the desktop,

09:10.760 --> 09:15.880
they've renamed it. And it's, I think, a pretty positive sign of where the two projects could

09:15.880 --> 09:19.380
be going in the future. And the headlines are going crazy. They're coming together to

09:19.380 --> 09:24.400
create a new desktop era for Linux. I don't know about that. But it seems like it's a

09:24.400 --> 09:29.080
good sign. And it's looking like this is the next generation or the next phase of this

09:29.080 --> 09:30.080
conference.

09:30.080 --> 09:35.960
But really, this isn't anything hugely new, because the different projects in open source

09:35.960 --> 09:42.120
have generally worked together before. And this supposed rivalry between GNOME and KDE

09:42.120 --> 09:48.720
is just not even really true. It's the users, if anything, might be starting this. But I

09:48.720 --> 09:54.400
think that what actually stands out here is that they're going to actively start working

09:54.400 --> 09:59.120
together, rather than just kind of playing nice with each other and occasionally interacting

09:59.120 --> 10:04.960
or whatever. This is going to be some serious coming together to improve the Linux desktop.

10:04.960 --> 10:10.800
I mean, is that pie in the sky? I don't think so. I think genuinely, this is a really good

10:10.800 --> 10:11.800
move.

10:11.800 --> 10:15.720
I think the truth lies somewhere there in the middle. Like you say, a lot of this has

10:15.720 --> 10:20.920
already been happening for a long time. There have been common standards efforts for years.

10:20.920 --> 10:24.600
I think what we're getting here is a bit of a sales pitch from a group that is trying

10:24.600 --> 10:29.080
to grow a conference into something that's a serious contender in the industry. And so

10:29.080 --> 10:35.280
they're using a lot of enthusiastic language. I'll give you an example. KDE and GNOME will

10:35.280 --> 10:40.600
no longer be taking a passive role in the free desktop sector. That's just that sentence

10:40.600 --> 10:46.840
right there. That reeks of sales bullshit. First of all, it's demeaning to the project's

10:46.840 --> 10:54.720
years of efforts. And it implies that they have somehow been just sitting around observing

10:54.720 --> 11:00.080
the free desktop market, but not actively participating in it, which is an insane sentence

11:00.080 --> 11:05.800
because they are the free desktop market. So it's just ridiculous on its face. And they

11:05.800 --> 11:10.200
then continue on with the joint influence of the two projects. The summit will shepherd

11:10.200 --> 11:17.460
the growth of the free desktop by encouraging the creation of quality applications.

11:17.460 --> 11:21.480
This is one of those fallacies that we run into a lot in open source development. We

11:21.480 --> 11:26.920
have this great belief because we have seen it work a few times, a few times super successfully

11:26.920 --> 11:34.540
too. If we build it, they will come. If we build the perfect framework, if we have the

11:34.540 --> 11:42.520
ideal toolkit, if we use just the right language, they will come. That's not what drives the

11:42.520 --> 11:52.680
desktop market. I think it should be obvious and painfully clear to this group in particular

11:52.680 --> 11:57.840
that that's not the dynamics at play in the desktop market. It hasn't been for about 25

11:57.840 --> 11:58.840
years.

11:58.840 --> 12:05.160
So a lot of this to me reads as they're really excited about this event. They hope they can

12:05.160 --> 12:09.480
lay some foundational groundwork here to really work towards something in the future. And

12:09.480 --> 12:13.240
they need a lot of people to get on board. And so they've got to talk about it in a really

12:13.240 --> 12:18.680
big way. And the way it's being represented in the rest of the community as this incredible

12:18.680 --> 12:28.440
event of the two projects coming together, while that feels good, it's just a conference.

12:28.440 --> 12:36.040
It's not like some joint declaration of cooperation that the foundations have issued with co-signatures

12:36.040 --> 12:41.040
of all of the primary developers. It's some event organizers that are promoting something

12:41.040 --> 12:43.040
that's happening in Barcelona in November.

12:43.040 --> 12:48.760
I thought I was supposed to be the cynical one. That's a very cynical read of it. I'm

12:48.760 --> 12:53.280
just much more positive. Maybe I've just swallowed the Kool-Aid on this one. But I think it's

12:53.280 --> 12:57.920
got to be good for them to be getting together and working together like this.

12:57.920 --> 13:03.040
You might be right. The way to really know would be to go. I won't be making it to Barcelona

13:03.040 --> 13:07.280
this year. But if they ever made it to the US, like next year or something, I'd check

13:07.280 --> 13:12.280
it out and see if I'm wrong. I'd sure love to see some information about how they plan

13:12.280 --> 13:17.680
to entice third-party developers. I'd like to see some action plans on how to go after

13:17.680 --> 13:22.680
the market that is creating applications that run on the cloud. That seems like such a perfect

13:22.680 --> 13:26.960
market for the free desktop groups to target. A real type of power user that's comfortable

13:26.960 --> 13:31.960
with change that needs to develop on the platform that they're targeting anyways. Oh, my gosh.

13:31.960 --> 13:36.840
They practically could just give them an invite. So maybe that'll come out of this conference.

13:36.840 --> 13:40.000
But that might just be too practical. Maybe I'm expecting too much.

13:40.000 --> 13:45.540
Maybe. Well, Barcelona in November is lovely. So maybe I could try and go.

13:45.540 --> 13:47.040
You could be our special correspondent, Joe.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.040
Yeah, yeah. Sounds good to me.

13:49.040 --> 13:52.040
You be careful. You might get held to that.

13:52.040 --> 13:58.800
All right. Well, let's talk about Android. And we got a pretty big update this week regarding

13:58.800 --> 14:00.800
search providers in Europe.

14:00.800 --> 14:05.240
I guess I was naive. I did not see it going this way. So first, it's kind of what you

14:05.240 --> 14:11.060
expect. A real basic screen in Android that will have Google and three other search providers

14:11.060 --> 14:15.680
that you can choose from that have been randomized. Google writes, we'll introduce a new way for

14:15.680 --> 14:20.080
Android users to select a search provider to power a search box on their home screen

14:20.080 --> 14:24.120
and as the default in Chrome if it's installed. Not too surprising.

14:24.120 --> 14:28.400
But if you want your search engine to be part of this, then you're pretty much going to

14:28.400 --> 14:29.400
have to pay.

14:29.400 --> 14:33.560
Now, this is the part I should have expected but hadn't really given the thought. It's

14:33.560 --> 14:38.840
going to be an auction, Joe. To get your search engine on that list next to Google's name,

14:38.840 --> 14:44.520
you have to participate in what Google calls a first price sealed bid auction to select

14:44.520 --> 14:48.560
the other general search providers that appear on the choice screen.

14:48.560 --> 14:54.240
Google will conduct auctions on a per country basis for a period from January 1st, 2020

14:54.240 --> 15:00.800
to December 31st, 2020. Following the initial round of auctions, any subsequent rounds will

15:00.800 --> 15:08.560
only occur once per year, which means these are high value spots. In each country's auction,

15:08.560 --> 15:13.200
search providers will state the price that they are willing to pay each time a user selects

15:13.200 --> 15:16.520
them from the choice screen in that given country.

15:16.520 --> 15:20.400
Yeah, and then each search engine is just going to get an invoice every month from Google.

15:20.400 --> 15:24.680
This is how many people wanted to use you, so you've got to pay us this much money. This

15:24.680 --> 15:31.840
really is Google just doing the absolute bare minimum to comply with the European Commission.

15:31.840 --> 15:37.280
And Google had previously argued that it needed that search revenue that was tied to results

15:37.280 --> 15:43.320
in Chrome and on the Android platform to monetize what they said was, quote, a significant investment

15:43.320 --> 15:47.440
in the system. However, the commission rejected that assessment, noting the billions Google

15:47.440 --> 15:53.800
earns in the Play Store alone, as well as all of that very valuable data that Google

15:53.800 --> 16:00.200
is collecting on Android users. But to monetize this, and to make it super exclusive once

16:00.200 --> 16:06.160
a year, and there's only three other slots along with Google's own search results. So

16:06.160 --> 16:10.900
it's going to be really expensive. And you have to get cracking because if you want your

16:10.900 --> 16:16.320
search engine in that list, you need to apply to bid by September 13th of 2019.

16:16.320 --> 16:20.240
But what's interesting is that if you are running a search engine, you don't necessarily

16:20.240 --> 16:27.640
have to pay to be part of this. Because if three search engines aren't willing to pay,

16:27.640 --> 16:34.120
then any of those extra slots will just be chosen at random from a list of search providers

16:34.120 --> 16:38.200
that were interested in it but didn't want to pay. So I don't know whether that's actually

16:38.200 --> 16:42.080
going to happen. It seems capitalism will probably mean that there won't be any free

16:42.080 --> 16:46.120
slots. But it'll be interesting to see whether that actually happens. Although we won't probably

16:46.120 --> 16:51.640
hear about it because this is all kind of sealed, confidential, and that no numbers

16:51.640 --> 16:53.360
are going to be revealed to the public.

16:53.360 --> 16:59.120
It does kind of make me giggle, though, picturing Bing and DuckDuckGo, like shell corporations,

16:59.120 --> 17:02.480
being set up all around the world bidding on these. So that way DuckDuckGo and Bing

17:02.480 --> 17:07.880
would be just a big conspiracy to screw with Google. That makes me laugh. Hey, let's do

17:07.880 --> 17:11.560
a quick update on DNS over HTTPS, a.k.a. Doh.

17:11.560 --> 17:16.880
Yes, I was looking to implement this by default in Firefox. But before they do that, they

17:16.880 --> 17:18.160
are running some tests.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.960
When we were talking about this a couple of weeks ago, I was kind of curious how this

17:21.960 --> 17:26.960
would work for managed networks like enterprises that have centralized DNS that they use for

17:26.960 --> 17:31.840
very specific reasons or parental controls. Well, it turns out Mozilla's thought of that,

17:31.840 --> 17:36.120
or at least they are thinking about that right now. And they're running a test. They want

17:36.120 --> 17:40.780
to understand how often users of Firefox are subjected to managed networks or parental

17:40.780 --> 17:47.960
control software. Also, a really common way to do ad blocking, right, is by DNS blocking.

17:47.960 --> 17:52.960
So they have to attempt to discover how common this is and how they can accommodate it.

17:52.960 --> 17:57.120
Selina Duckelman writes on the Mozilla blog that they'll be capturing this information

17:57.120 --> 18:03.760
locally, including when people are using safe versions of Google or YouTube. And they will

18:03.760 --> 18:08.560
analyze that and then they'll send up the metrical information, if that's a word, to

18:08.560 --> 18:12.840
the Mozilla servers, but not the actual URLs you're going to.

18:12.840 --> 18:16.620
So this is sort of a safe way to participate in the study for them without them having

18:16.620 --> 18:21.100
to actually look at all of your DNS queries and all of that garbage that would sort of

18:21.100 --> 18:26.000
violate your privacy like crazy. And of course, they are offering a way for you to opt out

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
as well.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.680
I don't really know what they're planning to do with the data that they collect here

18:29.680 --> 18:34.320
because what are they going to find out? A certain percentage of users fall into these

18:34.320 --> 18:36.400
categories. But then what?

18:36.400 --> 18:41.120
I could see a couple of uses. If it's super low, if it's like one percent of our users

18:41.120 --> 18:45.480
have managed DNS, which I doubt, but let's just say that's what it is, then that makes

18:45.480 --> 18:49.680
just a great stat in the blog where we can just completely ignore this because only one

18:49.680 --> 18:53.920
percent of our users have this problem. So it could be that. But I doubt it. I think

18:53.920 --> 19:00.040
the more generous interpretation would be they'll use this to develop the different

19:00.040 --> 19:06.880
features and support in DNS over HTTPS. So they will have to build in some types of accommodation

19:06.880 --> 19:12.720
for safe search and for managed enterprise DNS. And perhaps this will give them some

19:12.720 --> 19:15.480
insights into what areas they have to focus on.

19:15.480 --> 19:20.320
Well, right now it's pretty easy to go into the settings and enable or disable DNS over

19:20.320 --> 19:26.160
HTTPS. And I would imagine that once it is default, that's going to be similar. So I

19:26.160 --> 19:32.080
think that administrators are not going to have a hugely bad time of it. And most users

19:32.080 --> 19:37.160
will be fine. So it's going to be one more part of the setup process for people who have

19:37.160 --> 19:39.960
specific uses. I don't think it's going to be a huge issue.

19:39.960 --> 19:44.320
I started playing around with it just recently. I'm going to give it a go for a while. And

19:44.320 --> 19:50.600
I noticed now there's just a field right in there to specify your own DNS over HTTPS server.

19:50.600 --> 19:54.720
And to make that a little bit easier, there's a snap now. I think it's like it might be

19:54.720 --> 20:00.160
called like a cloud, Cloudflare or something. It's a version of the Cloudflare DNS over

20:00.160 --> 20:05.680
HTTPS proxy server that you can install on your own system and run it on your own box

20:05.680 --> 20:08.860
and try it for a little bit. It can be kind of a neat way to just mess around with the

20:08.860 --> 20:13.360
whole software stack. I'll try it for a bit, see where it goes. I think the biggest question

20:13.360 --> 20:17.320
on all of our minds is, will we ever get used to saying doh?

20:17.320 --> 20:22.480
I certainly won't. And DNS over HTTPS is a mouthful. We need something that's, I don't

20:22.480 --> 20:24.040
know, easier to say.

20:24.040 --> 20:29.280
We need a new contract, Joe. One for the web. And I think your good buddy, Tims Burners-Lee,

20:29.280 --> 20:30.840
may have just the solution.

20:30.840 --> 20:36.560
Yeah, the way he sees it, things are very different from 30 years ago when he invented

20:36.560 --> 20:40.560
the web. And he thinks that it's gone into some pretty dodgy directions. And he thinks

20:40.560 --> 20:46.680
that what we need is for everyone to sign up for this contract for the web. And suddenly,

20:46.680 --> 20:48.720
that's going to make everything much better.

20:48.720 --> 20:55.360
The idea is get major governments, major corporations, get everyone in between to literally sign

20:55.360 --> 21:00.720
a contract that companies and governments should ensure everyone can connect to the

21:00.720 --> 21:06.720
internet and keep all of the internet available, affordable, and accessible all the time, and

21:06.720 --> 21:12.560
respect and protect people's fundamental online privacy and data rights. Clearly something

21:12.560 --> 21:17.800
that's pretty easy to get behind. What company wouldn't want to be on that list? It looks

21:17.800 --> 21:23.360
dead. Burners-Lee goes on to describe this as a journey from digital adolescence to a

21:23.360 --> 21:26.940
more mature, responsible, and inclusive future.

21:26.940 --> 21:31.520
Is anyone going to pay attention to this? It seems pretty unlikely to me.

21:31.520 --> 21:35.400
I mean, maybe. I mean, a lot of my attention these days is really focused on Solid.

21:35.400 --> 21:40.120
Yeah, whatever happened to that? That was his project to... I don't even know what it

21:40.120 --> 21:43.800
was supposed to be, some sort of like next generation web or something.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.880
Yeah, a new way to do linking of data.

21:45.880 --> 21:49.840
Yeah. And if you look at the website, it says the apps are coming. The first wave of Solid

21:49.840 --> 21:56.800
apps are being created now. So who knows? Maybe he's just working on a few things at

21:56.800 --> 22:03.400
the same time. But it just feels like he's trying to stay relevant, maybe?

22:03.400 --> 22:11.400
Maybe. I'm of two minds. I do see that. It feels like these initiatives go nowhere because

22:11.400 --> 22:16.720
the internet and the web are just not a cohesive small thing that can be influenced like that

22:16.720 --> 22:23.800
anymore. But then I also think about what people say about Richard Stallman. And I'm

22:23.800 --> 22:28.520
somewhere in the middle on those particular things too. I feel like in a way, it's good

22:28.520 --> 22:35.720
to have something to strive for. Like what is the bar? What should we as citizens of

22:35.720 --> 22:39.480
the internet be pushing for? And that's a pretty good list.

22:39.480 --> 22:44.040
I could get behind that list of ideals. I could say I'm pretty skeptical anything's

22:44.040 --> 22:48.360
going to become of this. But maybe it's good to have that goalpost.

22:48.360 --> 22:53.960
Yeah, I suppose you're right. Having one good force tugging in the positive direction can't

22:53.960 --> 22:56.840
really be a bad thing. So maybe I should stop being cynical.

22:56.840 --> 23:00.000
Well, and I suppose in that regard, it's good to have his name attached to it.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.720
Yeah, I suppose. And if they can get some seriously big organizations signing up to

23:04.720 --> 23:07.880
this, then maybe it can create some momentum.

23:07.880 --> 23:11.880
Now our last story of the week. When I first saw the headline, I kind of snickered a little

23:11.880 --> 23:17.000
bit and I thought this is kind of silly. And then it clicked in my head how I would personally

23:17.000 --> 23:21.800
use this. And well, now I'm kind of excited about moving the Linux desktop into virtual

23:21.800 --> 23:29.360
reality. This may actually be a genuinely decent use case for VR on Linux.

23:29.360 --> 23:33.480
Right. Well, this I have to hear because I did not stop snickering, I'm afraid.

23:33.480 --> 23:38.000
Well, Collabra has made this announcement and it was development that's sponsored by Valve.

23:38.000 --> 23:43.400
And there's real functional code today. Those are all three, like, unusually great things

23:43.400 --> 23:49.300
about an announcement. It's called XR Desktop, and it sits on top of either Plasma or Gnome

23:49.300 --> 23:55.040
Shell and extends the window environment into virtual reality, into a 360 degree space where

23:55.040 --> 23:58.200
you can manage windows in that space.

23:58.200 --> 24:05.400
Now this is, for me, perhaps the only solution to what is otherwise an insatiable appetite

24:05.400 --> 24:11.500
for monitors that I have. I want so many screens, Joe. It's ridiculous. I would like to have,

24:11.500 --> 24:17.820
if I truly could, a screen per application. Really would. So this is actually potentially

24:17.820 --> 24:23.080
a possibility because not only can you lay windows out, but because it's a full 3D space,

24:23.080 --> 24:27.720
you can have them far away. You can move them closer. There's core elements to what they're

24:27.720 --> 24:33.400
proposing, the workflow that I find super appealing. Essentially unlimited screen space

24:33.400 --> 24:38.500
in a whole virtual world. When I'm sitting here doing these shows, I could be sitting

24:38.500 --> 24:45.640
here with a VR headset on my face with hundreds of windows. It could be paradise, Joe. I could

24:45.640 --> 24:46.640
be in ADD heaven.

24:46.640 --> 24:51.480
It sounds like a nightmare to me. I can't think of anything worse. I suffer really badly

24:51.480 --> 24:56.780
from motion sickness and it seems to be getting worse as I get older. So this, just no way

24:56.780 --> 25:04.180
would I possibly want it. It's like something from an 80s movie. It just seems laughable

25:04.180 --> 25:05.880
to me that you would want to do this.

25:05.880 --> 25:11.720
That might be why I like it too. Well, I'll tell you what. Honestly, it is so early days.

25:11.720 --> 25:18.360
This is really rough stuff. I'm very skeptical about the interface. They've done a good job

25:18.360 --> 25:24.120
to map UI controls to the VR controllers. I got to give them credit for that. I'm not

25:24.120 --> 25:29.500
on board with using my Oculus controllers to manage my desktop though. I want a keyboard

25:29.500 --> 25:34.760
and mouse. There's a lot of rough stuff here, but here's what we do know so far. It integrates

25:34.760 --> 25:39.520
with the existing desktop environment's compositors. In the case of Kaywin, it's sort of like a

25:39.520 --> 25:44.800
Compiz plugin, if you will, and in the case of Gnome Shelts and Patches. So you can run

25:44.800 --> 25:50.160
both the virtual space and your actual desktop environment at the same time if you want.

25:50.160 --> 25:54.760
They've written a GLib wrapper to Vulkan, which they call Gulkan, which makes it easy

25:54.760 --> 26:02.080
to use Vulkan rendering for this entire environment. And they have early support even for Wayland

26:02.080 --> 26:03.080
on Gnome Shelts.

26:03.080 --> 26:06.960
Now, I don't think this is going to be the future of the Linux desktop. In fact, I don't

26:06.960 --> 26:11.500
even think this is going to be a mainstream thing. But I really appreciate the idea that

26:11.500 --> 26:16.920
if you plug a VR headset into Linux in the future, there's actually something functional

26:16.920 --> 26:20.640
you can do with it. It doesn't just show up as a second weird display that has the wrong

26:20.640 --> 26:25.560
aspect ratio and Linux just looks like a dumpster fire trying to manage it. If you plug that

26:25.560 --> 26:29.040
thing in and all of a sudden your desktop applications extended to it like a mirrored

26:29.040 --> 26:33.760
environment and it was functional, that's pretty impressive. And if they just got to

26:33.760 --> 26:35.560
there, I'd be a happy camper.

26:35.560 --> 26:39.040
Yeah, fair enough. It's not something I'm going to use. But I suppose bringing more

26:39.040 --> 26:43.480
functionality on Linux to existing hardware, that's always got to be good.

26:43.480 --> 26:48.120
This is more likely going to get me to hook up my Oculus to a Linux desktop than gaming

26:48.120 --> 26:53.600
would. I know that sounds silly. But like I said, I've just got a voracious appetite

26:53.600 --> 27:00.200
for screens. I want all those screens. So then actually, I was thinking we should do

27:00.200 --> 27:04.320
a challenge and try to get Wes to set this up for us during the sprint that we're doing

27:04.320 --> 27:11.360
in a couple of weeks. Don't say anything. Don't tell anybody. We'll surprise them.

27:11.360 --> 27:15.160
They'll get Linux action news every single week at linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe

27:15.160 --> 27:17.400
for all the ways to get new episodes.

27:17.400 --> 27:21.260
And you can go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

27:21.260 --> 27:26.680
And go check out the new linuxacademy.com brand new website launch and it looks slick.

27:26.680 --> 27:30.680
Yeah. Did you have anything to do with this dark mode thing?

27:30.680 --> 27:34.640
It's taking over Joe. Oh man, I love it.

27:34.640 --> 27:38.240
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.760
I'm at Chris LAS.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.080
I am at Joe Rossington.

27:41.080 --> 27:44.040
Thank you for joining us and we will see you next week.

27:44.040 --> 28:11.040
See you later.
