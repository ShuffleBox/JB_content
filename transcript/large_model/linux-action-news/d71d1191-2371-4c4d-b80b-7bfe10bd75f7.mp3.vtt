Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.280 --> 00:20.400
This is episode 65, recorded on August 5th, 2018.

00:20.400 --> 00:21.400
I'm Chris.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.400
And I'm Tom.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.400
Hello, Joe.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.080
It's good to be connected with you.

00:25.080 --> 00:30.200
And I have to say, I'm not yet broadcasting from a tablet, but it may be in my future.

00:30.200 --> 00:37.320
Yes, Samsung has revealed the Galaxy Tab S4, which on the face of it is a fairly unremarkable

00:37.320 --> 00:38.320
tablet.

00:38.320 --> 00:44.000
But then you realize it's got this DEX software in it, which allows you to run a proper desktop

00:44.000 --> 00:48.240
on Android, which we've seen many times before.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.400
And it seems that they're going to have yet another go at it.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.400
Right.

00:52.400 --> 00:58.080
To connect this S4 tab to a monitor, both the big screen and the tablet screen can be

00:58.080 --> 00:59.760
used simultaneously.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.840
Samsung had a short demo they were showing to the press.

01:02.840 --> 01:07.360
And during that, they showed opening up to 20 windows at once.

01:07.360 --> 01:11.020
You had features like split screen, drag and drop.

01:11.020 --> 01:15.120
And it essentially functioned like a windowing desktop environment on a PC.

01:15.120 --> 01:18.760
They also mentioned that users will be able to launch the DEX software without being connected

01:18.760 --> 01:19.760
to a monitor.

01:19.760 --> 01:24.960
So you essentially get like an Android UI on the tablet's 10.5 inch screen, which is

01:24.960 --> 01:27.680
2560 by 1600.

01:27.680 --> 01:29.160
So it's a pretty big display.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.960
You could fit a few windows on that thing.

01:30.960 --> 01:34.340
But it wasn't long ago that we were talking about the DEX dock and being able to turn

01:34.340 --> 01:38.440
a phone into a proper Linux machine.

01:38.440 --> 01:41.120
Makes you wonder why can't you do that on this then?

01:41.120 --> 01:42.520
And what happened to that project?

01:42.520 --> 01:48.760
So this is, to be clear, an Android desktop environment with Android applications.

01:48.760 --> 01:53.360
In the past, when we were talking about the DEX dock, that was a Linux environment that

01:53.360 --> 01:55.700
could run some Android applications.

01:55.700 --> 01:59.080
So there seems to have been a focus change here.

01:59.080 --> 02:03.320
And that might just simply be because you already have large companies like Adobe and

02:03.320 --> 02:10.480
Microsoft and Google themselves that are working on windowed desktop style Android applications.

02:10.480 --> 02:14.320
Maybe they just put their finger up, detected the way the wind was going and changed.

02:14.320 --> 02:21.000
Or maybe now we have yet another series of confusing brand names where DEX does not mean

02:21.000 --> 02:22.720
what we all think DEX means.

02:22.720 --> 02:23.720
What do you think, Joe?

02:23.720 --> 02:25.680
Well, yeah, this is all because of Chrome OS, isn't it?

02:25.680 --> 02:29.400
And the fact that they've added Android app support into that.

02:29.400 --> 02:33.320
And therefore, people are making these Android apps in a way that actually works in a windowed

02:33.320 --> 02:36.840
environment rather than just full screen touch.

02:36.840 --> 02:42.200
So I'm inclined to agree that they just don't really need to run proper Linux anymore.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.440
But they were kind of targeting developers, weren't they?

02:44.440 --> 02:45.440
I don't know.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.120
I haven't heard any more about that.

02:47.120 --> 02:51.040
Maybe they've quietly dropped it or maybe they're just working on it simultaneously.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.040
That's what I suspect.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.400
And that's why I think it's kind of confusing is I think you're going to have DEX, which

02:55.400 --> 03:01.640
is a windowed Android environment, and you're going to have the DEX dock, which is a docking

03:01.640 --> 03:06.180
station that gives you access to a Linux development environment that co-runs on the phone.

03:06.180 --> 03:08.160
It's very confusing.

03:08.160 --> 03:10.020
And they maybe are for different markets.

03:10.020 --> 03:14.520
The one on the tablet's more for just regular end users that might be considering a laptop

03:14.520 --> 03:16.400
where this sort of solves all that.

03:16.400 --> 03:23.800
Because the price of the Tab S4 is going to be 650 US greenbacks for the Wi-Fi version.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.920
And that's going to be starting August 10th.

03:25.920 --> 03:30.680
They will also be offering an LTE version, but it's more expensive, it's carrier limited,

03:30.680 --> 03:31.680
those kinds of things.

03:31.680 --> 03:35.860
So you think about somebody who's maybe going for the budget purchase here instead of buying

03:35.860 --> 03:43.520
a full-fledged Windows 10 laptop, they go for a Galaxy Tab S4 running Android that now

03:43.520 --> 03:45.120
supports windowed applications.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.900
That might be the market.

03:46.900 --> 03:47.900
It's confusing.

03:47.900 --> 03:52.300
And I am disappointed that it's not full Linux, but I think I can see the market they're shooting

03:52.300 --> 03:53.300
for here.

03:53.300 --> 03:58.180
I don't know why that market wouldn't just buy Chromebooks, but I get the logic of it.

03:58.180 --> 04:03.160
It seems that they're trying to compete with the Surface and the iPad, really.

04:03.160 --> 04:07.760
And they have to have some skin in that game, even if it's not going to be massively successful

04:07.760 --> 04:08.760
for them.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.080
They have to at least have a go.

04:10.080 --> 04:14.240
But you have to ask yourself, how many times are we going to see companies attempt to put

04:14.240 --> 04:19.360
a desktop UI on top of Android and have it not sell very well?

04:19.360 --> 04:21.680
We'll watch them do it right up until the release of Fuchsia.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.240
Yeah, pretty much.

04:23.240 --> 04:29.480
Well, while we're talking about embedded devices, on the other end is all of those home routers.

04:29.480 --> 04:33.740
And our favorite project to make those just a little bit better is OpenWRT.

04:33.740 --> 04:36.840
And they've got a new release, which is a major milestone.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.240
8.06 has come out.

04:38.240 --> 04:43.480
And this is the first release since they merged back with LEAD or LEDE.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.640
And it's been a year in the making.

04:45.640 --> 04:48.300
And there is definitely some results of that year of work.

04:48.300 --> 04:52.880
So depending on your architecture, you're either going to get kernel 4.9 or 4.14, which

04:52.880 --> 04:54.520
is pretty recent.

04:54.520 --> 05:00.400
There's also been nice improvements to the system upgrade procedures and a new auto rollback

05:00.400 --> 05:05.680
functionality to revert the configuration changes when access to the router is lost.

05:05.680 --> 05:12.600
As well, of course, a bunch of other features, security improvements, and WireGuard VPN optimizations.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.880
And WireGuard's something that might well be in the kernel pretty soon.

05:15.880 --> 05:16.880
I hope so.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.160
WireGuard is some good tech.

05:18.160 --> 05:22.380
If you're not familiar, it's a secure network tunnel written from the ground up for Linux.

05:22.380 --> 05:25.400
It's been around for three years of serious development.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.760
It's in deployment at large corporations.

05:27.760 --> 05:32.060
And it's been designed with the primary goal of being both easy to audit by virtue of being

05:32.060 --> 05:36.440
small and highly secure from a cryptography systems and security perspective.

05:36.440 --> 05:39.120
Yeah, it's been an out of tree module for quite a while.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.720
And it's been pretty widely deployed in data centers and whatnot.

05:42.720 --> 05:46.080
So it's no surprise really that this is happening.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.720
But it is definitely good news.

05:47.720 --> 05:48.720
Yeah.

05:48.720 --> 05:53.440
You know, as the very nature of being an out of tree module, it had its own Git repo and

05:53.440 --> 05:54.440
its own mailing list.

05:54.440 --> 05:59.200
So you could really specifically watch the development of WireGuard for a while.

05:59.200 --> 06:06.200
And they've been testing the WireGuard module against every stable Linux kernel since 3.10

06:06.200 --> 06:08.080
on a variety of architectures.

06:08.080 --> 06:11.380
So this is about as baked as it gets before something goes in the kernel.

06:11.380 --> 06:14.080
And that might be why Linus seems to love it so much.

06:14.080 --> 06:18.720
She says on an unrelated note, I see Jason actually made the pull request to have WireGuard

06:18.720 --> 06:19.840
included in the kernel.

06:19.840 --> 06:25.200
And then Linus goes on to say, can I just once again state my love for it and I hope

06:25.200 --> 06:27.220
it gets merged soon?

06:27.220 --> 06:30.880
Maybe the code is imperfect, but I've skimmed it and compared to the horrors that are open

06:30.880 --> 06:32.780
VPN and IPSec.

06:32.780 --> 06:33.780
And it's a work of art.

06:33.780 --> 06:36.080
Yeah, glowing praise from Linus there.

06:36.080 --> 06:38.880
But I didn't think open VPN was that bad.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.520
It's the kind of go to for a lot of people.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.200
You've got to think about it, though, from the kernel perspective.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.080
These are guys that are writing the Linux kernel.

06:47.080 --> 06:52.200
And WireGuard has been created specifically for Linux's kernel, Linux's networking stack

06:52.200 --> 06:53.400
and all of that.

06:53.400 --> 06:58.520
And so open VPN and IPSec, while great, are not purpose built for Linux.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.040
They're a general purpose technology.

07:00.040 --> 07:03.400
They work on the BSDs, they work on the Windows, they work on the Macs.

07:03.400 --> 07:09.880
And so it's not like custom engineered for all of the particulars of Linux's kernel.

07:09.880 --> 07:13.080
And I think when you look at it from that perspective, they just think this is a work

07:13.080 --> 07:16.960
of art because it beautifully plugs in with all the stuff they've been building for years.

07:16.960 --> 07:20.680
And another great thing about WireGuard is the code's been audited by a couple of academic

07:20.680 --> 07:25.280
institutions and those audits are being verified at the moment.

07:25.280 --> 07:31.440
So we pretty much know that it is rock solid.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.440
Last.ting.com.

07:32.440 --> 07:36.960
Ting is smarter than unlimited wireless because if you just use less, you pay less.

07:36.960 --> 07:41.000
The average Ting bill is $23 per phone per month.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.760
It's pay for what you use, a fair price for however much you talk, text and data you use.

07:45.760 --> 07:50.480
But perhaps my favorite part, no contracts nor the termination fees, no quote unquote

07:50.480 --> 07:52.580
service agreements.

07:52.580 --> 07:53.840
And they've got nationwide coverage.

07:53.840 --> 07:59.040
Rest assured, they've got you covered with coast to coast CDMA and GSM coverage.

07:59.040 --> 08:03.180
So whatever better in your area or whatever device that you might have, which also means

08:03.180 --> 08:08.360
if you bring a device to Ting, CDMA or GSM, they'll give you $25 in service credit instead

08:08.360 --> 08:10.280
of taking it off a phone.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.520
And it'll probably pay for more than your first month.

08:12.520 --> 08:13.780
They got a bunch of great devices.

08:13.780 --> 08:16.560
They have a great control panel to manage your wireless account.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.520
I've been using Ting for over four years.

08:18.520 --> 08:24.840
I've also got two Ting Mifis that I have sitting in my RV ready to go whenever we hit the road.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.640
It's $6 a month for each plus Uncle Sam's cut.

08:27.640 --> 08:32.040
It's not a big deal to have that as an available option and then I get two networks worth of

08:32.040 --> 08:33.040
coverage.

08:33.040 --> 08:35.520
It's a super great way to do wireless.

08:35.520 --> 08:36.560
It's smarter than unlimited.

08:36.560 --> 08:38.800
If you use less, you pay less.

08:38.800 --> 08:43.320
Lass.ting.com.

08:43.320 --> 08:46.800
It's been a pretty good week for FOSS projects in terms of donations.

08:46.800 --> 08:51.040
Let's start with elementary OS, they've had a large anonymous donation and that has allowed

08:51.040 --> 08:54.900
Cassidy to go full time with the project joining Daniel there.

08:54.900 --> 08:56.960
So now they've got two full time staffers.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.040
That's got to be good news for them.

08:58.040 --> 09:03.360
Yeah, and Cassidy comes from System76 where I believe he's worked since 2014.

09:03.360 --> 09:09.300
In 2017, he was officially promoted to the UX architect for System76 hardware, software

09:09.300 --> 09:12.660
and tools, and of course, everyone's favorite, Pop OS.

09:12.660 --> 09:16.940
This is a big move and congratulations to Cassidy and he says, the continued support

09:16.940 --> 09:21.360
for our community as well as a large private contribution has given me the opportunity

09:21.360 --> 09:23.520
to go full time and do this as my career.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.560
Now, here's the key part I took away from his blog post, which we'll have linked in

09:26.560 --> 09:27.560
the show notes.

09:27.560 --> 09:33.200
I plan to continue to focus on the areas I've been working on as a volunteer plus dedicate

09:33.200 --> 09:39.240
time to working with OEMs, app developers, and other parties to help keep elementary

09:39.240 --> 09:40.920
financially sustainable.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.880
So there's a lot in this paragraph, so I want to pull out a couple of details.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.360
Let's start with the last one.

09:45.360 --> 09:48.120
Keep elementary financially sustainable.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.080
This is right now at least a one time donation.

09:51.080 --> 09:57.160
So this will give Cassidy about a year's runway, but they will have to come up with other ways

09:57.160 --> 09:59.400
to fund that work after this year.

09:59.400 --> 10:02.880
So that's the financially sustainable part there, and I think that's interesting.

10:02.880 --> 10:06.440
But then this other line in here, dedicate time to working with OEMs.

10:06.440 --> 10:13.020
Well, now that's interesting considering that Cassidy had been at System76 since 2014.

10:13.020 --> 10:18.300
He may have a very good perspective on how to work with OEMs and how a distribution can

10:18.300 --> 10:19.520
work with OEMs.

10:19.520 --> 10:23.440
There's also a bit of talk at the end of this post about continuing their relationship with

10:23.440 --> 10:26.060
System76 just from the other side now.

10:26.060 --> 10:31.960
You take these two elements together, I'm just saying Cassidy could be like an OEM ninja

10:31.960 --> 10:36.320
for elementary OS here and could create some great deals and have really good insights

10:36.320 --> 10:38.640
into how these companies actually function.

10:38.640 --> 10:42.360
Well let's hope so because we've seen a fair few smaller projects struggling financially

10:42.360 --> 10:48.480
lately and there are definitely OEMs out there looking to put destroyers like elementary

10:48.480 --> 10:51.600
on hardware because they've proven to sell pretty well.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.740
Really the name of the week though is handshake.org.

10:54.740 --> 10:58.760
They're a decentralized certificate authority and a peer-to-peer DNS service.

10:58.760 --> 11:04.120
The Gnome Foundation has received $400,000 from them as well as Apache, the EFF and other

11:04.120 --> 11:06.240
projects have received some funds.

11:06.240 --> 11:11.760
And the way the money breaks down for Gnome is $300,000 goes to the project and $100,000

11:11.760 --> 11:12.760
goes to GIMP.

11:12.760 --> 11:17.800
That is massive given there are so few people working on GIMP that's going to be a lot of

11:17.800 --> 11:19.080
money for them.

11:19.080 --> 11:21.320
But what do you make of handshake.org then?

11:21.320 --> 11:26.760
Is this revolutionary or is it just yet another sort of ICO based scam?

11:26.760 --> 11:30.160
I don't know if a scam is the right way to put it, maybe an ICO hopeful.

11:30.160 --> 11:36.440
I mean handshake at least in theory is a great idea, decentralized, permissionless, naming

11:36.440 --> 11:42.020
protocol that's compatible with DNS where every peer is validating and in charge of

11:42.020 --> 11:48.200
managing the root zone with the goal of creating alternatives to existing certificate authorities.

11:48.200 --> 11:51.440
I can tell you that's something the internet desperately needs.

11:51.440 --> 11:55.680
And they're really not trying to replace DNS but to replace the root zone file and the

11:55.680 --> 11:58.260
root servers with this handshake system.

11:58.260 --> 12:02.620
And I think that's a pretty clever idea, I don't know if it's possible but it's clever.

12:02.620 --> 12:06.520
This sounds like ideal TechSnap material to me, maybe you and Wes could go into this in

12:06.520 --> 12:07.520
a bit more depth.

12:07.520 --> 12:08.520
Hmm, perhaps.

12:08.520 --> 12:12.760
Well, let's keep the decentralized train running here because Mozilla would like us all to

12:12.760 --> 12:13.760
talk about the D-Web.

12:13.760 --> 12:19.440
Yeah, the decentralized or distributed web and this is a post on the hacks.mozilla.org

12:19.440 --> 12:23.600
blog and it's a little bit light on content, it's more kind of queuing up what they're

12:23.600 --> 12:26.360
going to be talking about in a series of blog posts.

12:26.360 --> 12:33.520
But it really does raise a lot of the issues that centralization have caused and hopefully

12:33.520 --> 12:39.160
this is going to offer some solutions to that, kind of spotlighting various projects that

12:39.160 --> 12:43.440
are aiming to avoid this centralization problem.

12:43.440 --> 12:47.280
And they're going for the hard kind of centralization, I mean social networking and that kind of

12:47.280 --> 12:51.880
stuff is going to be in this series it sounds like but they also want to try going after

12:51.880 --> 12:58.080
things like the DNS system and also certificate authorities, try to decentralize those aspects

12:58.080 --> 12:59.080
of the web.

12:59.080 --> 13:03.120
So they say in a series of posts they'll introduce projects that cover social communication,

13:03.120 --> 13:10.140
online identity, file sharing, new economic models as well as high level application platforms.

13:10.140 --> 13:15.680
All of this work will either be decentralized or distributed, minimizing or entirely removing

13:15.680 --> 13:17.000
central control.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.120
Now the whole post has more including diagrams about the differences between centralized,

13:22.120 --> 13:25.060
decentralized and distributed so you might want to give it a read if this is an area

13:25.060 --> 13:29.840
that kind of gets you excited, linuxactionnews.com slash 65.

13:29.840 --> 13:34.500
But it's not the only thing that Mozilla have been up to this week, they've also announced

13:34.500 --> 13:40.400
evolving the Firefox brand and talking about how they've got two possibilities for the

13:40.400 --> 13:45.160
visual branding of Firefox and they're not asking people to vote, they're kind of asking

13:45.160 --> 13:50.520
for opinions but they're saying that's not necessarily going to influence their decisions

13:50.520 --> 13:55.840
and they're two quite distinct visual styles and I must say I prefer the second one.

13:55.840 --> 14:00.760
I thought you might, yeah it's much more traditional and I kind of like the first one, they call

14:00.760 --> 14:05.840
them system one and system two and I kind of just like if you're going to change it,

14:05.840 --> 14:10.820
go for something bold but the origins of this whole redesign makes it sound like there may

14:10.820 --> 14:14.640
be some cool projects in the Mozilla Skunkwork labs.

14:14.640 --> 14:19.720
They say a team made up of product and brand designers at Mozilla have begun imagining

14:19.720 --> 14:27.200
a new system to embrace all the Firefox products in the pipeline and those still in the minds

14:27.200 --> 14:30.880
of our emerging technologies group, aka the Skunkworks.

14:30.880 --> 14:34.560
If they want to be modern and hip, they have to kind of design these things and I hate

14:34.560 --> 14:40.360
saying this Joe but it's true with the app icon in mind, what's the icon look on the

14:40.360 --> 14:43.880
phone and the system one design I think is much more distinctive.

14:43.880 --> 14:46.660
Is it distinctive or does it look just like GitLab?

14:46.660 --> 14:49.800
Now I can't unsee that.

14:49.800 --> 14:54.320
I saw them side by side and it was unbelievable how close they were, you think they would

14:54.320 --> 14:55.320
have noticed that.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.240
Dang it Joe, dang it.

14:57.240 --> 15:01.340
Well okay let's talk about the tech side of Firefox for a bit because version 63 is going

15:01.340 --> 15:04.040
to have a great new feature for Linux users.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.720
It will use a bit more RAM though.

15:05.720 --> 15:10.200
Yeah out of process extensions which were available on the other platforms, Windows

15:10.200 --> 15:16.280
and Mac, are finally coming to Linux as the kind of second class citizen but well at least

15:16.280 --> 15:17.280
we're getting them now.

15:17.280 --> 15:21.480
Yeah and this is really the fruits of a process that began three years ago with the move to

15:21.480 --> 15:25.440
web extensions and that's what's making this possible.

15:25.440 --> 15:31.040
The only type of extensions that will be supported by Firefox 63 is web extensions.

15:31.040 --> 15:34.640
The addition of another running process will also increase your memory but the way this

15:34.640 --> 15:40.500
is going to work is these extensions will be out of the main Firefox process and onto

15:40.500 --> 15:41.500
their own.

15:41.500 --> 15:45.000
So if they have some shenanigans, if they have a crash, they do not affect your main

15:45.000 --> 15:46.560
browser thread.

15:46.560 --> 15:50.640
It's similar to why Chrome uses so much memory but Firefox thinks they may have done it a

15:50.640 --> 15:53.240
little more clever and a little slimmer.

15:53.240 --> 15:56.880
Well you mentioned the extra RAM usage and you do have to wonder is this going to mean

15:56.880 --> 16:03.280
extra CPU overhead as well and just generally performance might suffer a little bit but

16:03.280 --> 16:07.720
then performance versus stability, I'm always going to pick stability.

16:07.720 --> 16:12.560
I agree that web browsers become such an essential part of my daily work that making it more

16:12.560 --> 16:14.960
stable is the first priority.

16:14.960 --> 16:18.340
Performance though is much appreciated and that might be where we get long term.

16:18.340 --> 16:22.320
If you think about it, you're kind of getting Firefox down to a core now and that makes

16:22.320 --> 16:28.200
it much easier to improve security and stability over the long term and this work really goes

16:28.200 --> 16:30.560
all the way back to Firefox 49.

16:30.560 --> 16:34.600
It has taken a while for us Linux users to get this but this has been something that

16:34.600 --> 16:40.220
has been done right, it's been well engineered and it's a long term work that isn't even

16:40.220 --> 16:44.400
necessarily done with this stage but this might be one of the most significant stages

16:44.400 --> 16:45.680
of this work.

16:45.680 --> 16:49.200
