00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,560
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,440
This is episode 92, recorded on February 10th, 2019.

3
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,440
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,440
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,440
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:30,200
And I assume you are reporting live on the scene this week from the brand new Raspberry

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,200
Pi IRL store.

8
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,460
Yeah, I should be really, shouldn't I?

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,680
Because it's only about an hour's drive from my place.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,240
But no, I'm afraid I haven't visited this yet.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:44,080
It's in Cambridge, right in the center of town.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:50,280
And yeah, it's an actual bricks and mortar shop where they sell Raspberry Pis and books

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,720
and accessories and everything Raspberry Pi, including the Babbage, their little mascot

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,200
thing, the little cuddly toy.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Well, that's good to know.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:03,040
Yeah, I gotta say, if there's one about an hour from me, I would probably visit.

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:08,040
I like the idea of going in there and plugging a Raspberry Pi into a few accessories, building

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,560
something and then buying a kit, taking it home and building the same thing at home.

19
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,200
That is a neat idea.

20
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,000
I do gotta kind of say, though, it reminds me of the Apple store.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,140
You've got the Raspberry Pi logo out front, lit up like the Apple logo, and then it's

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,480
sort of a white with wood tables kind of look going.

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,520
But at the same time, I would totally visit one if they had one nearby.

24
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah, if parking wasn't such a nightmare in the town center, then I would have probably

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
gone up there by now.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And maybe I will at some point.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,960
But you do have to wonder why they've done this, though, because either they are expecting

29
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,760
to make a lot of money selling this stuff, or they're willing to put a lot of money into

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
it.

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,880
Because retail spaces in this country, well, they always talk about the high street is

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,920
dying, for example.

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,860
It's very, very expensive to run a retail space in this country, and it has to be making

34
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,840
a lot of money, otherwise you don't do it.

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,960
But then again, they have got a lot of money to spend on this, maybe.

36
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
I don't know.

37
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't really understand exactly the motivation for doing it.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,240
Any way you look at it, from like logistics, or money spent hiring, this is a massive investment.

39
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,000
So there must be several really good reasons behind it.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,560
Not just one, but I would bet several.

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,480
Reading their posts and kind of reading between the lines, they say things in here that I

42
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,880
think kind of frame it up for us.

43
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,880
Like here's an example.

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,440
This is a quote from the raspberrypi.org post, which we'll have linked in the show notes.

45
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,720
They write, explore some of the things you can do with a pie.

46
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,760
Discover our accessories and books, and get your hands on store-only exclusives.

47
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,760
Discover what you can do with a Raspberry Pi.

48
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,520
That I think is a key sentence right there.

49
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,060
Come explore some of these different opportunities.

50
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,640
And I think what they're trying to say is, average people, you know, a mom that walks

51
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,680
in with her son, or a dad that walks in with his daughter, can connect things up and build

52
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,520
something and learn about something that if they weren't following tech circles online,

53
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,680
they would otherwise be unaware of.

54
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,600
I think that's the plan here.

55
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,560
And they must see this as a big opportunity to make an investment like this.

56
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,120
It feels like you'd need to have a lot of these shops everywhere for it to be a huge

57
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
success.

58
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,920
But I suppose they have to start from somewhere.

59
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,960
And maybe they will gauge the success of this one.

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:37,200
And if it does turn a profit for them, then maybe they will expand into other cities around

61
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
the UK.

62
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,280
And maybe they'll end up with this even bigger empire than they've already got.

63
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,680
I'd love to see more of these stores.

64
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,440
At the same time, I don't want to see the foundation's focus drift too far from the

65
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,440
core mission.

66
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,140
I'll give you a clear line for me.

67
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,760
If they could launch three more stores, maybe one could even be like in the Seattle area

68
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,800
or something like that.

69
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:05,320
But it meant no Raspberry Pi 4 until 2021, I would definitely opt for the new Raspberry

70
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
Pi 4.

71
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,360
I want to have that sooner and have the foundation's focus there than on opening retail stores.

72
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,340
That said, perhaps they can chew gum and walk at the same time.

73
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,800
And I hope so because I'd love to see a few more of these.

74
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,160
The idea would be way more powerful if they had a bigger presence.

75
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,400
Well, one thing they're not going to have to worry about is cashing up at the end of

76
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,520
the day because they're not going to take any cash.

77
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,320
It's card only.

78
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,320
Very modern.

79
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,360
And I don't know how I feel about that really makes me feel like an old man.

80
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,680
You only pay cash for stuff?

81
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,320
Well, I'm not quite as bad a storeman, but I carry a bit of cash with me in just in case

82
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,320
things go wrong.

83
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,400
I remember there was a big outage maybe last year and I was at the supermarket and no one

84
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
could pay for anything.

85
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,200
And the cash machine, the ATM outside was empty.

86
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,240
Obviously that happened within an hour or so.

87
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,760
And everyone else was just not able to buy their stuff.

88
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,200
But because I had a little bit of cash, I was able to buy the essentials and not rely

89
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
on my card.

90
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,680
So it's just a bit of a weird future for me where, you know, we moved to this cashless

91
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
society.

92
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,240
I mean, I do use my card most of the time, but it's just handy to have a little bit of

93
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
cash there, I find.

94
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:17,580
Joe, can I tell you about the good word around Bitcoin and just take a moment to tell you

95
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,760
about the power of the blockchain?

96
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
No, I kid.

97
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,760
I do actually follow.

98
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,960
In fact, I'd be a little sad if we went to an all electronic payments for everything

99
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,360
society.

100
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,880
That said, I also prefer to pay with my phone because I always forget my wallet, but I never

101
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,200
forget my phone.

102
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,200
And so just the pragmatist in me finds it appealing.

103
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,340
I just wish we could have like a perfect world where it was a totally open source stack,

104
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,320
like something that was maybe blockchain based.

105
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,480
But that's not 2019.

106
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
That's not happening now.

107
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,480
And I think the Raspberry Pi folks are pretty clever in this because you save on a bunch

108
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,720
of security issues holding cash on site.

109
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,280
And for the things people are buying, that crowd probably has a form of electronic payment,

110
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,920
be it a debit card, a credit card or even phone.

111
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
Oh, yeah, definitely.

112
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,480
I mean, the overhead, I mean, it costs money to pay cash into the bank.

113
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,120
You've got to count it and it's easy for staff to steal it and stuff.

114
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,360
If it's all just contactless payments and card payments, it's just much easier.

115
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,280
So I totally understand why they do it, but I don't know.

116
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,280
It does.

117
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,880
It just makes me feel old, man.

118
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,880
What can I say?

119
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,200
Well, you might feel old, so let's talk about old school stuff for a moment.

120
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,840
OpenOffice, I don't think we've ever mentioned it on the show before, but this week, LibreOffice

121
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,520
and OpenOffice are vulnerable to the same bug.

122
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:41,840
Only one of them has been patched and spoiler alert, it's not OpenOffice.

123
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,200
Yeah, the fix came in very quickly for LibreOffice, so that has filtered down to the distros now.

124
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,400
So there's very little chance that you're going to be vulnerable.

125
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,520
And to be fair, the OpenOffice bug isn't quite as exploitable and potentially not as serious,

126
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,960
but it does go to show that you should not be using OpenOffice.

127
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,600
Now, I wouldn't imagine anybody listening to this is still using it, but I do often

128
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,720
come across people who are still using OpenOffice because that was such a big brand.

129
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,080
It was considered the free, as in beer, alternative to Microsoft Office for so long, and it's

130
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,080
still around.

131
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,960
You can still go and download and install it on Windows or Mac OS or whatever.

132
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:28,020
And so a lot of people are still using it, and it's not being properly maintained.

133
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,160
So I don't know what we do to get everyone to realize that they should move over to LibreOffice

134
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,640
because that OpenOffice brand is so strong.

135
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,680
This is why I have always stuck with StarOffice.

136
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,700
No, I joke, but I do follow what you're saying, and I think there's no helping these people.

137
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,640
These are the same people that are on Internet Explorer 6 and whatnot.

138
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,360
I don't mean to be disparaging if you're one of them listening to the show.

139
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,440
Maybe your corporate environment or educational environment mandates OpenOffice.

140
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,620
If it is, email me, and I will advocate on your behalf.

141
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,880
Let me know, chris at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

142
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,320
But the reason why this has some momentum behind it is the Australian researcher that

143
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:13,220
reported the vulnerability on Friday also included some proof of concept exploit code

144
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,240
in his overall report.

145
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,760
And the chief vulnerability exploited is a path traversal flaw that allowed the attack

146
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,880
code to move out of its current directory and then jump into the one that contained

147
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,560
sample Python scripts for LibreOffice or OpenOffice, depending on what you were using.

148
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:36,040
And once in there, they could use another vulnerability to take over the machine.

149
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,800
And essentially, the user had very minimal interaction to trigger this, which is really

150
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
the concern.

151
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,620
Now, like Joe said, LibreOffice developers were all over it.

152
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,680
They fixed this in version 6.1.4.2 and 6.0.7.

153
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,040
And of course, in version 6.2, which has just come out as a feature release.

154
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,120
With that major new headline, the brand new notebook bar, which is a new, as they say,

155
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,840
radical approach to the user interface.

156
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,440
And it provides different options for how you might like the toolbar laid out from

157
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,100
the traditional standards kind of style to a sort of a tabbed browser look to something

158
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:19,080
that is somewhat familiar to the Microsoft ribbon, which they call grouped.

159
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,600
I actually like that one the most trying them all out myself.

160
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,600
And it's not bad, Joe.

161
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,080
I hate to be the one here to get a little hype on the LibreOffice because usually I'm

162
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,280
the one that downplays the LibreOffice stories traditionally because it's kind of boring.

163
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,680
It's great software, but it's kind of boring.

164
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,000
Having used it for the weekend, I might just do all of my writing now in LibreOffice Writer.

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's pretty good.

166
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,440
Well, I installed it on Ubuntu by just downloading the tar file with all of the devs and just

167
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:55,720
doing the dpkg install star.deb, and I was quite surprised that it just worked perfectly.

168
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,840
And when I opened it, I thought, well, hang on, isn't there supposed to be something different

169
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,840
about this?

170
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,840
And then I actually went and read the post and, oh, you have to enable it, which I think

171
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,320
is a good move at this stage.

172
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,280
Don't just shock people with a new UI.

173
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,120
Make it trivial for them to turn it on and off.

174
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,240
But if you don't want this, then it's not going to be a problem for you, at least for

175
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,520
now because nothing has changed by default.

176
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,520
I agree.

177
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,680
Having these new toolbars off by default, I think it was a pretty good move because

178
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,440
they don't feel 100% baked to me.

179
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,100
None of them have really clicked.

180
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,260
They all have kind of like small little issues.

181
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:37,400
Everything but the standard toolbar has essentially a hamburger menu, but they don't call it that

182
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,000
and they don't use the hamburger menu icon.

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,720
It's just like a little down arrow or in some cases it says menu.

184
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,660
And in different layouts, there's different stuff in that menu and there's different areas

185
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,440
you go to even change the layout depending on which layout you use.

186
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:59,080
There's just stuff in there that it's not 100% done, but it's like 90, 95% done.

187
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,360
And so I think leaving it off by default, but letting people opt into it, try it out

188
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,600
and give feedback and then another release cycle or two, then they can pick one and stick

189
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
to it.

190
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,440
But this is all about making the transition from proprietary office suites easier.

191
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,640
Now I must admit, I haven't used Microsoft Office for years.

192
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,080
I've used Google Docs extensively and I've used LibreOffice, so I'm not really in a great

193
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,360
position to compare.

194
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,640
Have you used Microsoft Office enough to know whether this will aid the transition?

195
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,240
Oh for sure, yeah, absolutely.

196
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,440
Especially for those that are coming from the standard desktop versions of Microsoft

197
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,320
Office and don't want to necessarily make a leap to a subscription cloud version or

198
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,400
just tired of paying the upgrade license cycle.

199
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:50,820
And one of the important things about this release is they have greatly improved interoperability

200
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,880
with proprietary file formats once again.

201
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,140
I mean they do this every release, but just like all those previous releases, they've

202
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,080
done a lot more work again.

203
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,960
And one of the things I think is great about LibreOffice is they've specifically put work

204
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:09,520
into supporting old Microsoft formats that Microsoft is no longer supporting.

205
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,920
Which if you think about it, long term, that's the real strength of an open source project

206
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
like this.

207
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,640
They can just for years work on improving that compatibility after Microsoft leaves

208
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,200
those users way behind.

209
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,640
Yeah, which is a very serious problem.

210
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:28,160
A few years ago I dug out an old computer that my dad had done some writing on and that

211
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,600
had a SCSI hard drive in it.

212
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,700
That tells you how old that was.

213
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:37,000
And managed to hook it up and I can't remember exactly how I managed to read the Clarisse

214
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,440
Works docs that were on there, but I managed to convert them and I've got them I think

215
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
in ODT now.

216
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,280
And that is a prime example of data that is just locked up in this proprietary format

217
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,900
that you otherwise can't access.

218
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,720
And yeah, as you say, the beauty of an open source project is that they can do up resources

219
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:04,720
to this and potentially keep that data alive and valuable for a lot longer than a company

220
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,160
like Microsoft would.

221
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,840
This release gave me an opportunity to look at LibreOffice in a new light.

222
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:16,020
When you combine their new look that they have and the fact that I run so many stinking

223
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,560
Electron apps now that my bar has just shifted.

224
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:26,720
LibreOffice is like a lightweight efficient app with tons of features compared to my Electron

225
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
apps.

226
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,640
And in the past when I used LibreOffice it was like this huge application that took all

227
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:37,520
of this memory and that all now has completely shifted when I look at how much RAM these

228
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,120
Electron editors take.

229
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,440
And so I'm sitting here using a native Linux application with a great spell checker, incredible

230
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:50,440
file format compatibility, a great editor and a new modern look on the UI.

231
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:55,060
And I'm just left a little disappointed and a little frustrated that the project isn't

232
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,720
treating Linux users better.

233
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,960
And I appreciate that they probably have exponentially more users on Windows and a lot more users

234
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,440
on Mac OS.

235
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,660
But throw us a bone that there's so many ways you could do a better job at packaging for

236
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:15,000
Linux that it's ridiculous you're not stepping up at least in one avenue.

237
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,440
Now the folks over at Flathub have you covered.

238
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:25,360
You can get the brand new latest version of LibreOffice 6.2.03 that they have, the Flathub

239
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,960
maintainers have packaged up on behalf of LibreOffice.

240
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,760
Or you can go get a snap that the snap maintainers, the snap craft folks are packaging up on behalf

241
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,040
of LibreOffice.

242
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,900
But if you want to install it on your own Linux box like Joe mentioned, you got to download

243
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:47,020
a tar file that extracts out into several directories with some archaic install script

244
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,720
or a directory full of RPMs or devs depending on which distribution you choose.

245
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
And good luck.

246
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Good luck.

247
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
You know what?

248
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Let's do it.

249
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,440
Because for some of us, it works just fine.

250
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,400
And for others, it breaks like hell.

251
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,240
You end up having multiple icons on your system.

252
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,400
I installed this on an Ubuntu system and a Fedora system.

253
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,540
And I got different results both times.

254
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,260
And I can't help but think they could do a much better job.

255
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,720
They can make an app image.

256
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,680
They could maintain a Flatpak themselves.

257
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,320
And they have Flatpak documentation on their website.

258
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,920
And it's embarrassingly out of date.

259
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,560
There's no excuse for it.

260
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,480
I appreciate that they have more Windows users.

261
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,840
But the reality is, they may have one of the most competitive editors on Linux right now.

262
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,200
Man, if they put Markdown support into this thing, it'd be next level.

263
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,880
In fact, if anybody in the audience knows how to get Markdown support in LibreOffice

264
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,000
at Chris Ellis, me on Twitter, I'd love to know.

265
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,040
I mean, really, it's close there.

266
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,840
Because comparing it to all of the other heavy editors now, it's got a lot of competitive

267
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,080
options, especially when you add the new file compatibility stuff.

268
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,400
I would just love to see them be a little more competitive on how it gets distributed.

269
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,480
And a big tip of the hat and thank you to the Flathub maintainers and to the staff at

270
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,160
Canonical that are packaging up and staffing Flatpaks for those of us that want to try

271
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,680
this on our system without breaking it by installing 15 different RPMs.

272
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,320
The Snap's still on the 6.1 branch at the moment, but I would imagine that that will

273
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,880
get updated this week.

274
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,680
Well, that's the problem when somebody has to volunteer their time to package it.

275
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,800
If LibreOffice was snapping it up directly themselves, then we wouldn't have this problem.

276
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,080
And that's why I say thank you to the folks at Canonical, they're doing it because we

277
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
wouldn't have it otherwise.

278
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,360
Yeah, although a lot of people won't actually use 6.2 for quite a while until it turns up

279
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,960
in their distro's repos.

280
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,720
I won't be using it day to day because I don't really need those features right now.

281
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,800
And maybe when I upgrade to 20.04, it'll be in there.

282
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,400
So I think that it's more relevant on the Windows side, really.

283
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Right.

284
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
I agree.

285
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,800
I mean, most users will just get it when their distribution refreshes.

286
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,880
However, if you took a lifelong Mac user or Windows user and told them that they weren't

287
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,220
going to get the next version of their Office suite until they upgraded their operating

288
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,720
system, they would laugh in your face.

289
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,720
So while I agree it works, and from a practical standpoint, it's perfectly functional, but

290
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,320
it really feels out of date.

291
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,680
In a modern marketplace, it just seems super antiquated.

292
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,040
Well, it's almost as antiquated as the Android security situation.

293
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Everything's fine unless you view a PNG.

294
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,440
I mean, what's the big deal?

295
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,400
You just innocently view a PNG on your device and you get owned.

296
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
Why is that a problem?

297
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,680
Well, it's a problem because almost no one is actually going to get a patch for this.

298
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,480
Well, maybe that's harsh, but a lot of devices out there will never be patched against this

299
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
vulnerability.

300
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,640
The way you'll know you're secure is if it says you have the February 2019 patches.

301
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,880
If you don't have that, then you kind of have a problem because the most serious of what

302
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,400
are several vulnerabilities that got patched is this PNG vulnerability where you're just

303
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,200
viewing a PNG image, like in an email, on a webpage, in a chat app, whatever it is,

304
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,000
you can actually have malicious code smuggled in that PNG image and the viewer on Android,

305
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
if it's using the system viewer, will render it.

306
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,160
So not all applications, but many of them.

307
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,840
A few other holes in there, one of them involving Bluetooth signal handling, which even just

308
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,560
a malicious Bluetooth signal can own your rig.

309
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,280
But I think out of everything in this list, that PNG one is definitely the worst.

310
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,080
The ping file, I guess some people call it a ping file, Joe.

311
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,240
I have never called it that.

312
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,840
I've heard it called that, but it's a PNG.

313
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
Thank you very much.

314
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
Thank you.

315
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,880
Now, I was all set to be smug about this with lineage running on my phone and I've been

316
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,880
doing the daily updates.

317
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,440
I normally do them every week or so, but I've been doing them every day to try and get up

318
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,800
to the February patch level and no, I did it today and still 5th of January, 2019.

319
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,020
So I am still vulnerable.

320
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,240
So even lineage on a OnePlus 3T is vulnerable.

321
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,240
Yeah, but as we record, we're only 10 days into the month, so I'm sure pretty soon you'll

322
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
have it, Joe.

323
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,200
And you know, it's not all doom and gloom because there's ASLR built into Android, which

324
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,620
will sort a lot of exploits like this.

325
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,700
So there is mitigation technologies and I don't see any reports in the wild yet.

326
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,600
So there is time for the patches to land.

327
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,760
Yeah, but it does potentially impact at least half of all Android devices that are still

328
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:22,120
active and maybe even more than that because it may go far back beyond Android 7.

329
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,220
It could go several versions beyond that.

330
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,220
We just don't know.

331
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,320
There's not much information about this specifically from Google at the moment, which is a bit

332
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,840
of a shame really.

333
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:36,840
It'd be nice to have some clarity on exactly what is vulnerable, but I suppose it pretty

334
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,160
much goes without saying that if you've got an old version of Android that isn't being

335
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,080
patched, then you're going to be vulnerable to a lot more than just this.

336
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,920
Yeah, that is so often sort of the ending note for a story like this and it really drives

337
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,520
me crazy.

338
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,300
I feel like this is a much, much bigger problem than it gets recognition for.

339
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,420
So anybody on Android 5, for example, which is still a very, very popular version of Android,

340
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,760
you're not getting a patch.

341
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:09,100
And if you have a Qualcomm chip in your Android device, there's 19 security screw-ups in this

342
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:15,140
February patch alone that fix driver issues for Qualcomm chipsets.

343
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,760
If you're not getting these patches and you have a Qualcomm chip, you're vulnerable.

344
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,920
And that's just the hard math of it and it drives me crazy that this still is allowed

345
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:30,400
to exist, that they have this slow solution, Project Treble, and encouraging the Linux

346
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,020
community to have much longer support windows for the kernels and it's a very, very, very

347
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,020
slow burn.

348
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,720
And when you look at how long it takes this stuff to roll out to Android, it makes this

349
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,840
next story sort of anticlimactic because what we're about to talk about won't even land

350
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:50,040
until Linux 5.0 and who knows how long that'll take to get out to Android handsets.

351
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:57,680
Yeah, this is Adiantum, which is encryption for low-end Android Go devices as essentially

352
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,280
an alternative to spec, which we talked about towards the end of last year, which was the

353
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,120
one that originally came from the NSA and didn't hang around in the kernel for very

354
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,120
long.

355
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
Right.

356
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,220
Spec was pulled from the Linux kernel in 4.20 just simply because nobody wanted to step

357
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,220
up to maintain it.

358
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,080
That didn't make it very long.

359
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,680
So I think this is actually, in a sense, not like the true meaning of the word, but in

360
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,580
a sense, it's more competing with AES.

361
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,240
Android offers storage encryption using advanced encryption standard, which is AES.

362
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:35,360
Most new Android devices have hardware support for AES via the ARM version 8 cryptography

363
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,360
extension, which means accelerated hardware decryption for AES.

364
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,520
That's most Android devices, but not all, like the Android Go devices, which are in

365
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,640
developing countries, and Android Wear devices, and all the other kind of random devices that

366
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,560
Android happens to run on that still need data protection but don't have hardware-accelerated

367
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,560
AES decryption.

368
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,240
Now, my first thought was, hmm, what about performance?

369
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,040
Because with my Nexus 9, I had to disable encryption because it was just useless with

370
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,440
encryption enabled.

371
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,880
So that was my biggest concern, but it looks like this will be fairly efficient.

372
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,440
But there will still be a bit of a performance hit, which does matter on these low-end devices.

373
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,320
The performance thing they're pulling off here is particularly neat, and it has to do

374
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,760
with block sizes, and how they're doing the encryption, and how they stream that to the

375
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,440
decryption system, and all of that, which we all have linked to the show notes.

376
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
But a couple of things to note about this.

377
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,000
Number one, one of the core goals behind the project was to find a way to encrypt file

378
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,280
system data on low-end devices, and then be able to decrypt it very quickly without annoying

379
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,920
the end user, or, very importantly, negatively impacting the battery.

380
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,640
So that was their benchmark.

381
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,120
But the other thing to note is this isn't limited just to Android.

382
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,280
It's going to be mainlined in 5.0, so it will be available via DMCrypt, and it'll be on

383
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,280
Linux systems.

384
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,440
It'll be an option for Linux users to secure their file system.

385
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,080
Yeah, so it sounds good in theory, but I think I would have to see it in action, and almost

386
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,560
compare side by side to see whether or not there is that performance and battery, as

387
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
you say, impact.

388
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,280
Hopefully, they've got it sussed.

389
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,280
I agree.

390
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,120
Whenever you're messing with your data, you have to be very careful.

391
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,480
Not only do you need to have backups, but you need to do your own measures.

392
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,000
Measure twice, cut once on this kind of stuff.

393
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,880
But it is worth noting that it's not a new encryption algorithm as such.

394
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,520
Instead, it's a repackaging of the cha-cha stream cipher that makes it useful for disk

395
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
encryption.

396
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:44,120
So we're dealing with repackaging existing technologies here, and this whole system was

397
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:50,120
in development before spec was even proposed as a faster-to-deploy solution.

398
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,320
So it's been in the works for longer than it may seem.

399
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:59,600
Naturally, though, development did hit a faster pace when spec didn't really work out.

400
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,840
The developers realized where that was going, like, this is our chance.

401
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,640
But they've been working on this for a long time, and it's not a new fundamental encryption

402
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,740
system they're using here.

403
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,880
It's just a repackaging of existing, safe encryption standards.

404
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,760
Yeah, well, the first rule of crypto is don't roll your own crypto.

405
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,760
Telegram.

406
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,940
Yeah, use existing technologies, ideally open-source ones, so that gets a thumbs up straight away.

407
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,160
Our last story for the day brings a big smile to my face, because long-time Linux users

408
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:34,280
know that whenever a new advanced fancy-pants video codec was in the works, there's a few

409
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,120
things about it that were immediately turned off for Linux users.

410
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,180
It usually incorporated some kind of crazy DRM, it was patented like crazy, and it wasn't

411
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,320
available to Linux users.

412
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,580
And us Linux users would just sit back and go, yeah, yeah, have your crazy great video

413
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,040
codecs.

414
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:53,080
That, Joe, is no longer true.

415
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,520
In fact, things have really shifted in video codecs and audio codecs over the years.

416
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,640
For those of you that don't know, a lot of the patents and encumbranments around MP3

417
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,740
have finally, finally faded away.

418
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,640
But we still have all these issues around H.264, the most common video codec on the

419
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
web.

420
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,440
But Intel is hoping to encourage the adoption of a future codec that is royalty-free.

421
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:26,080
Yeah, AoMedia Video 1, or AV1 for short, which has been gaining quite a lot of momentum recently.

422
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:32,320
And there's a great talk on YouTube from linuxconf.au, which we can link in the show notes, from Timothy

423
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:39,680
B. Terabury, I think you say his name, explaining just why AV1 is a great codec, apart from

424
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,120
being royalty-free.

425
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,120
But even technically, it's just a next-generation codec.

426
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,200
It's a very in-depth talk, but it's well worth watching.

427
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,120
But one of the problems that they had up until recently is that although decoding was very

428
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,320
quick, the actual encoding of the video in the first place was fairly slow.

429
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:06,560
And what Intel have done now is released, as open source, SVT AV1, which is their CPU-based

430
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,120
encoding software tool.

431
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,560
Let's make sure we understand what we're talking about hardware here.

432
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,800
We're talking about hardware here.

433
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:18,060
You're gonna need a Skylight generation or newer Xeon processor with at least 112 threads

434
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:24,960
that has at least 48 gigabytes of RAM if you want to do 10-bit color space 4K video encoding.

435
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,600
Requirements go down from there.

436
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,560
But when you hear about how Linux is used in video production, imagine yourself a room

437
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:37,260
full of rack-mount Linux boxes with tons of CPUs in them and RAM that are encoding videos

438
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,600
like this for Hollywood studio machines.

439
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,480
This is where Linux excels in video production, is when you need a ton of horsepower, you

440
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:47,400
need to send your video job into something to really chew through it, you just can't

441
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,160
beat the economics of Linux.

442
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,360
But even as a publisher, on a much smaller scale than that, it is nice to know that there's

443
00:26:53,360 --> 00:27:00,240
this royalty-free codec that can be baked into open source software.

444
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,120
And although it's early days at the moment, it'd be nice to see a lot of sites supporting

445
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,040
this and just pushing it forward.

446
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:11,120
And I think that Intel's move here might make that a reality sooner rather than later.

447
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,200
Well, the support is looking really good on the playback side, Chrome, Firefox, all those

448
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,880
current versions have support, MPV, VLC, they have support, FFmpeg nightlies have support,

449
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,280
so it's going to be coming to Handbrake very soon.

450
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:28,160
But this is all kind of CPU-based now.

451
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,000
But about a year from now, Intel says we're going to be seeing actual hardware encoders

452
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,240
that can churn out video in the AV1 codec much, much faster.

453
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,880
So this isn't a long-term solution, this is like for people that want to deal with high-resolution

454
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,860
video right now and distribute it at incredibly small file sizes.

455
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,360
This is something you can do, but in about a year, it could be baked into chips for a

456
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
lot of us.

457
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:56,420
Yeah, and anything that gets us away from patents and royalties and all of that horrible

458
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:02,040
mess has got to be good, so I'm really hoping that this works out as a new industry standard.

459
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Yeah, really, H.264 has been great, and X.264, technically amazing.

460
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,240
Blackmagic, having worked in video for many years, I am so impressed.

461
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,880
I'm also ready to move on.

462
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,600
AV1 looks even better, it's royalty-free, it's just going to be a process.

463
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,440
Early support is there, but we just have to wait and see where this goes.

464
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,880
And if something interesting develops with this or any story in Linux or the open-source

465
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,560
world, we'll cover it.

468
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:43,580
And if you're well-networked in the open-source world, Linux Academy is hiring an instructor

469
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:50,680
recruiter to help us grow the training architect team here from around 30 people to 100 people.

470
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,560
Our students have high expectations and they want to add a ton of more content and need

471
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:58,560
to hire a lot more people, but we need somebody that can put us in touch with great people.
