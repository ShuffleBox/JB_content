00:00.000 --> 00:09.520
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 136, recorded on December 15th, 2019.

00:09.520 --> 00:10.520
I'm Chris.

00:10.520 --> 00:11.520
And I'm Joe.

00:11.520 --> 00:12.520
Hello, Joe.

00:12.520 --> 00:16.680
Good to be connected with you over Microsoft Teams this, okay, not really, but we do start

00:16.680 --> 00:19.240
out with a big announcement from Microsoft this week.

00:19.240 --> 00:22.760
Yes, Microsoft Teams is available on Linux.

00:22.760 --> 00:27.120
There's a deb file in an RPM, and I'm sure everyone rushed out to install it straight

00:27.120 --> 00:28.120
away.

00:28.120 --> 00:33.160
We obviously need another chat client for Linux, clearly, but joking aside, this is

00:33.160 --> 00:40.880
still kind of a big deal, simply as it seems to be the first official Office 365 application

00:40.880 --> 00:42.240
for Linux.

00:42.240 --> 00:46.640
In a way, this had to be the first one because all of the other applications will sort of

00:46.640 --> 00:47.940
wrap into this.

00:47.940 --> 00:51.680
And I say other applications because Microsoft themselves is directly hinting that this is

00:51.680 --> 00:56.480
the beginning of Office 365 coming for Linux.

00:56.480 --> 01:02.960
If we have an episode where we're announcing Word is available for Linux, or Excel is available

01:02.960 --> 01:07.560
for Linux, even if it's an Electron app, I'm having a shot on the show or something.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.380
We have to celebrate that.

01:09.380 --> 01:12.360
That would be mind-blowing to previous past Chris.

01:12.360 --> 01:14.920
Yeah, and past most people, really.

01:14.920 --> 01:20.920
They do say Microsoft Teams client is the first Microsoft 365 app that's coming to Linux

01:20.920 --> 01:21.920
desktops.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.440
So, that heavily implies that you're right.

01:24.440 --> 01:27.440
The rest of them will be coming, presumably, in 2020.

01:27.440 --> 01:30.680
The other thing that they make pretty clear in this post, which we'll have linked in the

01:30.680 --> 01:38.560
show notes at linuxactionnews.com, this is something that their customers asked for.

01:38.560 --> 01:44.540
This is in response to customer demand, which I think we should just let that have a moment.

01:44.540 --> 01:45.540
That's really impressive.

01:45.540 --> 01:51.160
They have a quote on here from Jimmy Beckman, who is in charge of personal products for

01:51.160 --> 01:59.580
Volvo, he writes, quote, at Volvo Cars, Linux is being used by many users in several departments.

01:59.580 --> 02:04.500
Until now, our Linux users have largely been stuck on a collaboration island with different

02:04.500 --> 02:09.440
unofficial and unsupported clients for Skype business, and more recently, Microsoft Teams.

02:09.440 --> 02:14.880
But with Teams for Linux from Microsoft, we have been able to leave that island and collaborate

02:14.880 --> 02:20.080
across our different platforms with full functionality with a rich client.

02:20.080 --> 02:23.680
That's amazing and they say that this is a huge improvement for them because number one,

02:23.680 --> 02:30.180
they can now do reliable screen sharing with other members of Volvo from their Linux desktops.

02:30.180 --> 02:34.440
There are six things I like about that statement.

02:34.440 --> 02:41.060
And number one, with a bullet on that list is, it blows my mind that it is now Microsoft

02:41.060 --> 02:47.200
software that is making it possible for those Linux users in different companies to actually

02:47.200 --> 02:49.120
run the Linux desktop.

02:49.120 --> 02:53.240
In my day, that was the current I was constantly fighting.

02:53.240 --> 02:57.980
I was trying to solve exchange and word compatibility constantly.

02:57.980 --> 03:02.600
And now it's Microsoft software with Visual Studio Code, which is the one that came to

03:02.600 --> 03:07.400
mind first, and now things like Teams that is making it possible for people to choose

03:07.400 --> 03:08.400
to run Linux.

03:08.400 --> 03:09.400
Wow, Joe.

03:09.400 --> 03:13.120
I mean, that just really, that's number one on my list.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.160
There's five others.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.600
It's not a huge surprise to me.

03:16.600 --> 03:21.640
If you really think about the long term trend, it kind of almost goes back to Apple giving

03:21.640 --> 03:26.480
away the macOS updates for free and setting that precedent that operating systems are

03:26.480 --> 03:28.600
free of cost.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.900
And so Microsoft had to follow suit with that.

03:31.900 --> 03:35.520
And they don't really care what operating system you're using now as long as you're

03:35.520 --> 03:41.800
connecting to their services and paying for 365 and developers are paying for Azure.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.960
What does it matter to them whether using Windows 10 or Ubuntu?

03:44.960 --> 03:45.960
I absolutely agree.

03:45.960 --> 03:50.840
I might argue that the pressure from free and open source software operating systems

03:50.840 --> 03:53.000
sort of forced Apple's hand and Microsoft's hand.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
But you're right.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.360
As far as commercial OS's go, I kind of follow what you're saying there.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.840
It's all about the services.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.480
All roads lead to Azure, et cetera, et cetera.

04:03.480 --> 04:07.620
However, there is a practical difference when you start combining all of it.

04:07.620 --> 04:10.640
When you look at.NET Core, when you look at PowerShell for Linux, when you look at

04:10.640 --> 04:16.760
Visual Studio Code and now Teams, there is a suite of software that is maintained by

04:16.760 --> 04:20.800
Microsoft that makes it possible to run Linux desktop.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.880
And I mentioned Visual Studio Code specifically because that's something that I, in the last

04:24.880 --> 04:30.560
three months, have started using pretty seriously and just think it's a really fantastic editor.

04:30.560 --> 04:35.460
And just last week, because I've kind of been doing it in baby steps, I learned that it

04:35.460 --> 04:39.640
allows me to edit my system files and it will prompt for my pseudo password so I don't have

04:39.640 --> 04:42.240
to run code as root.

04:42.240 --> 04:47.240
Man, it's just, it feels like a first class editor on Linux.

04:47.240 --> 04:51.840
And I was thinking like if I were ever to leave Linux and switch to a Mac OS desktop

04:51.840 --> 04:57.760
or like a Windows 10 desktop of some future iteration, I would still take Visual Studio

04:57.760 --> 04:58.760
Code with me.

04:58.760 --> 05:00.160
I would still take Vivaldi with me.

05:00.160 --> 05:05.520
I would take a couple of these key applications and I could see others that would take other

05:05.520 --> 05:08.560
applications they make like PowerShell and.NET Core, et cetera.

05:08.560 --> 05:13.800
It really is a, it's a new era where all of these things are kind of coming together and

05:13.800 --> 05:18.040
they're making a real actual measurable contribution.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.760
And I mean, I just can't even believe these words about come out of my mouth.

05:21.760 --> 05:26.040
I think my Linux desktop is better thanks to software made by Microsoft today.

05:26.040 --> 05:27.040
Wow.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.040
I know.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.080
Hate mail to Chris, please, not me.

05:30.080 --> 05:34.120
Alan at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

05:34.120 --> 05:37.320
I know it's crazy to my brain, but it's true.

05:37.320 --> 05:42.280
I really have found Visual Studio Code as I've gotten into Docker and editing YAML files

05:42.280 --> 05:45.480
and it's marked down support, it's just a great app.

05:45.480 --> 05:50.600
We talked last week about Ubuntu Pro for AWS and how a big part of that was the compliance

05:50.600 --> 05:51.600
story.

05:51.600 --> 05:56.280
Well, again, compliance is at the heart of this, I think.

05:56.280 --> 06:01.160
If your organization says that you have to use Microsoft Teams to be compliant, which

06:01.160 --> 06:06.400
is the reality for a lot of enterprises, and you have to use Edge, the browser, we're getting

06:06.400 --> 06:09.520
close to a point where you can do that on Linux.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.120
And that, I think, is the real key here.

06:12.120 --> 06:16.520
If you're going to deploy Linux at scale in the enterprise on the desktop, you need to

06:16.520 --> 06:19.880
have that compliance story straight.

06:19.880 --> 06:25.040
Or even if it's not at scale, Joe, I mean, even if it's just 20, 15, 30 people, they're

06:25.040 --> 06:26.680
now able to fully collaborate.

06:26.680 --> 06:27.880
Yeah, true.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.640
So this is good news.

06:29.640 --> 06:33.720
Even if you're not going to use Teams, which I'm not going to, I have no interest in using

06:33.720 --> 06:39.800
Office 365, quite frankly, but it is going to benefit all of us because it will ultimately

06:39.800 --> 06:43.000
mean more users of the Linux desktop.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Yeah.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.520
I got an email from a listener who works at Microsoft, and he runs Linux all day, every

06:49.520 --> 06:50.520
day.

06:50.520 --> 06:53.700
And he said, you know, I've been testing this for a while, and let me tell you, just here

06:53.700 --> 06:57.680
at Microsoft, this is going to make a big difference in my day-to-day job.

06:57.680 --> 07:03.240
And I haven't asked him specifically, but I've got the impression that there is more

07:03.240 --> 07:09.120
than a handful of people that are running Linux full-time at Microsoft.

07:09.120 --> 07:15.160
The individual I was speaking to is running Gentoo at Microsoft, so you just never know

07:15.160 --> 07:16.160
where it's going to go.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.280
I mean, good for them.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.520
Teams looks really great.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.480
However, I'm all about the Zulip hype.

07:20.480 --> 07:26.320
Yeah, there was a release this week of Zulip 2.1, which is somewhat like Slack and Mattermost

07:26.320 --> 07:33.360
and Teams, but it has this kind of unique feature in that it has topic-based threading.

07:33.360 --> 07:37.720
Now, I have to admit something here, until this week, I'd never heard of Zulip.

07:37.720 --> 07:38.720
Okay, all right.

07:38.720 --> 07:43.080
All right, I have to admit I did not know of it either.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.400
But it looks really cool.

07:44.400 --> 07:50.880
I mean, like everything else is just completely inadequate now compared to Zulip.

07:50.880 --> 07:54.320
They talk about a couple of things in here that really resonate with me.

07:54.320 --> 07:58.200
But the other thing I kind of grok when reading through this was, this could be a perfect

07:58.200 --> 08:02.640
solution for open-source projects that want to move away from mailing lists, but they

08:02.640 --> 08:08.880
don't want to go into some sort of weird Apple-only chat ecosystem, because Zulip has some really

08:08.880 --> 08:16.200
nice export to HTML features that still reproduce that mail archive-like list from your chats.

08:16.200 --> 08:21.940
But the thing that really makes Zulip stand out is the way they speak to my brain.

08:21.940 --> 08:28.880
They have built a chat collaboration system that allows for busy, silly discussions with

08:28.880 --> 08:34.060
GIFs, lots of little silly posts that are taking up the chat, while still allowing people

08:34.060 --> 08:38.280
from all different time zones to follow the important bits and allow management.

08:38.280 --> 08:41.840
In fact, they even make a point here that really clicked with me.

08:41.840 --> 08:48.040
They said, in practice, organizations that use Slack, many senior personnel don't read

08:48.040 --> 08:54.400
the entire channel messages at all, or only read a handful of the smaller channels.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.380
Is that not literally what happens with me and some of our channels sometimes when things

08:57.380 --> 08:58.380
get busy?

08:58.380 --> 08:59.380
Yes.

08:59.380 --> 09:00.380
I know.

09:00.380 --> 09:02.320
And it's true for all of the leadership at Linux Academy.

09:02.320 --> 09:05.700
It really is a problem to stay up to date with all the different Slack channels that

09:05.700 --> 09:06.920
we have.

09:06.920 --> 09:12.420
This is organized by topics, where you can have a channel, and then you have subtopics.

09:12.420 --> 09:17.200
And it's designed to allow remote workers that are in different time zones to participate.

09:17.200 --> 09:22.080
And make information more discoverable that is critical to a project or something you're

09:22.080 --> 09:24.960
trying to actually execute and get done.

09:24.960 --> 09:25.960
It's really clever.

09:25.960 --> 09:30.620
And then you combine that with the fact that it's all open source and designed to publicly

09:30.620 --> 09:35.520
archive all of the discussions to make it discoverable by the greater community.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.080
Check, check, check for me.

09:37.080 --> 09:38.800
I really think this is impressive.

09:38.800 --> 09:43.520
Haven't run it yet, but Zula looks like it's a Slack killer to me for open source projects.

09:43.520 --> 09:47.480
You know what jumped out at me from this release announcement, that there's a one click digital

09:47.480 --> 09:49.240
ocean deployment.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.560
Well that's speaking to a need here.

09:51.560 --> 09:55.360
That's one of the things about Slack that makes it really easy to set up or maybe remote

09:55.360 --> 09:59.600
hosted Mattermost as a service is it's one button deployment.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.800
Well they got that with this and I think that's really important for a lot of projects.

10:03.800 --> 10:07.400
They don't have a lot of people on a project, they just want to start collaborating and

10:07.400 --> 10:08.400
get to work.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.060
They don't want to spend a day standing up a server.

10:11.060 --> 10:15.560
You know if time allows over the holiday, I might dig into the backstory of Zula because

10:15.560 --> 10:21.240
it seems very feature complete and they're now releasing 2.1, which is really the main

10:21.240 --> 10:22.880
headline this week.

10:22.880 --> 10:27.260
I feel a little embarrassed that I didn't know about this and I may have been using

10:27.260 --> 10:29.640
this had I known about it sooner.

10:29.640 --> 10:33.520
And maybe I could find out the backstory and where they came from and how long they've

10:33.520 --> 10:34.520
been doing this.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.720
I'll dig into it over the holiday if time allows.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.800
Well also over the holiday you could potentially host an instance on a Raspberry Pi.

10:40.800 --> 10:45.960
On a Ubuntu of all things, this is really nice to see two things coming out of Canonical

10:45.960 --> 10:48.520
this week regarding the Raspberry Pis.

10:48.520 --> 10:55.720
Number one, USB ports are now functional on the 64-bit images for the Raspberry Pi 4,

10:55.720 --> 10:58.360
which is something that bit me, very nice to see that.

10:58.360 --> 11:05.080
But number two and perhaps bigger picture, the Raspberry Pi is now considered or maybe

11:05.080 --> 11:11.040
has been considered but is officially publicly stated by Canonical a first class platform.

11:11.040 --> 11:15.040
Yeah they say we're working with Raspberry Pi Foundation to have an officially supported

11:15.040 --> 11:20.040
image of Ubuntu available at every new release of a Raspberry Pi board.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.040
That's pretty big.

11:21.040 --> 11:22.040
That's huge.

11:22.040 --> 11:25.260
Because it's taken a while for the Raspberry Pi 4, but if they're going to get together

11:25.260 --> 11:29.160
with them and whatever the next Pi is, there'll be day one support.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.160
That's amazing.

11:30.160 --> 11:35.280
Yeah, they don't say they have something sorted out with the Foundation, but they're working

11:35.280 --> 11:39.580
towards it, which either means that Canonical will just brute force make it happen or if

11:39.580 --> 11:44.480
best case scenario, they'll get a heads up from the Foundation and get some pre-production

11:44.480 --> 11:45.480
boards.

11:45.480 --> 11:50.840
Also very worth noting when you consider edge devices or development experimentation, they

11:50.840 --> 11:56.400
plan to deliver Ubuntu Server 1804 and Ubuntu Core for the Raspberry Pi boards for all of

11:56.400 --> 12:01.240
them and officially support it, which kind of plays into their overall Kubernetes cluster

12:01.240 --> 12:03.400
strategy, but also their developer story.

12:03.400 --> 12:07.300
Well, we talked about last week how ARM is getting more and more popular and having a

12:07.300 --> 12:12.280
board there that you know is going to be supported by Ubuntu to build your applications on and

12:12.280 --> 12:16.880
do your testing is going to make more and more people use Ubuntu, which is what Canonical

12:16.880 --> 12:17.880
wants.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.960
The other thing that I know some that are listening to this are screaming right now

12:20.960 --> 12:24.920
is there's more powerful systems in the Raspberry Pi guys.

12:24.920 --> 12:25.920
Don't you know?

12:25.920 --> 12:34.280
Yes, we do know, but the Raspberry Pi has a very steady, predictable cadence and it

12:34.280 --> 12:43.400
has the deepest ecosystem, both in third party images, community support, et cetera, and

12:43.400 --> 12:47.440
it without a question has the largest brand awareness.

12:47.440 --> 12:50.120
And it has the sheer numbers as well.

12:50.120 --> 12:56.400
Eben Upton this week tweeted that they've sold 30 million Raspberry Pis and he also

12:56.400 --> 13:02.160
said that that makes the revenue a billion dollars that they've taken in by selling these

13:02.160 --> 13:03.160
things.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.760
I mean, these are McDonald's hamburgers numbers at this point.

13:05.760 --> 13:11.400
Not quite, but there's certainly numbers that you can't ignore.

13:11.400 --> 13:16.160
It's not quite the kind of iPhone numbers or whatever, but can you imagine if they sold

13:16.160 --> 13:21.560
30 million Pine phones or something, that would be quite the story, right?

13:21.560 --> 13:27.160
And I think the unspoken truth here is none of us doubt that there will be a Raspberry

13:27.160 --> 13:34.240
Pi 5 or several iterations of the four that might even go up to eight gigs of RAM or beyond.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.440
That's just a foregone conclusion at this point.

13:36.440 --> 13:41.440
And that kind of reliable cadence is the exact type of thing developers find comfort in.

13:41.440 --> 13:46.160
It means I can prototype a product around this platform and I can kind of already foresee

13:46.160 --> 13:49.760
where it's going without it even being written down.

13:49.760 --> 13:53.440
That's the exact kind of thing that draws people to build things around something.

13:53.440 --> 13:59.040
I think this is a very clever move on Canonical's part to say it so boldly, because I think

13:59.040 --> 14:03.360
a lot of distributions have every intention of supporting future Raspberry Pis.

14:03.360 --> 14:09.000
I bet a lot of them do, but by implicitly stating it, they are reassuring the developer

14:09.000 --> 14:11.720
community that this is going to be a thing.

14:11.720 --> 14:17.320
And that's the sort of psychological aspect to this market that I think Canonical and

14:17.320 --> 14:19.320
the people behind Ubuntu really get.

14:19.320 --> 14:24.860
Well, all that might well become irrelevant once Fuchsia takes over.

14:24.860 --> 14:27.360
The operating system that seems to taunt Joe and I.

14:27.360 --> 14:30.800
I don't know if it taunts anybody else out there, but we're always watching what's going

14:30.800 --> 14:35.400
on with Fuchsia because it does seem like Google's skunk work project to replace Linux

14:35.400 --> 14:36.400
one day.

14:36.400 --> 14:40.080
The trickle-down effects of that, well, they get one to think.

14:40.080 --> 14:45.000
However, it seems that the takeover is a slow and methodical approach if it is coming, and

14:45.000 --> 14:51.480
it starts really with support for a new piece of hardware, one that you may be familiar

14:51.480 --> 14:52.480
with.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.920
It was discovered a while back that there was a Chrome OS tablet coming that had wireless

14:55.920 --> 15:02.240
charging, and then later revealed that the code name was, I think it's Flapjack, Joe?

15:02.240 --> 15:03.240
Delicious Flapjack, yeah.

15:03.240 --> 15:08.840
Yeah, and I guess it's going to run both Chrome OS and also will run Fuchsia.

15:08.840 --> 15:12.280
Yeah, I don't think you're going to be able to buy it running Fuchsia, but I think it's

15:12.280 --> 15:17.120
going to be a target for Fuchsia for developers, so they'll be able to buy this relatively

15:17.120 --> 15:22.400
inexpensive tablet and then have a target device to do the development.

15:22.400 --> 15:27.800
That seems to be the name of the game here, because if you look at the long strategy here,

15:27.800 --> 15:32.920
Fuchsia OS has gained support for an actual decent amount of devices at this point, including

15:32.920 --> 15:38.120
several smart home products like the Nest Hub and the Nest Hub Max, some smartphones

15:38.120 --> 15:43.080
like the Honor Play, and people are getting it working on the Pixel 2, as well as the

15:43.080 --> 15:48.520
new Pixelbook, and a couple of AMD Chromebooks can already run Fuchsia, and now this will

15:48.520 --> 15:52.520
be added to that list, but like you said, it's expected to be kind of at a price range

15:52.520 --> 15:57.520
more akin to the old Nexus devices approachable by developers.

15:57.520 --> 16:02.480
It's just missing one critical piece, and that's apps.

16:02.480 --> 16:06.840
Well, Google wants you to build those apps using Flutter, and that's had a release this

16:06.840 --> 16:07.840
week.

16:07.840 --> 16:12.380
Not just that, but it was Flutter Interact in New York City this week, a big Flutter

16:12.380 --> 16:18.520
event where they announced their ambient computing initiative now includes Flutter for the web

16:18.520 --> 16:22.140
and Flutter for the Mac.

16:22.140 --> 16:27.640
I think the idea here is to get the developers ahead of the game using Flutter, using Dart,

16:27.640 --> 16:32.040
which immediately translates to application compatibility with Fuchsia.

16:32.040 --> 16:36.960
Yeah, this is very much Google playing the long game on this, and it seems like it could

16:36.960 --> 16:39.640
be a pretty successful strategy to me.

16:39.640 --> 16:44.200
There's a couple of examples of Flutter for the web applications that are now live, and

16:44.200 --> 16:45.600
they're decent.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.360
They're actually kind of decent web applications.

16:48.360 --> 16:53.580
This is the very long game for Google to go about it this methodically where they're building

16:53.580 --> 16:59.560
this operating system up from the ground, and then getting an ecosystem built by using

16:59.560 --> 17:04.200
these third-party devices over a period of years.

17:04.200 --> 17:07.240
If this eventually pops, it's going to be huge.

17:07.240 --> 17:10.760
That's what kind of disturbs me about it.

17:10.760 --> 17:15.160
I feel better about it if they were more traditional and they just released a half-baked product

17:15.160 --> 17:21.000
that wasn't really all that great running on a Pixelbook knockoff that YouTubers would

17:21.000 --> 17:24.200
say is horrible and everybody should buy an iPad instead, and then we'd just move on and

17:24.200 --> 17:25.920
everybody would keep using Linux.

17:25.920 --> 17:31.240
But instead, they're doing it the right way, and it kind of makes me wonder if this isn't

17:31.240 --> 17:35.360
going to be a thing that we have to contend with, and I don't know what that means long

17:35.360 --> 17:36.360
term.

17:36.360 --> 17:40.660
The analogy I would make is with someone who wants to be an entertainer, right?

17:40.660 --> 17:46.680
If you've got that backup career and you can just go for it slowly and build your other

17:46.680 --> 17:53.200
career, your new entertainment career, being a rock star or actor or whatever, you don't

17:53.200 --> 17:56.720
have that pressure on you that it has to be done right now.

17:56.720 --> 18:01.200
They have got Chrome OS, they've got Android, and so there's no rush for this.

18:01.200 --> 18:06.960
They can just slowly, slowly build it up until it's ready, and then suddenly Linux is just

18:06.960 --> 18:07.960
crushed.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.600
At least on the mobile market.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.780
I would just hate it if we had to wipe that smug look off our face when we see people

18:13.780 --> 18:17.680
pull out Android phones and we think to ourselves, Linux user, you don't even know it, but you're

18:17.680 --> 18:18.680
running Linux.

18:18.680 --> 18:19.880
I would hate to lose that.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.200
That's a moment of pride in my day right now.

18:22.200 --> 18:27.640
Well, I'm more worried about servers, to be honest, because there's no reason why you

18:27.640 --> 18:31.760
can't adapt it in the same way that Linux you can use as a desktop operating system

18:31.760 --> 18:34.520
or on the server or in containers and cloud, whatever.

18:34.520 --> 18:38.080
There's not really any reason why long term, future can't do that.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.740
That'll be the day.

18:39.740 --> 18:41.480
Over my dead body, Joe.

18:41.480 --> 18:42.480
That's not happening.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.400
No way.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.360
Linux from my lifetime has won the server.

18:47.360 --> 18:55.280
I think that really is true because it's the platform that lets you run anything you want.

18:55.280 --> 19:03.240
If you remember when mono was a thing, remember Java and wine and PHP, like all these different

19:03.240 --> 19:09.380
crazy systems, they wouldn't be in some clean, nice vendor controlled platform.

19:09.380 --> 19:13.260
Only Linux allows you to build the application and whatever the hell you need to get the

19:13.260 --> 19:17.120
job done and then run it on a server and run it at scale.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.040
And I just think that's too invaluable.

19:19.040 --> 19:25.080
The processor architecture could change, but the fundamentals about a general purpose technology

19:25.080 --> 19:30.000
platform that is freely available for anyone to take and then build their product around

19:30.000 --> 19:34.920
with no major court, one singular corporation controlling it all, it's too good to pass

19:34.920 --> 19:35.920
up.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.800
So I think on the server we're safe.

19:37.800 --> 19:43.040
However, mobile, maybe laptops, a little bit worried.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.040
Just a little bit.

19:44.040 --> 19:48.800
Well, the way I see it, the underlying operating system is becoming less and less important.

19:48.800 --> 19:53.240
And if you can make it more efficient in terms of power, electricity and everything, does

19:53.240 --> 19:55.600
it really matter what's running underneath all the containers?

19:55.600 --> 19:57.240
I know that is true.

19:57.240 --> 20:06.600
I'll tell you my moment of panic will be when Microsoft releases office 365 apps for fuchsia.

20:06.600 --> 20:10.480
When teams comes out for fuchsia, I'm freaking out.

20:10.480 --> 20:14.720
Well, it probably won't be that long, but we'll see.

20:14.720 --> 20:18.720
There's probably more chance of Twitter being decentralized than that though.

20:18.720 --> 20:22.560
What do you think of this project blue story or whatever they're calling it, where they

20:22.560 --> 20:29.160
claim they're going to set up a strike team of around five individuals or so within Twitter,

20:29.160 --> 20:38.600
but also kind of their own organization potentially to develop or end up adopting a protocol based

20:38.600 --> 20:43.840
decentralized platform for Twitter, where Twitter itself would become a client of that

20:43.840 --> 20:46.320
said new decentralized platform?

20:46.320 --> 20:49.260
I'm very skeptical to calling it project blue sky.

20:49.260 --> 20:50.800
That's what it is.

20:50.800 --> 20:54.880
It's funded by Twitter, but it's going to be an external entity somehow.

20:54.880 --> 20:58.600
It seems like if you're really going to do something like that, five people, that's not

20:58.600 --> 21:00.080
really enough, is it?

21:00.080 --> 21:07.420
Well, I mean, it could be if you adopt an existing standard like activity pub and throw

21:07.420 --> 21:12.320
millions of dollars at it and three or four developers, that could work.

21:12.320 --> 21:17.600
If you're going to roll your own solution and invent your own new protocol and standard,

21:17.600 --> 21:18.600
I don't think so.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.740
You'd have to grow it pretty rapidly.

21:20.740 --> 21:27.340
This whole thing, Joe, is really strange because this was more like how Twitter started.

21:27.340 --> 21:35.600
They made changes back in 2012 that begun the process of locking this down and centralizing

21:35.600 --> 21:36.600
it.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.680
I don't know if you recall, but there's a great Verge piece we'll have linked in the

21:38.680 --> 21:43.920
show notes, and they write on here, death came to the Twitter developer community on

21:43.920 --> 21:45.840
August 12, 2012.

21:45.840 --> 21:50.720
In an infamous memo, the company's head of product divided potential uses of the Twitter

21:50.720 --> 21:53.000
API into four quadrants.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.320
I think we all remember, if you're a Twitter user at least, when that happened.

21:58.320 --> 22:04.760
That policy led Twitter to become really a centralized platform that was designed to

22:04.760 --> 22:07.200
sell advertising.

22:07.200 --> 22:12.320
Interestingly enough, at the time, the CEO of Twitter was a former Googler who was hell

22:12.320 --> 22:15.200
bent on building an ad platform.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.320
Kind of funny how that works.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.200
Now Jack Dorsey takes over.

22:18.200 --> 22:23.720
He has been a little more resistant to censorship or shutting things down to some degree.

22:23.720 --> 22:30.000
He can argue it, but it seems like maybe he really does see Twitter as a possible SMTP

22:30.000 --> 22:31.800
of the future.

22:31.800 --> 22:36.080
Maybe if you're to take him at his word, he really wants to decentralize this thing so

22:36.080 --> 22:40.220
that way you can have some versions of Twitter that are tightly controlled with speech and

22:40.220 --> 22:44.240
others that are sort of a Wild West.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.300
That's just wishful thinking, I think, Joe.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.960
Did you listen to the two podcasts he did with Rogan?

22:48.960 --> 22:49.960
Bits of it.

22:49.960 --> 22:55.480
I really, I just don't care enough about Twitter to go any further.

22:55.480 --> 22:59.880
I ask because what came across to me on those two podcasts is that he sees himself as a

22:59.880 --> 23:01.760
visionary, Jack Dorsey.

23:01.760 --> 23:09.680
He feels that Twitter is nowhere near complete in terms of what it's going to become.

23:09.680 --> 23:15.880
I'm not hugely surprised that he's got this grand vision for it, but it just seems like

23:15.880 --> 23:22.200
we have decentralized social media already with Mastodon and we had Diaspora.

23:22.200 --> 23:28.200
They are relatively popular, but they are just dwarfed by the size of Twitter.

23:28.200 --> 23:34.440
It's very, very difficult to make a decentralized system popular.

23:34.440 --> 23:39.120
The whole point of Twitter is everyone's there and yeah, okay, if it's federated across loads

23:39.120 --> 23:44.540
of different servers, everyone will be on one of them somehow, but until someone makes

23:44.540 --> 23:50.240
it as simple as signing up for Twitter and then it's just at your name to talk to other

23:50.240 --> 23:52.440
people and follow them.

23:52.440 --> 23:57.440
I don't think that decentralized social media is going to go anywhere, but I don't know.

23:57.440 --> 24:01.320
He is this real visionary, at least in his own head he is.

24:01.320 --> 24:05.280
Maybe he is going to be the person to do this, but I'm just very skeptical.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.600
I got a vision.

24:06.600 --> 24:13.600
How about a social communications platform where anyone could host their own server or

24:13.600 --> 24:17.340
there could be large centralized servers depending on your preferred flavor and then there'd

24:17.340 --> 24:21.840
be a bunch of third-party clients that could match your particular style and you could

24:21.840 --> 24:28.040
connect multiple servers from one client and then on these servers, you could have individual

24:28.040 --> 24:33.040
rooms dedicated to topics for individual particular areas of interest.

24:33.040 --> 24:34.600
What do you think of that?

24:34.600 --> 24:38.680
It could be on any server or it could be on centralized servers, whichever you prefer.

24:38.680 --> 24:42.160
Would all of the rooms have to start with a pound sign?

24:42.160 --> 24:43.160
Yes.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.160
Yes.

24:44.160 --> 24:45.160
Yes.

24:45.160 --> 24:47.880
I'm talking about IRC, obviously.

24:47.880 --> 24:54.200
Yeah, this is somewhat reinventing the wheel, I suppose, but it would be interesting if

24:54.200 --> 24:58.400
Twitter was just one client that connected to the network.

24:58.400 --> 25:03.120
I have seen people saying that it is just Jack Dorsey trying to get out of this moderation

25:03.120 --> 25:07.880
problem that they have and trying to wash his hands of the responsibility for moderating

25:07.880 --> 25:08.880
the platform.

25:08.880 --> 25:09.880
I could see that.

25:09.880 --> 25:16.360
However, I think that's shortchanging the importance of the topic of communication.

25:16.360 --> 25:21.320
Look at just our episode, Microsoft Teams for Linux, which is a direct competitor to

25:21.320 --> 25:26.800
Slack, which has completely changed the way companies communicate and a lot of projects

25:26.800 --> 25:27.800
communicate.

25:27.800 --> 25:32.840
Then we talked about an open source competitor, Zulip, that's offering things that solve problems

25:32.840 --> 25:38.000
like time zone differences and busy, goofy, different discussion groups and public posting

25:38.000 --> 25:39.740
and review.

25:39.740 --> 25:44.600
Now here we are discussing Twitter, which has become sort of a centralized communication

25:44.600 --> 25:48.880
platform of signals that some people think should be broken up.

25:48.880 --> 25:55.280
I think the underlying theme of all of it is how we communicate online and the bandwidth

25:55.280 --> 26:00.360
of that communication, the richness of that communication is becoming more important than

26:00.360 --> 26:01.360
ever.

26:01.360 --> 26:07.840
While I make jokes about IRC, I think it is clear that IRC was not high enough bandwidth.

26:07.840 --> 26:15.240
It was not rich enough in information in detail and that there is a strong desire for a better

26:15.240 --> 26:16.680
way to communicate.

26:16.680 --> 26:21.400
And then there are a bunch of players like Slack, like Microsoft and others like Twitter

26:21.400 --> 26:27.200
and Facebook and et cetera, that want to be the resource that everybody goes to to solve

26:27.200 --> 26:28.200
this problem.

26:28.200 --> 26:31.760
I mean, it's clear this is a massive theme of this year, just looking at it right here

26:31.760 --> 26:32.760
in just this one episode.

26:32.760 --> 26:36.880
Well, who knows what's going to happen, but there's a quote at the end of that Verge article

26:36.880 --> 26:43.520
that you mentioned from a former employee of Twitter and they say, well, it's Twitter,

26:43.520 --> 26:45.720
so nothing's going to happen for 20 years.

26:45.720 --> 26:50.320
And in the meantime, things will just keep moving forward.

26:50.320 --> 26:55.160
On Linux, gaming may have a bit of a bumpy road in the near future.

26:55.160 --> 27:02.000
One of the key developers, the main developer behind DXVK has recently expressed some frustrations

27:02.000 --> 27:07.600
and some plans to transition the project into maintenance mode, even if it's not necessarily

27:07.600 --> 27:08.760
feature complete yet.

27:08.760 --> 27:15.640
Yeah, Philip says that DXVK has become a fragile, unreliable and frustrating maintenance nightmare.

27:15.640 --> 27:17.240
That doesn't sound good, does it?

27:17.240 --> 27:18.240
No.

27:18.240 --> 27:22.280
And this is kind of an important gaming technology for those of us who enjoy a game or two on

27:22.280 --> 27:23.280
Linux.

27:23.280 --> 27:29.040
As a reminder, DXVK is that Vulkan based translation layer for Direct3D 10 or 11, which allows

27:29.040 --> 27:35.520
those applications to translate to Vulkan calls, which makes them run on Linux.

27:35.520 --> 27:38.720
It's not going away, so it'll still exist.

27:38.720 --> 27:42.680
But he says, I'm going to add a few more features and then I think I'm done.

27:42.680 --> 27:46.520
Now the communities are trying to come up with ways they could support him because this

27:46.520 --> 27:49.120
type of expertise is very unique.

27:49.120 --> 27:53.160
It's not like there's 100 other developers with free time on their hands that could pick

27:53.160 --> 27:56.760
up this particular kind of heavy hitting work.

27:56.760 --> 28:00.880
Yeah, and combine that with Feral's lead Vulkan developer leaving the company to go to Sony

28:00.880 --> 28:04.080
and it's kind of a double whammy.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.080
Indeed.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.440
These individuals are highly coveted.

28:07.440 --> 28:08.680
They are extremely skilled.

28:08.680 --> 28:14.360
This is a very specialized area of work and Alex Smith, who oversaw Feral's Vulkan support,

28:14.360 --> 28:18.880
was key in seeing that company move to Vulkan, which opened up a whole new window of opportunity

28:18.880 --> 28:20.480
for Linux games.

28:20.480 --> 28:25.320
He also did work in the past on some Nintendo Switch ports for Feral, as well as some of

28:25.320 --> 28:26.660
the Linux ports.

28:26.660 --> 28:32.020
So while it's a loss for Feral, they had responded on Twitter saying that they do have more games

28:32.020 --> 28:36.660
planned for 2020 and they do have a fully functional Direct3D to Vulkan layer in place

28:36.660 --> 28:39.240
that so far is working for them.

28:39.240 --> 28:44.040
But when these two stories are combined, it does sort of feel like one of those couple

28:44.040 --> 28:47.600
of steps forward recently, but now we've taken maybe a half step back.

28:47.600 --> 28:48.800
We've lost a little momentum.

28:48.800 --> 28:52.960
Yeah, just when things were seemingly going so well with gaming on Linux, it's a shame

28:52.960 --> 28:53.960
really.

28:53.960 --> 28:59.160
So there was kind of a glimmer of hope for gaming on Linux and that is that Nvidia may

28:59.160 --> 29:02.000
possibly open source some drivers next year.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Yeah.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.460
Michael Larable coming in with a hot fresh rumor that's almost guaranteed to be a fact

29:07.460 --> 29:08.460
doomer.

29:08.460 --> 29:09.680
I'm not sure what you call that.

29:09.680 --> 29:13.820
But he says start looking forward to March when Nvidia looks to have some sort of open

29:13.820 --> 29:20.360
source driver initiative to announce, likely contributing more to Novu.

29:20.360 --> 29:26.960
This is based on a tip that he got on a GTC session, which is Nvidia's event that's happening

29:26.960 --> 29:27.960
in March.

29:27.960 --> 29:32.360
And they have a session titled open source Linux kernel and Nvidia.

29:32.360 --> 29:37.440
And the abstract of the talk is we'll report up to minute developments on Nvidia status

29:37.440 --> 29:43.120
and activities and possibly a few future plans and directions regarding our contributions

29:43.120 --> 29:49.320
to the Linux kernel supporting Novu, the open source kernel driver for Nvidia GPUs that's

29:49.320 --> 29:57.920
in the Linux kernel and including sign firmware behavior, documentation and patches and Nvidia's

29:57.920 --> 30:01.720
kernel drivers and quote.

30:01.720 --> 30:08.020
If they even like do half of that stuff in March or announce a plan throughout 2020 to

30:08.020 --> 30:16.440
roll that out, that would be a huge enabler for not just gaming on Linux, but workstation

30:16.440 --> 30:19.560
using graphic loads like CUDA and others on Linux.

30:19.560 --> 30:23.840
I mean, just massively huge for people that have spent good money on hardware in their

30:23.840 --> 30:24.840
computer.

30:24.840 --> 30:28.840
If you told me that they were going to do this a year or so ago, I would have not believed

30:28.840 --> 30:32.080
you or said there was more chance of you pronouncing Novu correctly.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.080
Right.

30:33.080 --> 30:34.080
Absolutely.

30:34.080 --> 30:37.960
Which, let's face it, very small chance of that happening.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.400
But this does look promising.

30:39.400 --> 30:40.400
It sure does.

30:40.400 --> 30:45.060
If it was just a rumor without that abstract, I'd be like, well, that could mean anything.

30:45.060 --> 30:47.640
That could just be a talk on how great Nvidia is.

30:47.640 --> 30:51.880
But when you combine it with the abstract description, that's where it really makes

30:51.880 --> 30:54.480
you think something's about to shift.

30:54.480 --> 30:55.720
And perhaps it should.

30:55.720 --> 30:59.480
I have to say, I've really enjoyed the AMD graphics cards I've bought this year.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.800
I've popped them in my systems.

31:01.800 --> 31:08.360
And no fuss, I have fantastic 3D support for games, desktop effects, anything I want.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.720
And I never had to even check a box.

31:10.720 --> 31:13.340
Well, fingers crossed they are going to compete with it.

31:13.340 --> 31:16.960
And we will definitely follow that progress as it goes throughout next year.

31:16.960 --> 31:17.960
I know it's big for you.

31:17.960 --> 31:21.800
You know, you're a big GPU buyer, so.

31:21.800 --> 31:22.800
What GPU do you have?

31:22.800 --> 31:23.800
I don't.

31:23.800 --> 31:30.000
I've got this huge case with no GPU or hard drives or anything in it.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.400
Now I know what to get you for Christmas.

31:31.400 --> 31:36.160
Well, we'll follow that and all the other stories, as always, so go to linuxactionnews.com
