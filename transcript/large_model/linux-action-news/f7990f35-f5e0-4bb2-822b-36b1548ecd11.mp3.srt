00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,120
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,080
This is episode 34, recorded on December 19th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,480
Hello Joe, what do you know, it's good to be connected with you once more.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,160
And I've been looking forward to this episode all week because you and I have been polishing

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,720
our crystal balls.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,880
We're recording this a little bit ahead of time for the holidays.

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,640
And I'm not going to I'm not going to lie, I'm really looking forward to hearing what

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,320
you think is going to happen in Linux for the rest of the year.

11
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,800
Okay, well, let me start with a very safe one.

12
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,320
As far as I'm concerned, I want to get at least one thing correct.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,880
You stole this one from me.

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,500
Well, yeah, you know.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,840
So my first prediction is that Ubuntu Unity 7 will become an official flavor in 2018.

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,160
I don't think 1804.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
I think that's too soon.

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,680
But I think 1810.

19
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
It will be official.

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,920
Oh, official.

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,000
So I think there will definitely be an 1804 that you can install, because they're already

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,440
working on a daily ISO.

23
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,440
I like this.

24
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,280
I like this benchmark, though, of like canonical officially recognizes it as a flavor.

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,000
And you're saying that's not till 1810.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,480
Yeah, I like that.

27
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,480
Okay.

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,080
So I think that's almost a foregone conclusion.

29
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,480
So there's your safe bet.

30
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,160
You ready for my safe bet for 2018?

31
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:30,440
And it's not necessarily a positive one, but I think Linux servers and IoT devices that

32
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:36,760
run Linux are going to see the largest increase in attacks, like the kind of attacks that

33
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,220
you would normally attribute it to IIS boxes and things that distribute worms and malware,

34
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,560
like the Mirai botnet that we saw recently.

35
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,000
And most of it's going to be caused by out of date or bad defaults.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,280
Well, that's pretty obvious, isn't it?

37
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,940
How are you going to quantify this?

38
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,440
The key prediction that I'm going for here is a large increase in the percentage.

39
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,560
So at the end of 2018, the conversation will be the new attack vector, the normal attack

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,940
vector is Linux, it won't be even new.

41
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:10,960
At the end of 2018, what my prediction is, is that it's a foregone conclusion that all

42
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,000
of these little IoT devices running kernel 2.2 and 2.4, and these web servers that are

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,640
running agent versions of Apache, we're approaching peak negligence, I think.

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,760
And I think 2018 is the year that bill will come due.

45
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, I can't argue with that.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,240
I think that's a pretty safe bet, along with the Unity 7 one.

47
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,240
All right.

48
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
What about you?

49
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,240
You got anything a little more further out there?

50
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,160
Well, a little bit further out there.

51
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:41,520
Okay, so Microsoft Linux, probably Azure Linux, to be fair, but a Linux distro from Microsoft.

52
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,840
We've had a Linux distro that's kind of network stuff, but I'm talking a full blown, like

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,320
Amazon Linux 2 style distro for Azure made by Microsoft with a name like Microsoft Linux

54
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:04,180
or Azure Linux, and it's going to have tight integration with the Windows 10 desktop and

55
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,500
all the developer options, and you're going to be able to probably have really fast SSH

56
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,320
access to it or something, but it's all about pushing Azure and it's all about taking control

57
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,520
of that with a Microsoft distro.

58
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:23,360
You could really see Microsoft integrating it further and deeper into Visual Studio Code

59
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,000
and Visual Studio itself, where one click button, you've spun up an Azure Linux instance

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,560
and you can keep it or discard it.

61
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,440
You can try your code out on the public infrastructure with one click of a button, and they're getting

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,400
really close there now, and their own version of Linux in light of Amazon's continued investment

63
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,000
in their own version of Linux, I think that is a safe bet.

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,060
I think you may be in safe bet territory here where I would like to go a little fringy with

65
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,800
this if I could just ride on your coattails a bit is wouldn't it be something if Microsoft

66
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,640
took a stab at building a virtual desktop instance?

67
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,360
Never going to happen, but this is going to throughout 2018 become an area of hosted Linux

68
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,540
we don't talk a lot about now, but behind the scenes, I've heard from several listeners

69
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,460
that their entire freaking company is running on virtual instances on Amazon's infrastructure.

70
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,120
They don't even have a singular desktop PC in their office.

71
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,560
What are you talking sort of HTML5 console type stuff?

72
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,900
I'm talking thin client hooked up to a monitoring keyboard that uses some sort of remote desktop

73
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,000
protocol to remote into an Azure instance.

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,340
There's obviously they would do that with Windows, but wouldn't it be fascinating if

75
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,760
eventually they create like a developer workstation distribution?

76
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,880
It's way out there pie in the sky stuff, but I wouldn't be too surprised if you don't see

77
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,840
something like that arrive on Amazon's infrastructure or a similar infrastructure soon.

78
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,320
So you think that maybe eventually, probably not in 2018, but eventually Microsoft may

79
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,620
build on this idea of a Microsoft Linux and then possibly put the Windows shell on top

80
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,620
of that?

81
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:01,280
No, no, but I do think what will happen is in 2018 is other businesses will ship a hosted

82
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,360
Linux desktop and Microsoft will watch that and then respond competitively.

83
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,040
Yeah, I suppose that sounds reasonable, but I still think it would be a very Windows 10

84
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,360
like shell on top of it.

85
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,600
Yeah, it was probably some sort of horrible Cortana integration.

86
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,160
Yeah, yeah, they're not going to ship some GTK thing.

87
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,760
No, no, I don't think so.

88
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,760
All right.

89
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,280
Well, here's my kind of other prediction that's a little bit further out there, but it seems

90
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,520
to be if you ask me that the general way that things are trending and it's this gap that

91
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,600
we're seeing slowly develop in 2017 that I think is going to blow wide open in 2018 between

92
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,540
the idealist Linux user and the pragmatist Linux user.

93
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,160
And so let's define some of these terms a little bit.

94
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,600
An idealist is somebody who's using Linux for moral reasons, ideological reasons, you

95
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,600
know, the license, things like that nature.

96
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,800
Whereas the pragmatist is somebody who is buying a pre-built Linux system to do web

97
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,720
development work or to work on their network or whatever that use case might be.

98
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,080
It's somebody who's buying a Linux system or building a Linux system to do work.

99
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,720
So you're talking about the difference between someone who buys a Purism laptop with the

100
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,160
idea of running core boot and completely free software versus someone who just buys something

101
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,480
with a really fancy Nvidia card and loads steam on it as soon as they get it.

102
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,720
Yeah, your ThinkPad purchasers out there, your Sputnik purchasers out there, your HP

103
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,760
Spectre purchases out there.

104
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:36,060
People that want a really functional work computer that are also a little more comfortable

105
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,440
with using Slack.

106
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,400
They're okay with using Telegram.

107
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,840
These applications that aren't even necessarily 100% native on Linux, maybe they're electron

108
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,600
based, they're okay with it because it lets them get their job done at work.

109
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,120
You know, your system to users out there.

110
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,660
This gap between your idealist and your pragmatist is I think going to be clearly defined as

111
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,640
more and more people are buying these pre-built systems and more and more people are coming

112
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,680
over to Linux to do their day to day work.

113
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,680
I think you're going to have a wider and wider gap between the people that are using Linux

114
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,240
to get their job done and maybe have a couple of proprietary blobs on there and people who

115
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,740
are using Linux because they see it as a way to preserve the intellectual property of humanity.

116
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,240
But don't you have that gap already?

117
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,280
I don't see how this is a prediction really.

118
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,400
We've got this situation already.

119
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,080
The prediction comes in where this pragmatist portion of the Linux based begins to really

120
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,400
explode in growth where all the proper channels are there.

121
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,200
You have System76 with their hardware lineup and their pop OS system designed at a certain

122
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,480
segment of users.

123
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,240
You've got Entraware that's delivering to another segment of users and you've got Dell

124
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,000
that's delivering to another clear segment of users and all of these channels are established

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
now.

126
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,100
Canonical is moving Ubuntu over to the GNOME desktop.

127
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,960
We're consolidating around these particular ideas and standards.

128
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,880
It's becoming the workhorse desktop operating system that a lot of us have wanted for a

129
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
long time.

130
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,280
The groundwork is done now.

131
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:08,020
2017 was the year we did all of that work, but 2018 is going to be the year that we reap

132
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,080
the benefits of all of that investment where we have a bunch of more people that are switching

133
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
over.

134
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,080
They tried the Windows 10 setup.

135
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,240
They're sick and tired of the Mac.

136
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,640
I'm not saying it's going to be tens and tens of millions of people, but it is going to

137
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:25,120
be the largest new infusion of Linux users the Linux desktop has ever seen in 2018 and

138
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,680
that's going to cause all of these flare-ups to become way more weaponized because the

139
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,220
people on the idealist side are going to feel the walls closing in on them.

140
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:37,840
Their situation is getting tighter and tighter and their struggle will become more and more

141
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,320
palatable to save the ideal Linux.

142
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,000
Well, I can't really argue with any of that, but if you read between the lines of what

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,600
you've just said there and kind of filter it down, what you've said is 2018 is going

144
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,280
to be the year of Linux on the desktop.

145
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,320
I actually think it's more pessimistic than that.

146
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,440
I think 2018 is going to be the biggest years of wars we have ever seen in the Linux community,

147
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,160
the largest division and decisiveness we've seen because you're going to have people that

148
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,160
really believe in a cause and they feel like it's starting to slip.

149
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,260
And you're going to have people that don't give a crap about their concerns and just

150
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,000
want to get their damn job done.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,440
And this butting of heads is going to be the biggest we've ever seen.

152
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,760
And I think people that aren't really in tune of what's going on in the larger picture here

153
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,320
are going to report on this in a way that makes it sound like the Linux community is

154
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,880
ripping itself apart.

155
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,040
That I think will be a narrative that emerges throughout 2018.

156
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,540
Well, I hope you're wrong and I hope that what I said about it being the year of Linux

157
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,680
on the desktop.

158
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,080
That is the positive angle of it.

159
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,480
What you've touched on is this is the reaction to that action.

160
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,480
I see what you're saying.

161
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,240
So it is going to be a massive year for Linux on the desktop, but you're going to have this

162
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,440
pushback from the real free software people.

163
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,640
It basically comes back to the old argument, doesn't it, between free software and open

164
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
source.

165
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,120
If I was going to boil this prediction down to a singular sentence, if I could, maybe

166
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
a paragraph, it's this.

167
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,760
2017 was a year of big transition for Linux from idealist to pragmatist operating system.

168
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:08,040
2018 is the year that the community deals with the new reality that scales have tipped.

169
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,880
It's now a pragmatist workstation OS and less of an idealist OS.

170
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,920
Yeah, again, I think that you're right.

171
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,040
And I think that you're right that there's going to be a lot of people left behind by

172
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:24,180
that shift to pragmatism because a lot of people are real idealists, but as new blood

173
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,600
comes into the Linux community, they're going to care less and less about the idealism,

174
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,280
the free software stuff, the FSF approach to it all, and just want to get their work

175
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,880
done and you are going to get the blowback from that.

176
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,760
So yeah, I think that's a reasonable prediction.

177
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,120
But we could not do a predictions episode without talking about Bitcoin.

178
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,720
Let's not talk too much about it.

179
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,840
Let's just put some numbers on this.

180
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:54,320
So what I want from you and what I'm going to give you is the 2018 high in terms of price,

181
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:02,380
dollar value, 2018 low, and then the price on the first of December 2018.

182
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,260
So let's start with the high.

183
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,840
How high do you think it's going to go this coming year?

184
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, in 2017, we nearly got so far to $20,000 for one Bitcoin, 20,000 green US backs.

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,240
Here's the problem with predicting Bitcoin is it's hard to model this because depending

186
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,200
on who you believe, up to 40% of the Bitcoins in existence are held by a very small minority

187
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,720
of the Bitcoin market.

188
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:35,000
And these whales are very capable of manipulating the entire market up or down depending on

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
their whims.

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,800
So this is not a very easy thing to predict.

191
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:46,160
But there is a thought process I've been using recently with Bitcoin.

192
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,800
Most bad news ends up raising the price, even if it causes a temporary decrease in price.

193
00:11:51,800 --> 00:12:00,080
And if these crazy internet people thought that Bitcoin is worth $10, $25, $100, $1,000,

194
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,640
$10,000, and currently they think it's worth $17,000.

195
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,660
If it's worth $17,000, it might be worth $20,000.

196
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,840
And if it's worth $20,000, it might be worth $30,000.

197
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,960
So I'm going to say that the high for 2018 is $100,000.

198
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,660
Oh, that's close to what I was going to say.

199
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,560
So I'm going to say the high for more or less the same reasons as you.

200
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,140
I think the high is going to reach $120,000 in 2018.

201
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,300
So we'll get back to the price on the 1st of December, which is, I suppose, the kind

202
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:39,360
of we have to pick an arbitrary date because it's so volatile that I just picked December

203
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
1st.

204
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,480
So the low.

205
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,200
So at the moment, you said $17,000.

206
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,960
I was looking today, it was kind of $18,000-ish.

207
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,080
I've seen it up very nearly to $20,000.

208
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,480
It didn't quite crack it.

209
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,260
So what do you think the low price is going to be in 2018?

210
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:01,500
We could not have picked a worse time in Bitcoin's entire history to make this prediction because

211
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,920
this week and the week prior and the week prior to that, different huge Wall Street

212
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,240
institutions are coming online and selling Bitcoin futures and creating markets around

213
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:19,560
Bitcoin, which may lead to a price floor that is higher than you and I think because you

214
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,640
have these huge markets that are building around Bitcoin right now and these people

215
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,900
that own the majority of Bitcoin are not going to screw this opportunity up.

216
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,900
They will hold.

217
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:34,920
So I'm going to make the bold prediction that the floor for Bitcoin in 2018, it will never

218
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,300
go below $10,000 a coin.

219
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,300
I think higher than that.

220
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,400
I don't think it's going to drop below $15,000 in 2018.

221
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
Wow.

222
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,860
The only problem here with this prediction, of course, is that some technical flaw could

223
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,240
be discovered or some major quantum computing revolution could come all of a sudden, doubtful,

224
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,640
but it could change the way we compute crypto.

225
00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:00,200
So it's hard, but I feel the fundamentals of a blockchain, a distributed trust system

226
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,720
and a peer-to-peer currency are established and those core ideas are going away.

227
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,360
And the most market successful cryptocurrency that represents those ideas is Bitcoin.

228
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,520
Just you wait.

229
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,560
This time next year, it's going to be worth $100 and we're going to look so bad.

230
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,560
All right.

231
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,900
So the price towards the end of the year, then December 1st, 2018, I know that's difficult

232
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,080
because it depends on what time, but roughly what kind of price do you think it would be

233
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,080
looking at then?

234
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
Hmm.

235
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,320
Well, I think it's going to be the higher end of the spectrum.

236
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,320
I think it's going to be somewhere near the $100,000 range if things are successful.

237
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,400
It feels like with Bitcoin, it's either going to go all the way or it's going to become

238
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,680
worth nothing.

239
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,720
As more and more people discover Bitcoin, the scarcity problem just goes up.

240
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,640
And when the scarcity problem goes up, the value goes up.

241
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:59,880
So it's this sort of bubble effect where as the mainstream world, CNBC here in the States

242
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,840
is talking about it on a daily basis now.

243
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,040
Like I just mentioned, the Wall Street businesses that are doing day trading in Bitcoin, as

244
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:10,320
mainstream adoption and knowledge comes up and people start realizing you don't have

245
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,080
to buy a Bitcoin, you could buy $10 of Bitcoin, you can do fractional investing.

246
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:22,200
And when that really takes off in the mainstream, oh boy, Joe, I just, I feel like what we're

247
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,220
seeing today has been child's play.

248
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,640
It's really just about to get interesting.

249
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,280
So this is the worst time ever, but I'm going to say if it's successful, it's going to be

250
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,400
over $100,000 this time in December.

251
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,640
If something is discovered and it's bankrupt, of course, it's going to just bottom out.

252
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,160
It's going to be one or the other, I think.

253
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,680
Well, I want a number, 1st of December 2018, what's the price?

254
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
$107,000.

255
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
Okay.

256
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
I'm going to go for $100,000.

257
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,480
Are we going price is right rules?

258
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
Not a penny over.

259
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
Yeah, I think we should.

260
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,480
I think we should.

261
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
I think we should.

262
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,520
Not a penny over, whoever gets closer.

263
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,200
And to be fair, I'm not really like, I'm not going to like, I'm not going to say I picked

264
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,800
this number after tons of research.

265
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,480
It's sort of an arbitrary number I chose, but could you imagine, could you imagine the

266
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,920
level of conversation, how much Bitcoin is going to dominate the news if that is the

267
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,920
case?

268
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,880
That's one of the primary things people talk about and you and I are going to have to go

269
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,800
out of our way to avoid dominating the show with Bitcoin.

270
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,920
Because think about it, if it gets to $100,000, dude, it's going to be the only thing people

271
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
talk about.

272
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
Yeah, but don't worry.

273
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:33,160
It'll be worth $100 and we'll just be talking about Fedora and Ubuntu.

274
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,520
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

275
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,600
You go there, you sign up for a free seven day trial to the Linux Academy platform and

276
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,920
you support this here show.

277
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,760
It's a full featured training library with everything you need to learn new skills and

278
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,200
advance your career.

279
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,440
With self-paced, in-depth video courses on every freaking Linux, cloud, and DevOps topic.

280
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,340
And it's consistently getting updated.

281
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,380
So there's new value being added to your Linux Academy subscription all the time.

282
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,240
And there's stuff you've never really even considered taking courseware on and then you

283
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,680
sit down and you go through the process.

284
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,660
And even if you're an old salt, you go, wow, how did I not know that?

285
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,880
How did I not know you could do that little thing?

286
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,800
So there's tiny little bits of value in there all the time.

287
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,960
But the big stuff comes from the hands-on labs or the learning pass if you want to get

288
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,340
somewhere in your career.

289
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,720
Or taking practice exams and getting ready for certification tests.

290
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,140
And the flashcards, which are study guides that are forked by the Linux Academy community

291
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,220
like an open source project.

292
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,900
And they have a very vibrant community stacked full of Jupyter broadcasting members, lots

293
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,920
of comprehensive study guides and lesson audio you can download and take with you.

294
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:41,640
There's so much to learn at Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

And thank you to all of you out there for visiting linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

298
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,560
Okay, so we've talked about what we think is going to happen.

299
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,340
Now let's talk about things that we want to happen.

300
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,920
And I'll start with, I want to see a major cryptocurrency that uses far less energy than

301
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
Bitcoin.

302
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,040
Now I know that you've been very skeptical about these claims of it using as much power

303
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,160
as nations and it's going to be using more power in a few years than the whole world

304
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
combined.

305
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,000
But you cannot deny that it uses a lot of energy.

306
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,620
And I would love to see a cryptocurrency come along that uses way less energy.

307
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:34,080
Maybe it's a proof of space, maybe it's something that no one's even thought of yet, that comes

308
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,280
along and is mainstream.

309
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,680
I talked about last week how Bitcoin is the name, you know, it's the Coca Cola, I think

310
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,000
it's going to maintain that position.

311
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,420
But you've got to have a lot of other cryptocurrencies come along.

312
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:52,440
And it'd be good to see one that was maybe as popular as Ethereum, but uses a fraction

313
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,320
of the energy of any of the coins that we know about now.

314
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,120
I do think the problem is a bit overblown, to be honest, because there's so many options.

315
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,760
You don't have to mine cryptocurrency in one place.

316
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,120
You could move it to where energy options are cheaper.

317
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,600
Where when you're mining coal and oil, you have to go to where the natural resources

318
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
are.

319
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
So I think it's a bit of an overblown problem.

320
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,040
But that said, the solution is already here in several altcoins.

321
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,980
Like you mentioned, proof of storage concepts that have a way less compute overhead.

322
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,560
As long as the Bitcoin network has to be verified and you have to solve these large math problems,

323
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,880
you're going to need a lot of compute.

324
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,600
But that's all ephemeral, it can be moved around.

325
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,820
I wouldn't worry just yet about that problem, Bitcoin energy use, because I feel like the

326
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,760
technology is out there to solve it.

327
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,760
And I wouldn't be too surprised, Joe, if one of these altcoins does manage to sort of build

328
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:46,760
its brand around the eco-friendly currency, the currency that doesn't kill the earth.

329
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,200
And you may end up seeing this sort of wish play out simply because of market dynamics.

330
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,000
Well, hopefully that's what I want to see.

331
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,840
I want to see less energy use generally, because that's got to be a good thing.

332
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,600
But OK, what's your first thing that you want to happen?

333
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,080
It's all about the electron, I think.

334
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,720
And it's not because I want to see electron just take over the Linux desktop.

335
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,480
It's just the realist in me, having just reached this understanding after about a year of fighting

336
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,720
it, understands that it's going to be electron that brings major applications to Linux desktop.

337
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:23,440
So I would like to see an Adobe or a Microsoft launch one of those big missing Linux desktop

338
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,440
apps.

339
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,300
I asked on Twitter a couple of days ago, what is missing on the Linux desktop?

340
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,840
And so many of the answers were some of the Adobe CS applications or this AutoCAD application.

341
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,520
Yeah, the huge proprietary things, Avid, Pro Tools, that sort of thing.

342
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,240
I wonder if electron is up to the task for those really in-depth applications like Avid

343
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,840
that needs hardware acceleration and stuff.

344
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,600
I suppose that's a technical challenge that can be overcome.

345
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,800
And I personally have no problem with electron.

346
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,040
If the application works, I don't care whether it's properly native or electron.

347
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,760
All I care is, does it run?

348
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,960
Does it crash?

349
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,720
Is it going to do the job I need it to do?

350
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,920
I've been wondering that, too.

351
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:08,320
If Adobe released Adobe Premiere for Linux, and they wrote it in electron, and let's just

352
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,840
say for a moment it just worked great.

353
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,480
It used a ton of RAM and stuff, but it just worked great.

354
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,240
That would fundamentally change my life.

355
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,040
I would immediately stop using Final Cut for anything I've ever done, and I would switch

356
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,120
completely over to that on the Linux desktop.

357
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,680
It would change my life.

358
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,240
So that's why I put this on the list.

359
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:32,080
And I do wonder if it's maybe too soon, because there's things out there like WebAssembly that

360
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,200
could bring real native performance to web applications and electron applications that

361
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,920
we may just have to wait around for.

362
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,000
But I feel it in my bones.

363
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,240
I feel like Microsoft or Adobe or somebody is about to drop a major application on Linux,

364
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,240
and I'm betting it's electron.

365
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,240
You're a dreamer, Chris.

366
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,240
That's all I can say.

367
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,680
I can't see it happening, but thankfully this isn't predictions.

368
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,640
I wouldn't mind that happening.

369
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,480
I'm more of a free software idealist rather than pragmatist, but then I do have a pragmatic

370
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,480
streak as well.

371
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,960
I'm a bit of a fence sitter on this one, and I think that overall it probably would be

372
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,240
good for Linux and open source and free software if we had these huge proprietary applications

373
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,800
available on our platform.

374
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,680
I'm not saying I would necessarily be interested in using them, but I think it would draw more

375
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,800
people over to us, and that has got to be a good thing.

376
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,800
That's how I see it.

377
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,720
It gives more options available to people that want to move over to the desktop.

378
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,200
It moves more workflows over to Linux, which is a tide that does rise all boats.

379
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,440
But maybe there's hope for the core architecture, hey, Joe?

380
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,920
I want to see consumer RISC-V boards available.

381
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,720
I'm not expecting laptops.

382
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,440
I'm not expecting complicated high-power machines, but something that reminds you of a Raspberry

383
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:57,840
Pi that is consumer price point around $35, maybe $50, that's based on the RISC-V architecture

384
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,960
that's totally free and open, and then obviously you need the software to run on that.

385
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:12,600
Again, I'm not expecting Plasma 5 to run on it, but some command line stuff, maybe Apache,

386
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,680
NGINX, and other command line applications.

387
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,360
But it would be good if we could have this in the hands of hackers, because at the moment

388
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,600
there are some RISC-V boards available for manufacturers, but they're very expensive.

389
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:32,520
I would like to see in 2018 that price come down to a point where makers, tinkerers, hackers

390
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:38,000
can get hold of these boards and push this architecture forward and get towards a point

391
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,320
where we can have a nice high-powered laptop that's running a RISC-V processor.

392
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,920
That's way in the future, but we need another step, and this is the step that I want to

393
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,920
see in 2018.

394
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:53,120
Ah, so it's like baby steps, because really where you're going is eventually an x86 platform

395
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,600
killer or replacement for you.

396
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,140
That's the dream, but that is so far off at this point that I think that we just have

397
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,800
to be realistic, and something to compete with the Raspberry Pi is a realistic goal.

398
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
Yeah, I like that.

399
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,880
I don't think I have much more to add to it.

400
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,200
I think that's exactly what I'd like to see.

401
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,840
I'll go on the software side here for a moment then if I can, and talk about Pipewire.

402
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,860
I've followed this pretty closely in Linux Unplugged throughout 2017, and now if I could

403
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:24,860
just wave a magic wand, in 2018 I would love to see Pipewire quickly continue to improve

404
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:31,480
and become a competent video and audio pipeline on Linux, perhaps even begin to replace Pulse

405
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,480
Audio.

406
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,480
And, on top of that, we're seeing the very early works in GNOME right now, but I'd like

407
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:44,000
to see a few desktop environments leverage Pipewire for remote desktop access on Wayland,

408
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,000
because we don't have a TeamViewer or VNC style solution for remote access on Wayland,

409
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,600
and Pipewire may offer the most universal approach across distros and across desktop

410
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,180
environments if everybody just has a big kumbaya circle and goes all in, so I have big hopes

411
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,840
for Pipewire in 2018.

412
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,520
Let me read between the lines again.

413
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,420
What you're saying is you want to be able to sit in Lady Joops and remote into the machines

414
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,400
in the studio and work anywhere in the U.S.?

415
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,960
I suppose there may be an element of that.

416
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,440
I also would like to be able to just launch Skype, the new version of Skype, and not have

417
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,760
to completely destroy my audio subsystem.

418
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,640
Yeah, that would be nice, wouldn't it?

419
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,920
But I think that no matter what we do, Microsoft are just going to find a way to break audio

420
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
on Linux with Skype.

421
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,480
Hey, you know, as long as we get somewhere, either it's the audio-video pipeline or the

422
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,880
remote desktop on Wayland, I'm going to consider it a success.

423
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,880
Yeah, okay.

424
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:46,160
Well, something that's been a huge topic at the end of 2017 is the Intel Management Engine.

425
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:52,300
And so what I would love to see is an x86 chipset from either Intel or AMD with less

426
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:59,720
of a proprietary layer, or dare we dream, no proprietary layer, or at least a kill switch.

427
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,220
That is what I would love to see, so that we can have a completely free software laptop

428
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:11,020
that's running an x86 processor, that we can get some serious performance because the likes

429
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:17,040
of RISC-V, it's a very long way off getting serious performance from it.

430
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,840
But I just hate that there's this proprietary thing.

431
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,920
I'm staring at a laptop now that's running code that I have no idea, and no one who I

432
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:29,600
know and respect has access to that code and can tell me whether it's running anything

433
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,600
nefarious.

434
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,400
I just have to trust Intel, and I don't want to do that.

435
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:41,000
If you had to bet a singular Bitcoin on either Intel or AMD doing this, I mean, come on,

436
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
you'd bet it's AMD.

437
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yeah.

438
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,920
Because AMD has the PSP, but they're not as well entrenched into it as Intel is with the

439
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
Management Engine.

440
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,280
Wouldn't you bet that Bitcoin on AMD going PSP-free?

441
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,280
Yeah.

442
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,560
And I think that AMD are more of an agile company.

443
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:58,160
I think there's less of an inertia there.

444
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:03,300
I think for them to pivot to something like this is more likely from AMD.

445
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:08,200
I don't know why, that's just a feeling that I have that they're just willing to take more

446
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,680
risks maybe because they've got less to lose because they're the underdog.

447
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,120
That's how I feel too.

448
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:20,480
And there is a real possibility that 2018 could be a kick-ass year for AMD and Linux

449
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,060
because you have that Intel NUC that Wimpy and I have been waxing on about that's going

450
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,720
to have an Intel CPU with an AMD dedicated GPU all integrated in.

451
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:34,640
AMD has been talking for years about properly open sourcing their GPU driver with lots of

452
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,720
work being done on that.

453
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,680
So you have this new NUC, you have this new open source driver initiative of theirs combined

454
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,960
with the possibility that they would be the most likely company to drop the Management

455
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,260
Engine or in their case the PSP.

456
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,520
This could be a real recipe for a nice Linux workstation.

457
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,520
I agree but I think that they have to put it in a laptop to make it really commercially

458
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:00,040
viable which wouldn't be that hard because those NUC type devices are basically mobile

459
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:06,080
devices anyway and with some cooling modifications and stuff I think you could put that into

460
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,960
a laptop and if they did that I think that that would sell incredibly well among the

461
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:15,360
Linux community with developers and users alike who just want a decent machine.

462
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,480
Yeah, I completely agree.

463
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,680
So my last thing is on the software side.

464
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,600
So if the hardware folks can kind of get their stuff figured out I would really love to wave

465
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,120
my wand and have this be a year of spit and polish on the Linux desktop.

466
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,600
I guess I would just love to see the different distributions compete on their fit and finish

467
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,540
on the polish of their desktop environment and it feels like we're closer there than

468
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:45,080
ever because with AppImage and Snaps and Flatpaks you can have that stable solid desktop

469
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:52,160
that you just polish away at iteratively while you can deliver fresh user applications through

470
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,160
these different methods.

471
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,880
Well I think we've seen this in 2017, haven't we?

472
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,760
I know there's been a lot of disruption with Ubuntu but if you look at something like Fedora

473
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:06,480
the releases they've had this year have been iterative and polish and there's been no amazing

474
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:13,120
changes but it's just been very slow and steady improvements and so I think that what you're

475
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,360
hoping for is kind of already happening.

476
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,400
It's not quite there.

477
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,120
It's like the baby version of it.

478
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:25,160
We're so so so close but it's not where and please forgive me for saying this but I just

479
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:30,240
recently upgraded my Final Cut OS computer and you know I have all this stupid Mac crap

480
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,260
installed on this Final Cut OS.

481
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:37,240
It's all custom configured because it's all got to be tied together and stuff and I thought

482
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,200
all right I'll do this new Hi Sierra.

483
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,200
Hello Sierra.

484
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,040
I'm going to install Hello Sierra and I hit the upgrade button and I thought this is going

485
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,720
to go horrible and when it rebooted after it was all said and done I had no idea.

486
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
I couldn't tell.

487
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,880
I wasn't sure if it was successful or not because nothing changed.

488
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,960
And then I went to the about Final Cut OS and I saw that I had the new version of Final

489
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,480
Cut OS and I thought okay good it was successful.

490
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,320
That's great but nothing else changed like when I reopened my applications they opened

491
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,220
up in the same spot on my window where I had closed them before I did my OS upgrade.

492
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,220
We're not there.

493
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:16,040
I don't know if we're going to get there in 2018 but what I would love to see is the ability

494
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,400
to do a complete distribution upgrade.

495
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:25,600
They go from Fedora 25 to 26 or go from 1710 to 1804 with applications like Chrome and

496
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,360
Spotify and Telegram that are installed via flat packs and snaps and nothing changes with

497
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,360
them.

498
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,560
I do a complete distribution upgrade.

499
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,800
I log back in.

500
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Nothing's changed.

501
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,960
I just have up-to-date software that's secure, slightly better, less bugs hopefully but my

502
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,360
Chrome, my Firefox, my Spotify everything works exactly as it was before I did the update.

503
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,240
Well that's the dream of 2018 being the year of Linux on the desktop isn't it?

504
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,880
It's the pragmatist workstation, the people that just want to get their job done.

505
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,740
Well Joe if we're right or wrong we'll report it to the people.
