00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,980
Episode 228, recorded on February 16th, 2022, I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:11,980
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,980
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,880
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,640
We start this week by keeping a close eye on the last-minute DECK developments.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,200
And the software that powers it, of course.

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:30,520
That's because as we record right now, we're just mere weeks away from the official release.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:36,520
So that does make it rather noteworthy that a major version of Proton has just now been

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,520
released.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,720
I mean, that's the big compatibility layer that makes running Windows games possible

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,480
on the DECK.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,740
It's a critical component for the DECK.

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,940
It's a big part of their strategy.

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:55,360
And Proton 7.0, which is just released, pulls in Wine 7.0, which was a major release on

16
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
its own.

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,520
I mean, amongst a lot of other things, we get improved support for DirectX 9 through

18
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
12.

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,880
That's massive for the DECK.

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,320
Even more exciting, though, is support for Easy Anti-Cheat.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,040
Well, okay, at least of the game in question is enabled the Linux module.

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,320
But hey, it's possible at all now.

23
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,560
Also worth remarking on here is that the development team, well, they seem pretty darn pleased

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,000
with this release, and I think rightfully so.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,480
But the real question is, Chris, do you think you'll actually have Proton 7 when you get

26
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
your DECK?

27
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,240
Or are you going to have to update right out of the box?

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,440
Are those images already baked?

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,400
Stay tuned and find out.

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,080
Good news for those of you out there still racking and stacking, Gigabyte and Canonical

31
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:54,880
announced they'll be working together to certify Gigabyte server hardware for Ubuntu.

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,560
Now Gigabyte has already advertised Ubuntu Linux support on various workstations and

33
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:05,800
server motherboards because, well, of course Linux runs on that hardware, but they'll now

34
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:11,280
be moving forward with obtaining official certification from Canonical.

35
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,720
As part of that certification process, they'll be ensuring Gigabyte servers work on the two

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,160
most recent Ubuntu LTS versions, as well as making sure things work with Canonical's Metal

37
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,160
as a service.

38
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,040
Yeah, so it's not really clear here if all of Gigabyte server products are going to get

39
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,960
the certification treatment, but here's how you'll tell.

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:38,280
In the near future, you'll be able to find a section on Canonical's website that'll have

41
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,160
the Gigabyte certified servers listed, where you'll be able to just click a link and purchase

42
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
them.

43
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,760
So the models that do get certified by Canonical will be easy to find on Canonical's website,

44
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,760
so that works.

45
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,980
And this is really great to see, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, IBM, Huawei, Lenovo, and others.

46
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,160
They have done this in the past, so it's nice to have one more added to this list.

47
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,240
And also, if you're in Barcelona and you're going to Mobile World Congress 2022, Canonical

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
will be there.

49
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,600
They're going to demonstrate how to manage and operate distributed compute pools with

50
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,680
their open source solution.

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,800
And they have been going regularly since the Ubuntu Phone project.

52
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,160
In fact, the mobile industry kind of represents a decent portion of their client base, and

53
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:25,600
it made me realize looking at this, the fact that they're still going, I don't think that

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,560
time they spent on the Ubuntu Phone was necessarily wasted.

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,800
I think they invested in an industry that is continuing to pay dividends.

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:41,960
We've got a couple exciting updates that will be coming to a kernel near you pretty soon.

57
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,680
Let's start with our future workstation file system, at least we hope, BcacheFS.

58
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:54,320
BcacheFS has been in development since the mid-2010s, having evolved from the Bcache

59
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,440
module, which provides a block cache layer for the Linux kernel.

60
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,240
It aims for speed, while also having ButterFS-like features.

61
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,560
Say, for instance, snapshots, which were added fairly recently to the project.

62
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,040
It's been under pretty heavy development lately, which hasn't left a ton of time for project

63
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
updates.

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,400
But, this week, lead developer Kent Overstreet provided one of those, with a new posting

65
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,120
on the Linux kernel mailing list.

66
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,280
We'll have the full post linked if you're curious, but while we're speaking of snapshots,

67
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,400
he noted that, quote, I'm particularly proud of how snapshots turned out.

68
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,000
It's roughly a versioned B-tree approach, and it's scalable and fast.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,160
He also noted some nice consequences of that design, things like the file system repair

70
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
time.

71
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,040
Well, that doesn't depend on the number of snapshots, so it sounds like we can kind of

72
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,000
go crazy with them.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Snapshot with abandon!

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,960
He said that he had a VM that he had loaded up with a million snapshots, and performance

75
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,800
was still just fine.

76
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,160
He also recently noted, quote, things are in flux lately with all the allocator work,

77
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,760
but I'm hoping that once that settles down, and I've worked through the backlog of bug

78
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:17,440
reports and performance regressions, we might be ready for upstreaming sometime this year.

79
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,720
One more kernel update to look forward to, it seems that long-time Linux kernel developer

80
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,040
Jens Axbo is known for his IOMastery, maintaining the block subsystem, and developing features

81
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,240
you hear about on this show like IOU ring.

82
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,520
Well, recently, he picked up an Apple MacBook Pro with an M1 Pro inside, and jumped into

83
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,640
the nascent M1 Linux community.

84
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:48,560
After just a few days of tinkering, Axbo shared last week that he was, quote, very impressed

85
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,760
by the hardware, and has begun dabbling with CPU frequency tuning support for the Apple

86
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,840
M1, an effort that was started by Asahi Linux developer Hector Martin.

87
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:25,600
Hey, maybe by this time next year, I'll be running BcashFS on my M1 running Linux.

88
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,960
And a huge congratulations to everyone for the big news, Linode has been acquired by

89
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:35,280
Akamai, and that's 19 years of hard work that's getting paid off, and you could really see,

90
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,360
as they would put it, the synergy there with that acquisition.

91
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,200
Go try it out right now.

92
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,120
Maybe you want to build something yourself, maybe you want to take advantage of one of

93
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,160
their one-click deployments, and their super fast systems, their S3 compatible object storage,

94
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,080
their totally metal boxes if you like to go old school, they got it all.

95
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,040
And they got a great interface, and the absolute best customer support in the business.

96
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,280
From the support, to the super fast rigs, to the Linux culture that runs deep, I mean,

97
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,920
that's something I know about Linode.

98
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,400
I know they have a culture that's strong, and that runs deep.

99
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,480
There's a lot of reasons why I choose Linode, but you may come up with your own set of reasons.

100
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,160
So go try it yourself and get that experience, and go get that $100.

101
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,320
Go to linode.com slash LAN.

102
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,000
And a big thank you to Ting, linux.ting.com.

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,200
If you're sick of overpaying for cell service, go see how much you could save, and then take

104
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,320
25 bucks off that at linux.ting.com.

105
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,120
One of the things I hear all the time from my friends outside the US is Ting does mobile

106
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,600
how the rest of the world had to do it.

107
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,700
They came into mobile a little bit later than we did in the States, and we got these big

108
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,460
duopoly set up.

109
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,160
But in other parts of the world, the carriers actually have to be competitive with each

110
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,920
other, and they actually have to compete on things like value and customer service.

111
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,200
That's Ting, and that's what makes Ting great in the States.

112
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,440
They're a mobile virtual network operator.

113
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,200
They ride on top of those big coast-to-coast networks, but you interface with Ting, who's

114
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:13,280
nimble, who has great customer support, a fantastic deal, like seriously, they got a

115
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,680
plan for everybody, and no contracts ever.

116
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,800
I've been a customer since 2013, so I can tell you Ting is great.

117
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,520
I've stuck with them for the long haul, because it's just a smarter way to do mobile.

118
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,760
Every Ting plan gets access to their award-winning customer support.

119
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,760
In fact, Ting mobile was just recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports

120
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,760
in 2021.

121
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,160
You never have to worry about a contract.

122
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,000
It's super easy to get started.

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,040
Their website makes it really quick and fast and straightforward.

124
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,380
So go to linux.ting.com, check your current phone, create an account, and pick the plan

125
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,160
that's right for you.

126
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,600
Ting will send you a SIM card.

127
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,120
You pop that sucker into your phone, and guess what, you're going to get activated in minutes.

128
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,600
It can be in the middle of the night.

129
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,820
Everyone's asleep in your house, and you're getting everybody set up on better, smarter

130
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,820
mobile service.

131
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,820
That's what I did.

132
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:07,520
That's what you can do, linux.ting.com.

133
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:15,320
We saved our last story for one we've been waiting for since episode 168, way back on

134
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,680
December 20th, 2020.

135
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,680
As you might recall, if you can remember back that far, that's when Google acquired Neverware,

136
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:32,160
a company whose product made it possible to run Chrome OS on regular PCs.

137
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:40,360
Well, on Tuesday, Google announced its plans to release Chrome OS Flex, a product designed

138
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:47,960
to run on PCs and Macs as old as about 13 years.

139
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:54,800
What's really new about all this is probably just that running Chrome OS on non-Chromebook

140
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,400
hardware is now officially sanctioned by Google.

141
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:05,540
But before you get too excited, you should know that as of now, Chrome OS Flex does still

142
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:14,560
have some limitations, most significantly perhaps, Flex can't yet run Android applications.

143
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,240
But if you don't care about that, well, it's available right now as quote, early access.

144
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,200
So do set your expectations accordingly.

145
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,840
It probably won't be as stable as the full blown release coming in hopefully a few months.

146
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:35,200
Yeah, and with 13 years of general hardware support, you got a good shot here.

147
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:42,000
You need four gigs of RAM, you need an x86 64-bit CPU and a modest 16 gigs of disk.

148
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,600
There are some systems in the last 13 years that have come out, like specifically some

149
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,720
Atom boxes that are not supported.

150
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,080
That's all on Google's website here.

151
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,960
And Google does say, quote, components made before 2010 might result in a poor experience.

152
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,400
So you have that as well.

153
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,640
But you know, really, I think if you're going to want to get the best Google experience

154
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,840
and you know, if you're going to use this in an institution, you actually want hardware

155
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,560
and software support, you're ultimately going to still want to get something that's actually

156
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,080
been certified by Google, which at that point, you might as well get a Chromebook.

157
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,560
But I mean, I could see other reasons why you might not.

158
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,480
And Google is going to have a list of certified hardware models that they're going to test,

159
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,000
they're going to troubleshoot and they're going to optimize for and then they're going

160
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,360
to supposedly make it easy for you to find on their website.

161
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,720
But what I find fascinating about this is it seems like because if you look at their

162
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,840
specific BIOS support, they've they've made it really flexible.

163
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
Ha ha.

164
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:42,000
I just got maybe that's why they called it Chrome OS Flex, but they've made the BIOS

165
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,440
support really clever and flexible.

166
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:50,240
And so it's possible and people are speculating that you could install this on Chromebooks

167
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,560
that are past their built in expiration date that are no longer supported.

168
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,000
You could come along and put Chrome OS Flex on them and get a whole new life out of the

169
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,560
box potentially.

170
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
So we'll see.

171
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
We'll see.

172
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,920
But it does seem like we've been waiting for this one a little bit longer than we expected.

173
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,280
I think you and I both thought this would probably be announced in 2021.

174
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,360
Yeah, definitely.

175
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,440
It is still nice to see now, though, you know, we hem and haw about how we feel about Chrome

176
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
OS.

177
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Does it count as desktop Linux?

178
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,040
Does it make us uncomfortable?

179
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,640
But having an official version that you can just run on any old hardware, well, makes

180
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,240
it a little more approachable, at least to me.

181
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,980
And I imagine it might make it easier to use for schools that didn't already buy into the

182
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,760
whole Chromebook paradigm, right?

183
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,720
They've already got some hardware out there.

184
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,240
Yeah, and I think it's good anytime you can make it possible to easily reuse old hardware.

185
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:53,840
You know, why throw a PC out that's less than 13 years old and still works if you're at

186
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:56,160
a school or an institution?

187
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,240
If you know, I mean, a lot of us just need a web browser now.

188
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
That's just it.

189
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,400
Yeah, and I like it for that as well.

190
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:09,080
I think also the messaging around that has been interesting.

191
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,800
Google's kind of low key, making sure everyone understands that they've designed this to

192
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,000
also work on MacBooks.

193
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,500
I find that fascinating and perhaps appropriately timed because you're going to have organizations

194
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,920
and groups.

195
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,240
They're going to transition to the M1 or the Apple Silicon architecture and leave their

196
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,460
old Intel machines behind.

197
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,080
This could be one more thing you now do with those old Intel MacBooks, and I'm not thinking

198
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:42,080
like the most recent Intel MacBooks, but I'm thinking, you know, like the 2015s, the 2013s,

199
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,540
some of the older ones that are still perfectly good.

200
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,600
Maybe you could try putting this on there.

201
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,880
I will admit I'm pretty darn curious.

202
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,680
I'm also kind of curious if they've done any custom work to make this work and install

203
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,320
easily and well on Mac hardware.

204
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,560
I mean, I know older Macs now tend to have some decent kernel support, but it can still

205
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,560
be hit or miss.

206
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,200
Yeah, and that trackpad, that trackpad and that Wi-Fi and that webcam, that can be very

207
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
tricky.

208
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,800
But back on the main PC side, what do you think, Wes?

209
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,520
Does this mean that Google is now shipping a general PC Linux distro?

210
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:25,400
I mean, you can run it on just about any hardware now.

211
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:30,440
And you can run regular desktop Linux apps on it.

212
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,800
Yeah, and it's definitely more Linux than Android, that's for sure.

213
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,520
Yeah, I think I have to say, yes.

214
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,320
I mean, don't call it that and don't call it a PC maybe, but yeah, I mean, they've kind

215
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,360
of come at this in the same way Apple or a similar way that Apple has with the iPad OS

216
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
and rebuilding things up.

217
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,800
You know, they started with a very limited set of things you could do with this computer,

218
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,920
but at this point with Chrome OS, yeah, I think you have to say that it is.

219
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:05,360
Right, and in so many ways, Chrome OS is a more sensible architecture than Android.

220
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,800
And you know, you could see how you could eek more performance out of Chrome OS too.

221
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,200
We'll sit here and try to figure out what to call it and we'll let you know.

222
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,840
You just tune in every week and find out.
