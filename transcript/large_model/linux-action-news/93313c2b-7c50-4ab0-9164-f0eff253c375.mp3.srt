00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 189, recorded on May 15, 2021.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,600
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,600
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,600
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,800
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,440
Last week, we discussed Audacity's new management and their pull request adding telemetry to

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,440
the project.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,840
Well, this week, it seems they've reversed course.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,040
Plans to use Google Analytics and Yandex to track and analyze events within Audacity was

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,680
greeted with considerable alarm by the community.

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,400
The request itself is nearing 3,500 clicks of the thumbs down emoji as we record with

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,760
remarks such as it being, quote, a massive middle finger to the application's supporters,

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,480
capturing the strength of some community members' feelings.

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,560
And those are really just the people we heard from.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,920
Yeah, that's right.

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,520
Now, despite attempts to calm things down, new project lead Martin Curie, also known

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,280
as Tanta Cruel, posted yesterday that the plans as originally envisaged had been dropped.

18
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,840
Google and Yandex would not feature in the immediate future, and self-hosting would be

19
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,600
used for error reporting and update checks.

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,280
Curie described the original pull request as, quote, a bad communication slash coordination

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,300
blunder, saying that they were very sorry for causing so much alarm.

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,680
He went on to say the response to PR 835 has brought about a realization at Muse that the

23
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,880
convenience of using Yandex and Google is at odds with the public perception of trustworthiness,

24
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,480
so we will be self-hosting instead.

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,080
Curie goes on to say, it was a completely innocent mistake that ended up doing the announcing

26
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,640
for us in the worst way possible.

27
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,920
In other words, Wes, he's basically saying the problem was not the Google Analytics or

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,120
the Yandex tracking, but the fake news about adding Google Analytics and Yandex.

29
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, I'm not sure that response is really acknowledging that the root of the issue here

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,120
was the telemetry itself and not the communication, although I'm sure the project would have liked

31
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,980
to have more control over that communication in open source and in a project that's just

32
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,980
changed hands.

33
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,680
You've got to expect that APR is going to get some scrutiny.

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,160
Yeah, when you put it out there, we're all going to see it.

35
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,560
That's how it works in the free software world, and especially with the quintessential free

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,400
software audio editor.

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,880
Even with these changes, Curie remains keen on telemetry overall, hoping to be informed

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,800
about where time and effort could be and need to be invested in the project.

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,200
There have been a few options floated for going forward, including making an optional

40
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,120
add-on that users could elect to install, but that's all for the future to be decided.

41
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,060
I'll have to make do without telemetry for the time being.

42
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,720
Our next headline in news that you should know this week involves a story we've been

43
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:53,040
covering for a very long time on the show, and that is Google's slow cook of Fuchsia

44
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
OS.

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,320
Now, you might recall back in December, Google opened up Fuchsia to developers of all varieties

46
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,040
to contribute to the Fuchsia project, and we noted that moment right here on the show

47
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,840
because it really also was, it was a milestone in the sense that the project came out into

48
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,200
the limelight for the first time and Google started publicly talking about Fuchsia and

49
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,840
contributing to Fuchsia.

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,720
And having others use and contribute back up to Fuchsia certainly feels like a big milestone.

51
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,920
One big name that appears to be taking up Google's offer to contribute to the project

52
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,600
is Samsung.

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,440
Samsung has submitted a patch related to their flash friendly file system or F2FS, which

54
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,200
is an alternative file system designed and optimized specifically for flash storage,

55
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,560
such as say, I don't know, the built in storage of a smartphone.

56
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,280
Hmm, makes you wonder perhaps what Fuchsia just might be used for in the future.

57
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,320
More importantly, though, this isn't a lone Samsung employee contributing work to Fuchsia

58
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,760
in their own name.

59
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,920
No, now you'll find in the official author's file Samsung Inc. listed side by side with

60
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,440
Google LLC.

61
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,720
The Ubuntu Touch project is in the headlines this week because they released OTA 17 with

62
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,000
many improvements and the big headline feature is NFC hardware support, which is available

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,080
for all Android 9 compatible devices such as the Google Pixel 3a and the Volaphone.

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,200
And according to the UbiPorts project, NFC can now allow an app developer to implement

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,280
the ability to read and write NFC tags right in the app, as well as communicate with other

66
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,560
devices that support the NFC protocol.

67
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,140
And they've already whipped up a demo application to kind of show it all off.

68
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:35,240
That's not all though, in addition to NFC support, the Ubuntu Touch OTA 17 update adds

69
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,840
many improvements to the camera, things like flash, focus, rotation, and zoom on several

70
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,240
supported Ubuntu phone devices.

71
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,260
Under the hood, Ubuntu Touch OTA 17 is based on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, but as Dalton Durst told

72
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:56,080
us recently, the team is still working hard to rebase things over to Ubuntu 20.04.

73
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,720
And our last headline before we get to the discussion story this week is the framework

74
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,760
laptop we told you about a little while ago is now available for pre-order.

75
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,560
Now you may recall this is the repairable laptop that includes a series of modules you

76
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,820
can add, and they have a DIY kit that lets you run Linux and you assemble it and install

77
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,320
your own distribution.

78
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:20,000
Each laptop comes with four bays that are compatible with this expansion card system

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,520
that lets you select the ports via these exchangeable modules, so you have USB-C and A modules and

80
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,840
HDMI and DisplayPort and MicroSD, like all of these are different fast modules that are

81
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,940
using USB4 connectivity.

82
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,360
Things like storage and an extra battery can be plugged in or a gigabit Ethernet module,

83
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,000
which is also in the works.

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,120
The framework laptop is offered with pre-configured models running Windows 10 Home or Pro, but

85
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:52,560
the company also designed the DIY edition, which is sold as a kit to let people customize

86
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,920
and assemble the laptop and install a Linux distribution.

87
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,320
Currently there are three basic configurations, base, performance, and professional, ranging

88
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:07,540
from just under $1,000 to just under $2,000.

89
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:14,280
With hardware ranging from an Intel Core i5, 8 gigs of RAM and 256 gigs of NVMe storage,

90
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,400
up to a Core i7, 32 gigs of RAM and a terabyte of storage space.

91
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,800
As for the pre-order itself, Framework is only asking that users put down a $100 deposit,

92
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,400
fully refundable they say, with the first laptop set to ship at the end of July.

93
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,100
So far pre-orders are only available in the US, but Canada is promised in the next few

94
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,720
weeks, and availability in Europe and Asia set for later this year.

95
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,520
So Westpac, you're kind of in the laptop market.

96
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,800
I know you went and plugged into their configurator a machine that would be an ideal config for

97
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
you.

98
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,440
I'm curious what you spec'd and what the price came out to be.

99
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,840
Yeah, it was a fun little experiment.

100
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:01,000
It was just over two grand for an 11th Gen i7, the nicest one that they offered, 64 gigs

101
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,880
of RAM because, you know, you know I want to run a bunch of stuff in memory that I probably

102
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
shouldn't.

103
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
Like your entire OS.

104
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,440
Yeah, like that.

105
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,600
And I didn't want to go crazy with storage, still trying to keep it somewhat reasonable.

106
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,000
So I just chose the one terabyte SSD, but it was the fastest version that they had.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,160
You could go higher, but that's enough to start with.

108
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,360
I noticed though that this thing doesn't ship by default with a power adapter.

109
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,600
No, really following the trends there, aren't they?

110
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,740
Now it is just USB-C and they are very clear that you can go get one yourself and give

111
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,680
you some specs that might help you find it, or they've got a fancy one they've custom

112
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
engineered themselves.

113
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,240
Yeah, it's like 50 bucks.

114
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
It's not too bad.

115
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,920
Yeah, I figured I'd just get that because it's nice to have one by default and it's

116
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,400
not assigned, it's new, it's just for that laptop and I'd have to go buy one anyway.

117
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,760
When you were pricing this, did you select the DIY edition?

118
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,440
Yeah, you know I did.

119
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,960
And that was interesting because you both get to and have to kind of bring your own

120
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,960
connectivity.

121
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,240
Now, I guess in the future when there's third party modules, you could be, you know, might

122
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,480
have some already from a different laptop you want to plug and play, but I'm just getting

123
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,000
started as is this ecosystem.

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,920
So I needed to get some ports.

125
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,080
You mean like the DIY edition, it really is DIY, like there are no ports on this thing.

126
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,880
Yeah, that's why they say they, quote, recommend that you select for add-ons.

127
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,760
All right, well, so like, how much are these add-ons?

128
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
Not too bad.

129
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,260
USB-C and A ports are each $9.

130
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,720
Goes up a little bit though for fancier stuff like HDMI, DisplayPort, or MicroSD, which

131
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
are 19.

132
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,640
I could see having to pay $20 to have an HDMI port on your laptop being a turnoff, but then

133
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,320
perhaps those people would be better suited for one of the packaged models that includes

134
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
modules already.

135
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,920
Yeah, that very well could be the case.

136
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,880
And I could see this really shining for folks that wanted to buy a bunch of modules and

137
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,940
reconfigure things depending on different scenarios, or maybe you just have a weird

138
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,320
use case and you really want to use all of these with just USB-A.

139
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,520
So after your modules and your power supply, what was your grand total for your config?

140
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
2,176.

141
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,600
All right, all right.

142
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
That's not outrageous.

143
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,600
I mean, that's definitely not the best deal around, but I mean, what's the value of repairability?

144
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,280
And these modules, because they're using USB4, it's not like they're totally unique proprietary

145
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
to the framework.

146
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,920
I mean, I hate to say it, but they could kind of go away and you could maybe still wire

147
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
into that.

148
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,680
And then when you look at the internals of this thing, the disk and all that is just

149
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,800
standard components that are just totally accessible by end users, including the battery.

150
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,560
So what is the value of a laptop where you can replace the battery and the hard drive

151
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,560
and repair it?

152
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,940
I mean, it seems like maybe it's worth a slight premium.

153
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,940
What do you think?

154
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,940
Are you going to pull the trigger?

155
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,560
It seems like I think that's a good idea because I just did.

156
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Yeah.

157
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,040
There you go.

158
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,760
A live pre-order right here on the show.

159
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Well, we'll see what happens.

160
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
It's going to be interesting.

161
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Are you excited, Wes?

162
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,400
It feels like an opportunity to fall in love with a laptop, which I haven't done really

163
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,220
for a long time.

164
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
It is a little bit steep.

165
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,160
We'll see how that goes, but it's bucking a trend that just about no one else in the

166
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,300
industry is.

167
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,200
And I do like the idea of repairability and upgradability in a laptop that I control.

168
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,040
And I tend to do pretty odd projects here and there.

169
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,600
So it seems like a good fit.

170
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,640
We'll see how it works out.

171
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,980
Linode dot com slash LAN.

172
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:12,080
You go there to get one hundred dollars and sixty day credit towards a new account.

173
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,000
And of course, you support the show.

174
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,480
Linode is the largest independent cloud provider and they are our cloud provider.

175
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,120
That's where we host everything now.

176
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,160
I've been using it personally for a couple of years.

177
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,660
And when it was time to go independent again, we went with Linode and then after using it

178
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,240
for a while, I knew that they would make the perfect sponsor, because when I use a product

179
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,960
and I love it for reasons that I know will resonate with the audience, I think to myself

180
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,320
that has serious sponsor potential.

181
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,280
So I want you to go take advantage of this one hundred dollar credit because using Linode

182
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,340
is really what makes it click.

183
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,560
You'll see it's just a little bit nicer than the way everybody does their version of what

184
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,080
Linode started back in 2003.

185
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,000
They've been around forever and they have focused on this game.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,680
Their technology stack is top of the line.

187
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,960
Their systems are fast.

188
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,980
Their network connections are screaming and they've got 11 data centers around the world.

189
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,320
They also have hundreds of guides, tutorials to help you get started.

190
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:08,360
And you know, one of the things that I think is great about Linode that you appreciate

191
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,720
when you need it is their support.

192
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,980
And this is something that's really, really come in from our audience over time.

193
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,200
As we've had Linode now for a little while as a sponsor, we get feedback and over and

194
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,160
over again, I hear from you out there that say Linode's support is fantastic.

195
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,200
I got myself into a pickle, Chris, and Linode got me out of it.

196
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,520
By phone or ticket, they're going to give you the best support in the industry.

197
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,520
We use the heck out of their S3 compatible object storage.

198
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,160
That's something you could really look into to take advantage of just something that goes

199
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,960
beyond even just hosting.

200
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,020
It's something beyond just an average server.

201
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,020
It's object storage.

202
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,020
It's great.

203
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,020
You should go check it out.

204
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,440
They have a lot of stuff that you're going to take advantage of from five dollar rigs

205
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,640
to really super fast high end systems.

206
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
Go play around.

207
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
Go learn.

208
00:11:53,640 --> 00:12:00,280
Go try something out with that $100 60 day credit at Linode dot com slash land.

209
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,040
And a big thank you to Ting, Linux dot Ting dot com.

210
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,560
Ting's new set 12 plan will give you 12 gigs of data with unlimited talk and text for just

211
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,000
thirty five dollars a month.

212
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,120
They also have the perfect family plan.

213
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,640
And if you use two gigs or 20 gigs a month, Ting's going to have a plan that will work

214
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,080
just right for you.

215
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,620
You've really got access to three different networks that you can take advantage of.

216
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,240
That means a nationwide LTE and 5G coverage that's best in your area.

217
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,700
Plus the freedom of no contracts ever.

218
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,080
And the great thing about Ting is their customer support is also fantastic.

219
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,760
That's a big thing that I want nailed when we have a sponsor for you is I want them to

220
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,780
be able to take care of you guys long term.

221
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,960
And Ting is all about that.

222
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,140
That's been a major focus of their business.

223
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:50,520
So go to Linux dot Ting dot com and take $25 whatever plan you end up with, including their

224
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,840
$45 a month unlimited plan.

225
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,040
You take $25 off your first month when you go to Linux dot Ting dot com.

226
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,960
I've been a customer for about 500 years, I think.

227
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,280
I mean, I'm just I'm not great at math, but I think that's about it.

228
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,200
And I'll tell you one of the things that I appreciate the most is over the entire lifetime

229
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,080
that I've been a member of Ting, which has been years, honestly.

230
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,320
I've had to interact with the customer service twice because of a device issue.

231
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,080
And each time it was a great experience.

232
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,800
But all the other all the other stuff, moving devices, switching networks, activating a

233
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,080
new device, adding a family line, that's always been done through the Ting website.

234
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,540
They nail those tools.

235
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,080
They set that benchmark.

236
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,780
If you're not big on interacting with human support over the phone, you're going to find

237
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,200
their website really takes care of most your issues.

238
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,440
So check out Linux dot Ting dot com, take $25 off.

239
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,200
It's really simple to switch to Ting.

240
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,400
Just about every phone will work because they do support so many networks.

241
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,980
You go over to their website, you put in your phone information, and then when everything

242
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,360
checks out, Ting sends you a SIM card, you pop that in, you go to their website a little

243
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,480
bit later and you're good to go.

244
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,600
I mean, you're done.

245
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,840
You're talking like a half hour tops of investment here to save money every single month.

246
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,960
So go to Linux dot Ting dot com.

247
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:12,840
What you're hearing right now is System76's new launch keyboard in action with the Jade

248
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,040
switches.

249
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,240
Two sets of switches will be offered for this formally announced configurable mechanical

250
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
keyboard.

251
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,880
The second set, the Royal switches, are a little more muted.

252
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Yes, it's real.

253
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,160
It is actually real and pre-orders are starting now.

254
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,400
The compact, highly configurable mechanical keyboard is entirely open source, as we would

255
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,560
expect from System76.

256
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,160
The schematics, the chassis, even the firmware code is all freely available and there's tight

257
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,860
integration with Pop OS, but it also works with all Linux distros, Windows and Mac OS.

258
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,320
The device comes with extra sets of key caps, a key polar, a little bar to give you a little

259
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,240
bit of a raise, all those kinds of things in the box.

260
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,540
All the niceties you'd expect from a high end mechanical keyboard.

261
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:02,480
Something that really stands out about the launch is its use of a split space bar.

262
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,880
But yeah, not just one big space bar, but two separate keys.

263
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:13,120
This is a little bit unusual, but System76 has its reasons for doing so, namely that

264
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,200
their research reveals that most of us only use our right or left thumb for the space

265
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,480
bar, but rarely both.

266
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,200
So since there's half a key going to waste, you can swap it out for something you might

267
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,860
actually use.

268
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:33,560
The keyboard is also a USB hub with four USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, two of those being type A

269
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,800
and the other two type C.

270
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:41,480
And the other aspect of the launch will be the software that is a companion piece with

271
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
the keyboard.

272
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,620
It lets you switch between different keyboard mappings at the push of a button.

273
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,960
Anytime you want to switch a layout, you can hit a key on the keyboard or use the configuration

274
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,000
app to initiate the change.

275
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,360
And there will be four layers of key mappings that you can do to this.

276
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,160
And like they're doing with their new products, these are made in Denver, Colorado.

277
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,760
The cost will be $285 US greenbacks and the shipments will start early next month.

278
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,800
So those are the facts, but how are we feeling about it?

279
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,600
Well, my first thought is A, that's pretty pricey.

280
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,680
But B, just from looking at all the promotional material and hearing from folks from System76,

281
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,960
you can tell they've had a lot of fun and are really proud of this thing.

282
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,560
Yeah, there's a high end keyboard market, no doubt about it.

283
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,080
And I mean, because you can buy keyboards for $20.

284
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,080
The keyboard that I have right here in front of me, this was like $100 keyboard, you know,

285
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,400
and I think the most I've ever spent for a keyboard that is built for RSI, I think it

286
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,640
was $300.

287
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,840
The ultimate hacker keyboard, I think is around that price.

288
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:49,200
And this is offering pretty much everything that those keyboards offer, plus it's fully

289
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,040
open source, even the firmware, which a lot of them are now, but this is nice to see.

290
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,440
And it's built right here in the US of A. And for us Linux users, I'm going to like

291
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,040
the fact that it's using LVFS for future firmware updates on the keyboard.

292
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,040
I like that.

293
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,240
That means you might actually do those updates.

294
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,120
I think I definitely will.

295
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
So I did order one.

296
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,000
I asked for a review unit too, so that way I could get some time on it perhaps earlier.

297
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,840
But I ordered one because I like the idea of System76 getting into the accessory market.

298
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,360
They could sell 70% of these to Windows users for all I care about, you know, finance a

299
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,360
few Thalios.

300
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,360
Yeah, that's a good point.

301
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,820
This isn't really directed just at Linux users.

302
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,240
It's really anyone who likes a nice mechanical keyboard or who's really a power user and

303
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,840
might actually take advantage of all those layers.

304
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,040
I think there's also something pretty clever from a planning standpoint.

305
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,280
If they learn how to master this keyboard, that's going to become really, really useful.

306
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,200
And that's going to be a lot of lessons learned when it comes time to build a laptop.

307
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,480
And I think long term, if we want a vendor in this space who's shipping open source systems

308
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,520
from top to bottom, from the chassis to the software, I think you got to kind of vote

309
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,280
with your wallet a bit on this one, at least I'm going to.

310
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,080
But it struck me, you know, it's like I'm not going to buy three of these things.

311
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,520
I'm not going to deck out all my machines.

312
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,280
And I know it's easy for me to say.

313
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:14,280
I don't say this lightly at all, but what I would love to see is what kind of compromises

314
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,960
would they have to make to get a hundred dollar version?

315
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,360
Something where maybe if I'm ordering a workstation, I could throw this in the order and get a

316
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,880
nice keyboard with my workstation.

317
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:30,080
But you know, at $285, I don't know Wes, I'd almost probably rather spend that money on

318
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,840
storage or memory than a keyboard.

319
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,720
If I'm a typical user now, yeah.

320
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,640
If I know the value of a mechanical keyboard, like I have now learned in the more recent

321
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,640
in recent years.

322
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,320
But, you know, at $285, unless I really know that I like keyboards, it's a big ask.

323
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,320
I agree with you.

324
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,800
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

325
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,540
I might buy this for my, you know, software development workstation at home because I

326
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:57,560
want a nice keyboard, but I wouldn't just go adding it to any old random Thalia order.

327
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,560
Yeah.

328
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,800
And obviously some of this is going to come down to how it feels.

329
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,560
My philosophy, just super briefly, I've talked about it plenty on Coder Radio.

330
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,640
I'm touching my keyboard all day long.

331
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,820
I realized it's my hands are constantly on my keyboard.

332
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,340
It is my number one interface to my computer.

333
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,080
And I think I want it to be nice.

334
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,320
I want it to feel good.

335
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,880
I want it to sound good.

336
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,180
I want to have a nice experience when I interact with it because I'm interacting with it for

337
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,800
God knows how many hours a week.

338
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,720
Having an integrated hub could be pretty handy as well.

339
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,400
I think in some keyboards, that's kind of a bonus feature just sort of thrown in as

340
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:38,600
an afterthought, but having USB-C and USB-A makes me think it could be a great addition.

341
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,500
Maybe you're using this keyboard at a mobile station where you just dock your laptop up

342
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,800
in there and now you've got a few extra boards.

343
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Yeah.

344
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,920
You mentioned also the developer aspect of being able to program the keys and things

345
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,240
like that is pretty useful, but I think there could also be a use case for us in the studio

346
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,760
when we're interacting with Reaper, our audio editor.

347
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,380
You could potentially add like, you know, with Reaper you can set macros and actions

348
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,400
that are a key combo that kick off a whole series of stuff.

349
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,980
You could map that to some buttons on the launch and we could be flying through Reaper

350
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,980
with our edit.

351
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,880
That is a great idea.

352
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,400
And you know that configuration tool, it's written in Rust.

353
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
It is.

354
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,080
And then you know what else is nice is that when you're done with the configuration tool,

355
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,220
which looks really nice from the videos, we haven't tried it yet, but the videos make

356
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,340
it look really simple and obvious to use.

357
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,680
And then when you're done and you hit save, it actually writes that back to the keyboard

358
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
firmware.

359
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,880
You can pick the old keyboard up and go plug it into a different machine and all your mappings

360
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
are still there.

361
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,440
That's definitely a nice feature and one of those features you see on higher end keyboards.

362
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,760
I don't think it's unique to System76 and that's true for a lot of the nice features

363
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,760
on here.

364
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,160
What I'm not so sure about is how big of a market for a keyboard this expensive is there?

365
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,360
How much room in the market for System76 is there?

366
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,440
And how good of a job are they going to be advertising outside of their main niche, which

367
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,740
is frankly us.

368
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:02,640
But there's a lot more mechanical keyboard users than people who are really focused on

369
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
desktop Linux.

370
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,640
Yeah, absolutely.

371
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,640
That's a good point.

372
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,820
I think the question you laid out there is how big is this market?

373
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,200
We absolutely know there is a high end keyboard market.

374
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,440
We've got a couple here in the studio and I pre-ordered one of these launches.

375
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,280
So yes, it's a market that's obvious.

376
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,720
How big though?

377
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,400
How big is a $300 ish keyboard market?

378
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:31,760
And I almost wonder if it doesn't really matter if it's that big or not, because as a company,

379
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,040
it's not like they're necessarily ready today to take tens of thousands of orders and start

380
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,120
cranking these things out by the tens of thousands, right?

381
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,320
I mean, it's a brand new product.

382
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,320
And as a business, they have to learn the process and procedures for procurement of

383
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,400
the parts, for assembling and building it, for packaging it up and shipping it.

384
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,280
And all of that is still new to them.

385
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,080
And they probably, a slow ramp up would probably be ideal.

386
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,480
I mean, I assume it's still new because we don't have review units.

387
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,840
And if they could, they'd like to get review units out when the products announced so that

388
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,080
way people can get information out there.

389
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,480
And I get the sense it's a ramp up, Wes.

390
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:13,280
And maybe a small market at a higher price point is a way to kind of cap how many orders

391
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,360
come in.

392
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,800
And then as you learn this thing and you don't really have to iterate much, so your initial

393
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:24,720
R&D investment kind of starts to get paid off, maybe the price comes down 50 bucks or

394
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,800
so in a year or maybe comes down 85 bucks in a year.

395
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,680
I mean, maybe as time goes on and they don't have to redo this thing because a keyboard

396
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,680
lasts for a long time, they recoup some of that initial cost, the price comes down a

397
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,940
little bit and it kind of ends up in that sweet spot, Wes, where it's at a great price

398
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,760
point and there's tons of people that are willing to pay that price and then it just

399
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,560
takes off like gangbusters.

400
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,880
And the reputation of it just sells itself.

401
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,200
Yeah, I mean, it could go that way.

402
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,720
I do think you've hit on some things though that this is going to be a learning experience

403
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,740
for them, which is good as they continue to develop their hardware and they've already

404
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,940
got some selection of manufacturing equipment in process and they'll be adding some things

405
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,800
that they'll learn with this new development.

406
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,200
So even if it isn't gangbusters, as long as they earn some money to recoup that expense,

407
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,280
seems like it's really an investment in the future.

408
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,800
But it sounds like you're kind of falling down on the side of you think it's probably

409
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,600
going to remain kind of a niche product.

410
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,860
Yeah, that's what I suspect, at least until they've got something a little further down

411
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,440
the product line that you could actually just sell, you know, with most of the items that

412
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
you ship.

413
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,920
I want to know when they're going to make the system 76 mouse now.

414
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Or maybe like a launch keyboard, like accessory that like snaps on and has all these extra

415
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,040
buttons.

416
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,480
What about a 6k system 76 monitor at your desk?

417
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
Yeah, there you go.

418
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,000
Yeah, and maybe they could build that into the keyboard.

419
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,680
I mean, I'm just spitballing here.

420
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,040
We can take these ideas and run with it.

421
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
We're just the idea guys, right?

422
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,560
And we're totally happy to be compensated in mechanical keyboards.

423
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,800
Yeah, we'll let you know if that ever happens.
