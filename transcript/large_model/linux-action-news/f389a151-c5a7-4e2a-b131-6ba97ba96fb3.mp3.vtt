00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

00:05.200 --> 00:09.360
Episode 124, recorded on September 22nd, 2019.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.360
I'm Chris.

00:10.360 --> 00:11.360
And I'm Joe.

00:11.360 --> 00:12.360
Hello, Joe.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.360
Good to be connected with you.

00:13.360 --> 00:16.280
And we start things off with some surprising news.

00:16.280 --> 00:20.840
Richard Stallman has resigned from the FSF as well as from MIT.

00:20.840 --> 00:25.640
Yeah, this was brewing for a good few days before Stallman actually resigned.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.580
And that happened last Monday.

00:27.580 --> 00:31.620
So it's kind of not exactly new news at this point.

00:31.620 --> 00:34.060
And you guys did cover it on Linux Unplugged 3.19.

00:34.060 --> 00:38.320
So we probably don't need to go into a huge amount of detail here.

00:38.320 --> 00:43.240
But suffice to say, things finally caught up with Stallman.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.240
Right.

00:44.240 --> 00:48.360
My thinking on this is it isn't this one incident.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.400
And I really liked the post.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.880
I'll try to put a link in the show notes that Thomas Bushnell did on Medium.

00:53.880 --> 00:57.680
He was, by his reckoning, and I think I agree, probably one of the developers that has worked

00:57.680 --> 01:00.440
with RMS the longest.

01:00.440 --> 01:04.480
And I think we have to acknowledge there was some bad reporting that happened here.

01:04.480 --> 01:05.480
Absolutely.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.240
There wasn't a concise, complete quote.

01:07.240 --> 01:09.240
It was taken out of context.

01:09.240 --> 01:14.320
However, truthfully, RMS has had plenty of opportunities to learn how to shut up when

01:14.320 --> 01:17.920
it's necessary and hold his tongue.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.280
And maybe that shouldn't be the reality of the world.

01:20.280 --> 01:23.120
But that is, especially when somebody has the viewpoints of Richard Stallman, when he

01:23.120 --> 01:29.400
has the leadership position that he does, he's responsible for relying too much on people's

01:29.400 --> 01:32.880
careful reading of his notes.

01:32.880 --> 01:38.120
He often, often has the defense, well, if you would carefully read what I said.

01:38.120 --> 01:44.120
He's relied on that careful interpretation of a controversial stance for a very long

01:44.120 --> 01:45.120
time.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.080
And it isn't this one slightly misquoted incident.

01:48.080 --> 01:54.880
It is a legacy of issues that even this individual, Thomas, who worked with RMS points out, it's

01:54.880 --> 01:56.460
a larger problem.

01:56.460 --> 02:01.000
And it wasn't that RMS was necessarily defending one individual.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.600
It was interjected in a bigger, more important conversation about how to come to terms with

02:06.600 --> 02:11.680
a history of MIT's institutional neglect of its responsibilities towards women and other

02:11.680 --> 02:15.040
groups and their complicity with Ipstein.

02:15.040 --> 02:20.520
That was the larger conversation, RMS derailed it with his comments that weren't really necessary.

02:20.520 --> 02:24.400
And they were joking in that thread about how this was all going to go public.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.120
So we better be careful with what we say.

02:26.120 --> 02:30.480
And we've been having a laugh at his expense with the clips and everything that you used

02:30.480 --> 02:31.480
to play on lap.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.920
But really, we should have been doing more than that.

02:33.920 --> 02:38.320
We've known for a long time that he's had these views that are just abhorrent and just

02:38.320 --> 02:40.360
too simplistic.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.340
And I think that we as a community should have done more.

02:43.340 --> 02:47.180
And I think that the FSF should have done more, MIT should have done more.

02:47.180 --> 02:53.360
And it shouldn't have got to this point where it's blowing up in this massive controversy.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.720
It should have been dealt with a long time ago.

02:55.720 --> 03:01.400
There should have been policy in place that stopped him being in charge for this long.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.120
I want to make a couple of things clear.

03:03.120 --> 03:07.040
I think, I agree, there probably should have been more that was done.

03:07.040 --> 03:14.360
I think, and I'm not defending anyone here, but I think there's a bigger issue at play.

03:14.360 --> 03:19.480
And it's a massive elephant in the room that we get close to talking about when we talk

03:19.480 --> 03:24.080
about Linus and his outbursts, and when we talk about Richard Stallman and his behavior,

03:24.080 --> 03:25.680
but we dance around it.

03:25.680 --> 03:30.200
And it is that our community is packed full of neurodiversity.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.520
We have people that are all over the place.

03:33.520 --> 03:37.600
And that's part of why we have so many brilliant people in the open source and free software

03:37.600 --> 03:38.600
community.

03:38.600 --> 03:43.000
They're gifted, but they also see the world differently in some cases.

03:43.000 --> 03:47.320
And I normally wouldn't say something like this on air, but I've been a part of this

03:47.320 --> 03:54.120
community for over a decade, and I have met thousands of people in person.

03:54.120 --> 03:58.040
And I've interviewed hundreds of developers.

03:58.040 --> 04:02.460
And I can tell you that this is a observation I have made myself.

04:02.460 --> 04:06.760
We have a bunch of really gifted people in our community, but that means sometimes they

04:06.760 --> 04:10.000
behave different than what people consider the norm.

04:10.000 --> 04:15.280
I think, in my personal opinion, most of us in the community kind of know this.

04:15.280 --> 04:19.040
And so sometimes we've made allowances for behavior that wouldn't normally be considered

04:19.040 --> 04:20.040
okay.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.960
And I think maybe we've made a mistake there.

04:22.960 --> 04:28.720
And by Richard taking this step himself, he's taken action before it got really, really

04:28.720 --> 04:29.720
nasty.

04:29.720 --> 04:34.240
And I think he's preserving the Free Software Foundation and the movement by doing this.

04:34.240 --> 04:39.240
I think we'll look back with some history and some perspective, and we'll appreciate

04:39.240 --> 04:41.000
the technical work that he did still.

04:41.000 --> 04:46.160
And I think that's another thing that got him as much leverage and mileage is the technical

04:46.160 --> 04:52.080
contributions both in code, but also in licensing and in free software.

04:52.080 --> 04:55.720
And that sort of gave him a special treatment.

04:55.720 --> 05:01.440
But by Richard Stallman moving aside, it means that we can also deal with other leaders that

05:01.440 --> 05:03.280
also exhibit these sort of similar behaviors.

05:03.280 --> 05:09.580
If he remained in place, it's sort of sending a signal that we allow that kind of behavior.

05:09.580 --> 05:15.280
And so by RMS stepping aside, it sends a signal that if you're in a position of leadership,

05:15.280 --> 05:20.040
especially a significant position of leadership, you're held to a high standard.

05:20.040 --> 05:23.240
And we will actually make sure that you meet that high standard.

05:23.240 --> 05:29.760
This is a bit of a, I think, a growing up for free software and for open source.

05:29.760 --> 05:38.000
It's sort of a transition away from outbursts and certain types of thinking to a more mature

05:38.000 --> 05:39.300
and modern.

05:39.300 --> 05:42.640
And those kinds of transitions always end up leaving people behind.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.720
And the people that get left behind generally are very upset.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.440
But ultimately, it needs to happen.

05:47.440 --> 05:53.520
And we've seen two very different things happen there, first with Linus Torvalds, who got

05:53.520 --> 05:58.180
called out for some behavior that he'd been exhibiting.

05:58.180 --> 06:04.800
And he took a step back, went away, and has come back now and has sorted himself out and

06:04.800 --> 06:09.120
is still happily at the helm of Linux and everything's going fine.

06:09.120 --> 06:11.280
So far, the kernel still seems to be pretty great.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.760
Although I did have some issues with 5.2, I gotta say.

06:13.760 --> 06:17.200
Well, yeah, that aside, the quality has been maintained.

06:17.200 --> 06:21.560
And just because he's changed his management style doesn't mean that anything has changed

06:21.560 --> 06:23.640
significantly technically.

06:23.640 --> 06:30.800
Whereas Stormon is such a stubborn man, that people have tried to make him change and you

06:30.800 --> 06:36.120
know, the whole insistence on calling it GNU slash Linux and all of that, he's just stuck

06:36.120 --> 06:40.440
to his guns so much that he just cannot change, it seems.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.680
And the world has changed and he's been left behind.

06:43.680 --> 06:48.280
And he's been irrelevant as far as I'm concerned for a very, very long time now.

06:48.280 --> 06:54.800
And I'm sort of glad, you know, put all of the controversy aside just from him as a man

06:54.800 --> 06:57.960
and as a figurehead for the free software movement.

06:57.960 --> 07:01.800
I'm very glad that he's now not going to be that figurehead anymore.

07:01.800 --> 07:04.120
I wouldn't attribute feeling glad to this.

07:04.120 --> 07:08.360
I think I recognize it was a necessity for the long term survival of the Free Software

07:08.360 --> 07:14.920
Foundation, and MIT probably need to distance from as much of the scandal as they can.

07:14.920 --> 07:18.560
But I don't really know what his involvement with GNU is going forward.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.120
And he's still going to have quite a following, regardless of what people's opinions out there

07:22.120 --> 07:26.480
might be, there will be people that continue to follow Richard Stallman, and he likely

07:26.480 --> 07:31.620
could still get a pretty decent appearance fee to go to events.

07:31.620 --> 07:35.280
After some time has passed, he may continue to talk about these issues, but now do so

07:35.280 --> 07:38.640
without risking the Free Software Foundation.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.920
Or perhaps he'll take this opportunity to retire.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.640
Well, I do hope he retires, I think it's the right thing to do.

07:43.640 --> 07:47.800
But I suspect you're right, and he will be back and we will hear more from him soon.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.800
Right.

07:48.800 --> 07:49.800
Time will tell.

07:49.800 --> 07:50.800
Probably going to need a little bit of time.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.240
People are still very upset.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.080
It needs a cooling off period.

07:55.080 --> 07:58.080
There's a larger conversation we need to have about neurodiversity.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.860
That's my personal cause.

07:59.860 --> 08:01.680
But I think now is not the right time to have it.

08:01.680 --> 08:05.560
Right now, we need to respect that certain boundaries were crossed and let those people

08:05.560 --> 08:07.600
have time.

08:07.600 --> 08:12.920
And these other issues like what happens to RMS and the bigger conversation, we'll get

08:12.920 --> 08:13.920
to.

08:13.920 --> 08:17.400
When you think of diversity, though, you don't normally think of a knit system diversity,

08:17.400 --> 08:21.660
but that is the very topic that the Debian project is struggling with.

08:21.660 --> 08:26.740
And it all stems from what seems like a rather minor package in the grand scheme of things,

08:26.740 --> 08:29.840
but the knock on effects of a decision could be massive.

08:29.840 --> 08:37.880
Yeah, and that package is E login D. And this has reignited the system D debate in Debian,

08:37.880 --> 08:41.320
which I thought was totally over, but apparently not.

08:41.320 --> 08:47.920
Because when Debian adopted system D, they didn't completely drop support for other init

08:47.920 --> 08:52.820
systems, but they just focused on system D. And a big part of the debate at the time leading

08:52.820 --> 08:58.560
up to that decision was people saying that if you adopt system D, then you're going to

08:58.560 --> 09:02.740
become completely dependent on it, and other things will just break.

09:02.740 --> 09:07.800
And it seems that they were right, because now we're getting to a situation where things

09:07.800 --> 09:13.520
are breaking, and a decision is probably going to have to be made here where either they

09:13.520 --> 09:20.860
really focus on other init systems and making them work properly, or we can have a situation

09:20.860 --> 09:25.760
where Debian is no longer the universal operating system and ports like, you know, BSD slash

09:25.760 --> 09:30.160
Debian are just going to stop working and potentially go away.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.160
Yeah, that's it.

09:31.160 --> 09:34.120
And this issue has come to a head in such that Sam Hartman, the Debian project lead,

09:34.120 --> 09:39.120
has had to step in and kind of set a state of where things are at in a public way, and

09:39.120 --> 09:41.940
then ask for people to contribute to the conversation.

09:41.940 --> 09:43.120
But a little bit of context here.

09:43.120 --> 09:49.000
So the reason why E login D kicked off this whole wider conversation about staying diverse

09:49.000 --> 09:54.360
with the init system or 100% focusing on system D is because E login D attempts to provide

09:54.360 --> 10:01.360
an implementation of services needed by common desktops for system D login D. So your desktop

10:01.360 --> 10:06.140
environments that require system D will still work and let you log in even if you don't

10:06.140 --> 10:10.520
have system D. This thing kind of sits in there and pretends to be that system D layer.

10:10.520 --> 10:15.480
Now it has a lot of complexities, including package conflicts and other changes in future

10:15.480 --> 10:17.960
versions of Debian that we'll need addressing.

10:17.960 --> 10:21.280
And so the maintainers have sort of come to loggerheads on this problem.

10:21.280 --> 10:25.160
I'm summarizing, we'll have a full link in the show notes at linuxactionnews.com slash

10:25.160 --> 10:27.280
124.

10:27.280 --> 10:33.480
But Sam says the reason why the Debian project lead is stepping in is because the developers

10:33.480 --> 10:38.560
have essentially exhausted themselves emotionally on this after years of complex interactions

10:38.560 --> 10:40.600
and considerations.

10:40.600 --> 10:44.160
You have an issue where people are emotionally exhausted.

10:44.160 --> 10:50.040
And so that's resulting in these technical issues, which are holding up this larger conversation.

10:50.040 --> 10:57.000
And of course, let's not forget the large dev1 shaped elephant in this room, dev1 forked

10:57.000 --> 10:59.880
from Debian when the system D decision was made.

10:59.880 --> 11:04.400
And the whole raison d'etre of dev1 is to maintain init diversity.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.800
Yeah, yeah, I was thinking that same thing.

11:07.800 --> 11:14.540
So what it really comes down to is, in a lot of ways, dropping E login D is this massive

11:14.540 --> 11:20.620
decision because it's sort of a knock on effect of becoming a system D only distribution.

11:20.620 --> 11:24.400
But if you want to maintain init diversity, then you're going to need a whole bunch of

11:24.400 --> 11:29.480
maintainers to step up to keep all of this stuff working in future versions of Debian.

11:29.480 --> 11:33.720
And you're going to need maintainers to work together, which currently they've sort of

11:33.720 --> 11:35.280
stopped doing that.

11:35.280 --> 11:39.200
So it really comes down to a pretty essential decision for the project.

11:39.200 --> 11:43.000
And it shows that once you thought something was settled in a setup like Debian, it doesn't

11:43.000 --> 11:44.720
necessarily mean it's settled forever.

11:44.720 --> 11:48.520
But surely that's a good thing that you don't just make a decision and stick blindly to

11:48.520 --> 11:52.080
it if it looks like it may have been the wrong decision.

11:52.080 --> 11:57.040
And I think that Sam is going about this the right way, bringing this up as a topic that

11:57.040 --> 12:01.960
needs to be discussed and trying to kickstart that discussion and potentially having all

12:01.960 --> 12:04.920
the devs have their say in a general resolution.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.440
Well wouldn't that be a fascinating process to watch?

12:07.440 --> 12:08.880
Keep my eye out for that.

12:08.880 --> 12:13.440
In the meantime, the rest of the systemd using world is moving forward with potentially a

12:13.440 --> 12:15.960
radical new concept.

12:15.960 --> 12:21.760
First he came for your audio subsystem, then he came for your init system, and now that

12:21.760 --> 12:24.760
crazy Lenart's coming for your home directory.

12:24.760 --> 12:25.760
And I think I like it.

12:25.760 --> 12:30.120
Yeah, let's not forget that he also came for containers as well, systemd containerd, which

12:30.120 --> 12:32.480
is still being worked on.

12:32.480 --> 12:38.680
So systemd homed, this is Lenart's crazy new idea, whereby your home directory is going

12:38.680 --> 12:40.320
to be a file.

12:40.320 --> 12:43.800
No, a file on a Linux system?

12:43.800 --> 12:44.800
Never heard of such a thing.

12:44.800 --> 12:50.600
I want to make it clear that he's only talking about human user accounts, not the system

12:50.600 --> 12:51.600
accounts.

12:51.600 --> 12:55.380
There's a lot to this, but it's kind of brilliant.

12:55.380 --> 13:00.480
When you look at a lot of the traditional problems of user management on a Linux system,

13:00.480 --> 13:04.840
they start to get a lot more complicated when you have 5, 10, 15 systems, and when you need

13:04.840 --> 13:09.960
to share files like NFS mounts and whatnot amongst these systems.

13:09.960 --> 13:14.640
And there really hasn't been much change in the last 39 years around the concept of a

13:14.640 --> 13:16.520
Unix home directory.

13:16.520 --> 13:22.160
So systemd homed is a concept that reworks how home directories work in Linux.

13:22.160 --> 13:27.440
And it's, at least in his recommendation, using strong Lux encryption by default, automatic

13:27.440 --> 13:32.160
enumeration of UIDs, and hot, pluggable home directories, Joe.

13:32.160 --> 13:33.520
How do you like them, Apples?

13:33.520 --> 13:39.660
It's as if he's taken a look at how home directories work and just said, let's scrap that completely,

13:39.660 --> 13:46.080
and let's design it as it should be for the 21st century, for 2019 into 2020.

13:46.080 --> 13:49.700
He has a really good talk on this, which we have linked in the show notes.

13:49.700 --> 13:52.120
And keep in mind, this is all early days.

13:52.120 --> 13:56.080
And I'll also add right here towards the front, one of the goals of this new system would

13:56.080 --> 14:01.600
be total compatibility with the old way of doing home directories and user accounts.

14:01.600 --> 14:05.080
Here's a high level idea, though, of how it works.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.880
Everything is contained in the home directory.

14:06.880 --> 14:11.240
If a home directory exists on the system, the user exists.

14:11.240 --> 14:16.080
So by laying out home folders with all of this information in a JSON format in the home

14:16.080 --> 14:21.620
directory, it describes everything about the user's security and configuration to the host

14:21.620 --> 14:23.080
operating system.

14:23.080 --> 14:30.040
What Lenart is proposing here is that we separate user configuration from system configuration.

14:30.040 --> 14:35.680
The user is a file, and changing system settings is separate from changing a user password

14:35.680 --> 14:40.360
or moving their home directory or enabling or disabling a user account.

14:40.360 --> 14:44.480
That's user level configuration stuff, not system configuration stuff.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.380
So you break the two apart.

14:46.380 --> 14:50.540
You use Lux encryption, and you tie that to the user's password.

14:50.540 --> 14:54.680
So on a shared system, instead of having one password that everybody has to know, your

14:54.680 --> 15:02.160
home directory is encrypted to your user password, which will break a few things, like SSH logins,

15:02.160 --> 15:03.880
but proposes much better security.

15:03.880 --> 15:08.880
Because this was an issue my wife has at her clinic, is they have to share the encryption

15:08.880 --> 15:11.280
password amongst all of the staff at the clinic.

15:11.280 --> 15:14.460
And then they have a separate password to log in, and then they have separate passwords

15:14.460 --> 15:15.920
for the services.

15:15.920 --> 15:20.240
It's a little bit over complex, and it seems a little backwards to share the encryption

15:20.240 --> 15:22.120
password with everybody.

15:22.120 --> 15:27.560
Then another issue, this is the last kind of key point, is this will solve a major security

15:27.560 --> 15:29.420
issue on laptops.

15:29.420 --> 15:34.060
And that is quite simply, when you log into your system and you have your drive unencrypted,

15:34.060 --> 15:38.180
if you have a Lux encrypted home drive, like I have my Lux, my home partitions completely

15:38.180 --> 15:39.180
Lux encrypted.

15:39.180 --> 15:43.160
I enter a password before the system gets too far into booting, and then it mounts my

15:43.160 --> 15:45.960
main disk and everything works.

15:45.960 --> 15:51.800
However, when I put my laptop to sleep, which is pretty much what I do all the time, that

15:51.800 --> 15:54.160
data remains unencrypted.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.660
The encryption key is stored in memory.

15:56.660 --> 16:00.720
It's open on the disk, and if somebody grabs your laptop while it's sleeping, that data

16:00.720 --> 16:01.720
is unencrypted.

16:01.720 --> 16:06.060
And now they have physical access to your laptop with the data unencrypted.

16:06.060 --> 16:07.960
This system would change that.

16:07.960 --> 16:14.860
Because it would be tied to the user's password, systemd homed would remove the key from memory

16:14.860 --> 16:18.580
when you suspend or lock the laptop or desktop.

16:18.580 --> 16:23.880
From a technical point of view, this sounds very impressive, but it is divisive, because

16:23.880 --> 16:27.520
you can't just go and change something that's been around for the best part of 40 years

16:27.520 --> 16:28.520
without controversy.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.520
Right?

16:29.520 --> 16:31.200
I mean, that's just inevitable.

16:31.200 --> 16:37.520
And from the reaction that I've seen so far, it seems to be basically a 50-50 split between

16:37.520 --> 16:45.760
people who think, great, this is an amazing, new, modern approach to home directories.

16:45.760 --> 16:49.440
And then the other 50% of people think, no, this is terrible.

16:49.440 --> 16:51.160
It's been fine for 40 years.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.780
Let's just leave it as is, please.

16:52.780 --> 16:56.860
I think you've got to cut out all of the knee-jerk reactions that just say, oh, here's systemd

16:56.860 --> 16:58.260
doing another thing.

16:58.260 --> 17:02.400
Because like many things with systemd, that's not really fair.

17:02.400 --> 17:07.080
Systemd is kind of like the API that lets you address this stuff, but he's just basically

17:07.080 --> 17:14.040
using Lux and PAM and all of the tools we already have to provide the functionality.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.040
So there's that aspect.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.300
But you've got to kind of ignore all the people that are like, oh, systemd gets even bigger.

17:18.300 --> 17:21.480
Because it's really just pulling together a bunch of existing tools.

17:21.480 --> 17:23.760
And that's just really the reality of it.

17:23.760 --> 17:26.120
That's the case for a lot of things systemd does.

17:26.120 --> 17:27.480
Here's the other thing.

17:27.480 --> 17:32.800
Those people haven't had to manage dozens or hundreds of Linux and Unix systems.

17:32.800 --> 17:36.720
It is at a whole other scale when you have to hack together some sort of centralized

17:36.720 --> 17:38.080
LDAP system.

17:38.080 --> 17:42.180
Or what I see most shops doing now is just marrying themselves to Active Directory and

17:42.180 --> 17:43.560
just saying, you know what?

17:43.560 --> 17:46.280
When it comes to our authentication, we're just going with Microsoft.

17:46.280 --> 17:49.600
I am shocked at how prevalent that is.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.640
Recently I've just been exposed to that just recently.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.860
And I was shocked that that's such a common thing.

17:53.860 --> 17:55.520
Because it's just solved.

17:55.520 --> 17:56.960
It's easy to get it working with Linux.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.560
You get central authentication.

17:58.560 --> 18:03.240
You get the same common UIDs across all of the systems, which makes file permissions

18:03.240 --> 18:04.440
work.

18:04.440 --> 18:07.240
And it's easier to do deployments that way.

18:07.240 --> 18:12.880
This is really about making this a configurable thing that can be managed, where you can query

18:12.880 --> 18:14.800
user records.

18:14.800 --> 18:19.400
You'll be able to entirely encapsulate a home directory on a thumb drive.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.760
You take that thumb drive.

18:20.760 --> 18:21.880
You sit down at a laptop.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.460
You plug it in.

18:23.460 --> 18:26.240
You now become a user on that system.

18:26.240 --> 18:29.240
And everything is in that contained environment.

18:29.240 --> 18:32.200
Your configuration, your authentication, your UID.

18:32.200 --> 18:36.860
It can automatically translate to another UID on the system if that's already taken.

18:36.860 --> 18:37.860
It's really smooth.

18:37.860 --> 18:40.560
And then when you're done, you pop that thumb drive out.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.080
Everything about that user is gone.

18:42.080 --> 18:46.180
And something else I know a lot of our audience will appreciate is they're going for day one

18:46.180 --> 18:51.800
YubiKey support for this, which is really kind of any PKCS 11 token device.

18:51.800 --> 18:56.160
Not just the YubiKey, but sort of generally using the YubiKey as a term there on day one,

18:56.160 --> 19:00.480
which I think would be a huge addition for Linux.

19:00.480 --> 19:03.160
One other thing, Joe, is this needs to happen now.

19:03.160 --> 19:05.800
Because if you look at different systems, they're already kind of...

19:05.800 --> 19:06.800
It's a mishmash.

19:06.800 --> 19:12.200
Like you have all of these strapped on ancillary systems, or you have like SSH keys which completely

19:12.200 --> 19:14.720
do a bypass on this system.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.720
It's kind of a...

19:15.720 --> 19:16.720
It's a mess right now.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.720
I don't know.

19:17.720 --> 19:18.720
I really...

19:18.720 --> 19:21.640
I guess the more I try to convince you, the more I'm convincing myself that this is kind

19:21.640 --> 19:22.640
of...

19:22.640 --> 19:28.120
This would be the most modern way to manage home directories in operating systems.

19:28.120 --> 19:29.120
This is really fresh.

19:29.120 --> 19:32.000
And I don't know if he's gotten a few ideas from other projects that I'm not familiar

19:32.000 --> 19:37.400
with, but he's addressing several security issues as well as making it easier to centrally

19:37.400 --> 19:41.640
manage and give people true portability between machines.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.120
I like how you just assume that I'm against this.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.600
Well, you were skeptical, I think.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.000
And now I'm just getting more into it.

19:47.000 --> 19:50.200
The more I think about it, I'm like, this would be pretty cool if Linux was the OS to

19:50.200 --> 19:51.960
pull this off before anybody else.

19:51.960 --> 19:53.120
Yeah, that would be cool.

19:53.120 --> 19:58.480
I think that not making it the only way, not making it mandatory, I think that has to be

19:58.480 --> 19:59.480
key here.

19:59.480 --> 20:03.040
And it looks like that is going to be the case at least for now.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.160
And I suppose we'll have to see how it works out.

20:05.160 --> 20:10.680
But as long as you have the option to have a traditional home directory, then I don't

20:10.680 --> 20:12.200
see a problem with it.

20:12.200 --> 20:18.320
The problem I see is if we end up being forced into it, then I'm going to need a bit more

20:18.320 --> 20:19.320
convincing, I think.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.320
Yeah, fair enough.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.920
And it sounds like that's the goal.

20:22.920 --> 20:25.440
And it sounds like they're going to even try to make it portable between a system that

20:25.440 --> 20:27.260
uses the new method and the old method.

20:27.260 --> 20:31.200
But if you're scratching your head, or you think I'm crazy, or this sounds interesting

20:31.200 --> 20:33.480
to you, I definitely recommend you check out the talk.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.800
I'll have it linked in the show notes.

20:35.800 --> 20:41.080
Lenart has slides that go into more detail, as well as he expands upon several points.

20:41.080 --> 20:44.120
And like always, it's a very technically rich conversation.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.960
So it's just fascinating to listen to.

20:45.960 --> 20:48.040
Yeah, it's definitely worth a watch.

20:48.040 --> 20:52.320
And so we've talked about the system D saga as that rolls on and on.

20:52.320 --> 20:55.240
What about the Huawei and Google saga?

20:55.240 --> 20:57.380
We've had a development this week with that.

20:57.380 --> 21:03.720
We've got news that the Mate 30 Pro will ship, but it won't ship with Google's Android apps.

21:03.720 --> 21:08.480
Huawei CEO of the consumer products division revealed on stage at a press event in Germany,

21:08.480 --> 21:12.040
the company was forced to stop shipping the Google mobile services.

21:12.040 --> 21:15.240
But but Joe, don't worry.

21:15.240 --> 21:19.640
They've got the Huawei mobile services, the HMS core, it's ready to go.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.240
It's just not quite the same thing.

21:21.240 --> 21:26.160
Yeah, and there are going to be certain apps available through their app store.

21:26.160 --> 21:29.920
But then some key ones that won't be.

21:29.920 --> 21:34.920
So the expectation among a lot of the tech presses, well, presumably, people will be

21:34.920 --> 21:40.800
able to flash their own Google apps, you know, take a phone, like the OnePlus 3T, unlock

21:40.800 --> 21:45.000
the bootloader, it's trivial to install Google apps on that.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.680
But with Huawei phones, it wasn't that long ago that they stopped letting you unlock your

21:48.680 --> 21:53.280
bootloader, which seems like a decision they may regret now.

21:53.280 --> 21:57.780
You know, the name like Pro 2, you kind of expect a little more and the Mate 30 Pro will

21:57.780 --> 21:59.820
not ship with an unlockable bootloader.

21:59.820 --> 22:04.800
There was some misreporting earlier in the week that suggested that perhaps it would.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.160
However, that does not appear to be the case.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.120
That must have been just a misreading of a statement by the CEO that was a little weird,

22:10.120 --> 22:15.960
like we're going to offer customization, which who knows what that means that could be themes.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.840
Also, Joe, I think what's notable here is they're really kind of locking themselves

22:18.840 --> 22:22.720
in now because you could have sold the hardware and if you made it easy to unlock, then the

22:22.720 --> 22:28.040
users that cared enough could have had an avenue to maybe load Google apps or different

22:28.040 --> 22:29.860
ROM entirely.

22:29.860 --> 22:36.400
And they're also trying to claim that their solution is good enough and just use that.

22:36.400 --> 22:41.920
It's two complete BS answers like the reason they gave for not allowing the unlocking is

22:41.920 --> 22:42.920
for security.

22:42.920 --> 22:46.300
Well, and also for the whole support thing as well.

22:46.300 --> 22:50.760
Once you start flashing custom ROMs, then you can get into a lot of trouble and end

22:50.760 --> 22:55.760
up costing Huawei money to support that, which, you know, I could understand the argument

22:55.760 --> 22:56.760
at the time.

22:56.760 --> 23:01.520
I thought it was a bad move, but, you know, I could definitely understand it.

23:01.520 --> 23:03.920
But the question I have for you is this.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.920
What if they get away with it somehow?

23:05.920 --> 23:10.880
What if there are enough apps and they can convince the big app makers to port their

23:10.880 --> 23:11.880
apps over?

23:11.880 --> 23:13.920
Wouldn't that be something?

23:13.920 --> 23:18.800
If in the West they could ship a phone without the Google services?

23:18.800 --> 23:23.880
Because we saw that happen with Amazon and, okay, they were very cheap devices, the cheap

23:23.880 --> 23:28.000
tablets and a couple of phones, I think, that didn't do very well.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.160
But those tablets seem to be doing all right for them.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.880
But that's, you know, they're very cheap.

23:31.880 --> 23:35.420
This is a high end, really nice phone.

23:35.420 --> 23:42.240
And if they could somehow pull this off, I think it would actually be a very good thing

23:42.240 --> 23:43.240
for the market.

23:43.240 --> 23:45.080
Yeah, I can't disagree with that.

23:45.080 --> 23:52.800
I think the mistaken reasoning here is calling these things apps, the Google apps versus

23:52.800 --> 23:54.200
the Huawei apps.

23:54.200 --> 23:56.000
It's not really the apps.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.840
It's the APIs and the cloud service behind all of that.

23:58.840 --> 24:07.680
Like the Google Play API delivers so much functionality to Android now that it is a

24:07.680 --> 24:11.640
completely different product without it.

24:11.640 --> 24:15.160
Now I know a lot of people in our audience are capable of running an Android phone without

24:15.160 --> 24:16.680
the G apps perfectly fine.

24:16.680 --> 24:21.540
I did it for a few weeks and I was amazed at the better battery life that I got.

24:21.540 --> 24:24.720
But eventually, eventually I caved.

24:24.720 --> 24:27.680
You know, I can't remember at the time if it was Google Maps or what it was.

24:27.680 --> 24:31.480
But I had to, I had to install something that needed the Google Play API.

24:31.480 --> 24:36.600
And once you make that change, it's like your phone becomes a completely different device,

24:36.600 --> 24:41.800
including security updates directly from Google that are even broader now in Android 10.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.520
It's not about the apps.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.160
It's a false comparison.

24:45.160 --> 24:49.320
And a lot of the apps that are good on the Android platform rely on Google's back end

24:49.320 --> 24:54.760
APIs for push notifications or even for running in the background for an extended period of

24:54.760 --> 24:55.760
time.

24:55.760 --> 24:59.280
They're only available via Google's APIs.

24:59.280 --> 25:04.240
And then there's the cloud infrastructure for text to speech and image recognition and

25:04.240 --> 25:08.200
image enhancements when you use the camera and all of the things that Google does in

25:08.200 --> 25:12.160
the cloud to make Android better are also gone.

25:12.160 --> 25:14.280
So it's a much larger conversation than just the apps.

25:14.280 --> 25:19.920
And that's why I think they're screwed because they'll always be on a less than OS if they

25:19.920 --> 25:21.980
just ship Android.

25:21.980 --> 25:25.560
Because the comparisons will be made between Android with Google apps and Android without

25:25.560 --> 25:26.560
Google apps.

25:26.560 --> 25:30.240
And it's just like how Samsung, even with their massive scale, has never been able to

25:30.240 --> 25:31.520
fully compete.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.200
I think Huawei will be in a similar position.

25:33.200 --> 25:36.840
They'll get close, but they'll always have the Bigsby of voice assistance.

25:36.840 --> 25:37.840
Yeah.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.520
So basically, dream on, Joe.

25:39.520 --> 25:40.520
It's not happening.

25:40.520 --> 25:41.520
I don't know.

25:41.520 --> 25:42.520
I don't know.

25:42.520 --> 25:43.520
Maybe I'm crazy.

25:43.520 --> 25:47.840
I think if they have their own, I don't know, maybe Linux based OS that was really great

25:47.840 --> 25:52.320
that they just invested all this time in, then it would be their own unique product.

25:52.320 --> 25:55.600
Maybe you'd have a better shot, especially if they could go after a market that was sick

25:55.600 --> 25:58.640
and tired of all these smartphones and spying on you.

25:58.640 --> 26:02.800
Maybe and they've still got their home market as well of Asia where Google is much less

26:02.800 --> 26:03.800
important.

26:03.800 --> 26:04.800
Yeah, absolutely.

26:04.800 --> 26:05.800
It's a really good point.

26:05.800 --> 26:07.960
They don't even need us, Joe, right?

26:07.960 --> 26:12.960
But we all need Oracle because they've announced Oracle Autonomous Linux, which changes everything.

26:12.960 --> 26:16.280
Wait, wait, oh, I'm sorry.

26:16.280 --> 26:17.280
You got a correction here.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.280
It changes nothing.

26:18.280 --> 26:19.280
What?

26:19.280 --> 26:25.160
You mean a version of Red Hat, essentially, that provisions itself, scales itself, tunes

26:25.160 --> 26:29.000
itself, patches itself, all autonomously?

26:29.000 --> 26:31.640
That's not going to completely change the market?

26:31.640 --> 26:38.440
You mean like a CentOS box with central management or a really nice bash script?

26:38.440 --> 26:46.120
I tease a little bit only because of just like how like full guns Larry was up on stage.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.340
This is a quote from Larry Ellison.

26:48.340 --> 26:52.200
If you're paying for IBM, you can stop.

26:52.200 --> 26:57.380
One simple rule to prevent data theft, put your data in an autonomous system.

26:57.380 --> 27:00.000
No human error, no data loss.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.960
That's the big difference between us and AWS.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.500
That doesn't make any sense.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.080
You want to avoid data loss?

27:06.080 --> 27:07.080
Have a good backup.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.080
Yeah.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.080
Yeah.

27:09.080 --> 27:15.400
I mean, it does sound like a pretty good product that would do well in enterprise.

27:15.400 --> 27:21.520
I could see it doing well, but just the way it's been pitched and it's sort of overblown

27:21.520 --> 27:23.080
seems a bit strange to me.

27:23.080 --> 27:25.760
I suppose you have to do that, don't you, if you're trying to sell stuff?

27:25.760 --> 27:26.760
Yeah.

27:26.760 --> 27:32.040
And I think the reason why it doesn't ring as powerful as a message to us is because

27:32.040 --> 27:33.760
other vendors have gotten there first.

27:33.760 --> 27:36.720
In fact, this was the whole premise of CoreOS.

27:36.720 --> 27:43.400
This is the premise of Ubuntu Core, Fedora Silverblue, what will become of Fedora CoreOS.

27:43.400 --> 27:48.520
Like yeah, yeah, this is something that the vendors have been thinking about for a while.

27:48.520 --> 27:55.000
And what you've done is repackaged a solution that is already mostly theirs.

27:55.000 --> 28:00.760
I don't mean to laugh, but it's just, it's like they really came at this like just trash

28:00.760 --> 28:06.560
and everybody, but what they've brought to the market is really valuable if you're an

28:06.560 --> 28:07.960
Oracle Cloud customer.

28:07.960 --> 28:10.880
It's legitimately going to be nice on their infrastructure.

28:10.880 --> 28:16.240
But for me, this rings as hollow as unbreakable Linux did when they announced that.

28:16.240 --> 28:21.160
It was all the same big talk and it didn't really change much of the market.

28:21.160 --> 28:23.560
It got users, it's still in use today.

28:23.560 --> 28:29.680
Wikipedia says that as of 2016 at least, they had 15,000 customers subscribed to the support

28:29.680 --> 28:30.680
program.

28:30.680 --> 28:33.560
I'm curious to know what that number is in 2019.

28:33.560 --> 28:36.200
So I don't have high expectations for this one, Joe.

28:36.200 --> 28:40.160
But they had a cluster of Raspberry Pis that was basically a supercomputer running this

28:40.160 --> 28:41.160
thing.

28:41.160 --> 28:42.880
You telling me that didn't impress you?

28:42.880 --> 28:44.000
Hmm, maybe.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.720
Almost as much as the unofficial word on the street.

28:46.720 --> 28:50.920
Just a quick follow up to last week, a new version of CentOS is out and I haven't tried

28:50.920 --> 28:56.160
it myself, but word on the street is at the last moment, they got Raspberry Pi basic booting

28:56.160 --> 28:57.160
support in there.

28:57.160 --> 29:01.360
I don't think the video stuff is supported yet, but you can boot CentOS on a Raspberry

29:01.360 --> 29:02.360
Pi.

29:02.360 --> 29:03.360
That, that impresses me.

29:03.360 --> 29:07.780
Yeah, we were talking last week about how we've been waiting for CentOS that's based

29:07.780 --> 29:10.240
on RHEL 7.7.

29:10.240 --> 29:13.080
And that has arrived now.

29:13.080 --> 29:17.600
And also, it looks like CentOS 8 is just around the corner as well.

29:17.600 --> 29:21.440
September 24 is what the wiki saying now for CentOS 8.

29:21.440 --> 29:26.600
I am kind of excited about that version of CentOS because that's based on the version

29:26.600 --> 29:29.280
of RHEL, which is based on Fedora 28.

29:29.280 --> 29:35.100
Fedora 28 is the release where they enabled software modularity, they made it easier to

29:35.100 --> 29:40.960
install third party drivers, they've updated it to a fairly recent version of Gnome, it

29:40.960 --> 29:46.280
has improved virtual box support, it ships with newer versions of GCC, like it's a big

29:46.280 --> 29:51.020
release of Fedora and looking back at it now, you can see that they were clearly trying

29:51.020 --> 29:54.280
to get it pretty solid as a possible RHEL base.

29:54.280 --> 29:58.760
So this next version of CentOS 8 is a pretty major upgrade.

29:58.760 --> 30:03.900
And it's probably the first time ever that I've been excited about a CentOS release,

30:03.900 --> 30:10.120
which is a really weird thing to say because it's like the least like hype distro out there.

30:10.120 --> 30:12.560
But here I am, I can't wait.

30:12.560 --> 30:16.840
Having a long term support version of Fedora 28 is going to be great.

30:16.840 --> 30:21.360
And let's face it, what you're most excited about is finally being able to use DNF on

30:21.360 --> 30:22.360
CentOS.

30:22.360 --> 30:25.520
You absolutely 100% true.

30:25.520 --> 30:28.720
That is the major thing that and I think I'm gonna be able to put on the Raspberry Pi 4,

30:28.720 --> 30:32.760
but it's primarily it's DNF.

30:32.760 --> 30:36.320
Well one last thing while we're talking about things that I'm looking forward to, we have

30:36.320 --> 30:43.240
launched linuxheadlines.show and it is a Linux news podcast in under three minutes every

30:43.240 --> 30:44.240
weekday.

30:44.240 --> 30:47.400
You wouldn't think we could get much in there but you'd be surprised and in fact it gives

30:47.400 --> 30:51.400
us an opportunity to cover stories that don't make it on Linux action news.

30:51.400 --> 30:55.080
This is where we have the long conversations but the things that are happening every single

30:55.080 --> 30:57.320
day linuxheadlines.show.

30:57.320 --> 31:00.400
It really is a great way to stay up to date with what's going on in Linux and open source

31:00.400 --> 31:01.640
every weekday.

31:01.640 --> 31:03.760
So check it out, linuxheadlines.show.

31:03.760 --> 31:05.480
And then be sure to get us every single week.

31:05.480 --> 31:10.640
To do that go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

31:10.640 --> 31:13.820
And linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

31:13.820 --> 31:18.240
Of course we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source

31:18.240 --> 31:19.240
news.

31:19.240 --> 31:20.240
I'm at Chris LAS.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.200
I'm at Joel Ressington.

31:22.200 --> 31:24.800
Thank you for joining us and we will see you next week.

31:24.800 --> 31:43.120
Until then, have a great day and I'll talk to you later.
