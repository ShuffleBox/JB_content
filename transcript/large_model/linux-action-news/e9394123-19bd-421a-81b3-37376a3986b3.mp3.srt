00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 133, recorded on November 24th, 2019.

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,480
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,480
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,480
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,640
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,840
We start this week with great news for security researchers.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,680
Yeah, Mozilla, GitLab, and Google have all increased their bug bounty amounts.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,200
Yeah, I'll get to some of the dollar amounts here in a second, because these are some big

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,200
numbers.

10
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,600
I thought it was noteworthy that Mozilla is expanding their program not only to include

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:37,080
Firefox bugs, but also they're adding their core sites to their program like Firefox Monitor,

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,120
the Firefox Private Network, a lot of their tools that they've been releasing as part

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,400
of the overall Firefox brand are now getting included in part of their bug bounty program.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
And that's pretty neat.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,700
I also like to see what GitLab is doing.

16
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,080
But I think the big story in all of this, like the real numbers, is the Android stuff.

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,320
These are like, change your life kind of numbers.

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,440
Yeah, the top amount if you find a security flaw in the Titanium secure element on the

19
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,040
pixel devices, in a developer preview is $1.5 million.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,320
I mean, that is life changing.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,920
Yeah, it really is incredible.

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,320
And there's other numbers for other bugs, obviously, they're still pretty mind boggling.

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,320
There's a $500,000 reward, depending on the particular exploit category.

24
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,900
There's a range here.

25
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,500
But what I think it really is saying is that Google is getting more and more confident

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:28,960
in the pixel, Titan, Android stack overall.

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,520
Yeah, it is saying that.

28
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,480
But it's also saying that they'd much rather have these vulnerabilities disclosed on their

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
terms.

30
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,640
Yeah, I can understand why it's a, it's a much more manageable situation there.

31
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,840
There's a lot of end users, not to mention the reputation on the line, a couple of highlights

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
from 2019.

33
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:50,500
So far, their total payments Google's in the last 12 months have been $1.5 million.

34
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:57,360
Over 100 participating researchers have received an average reward amount of over $3,800 per

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
finding.

36
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,980
That worth noting is a 46% increase from last year.

37
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,560
And you've got to assume with them up in the dollar amounts, along with Mozilla and GitLab,

38
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,160
that more people are going to go after this stuff.

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,040
And we know there are already a lot of very shady companies finding these exploits and

40
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
selling them.

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,360
But obviously, it's better for everyone apart from those shady companies, if it's done properly

42
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,520
like this.

43
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,320
And it gives these researchers an opportunity to put their name out there in a really legitimate

44
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,720
way that looks good on a resume.

45
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,360
And a little cash infusion never hurt anybody.

46
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,440
But it also is an implicit acknowledgement by Google that they really are trusting the

47
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,340
Titan M platform, because that's where a lot of this focuses on, but also Android itself,

48
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,160
on the pixel devices, at least.

49
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,480
And I think that matters when you're looking at the security optics of both iOS and Android.

50
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,400
I think Google taking this position is a bigger picture issue that matters more than it might

51
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
look on the surface.

52
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,720
Well, Google are keen to show that they care about Android security, but also for Chrome

53
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
OS.

54
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,760
And this week, although not officially announced, we've got a good indication that Chrome OS

55
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,560
devices are going to be required to support FOPD and the LVFS project going forward.

56
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
This is outstanding news.

57
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,040
I think we all know and appreciate that up to date secure firmwares are a critical part

58
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,520
of a nutritious security diet.

59
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,640
And you can't have a secure box if you're not updating your firmwares properly.

60
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,720
Now, how you do that really varies vendor by vendor.

61
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,640
And over the last year and change, we have seen a massive consolidation around LVFS and

62
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
the FOPD service.

63
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,440
I think this is pretty neat.

64
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:46,560
I also now have a tinge of concern because this project needs a little structure, I think,

65
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
at this point.

66
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,800
And I have all due respect for Richard.

67
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
He's done an incredible job.

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,120
And who the hell am I to say?

69
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,160
But we now have a lot of vendors on board with this thing and a lot of end users using

70
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,160
this thing.

71
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,840
And to bring on a whole bunch of Chromebooks, I feel, takes this to a whole new level.

72
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,520
Well, this comes from Richard Hughes' blog, where he says he's been told by several sources,

73
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,960
but not by Google directly, that from Christmas onwards, the Designed for Chromebook sticker

74
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:19,040
requires hardware vendors to use FOPD rather than random non-free binaries.

75
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,700
And then he goes on to detail exactly how these vendors should contact him and should

76
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,960
go about implementing FOPD.

77
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,680
And it's quite complicated, to say the least.

78
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,880
What came out to me is he's a bit frustrated that this hasn't gone super smooth with previous

79
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
OEMs.

80
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,200
He says here, I might sound like a grumpy, upstream maintainer.

81
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,200
I apologize.

82
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,480
I'm currently working with about half a dozen silicon suppliers who have all failed some

83
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,800
or all of the above bullets.

84
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,120
He goes on to say, I'm multiplexing myself with about a dozen companies right now.

85
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,260
And supporting FOPD isn't actually my entire job at Red Hat.

86
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,800
This project has been such a game changer for the Linux landscape.

87
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,980
Not just desktops, not just laptops, not just Chromebooks, servers too.

88
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,520
And this project feels like it's getting pretty dang important.

89
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,000
And I know there's been some coordination with the Linux Foundation.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,160
There's been some changes there.

91
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,660
But it kind of seems like maybe this is starting to become something important enough to dedicate

92
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,660
full time to.

93
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,920
Maybe it needs a project manager to help interface with these OEMs.

94
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
I don't know.

95
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,400
I'm just some podcaster in a studio.

96
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,080
But I get a sense that this project has reached a new level.

97
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,120
And I mean, really, when Lenovo came on board, let's be honest, when you started getting

98
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,800
Dell and Lenovo and Acer and all these firmware updates for server platforms all started coming

99
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,880
through LVFS, I think that's when we crossed a line of criticalness.

100
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,440
But if Google's taking that sticker saying design for Chromebooks and saying compliance

101
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:55,440
with this sticker means using LVFS in Fwepty, we cross into a whole new threshold, Joe.

102
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,400
Well, yeah, hopefully Google are going to pony up the cash to make it happen, because

103
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,760
it's clearly going to be very important to them, especially for their security story.

104
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,160
So maybe this really is great news for the project.

105
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
Oh, I think so.

106
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,240
I mean, these are growing pains that I just brought up.

107
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,560
I'm sure they can be solved.

108
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,700
For all I know, Huesies is already well into a plan to solve this.

109
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,360
It sounds like from this post, things are a little frustrating today.

110
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,880
I hope to see this take off, though.

111
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,720
I mean, there's so clearly a need for this.

112
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,720
And if the more vendors we get into this, just the better the experience is for Linux

113
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
users.

114
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,560
Well, I actually finally cracked on the Chromebook thing, an ordered one over the weekend.

115
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,000
Hopefully it'll be here within a day or two.

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,360
It is an old one.

117
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,360
It's used.

118
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,360
It's an Acer Chromebook R11.

119
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
It's got a touchscreen.

120
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,840
It's one of those convertible things.

121
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,440
It's going to be supported until June of 2022.

122
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,080
So I'll have two and a half years with it, hopefully.

123
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,960
And I'm led to believe it supports Android apps and Linux apps.

124
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,640
So it'll be good fun to play with it.

125
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,520
Have you seen if there's a firmware update available for you?

126
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,420
Well, I haven't got it yet, but I don't suppose it's going to be supported by this.

127
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,400
It looks like it's only going to be new ones, but you never know.

128
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Fingers crossed.

129
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,800
Yeah, I mean, a lot of Acer systems are supported.

130
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,200
So maybe it's not a big deal for them to add support for older Chromebooks, probably not

131
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
likely though.

132
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Yeah.

133
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,680
But I've been very keen to try it for a while, and I just thought, right, I'm going to have

134
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
to do it.

135
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
I got it pretty cheap.

136
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,880
So yeah, I'll be talking about that, hopefully, in the future.

137
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,320
Well, when you do get that, and you get around to putting Debian on there, you may have your

138
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,380
choice of init systems all over again.

139
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,120
It's like it's 2014 again, Joe.

140
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,680
Yeah, I don't understand this.

141
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,720
I've been following it for the last few weeks.

142
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,080
And it's a resurgence of the system D and Debian debate.

143
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,960
I thought that was all settled, but apparently not.

144
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,800
It's a culture war essentially, Joe, inside the project.

145
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,720
So this all really changed back in 2014 when Debian switched to using system D as the default

146
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,180
init system.

147
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,560
The intent was that other init systems would be supported, but system D would be the default

148
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,160
for Debian.

149
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,600
Since then, technically that support has continued, but not very functionally.

150
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:13,440
And during the last release cycle, some tensions exploded, and bugs have been turned into fights

151
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
as a result of this.

152
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,840
The project isn't moving forward.

153
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,020
And so it's time for another general resolution to try to resolve this.

154
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:25,680
But from what I can read, Joe, even how this general resolution has been gone about is

155
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,520
sort of up for debate.

156
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,420
Well, yeah, initially, Sam Hartman, the Debian project lead, made three proposals, which

157
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:39,760
is quite unusual, proposal A, B, and C. But then Ian Jackson came in with a slightly more

158
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,920
nuanced proposal.

159
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,520
But then there was even a fifth proposal by Dmitry Bogatov.

160
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:51,480
And it feels to me that Sam Hartman was trying to push things towards system D has won.

161
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,280
And although it's kind of nice if we can support the other init systems, system D is progressing

162
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,200
at quite a pace, adding features, and the other init systems are just going to be left

163
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,200
behind.

164
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,240
So just kind of deal with it.

165
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Right.

166
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,840
And that's in contrast with another philosophy that, and tell me if you think I'm wrong,

167
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:15,480
that I see as Debian should be a platform for everyone for any contribution, no matter

168
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,120
how small.

169
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,640
And secondly, it's incredibly harder for projects to rip out the init system upstream.

170
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,520
So if Debian goes with system D, it's kind of a foregone conclusion that projects like

171
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,240
Ubuntu get affected by that.

172
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:35,280
Where if they remain a universal platform of sorts, then the distributions build off

173
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,120
of Debian can mix and match how they like.

174
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,120
And it allows for just about anyone to participate.

175
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,240
But there's no structure and process in place to determine what to do when something is

176
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,100
blocking a release or when somebody isn't maintaining something like all of this has

177
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,280
to be politically formalized more than just what the bug trackers process is, but it has

178
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,520
to be something that's politically formalized.

179
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,160
And I don't think there's the will right now.

180
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,000
So I do think I agree with you that there's Sam's approach and then there's a more philosophical

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,440
approach that are essentially at conflict here.

182
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,400
And I honestly thought this was resolved when the Dev1 split happened.

183
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Well, so did I.

184
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:16,120
I thought Debian was going all in on system D and leaving the init diversity and freedom

185
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,120
to Dev1.

186
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,760
But I think the problem here is that Debian has tried to be all things to all people,

187
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,860
the universal operating system.

188
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:32,080
What people were concerned about back in 2014 was that system D was going to take over and

189
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,840
it pretty much has because if you look at the features of system D, there aren't really

190
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,600
parallels with the other init systems.

191
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,520
So you're inevitably going to have incompatibility and you're going to have to make that decision

192
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:51,160
at some point to just cut the others loose and somewhat support them, but just concentrate

193
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
on system D.

194
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,960
I just don't really see the argument against it really because you're going to either have

195
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:04,920
to use system D and not all of its features and fully support the other init systems

196
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,120
or you just have to let them fall by the wayside.

197
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,680
And we have Dev1 for the other init systems, so why not just go all in on system D?

198
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,560
It seemed like that was the case initially with that split.

199
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,820
However, reading into this for this story, I really got down into the weeds.

200
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,400
And this is going to the core of the project.

201
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:32,480
There is at the core of this thing, a health problem with the project and how they discourse

202
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,600
in weaponizing bugs and in their core philosophy, they can't agree.

203
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,540
There are fundamental issues over at Debian and that's what the story is showing us.

204
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,680
And the more I read into it, the more I can kind of see both perspectives.

205
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,480
There is a place for a great universal operating system that has a bunch of great init systems

206
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,840
because if you look at them as all great open source projects that offer something unique

207
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,400
and compelling for different use cases, then it makes a little more sense.

208
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,720
Say a really low powered IoT device, wouldn't it be great if Debian could be a perfect base

209
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,400
of an operating system for IoT devices?

210
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,880
But perhaps default Debian might be getting too heavy.

211
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,760
There's a lot of situations where for containers, it's nice to have a very simple system in

212
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
a container.

213
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,860
Yeah, but isn't that what things like Alpine are for?

214
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,000
Can you really be a universal operating system in 2019, 2020 and beyond?

215
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,200
I think for a certain demo, the people that are really fighting for this thing, they feel

216
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,560
like they've been looked over by the system D has one crowd and that they just get dismissed.

217
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,660
So all that said, I can totally understand your perspective because that was essentially

218
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,960
mine until I really dug into this.

219
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,040
And now I sort of see both sides and I don't know which way they're going to go.

220
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,560
But I think it's going to fundamentally define the future of the project.

221
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,680
I look at this as architectures.

222
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,640
Every really good architecture has a use case for Debian that can be defended and justifies

223
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,340
its development time and resources.

224
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,920
And when an architecture doesn't, after a while, they tend to let it go.

225
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,800
I wonder if that kind of methodology and approach couldn't be applied to init systems.

226
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,120
But perhaps because of the political situation, that is much easier said than done.

227
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,920
Well, there's going to be a lot of discussion in the project and they may come to a conclusion

228
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,520
with this, but I've got a feeling it might rumble on for another five years.

229
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,520
Well, here's something we'd only see in 2019.

230
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:27,280
IBM and Microsoft are working together via the Linux Foundation to fight patent trolls.

231
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
How about that?

232
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:32,640
Yeah, I didn't see this one coming, but it kind of makes sense in retrospect.

233
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,040
You've got a coming together here of a lot of powerful entities within the Linux and

234
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,120
open source world, including Microsoft, which we just have to accept these days that they're

235
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,640
one of them.

236
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,020
And hopefully this means we're going to see an end to these patent trolls attacking open

237
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,380
source software.

238
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,380
I see it that way.

239
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:55,440
These names with this annual subscription and the overall open innovation networks,

240
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,680
huge patent portfolio to begin with, essentially are sending the message that for a large portion

241
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,200
of IP that cover Linux, we're closed for business now.

242
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,840
The patent troll stuff isn't going to work.

243
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,640
It doesn't mean everybody's safe, like Shotwell, for example, but it does mean a lot of the

244
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,780
infrastructure that businesses built on is safe.

245
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,400
And that matters because people that are building products on free software and open source

246
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,720
technology, they want to know that they're safe, they can operate, they can sell, and

247
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,280
they're not going to get sued once their product hits the market.

248
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,120
Well, yeah, and that probably explains why Microsoft and IBM are working together on

249
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
this.

250
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,120
They have a common goal here.

251
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,120
Yeah, it does make sense.

252
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,480
It's just so weird for me.

253
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,520
I live in Microsoft's backyard and the early days of Microsoft were defined by betrayal

254
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
from IBM.

255
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:48,400
And so friends and family members that worked for Microsoft had a real hatred for IBM.

256
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,140
So it's just weird.

257
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,320
It's really weird, but that's been the sub headline to all these Microsoft and IBM stories

258
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,840
for the last two to five years now.

259
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:02,020
And so that weird is just going to become the new normal.

260
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,760
It really has started to become the new normal.

261
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,240
Well, supply chain attacks seem to have become the new normal.

262
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,600
And I always like to end on a cryptocurrency story, so I couldn't resist this one.

263
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,480
The official Monero website was hacked this week, and some of the binaries were replaced

264
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,640
with currency stealing malware.

265
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,360
Why bother trying to mine it when you can just steal it?

266
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,880
It's the worst when it's a wallet that's stealing your money.

267
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,880
That's really something.

268
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
Oh, man.

269
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,580
And it's so embarrassing when it's the binaries.

270
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:35,720
If not just like some text on the website, but the actual binaries for Windows and Linux

271
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
were replaced.

272
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,160
So if you downloaded any Monero wallet software on Monday the 18th of November 2019, between

273
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:52,160
2.30 a.m. UTC and 4.30 p.m. UTC, you definitely need to check the hashes of your binaries.

274
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,720
I'm sorry to report.

275
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,160
This is a really bad look for the project.

276
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,680
If you're serving up downloads of binaries of wallet software, you need to make sure

277
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:06,040
that it's secure and that people are not having their currency stolen.

278
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,600
No kidding.

279
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:17,560
As we record, just a note, the current price for Monero is $48.91 in U.S. greenbacks.

280
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,640
So they did it all for 50 bucks.

281
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,960
I wonder how many coins they got.

282
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,440
I guess maybe somebody could actually check because it'd have to be a blockchain event,

283
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
right?

284
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Yeah.

285
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,560
Well, they've got to be worth more than the Dogecoin that I've still got.

286
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,200
It's definitely profitable if you don't mind it.

287
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,400
If you just steal it, I hear that cryptocurrency is much more profitable.

288
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Oh, dear.

289
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,920
You know, we're getting dangerously close to the end of the year when we'll have to

290
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,760
talk about the Bitcoin price again.

291
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,760
I know.

292
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,720
And for a short period of time, it looked like it was going to possibly pop 10,000.

293
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,160
But again, as we record today, it's also not doing so well.

294
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
It's down to $7,000.

295
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
Not that I'm watching.

296
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
I'm not watching, though.

297
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Of course not.

298
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,400
I kind of wanted to see Monero be successful and now that it hasn't failed, I shouldn't

299
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
say it like that.

300
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,400
But the thing I liked about Monero is that it was a privacy-focused currency that I don't

301
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,200
know, I see a need for that, especially for political dissidents and journalists and countries.

302
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,080
Like, imagine trying to be a journalist exposing government deeds in China right now.

303
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:28,800
Like, what are you using to buy your goods and pay people that are helping you?

304
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,680
You know, there's a need for these kinds of things.

305
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,000
Maybe in the West, people might have cushy lives and, you know, a nice stable government

306
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,800
currency and they don't need to worry about this.

307
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,060
But there are absolutely individuals in the world that need something like this.

308
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,680
And then I just totally geek out on the idea of an open source currency that's backed by

309
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,680
math.

310
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:50,200
That's so much cooler than paper money that we just assign value to, just from like a

311
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
geeky perspective.

312
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,200
So Monero was one of the ones I was kind of secretly saying, come on, come on, go for

313
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,440
it.

314
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,320
But not a lot of trading volume compared to where I thought it would be by now.

315
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,600
And just sort of one bad story after another, Joe.

316
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,240
Well, bad news in the cryptocurrency world is always good news for me because it gets

317
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,120
me closer to that $2,000 Bitcoin value on December 1st that I predicted.

318
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,520
Damn it, Joe.

319
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,320
It's not worth taking down the whole currency, Joe, not for a damn prediction.

320
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,560
You stupid predictions.
