Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.320 --> 00:20.200
This is episode 11, recorded on July 23rd, 2017.

00:20.200 --> 00:21.200
And I'm Chris.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.200
And I'm Charlie.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.160
Hey, Joe, it's good to be back with you.

00:24.160 --> 00:29.120
And I should say right off the top here, thank you to Mr. Ryan Sipes for filling in last

00:29.120 --> 00:30.120
week.

00:30.120 --> 00:33.120
Joe, we have so many things to get into.

00:33.120 --> 00:40.200
Why don't we start with the death of what was surely the next big desktop OS.

00:40.200 --> 00:44.240
Remix OS, a desktop version of Android.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.240
Is it the death of it?

00:45.240 --> 00:46.240
That's the question.

00:46.240 --> 00:49.460
It's the death of it as we know it.

00:49.460 --> 00:55.360
So it was made by a company called Jide, who had a couple of Kickstarters for a tablet

00:55.360 --> 00:58.360
and then a mini desktop PC.

00:58.360 --> 01:02.000
I've actually got that, the Remix Mini, the desktop PC.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Really?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
What do you think of it?

01:04.000 --> 01:10.760
I think that it was OK, but then they abandoned it like all Android OEMs do.

01:10.760 --> 01:15.200
Which is often not their fault because it's down to the components inside it get abandoned

01:15.200 --> 01:18.440
by the upstream hardware manufacturers.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.120
So there's not a lot they can do really.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.720
But it's an interesting concept.

01:23.720 --> 01:27.040
But I just feel that it never really took off, did it?

01:27.040 --> 01:30.600
This idea of Android with a panel and floating windows that you can resize.

01:30.600 --> 01:35.840
Yeah, so their whole approach here was you could take Android x86, toss it on a laptop

01:35.840 --> 01:40.200
or something like that of your choice, and run Android applications in windowed mode

01:40.200 --> 01:42.440
with a menued launcher.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.160
And they did several Kickstarters.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.920
In fact, some backers are still waiting for their product, but we'll talk about that more

01:47.920 --> 01:50.200
in just a moment.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.600
But here's what they discovered.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.760
They built some of these consumer products, they got them in the hands of some consumers,

01:55.760 --> 01:57.840
and an interesting customer came knocking.

01:57.840 --> 01:58.840
The enterprise.

01:58.840 --> 02:02.800
And they say that over the past year, they've received an increasing number of inquiries

02:02.800 --> 02:07.760
from enterprises in various industries and began helping them build great tools for their

02:07.760 --> 02:11.360
organizations by leveraging giant software and hardware.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.360
What does that mean?

02:12.360 --> 02:13.360
What do you think?

02:13.360 --> 02:15.060
Read between the lines on that.

02:15.060 --> 02:22.120
Can you seriously expect enterprise to move away from Windows to an Android based OS?

02:22.120 --> 02:23.480
I didn't take it as that.

02:23.480 --> 02:28.020
So I've had an interesting realization while traveling recently to Montana and having a

02:28.020 --> 02:33.360
few conversations with people at the campsites, and also with my trip to Dell.

02:33.360 --> 02:39.560
There is really cool future tech in these enterprises in really weird ways, like often

02:39.560 --> 02:44.480
like in the common areas in the cafeteria, for example, at Dell, they have a Linux powered

02:44.480 --> 02:50.400
automated barista robot thing that you go up there, you order from your smartphone,

02:50.400 --> 02:54.380
and then it just delivers you a robot makes you a perfect cup of coffee, and delivers

02:54.380 --> 02:56.000
it to you.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.480
At Pixar, everything you buy everything with your badge, and it's been that way for a decade.

03:01.480 --> 03:07.520
Payment, wireless tap payment has been available in cafeterias in enterprises for a decade.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.480
And we're just now getting it here in the States as consumers.

03:10.480 --> 03:15.120
And all of these different devices are powered by different types of operating systems.

03:15.120 --> 03:20.240
And I could see different enterprises that would need particular types of handheld devices,

03:20.240 --> 03:26.040
or dedicated machines that are very purpose built, that they would contract to Jyde, Jyde

03:26.040 --> 03:30.840
would do that work for them and deliver a product and then maintain it for a for a maintenance

03:30.840 --> 03:31.840
fee.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.720
And it's gonna be way more profitable than the consumer space.

03:34.720 --> 03:39.240
If I was like, if Jyde hired Chris, the consultant, and I came in there to advise them, I would

03:39.240 --> 03:42.880
tell them, focus on businesses, this is where you're going to make your money.

03:42.880 --> 03:47.060
So what you're saying to me is that they've proven that they can take Android and make

03:47.060 --> 03:52.280
it into a desktop OS, and in that same way, they can take it and turn it into whatever

03:52.280 --> 03:56.840
you want, not necessarily a desktop OS, and probably almost definitely not.

03:56.840 --> 04:01.880
It would be having some sort of custom interface to do a certain job.

04:01.880 --> 04:06.740
Yeah, and it could even be things that are, you know, just purpose built for a large conference

04:06.740 --> 04:12.860
setup or a hotel that wants to have a smart controller in the room and, or, or, you know,

04:12.860 --> 04:16.920
they want to revamp all their business centers with a branded desktop experience.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.520
They could see all kinds of uses for something like this.

04:19.520 --> 04:22.980
And they say, as a result, they're going to restructure their business and transition

04:22.980 --> 04:25.040
away from the consumer space.

04:25.040 --> 04:30.280
As a result, all development on existing products, such as remix OS for PCs, as well as products

04:30.280 --> 04:36.040
in the pipeline, such as remix IO, and the IO plus will be discontinued, which were successfully

04:36.040 --> 04:37.600
funded, I think.

04:37.600 --> 04:38.600
Yeah.

04:38.600 --> 04:43.320
And if you did fund it, then you're going to get a refund, they promise.

04:43.320 --> 04:47.360
Which I think now we've had this discussion, I feel more confident that people will get

04:47.360 --> 04:52.000
their refunds because now it's kind of all fallen into place for me.

04:52.000 --> 04:57.060
Maybe they did this remix OS thing to prove that they had the software engineering chops

04:57.060 --> 05:00.600
to do something decent.

05:00.600 --> 05:06.040
And maybe their long-term goal wasn't necessarily to do desktop only with Android.

05:06.040 --> 05:10.120
It was basically to prove that they can compete with, because there are a ton of other companies

05:10.120 --> 05:15.520
out there who can take Android and customize it, and maybe even make just a completely

05:15.520 --> 05:21.680
bespoke OS for what is essentially, well, it's not really Internet of Things, but it's

05:21.680 --> 05:24.360
certainly embedded devices.

05:24.360 --> 05:28.000
And maybe that's what this whole thing's been about for them, just making a big name for

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
themselves.

05:29.000 --> 05:32.700
It's either that, Joe, or they realized which way the wind was blowing pretty quick and

05:32.700 --> 05:37.600
somebody savvy said, we got to pivot, quote unquote, and make this move to survive.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.360
And they're just, they're executing.

05:39.360 --> 05:40.360
Yeah, maybe.

05:40.360 --> 05:41.360
Yeah.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.360
Maybe that's what it's about.

05:42.360 --> 05:46.880
However, despite all of this, from the ashes rises Phoenix OS.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.720
I actually don't think this is too new.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.360
This has been sort of a competitor that's been brewing for a little while.

05:51.360 --> 05:52.600
It's kind of a boost for them.

05:52.600 --> 05:58.800
Yeah, well, this is a Chinese distro, which is very Chinese when you look at it.

05:58.800 --> 06:04.400
The thing about remix OS was that it, although Jai do a Chinese company, I think, it was

06:04.400 --> 06:11.400
a very generic, almost stock Android feeling OS that had the Play Store for a while.

06:11.400 --> 06:15.160
And then they kind of had to rip that out, but you could put it back in.

06:15.160 --> 06:19.400
Whereas Phoenix OS is very much for the Chinese market.

06:19.400 --> 06:26.800
I think you can boot it up into an English mode, but it's a lot of the applications are

06:26.800 --> 06:32.360
their names for them are Chinese characters and it doesn't have the Play Store.

06:32.360 --> 06:38.480
And it's ostensibly similar to remix OS, but it just feels very much not for the Western

06:38.480 --> 06:40.440
market to me.

06:40.440 --> 06:44.720
They've just recently released Phoenix OS 2.1, which includes not only a bunch of bug

06:44.720 --> 06:50.100
fixes and hardware compatibility, but they've also now included an updated keyboard mapping

06:50.100 --> 06:56.000
feature which will help you position these windowed touchscreen applications around your

06:56.000 --> 06:59.800
screen without actually having to raise your hand from the keyboard up to the screen.

06:59.800 --> 07:00.960
That's a solid feature.

07:00.960 --> 07:05.880
You look at it just from a screenshot perspective, Joe, and I swear, at really first glance,

07:05.880 --> 07:10.240
it almost looks like Windows 10 with a classic Windows theme.

07:10.240 --> 07:15.240
Yeah, that's reasonably fair, kind of Windows 10 meets Chrome OS, I suppose.

07:15.240 --> 07:16.240
Yeah.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.160
And so I tried to give this a pretty solid go.

07:19.160 --> 07:23.200
I wanted to just sort of kick the tires and get an idea of what it was like because it

07:23.200 --> 07:27.280
crossed my mind, if I could put this on a machine where I could get hardware acceleration,

07:27.280 --> 07:30.140
maybe I could install a couple of Android games on my laptop.

07:30.140 --> 07:31.960
So I have the Dell XPS 13.

07:31.960 --> 07:38.880
I tried to load it on the Dell XPS 13 with both UEFI turned on, secure boot was off,

07:38.880 --> 07:41.440
and in legacy boot mode, couldn't get it to load.

07:41.440 --> 07:47.800
I tried to load it in VMware and in VirtualBox, couldn't get it to load the graphical environment.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.120
I got it to boot, couldn't get it to load the graphical environment.

07:51.120 --> 07:56.840
Tried it on a Dell Precision laptop, same story.

07:56.840 --> 08:02.360
Legacy mode, UEFI, didn't matter, wouldn't even boot on the system.

08:02.360 --> 08:07.840
So I tried it across several pieces of hardware, and I was just sort of left underwhelmed.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.080
Were you able to get it going?

08:09.080 --> 08:11.800
Yeah, so I tried downloading the ISO first.

08:11.800 --> 08:12.800
That's what I did, yeah.

08:12.800 --> 08:18.460
Yeah, I DDed it to a stick, and it just didn't work, basically, so I thought, okay, so the

08:18.460 --> 08:24.440
other alternative is they've got a large EXE, which is essentially the ISO with a bit of

08:24.440 --> 08:28.680
Windows software that will install it.

08:28.680 --> 08:29.680
It's weird.

08:29.680 --> 08:34.960
So I've got a few Windows partitions lying around on various machines, and so I chucked

08:34.960 --> 08:40.880
it on Windows 7, and what it does is it basically adds it to the Windows boot list.

08:40.880 --> 08:45.200
I don't know enough about Windows to know exactly how it works, but it's the equivalent

08:45.200 --> 08:46.200
of grub within Windows.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.680
Yeah, like your boot.ini file is how it used to be in Windows, at least.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.660
Yeah, I think, yeah, that's kind of it.

08:51.660 --> 08:58.000
And so you have to boot from grub into Windows, and then you've got the choice of either Windows

08:58.000 --> 09:05.160
or Phoenix OS, and that worked, well, it kind of worked, but it wouldn't get the video

09:05.160 --> 09:09.680
mode right because the box I was doing it on was my projector, which is, I've ever told

09:09.680 --> 09:10.680
you about that.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.760
It's pretty sweet, my Gigabyte bricks projector.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.600
You have a machine hooked up to a projector?

09:14.600 --> 09:19.400
No, no, the machine is a projector, so it's a Gigabyte bricks, right, which is basically

09:19.400 --> 09:21.680
an Intel NUC rip-off, right?

09:21.680 --> 09:26.720
So it's an i3, it came as an i3 bare-bones, I just put four gigs of RAM in it and a small

09:26.720 --> 09:34.720
SSD, and so you can plug it in with HDMI, and it's just a regular desktop PC, but it's

09:34.720 --> 09:40.880
got a built-in projector, and so it's pretty low-res is the only thing, it's a Pico projector,

09:40.880 --> 09:46.880
and so you can run that totally independently, so you can project the operating system that

09:46.880 --> 09:51.800
you're running on there, but that, because it's quite low-res and the screen that I plugged

09:51.800 --> 09:58.600
into was 1080p, it kind of confused it a little bit, so that didn't work out, but you can

09:58.600 --> 10:04.960
make a USB stick out of the EXE as well, which I did, and then I booted that on my main test

10:04.960 --> 10:07.040
laptop and that worked absolutely fine.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.040
How does it look?

10:08.040 --> 10:09.400
Does it perform okay?

10:09.400 --> 10:10.400
What was your takeaway?

10:10.400 --> 10:15.120
Well, I only had a little bit of time to look at it, but yeah, it's pretty solid, it works

10:15.120 --> 10:20.080
pretty well as you'd expect, I mean I've got a fair amount of experience with Android X86,

10:20.080 --> 10:27.400
which of course is similar to it, but is just a standard touch interface, which is not well

10:27.400 --> 10:30.400
suited to keyboard and mouse at all.

10:30.400 --> 10:35.840
So this just feels similar performance-wise, but it didn't have the Play Store, so I couldn't

10:35.840 --> 10:39.720
really check out many of the apps that I'm used to, it just kind of has their built-in

10:39.720 --> 10:40.720
ones.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.200
Well, you could always enjoy F-Droid, I suppose.

10:42.200 --> 10:45.840
Yeah, I should do that really.

10:45.840 --> 10:52.200
As I said on Late Night Linux recently, I'm a bit over it really, the whole Android as

10:52.200 --> 10:58.040
a desktop, I just think that it had its chance and the applications that you can run on it

10:58.040 --> 11:01.120
just haven't really delivered.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.280
This is how I feel as well.

11:03.280 --> 11:04.880
That's why you need to strap it to your face.

11:04.880 --> 11:09.160
If you're a Google Enterprise partner, they have a second iteration that they're beginning

11:09.160 --> 11:10.440
to sell right now.

11:10.440 --> 11:14.600
They say they have tested and deployed across many factories in the United States by companies

11:14.600 --> 11:20.600
such as Boeing, GE, DHL, and while I was in Montana, sitting right next to me, at the

11:20.600 --> 11:25.920
very moment, Mr. Noah Chalaya got an invitation to join the Google Glass Enterprise program

11:25.920 --> 11:28.360
and he signed up immediately.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.640
So there you go, Joe, maybe you just need to strap it to your face.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.880
Yeah, good thinking.

11:32.880 --> 11:37.980
This is a real interesting one, man, because Google Glass, I went to an event in London,

11:37.980 --> 11:44.520
it must have been four years ago, maybe five years ago, where they were displaying it and

11:44.520 --> 11:48.000
you could try it out and stuff and I thought, yeah, this is really cool.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.480
And then you go to buy it and it was a thousand pounds, I was like, whoa, if this was like

11:52.480 --> 11:58.160
a hundred and fifty pounds, maybe I'd be thinking about it because it felt very beta.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.700
And then it just didn't do very well and it seemingly died.

12:01.700 --> 12:09.480
And then do you recall, it must be a month or two months ago, there was a story that

12:09.480 --> 12:14.960
these Google Glass sets, I don't know, devices, I suppose you'd say, had received an update.

12:14.960 --> 12:19.840
Yeah, yeah, I think it was back in March, there was an NPR report and then Wired recently

12:19.840 --> 12:20.840
just wrote about it.

12:20.840 --> 12:27.040
So there's been some rumors about it, but it has shifted because that was testing and

12:27.040 --> 12:31.920
now they're actually emailing former Google Glass customers and saying, come one, come

12:31.920 --> 12:35.160
all, come buy the new Google Glass, but first talk to us for the price.

12:35.160 --> 12:39.120
So when I was sitting next to Noah, he's sitting there signing up, becoming a Google Enterprise

12:39.120 --> 12:44.400
partner, and through all of this process, he still was not told what the price of Google

12:44.400 --> 12:45.400
Glass was.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.000
They're going to contact him.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.560
But they say they've made major upgrades from the original one.

12:50.560 --> 12:54.840
The Enterprise has a much better camera, it's an eight megapixel from five now, they've

12:54.840 --> 13:00.640
improved the battery life, they put faster Wi-Fi chips in there, a better processor,

13:00.640 --> 13:04.120
and they've added a recording video light that all of you guys are going to have to

13:04.120 --> 13:07.680
figure out how to hack off that turns on when you're recording video.

13:07.680 --> 13:12.360
Google also says that they have made the electronics modular and they've created a so-called glass

13:12.360 --> 13:18.280
pod, which can be detached and then reattached to glass compatible frames, so maybe more

13:18.280 --> 13:23.160
stylish frames or maybe protective lenses depending on the application.

13:23.160 --> 13:28.160
And they say that it'll be easier to work with prescription lenses as well, which makes

13:28.160 --> 13:29.160
a ton of sense.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.760
And they're all in, they went out of their way.

13:31.760 --> 13:36.160
The project lead said this is not an experiment, it was an experiment three years ago, this

13:36.160 --> 13:42.200
is now full-on production with our customers and our partners, hoorah, I have that part.

13:42.200 --> 13:45.160
Yeah, this is a real surprise to me.

13:45.160 --> 13:48.580
It turns out they've been working on this for at least a couple of years and testing

13:48.580 --> 13:52.400
it in various factories and enterprises.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.480
And that suddenly makes sense, doesn't it?

13:54.480 --> 13:59.240
Because the idea of it as a consumer product, it was never going to take off, but you suddenly

13:59.240 --> 14:04.400
put it in this industrial application where people are making things in factories.

14:04.400 --> 14:11.440
The example in this wide article was an airplane parts factory and usually, or before they

14:11.440 --> 14:16.960
got this, they had to reference laptops or paper or whatever and it was really slowing

14:16.960 --> 14:17.960
them down.

14:17.960 --> 14:21.080
Whereas this has just made them so much more efficient to be able to pull up either through

14:21.080 --> 14:26.780
touch or voice the various instructions for the next bit that they need to do.

14:26.780 --> 14:29.880
And it just suddenly makes so much more sense, doesn't it?

14:29.880 --> 14:34.340
And for consumers, there is still some practicality to it, but I bet Google's going to let other

14:34.340 --> 14:35.400
people dabble in that.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.600
There's some implications here about hardware partners.

14:37.600 --> 14:43.360
So we may see other manifestations of Google Glass, but right now what they're targeting

14:43.360 --> 14:47.720
as a direct sale, I agree, Joe, it makes a ton of sense, especially if you can build

14:47.720 --> 14:52.360
apps for this thing that are purpose-built for your business, it could kind of be obvious

14:52.360 --> 14:53.460
at that point.

14:53.460 --> 14:57.040
Can you believe that we're sitting here talking about Google Glass in 2017?

14:57.040 --> 14:58.040
I didn't expect it.

14:58.040 --> 15:01.400
Yeah, although in some ways it seems like they were a little bit ahead of the game because

15:01.400 --> 15:03.480
now AR is all the rage.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.040
Yeah, that's true.

15:05.040 --> 15:07.360
And this is a very lightweight version of that.

15:07.360 --> 15:10.760
Instead of having a huge headset over you, it's just in the corner of your eye.

15:10.760 --> 15:13.160
I mean, I presume you've checked out Noah's one.

15:13.160 --> 15:14.160
Yeah.

15:14.160 --> 15:18.120
And he'd tell you that the most useful feature is actually the ability to take a quick picture

15:18.120 --> 15:19.120
of stuff.

15:19.120 --> 15:22.720
He uses it as his digital memory because he has the memory of a goldfish.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.040
He'd be the first person to tell you that.

15:24.040 --> 15:28.320
So he can take pictures of stuff and then combines it with Google Photos, has it upload

15:28.320 --> 15:29.560
to Google Photos.

15:29.560 --> 15:34.840
And then two days later when he needs to remember, he's just, oh, I think it was a red box.

15:34.840 --> 15:36.960
And so he says, this is a conversation we had.

15:36.960 --> 15:41.200
He'll just go type in red box in the Google Photos and all of the red boxes show up.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.080
And oh yeah, that's the thing I was trying to remember.

15:43.080 --> 15:44.240
There it is.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.900
And for him, that was, he described it as this.

15:47.900 --> 15:51.400
That made it so that he genuinely, because he hasn't used Google Glass now for months,

15:51.400 --> 15:57.000
he genuinely feels that there was a time in his life before Google Glass and after Google

15:57.000 --> 16:01.040
Glass because it made such an improvement in his productivity.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.920
I don't know if that's true or not.

16:02.920 --> 16:06.920
I have not experienced that level of improvement with Google Glass when I tried it, but I tried

16:06.920 --> 16:09.760
it for a very limited amount of time.

16:09.760 --> 16:13.240
He was so on board that he immediately signed up to get the new version.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.240
Yeah.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.040
Well, this is not the last we're going to be hearing of this, I don't think.

16:16.040 --> 16:19.720
I think we're going to be talking about it over the months and years ahead.

16:19.720 --> 16:20.720
I agree.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.240
Something we might be talking about a lot less very soon.

16:23.240 --> 16:28.280
In fact, sooner than I think either you or I thought even, is Firefox.

16:28.280 --> 16:32.600
This is a devastating piece that was posted by the former CTO of Mozilla, sort of a follow-up

16:32.600 --> 16:34.840
piece to something we've covered before.

16:34.840 --> 16:37.520
And when I read through this, my heart sank a little bit.

16:37.520 --> 16:38.520
Yeah.

16:38.520 --> 16:43.720
The previous piece was called Chrome 1, I think, or Chrome was 1, and basically analyzed

16:43.720 --> 16:52.280
some data by stat counter that was very damning of Firefox in terms of user numbers.

16:52.280 --> 16:57.640
And this is a follow-up piece where he's actually looked at some of the data from Mozilla, their

16:57.640 --> 17:02.320
public data, and it really does not look good.

17:02.320 --> 17:07.840
If you look at the chart of it, it's kind of just very much a downward spiral.

17:07.840 --> 17:12.040
And I think what's most interesting about this is not, I mean, we all knew that Firefox

17:12.040 --> 17:16.840
was tanking in terms of user numbers, but it's why.

17:16.840 --> 17:22.920
And it's when he goes into the why of it and he posts some screenshots here of people using

17:22.920 --> 17:30.960
Google products like Gmail, YouTube, even Google search and Google calendar and just

17:30.960 --> 17:33.760
constant nags to install Chrome.

17:33.760 --> 17:34.760
Yeah.

17:34.760 --> 17:35.760
I've seen it.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.760
You've seen it probably.

17:36.760 --> 17:37.760
Yeah.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.120
It's like, stop telling me about this.

17:40.120 --> 17:44.820
And that's what I always say, but it's free advertising.

17:44.820 --> 17:50.160
It's probably hundreds of millions of dollars worth of free advertising for their browser.

17:50.160 --> 17:53.340
It's really invaluable because they don't offer that advertising space to anyone else

17:53.340 --> 17:58.240
because it's the very top of their most premium products like Gmail and YouTube and Google

17:58.240 --> 18:00.220
Docs and Google Calendar.

18:00.220 --> 18:02.540
They don't sell ads in that space.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.480
It's literally invaluable space.

18:04.480 --> 18:05.480
Yeah.

18:05.480 --> 18:11.760
And, well, the guy who I set up a laptop for, he's quite old.

18:11.760 --> 18:17.520
And then I go back there, you know, I set him up an XP machine basically, and he's been

18:17.520 --> 18:19.600
used to using Internet Explorer.

18:19.600 --> 18:23.240
So I just thought, well, let's not rock the boat, set him up with that.

18:23.240 --> 18:26.240
I go back a few months later and he's using Chrome.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.880
I said, how come you're using Chrome?

18:27.880 --> 18:30.160
He said, I just thought it was an update.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.160
Interesting.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.280
Obviously this had happened to him.

18:32.280 --> 18:34.720
It had popped up, hey, upgrade.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.840
They use words like that.

18:36.840 --> 18:37.840
Upgrade to Chrome.

18:37.840 --> 18:38.880
Improve your experience.

18:38.880 --> 18:39.880
Watch YouTube.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.320
Get special offline Google Calendar access.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.320
Yeah.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.680
To get Calendar offline, upgrade to Chrome.

18:45.680 --> 18:50.880
And so that kind of language to an inexperienced user, if they've had it drummed into them

18:50.880 --> 18:56.640
by someone technical like me, always do your updates, always do upgrades, then they're

18:56.640 --> 18:58.400
just going to instinctively do it.

18:58.400 --> 19:02.480
And that's why they've driven this massive adoption to Chrome.

19:02.480 --> 19:03.480
Yeah.

19:03.480 --> 19:04.480
Yep.

19:04.480 --> 19:10.120
And really to drive this point home, just look at the data from the last year.

19:10.120 --> 19:14.760
Firefox has lost 16 million installs in the last year.

19:14.760 --> 19:20.600
22% fewer Firefox desktop installs are active today than a year ago.

19:20.600 --> 19:26.520
And what's kind of ironic about that, and this post also makes this point, is that the

19:26.520 --> 19:33.680
last year has seen some of the most innovative, interesting development technically in Firefox's

19:33.680 --> 19:35.120
history for years.

19:35.120 --> 19:39.840
So while Firefox is making changes that are, from an engineering standpoint, some of their

19:39.840 --> 19:45.680
best work in years, their usage is continuing to decline.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.600
Well, they just can't compete, can they?

19:48.600 --> 19:51.200
It's not an even playing field is the bottom line.

19:51.200 --> 19:56.440
And that's when you get things like EU competition laws coming into place.

19:56.440 --> 19:57.960
And I don't know how to feel about that.

19:57.960 --> 20:04.200
I mean, I'm reasonably libertarian in as far as you don't have to use Google services,

20:04.200 --> 20:08.840
and therefore you don't have to be advertised to for the other Google products.

20:08.840 --> 20:14.320
And getting them, I probably shouldn't get too political like this, but this idea of

20:14.320 --> 20:18.880
them being penalized for promoting their own shopping services on their own search engine.

20:18.880 --> 20:24.200
Well, use Yahoo or use Bing if that's a problem to you.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.800
Yeah, I kind of agree with you on that.

20:26.800 --> 20:30.040
But you also have to look at this position that Firefox is in.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.000
It's not an engineering problem.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.840
This is clearly not because in some ways they're really cleaning up their past engineering

20:36.840 --> 20:37.840
issues.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.440
It is truly a market disruption problem.

20:40.440 --> 20:45.480
It's a desktop to mobile shift, and it's a Google monopoly problem with their monopoly

20:45.480 --> 20:46.480
on search.

20:46.480 --> 20:50.960
There's literally no engineering solution that Firefox can come up with to fix this

20:50.960 --> 20:51.960
issue.

20:51.960 --> 20:57.120
It is a huge problem because Google needs to grow as a publicly traded company.

20:57.120 --> 21:01.480
They're going to continue to have to grow, and the web is becoming more and more stagnant,

21:01.480 --> 21:06.880
and they have to leverage their unique platforms to sell their own products.

21:06.880 --> 21:11.120
It's their only option for growth at this point, and it's too tempting for them to refuse.

21:11.120 --> 21:14.000
So there's really nothing that can be done because they're always going to find a way

21:14.000 --> 21:18.180
to do this regardless of what the EU does or anybody else.

21:18.180 --> 21:21.840
And the thing is, this isn't like the days of IE.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.320
Google's still hungry.

21:23.320 --> 21:28.680
Google still wants to push the web forward, so they continue to advance Chrome at a breakneck

21:28.680 --> 21:30.440
pace.

21:30.440 --> 21:35.160
And that's not like when Firefox first came around and IE was dominant.

21:35.160 --> 21:38.320
It was stagnant, and Microsoft wasn't being competitive.

21:38.320 --> 21:44.080
But Chrome is not standing still, and Google is active in the web standards bodies, and

21:44.080 --> 21:47.800
they're actively integrating technologies that they believe in into Chrome and pushing

21:47.800 --> 21:51.000
that across their widely used platforms.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.860
It's not the same landscape that Firefox came into.

21:53.860 --> 21:58.400
It's a totally different competitor now, and it's one that has literally the home field

21:58.400 --> 22:02.640
advantage.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.600
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

22:04.600 --> 22:10.640
Go there to sign up for a free seven-day trial and support Linux Action News and learn more

22:10.640 --> 22:11.640
about Linux.

22:11.640 --> 22:16.040
It's a super great platform built by Linux enthusiasts with all kinds of features built

22:16.040 --> 22:21.700
in that Linux users would expect, hands-on labs with scenario-based training, servers

22:21.700 --> 22:24.020
that spin up on demand when you need them.

22:24.020 --> 22:27.540
You preselect the distribution you want for the courseware, and the server that spins

22:27.540 --> 22:31.640
up will match that selection, and then you just SSH in and work on the command line in

22:31.640 --> 22:33.760
a scenario-based lab.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.840
That's great when you're learning AWS, too.

22:35.840 --> 22:39.820
If you're busy, they have a course scheduler that lets you stick to a time frame and works

22:39.820 --> 22:41.940
with you to find content.

22:41.940 --> 22:45.240
And they have learning paths if you want to go deep into something specifically.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.560
And my favorite feature, instructor mentoring.

22:47.560 --> 22:50.120
Real human beings whenever you need it.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.120
There's so much more.

22:51.120 --> 22:55.200
Just go to Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to sign up for a free seven-day trial and

22:55.200 --> 23:02.520
support this show, Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

23:02.520 --> 23:06.960
Now someone who seems to come up almost every week on this show is Alan Pope, or Popey as

23:06.960 --> 23:09.040
he's better known, friend of the show.

23:09.040 --> 23:14.560
And this week he's posted on his blog the Ubuntu Artful Desktop July Shakedown.

23:14.560 --> 23:21.160
And so this is encouraging people to download the daily images of 17.10 and test them and

23:21.160 --> 23:24.760
report bugs because it's halfway through the cycle now.

23:24.760 --> 23:29.040
I can't believe that we're halfway to the 17.10 release.

23:29.040 --> 23:35.080
And obviously this is a major release in terms of it's got a whole new desktop that Ubuntu

23:35.080 --> 23:38.860
is moving over to GNOME now instead of Unity.

23:38.860 --> 23:41.000
And so there's a lot to test.

23:41.000 --> 23:45.280
And interestingly, he's not saying you should do what they call the full ISO testing, which

23:45.280 --> 23:46.640
is really, really involved.

23:46.640 --> 23:49.120
This is more user-friendly, I suppose.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.120
This is more-

23:50.120 --> 23:51.120
Day-to-day.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.120
Yeah.

23:52.120 --> 23:55.000
He's looking for people to say log in and try using Ubuntu on Wayland sessions for normal

23:55.000 --> 23:56.800
day-to-day activities and file bugs.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.080
Check out suspend and resume.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.100
Make sure everything still works as you expect it.

24:01.100 --> 24:06.360
Try out external network cards and dongles and maybe external displays.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.360
Connect Bluetooth devices.

24:07.360 --> 24:12.600
They've done a lot of work on Bluetooth and try out some of that stuff and see that everything

24:12.600 --> 24:13.920
works as expected.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.560
Just really kind of the stuff that impacts your day-to-day use of the desktop.

24:16.560 --> 24:17.560
Yeah.

24:17.560 --> 24:21.840
I really want to test that Bluetooth stuff because I can't be alone here.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.560
Bluetooth in Linux is just a disaster.

24:24.560 --> 24:29.320
I use Bluetooth every day with my phone because I have a little receiver, I suppose you'd

24:29.320 --> 24:30.320
call it.

24:30.320 --> 24:31.320
It's got a mic on it as well.

24:31.320 --> 24:35.200
It's not Bluetooth headphones that you plug your headphones into this little square Sony

24:35.200 --> 24:36.200
thing.

24:36.200 --> 24:40.880
I use it every day for listening to podcasts and music and when I'm driving to make phone

24:40.880 --> 24:45.880
calls and stuff like that, but on a Linux desktop, forget about it.

24:45.880 --> 24:49.640
It just seems to never work or if it does work, it'll work for a bit and then just drop

24:49.640 --> 24:50.640
out.

24:50.640 --> 24:54.840
I have a Bluetooth speaker that I can only get to work the first time I've paired it

24:54.840 --> 24:58.800
and every time I want it to work after that, I have to delete the pairing and then repair

24:58.800 --> 25:03.480
the device as if it were new and then it will work during that session only.

25:03.480 --> 25:04.480
Yeah.

25:04.480 --> 25:07.800
As we know, wired audio is dead.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.840
We live in a, what was it?

25:09.840 --> 25:11.380
Not brave.

25:11.380 --> 25:15.960
What was the word that Apple used for their decision to drop the headphone jack?

25:15.960 --> 25:16.960
Courageous.

25:16.960 --> 25:17.960
Yeah.

25:17.960 --> 25:18.960
Courage.

25:18.960 --> 25:19.960
We are moving to that world, aren't we?

25:19.960 --> 25:22.200
Bluetooth is just so much more convenient.

25:22.200 --> 25:27.400
If Ubuntu can blaze the trail on that, then I really, really hope they can and make it

25:27.400 --> 25:28.400
work really well.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.080
I'm keen to get testing on this.

25:30.080 --> 25:35.760
I've been really busy with work and podcasting, so I haven't done any tests on these latest

25:35.760 --> 25:39.720
images yet, but I'll do that this week when I've got some time and hopefully report any

25:39.720 --> 25:46.360
bugs that I find and try and make this Bluetooth thing better because I'd like to see other

25:46.360 --> 25:50.400
distros and other desktops take advantage of the work that they're doing here.

25:50.400 --> 25:51.400
It's long overdue.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.400
Yeah.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.520
Boy, do I agree with that.

25:54.520 --> 25:58.380
This is looking like a massive release.

25:58.380 --> 26:04.400
The biggest we've seen in years, years, maybe since 1204, maybe.

26:04.400 --> 26:07.400
I would really encourage people to take a look at this.

26:07.400 --> 26:12.240
Also, I'm just going to give a quick plug to friend of the show, Martin Wimpress, the

26:12.240 --> 26:17.720
Ubuntu Mate Spin of 1710 also looking amazing.

26:17.720 --> 26:23.920
We could be looking at a series of massively significant releases on the Ubuntu side of

26:23.920 --> 26:26.880
things in October.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.760
Getting to get a little bit excited about this.

26:28.760 --> 26:33.560
That's kind of unusual because normally you'd only really get excited about the LTS releases

26:33.560 --> 26:37.360
because that's something you're actually going to use long term, whereas you're only going

26:37.360 --> 26:42.680
to use the 1710 release for a few months, but it's going to be so different, isn't it,

26:42.680 --> 26:45.200
from the previous one?

26:45.200 --> 26:51.040
Let's face it, since what, 1404, basically nothing's changed in mainline Ubuntu.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.880
I'm really glad they're doing this work now.

26:52.880 --> 26:58.720
They're taking big changes in risks right now so that way when 1804 lands, they've got

26:58.720 --> 27:04.520
a lot of this stuff ironed out and along those lines, Dustin Kirkland of Canonical recently

27:04.520 --> 27:11.840
posted an Ubuntu 1804 LTS desktop default application survey and it's been posted in

27:11.840 --> 27:16.960
several places around the web trying to get a feel for what people want to see in future

27:16.960 --> 27:17.960
releases.

27:17.960 --> 27:21.400
They say we already have beta code for 17 available for testing, but let's look forward

27:21.400 --> 27:22.440
a little bit.

27:22.440 --> 27:26.120
What do you want to see as the default applications in the future?

27:26.120 --> 27:30.920
Yes, I filled this in on Reddit and I think my answers speak volumes about what I want.

27:30.920 --> 27:37.400
I said terminal, XFCE4 terminal, file manager, Thunar.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.400
No.

27:38.400 --> 27:41.400
Yeah, of course.

27:41.400 --> 27:44.340
The question is what are you using and that's what I'm using.

27:44.340 --> 27:45.760
What did you say for web browser?

27:45.760 --> 27:46.760
Firefox.

27:46.760 --> 27:47.760
Yeah.

27:47.760 --> 27:48.760
There's no point saying Chrome.

27:48.760 --> 27:49.760
They can't ship it.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.040
Maybe that's why I saw so many Firefox answers.

27:52.040 --> 27:56.800
I saw, I would say, the majority of people saying Firefox and then maybe Chromium.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.000
Yeah, Chromium, but again, that's not as free as people think.

28:00.000 --> 28:08.120
The downloads stuff in the background, I think really your only option is to ship Firefox

28:08.120 --> 28:12.400
and enable people to then install Chrome easily, facilitate it.

28:12.400 --> 28:13.480
Yeah, that makes sense.

28:13.480 --> 28:18.240
To me, this does though feel like old school Ubuntu.

28:18.240 --> 28:22.920
Really kind of just getting in with the community and saying, well, what does it take to make

28:22.920 --> 28:24.720
the best Debian desktop?

28:24.720 --> 28:27.160
Only now it's what does it take to make the best Ubuntu desktop?

28:27.160 --> 28:31.480
They're asking questions that I feel like they were asking a long time ago.

28:31.480 --> 28:36.480
They're asking those same questions again and it's going to be interesting to see what

28:36.480 --> 28:41.200
the results are because sometimes you get results you didn't expect.

28:41.200 --> 28:45.020
I honestly expected Chrome or Chromium and we're seeing a lot of Firefox stuff, but tons

28:45.020 --> 28:48.160
of people are saying file manager, just use Nautilus.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.720
They're just saying go with the defaults on a lot of this stuff.

28:50.720 --> 28:54.760
It's been posted on Hacker News, Reddit, and Slashdot, and we'll also have the official

28:54.760 --> 28:59.320
Ubuntu Insights blog post linked in the show notes if you want to give them your answers

28:59.320 --> 29:03.160
on the things you'd like to see shipped as default in Ubuntu 18.04.

29:03.160 --> 29:06.920
Yeah, and if you don't use Ubuntu, you can always just troll them.

29:06.920 --> 29:09.840
Yeah, yeah, there you go.

29:09.840 --> 29:10.840
That's a great idea.

29:10.840 --> 29:14.360
