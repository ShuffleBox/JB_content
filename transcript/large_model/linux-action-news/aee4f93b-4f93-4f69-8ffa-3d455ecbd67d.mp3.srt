00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,240
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,280
This is episode 53, recorded on May 13, 2018.

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,280
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,280
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,460
It's good to be connected with you.

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,220
Happy Yankee Mother's Day to you, all the moms out there and all the dude moms.

8
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,000
And let's kick off a big show with Linux apps officially being announced for Chrome OS by

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,200
Google this week.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,580
Yeah, this is something that we've been reporting on for what feels like weeks or months at

11
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,760
this point.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,880
But now with Google IO comes the official announcement, although there's not much information

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880
about it.

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,620
But at least we know it's definitely happening, that you can actually try it now.

15
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,880
With some dev builds of Chrome OS, you can run proper Linux applications.

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,800
Yeah, it appears that Google has created a virtual machine that was designed from scratch

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
for Chromebooks.

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,400
At least this is their claim.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,180
And they say it'll start in seconds and integrate completely with typical Chromebook features.

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,920
You'll be able to launch Linux apps with a click of an icon.

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,960
The windows can be moved around, files can be opened directly from apps, and there's

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,180
a preview that's coming to Pixelbooks soon.

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,880
But maybe don't get your hopes up too much.

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,280
Yeah, it's going to be the end of the year at least by the time this is actually stable

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,960
and completely working.

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,840
And even then, it's only going to be on a few high-end Chromebooks that are very expensive.

27
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,280
And at that point, if you're going to spend $1,000 on a machine, aren't you better off

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,680
buying a proper Linux machine?

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,680
I don't know.

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,260
I'm not really too surprised that it's only going to work on the nicer Chromebooks.

31
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:44,060
What's really happening here is they've created a VM called CROSVM, C-R-O-S-V-M.

32
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,540
And it's using Linux's KVM hypervisor.

33
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,460
So that tells you you're going to have to have some resources, some power to actually

34
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,100
make this thing work.

35
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,560
And you're going to see it trickle out for a bit, and I wouldn't be surprised if the

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,960
enterprising community members out there don't get this working in other Chromebooks.

37
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,800
But around July 31, Chrome OS 68 is due.

38
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,740
That's when the beta stuff, like the quote-unquote stable but still kind of beta, you know how

39
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,960
Google does things, that's when that lands, is on version 68, which will be around July

40
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,600
31.

41
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,560
They say, they being folks from Google that spoke with the register, that they're still

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,760
having issues getting graphics and sound drivers to play ball.

43
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,680
And on some models, it's trickier than on other models.

44
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,720
And there could be some tweaking required before you'll be able to just fire up Linux

45
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,640
if you get started early.

46
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,560
But like Joe was saying, the quote-unquote fairly stable version isn't expected until

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,520
Chrome 71, which is the end of the year.

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,800
Maybe by then, you'll see more powerful Chromebook shipping, another iteration, another generation

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
of Chromebooks.

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,120
We may bring that bar up just with the next batch of hardware.

51
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,640
But wasn't the whole point of Chromebooks that they were inexpensive, didn't need much

52
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,960
RAM, didn't need much storage.

53
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,720
And now if you're going to need to have at least four or eight or 16 gigs of RAM and

54
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,440
loads of storage to store all these applications, they're just going to get so expensive that

55
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,960
I return to my original point.

56
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,920
Don't you want a proper laptop at that point?

57
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,480
It does put the Pixelbook into more perspective.

58
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,880
Why has Google been shipping $1,000 Chromebook?

59
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,320
You can start to see some of the reasons.

60
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
I don't know, Joe.

61
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,520
I think we're seeing a gold rush here in a way.

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,920
You have Microsoft shipping the Windows subsystem for Linux.

63
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,400
You've got Dell shipping the Sputnik laptops.

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,200
And now you've got Google working hard to make Linux apps possible on Chromebooks.

65
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,320
They're all trying to get to that dev sweet spot where they can sell a machine to a software

66
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
developer.

67
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,700
And they all think they have a different crack on it.

68
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,760
Google's crack is simplicity, replaceability, cloud storage.

69
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,840
But I tend to agree with you.

70
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,320
If they go down this route, they're going to have to redefine what makes a Chromebook

71
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,920
a Chromebook because you're going to need more storage and you're likely going to need

72
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,420
more RAM.

73
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,380
Chrome itself takes quite a bit of system resources.

74
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,240
So to run complicated applications on top of that, I think you will have to redefine

75
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,780
what a Chromebook means.

76
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:10,200
To me, a Chromebook is something that someone who's never really had a laptop before would

77
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
use.

78
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,320
It's a browser and that's pretty much all it was historically.

79
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,040
My mother-in-law has got one and happily uses it and talks to my wife and all the rest of

80
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,840
it on Hangouts and has a great time and it's secure and simple and easy to use.

81
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,320
To target it at a developer, I just don't really see why a developer would want a Chrome

82
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,680
OS device because you could just install Chrome on an XPS 13 or whatever and you're going

83
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,840
to have a broadly similar experience plus way more.

84
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,120
I can see why they want to go after the developers because it is a lucrative market but it just

85
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,400
seems misguided to me.

86
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
See, I disagree.

87
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,440
I think this is the brilliance of Google's strategy.

88
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,440
You start out small and simple and you build up from there and with Linux as the base,

89
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,200
they have a lot of potential.

90
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,760
They can get brand trust and recognition for creating laptops that are reliable and easy

91
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:07,520
to reload and are fairly safe for average users and have maybe the term simplicity implied

92
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,560
to them.

93
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,200
Those are fundamentals that appeal to people that just want to get their job done, that

94
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,120
just want to get work done and there's a lot of developers out there that fit in that category.

95
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,880
If the device is sophisticated enough to do their job but simple enough to stay out of

96
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,640
their way, it's going to be appealing.

97
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,080
But then the other aspect of Chromebooks that is I think pretty important to remember is

98
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:35,320
the centralized management of them which is extremely appealing to schools, universities

99
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,840
and enterprises.

100
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,920
So you start looking at fleet machines that are cheap to buy in bulk so you can buy standard

101
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,840
universal chargers, standard universal VGA or whatever kind of projector adapter you

102
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,480
might need and you have an orchestration management suite that sits on top of all of them that

103
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,600
lets your enterprise, school, university, whatever manage them from one central point.

104
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,440
It becomes very appealing to these groups to start issuing them as standard machines

105
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,480
and as they become more capable, why not?

106
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,680
Like there becomes less and less reason to do so.

107
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,320
And at the same time, they're converging on that mindset of I just need a machine that

108
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,680
can get my work done and if now I can run Sublime Text or Atom Editor or Visual Studio

109
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,840
Code and I can have Chrome, I'm pretty much good to go.

110
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,440
Yeah, I suppose I was thinking about this from the wrong angle then because I'm thinking

111
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,680
about freelance developers who wouldn't be interested in this but as you say, yes, when

112
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,960
you take into consideration that orchestration and deploying this on a large scale to a lot

113
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,080
of developers or students, then yeah, that suddenly makes more sense.

114
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,880
Maybe I'm not smarter than Google after all then.

115
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,600
Well, it looks like they're finally outsmarting OEMs or at least putting their feet to the

116
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,280
fire with some changes that were sort of under the wire from Google IO this week.

117
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,200
Yeah, this came out of the What's New in Android Security talk from Google IO.

118
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,760
And what Google are doing here is mandating that if you're going to be part of the Android

119
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,840
Partner Program, you're going to have to commit to regular security patches.

120
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,880
We don't know whether that means monthly but you would have thought so, wouldn't you?

121
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
I hope so.

122
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
I am very elated by this news.

123
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,640
This is something that I have really given Google a hard time about for a long time.

124
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,640
In my personal opinion, this should have been the way these agreements worked from day one.

125
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,360
And I think Google felt differently.

126
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,320
They thought for market adoption reasons that they could backfill this problem.

127
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,480
And so maybe they're right, maybe I was right, but these are changes that will be landing

128
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
as of Android P.

129
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,840
So if you're on a release before Android P, I'm sorry to say this will not apply to you,

130
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,340
but there is a silver lining.

131
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,760
When you finally get a P or newer Android device, you're going to take advantage of

132
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,180
a bunch of things that Google's been working on for years.

133
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,520
You've heard us talk about Project Treble before.

134
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,280
That's the modular piece that allows the drivers for the system on a chip and those components

135
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,360
to be developed separately from the Android layer.

136
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,680
And in this talk, they tried to couch this whole thing.

137
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,320
They tried to ease the blow by going through the history of we've been working on Treble,

138
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,440
making this possible.

139
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,440
We're trying to get this easier and easier for OEMs, but if you want to continue to be

140
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,840
our partner, you will begin to patch your devices.

141
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,520
Now we don't know how Google's going to vet this to know if they actually fix the issue

142
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,180
because that's also something we've talked about in the past is sometimes these patches

143
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,680
quote unquote don't fix all of the problems.

144
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:25,000
And we also don't know if Google has any provisions in place to reprimand partners or set a very

145
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,480
specific timeline.

146
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,120
But early days are looking good and you'll likely be able to find the talk online within

147
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,560
the next couple of days to get the details yourself.

148
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,720
But in the talk, they say, we've been working with our OEMs to build this patching into

149
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,080
our agreements.

150
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,120
Now this is a reality.

151
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,240
It'll lead to a massive increase in the number of devices and users receiving regular security

152
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
patches.

153
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,480
And that was Google's head of Android Platform Security.

154
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,240
I am very, very excited to hear that news.

155
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,280
I have been waiting for many Google IOs for them to address this specific problem.

156
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,120
I suspected it was coming when they announced Treble and now this is the other shoe dropping.

157
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,320
But isn't this going to create a two tier system where you've got the more expensive

158
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:11,160
phones which are part of the partner program and then all of the other cheap ones that

159
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,680
aren't and they won't commit to this.

160
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,320
And so if you can't afford to buy an expensive phone, you're just not going to get any security

161
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
updates.

162
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
I don't know.

163
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,980
I think we already have that today.

164
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:27,680
You generally have your premier Android devices from Samsung and other manufacturers that

165
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,320
do get updates, your sort of category leading devices that stay patched because that's what

166
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,980
that customer base wants.

167
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,640
And then you have the lower tier devices which just get neglected.

168
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,400
That's reality today.

169
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,100
With this new security system, they have to comply as part of the partner agreement.

170
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,840
So from here on forward, if they want to ship any new versions of Android with the Google

171
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:53,920
apps and all of the Play API stuff that is blessed by Google, they have to play ball.

172
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,960
But there's nothing stopping them shipping an old version which we've seen many, many

173
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
times before.

174
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,000
You can go and buy a phone now that's got security holes in it that's never going to

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
get patched.

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,440
You do also have to wonder if this is going to lead to some new agreements with some alternative

177
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,680
ROMs that people might just start shipping on their devices instead.

178
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
Possibly.

179
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,860
We saw that with CyanogenMod and that didn't end well.

180
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,880
Maybe second time around it might go better.

181
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,960
I don't know if Lineage are particularly interested in doing that, but maybe one ROM maker might

182
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,960
be.

183
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
It wouldn't really appeal to me.

184
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,000
This appeals to me.

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,520
Having security patches, having the Linux device in my pocket that is connected to the

186
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,840
internet 24-7, it really strongly appeals to me to have it updated and secure.

187
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,680
So now this is something I'll be looking for when I'm shopping for Android devices in the

188
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,680
future.

189
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,400
But you may be shopping for an Android device that you didn't even know was running Android.

190
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,660
At least if Google has their way, Android Things 1.0 is now available for developers

191
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,680
to build commercial IoT products.

192
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,000
How long before Stallman starts calling this Android Stings?

193
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Probably already has.

194
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,440
Yeah, so this is for their IoT devices.

195
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:04,160
It's a paired down version of Android that will run with very low resources, as little

196
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,920
as 32 megabytes of RAM, which is significantly less than standard Android.

197
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,680
And it is designed for, well, Internet of Things devices, trying to push it to the billions

198
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,240
of devices trying to connect absolutely everything.

199
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,720
There's a gold rush in that area, and Google wants a part of it.

200
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,060
Yeah, we've seen Ubuntu Core, which addresses this.

201
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,560
We've seen Azure Sphere OS, which is addressing this.

202
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:35,200
And now we're seeing 1.0 of Android Things, which doesn't have a large hardware partnership

203
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,360
to promote.

204
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,700
Doesn't have a huge deep bench of devices.

205
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,700
You can just go load it on.

206
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:46,040
But it does have one card up its sleeve, and that's support for the Raspberry Pi 3 Model

207
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,040
B.

208
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,240
Now, I saw a screenshot of this on Twitter today.

209
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,960
You've been trying it out on your Raspberry Pi.

210
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,360
Yeah, this is where it's so perfectly Google.

211
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,760
It's great, because you log in to the Android Things dashboard, and you just start creating

212
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,640
a custom image for a device.

213
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,880
And then you can download a little utility that works on Linux, also available for the

214
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,220
Mac and Windows.

215
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,000
And it flashes an SD card with everything you need for Android IoT.

216
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,420
And then you boot the Raspberry Pi.

217
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:18,680
It connects back up to your account and starts downloading test images or apps that you've

218
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,480
built for it.

219
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,540
It's pretty slick.

220
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,800
And within five minutes, I had a Raspberry Pi that was connecting back to Google's developer

221
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,280
dashboard that was ready for me to turn it into whatever I wanted.

222
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:34,840
Big question everyone in the audience will be asking is, is Google's dashboard a dashboard

223
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,840
for days?

224
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,000
It's not quite a dashboard for days, but it does have a cool feature that's a lot like

225
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,840
Google Docs, where I could share a creation.

226
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,840
So just to play around, I shared it with you.

227
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,520
So now, like in Google Docs, you add a collaborator.

228
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,760
I added you.

229
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,360
And you can go in there and start mucking around with my Raspberry Pi image, and you

230
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,560
could actually deploy a new image to my Raspberry Pi.

231
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,720
Yeah, this does seem very developer friendly, but there was a big red flag as far as I could

232
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
see.

233
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,920
And that was that they were talking about long-term support, and then they said three

234
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
years.

235
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,920
Yeah.

236
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:11,240
Yeah, where Azure Sphere OS is 10 years, I think Ubuntu Core is five years.

237
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,620
That's a little short for a device that you buy and then put in your home, integrate into

238
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,880
your home.

239
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Three years is a little short.

240
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,060
But I suppose it's early days, maybe, and people are replacing these at a higher frequency.

241
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,400
That's the best I can come up with.

242
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,760
Yeah, contributing yet more to the e-waste problem.

243
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,220
It just seems three years is, for a phone, OK, the kind of old hat.

244
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:38,680
But for something like a thermostat is the go-to, isn't it, for IoT?

245
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,120
A thermostat you have for 20 or 30 years, not three.

246
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,800
Yeah, or light switches, things like that that get built into your wall.

247
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,220
And I think that's my major problem with the Android Things platform, is if I was going

248
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,480
to put on my business consultancy hat and somebody was asking me about building a product

249
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,440
around an IoT platform, my main issue with Android would be it's too nascent still.

250
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,340
They're making a ton of changes to Android right now.

251
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:08,760
And Android IoT is an offshoot of something that's undergoing massive change, especially

252
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,440
with Fuchsia in the background.

253
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,680
We don't really know where that's going, where that's going to lead Android.

254
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,760
I wouldn't bet the farm on this.

255
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,760
I might bet the farm on Azure Sphere OS or Ubuntu Core.

256
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,520
But Android, Internet of Things, the only thing I like about it is it gives me a lot

257
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
of shortcuts.

258
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,600
I can get up and running fast.

259
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,560
There's a lot of system on a chip and system on a module makers who are building for Android

260
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
already.

261
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,600
And Google has a massive infrastructure for me to take advantage of.

262
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,280
But three years and Android's nascent nature in this area really turned me off.

263
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,840
Yeah, Fuchsia was the first thing I thought about here.

264
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:48,040
I thought that was going to be the new platform that they do stuff like this with.

265
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,080
It just seems to be the elephant in the room here.

266
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,320
blast.ting.com.

267
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,600
It's smarter than unlimited.

268
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,240
If you use less, you pay less.

269
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,760
But more than that, I can personally say I am very glad that I'm taking Ting with me

270
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,360
on the road trip down to Texas in a couple of weeks.

271
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,880
They have a CDMA and a GSM network.

272
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,480
That means when I'm on the road, my business is going to be connected.

273
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,240
I have to have internet connectivity to do what I do.

274
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,380
You guys obviously know that, and that's why I choose Ting.

275
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,720
And here's the other part that I am very appreciative.

276
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,780
I've only had to use it once while I was on the road, but they stuck with me.

277
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,040
Their customer support is top notch.

278
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,800
I figured after 45 minutes, they'd bail on me.

279
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
Sorry, sir.

280
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
It's a device.

281
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
We'll get you out a new one.

282
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,200
They hung on the line the entire time while we tried different stuff.

283
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,200
And what I really came to appreciate is these are geeks at Ting.

284
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,720
They're geeks, and they really like this stuff.

285
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,880
And if you're willing to work, they're willing to work with you.

286
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,380
They have a great control panel.

287
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,600
They have fantastic customer support.

288
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,920
So I feel like I have a support net underneath me when I go out on the road.

289
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,300
But here's something that's kind of cool that's coming down from Ting right now.

290
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,760
You can buy a device directly from Ting, and it comes clean.

291
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,760
It's the base OS.

292
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,120
You just do whatever you want with it, or you can bring your own.

293
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,080
And because they have CDMA and GSM, I'd check their BYOD page.

294
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,680
There's probably a good chance your device is going to be compatible.

295
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,120
But if you're looking for a new one, they just launched the Moto Z2.

296
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,960
Now what's familiar about that Moto Z2?

297
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,920
It's the one that supports Moto Mods, where you can hook up different cameras or speakers

298
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,420
or all the different things, like the JBL Sound Boost 2.

299
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,680
All can be snapped in.

300
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,480
Ting is now offering that device.

301
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,880
And if you go to lass.ting.com, you'll get $25 off.

302
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,400
But for a limited time, you can save up to $150 on the Z2.

303
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,020
More details on Ting's blog.

304
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,640
Start by going to lass.ting.com, and then jump around from there.

305
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,640
That's lass.ting.com.

306
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:47,560
It wasn't just Google I.O. that happened this past week, also the Red Hat Summit happened.

307
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,120
And coming out of that, we finally had some clarification on what's happening with Core

308
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,800
OS since Red Hat bought it.

309
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Yeah.

310
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,280
So Core OS is going to continue, but not as we know it.

311
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:03,040
Red Hat will be integrating Core OS Tectonics, which is its Kubernetes distribution, into

312
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,480
Red Hat Enterprise.

313
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,600
Also key, its Enterprise Container Registry System, and of course, its big dog, Container

314
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,640
Linux, which is the lightweight cluster Linux distribution, all of which will be rolled

315
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,920
into Red Hat's primary container and Kubernetes-based software portfolio.

316
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,440
There is one popular omission from Core OS not making it into mainline Red Hat Enterprise,

317
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,640
and that's Rocket, the container standard that is an alternative to Docker.

318
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,240
Instead, that will become a community-supported container technology.

319
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,800
Now the big question that I always had when Red Hat acquired Core OS is what happens to

320
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,920
Project Atomic, which tries to accomplish some of the same goals?

321
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,060
Well, Container Linux and Project Atomic, which is built around the lightweight containerized

322
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:52,600
operating system Atomic Host, will be united into Red Hat's Core OS, all folded into one.

323
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,160
This is from a Red Hat employee, quote, Red Hat Core OS will preserve the best from both

324
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,160
offerings.

325
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:03,360
Ultimately, though, what's really happening here is Red Hat Core OS will supersede Atomic

326
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,720
Host and Container Linux.

327
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,800
Now I don't know if that's true across the board or just in enterprise implementations.

328
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,840
I think those projects will continue as community efforts, and that's something I'm going to

329
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,080
reach out to those different projects and try to get clarification on over the next

330
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,280
couple of weeks.

331
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,320
They're all just getting back from Red Hat Summit right now, otherwise I would have tried

332
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,960
to pin them down for this episode, but I will try to follow up on that when they have time.

333
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,760
But here's what we do know, there will be an upstream community version of Core OS,

334
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,520
as Fedora is sort of like to Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and it's all kind of still a work in

335
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
progress.

336
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,920
I think those details are still forming.

337
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,200
And Project Atomic will eventually just be phased away, it sounds like.

338
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,080
But the code itself will live on as other parts of Red Hat Enterprise Linux because

339
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
it's still great code.

340
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,600
It's not like the code's been wasted.

341
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,640
I'm going to have to steal Michael's joke here.

342
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,320
I really hope they call the upstream version Fedora Core OS.

343
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,920
I know.

344
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,920
It would be really kind of the perfect opportunity to bring it back because it always was a little

345
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,840
punchier with that core in there.

346
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,920
Red Hat Core OS will provide the new foundation though for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

347
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:13,200
RHOCP, and I mention that because you're going to hear a lot more about that and Red Hat

348
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,880
OpenShift Online and the Red Hat OpenShift dedicated.

349
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,520
Stay tuned for more information on those in the future.

350
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,600
But this is really for customers who want what's called an immutable infrastructure

351
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,040
where you can destroy a system and spin up a system, the data stays intact, the individual

352
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:33,280
servers are more like cattle than they are pets, and Red Hat's pushing hard into this

353
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
area.

354
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,600
And one of the things that they talked about at Red Hat Enterprise Summit is they're hearing

355
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,440
from customers they want automatic updates, which surprised me.

356
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,680
But in a world of containerization and virtual machines and separate data stores, I could

357
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
see it.

358
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:54,000
And that's really where Red Hat's trying to get to is deliver reliable, solid, enterprise-grade

359
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,340
automatic updates.

360
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,240
And that's what all of this is playing into, that and immutable infrastructure, deploying

361
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,200
systems across open and public clouds and closed clouds and on-premises, it's all one

362
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,320
big effort that they're trying to get to to make infrastructure just a detail, an implementation

363
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
detail.

364
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,640
Instead of thinking about racking a massive server in a rack, you just think about clicking

365
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,000
a button and all of the software behind the scenes deploys everything.

366
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,480
Well, as usual, this is just Red Hat staying on top of market trends.

367
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,600
They didn't get to be the biggest open source company by just resting on their laurels and

368
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,000
never changing.

369
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,360
And they're kind of just at that right size, aren't they, where they can afford to make

370
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,880
these purchases and integrate these other technologies into what they're already doing.

371
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,800
But also, they're small enough to be agile with it.

372
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,960
Yeah, Canonical and others may have gotten there first.

373
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,840
I mean, look at CoreOS as an example.

374
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,880
They were there quite a while ago.

375
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,120
But you have to give credit to Red Hat for not letting this pass by them.

376
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,440
And then when they do act, they're acting very quickly.

377
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,800
I think the whole story around Project Atomic and what happens with Container Linux as a

378
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,800
community project and all of that is still a little fuzzy.

379
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,480
And if I could have only one criticism in all of this is it really feels like Red Hat

380
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,520
is trying to please everyone in a way that Microsoft used to, which I think cost them

381
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
greatly.

382
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,480
And there's one key phrase that Red Hat is promising.

383
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,720
They say, no users or communities will be left behind, which, man, that's a solid statement.

384
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,040
And that's something that you could take to the bank and as an enterprise makes you feel

385
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,040
good.

386
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,380
But as a customer watching from the outside, I look at that and go, well, at some point,

387
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,880
at some point, you have to cut off dead weight and you have to focus.

388
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,860
And so what I do see here is a very convoluted message.

389
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:48,120
And when you add in things like Fedora and CentOS, it gets even more convoluted.

390
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,320
And if I could have any one critique, it would be it feels like they're trying to please

391
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,420
too many people at once.

392
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:59,480
But when you're making $3 billion a year, you can afford to try to please a lot of people.

393
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:03,680
And like you said, Joe, this is Red Hat being savvy and responding to the demands of the

394
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
market.

395
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,740
And I think the components of CoreOS they're integrating are going to be real sellers.

396
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,280
And I think it's going to do well for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

397
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,440
And if I was a Red Hat Enterprise Linux administrator, I'd be very happy to see that Red Hat is staying

398
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,500
on top of this.

399
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,640
They're keeping RHEL and all of the things I love about Red Hat.

400
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,280
But they're expanding into this area, in fact, in some big ways, like with Microsoft.

401
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,560
Yeah, they've been working with Microsoft to bring OpenShift to Azure.

402
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Right.

403
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,160
Red Hat OpenShift, which is Red Hat's Kubernetes platform on Microsoft Azure, which is Microsoft's

404
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,440
public cloud.

405
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,880
And that initially is like, oh, interesting, OK, that sounds kind of logical.

406
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,040
But it's deeper than that.

407
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:45,860
They are offering fully managed services on Azure for people running Red Hat.

408
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,000
Think about that for a moment.

409
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,200
Microsoft is going to be managing Red Hat Enterprise servers running on Azure.

410
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,440
And they're creating a system where you can move infrastructure between on-premises up

411
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:04,400
into Azure, over onto DigitalOcean, back down to your own system, and at Red Hat Summit.

412
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,080
Red Hat's director of developer experience showed off a hybrid cloud using an on-site

413
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:15,240
rack, and then an Azure rack in Texas, and Amazon Web Services in Ohio.

414
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,640
And then using Kubernetes, Red Hat demonstrated that you can load balance across all three

415
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,560
clouds automatically and in real time.

416
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:29,120
Pretty big for people that have a large on-premises deployment but need a little extra infrastructure

417
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,280
from time to time, which is a lot of companies.

418
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,400
And now you can build for Red Hat on-premises and deploy up to Azure.

419
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,160
And sitting on top of all of this is the fact that Azure was just recently certified by

420
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:47,280
the Australian government for use with Australian government private information.

421
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:51,260
They have the certification that they give out to only a few cloud hosting providers,

422
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,920
and now Azure is one of them, which I think is one of the reasons Red Hat wanted to get

423
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
this in the bag.

424
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,840
Now, I'm sure there's plenty of people out there thinking, Red Hat causing up to Microsoft,

425
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,840
I don't like that.

426
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:08,640
But this is the reality of enterprise computing now, that Microsoft are a huge part of it,

427
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,920
and companies like Red Hat have no choice but to make these deals with them.

428
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,420
Here's another way to reframe Microsoft's motivations in this deal.

429
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,560
Microsoft just wants to sell Azure services and software subscriptions to people that

430
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,700
are creating software that runs on the cloud, because that's a way bigger market than the

431
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,160
home consumer PC.

432
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:34,880
As an example, Visual Studio Enterprise and Visual Studio Professional subscribers, Microsoft

433
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,800
customers, as part of this new deal with Red Hat now, will receive Red Hat Enterprise Linux

434
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
credits.

435
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,340
Developers will be able to deploy Red Hat Enterprise servers as just part of their built-in

436
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:51,700
package they get now, and they can deploy.NET, Java, or any other open source framework

437
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,040
on those Red Hat Enterprise servers running on Azure that Microsoft's paying the bill

438
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
for.

439
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,280
It's corporate synergy.

440
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
Kumbaya, Joe, doesn't it feel great?

441
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,400
Speaking of synergies, you're going to get more Linux on your Windows, even if it's a

442
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,920
Windows ARM system.

443
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,080
Yeah, this is quite surprising.

444
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,880
We've seen the Windows subsystem for Linux as part of Windows 10 since almost the beginning

445
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,260
of Windows 10.

446
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:21,520
And also we've seen Windows 10 being shipped on ARM-based devices fairly recently.

447
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:28,400
But I never expected those ARM devices to be capable of running the subsystem for Linux,

448
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:36,280
because you've already got this compatibility layer going on between x86 and ARM.

449
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:41,560
And now you're going to have this other compatibility layer between the NT kernel and the Linux

450
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,560
userland.

451
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,200
I can't see this working particularly well.

452
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Can you?

453
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,440
Well, they were talking about it at this week's Build conference, because aside from Google

454
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,600
I.O. and aside from Red Hat Summit, there was also the Microsoft Build conference this

455
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
week.

456
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:02,080
And NeoWin spotted a presentation where Microsoft was showing off Ubuntu running on a Windows

457
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,920
10 ARM computer, which if you think about the way it works, if you recall, they're not

458
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,580
emulating with the Windows subsystem for Linux.

459
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,280
They're translating like Wine does.

460
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,060
It's taking a call and it's rerouting it to the Windows equivalent of that call.

461
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:22,920
And if you're doing that with 64 and 32 bit x86 applications, it's really the same math

462
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,680
just with that call redirection on top of it.

463
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,840
There's got to be some overhead there, though, surely.

464
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
I would think so.

465
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,960
And I would not want to use that as my daily driver.

466
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:36,320
But again, if you're on the command line with these small apps, that's not so bad.

467
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,480
The overhead there might be barely noticeable.

468
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,480
Possibly.

469
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,400
I mean, if you're just using it as a replacement for PuTTY, which I would imagine quite a lot

470
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,960
of people are, then you're probably not going to notice.

471
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
Yeah.

472
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,080
But the 12 hour battery life is sort of making it all worth it.

473
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,080
Yeah, I suppose.

474
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,800
And again, this is new Microsoft that we keep talking about.

475
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,440
And it keeps annoying the, shall we say, traditionalists in the Linux community.

476
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,640
I think we just have to accept this, don't we?

477
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,640
I guess so.

478
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,640
They're embracing it.

479
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,640
I suppose so.

480
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,880
I mean, companies will go where the profits flow.

481
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,560
And I did watch the keynote and different presentations from Build and more than a few

482
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,800
times I saw Linux up on stage.

483
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,900
It's still weird to me.

484
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,040
It's still really strange.

485
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:19,640
Or I saw them using SSH a lot, which is always very odd.

486
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:22,000
And all in on the Raspberry Pi, too.

487
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,380
Lots of demos with the Raspberry Pi, which I found to be, well, like I was watching a

488
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:30,880
Google IO keynote, not a Microsoft keynote.

489
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,680
So it is definitely a different time, right?

490
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
It's just where the money is.

491
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
Yeah.

492
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,600
I wonder how much Microsoft stuff you're going to see when you go down to Texas Linux Fest.

493
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,680
Oh, that's right.

494
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,680
I'll be heading down there.

495
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,040
Texas Linux Fest is June 8th through the 9th.

496
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,080
And I'm heading out around the end of May to make the long trek down there.

497
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,080
So if you're in the Austin area, come say hi.

498
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,760
I'll be setting up a Telegram group.

499
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,300
But I'll also have the Rover tracker with me.

500
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:57,540
So if you're along my route, reach out over Telegram or Twitter, and maybe we can meet

501
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,320
up along the way.

502
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,300
That'll all be tracked over at jupitabroadcasting.com slash rover.

503
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,720
And I'll have the Texas Linux Fest Meetup Telegram group at some point.

504
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,280
If you go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash telegram, I'll probably announce it in our main channel.

505
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,240
And while I'm on the road, the show will go on.

506
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,440

512
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,340
I'm at Chris Ellis.

513
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,640
I'm at Joel Rissington.

See you later.

518
00:28:45,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Bye-bye.
