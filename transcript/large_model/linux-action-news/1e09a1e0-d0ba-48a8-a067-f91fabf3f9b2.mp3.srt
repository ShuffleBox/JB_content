00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,880
This is episode 108, recorded on June 2nd, 2019. I'm Chris.

3
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,880
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,560
Hello, Joe. Good to be connected with you. I'm fresh off of Texas Linux Fest, and I think

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,240
I even managed to avoid the Fest hangover this time. I'm getting good at this, Joe.

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,720
What do you say we kick things off with hidden wasp, some Linux malware?

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,340
Yeah, this is quite an unusual bit of Linux malware in that it's not a crypto miner,

8
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:45,200
and it's not just a botnet that's designed to do DDoSs and stuff. It seems to be fairly

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,880
targeted and designed to take over machines completely.

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,600
Yeah, it's not really about mining crypto. It's more about command and control. And I

11
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,720
think one of the interesting things about this one, it's like three different projects

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,040
mashed together into one Frankenstein piece of malware. That's not something we've seen

13
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,280
a lot of. And some of it's from like open public code, and some of it's from some well-known

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,960
malware. And despite the fact that it's this Frankenstein based on known malware, most

15
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,960
detection systems haven't been catching it.

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,000
This is not really one of those stories where you have to worry about your box being vulnerable.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,440
I mean, I suppose theoretically it's possible. But generally, according to initial research

18
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:32,080
so far, it seems that the systems are already compromised in some way. And then this is

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:39,600
left behind to use it, to manipulate it, to control it, and not necessarily used to like

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,880
steal CPU cycles or route mail or anything like that. And it's really kind of early days

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,960
right now, because we've only gotten a couple of files to look at, some bash scripts and

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,560
whatnot.

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,640
And they think that the main way that the malware is used is really just to kind of

24
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,640
keep control of the systems that have already been ransacked, which I think is fascinating.

25
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,720
And it doesn't seem very professional either, does it? Because they've just mashed all these

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,440
different things together to create this new hybrid beast.

27
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,100
Well, isn't that the spirit of open source? Take existing stuff and put it together to

28
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,240
make something better?

29
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,080
I agree. It's just the article that we've linked in ours sort of tries to really kind

30
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,920
of point the finger at China as a state-sponsored attack. But it doesn't really seem like it's

31
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,000
very sophisticated, like a state wouldn't necessarily just mash something like this

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,920
together. They'd probably create one unified piece of attack code.

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,120
At least traditionally, that's the case. Who knows? I mean, I'm just sitting here speculating

34
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,300
because it's just one of these fascinating stories where it's not a big threat, but it's

35
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:46,460
a weird beast that's going by undetected. And a lot of times that's the case with these

36
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,660
vulnerabilities is people are chaining a series of vulnerabilities together. So you get onto

37
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,640
the box, and you get what you need. But then how do you retain control, right? Each one

38
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,640
of those is an individual problem, getting into the box, executing what you need done,

39
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,400
and then retaining control, three separate problems. And this is solving just the latter

40
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
one.

41
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,480
Well, it wasn't the only security issue this week. There was also yet another vulnerability

42
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,480
in Docker.

43
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,680
In the show notes, we'll have a link to a great write up by Dennis Fisher, who breaks

44
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,820
down both sides of the argument here. You have the researchers case, and then you have

45
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,240
Docker responding, and I'll get to both of it too briefly. But from a high level, the

46
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,600
flaw is a weakness that results in a race condition in Docker. And there's already a

47
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,640
fix that's in the works, but there's also a workaround you could already take advantage

48
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,960
of. And like our previous story, you already have to be on the box to take advantage of

49
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:45,120
this flaw. And I think that's really key here, because with this particular flaw, and the

50
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,240
last one we just discussed with the malware, if somebody's already on your system and executing

51
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:56,120
that code and has access to these things, you're already messed up. A line has been

52
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,000
already crossed.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,560
So it's funny too, because this is like the simplest thing to check this out. It's a bug

54
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,280
that's a result of the way Docker handles symbolic links. And it was discovered by security

55
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:14,000
researchers that in some situations, an attacker can insert their own symlink into a path during

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,600
a very short time window. I'm saying like in some cases, a millisecond or so of a time

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,120
window between the time that the path has been resolved, and then the time that it's

58
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,240
operated on. So this is a tiny, tiny fraction of time in there. An attacker could add that

59
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,080
link to something that's on the root file system of the host, and get out of containment

60
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,200
and get access to something on there. This happens when somebody executes Docker CP.

61
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,960
That's when this opportunity comes up. Because when you run Docker CP, it's giving you read

62
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:49,360
write access to the host file system. The obvious and super easy solution is, A, make

63
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,440
sure your containers are secure, and B, pause the container when you use Docker CP. And

64
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,720
that solves the problem.

65
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,640
But that's not always possible when those containers are in production.

66
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,600
Yeah, I suppose so. And that's definitely not ideal. I think Docker plans later on to

67
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,840
upstream this as the default behavior in future releases of Docker, even later this year.

68
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,680
And what they'll do is it'll just be a very, very brief pause. You execute the copy command,

69
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,560
it pauses for a few microseconds, and then it completes, or however long it takes, and

70
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
then it unpauses.

71
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,800
But Docker doesn't seem to think this is that serious, because it's such an edge case. And

72
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,040
that's why they were kind of willing to let this vulnerability go out there into the wild

73
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
before they had a fix ready for it.

74
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,400
Yeah, the Docker official said in a statement that the attack scenario needed to exploit

75
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,320
this vulnerability is quote, rare, slash unlikely. And that in the next monthly update, they'll

76
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,640
have the fix merged. In the meantime, use Docker pause, and in the future release, they'll

77
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,480
have Docker pause automatically.

78
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,880
Well this week saw a release of a bit of software that I have been using since the very beginning

79
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,840
of my Linux journey. And I can't believe that after 15 years, it is finally getting to a

80
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,400
1.0 release. And that is G parted.

81
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,760
Such great software. Really have so much appreciation for this team. And it is so cool to see this

82
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,480
happen after 15 years. And which, I don't know, at this point, it almost feels like

83
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,680
a meme. This release completes the migration to GTK 3.

84
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
Yeah.

85
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,900
There's a couple other things besides just switching to GTK 3, though, that jumped out

86
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,320
at me. I thought this was one of the features that was already in there. Maybe I was running

87
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,400
an early build, but they've added the ability to save your partition layout to an HTML file,

88
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,680
which is really nice for documentation purposes.

89
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,260
There's a couple of other noteworthy changes in here. Number one is they've improved the

90
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:47,400
refresh of NTFS file systems. They say it's a fix for slow refreshing of NTFS. And then

91
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,800
in the bug fix section of the release notes, they note, we've removed support for the ButterFS

92
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Progues utilities to manage the ButterFS file system. So it appears that they've removed,

93
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,200
even if the underlying distribution has BTRFS Progues installed, they don't support it in

94
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,800
G parted 1.0 anymore. I think that's what I'm reading here, Joe.

95
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Yeah, it certainly looks that way. But then again, who's using ButterFS these days? Oh

96
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,800
yeah. I'm Sousa.

97
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,880
Besides, everybody knows the future is BcacheFS. Everybody knows that. Actually, I think the

98
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,560
reality is, at least for future technologies, Unity is looking really strong. And they have

99
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,000
a brand new announcement for Linux users.

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,480
We're not talking about the desktop environment for Ubuntu here. We're talking about the game

101
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:42,000
engine. And they've announced that the Linux version of Unity editor has got official Linux

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
support now.

103
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,600
I struggle to be excited because I've been underwhelmed by more Unity based games that

104
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,480
I have been excited by them. But it's also one of those Electron style compromises. And

105
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:00,280
I don't mean to ascribe the performance comparisons there. I'm just talking about, it's a bit

106
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:04,560
of a, what do you call it? Common denominator? Is that the right term? A common denominator

107
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,840
where it's, you can't really go all in because you're not writing natively for that platform.

108
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,360
You're kind of targeting a common problem set. And that's sometimes good though, because

109
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,840
it means it opens up the door to a lot more games. And it means that people can actually

110
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,480
now do some of that game production on a Linux desktop, which means more desktop users. But

111
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,360
it also means these games might be just a little more refined under Linux now. It's

112
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,240
probably not going to take off like Wildfire, but it appears they're doing this based on

113
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,920
customer demand, which is a great sign, Joe.

114
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:41,440
It is a good sign. And they have offered experimental and unofficial builds for quite a long time.

115
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,080
But now it's good to see that because of commercial pressures, they're actually going official

116
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,040
with it and they're going to properly support it. But it's not just for games, is it? There

117
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:01,640
are other industries that can utilize the engine for various 3D stuff. Things like the

118
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,440
automotive industry and of course the movie industry and even some manufacturing and stuff.

119
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,640
And so it goes to show that even if gaming on Linux isn't massively big, those other

120
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,640
industries are adopting Linux across the board. And they've been using it on the server for

121
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,960
a long time, but maybe more and more so on the desktop.

122
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,920
So let's look at these desktop specs they have here. They want you to run either Ubuntu

123
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,740
16.04 or 18.04. So you need to be on one of the LTSs for the supported configuration.

124
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:41,440
Your mileage may vary. Or CentOS 7 is acceptable. It needs to be the x86-64 architecture. And

125
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,480
here's an interesting requirement. GNOME Desktop is a requirement running on X. No Wayland

126
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,440
for you and no plasma if you want, again, a supported configuration. And then they require

127
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:00,800
you to use either the NVIDIA official proprietary graphics or the AMD Mesa graphics driver.

128
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,800
And they recommend a full desktop form factor running on a device or slash hardware with

129
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,500
no emulation or compatibility layers. So my PCIe pass-through setup is out.

130
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,320
I'm sure that XFC would be fine with this. Of course.

131
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:26,100
But realistically, they have to set some standards here and say these are the supported configurations

132
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,440
and these are what we recommend for a best experience.

133
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,000
Yeah, it's kind of impressive. It's not just Ubuntu 16.04. End of sentence.

134
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,360
Yeah, that's true. And it sounds like it is going to work perfectly well on other systems,

135
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,760
but they just have to set some standards, don't they? They can't support every last

136
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,720
Linux distro and desktop environment and configuration.

137
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,800
Oh, you said standards, Joe. You know how that triggers me these days. The browser vendors

138
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,520
are applying more and more leverage over W3C, the folks that are supposed to be setting

139
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,440
the standards for the World Wide Web. But of course, without the browser vendors being

140
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,160
on board, they don't really have much leverage, do they? You can't really set a standard if

141
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,400
the people that would implement them aren't on board.

142
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:15,240
Well, yeah. And this goes back years, the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working

143
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,680
Group or how would you say the acronym?

144
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
Woodwig.

145
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:27,120
Woodwig, yeah. That's been around since 2004 and has almost been battling with the W3C.

146
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,960
You've got the browser vendors on one side trying to set the standards and W3C on the

147
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,020
other side. And it's kind of gone back and forth. And now it seems the W3C is just kind

148
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:44,120
of folded on this and just accepted the reality that they are going to be dictated to by the

149
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,780
browser manufacturers.

150
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,540
This has been a long time brewing, like you said. I mean, I don't know how else it could

151
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:57,160
have gone down because if you've got Apple, Mozilla, and Opera and generally Google working

152
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,520
outside of what the... I'll give you an example, actually. So this is one of the better examples.

153
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,180
The W3C really wanted to kind of convert the web over to XHTML so everything would have

154
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,840
an XML-like structure, which then the browsers would render for you. But they hated the idea.

155
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:16,100
The browser vendors hated the idea. And from that rebellion against that idea, this is

156
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,520
Chris paraphrasing here, we got the HTML5 standard, which then later on, the W3C later

157
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:26,640
formally approved as the next major iteration of the HTML web standard to sort of make nice

158
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,860
with the browser vendors because they were putting the support behind it and things were

159
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,460
going in the right direction.

160
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:40,080
But this week, things have taken a major shift. In a press release, the W3C and the Wodawig

161
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:46,580
announced that they were finally putting their differences aside and signed a new, quote,

162
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,980
memorandum of understanding.

163
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,900
That's certainly one way to put it, yeah.

164
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:55,920
Yeah. They say, per this new agreement, the W3C is officially giving up publishing of

165
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:05,460
future HTML and DOM standards in favor of Wodawig, again, that's W-H-A-T-W-G, that group

166
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,300
effectively giving them full control, which really means the browser vendors having full

167
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,300
control.

168
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,320
Which ultimately means Google having most of that control.

169
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,060
I do wonder about that. I do wonder if we'll look back in 2025 and look back at May 28th,

170
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:27,860
2019 is the day where something major shifted and the standards, but that body, that group

171
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,300
also, Microsoft sits on there, Apple sits on there, Mozilla's in there, Opera's in that

172
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:38,580
conversation. Really, isn't the solution now just to open that group up a little more?

173
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,160
Because at the end of the day, if they're the ones writing the software, they always

174
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,180
had ultimate control. The W3C has just sort of been a, I mean, it's a theater piece in

175
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,700
a way. They can make good suggestions, but if Firefox and Google alone decide not to

176
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,420
do it, it's like they're effectively powerless.

177
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,980
Well, yeah, and the market will just go to whatever the most popular browser is. Already

178
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:05,980
we're in a situation where some sites just don't work without Chrome. Source Connect,

179
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,900
for example, is a web app that we sometimes use in production that requires Chrome. It's

180
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,660
just got that hard requirement. And I don't really understand why all that underlying

181
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:22,140
technology ought to work in a standards compliant browser like Firefox, but it just doesn't.

182
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,180
There's some interesting parallels here with the free desktop standards and the conversations

183
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:31,780
going on around the desktop and theming for Linux. In fact, I bet you a listener out there

184
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:36,420
knows the perfect XKCD comic they could tweet me at Chris LAS that it's like we set these

185
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,980
standards and then we get all the support behind them and then everybody goes off and

186
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,220
does their own thing. And then we all decide the standards need to be redone completely

187
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:49,940
all over again. And I don't, it's almost like what's the effing point? I mean, not to curse

188
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:53,700
on your show, Joe, but what is the effing point of it all? At the end of the day, it's

189
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,060
like people just want to sit around and make stuff up and then people go off into their

190
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,100
own corners and do their own thing anyways. I find it frustrating.

191
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,780
Yeah. 927, by the way, is that XKCD you're thinking of.

192
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,780
Oh, okay.

193
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,780
How standards proliferate.

194
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,300
Yeah. Oh, that's a good one. But I feel like there's another one where we all go off and

195
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,900
make standards and then throw them out. And I'm not talking about a standard for our standards

196
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,380
either. That's not what we need here.

197
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,260
So tell me about Texas Linux Fest then. How's that been going?

198
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,700
Yeah, Texas Linux Fest was two days here in Irving, Texas, Irving, which is kind of nice

199
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,220
because it's only about 30 or 40 minutes from the Linux Academy office. So I was able to

200
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,500
shoot over here to do the show today. It was good. Friday was kind of slow. It is typically,

201
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,860
you know, when it's a work day, like that first day is usually a little slow going.

202
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,820
But by the second day, it's all the people you saw on Friday, plus a new batch of people.

203
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:49,460
And they kicked off with, I think it was Thomas Cameron is his name, I believe. He's a local

204
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:55,340
log number here and just gave a killer keynote. Both Elle and I just looked at each other

205
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,740
after the keynote and was like, that's one of the best talks we've ever attended at any

206
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,500
conference ever. It was really good. And we got the audio for it. So I'm going to see

207
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,460
if we can release it. And we got some video of it for them too. So we're going to try

208
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,740
to help them release it on their own channels as well.

209
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,540
And it was at the same time, you know, there was a few bumps here and there. But as far

210
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:22,500
as a community event goes, there's something kind of special around the 300 number because

211
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:29,260
you see the same faces five or six, seven times over a weekend. And by day two, everybody

212
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,900
kind of loosens up a little bit because you've been around each other. You've kind of gotten

213
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,580
all the social awkwardness out of the way. And so day two is really casual and it's sort

214
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:44,440
of a very friendly atmosphere. And so I just I really enjoyed the heck out of day two.

215
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,500
And we got a hell of a thunderstorm here. It was raining and lightning like, like only

216
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,140
Texas can provide. It was quite the show. And we had some great meetups, got to get

217
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,660
some good beers and good food, some good company. So all in all, I'm very, very glad I made

218
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:05,380
it down. And I hope they keep growing. I think they might try to go back to Austin possibly.

219
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,000
But I hope they keep it up because it's like, it's like that plucky little conference you

220
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,460
want to see keep going and grow.

221
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,900
And what was the kind of topic trend there then? Was it all about cloud and hybrid cloud

222
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,820
and corporate stuff? Or was it much more community desktop type stuff?

223
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,820
Hmm, good question. You know, I hadn't really I hadn't really kind of thought about it.

224
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:24,940
But as you're asking, I kind of went through it all. And I'd say my first my first hot

225
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:32,140
take on that question would be it was fairly container focused and cloud focused, but not

226
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:38,540
in like the buzzy, commercial cloud sense, but in the I'll give you an example, like

227
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,760
the first talk that was really well attended of the day was about going from a total noob

228
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:47,340
with ansible to going to brilliant. And it was a workshop talk. So about halfway through

229
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,700
the talk, the author takes a 10 minute break puts up the download URLs for virtual machines

230
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,760
and to get configuration files going. And then for the rest of the talk, you work along

231
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,860
with the presenter and get ansible working by the end of the talk. And so it was that

232
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:06,260
kind of stuff. And there was several of those workshops each day, which are very valuable.

233
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:10,520
And there was a there was a really good message underneath it all. And that is, you could

234
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,860
be a Linux admin today. And that's that's a really good living and you've probably got

235
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:22,060
like a good solid 10 years where that's going to be a great living. But at some point, the

236
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:27,600
Linux admin is going to go the way of the Unix admin. And that is to say not going away

237
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,440
completely but becoming much, much more of a niche job. And what is going to take over

238
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,820
is a cloud admin. Now, what does that mean? That's a lot of things. That's understanding

239
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,160
networking, that's understanding Linux basics, that's understanding storage and network storage,

240
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,820
that's understanding network fundamentals, that's understanding how data centers work,

241
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,480
that's understanding how these services work and how to interface with them. It's a very

242
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,020
complex job. But the awesome thing is, is if you're already a Linux admin, or you're

243
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:59,700
even if you have a basic understanding of Linux, you're in a really good position to

244
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,540
leverage that knowledge to pick up those other skill sets and have a really complete skill

245
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,340
set resume. And so you're in a good position for the next 10 years, you just have to act

246
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,260
on it and learn and train yourself up.

247
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,940
It sounds like a really cool conference, then I might have to try and make it over for

248
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,940
next year.

249
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,820
Especially if you like to eat, because there's always really good food in Texas Joe. As my

250
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:24,020
stomach will tell you, it's just a little bit bigger now.

251
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,420
So there's a bit of breaking news that we don't have much info on it's happening as

252
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:33,180
we record. This seems to happen every every Sunday when we record, doesn't it? And that's

253
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,420
the Google Cloud seems to be down.

254
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:41,220
Yeah, which is affecting things in weird ways on the internet right now. So of course, it's

255
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,460
a big topic of conversation. But at the moment, we just have Google status page, not a lot

256
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,100
of information about what's caused the outage or exactly how widespread it is. But what

257
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,000
we do know is I'm in Texas and Joe's in London, and we're both impacted by the outage right

258
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
now.

259
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,340
The document that we used to do this show has been kind of connecting and not working.

260
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,540
It's working right now, but it's been hit and miss. So yes, not sure how bad this is

261
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,900
yet. But if it does turn out to be a bad one, then maybe you can follow up on Linux Unplugged

262
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,900
on Tuesday.

263
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,980
Yeah, if we find out something interesting, I will do that. I will do that. You know,

264
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,740
Joe, sometimes it's just worth self hosting these kinds of things. Maybe this is our lesson.

265
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,660
I know Nextcloud is starting to look more and more attractive to me.

266
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,900
Well, we'll keep an eye on all kinds of things throughout the week and report them here for

267
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,100
you. Check out linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

268

And linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

269
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,220
And speaking of getting trained up, we've released the Don't Be Famous Learning Kubernetes

270
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,740
and Securing Your Cluster talk, which is up on our YouTube channel, youtube.com slash

271
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,420
Jupiter Broadcasting. A great introduction to getting Kubernetes secured away and an

272
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,740
information packed talk in general.

273
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,660
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

274
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,420
I'm at Chris LAS.

275
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,060
I'm at Joe Rissington.

276
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,420
Thanks for joining us. And we will see you next week.

277
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:24,420
See you later.
