Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.120 --> 00:20.440
This is episode 19, recorded on September 17th, 2017.

00:20.440 --> 00:21.440
I'm Chris.

00:21.440 --> 00:22.440
And I'm Joe.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.580
Hello, Joe.

00:23.580 --> 00:27.800
It's good to be with you, but nobody cares about that because it's GNOME Release Week,

00:27.800 --> 00:31.480
and 3.26 has been released.

00:31.480 --> 00:32.480
It has.

00:32.480 --> 00:40.080
And the headline for me is marginal improvements, nothing showstopping, no amazing developments.

00:40.080 --> 00:44.160
It's just kind of polishing and making everything that little bit better.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.640
Is that fair to say?

00:45.640 --> 00:49.240
Maybe from the outside, as a GNOME user, there's quite a few things in here that I think are

00:49.240 --> 00:50.240
pretty great.

00:50.240 --> 00:53.860
And it's also just after their 20th birthday, which is pretty great.

00:53.860 --> 00:58.640
The first new thing that I'm looking forward to is the new settings application, which

00:58.640 --> 01:00.720
has a new navigation sidebar.

01:00.720 --> 01:05.200
Everything's listed on the side, clear, easy to read, good color contrast, so it's quick

01:05.200 --> 01:09.720
to scan through it, Wi-Fi right at the top, which is a frequent thing that I need to get

01:09.720 --> 01:11.200
access to.

01:11.200 --> 01:16.580
And in the browser area, they've added synchronizing with Firefox sync, like we talked about recently.

01:16.580 --> 01:18.200
So that's built in now too.

01:18.200 --> 01:22.480
That settings panel, looking at it, it just feels like why was it not like that before?

01:22.480 --> 01:24.200
That's just how it should be.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.140
Yeah, exactly.

01:26.140 --> 01:28.900
It's something similar to what the Plasma desktop's working on.

01:28.900 --> 01:33.200
And I make an old man joke here when I say this, but it honestly reminds me a lot of

01:33.200 --> 01:38.780
macOS System 6's control panel, where you had just a clear, easy black and white icons

01:38.780 --> 01:43.400
on the left hand side, you clicked mouse or keyboard, and then the respective settings

01:43.400 --> 01:46.360
showed up on the right hand pane, and it works.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.560
So why not use it?

01:47.560 --> 01:51.400
There's a few other things that GNOME users will appreciate.

01:51.400 --> 01:56.540
There's now some nice smooth animations for maximizing and unmaximizing windows and snapping.

01:56.540 --> 02:00.240
They're actually really done well, and elementary OS users are familiar with sort of those

02:00.240 --> 02:01.440
nice perks.

02:01.440 --> 02:07.420
And this is the first release where the GNOME project is recommending Wayland over X11,

02:07.420 --> 02:11.440
because they got a new fancy display setting screen where you can independently control

02:11.440 --> 02:14.320
DPI and resolution settings for different monitors.

02:14.320 --> 02:18.240
I think that might have been from some of the work with our friends at Canonical recently.

02:18.240 --> 02:22.120
And that's baked in, but it only works with Wayland, so they call it a preview mode right

02:22.120 --> 02:23.120
now.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.380
Well, you mentioned Canonical there.

02:25.380 --> 02:29.800
This is going to be the release that's in Ubuntu 17.10, so it's pretty important to

02:29.800 --> 02:30.800
them.

02:30.800 --> 02:31.800
Yeah.

02:31.800 --> 02:33.680
And the crew over at Canonical celebrated.

02:33.680 --> 02:40.440
Will Cook and Popey brought a laptop cake to the release party with GNOME on the display.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.500
You have to go check out Twitter for this.

02:42.500 --> 02:47.120
It's really well done to sort of say, hey, guys, we're happy to celebrate this with you.

02:47.120 --> 02:52.440
And I'm really glad this is the version that's landing in 17.10, because as a pro desktop,

02:52.440 --> 02:59.520
Boxes, the front end to emulation or virtualization, it has added a really nice feature now where

02:59.520 --> 03:03.920
you can share folders between virtual machines and your computers.

03:03.920 --> 03:07.640
You can create one folder in like your home directory, and then your virtual machines

03:07.640 --> 03:11.700
can get access to that folder in your home directory between them.

03:11.700 --> 03:15.320
That's going to be really nice, a big feature for Boxes that I've been waiting for for a

03:15.320 --> 03:16.460
long time.

03:16.460 --> 03:21.120
But just to make things easier in GNOME software, updates are now going to be grouped by type

03:21.120 --> 03:24.520
to provide more accurate progress information when being installed to it.

03:24.520 --> 03:27.240
Core updates, feature updates, things like that.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.760
Similar features have now been added to logs.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.460
It's grouping similar messages together.

03:30.460 --> 03:34.700
And Terminal now makes it easier to work with hyperlinks, so a lot of small little features

03:34.700 --> 03:39.900
that pro users of the GNOME desktop will really appreciate in GNOME 3.26.

03:39.900 --> 03:41.360
One public service announcement.

03:41.360 --> 03:44.260
This is critical to all you GNOME users, I know.

03:44.260 --> 03:47.560
Tweak tool has been renamed to just Tweaks.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.640
You have been warned.

03:50.640 --> 03:54.640
And all joking aside, there is one more big PSA with this release of GNOME.

03:54.640 --> 03:57.880
There are no longer status icons in the bottom left.

03:57.880 --> 04:02.200
That little annoying tabby things that held your Skype icon or your Dropbox or Telegram

04:02.200 --> 04:03.200
icons gone.

04:03.200 --> 04:08.240
And the only way you're getting those suckers back is by using a third party extension like

04:08.240 --> 04:09.240
top icons.

04:09.240 --> 04:13.920
Yeah, that to me is a mistake, I think, because, okay, some of them can be annoying, but some

04:13.920 --> 04:15.720
of them can be really useful as well.

04:15.720 --> 04:19.000
I have one right now for Mumble that is really useful.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.640
So I would definitely be installing that extension if I was a GNOME user.

04:23.640 --> 04:24.640
Yep.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.840
And I think a lot of the distributions that ship GNOME out of the box will just start

04:27.840 --> 04:29.560
shipping that extension now.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.460
And we'll see different ways of implementing that.

04:31.460 --> 04:32.720
Some will do it as a package.

04:32.720 --> 04:36.000
Some will do it as an extension from extensions.gnome.org.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.460
It's going to be a hit and miss on that implementation.

04:38.460 --> 04:40.040
It might be a bumpy ride.

04:40.040 --> 04:44.480
And that's why Plasma fans might be happy with recent discussions going on between the

04:44.480 --> 04:49.440
Plasma camp, guys over at KDE and gals over at KDE, and the Purism camp.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.440
Yeah, we reported on this recently, didn't we?

04:51.440 --> 04:56.840
The Librem 5 from Purism, which is their phone that's going to run GNU slash Linux.

04:56.840 --> 05:00.480
And in all the mockups, I would say screenshots, but they're just mockups, aren't they, at

05:00.480 --> 05:03.120
this stage, it's been GNOME.

05:03.120 --> 05:05.400
And that's what they use on their Pure OS.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.200
So it would make logical sense.

05:07.200 --> 05:12.420
But hang on a second, that's going to take a hell of a lot of development to make work.

05:12.420 --> 05:20.040
And so Matthias Klump, one of the PurOS developers, got in touch with the KDE team via the mailing

05:20.040 --> 05:27.280
list back at the end of August to discuss the possibility of getting Plasma Mobile working

05:27.280 --> 05:30.380
on this, or at least some components of Plasma Mobile.

05:30.380 --> 05:33.360
And now it looks like that is going to happen.

05:33.360 --> 05:37.680
So you're going to actually have a choice between KDE Plasma or GNOME.

05:37.680 --> 05:41.760
That's at least the plan as it stands now, this week, shall we say.

05:41.760 --> 05:45.280
Maybe the most interesting thing about this development is reading the mailing list posts

05:45.280 --> 05:49.420
that Joe found, and we'll have linked in the show notes, because it shows sort of some

05:49.420 --> 05:54.200
real interesting insights into the Librem 5 project.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.420
And it's from an engineer developer's perspective.

05:57.420 --> 05:59.600
So it's just raw information.

05:59.600 --> 06:05.600
And I actually found that more compelling, just reading that mailing post made me want

06:05.600 --> 06:09.740
to back the Librem 5 more than anything written on their actual fundraiser page.

06:09.740 --> 06:16.360
So what I took away from reading those discussions is this truly is what you and I were saying

06:16.360 --> 06:22.640
would be great, which is a open source phone hardware platform that could run basically

06:22.640 --> 06:25.880
anything that you could get installed on it.

06:25.880 --> 06:32.280
And PureOS, which is a Debian derivative, would have a GNOME option or a Plasma option.

06:32.280 --> 06:36.480
And it looks like based on these conversations, the Plasma Mobile stuff that they've been

06:36.480 --> 06:40.840
working on for a while now is a little bit further along and would integrate better with

06:40.840 --> 06:44.600
the whole matrix solution that the Librem 5 would end up using.

06:44.600 --> 06:50.040
Because that matrix solution is a catch-all, it solves web browsing, email, messaging,

06:50.040 --> 06:53.000
calendar and phone calls.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.680
They don't have a huge demand on the phone UI.

06:56.680 --> 07:01.160
And when looking at the different options, it appears the Plasma stuff is further along.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.800
And it's not just you and I who are thinking this.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.480
The folks over at the KDE community have a quote here in the announcement.

07:06.480 --> 07:14.480
They say, having full access to Purism's hardware platform is a dream for the KDE community.

07:14.480 --> 07:18.460
Partnering with Purism allows us to integrate Plasma Mobile seamlessly with a commercial

07:18.460 --> 07:19.920
device for the first time.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.280
And the Librem 5 will make Plasma Mobile shine the way it deserves.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.280
It's very positive.

07:24.280 --> 07:28.200
OK, well, let me be positive for a bit and then characteristically negative afterwards.

07:28.200 --> 07:31.480
So it's definitely a good thing that they're hooking up with Plasma.

07:31.480 --> 07:35.320
Plasma Mobile for me is a great mobile OS.

07:35.320 --> 07:36.880
It's got such great potential.

07:36.880 --> 07:40.740
It's got the groundwork done by their own admission.

07:40.740 --> 07:43.560
It's not really for mainstream consumer use.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.400
And I like the modesty of that.

07:45.400 --> 07:49.600
I like them being realistic about it and saying there's a lot to do on it.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.420
But as you say, it's further along than GNOME.

07:51.420 --> 07:55.960
So I think it is a brilliant choice for them to go that route.

07:55.960 --> 08:01.600
However, this strikes me as disorganized.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.840
Why did they launch saying it was going to be GNOME and now they're saying it's going

08:05.840 --> 08:08.440
to be KDE and probably GNOME as well?

08:08.440 --> 08:13.240
And it just seems like they haven't really got it together properly.

08:13.240 --> 08:14.740
There's no specs for this phone.

08:14.740 --> 08:15.880
It's all just up in the air.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.880
It's kind of just like, well, give us a bunch of money and we'll just trust us.

08:18.880 --> 08:20.560
We'll make something good.

08:20.560 --> 08:22.380
And a lot of people have backed this.

08:22.380 --> 08:26.200
And since the KDE announcement, a lot more money has come in and it's looking like it

08:26.200 --> 08:29.720
might maybe happen now.

08:29.720 --> 08:34.160
But do you see what I mean about it being a bit all over the place?

08:34.160 --> 08:35.160
I do.

08:35.160 --> 08:39.560
What I took away from the discussion in those mailing lists was we think we've got the underlying

08:39.560 --> 08:43.400
base OS because of the hardware platform we've chosen, because of the features that are now

08:43.400 --> 08:47.600
built into the Linux kernel, and because of our PureOS Debian-based derivative.

08:47.600 --> 08:50.220
We think we've got that piece really nailed down.

08:50.220 --> 08:52.480
So we know we can boot a Linux-based OS on this thing.

08:52.480 --> 08:53.760
We're pretty solid on that.

08:53.760 --> 08:57.480
But what we don't have really nailed down is how you're going to tap on this thing to

08:57.480 --> 09:01.840
launch the stuff you need, what that UI looks like, how we present that if we build our

09:01.840 --> 09:02.840
own.

09:02.840 --> 09:07.020
And I would say that is a particularly hard nut to crack.

09:07.020 --> 09:08.360
So I could totally see where you're coming from.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.580
That should be something they have figured out.

09:10.580 --> 09:15.360
The devil's advocate position I'll take in this is you can only fund so much research

09:15.360 --> 09:21.280
and time and development into that initiative until you've been funded.

09:21.280 --> 09:26.880
So because it's such a challenge, it's hard to really justify spending the money on fixing

09:26.880 --> 09:31.280
it until you have an indication that things are going to go that direction.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.280
Am I making any sense?

09:32.280 --> 09:35.840
I'm trying to come up with their position, and I'm probably missing some point.

09:35.840 --> 09:42.000
But I guess that would be my positive devil's advocate response, because mostly, I agree

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
with you, Joe.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.840
Well, yeah, that all makes sense what you said, but they could have had these discussions

09:46.840 --> 09:55.120
with KDE before they launched the CrowdFunder and had more of a firm plan.

09:55.120 --> 10:00.240
I really want it to succeed, I really do, but I just wish they were a bit more organized

10:00.240 --> 10:01.240
with it.

10:01.240 --> 10:04.760
And hopefully, now that is happening, and hopefully, we're going to get a choice of

10:04.760 --> 10:09.480
GNOME or KDE, which would make most people happy.

10:09.480 --> 10:13.760
But I'm telling you, I'd still try and install Xfce on it, just for the lulz.

10:13.760 --> 10:17.120
Well, then maybe Manjaro has just the answer for you, Joe.

10:17.120 --> 10:22.920
Yeah, the new Manjaro laptop, which has been announced in association with Station X, which

10:22.920 --> 10:29.320
is quite a small company based in the UK doing a similar thing to what Entroware does, except

10:29.320 --> 10:35.840
that they, instead of focusing on a narrow range of Linux distros, they basically support

10:35.840 --> 10:37.860
them all.

10:37.860 --> 10:43.640
And now they're going to have a version of their Spitfire, which is basically the same

10:43.640 --> 10:49.020
machine as the Apollo from Entroware or the Galago Pro from System76, only it's going

10:49.020 --> 10:56.080
to be a Manjaro edition with a cool Manjaro logo, laser etched into the back of it, and

10:56.080 --> 10:57.600
some tweaks to Manjaro as well.

10:57.600 --> 11:03.120
So it's not going to be just standard Manjaro, there's kind of kernel tweaks and firmware

11:03.120 --> 11:08.160
stuff to make it work well with the battery and CPU and everything.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.680
So it's very good news for Manjaro.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.640
They've got some hardware out there now.

11:11.640 --> 11:14.080
Yeah, this really seems to be the new thing.

11:14.080 --> 11:17.200
On a totally different scale, this reminds me of the box sets it used to be able to get

11:17.200 --> 11:18.200
for different distributions.

11:18.200 --> 11:22.800
Like I used to get a SUSE box set and a Mandrake box set and a Red Hat that was just six, seven

11:22.800 --> 11:27.320
disks of stuff, and it was like an $80 purchase, but after every major release, I get that

11:27.320 --> 11:28.320
big box.

11:28.320 --> 11:29.680
Now you order a laptop.

11:29.680 --> 11:30.680
And this thing's not bad.

11:30.680 --> 11:31.680
I mean, it's called the Spitfire.

11:31.680 --> 11:32.680
I like that name.

11:32.680 --> 11:38.040
It's got a seventh generation Kaby Lake i7, 32 gigs of RAM, and a bunch of different SSD

11:38.040 --> 11:39.360
and hard drive options.

11:39.360 --> 11:43.340
Pre-orders will begin on October 13th, and they think they'll probably start shipping

11:43.340 --> 11:46.640
the machines by the end of October.

11:46.640 --> 11:50.000
These are Clevo-based machines with the modifications like Joe mentioned.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.360
I'm not huge into the derivative versions landing on these laptops.

11:54.360 --> 11:57.920
One of the things I like about Entraware's implementations is pretty straight implementation.

11:57.920 --> 11:59.160
I like that a lot.

11:59.160 --> 12:03.960
I'm not totally jazzed by the idea of this thing running a slightly different kernel

12:03.960 --> 12:08.580
than main Manjaro, but I'd have to take a look at it first before I made any real judgments

12:08.580 --> 12:09.580
on that.

12:09.580 --> 12:14.040
Well, it is going to be supported by the Manjaro team, and so you can just do updates as you

12:14.040 --> 12:16.400
would normally, and everything should be fine.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.200
So at least they haven't just butchered a version of it on their own.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.720
At least they've been working with the distro to make sure it's all good.

12:23.720 --> 12:29.120
But listening to you talk about this on Linux Unplugged recently, I heard you dissing Manjaro

12:29.120 --> 12:30.120
a lot.

12:30.120 --> 12:36.000
I know you're a kind of hardcore Antegos Arch guy, but you don't like Manjaro by the sounds

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
of things.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.040
Is it just because it's XFCE, or is it because of the updates as well?

12:40.040 --> 12:44.040
I think XFCE is just the icing on the Manjaro cake, Joe.

12:44.040 --> 12:47.480
I just love that aspect of it so much.

12:47.480 --> 12:57.160
But I think Manjaro is a great idea, and I just don't really like the policy of delaying

12:57.160 --> 12:59.280
updates for quote-unquote testing.

12:59.280 --> 13:05.640
I think that is potentially hazardous, and I know they say this isn't the case, but there's

13:05.640 --> 13:09.940
a potential for sometimes security updates to be included as bug fixes, and for those

13:09.940 --> 13:13.160
to be withheld just for quote-unquote testing.

13:13.160 --> 13:19.240
Now say you have a distribution Manjaro size, say they have less than 50,000 users, or even

13:19.240 --> 13:21.360
less than 500,000 users.

13:21.360 --> 13:26.920
There's only a few maybe 10,000 people that are running on the testing version, and then

13:26.920 --> 13:31.960
between that 10,000 user base, there's even a smaller subset that are using the same packages

13:31.960 --> 13:36.480
and versions that you are on the same spin that you are.

13:36.480 --> 13:40.520
And so there's actually really no real-world testing that happens there.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.860
This isn't Debian.

13:41.860 --> 13:42.860
This isn't Red Hat.

13:42.860 --> 13:49.620
So to me, it feels more like stability theater than actual Arch with safety bumpers.

13:49.620 --> 13:53.680
But it works for people, and the defaults are nice, the desktop configurations are nice,

13:53.680 --> 13:59.000
performance optimizations are very nice, Manjaro was one of the first places to do some of

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
those things.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.320
So I like all of those things about Manjaro, I just wish there was an option when I logged

14:04.320 --> 14:09.040
in to check a box and just switch all of my repositories to Arch, and have everything

14:09.040 --> 14:10.040
still work.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.960
Then I think I'd probably be in the sweet spot with Manjaro.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.840
Yeah, I don't mind that today, I disagree to some extent.

14:14.840 --> 14:21.480
I think that there is enough testing of it, albeit it's not a lot of testing, but I think

14:21.480 --> 14:26.280
you only need a little bit to justify the delay, because it's only a slight delay as

14:26.280 --> 14:27.280
well.

14:27.280 --> 14:33.240
And as you say, proper security patches get pushed straight away, so it is really just

14:33.240 --> 14:34.240
bug fixes.

14:34.240 --> 14:39.420
And I know, okay, sometimes bug fixes can be security fixes as well.

14:39.420 --> 14:43.600
So I can see where you're coming from, but I have a real soft spot for Manjaro, because

14:43.600 --> 14:46.440
I've installed Arch, it's a huge pain.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.660
And Turgos, I've just had bad experiences with, I can't even remember why.

14:49.660 --> 14:52.840
And I've always enjoyed using Manjaro when I've used it.

14:52.840 --> 14:58.000
And having a really nice XFCE setup with Numix icons, and everything looks nice to me when

14:58.000 --> 14:59.040
I've used it.

14:59.040 --> 15:05.040
So it's kind of my backup if I ever want to go down that rolling route and have a nice

15:05.040 --> 15:06.320
XFCE desktop.

15:06.320 --> 15:11.080
So yeah, I just felt a bit slighted here and you dissed my beloved Manjaro.

15:11.080 --> 15:17.680
Well, I'm glad you're here to defend them, because I think they do deserve some defense.

15:17.680 --> 15:24.200
I would conclude my other problem with the separate software repos is it's a separate

15:24.200 --> 15:28.640
set of infrastructure to manage, which they have had some accidents a couple of times

15:28.640 --> 15:29.740
in the past.

15:29.740 --> 15:33.400
It's a different area of their expertise that's going to always be stressed and won't be the

15:33.400 --> 15:35.440
primary focus for them.

15:35.440 --> 15:38.240
And it's something that's particularly harder for a small team to pull off.

15:38.240 --> 15:43.620
The infrastructure around it, the security around it, just reauthorizing your SSL certs.

15:43.620 --> 15:47.700
If they were using mainline arch repositories, this would be something that the distribution

15:47.700 --> 15:50.280
didn't even have to worry about, didn't even have to focus.

15:50.280 --> 15:54.260
And they could spend the rest of their time and resources on making that desktop even better.

15:54.260 --> 15:57.520
But I'm glad it works, and maybe one day I'll give it another spin.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.800
I did try it for a while, and I was impressed.

15:59.800 --> 16:04.840
And it functionally worked great for me.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.060
LAS.ting.com, L-A-S.ting.com.

16:07.060 --> 16:08.360
It's a smarter way to do mobile.

16:08.360 --> 16:13.180
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone, because it's $6 for a line and then just your

16:13.180 --> 16:15.680
minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

16:15.680 --> 16:20.240
I got an unbelievable story in Discord in the haircare channel, if you want to go check

16:20.240 --> 16:24.520
it for yourself, from a listener who signed up for Ting.

16:24.520 --> 16:28.680
And Hurricane Irma came in, knocked out their internet.

16:28.680 --> 16:33.260
They switched on their Ting device, just tapped the hotspot mode, because it's in there.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.480
If you want to use it as a data device, go ahead.

16:35.480 --> 16:38.280
They turned it on, and they ended up with an $80 bill.

16:38.280 --> 16:41.520
It's the largest Ting bill they've ever got, because they used a lot of data.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.880
They were their primary connection.

16:43.880 --> 16:47.200
And they emailed Ting and explained what happened.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.240
And Ting knocked it down to, I think it was $60 or $20.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.420
They took a huge chunk out, because they're a great company.

16:52.420 --> 16:56.940
And they've been around for a while now, because it's two cows that owns them.

16:56.940 --> 17:01.520
And they've built a company around really doing mobile in a different way.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.160
They don't have to worry about building the antennas.

17:03.160 --> 17:07.440
Instead, they worry about building a great system around it with an easy-to-use dashboard,

17:07.440 --> 17:10.200
simple to understand plans, GSM and CDMA networks.

17:10.200 --> 17:15.320
You can bring your own device, $6 for the baseline, minutes, messages, megabytes, whatever

17:15.320 --> 17:16.960
you use, whatever features you want.

17:16.960 --> 17:17.960
It's there.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.540
It's nationwide coverage with no contracts.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.600
Go to last.ting.com.

17:21.600 --> 17:22.600
That's last.ting.com.

17:22.600 --> 17:35.160
OK, let's talk about Blueborn, the big vulnerability of basically all Bluetooth devices, including

17:35.160 --> 17:41.760
Android and Linux that was announced this week with a cool logo and everything and cool

17:41.760 --> 17:43.800
website.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.120
This looks like a really big deal.

17:46.120 --> 17:49.560
But somehow, I'm not that worried about it.

17:49.560 --> 17:52.640
Yeah, as Linux users, we might be in the best position.

17:52.640 --> 17:56.160
As always, Android users are in the worst position.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.360
And Apple users are not affected at all.

17:58.360 --> 17:59.600
And here's the really fun part.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.800
The attack does not require that your device be paired.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.280
Does not have to even be discoverable.

18:06.280 --> 18:11.000
It just requires at the time that you have an active Bluetooth connection.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.960
So if you connect to a car stereo or a headphone or a speaker, it will take over that connection

18:16.960 --> 18:17.960
essentially.

18:17.960 --> 18:18.960
It can do man-in-the-middle attacks.

18:18.960 --> 18:24.720
And in some situations, depending on the vulnerability, it can execute remote code, mostly on Android

18:24.720 --> 18:25.720
devices.

18:25.720 --> 18:30.680
Yeah, which is actually the only worrying bit to me because Linux, I barely use Bluetooth,

18:30.680 --> 18:31.680
if at all.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.240
So I'm not worried about that.

18:33.240 --> 18:38.000
But Android, OK, so I'm using Lineage, and I haven't quite got the update yet.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.320
I'm expecting that in a couple of days.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.400
So that should be fine.

18:42.400 --> 18:49.420
But my smartwatch, my Sony smartwatch 3, which is never getting another update, that's vulnerable.

18:49.420 --> 18:52.520
And is that going to let people get into my phone?

18:52.520 --> 18:53.760
Maybe.

18:53.760 --> 18:56.240
Is your smartwatch Bluetooth or is it Bluetooth LE?

18:56.240 --> 18:58.960
Bluetooth LE connections are not vulnerable to this attack.

18:58.960 --> 19:01.060
No, it's not LE as far as I know.

19:01.060 --> 19:03.360
So I am basically screwed.

19:03.360 --> 19:09.760
Yeah, that means you're probably vulnerable to all four CVEs on Android, which do result

19:09.760 --> 19:14.720
in information leaks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and remote code execution.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.960
Google Pixels are getting the patches already.

19:16.960 --> 19:21.260
Google has notified OEMs and provided code upstream.

19:21.260 --> 19:24.800
But of course, it's up to every ODM and OEM to patch.

19:24.800 --> 19:28.740
Linux 3.3 and later are affected by this.

19:28.740 --> 19:34.120
And any Linux system using BlueZ is also affected by this vulnerability.

19:34.120 --> 19:38.480
All those vendors, supposedly, vendors being distribution maintainers in this case, have

19:38.480 --> 19:39.600
been notified as well.

19:39.600 --> 19:43.480
I've always pronounced it as Blues, I don't know, it's one of those things that you don't

19:43.480 --> 19:44.480
really say much.

19:44.480 --> 19:45.480
Oh, yeah.

19:45.480 --> 19:46.480
Yeah.

19:46.480 --> 19:47.480
Blues Zed.

19:47.480 --> 19:48.480
Yeah.

19:48.480 --> 19:52.480
But the reality is, there are going to be millions, if not billions of Android devices

19:52.480 --> 19:57.960
out there that are not going to get patched against this for a long, long time.

19:57.960 --> 20:02.040
So are we going to start seeing this get exploited on a major scale?

20:02.040 --> 20:04.000
It looks like it's quite straightforward to do.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
So maybe.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
Yeah.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.760
Add this to the list of millions and millions of different types of attacks that are out

20:09.760 --> 20:11.960
there on unpatched devices.

20:11.960 --> 20:18.040
But this just seems to be the new world we live in because we've got Bluetooth in everything

20:18.040 --> 20:23.960
from toaster ovens to every watch and smartphone sold these days, and cameras.

20:23.960 --> 20:26.040
So that ship has sailed, Joe.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.360
That ship has sailed.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.920
What we need is public code for all of the things.

20:29.920 --> 20:34.040
Yeah, especially if public money is being spent on that.

20:34.040 --> 20:39.640
And so the FSFE, the Free Software Foundation Europe, have launched public money, public

20:39.640 --> 20:47.120
code, which is a website and a campaign with a nice video which explains in quite a clunky

20:47.120 --> 20:53.600
way, I think, but never mind, how if you're going to spend public money on code being

20:53.600 --> 20:58.200
written, then it damn well should be released under an open source license.

20:58.200 --> 21:02.560
And this is something I've been talking about for years and we all have surely because it

21:02.560 --> 21:10.120
just it's outrageous that they spend public money on code and software that's proprietary

21:10.120 --> 21:12.840
and that we can't all benefit from.

21:12.840 --> 21:13.840
Yeah.

21:13.840 --> 21:18.640
In the big picture, it locks government into contracts where vendors can exploit them.

21:18.640 --> 21:22.080
And that exploitation results in lots of public funds.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.320
There is an obvious counter argument to this.

21:25.320 --> 21:31.300
And that counter argument would be national security secrets, secret patented code that

21:31.300 --> 21:34.440
has to be used for certain things.

21:34.440 --> 21:37.680
But government is so much more than just national security.

21:37.680 --> 21:38.680
You have local government.

21:38.680 --> 21:42.800
Here in the United States, we have the National Park Services and state governments that could

21:42.800 --> 21:46.120
all use this, wildlife agencies.

21:46.120 --> 21:50.280
There's no reason that this couldn't be widely adopted wherever applicable.

21:50.280 --> 21:54.960
There's 7,218 signatures right now on this open letter.

21:54.960 --> 22:00.680
I also take pause in trying to force any technological decision via legislation.

22:00.680 --> 22:04.400
It seems like if open source is competitively better, it would eventually just take over

22:04.400 --> 22:05.480
in government.

22:05.480 --> 22:11.000
And to that point, at FOSDOM 2017, there was a talk about the gaining momentum of open

22:11.000 --> 22:15.420
source in government, which is a good talk if you want to go look it up, it's audio.

22:15.420 --> 22:18.620
So it does seem to be already picking up some momentum.

22:18.620 --> 22:23.000
In this case, because it is public money, I do think that stuff, whenever possible,

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
should be open.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.240
And whenever it can't be open, there needs to be some sort of documented reason why,

22:27.240 --> 22:28.800
and explain what the functionality is.

22:28.800 --> 22:33.680
Yeah, if it's kind of weapons systems or whatever, then that kind of makes sense.

22:33.680 --> 22:39.920
But if it's, I don't know, the software running a library or whatever, there's just no reason

22:39.920 --> 22:42.640
why that shouldn't be open.

22:42.640 --> 22:46.520
Public code.eu if you want to sign the open letter.

22:46.520 --> 22:49.600
Maybe you could do that in a Firefox multi-account container.

22:49.600 --> 22:53.200
Yeah, is this going to be enough to tempt you back to Firefox, Chris?

22:53.200 --> 22:54.200
I wonder.

22:54.200 --> 22:58.080
I've been using Firefox for a long time, well, forever, pretty much.

22:58.080 --> 23:01.640
And I have Chrome installed generally, but I stick to Firefox.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.360
And now I've got even more reason to use it.

23:04.360 --> 23:08.600
So multi-account containers, it's quite straightforward.

23:08.600 --> 23:15.160
You set up your containers, and you can log into sites in different tabs as different

23:15.160 --> 23:18.520
identities completely, because they're totally containerized.

23:18.520 --> 23:24.320
So for example, the Google Suite, you can log into your Gmail and your drive and everything

23:24.320 --> 23:27.520
with one tab in one account, and then a totally different account.

23:27.520 --> 23:30.360
So I might have my personal account, and then I might have an account for one of the shows

23:30.360 --> 23:31.560
that I do.

23:31.560 --> 23:36.200
And so this, I've tested out already, is all immediately useful to me.

23:36.200 --> 23:41.280
So well done, Mozilla, for coming up with an official extension to do this.

23:41.280 --> 23:46.560
And my next question is, should it be integrated into mainline Firefox without an extension?

23:46.560 --> 23:48.160
I don't know about that.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.160
I don't know.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.820
Is it bloat, or is it useful?

23:50.820 --> 23:52.740
It's useful for me.

23:52.740 --> 23:58.240
As long as it's an extension that's kind of freely available, that's probably enough.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.080
I say yes and yes to both your questions.

24:00.080 --> 24:04.260
It is tempting me more and more, as Chrome is pissing me off more and more.

24:04.260 --> 24:05.760
And I think it should be built in.

24:05.760 --> 24:10.600
It does add bloat, but it reduces bloat on my system in another way, which is running

24:10.600 --> 24:16.040
three browsers at once, plus one browser with another window open in incognito mode.

24:16.040 --> 24:20.480
Because I'm in all kinds of accounts for the different shows all day long, plus my own

24:20.480 --> 24:23.040
personal accounts and my work accounts.

24:23.040 --> 24:27.320
So I would use the snot out of this feature, and I would probably be running less instances

24:27.320 --> 24:30.420
of Chrome and GNOME Web if I could use this.

24:30.420 --> 24:34.600
So again, I'm thinking it's time for me to take Firefox way more seriously.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.240
And I love that they're building in these advanced features.

24:37.240 --> 24:38.800
There's one major limitation.

24:38.800 --> 24:40.920
It's super obvious if you think about it.

24:40.920 --> 24:45.040
Firefox sync is only going to work with one quote unquote account slash container.

24:45.040 --> 24:47.100
So you can only have one sync account.

24:47.100 --> 24:52.280
You can have multiple containers for different online accounts, but only one Firefox sync

24:52.280 --> 24:53.440
account for the browser.

24:53.440 --> 24:54.440
That's kind of obvious.

24:54.440 --> 24:55.440
Yeah.

24:55.440 --> 24:58.200
So does this smell like a Firefox challenge?

24:58.200 --> 24:59.200
Yeah.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.200
Maybe after I get back from New York, this might be the time to give it a go.

25:02.200 --> 25:06.360
Because you know, also in the next couple of months, version 57 ships with the new interface.

25:06.360 --> 25:07.360
Yeah.

25:07.360 --> 25:08.640
I think it's getting close, Joe.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.240
There might be time to jump on board.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.240
Yeah.

25:11.240 --> 25:14.360
Just when I keep thinking about moving to Chrome, Mozilla pulls stuff like this and

25:14.360 --> 25:17.360
makes me think, yeah, I'll stick around for a little bit longer.

25:17.360 --> 25:19.160
Stick around just that little bit longer.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.240
Well we hope you guys will stick around for a little bit longer too.

25:21.240 --> 25:25.140
Go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

25:25.140 --> 25:27.760
I won't be here next week, but the show will go on.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.720
I'll be in NYC for the Ubuntu rally.

25:30.720 --> 25:34.080
I'll be on my way to NYC by the time the first episode airs.

25:34.080 --> 25:35.460
I'll be missing two weeks.

25:35.460 --> 25:42.120
You can follow my live progress at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash rover, where I'll also post episodes

25:42.120 --> 25:43.280
from the Ubuntu rally.

25:43.280 --> 25:47.720
So all that live tracking and episodes that I publish from there, jupiterbroadcasting.com

25:47.720 --> 25:48.720
slash rover.

25:48.720 --> 25:49.720
Yeah.

25:49.720 --> 25:53.480
So stick around for a couple of guest hosts while Chris is away.

25:53.480 --> 25:57.680
And if you go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact, you'll find all the ways to get in

25:57.680 --> 25:58.840
touch with us.

25:58.840 --> 26:04.120
And you can support the network and our coverage of Linux and open source over at patreon.com

26:04.120 --> 26:05.880
slash Jupiter signal.

26:05.880 --> 26:10.640
So I'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

26:10.640 --> 26:12.680
I'm at Chris LAS.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.240
I'm at Joe Rissington.

26:14.240 --> 26:17.200
Thank you for joining us and he'll see you next week.

26:17.200 --> 26:35.760
See you later.
