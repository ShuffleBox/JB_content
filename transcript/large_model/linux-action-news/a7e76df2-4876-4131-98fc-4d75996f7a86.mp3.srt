00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,120
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,720
This is episode 30, recorded on December 3rd, 2017. I'm Chris.

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,720
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,560
Hello, Joe. It's good to be connected with you again. And now that you're a Bitcoin investor,

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,520
I feel like we should start this week with a little Bitcoin news. The open source money

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:36,160
has reached $11,000 as we record this episode.

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,200
Yeah, the big news was 10,000. But it's been pretty volatile since then. I've seen it down

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:49,760
as low as, I think, just under nine and up nearly 12. But yeah, kind of 10 or 11. That

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,560
is big news, though. It's a psychological barrier, isn't it, to get over 10? And people

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:01,240
have gone crazy as a result. Even I have sold my Litecoin. And by Litecoin, I mean singular

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:07,480
Litecoin. And now I've got like 0.0 something Bitcoin. Yes, it's still worth like 500 pounds,

12
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
though.

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,560
Yeah, those of us who have been following the Bitcoin phenomenon now for years know

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,800
that right now there is just an incredible level of transaction volume. As we record

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:24,640
this episode, the value of Bitcoin is changing faster than I could read it to you. It's really

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,160
something to see it. It's a new level of adoption for Bitcoin when it reaches this $10,000,

17
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:37,200
this big number. It's so much more than Bitcoin. It's a validation of the blockchain technology.

18
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,620
Because what it is saying is that all of these millions of people are willing to store their

19
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:47,480
value in a blockchain technology, which, by the way, is open source. And a lot of companies

20
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,480
are trying to crack that particular nut right now.

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,480
You do realize that it jumped the shark this week, of course, though, because it was on

22
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,600
the Big Bang Theory. Oh, was it? Yeah, it was pretty funny. They must have filmed it

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:06,840
several months ago because they're like, it's worth over $5,000. Yeah, yeah. Well, ish.

24
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,320
This is all sort of fluctuating as we record, but it's around a market value of $180 billion

25
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,840
right now, which is a substantial amount more than, say, General Electric, just as a reference

26
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,920
point. Yeah, it's bigger than some countries, isn't it? It is indeed. And so if you're not

27
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,880
a... If you haven't followed Bitcoin very closely, or if you're even a little skeptical,

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,360
you might be wondering, has people just completely lost their mind? And perhaps, perhaps, but

29
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,000
I think what you're seeing here is a validation in a couple of fundamental factors. A validation

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,760
in a currency that is verified via crypto, that's a pretty big winner for Bitcoin. And

31
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,600
then a currency that has a shared public ledger, where everything is committed, and then it

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,440
is permanently committed. And these two technologies coming together, all being open source out

33
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:03,120
in the public, break down national barriers. So it's a bigger thing than it is in, say,

34
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,140
the US or any of the Western countries. Because in the Western countries, we have a pretty

35
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,960
stable currency. We generally have governments that are considered fairly stable. And their

36
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,660
currencies, particularly in my case, their currencies are accepted all over the world.

37
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,320
Cash is great. Everybody loves cash, the businessman to the terrorist. They all love using cash.

38
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,560
So when you're in the US, you look at this and you go, what is going on with this Bitcoin

39
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,720
stuff? This is crazy. But when you're in China, when you're in Iran, when you're somewhere

40
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,240
in like Yemen, it's a completely different story. And they have a completely different

41
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,320
perspective. And that's going to continue to be the case for Bitcoin for a long time.

42
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:51,320
We're at the very beginning here. This stuff, the currency aspect of it, is just the tip

43
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
of the iceberg.

44
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,280
Well, I know that we're not quite at the end of the year yet. So we're not quite at predictions.

45
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,280
But this time next year, where do you see it being? I know that you're very reluctant

46
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,480
to be pressed on this. But do you think that it's going to be anywhere near where it is

47
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,240
now? Or is it going to be way more or way less?

48
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Well, I'll give you my framework that I use to think about it. I don't know if I'm going

49
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,600
to be right or not. But my framework is this. If we thought it was worth $100, and then

50
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,360
we thought it was worth $500, and then people were willing to buy it at $1,000, and then

51
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:31,240
all of a sudden $5,000, and now $10,000, then what stops us from thinking it's worth $15,000?

52
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:38,660
What stops us from thinking it's worth $20,000, $25,000, $50,000? I don't know where it goes.

53
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,480
It's a limited commodity. And there's a lot of use cases, from crime to legitimate trust

54
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:51,320
transactions with Bitcoin. I got to think that there's going to be a drop. There generally

55
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,460
is. Generally, these rides come with a lot of falls. That tends to be Bitcoin's history.

56
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,080
So it's pretty hard to pin where it's going to be at. But it could become a new normal.

57
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,160
$10,000 could become a new normal, just like $7,000 became a new normal and $5,000 became

58
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
a new normal. We'll see.

59
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,240
Right. I take that as $100,000 then.

60
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,040
Maybe. I hope so.

61
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:18,040
The way I see it, this time next year, it's either going to be worth $100,000 or under

62
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:23,480
$100,000. How ridiculous is that? That's how volatile it is as a currency.

63
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,840
Yeah, that's true. You know what's been surprising to me and something I really didn't expect

64
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,640
is as it's gotten closer to $10,000, more normal people have all of a sudden gotten

65
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:38,600
really interested. People that were never taking Bitcoin seriously are all of a sudden

66
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:45,040
investing in Bitcoin. Because you don't have to buy one $10,000 coin. You can buy fractions

67
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,960
of a Bitcoin. You can just buy in little itty-bitsy tiny bits. And this idea seems to be really

68
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,880
taking off in more well-to-do upper middle class Americans right now. And I'm very surprised

69
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,840
by it. And I started to see it within some members of my family. But I'm seeing it way,

70
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,960
way more in people that are sending me emails asking about it. It's all of a sudden gotten

71
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,200
a level of legitimacy. And in my world, when it reached $1,000, I said to myself, I don't

72
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,040
know if I'm ever going to, I will never buy a Bitcoin again. Maybe I'll try to mine an

73
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:21,520
alt crypto, but I'm never going to buy a Bitcoin. $1,000? No way. But for a different category

74
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,280
of investor, if you want to call them that, $10,000 is all of a sudden bringing a level

75
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,200
of legitimacy to it that has turned their interest in, which I did not see coming. So

76
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,960
it's really hard to peg this stuff.

77
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,320
Yeah. And what about the forks then, like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold? They are not doing

78
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,120
as well as they had hoped, but they haven't damaged Bitcoin at all. In fact, they've almost

79
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,760
legitimized it.

80
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,480
Yeah. The thing about Bitcoin that is hard to understand is what gives it value is the

81
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,320
fact that we're willing to give it value. And I think that means original Bitcoin will

82
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:59,880
always have the most value because that's the thing collectively we've all decided to

83
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:05,480
give value. The only reason gold has value is because it can be applied to many industrial

84
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,240
applications and we've all decided that this shiny rock is valuable. To bring it to more

85
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,960
current terms, the only reason the dollar has any value is because it's something we

86
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,320
all agree has value and the federal government accepts it to pay taxes. But it's just, it's

87
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,880
something we've all collectively agreed upon. If tomorrow President Trump declared that

88
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,800
we'd all have to use the Trumpian to pay our taxes and pay for goods and buy gas and groceries,

89
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,000
the market would pretty quickly switch over to Trumpians.

90
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,640
Yeah. That's not even that far fetched, is it? Some of the stuff he does. Yeah. Well,

91
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,700
it remains to be seen exactly where it's going to go, but I was quite skeptical in the past.

92
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,760
I've called it a Ponzi scheme. I'm not saying it's definitely not a Ponzi scheme, but I

93
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,400
think that its value is going to grow and seeing a hundred thousand dollars within a

94
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,560
year or two, I don't think he's out of the question.

95
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,440
I think when you wrap your head around the value that the blockchain brings, in short,

96
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,680
it's two parties that don't trust each other can use the blockchain to have a verified

97
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,600
transaction. That has applications across industry from individual to individual. It

98
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:20,760
could be huge. And once big business fully wraps its head around that, IBM, the Linux

99
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:27,720
Foundation, banks, they're all working on that right now. And that could be the subtext

100
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:33,100
to why Bitcoin has so much value is the fundamental technology it's based on. Big business is

101
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:38,080
trying to build a new product here. And speaking of big business, there's some big business

102
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
news too.

103
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:44,880
Yeah. So Red Hat, Facebook, Google, and IBM have all got together to announce the Common

104
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:51,240
Cure Rights Commitment, which is very, very similar to what we heard from the Linux kernel

105
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,920
contributors and copyright holders. And their assertion that they will, instead of suing

106
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,680
people who violate the GPL v2, they'll do their best to bring them into compliance and

107
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,960
actually release the code and go down that route rather than the litigious one.

108
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,600
Anybody making the code will tell you that suing companies fails all the time. They just

109
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,960
go into a defensive posture. They shut down their contributions to open source. And they

110
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,080
say, oh, lesson learned. We're not doing that again. Oh, that was a mistake. But when you

111
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:26,340
work with them and you inspire a culture within to contribute to open source, not because

112
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:32,240
they legally have to, but because it is beneficial for their development cycle and their company

113
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,480
and their end product, you actually get a full-fledged participant in open source, which

114
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,200
is really what we want. That's what these signing statements are about at the core of

115
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
them.

116
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,920
What Red Hat has done here is they've created something that just about any company could

117
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,160
take and apply it to their own GPL code. It's sort of this perfect little pre-made template

118
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,680
that lets you put in your own company name and your own couple of disclosures. You take

119
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,480
it off the blog, and boom, you now have your own signing statement. And that's exactly

120
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,360
what Facebook and IBM and Google have done. If you go to their blogs right now, they've

121
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,200
taken the text that Red Hat Legal has created, and they've just adapted it for their companies,

122
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,200
and added a few definitions. Like in the case of Google, they define a couple of the terms.

123
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,400
One of those is they do say, we're going to warn you. We're going to tell you you're screwing

124
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,160
up and that there may be legal action in the future. That doesn't mean we're suing you.

125
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,560
That just lets you know that we're beginning the process, and there does need to be a corrective

126
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,840
action. And they define how that's going to look and give these companies predictability.

127
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,960
So businesses and enterprises that are incorporating open source software have predictability,

128
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,840
and that's what companies are looking for.

129
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,680
This is very much the corporate side of all this, isn't it? It's all open source, never

130
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,200
a mention of free software in any of this.

131
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,420
Yeah, but this is all of the legalese that is necessary to get more Linux and more open

132
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,040
source shipping in products, in consumer products.

133
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,200
Yeah, definitely. It's something that I think has been long overdue, really, because a lot

134
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,980
of companies have been a bit reluctant because they are worried about getting sued because

135
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,920
there have been some very litigious people within the force world. And now we've got

136
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,880
a situation where a lot of the big companies and the big hitters are getting together and

137
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,120
saying, look, we're not interested in suing. We're interested in compliance. And that to

138
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,760
me is how it should be.

139
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,200
I'd like to know from the audience. They can give us some feedback, linuxactionnews.com

140
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,760
slash contact or tweet us at linuxactionnews or YouTube comment. Does this take some of

141
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:40,880
the wind out of the BSD and Apache licenses? Obviously, just some of the wind. There's

142
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,300
still lots of legitimate reasons to use those licenses. But now as a corporation with these

143
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,080
signing statements coming along, is there less risk?

144
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,920
Well, speaking of the kernel, there's been some clarification recently with regards the

145
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,560
LTS kernel. And we got it wrong, didn't we? We, along with a lot of other news sites and

146
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,840
commentators in the Linux world, had incorrectly assumed that the 4.14 LTS kernel was going

147
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:12,440
to be supported for six years. And now we know that is not the case.

148
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,560
Yeah, we thought the LTS development cycle was shifting to six years for all kernel releases

149
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,600
that were deemed LTS. Not true. They're going to be two years. So kernel 4.14 as of right

150
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,480
now is going to be supported for two years. And that's kind of confusing. What it means

151
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,100
is GregKH is responsible for LTS kernels, some of which get six years, some of which

152
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,940
get two years. And you'd be forgiven for not necessarily knowing where the deciding line

153
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:46,880
is because that's in Mountain View at Google's headquarters. They decide which kernels are

154
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,520
going to get the six year LTS. And then we just do two years as a community or Greg does

155
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,440
default beyond that. That appears to be my take from the outside is that essentially

156
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,360
Google or some company that probably ships a lot of Linux kernels is going to come to

157
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,600
the maintainers and say, please, please make this one an LTS kernel for six years. We're

158
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,880
going to have lots of hardware OEMs and system-on-a-chip manufacturers targeting this. Please, please

159
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,600
make this one a six year. And then Greg on his empire of Linux kernels will go, yes,

160
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,940
I have decided that that kernel shall too be six years. And then there'll be an announcement

161
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:26,560
about it. But by default, all other LTS kernels, two years.

162
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,000
Well, while it is our fault for getting this wrong, you do have to wonder, could it have

163
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,040
been communicated a little bit more clearly from the kernel team?

164
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,920
Yeah, I think people have been mistaking this since the announcement of Project Treble

165
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,200
for Android. That's kind of where this began to work its way in. Either way, you're right.

166
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,040
It's our bad. And we always try to follow up when we learn a correction. We'll always

167
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,760
try to include it in the show or put a link in the show notes.

168
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,880
DigitalOcean.com. Go create an account and then use our promo code. Here's the thing.

169
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,360
It's a way to create infrastructure on demand using the Linux distribution that you choose.

170
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,200
Ubuntu, Fedora, whatever you like. I'm not going to judge. And you can get started in

171
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,200
less than 55 seconds. Everything you deploy, if it's the low end, like two cents an hour

172
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:18,480
rig, up to the big ones with hundreds of gigs of RAM is going to have SSD storage. And then

173
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,940
you can add and upgrade as you need. You can deploy entire application stacks, say Nextcloud,

174
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,000
the entire thing or just the base operating system and build it yourself, however you

175
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,360
like to do it.

176
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,160
Very straightforward pricing, very fast networking, 40 gigabits into the hypervisors. Of course,

177
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:42,120
those hypervisors run Linux, KVM for the virtualizers, and then an amazing dashboard, a dashboard

178
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,360
for days. Whether you're an expert or rather, if you're just a beginner, you're going to

179
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,000
love the dashboard. It works really great. And then when you're ready to automate things,

180
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,560
they have an API that's simple, intuitive, and easy to understand with lots of open source

181
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,160
code already written to take advantage of it. And while you're there, go to digitalocean.com,

182
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,400
create your account, use a promo code, here's the thing, and then go to the community section.

183
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,320
You know that Docker thing, right? How do you actually get that installed and configure

184
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,900
it? They got a guide. digitalocean.com, create your account, promo code, here's the thing,

185
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:18,880
and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Action News.

186
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,960
So Chris, I know you've had a lot of problems with GNOME, and you've had a lot of distro

187
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,600
hopping in the studio lately. Well, hop no more, sir. Have I got the distro for you,

188
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,080
and that is the Raspberry Pi desktop based on Debian Stretch, Raspbian.

189
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,240
Really? Now I can run it on my x86, eh?

190
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,520
Yeah, exactly. PCs and Macs.

191
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,880
Yeah, that's just so exciting. In fact, they actually specifically mentioned Macs. They

192
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,440
say, today we're launching the first Debian Stretch release of the Raspberry Pi desktop

193
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,800
for PCs and Macs, and we're also releasing the latest version of Raspbian Stretch for

194
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,800
your Pi.

195
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,580
Yeah, so have you tried this out on x86 hardware?

196
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:03,440
You know, I was almost going to, and then I read that they're using the LXDE desktop

197
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,360
still in 2017, and to be honest with you, Joe, I thought, I like some of the modifications

198
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,480
they're making, but it's obviously not designed for me, and I didn't want to come away with

199
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,840
a bad taste in my mouth.

200
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:20,760
Well, I downloaded it, and I installed it, but then it wouldn't boot. So that kind of

201
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:27,200
sucked. But then I booted it again and went into the live session, and that worked perfectly.

202
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,160
So I don't know quite what was going on there, and my touchpad didn't work in the graphical

203
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:38,040
installer, so I don't know. But anyway, let's gloss over those bad points. And if you want

204
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:44,400
to have an experience on a laptop or desktop computer that is identical to that of a Pi

205
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:51,240
using the official Raspbian distro, then look no further. And this doesn't make sense to

206
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,880
almost anyone listening to our show, I don't think, because as you say, it's using this

207
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,960
old LXDE desktop. Wayland is not even something they're thinking about. They're looking for

208
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:07,640
just pure stability, something that works and has been working for a long time. And

209
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:15,260
so where this is aimed is educators, teachers, parents, Raspberry Pi enthusiasts who want

210
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:21,320
to have feature parity between their Pi and a desktop or laptop computer. And if you look

211
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,640
at it from that angle, it suddenly makes a lot of sense.

212
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,400
Yeah, I suppose, in an ideal world. So let's back up a little bit. So it is a little different.

213
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,860
The x86 version is a bit different than the Raspberry Pi version in that it lacks Mathematica,

214
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:43,620
but it includes two applications that the ARM version does not have, and I think give

215
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:50,520
you an indication of where they're going. Number one is Pi Server. This allows you to

216
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:57,000
set up an operating system, such as Raspbian, on the PC, which can then be shared by a number

217
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,260
of Pi clients networked to it. It's intended to make it easy for classrooms to have multiple

218
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,240
Pi's all running exactly the same software, and for the teacher to have control over how

219
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,200
the software is installed and used.

220
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,280
Yeah, you can imagine this as all the Pi's plugged into a switch, all on the same network,

221
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,560
all the Pi's are set to boot from the network, and then you can just manage it all from one

222
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,960
central location, rather than having to mess around with SD cards and cloning them and

223
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:30,600
DDing or whatever. That makes a lot of sense to me, and to have it as an application, okay,

224
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,160
maybe that should just be a standalone application that you can run on Windows or Linux, but

225
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,160
well, this is a start. At least you can boot into this Raspberry Pi desktop, which they've

226
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,400
dropped the pixel branding. I think we've talked about that in the past. Let's just

227
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,520
gloss over that one. They learned from that mistake. But it seems to me that for its niche,

228
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,960
this makes a lot of sense.

229
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,760
Maybe. So the other second application they've added is, which is a great idea, I think,

230
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:00,220
an application which allows you on the x86 version to easily use the GPIO pins of a Raspberry

231
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:06,880
Pi Zero connected via USB to a PC in an application using Stretcher Python. These things make

232
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,920
sense. I want to back up though for a moment and tell you where I think perhaps I smell

233
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,880
some missteps.

234
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,080
So first, I feel like they're not being completely genuine with the audience. Now I'm not a big

235
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,600
Raspberry Pi insider. I don't really follow it super closely. But when I read this, it

236
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,120
reads smarmy to me, and that comes across as deception. So I'll read the paragraph for

237
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,120
you.

238
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,120
When we released our custom desktop environment on Debian for PCs and Macs last year, we were

239
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,320
slightly taken aback by how popular it turned out to be. We really only created it as a

240
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,280
result of one of these wouldn't-it-be-cool-if conversations we sometimes have in the office.

241
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:56,440
So we were delighted by the Pi community's reaction. Seeing how keen people were on the

242
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,520
x86 version, we've decided that we're going to try to keep releasing it alongside Raspbian,

243
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,980
the ultimate aim to make simultaneous releases of both.

244
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:10,780
Now the reason I don't like this is because it reads like this. We just happen to make

245
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,980
an x86 version. And then it just happened to be popular. And so we just happened to

246
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:23,220
spend hundreds of hours of time creating the Pi server to enable a total thin client environment

247
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,500
around the Raspberry Pi. We just happened to create a software middle layer that will

248
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,080
map GPIO pins on a USB-attached Raspberry Pi Zero to a Python application you're developing

249
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,120
on a Linux desktop. Oops! Just happened to do that.

250
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,280
And so here it is, everybody. And now we're going to alter our entire development scope

251
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:46,520
to match these two releases up and synchronize their releases. That just happened. It just

252
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:52,960
happened. And that reads as disingenuous to me. I don't disagree with them releasing on

253
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,840
x86 and completing a product and making a development environment where you can use

254
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,400
a larger powerful PC for applications that you might run on a Pi. That seems like a great

255
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,000
idea too. But their messaging comes across as disingenuous. This feels like a part of

256
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,320
a larger plan, a bigger strategy, but they don't know how to message it to the open source

257
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,520
community. Just like they didn't know how to message the Pixel desktop, they're not

258
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,040
messaging this correctly. And if you look at their approach around using LXDE, that's

259
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:26,060
the second red flag. Now, no disrespect to LXDE. I love me a lightweight efficient Linux

260
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:31,400
desktop that works for your workflow. That's awesome. But when asked about it, Simon Long

261
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,160
says we've invested a lot of time and effort into LXDE-based solutions and see no reason

262
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,760
to change. It works well for what we require. So then a commenter named Mike says, well,

263
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:46,840
what about Wayland and Weston? LXDE seems to be dead, like a dead end to me. Simon replies,

264
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,440
Simon again involved in all of this replies, LXDE is a mature working stable desktop environment,

265
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,840
which does everything we need it to. This notion of dead ends is not one into which

266
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,760
I subscribe to. As if software being end of life is a theory that one can subscribe to

267
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,700
or not. So that's red flag number one. And then the second part is, we investigated Wayland

268
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,160
seven years ago and decided it didn't go with anything we needed and was too bleeding edge

269
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:18,740
to move to. They go on to say, we'll go on for a while because LXDE does everything we

270
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:24,440
need, essentially, and don't anticipate that changing anytime soon. We'll stick with that

271
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,400
desktop environment that we spent over three years tweaking, debugging, improving. Newer

272
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,240
is not the same as better, certainly not in the world of software. But see, this betrays

273
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,160
a fundamental huge misunderstanding about open source software. Because what people

274
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,160
are really saying when they're asking about the future of LXDE is they're saying, well,

275
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,800
what are you going to do? Are you going to maintain LXDE on X all on your own? Are you

276
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,440
going to maintain Xorg and LXDE one day all on your own? Are you going to run a Raspbian

277
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,760
fork of that desktop when the rest of the open source community is developing other

278
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:02,120
solutions and moving towards Wayland? Are you going to go at your own just like you're

279
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,440
going at your own on these other projects? It doesn't make sense. And it betrays a fundamental

280
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,680
misunderstanding of the open source community and what they're even asking for.

281
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,760
But hang on, it's all working fine right now. So therefore, it's going to work forever,

282
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
right?

283
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,360
Right. But when you're built, that's great for an end user, right? That's great. Great.

284
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,800
That is super great for an end user, and that's how it should be. When you're a platform developer,

285
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,240
when you're creating a platform for educators, for things that are going to schools for years,

286
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,720
for things that students to learn upon, you have to think more than two years down the

287
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,320
road. And you have to think about your resources and the people available to develop projects

288
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:43,100
and how much you want to take on as a company yourself or as a foundation. How much in-house

289
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:47,160
development do you want to do? How many software projects do you want?

290
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,200
Now you've got an ARM distro and an x86 distro, both of which are now diverging from each

291
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,380
other. How much further do you want to go down that path?

292
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,920
But going back to your other point about education and creating an environment that's on the

293
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:04,000
Pi and the desktop that are similar, I do kind of, I grok that. That makes sense to

294
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,360
me. I'm doubtful that large IT organizations in these school districts are going to standardize

295
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,240
on the Raspbian desktop, but I could see it in a few areas. I could see it in some workshops.

296
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,480
I could see it in projects at home. And so it does make some sense to me. But there are

297
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,240
those red flags there that I can't ignore.

298
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,280
Yeah, well, you talk about workshops and stuff. They recently released that Makerspace magazine.

299
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:30,920
So it kind of fits in with those smaller organizations, doesn't it?

300
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:36,240
Yeah. And in that context, I can see it making sense. I hope that they understand that there

301
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,680
is a certain point in which you need to just sort of go with the flow of open source. Canonical

302
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,280
recently learned that lesson with Unity, and now they're working upstream with Gnome. That

303
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,560
ticket will eventually come due for Raspbian too.

304
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:55,080
Yeah. Well, we'll have to see. Well, let's talk about Mozilla. Now, you are a big fan,

305
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:01,080
Chris, of voice assistants. You use your Amazon thing quite a lot to control things. And I've

306
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,360
been skeptical of it. I have no interest in having a box listening to me all the time.

307
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:12,200
But it seems that I'm a bit weird in that sense, because this is taking off massively.

308
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:19,280
But the problem is the Alexa thing, Apple's one, Google's one, they're all proprietary

309
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:25,520
and using a proprietary backend. Mozilla have decided to step up and see that this is part

310
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,920
of the future, at least, if not the future. And now they've released their open source

311
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:36,440
speech recognition model, which is pretty accurate. It seems that Mozilla are not being

312
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,960
left behind on this. They're not doing a Firefox OS and waiting for the competitors to get

313
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,320
way advanced. Maybe they're a little bit behind, but I think that they're far less behind than

314
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,360
they were before. And it's good to see this, even though it's something I don't have a

315
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,920
massive interest in. I think that it's good that we have Mozilla and who better than Mozilla

316
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,640
to pioneer this space in an open source way.

317
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,600
Yeah. So for full context here, speech recognition, the backend, real compute aspect to it, and

318
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,120
all of the data is really locked down to like two, maybe three companies if you want to

319
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:16,520
be generous. And so if you're working on a Mycroft project or even building a point of

320
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,600
sale kiosk where you want to have voice recognition, you got to work with one of these companies

321
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:27,240
and their incredible prices and their entire closed nature to have any success at all.

322
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,760
So we've talked about project common voice in the past. This is the voice and speech

323
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,400
data aspect of what Mozilla is working on. And today they're talking about project deep

324
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:44,580
speech. Now project deep speech is the compute and algorithms that actually analyze the data.

325
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,640
This is all open source stuff that the Mozilla Foundation is working on. And they're claiming

326
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:55,000
that their speech to text engine has an error rate of just 6%. Essentially on a clean data

327
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,280
set, it has the error rate of a human in understanding. And they're making this available to anyone,

328
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,000
including all of the data. You can go download all 12 gigs of it right now.

329
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,080
And this is the sort of thing that we want to see Mozilla doing, isn't it?

330
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,160
Yeah. This is a considerable amount of data that they're contributing. I mean, it's just

331
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,240
huge really. It's hard to even state it. And they're just getting started. They're working

332
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,920
with English right now. And this is from their article, their blog post. They say they're

333
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,680
working hard to ensure that common voice will support voice donations in multiple languages

334
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,720
beginning in the first half of 2018.

335
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,800
Yeah. It's kind of a shame that this didn't happen a year or two ago for Mycroft's sake,

336
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:36,000
because maybe they'd be a lot further along had it happened then.

337
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,560
So you might be wondering, how does Mozilla afford to do all of this? Well, actually we

338
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,200
have a little bit of insights into that. You can read the full article at linuxactionnews.com.

339
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,520
slash 30, but they've posted their annual report for 2016. And there's a brief here

340
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,600
that I want to read because I think it'll help everybody understand how Mozilla works

341
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
a little better.

342
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,740
Mozilla is not your average organization. It was founded as a community open source

343
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:07,520
project in 1998. Mozilla is structured as two organizations. The 501c3 Mozilla Foundation,

344
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,320
which backs emerging leaders and mobilizes citizens to create global movement for the

345
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:17,360
health of the internet. That's how I like that. And then their wholly owned subsidiary,

346
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,680
the Mozilla Corporation, which creates products and explores new technologies that gives people

347
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:28,000
more control over their lives and basically makes the Firefox and Thunderbird product,

348
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I believe.

349
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,920
So you have two organizations, sort of the aspirational foundation and the corporation,

350
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:38,280
which is making the products. And together, they're actually making pretty good money.

351
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:44,280
Even though we've talked a lot about how Chrome and WebKit in general are dominating the web,

352
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
Mozilla's had a good year.

353
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Yeah, thanks, Marissa.

354
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,920
Yeah, really. There's some deals that they had in place. I mean, the big part of their

355
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,520
revenue undoubtedly comes from search. Going back to Google and integrating their search

356
00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:02,880
partnerships, they earn the bulk of their revenue there. In 2015, they earned 414 million

357
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,560
from their search deals. And in 2016, they've earned 506 million. They've localized a little

358
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,080
more. So it's not just Google across the board. In different regions, they're going with more

359
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,680
regional specific search engines. And here in the States, it's back to Google.

360
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:22,600
Well, I can't wait to see this time next year when we get the 2017 numbers and see quite

361
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:28,960
how much of that Yahoo money plus the new Google money is working out because it's got

362
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,040
to be more than this, I would have thought, because they're getting paid twice now for

363
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,040
search.

364
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,640
You know, you often talk about how they spend their money. I think you probably like this.

365
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,600
So the foundation, which is the more aspirational stuff, has about 80 employees and then about

366
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:48,360
a thousand or more volunteers around the world. 80 employees for the foundation. But the corporation,

367
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,160
the one making the products that you and I talk about all the time, a thousand employees

368
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,520
worldwide. A thousand. That's a much bigger investment.

369
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,720
The foundation does seem to be more volunteer driven. So some of these things that come

370
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,320
out, some of these initiatives that you hear about from Mozilla, because both of these,

371
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,480
the corporation and the foundation, they operate together as Mozilla. So sometimes what you're

372
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:14,720
hearing about is just from a group of 80 people plus a bunch of volunteers. But the code that

373
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,920
we all use every day is where the real employment and staffing investment is.

374
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,600
Kind of reminds me of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. They have a similar setup that they've got

375
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:29,280
two very distinct entities. Raspberry Pi Trading, which is what sells all of the pies and makes

376
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,600
all the money. And then the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which is what spends all the money on the

377
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,960
various education and outreach stuff and the magazines and everything.

378
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,380
You know, I'll just wrap it up with this. My personal thoughts are Firefox is stronger

379
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:46,480
than ever. 57 really did win me over. With the exception of just a couple of machines

380
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,280
here in the studio, all of my machines and my machine at home are now running Firefox.

381
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:55,520
And it does honestly feel faster and like it puts less load on my Linux box than Chrome

382
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,160
does. And that's all it took for me.

383
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,360
Well, I'm still using it. I haven't made the switch just yet. And I also have not made

384
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:09,920
the switch to Sailfish OS, despite Yola's attempts to popularize it. And they've posted

385
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:15,280
an update talking about Sailfish X, which is on the Xperia X and how that seems to be

386
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:20,160
going well for them. And also they seem to be jumping on the blockchain bandwagon.

387
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:25,320
Yeah. So this is the six week checkup. Can you believe it has been six weeks since we

388
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,440
talked about Sailfish X and all of that? And they say it's going well, Joe. And they're

389
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,900
expanding the program. They're going to focus on new Sony Xperia hardware in 2018. And they're

390
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,800
going all in, like you said, on blockchain. They're working with a company called Zipper

391
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:46,600
Global Limited, which is a blockchain specialized company. They work with Ethereum products.

392
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,920
Here's your translation. And they're going to develop the world's first blockchain solutions

393
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:56,800
on top of an open mobile operating system. These all sound like really big goals, like

394
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:00,760
big things. And they back it up. They say the program is going to be utilizing Sailfish

395
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:06,600
X as a development platform and targets to offer the world's best open source development

396
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,800
environment for the rapidly expanding developer community of blockchain application developers.

397
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,200
That's a lot of buzzwords and blockchain and developers, Joe. It's like a soup right there.

398
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,180
Well, yeah, it used to be that you'd go into a VC meeting, mentioned VR, and they'd just

399
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:27,120
throw money at you. Now the key word is blockchain and they throw money at you. And that's what

400
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,600
this feels like. I can't see anything concrete at all here. I can see a lot of buzzwords

401
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,720
and a lot of what looks like vaporware, but I just don't really see anything concrete

402
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,680
and any details on how this is actually going to work. Did I miss something here?

403
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,720
I tend to agree. I think there's a couple of ideas in here that if you had a company

404
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:51,160
that had some real scale and some real user base might actually gain traction. And it

405
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:56,520
seems easy enough. You just create your own crypto coin. The platform will have its own

406
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:02,440
currency. It's called Zip and it's going to fuel the community and platform development.

407
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,600
They're going to have like an incentive for the users, too. So it's not just going to

408
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:13,120
be for developers. And as you create applications or give feedback or submit bug fixes, you

409
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,800
could get Zip currency. And then maybe this Zip currency could be converted into something

410
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:26,680
that actually matters. I don't know. But that idea might actually have something to it.

411
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:31,720
If you're a large, say you're a Samsung, say you're a Google, if you're a large open source

412
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,740
project and you could just go fork Litecoin and call it JoeCoin, and then all of a sudden

413
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:41,080
everybody who's contributing to Project Joe gets a little bit of JoeCoin, you just need

414
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:45,160
one exchange to convert that to Bitcoin and well, Bob's your uncle. You now got yourself

415
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
a cryptocurrency.

416
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,440
Yeah, I suppose. It just feels like an ICO, an initial coin offering to me.

417
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,760
Yeah, it's a way to generate hype and value on a platform that otherwise wouldn't have

418
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
it.

419
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,400
Yeah. Just think that this week, especially with Bitcoin, as we said at the top of the

420
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,640
show, topping 10,000, it just seems an awfully convenient time to announce this, doesn't

421
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,640
it?

422
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,640
Yeah. I mean, it is our job to be skeptical and look at these things from an objective

423
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,240
position. But if something interesting develops here or another open source project takes

424
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:18,760
this idea and runs with it, we might just be the very first place to tell you about

425
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,680
