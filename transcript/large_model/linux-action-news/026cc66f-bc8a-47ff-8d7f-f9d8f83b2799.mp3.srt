00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,080
Welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on the free and open source world. This is

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,960
episode one, recorded May 14th, 2017. I'm Chris.

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,960
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,520
Hey Joe, happy Mother's Day.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,360
Oh yeah, it's Mother's Day in America, not in England though.

6
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,320
No, but I just felt like I should just wish you a happy Mother's Day for our first episode.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,320
Fair enough.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,080
We have so many interesting stories this week, we couldn't have picked a better week to start.

9
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,160
And I think maybe what might be one of our largest stories for a while is what's happening

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,660
at Canonical. And this week, Mark Shuttleworth, in an interview at OpenStack Summit, talked

11
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:50,680
about Canonical's path to an IPO. And this could be a massive shift for Canonical, Joe.

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,080
Well, this already is that we've seen it over the last few weeks, haven't we? And as you

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,200
say, this is the perfect time to start the show because this is, I would say, probably

14
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,440
the biggest story in Linux for five years, maybe longer than that.

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:08,440
You know, Joe, I think people don't realize how big of a story this is yet because things

16
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,240
are still transitioning. There's some things that are still happening that haven't fully

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,600
clicked into place yet. And it's going to be a massive shift for this company, a massive

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,160
shift for the Linux desktop. And if Canonical goes for the IPO, that means a big shift in

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,920
what the company focuses on. It's going to be less altruistic type things and more does

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,560
this make a profit type things.

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,360
Well, yeah, this whole idea that they were this family, it wasn't a proper company, was

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,120
it? It was this kind of super happy fun time FOSS family that was, you know, made a few

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,720
pounds here and there, but wasn't too bothered about it and was interested in software freedom.

24
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,320
Whereas now, it seems like Shuttleworth has just realized that he's not going to make

25
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,280
money from the desktop. The desktop is not going to be a success financially. And he's

26
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,640
just decided to cash out by the sounds of things.

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,360
I don't I don't know if I don't know if that's true. I actually would I would actually disagree

28
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,420
with you just to a bit. I think it's ironically the desktops probably making Canonical more

29
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,840
revenue right now than it ever has. Based on my conversations with Mr. Barton George

30
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,360
at Dell, they're seeing 100% year over year growth on those desktops. And to the point

31
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:22,840
where in India and China, half the machines sold are running Ubuntu. It's and here's

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,000
the thing, Joe, I don't know any of the details. But according to Barton, every single one

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,480
of those machines has a support contract paid by Dell to Canonical.

34
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,040
Right. So there is revenue coming in there. So therefore, you have to ask yourself, why

35
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,920
are they abandoning Unity? Okay, you can see why they abandoned Unity 8 and convergence

36
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,100
because that wasn't making them any money. But Unity 7 on the desktop is making the money.

37
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,040
So why are they making the shift to GNOME?

38
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,720
I think it's pretty clear that there was a realization at the upper levels of Canonical

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,040
that they weren't going to change anyone's mind. I think that's an exasperation we're

40
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,840
seeing. It's an exasperation. All right, you know what we're going to do, we're just going

41
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,000
to disengage and just make let this make money. In fact, Joe, in some ways, it's it's parallel

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,960
to what Apple is doing with the Macs. They're just sitting there in milking an existing

43
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:17,100
market while they focus on the things that make money, iOS, iPhone, services, things

44
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,600
like that. Canonical is going to do the same thing. They're going to ship a desktop, and

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,800
they may even invest some time and engineering into it. But it's not going to be their own

46
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,180
whole creation like it was in the past. Instead, they're going to spend their time innovating

47
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,960
on things like snap packages, things that they can do to be more competitive in open

48
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,560
stack space, things that they can do to be more competitive in containers in the cloud,

49
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,760
they're going to double down on LXD, those areas where they're making money, IoT, that's

50
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,180
going to be what they focus on. And they're just going to sit here and bring revenue in

51
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,800
from the desktop, and they're going to ship a no just a vanilla gnome desktop. That's my

52
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,960
cynical view of it.

53
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,120
Well, yeah, basically, they're abandoning the desktop to the community. Meanwhile, they're

54
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,920
going to still make some revenue off it by the sounds of things. And why bother to spend

55
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,280
valuable resources on an engineering team for the desktop when Ubuntu gnome is doing

56
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,040
it for free for you when you can just co-opt them? That mean you talked about being cynical.

57
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,640
I mean, how is that for cynical?

58
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,800
Oh, geez. Yeah. Although, did you see that before all of this big news about dropping

59
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,800
unity and switching to gnome came down? Did you see that? I think it was Dustin Kirkland.

60
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,360
I might be wrong on the attribution, but I'm pretty sure it was Dustin that went on Hacker

61
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,680
News and started a thread asking the always interactive folks over at hackernews.com what

62
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,400
they wanted from the Ubuntu desktop. And on the top of the list is just ship us a standard

63
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,120
gnome desktop. Did you see that?

64
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,920
Yeah, that was interesting timing, wasn't it? That they basically just said ship Gnome

65
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,520
and Wayland. And that's exactly what canonical turnaround and did well announced they were

66
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,920
going to do about a week later.

67
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,960
It's almost like they were putting feelers out there to see how people would react.

68
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,280
They surely must have made the decision before that.

69
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,480
I completely agree. But I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't just a let's double check the

70
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,640
temperature of the market before we make this announcement.

71
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,800
Yeah, yeah, maybe they were checking that people weren't saying, oh, we want unity eight

72
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,680
finish unity eight, get it out the door. Whereas it seems that at least with, okay, it's a

73
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:23,840
very specific part of the desktop users Hacker News, at least they want just standard gnome.

74
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,480
And well, that's what they're going to get.

75
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,100
Well, Joe, can I float another idea past you too? So when we look at that Hacker News discussion

76
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,200
thread, which got a ton of traction, and we look at who's buying Dell Sputnik laptops,

77
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,400
and we look at who's buying Galago Pros, I think a large selection of them are that quote

78
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,120
unquote, web developer, that developer who wants to run on their laptop the same environment

79
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,720
they run in production. And that's why bash on Windows doesn't work for them, because

80
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,400
it needs to be exactly what they run in production. It really does make a difference. It really

81
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,600
makes a difference for these people. And so for them, they're buying up these Sputnik

82
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,200
laptops like crazy. And they're buying they're looking at system, system 76 machines and

83
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:06,160
entryware machines with an entirely new set of interests now. And you have to wonder if

84
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,680
these if these manufacturers aren't coming to canonical and saying, I need to plan the

85
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,680
next year of products. And this Unity eight stuff you haven't you haven't shipped anything

86
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,560
mirror hasn't shipped. I mean, it's shipped, but it's just been in testing, like Unity

87
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,480
eight isn't ready yet. We need to plan our products we have, we have to plan things out

88
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:32,160
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 18 months in advance. And right now, we're seeing demand for the gnome

89
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,720
desktop. The fedora distribution can deliver that open Sousa can deliver that canonical,

90
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,320
we want to work with you. But we're kind of we're a little hesitant about your path in

91
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,320
your future. What do you have for us? Because the reason why I say that Joe is I saw a lot

92
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,200
of machines at Dell running the gnome desktop, they weren't necessarily running Unity seven,

93
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,680
it seems to be that there is a lot of momentum there. And so you think that that's why they

94
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,960
have decided to finally kill unity then because they they've got this pressure from the OEM

95
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,640
saying to them, people don't like unity, they want just standard stuff like gnome that you

96
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,840
can get on all the other distros. Because one thing about Unity seven was, it wasn't

97
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,160
very portable, was it? You kind of could run it on arch if you really wanted to, but you

98
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,880
couldn't run it on any of the other distros. Whereas now, if you look at what's probably

99
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,720
going to be stock Ubuntu and stock fedora, and the grown version of open Sousa, you've

100
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,760
got a unified experience across those.

101
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,320
Yeah, and I think a really inconvenient thing happened along the way to mobile is the desktop

102
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,240
actually started getting some traction. Inconveniently, while canonical was focusing on building

103
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,160
a great mobile experience, the desktop actually started making the company a significant amount

104
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,720
of money. And so recently, what from what I can tell, it seems like they got really

105
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,080
serious about unity eight on the desktop, but it was just too little too late. The the

106
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,260
vendors, I believe, want something today. The the Linux end users that are developing

107
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,280
on Linux and deploying in the cloud, they want something today. And we're not we're

108
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,160
not really ready to wait around. In the meantime, it's not like MacBooks. And it's not like

109
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,080
Windows 10 is sitting around both of them are getting better. And they're adding features

110
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,800
that are more appealing to this to this particular developer market.

111
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, you say that the desktop was starting to gain traction there. Could that be because

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,760
unity seven was mature, it was stable, it was working fine. And okay, I've never been

113
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:29,000
a fan of it. But I speak to people who are and they say, okay, early on, it was a bit

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,160
ropey, didn't work too well. Whereas towards the end now, in well, people who are using

115
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,120
1604 are happily using it. It's very, very stable. I mean, I saw poppy saying that gnome

116
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,880
shell is crashing on him. And it used to unity would crash maybe once a month, whereas he's

117
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,680
had like two or three crashes a day with gnome.

118
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,040
It's funny. It's gnome three has just started crashing on me on our OBS machine that we

119
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,160
have here in the studio in the last couple of days. I don't know why. But all of a sudden,

120
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,320
every few hours, it just reloads.

121
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,160
Why the hell would you use gnome on such critical infrastructure as the OBS machine surely should

122
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,360
be using XFC or LXD. So it's, you know, all the resources.

123
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,040
Well, because unlike you, I try to skate to where the pucks gonna be. So that way I have

124
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,000
very informed commentary right here on the show. So I live and breathe the gnome three

125
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,760
desktop because let's be honest, that's where that that's where everybody's going. And I

126
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,720
don't stay on XFC island like you do, Joe. I don't like XFC. I want the real desktop.

127
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,200
I want the current desktop. I want when I say people should try Linux, I want the experience

128
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,480
that they're going to get Joe.

129
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,680
Well, yeah, that's why you can maybe use that on your laptop. But on critical infrastructure,

130
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,780
man, I would not be using something as heavy as gnome.

131
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,360
To tell you the truth, Joe, I can't really argue with you right now, because you're right.

132
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,160
But I think it's sort of a deep irony, if you're also right about why, why maybe it's

133
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,280
just getting successful right now is because of unity seven, I disagree with that premise.

134
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,880
I don't think it's unity seven that's making the Linux desktop take off right now for these

135
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,680
particular web dev type customer base, or whatever. I don't mean to categorize it as

136
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,040
just web devs. But you have to understand that I've been talking to these companies,

137
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,040
and that's who they're focusing at. And that's where they're actually seeing a lot of sales.

138
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,040
And you know what they're doing, Joe, they're using the command line, they don't care what

139
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,320
the UI is, they don't care if it's unity, they don't care if it's gnome, as long as

140
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,760
they get a terminal, as long as they get Docker, as long as they get git and all of the same

141
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,560
tools, they're happy. And it sort of doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how much time and

142
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,560
effort canonical puts into unity eight, it doesn't matter if they keep unity seven going

143
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,000
for the next 15 years. And it doesn't really matter if they just ship stock, no, because

144
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,400
the reality is, everybody's just using the terminal, everybody's just using sublime text

145
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:42,720
or atom or Visual Studio code or them. And it doesn't matter. And imagine if you could

146
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,680
have all that stuff and your games as well. All the triple a title games on the same operating

147
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,480
system. Oh, that would be super tempting. In fact, that would be so tempting. If there

148
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,160
was something like that out there, Joe, I may never switch to another operating system.

149
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,760
Hmm, yeah. I wonder if Microsoft maybe have thought of that. Hey, yeah, this was some

150
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,000
big news from build conference this year. So last year, Microsoft announced the ability

151
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,520
to run the Ubuntu environment like a bath shell on Windows. Now this year at build 2017,

152
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:16,120
they have announced they're also bringing Sousa and Fedora. And along with that, they're

153
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,340
also putting Ubuntu Fedora and Sousa in the Windows Store. So it's just like an app you

154
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:25,360
install now from the Windows Store. And Bob's your uncle, you've got Linux right there on

155
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,640
your Windows box. This will be coming in the fall Creators Update. What do you think, Joe?

156
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,800
Well, I think what is key here is the fact that they're going to be in the Windows Store,

157
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,120
which means that it's going to be on Windows 10 S, which is the lockdown one they're trying

158
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:44,560
to sell to students because they realize that these students are going to need Linux. I

159
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,600
mean, Microsoft has long since accepted, Microsoft loves Linux and all that stuff. They've long

160
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:57,640
since accepted that in the cloud, Linux has won, but they don't want to lose the desktop

161
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,720
because that's basically what they're hanging on to. I mean, they've got Azure and everything,

162
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,680
but the desktop and Office and that's a big part of their business model. And so they

163
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,440
don't want to lose it. And this is their way of doing that. They're incorporating what

164
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,800
is effectively Linux, even though it's not Linux, is it? Because there's no Linux kernel,

165
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,240
it's everything, it's sort of all the GNU stuff and all that. And they just want to

166
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,760
keep people on Windows as much as possible. And you have to say it's a very smart play

167
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,240
by them.

168
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,800
Finally, finally, I can use proper NTFS with Linux, finally. I have to tell you, I have

169
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,200
to tell you if I was stuck on Windows, like say I worked at a company that required Windows

170
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,440
for some sort of network reason or for other reasons, I would be very thankful for this

171
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,360
feature. And I'm very impressed that Microsoft is willing to do this. It does sort of alarm

172
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,640
me a bit that it makes it less enticing to switch away. But I go back to, it truly makes

173
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,760
a difference that you run on your test and dev machine, which you run in production.

174
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,960
And so while it's cute and handy, and it makes Cygwin look like a product of the past, I

175
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,640
don't really fear this. I don't really fear this.

176
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
You hate it.

177
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:14,440
Yeah, I don't. I tell you why, Joe. The problem is Windows 10. It really is shit, Joe. And

178
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:19,200
I'm not just saying that because I like Linux. I recently tried it out again when I was testing

179
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,720
out different video editors, and I had it on a 4K display. It's a joke, Joe. It's a

180
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,000
real joke. It is laughable. When Apple ships a high DPI product, the entire operating system

181
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,380
and all of the applications are high DPI because they control it all. Okay, I grok that. When

182
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:40,100
Linux ships a high DPI product, some things that are GTK3 or QT5 look great in high DPI.

183
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,000
And I understand why some things that are maybe older like your XFCE desktop look like

184
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,960
total arse. But when Microsoft ships a high DPI desktop, their own stuff, like their own

185
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,640
management interface is mixed. They have multiple control panels. They have 10 different ways

186
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,380
to do things. They're bundling Cortana like it's going out of style. They have new ways

187
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:07,760
of invading your privacy. In fact, one of my favorite ones is you can turn off ad personalization,

188
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,240
but you cannot actually turn off ads in your start menu. And when you turn off ad personalization,

189
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,600
it warns you and it says, by the way, you will still see ads. They just won't be personalized.

190
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,040
That kind of stuff, Joe, the reason why I mentioned it is because it is the little things

191
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,480
that grate against people's nerves that does compel them to buy a machine running Linux

192
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,360
or to try installing Linux on their machine. And so while this stuff is great, and if I

193
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,620
was stuck in a Windows world, I absolutely would use this. And I'm impressed that Microsoft's

194
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:40,000
doing it. As a Linux user, I'm a little underwhelmed. First of all, is it SUSE? Is it open SUSE?

195
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,280
Is it version, is it LEAP? Is it, what is it? And which version of Fedora is it? Is

196
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,160
it Fedora 25? Is it Fedora 24? Is it Fedora Atomic? Is it Fedora Cloud based on version

197
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,760
24? There's no information here. And one other thing I'll just happen to say is the day that

198
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,680
Microsoft announced Ubuntu running on Windows, there were folks at Canonical that had the

199
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,820
entire blog post up on how all of it works, about how they packaged it up, about the testing

200
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,480
they did, about how the performance works. So as somebody who wanted to use this in production

201
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,280
potentially, I totally grokked how it worked, how it worked for me, and what the potential

202
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,560
limitations are. There has been nothing from SUSE or Fedora.

203
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,680
Why do you suppose that is then? Do they just not really care about it? If Microsoft said

204
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:28,180
to them, we want to use, you know, SUSE and we want to use Fedora with this Linux, Windows

205
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:33,240
subsystem for Linux, and they've just said, yeah, okay, whatever, use it. And just they

206
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,360
don't really give a shit about that.

207
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,620
To be honest, I can't tell because in one sense, it could be good. Maybe they've modified

208
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,800
the subsystem for Linux in such a way that any distro is possible, and so they just put

209
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,160
these distros on there. Or they did, they worked directly with these different distributions

210
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,480
and they're just choosing not to promote it because maybe some of them came out and shit

211
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,280
all over Canonical in the past when they announced this feature. I don't know if you recall that,

212
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,080
but there were folks that came out of the woodwork and shamed Canonical for doing this.

213
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,760
And now some of those same people helped enable it for their distribution.

214
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,380
Yeah, I mean, I would have thought that the licensing would mean that you'd have to kind

215
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:11,000
of do a deal, wouldn't you? I don't suppose they could just ship it in Windows.

216
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,280
The trademarking alone, right? You would think that the trademarking alone would be enough

217
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,320
that they'd have to work out some sort of deal. But they're saying SUSE, so maybe it's

218
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,020
SUSE Enterprise, which at that point, how many of you out there have SUSE Enterprise

219
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,560
on your VPS? Raise your hand. Oh, none of you. Oh, okay. Well, how many of you have

220
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,200
Fedora? Oh, okay. Yeah.

221
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,160
Fedora is available for digital ocean, isn't it? I'm sure some people are using it.

222
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,880
What do you think, though, of the joke I've seen passed around online now that it's truly

223
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,800
the year of the Linux desktop because you can now run Linux on Windows? Does that sting?

224
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,120
It's kind of true, isn't it? Yeah. You've got Chromebooks and these Windows S laptops

225
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,880
covering a Windows 10 S, which are both basically Chromebook type devices, both of them running,

226
00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:01,080
well, one actually Linux and one everything but Linux. And so it kind of is really the

227
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,720
year of Linux on a desktop, but just not as we thought it would be.

228
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,160
I would put it differently. I would say it's the year of the Linux runtime. It's the year

229
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,880
of the Linux runtime. And I think that's actually part of why our show is important because

230
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,560
Linux now runs everywhere. As a developer, you can write for Linux now and you can run

231
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,040
it on BSD. You can run it, of course, on Linux servers, which are the predominant web servers

232
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,520
on the web. You can run it now on Windows. You can run it in virtualization. You can

233
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,960
run it in Docker. It's truly the universal platform that doesn't have some crazy runtime

234
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
around it.

235
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,600
Yeah, I think that's fair to say.

236
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,200
It's kind of amazing. Welcome to 2017, everybody, where Microsoft is shipping Fedora, SUSE, and

237
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,280
Ubuntu in the Windows store, in the Windows App Store.

238
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
Crazy.

239
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,040
I want to take a moment and thank Ting for sponsoring this episode, our first episode

240
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,840
of Linux Action News. Do me a favor and go to last.ting.com. It's a little retro and

241
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,280
it's a little awesome, las.ting.com. It's a smarter way to do mobile and if you go to

242
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,720
that URL, you'll save some money. What I love about Ting, I've been a customer for more

243
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:09,760
than two and a half years, it's just pay for what you use wireless. And when I say this,

244
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,240
it sounds like, oh, geez, Chris, that's a really neat idea. There must be a trick. And

245
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,480
to some people, those would be people that live in the United States. And then there's

246
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,280
a group of people like a lot of you outside the United States that go, well, isn't that

247
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,680
kind of how, that's how my mobile works, Chris.

248
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:29,060
You see, if the U.S. were to hit reset on the mobile market today, the Ting model would

249
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:33,520
be the dominant model because it truly empowers the customer. If you've got Wi-Fi, there's

250
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,480
no sense in paying for gigs and gigs and gigs and gigs of data. There's no reason to use

251
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,640
that if you only need your data when you're driving from home to work or something like

252
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,120
that. Same with calls. Now that Telegram has calling, I'm never making a phone call again.

253
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,620
Now that the Echo has calling, I'm never making a phone call again. So why pay for minutes?

254
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,880
You think I'm kidding. I'm not. Find out more by going to last.ting.com. They've got a brand

255
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,240
new website. It looks super slick. It's pay for what you use wireless. And one of the

256
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,840
other things that's cool, and I mentioned this because we kind of have, you'd be surprised,

257
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,720
we kind of have a geeky audience. I know. I know. I wouldn't have thought so either.

258
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,120
But it turns out we do. And so they understand that there's CDMA and GSM. At least here in

259
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:16,700
the States, we've got both of them. We're maniacs like that. And on the Ting network,

260
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,080
you can choose either one that's better in your area. Maybe one's better for calls. Maybe

261
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,160
one's better for data. Or maybe one just makes you feel like a baller. Find out more by going

262
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:28,040
to last.ting.com. They've got a bunch of great features, a great dashboard, and more. But

263
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:33,480
I want you to take this away. It's $6 for the line, and then just your usage on top

264
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:43,280
of that. last.ting.com. And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Action News.

265
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,520
Just a quick headline for you guys this week. The OpenWRT and the LEED, our LEDE project,

266
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,880
have agreed on a peace plan. I didn't realize that there was a split happening here, but

267
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,600
I guess a set of core developers went off and started their own project from OpenWRT.

268
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,120
So you didn't know about this either. I kind of felt a bit stupid reading about this. I

269
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,320
should have known about it.

270
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,440
No, I did not. And I guess things have actually worked out for the better. Some of the core

271
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,280
developers are coming back. They're going to use the LEDE project as sort of the base,

272
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,580
but they're going to keep the OpenWRT branding. It's sort of a kumbaya, Joe. So look forward

273
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:19,720
to better firmwares on your edge devices soon. Speaking of edge devices, Google in Android

274
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,400
O is finally going to solve a major issue with Android. But I suppose, Joe, the question

275
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,800
is, does it go far enough?

276
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:32,400
No, in a word. It solves one of three problems, doesn't it? With the whole updating Android

277
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,000
situation where, first of all, you have to deal with the silicon manufacturers. So usually

278
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,160
Samsung or Qualcomm. So you have to deal with them first. Then you have to deal with the

279
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,760
actual phone manufacturers. And then you have to deal with the carriers. So you've got these

280
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:55,760
three steps that have to be dealt with before you can push out an over-the-air update. And

281
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:02,100
so Project Treble is going to make that a little bit easier because it's basically separating

282
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:09,160
the first layer of that off. So the code coming from the silicon manufacturers can stay the

283
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,920
same. And then everything on top of that can change.

284
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,620
Another way to frame that would be, now the silicon manufacturers don't have to be bothered

285
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,440
before everybody else in the stack can do an Android update.

286
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,100
Well, yeah, which is good. It's definitely a step forward. There's no doubt about it.

287
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,040
One of the things I didn't realize was such an issue, but apparently it's a big issue

288
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,980
in the Android ecosystem, is Qualcomm only certifies updating their chips, the drivers

289
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,160
for it and firmwares and whatnot for two years. Two years. And then, sorry, we're all done.

290
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,840
Well, that two-year cycle is basically the standard cycle in mobile, isn't it? Because

291
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,600
after two years, you've upgraded your phone, in theory.

292
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,400
In theory. Meanwhile, iOS devices, see, here's why I disagree with that. I disagree with

293
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,760
that because they get passed down. Like, especially in families, you pass your devices down, they

294
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,720
become gaming devices. They're still on the network. They still have your personal information

295
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,640
on them. In some cases, now they're used by children. So that's why iOS devices with a

296
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,480
five-year support cycle are much better for families where they want to do a pass down

297
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,480
thing.

298
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,080
Yeah. And if you just want to buy, I mean, buying an iPhone is an expensive endeavor

299
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,600
and buying a Pixel phone is an expensive endeavor if you buy it outright and not through your

300
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:23,700
carrier, right? And so you want to make that investment work. You want to be able to use

301
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,060
it for several years, not just like two years or even less than that if you've only bought

302
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,560
it like halfway through the cycle.

303
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,200
Right. And the Pixel is one of the first devices. In fact, if you already have the Android O

304
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,800
developer preview, you already have this, in theory. Also, I think it's worth mentioning,

305
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,280
this doesn't solve the carrier problem or the OEM problem, which I think is the core

306
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,960
problem. If the OEMs like Samsung or LG or HTC were truly motivated to support these

307
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,640
devices for longer, something tells me that that would be worked into their contract with

308
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,160
Qualcomm. They would be pressuring the devices manufacturers. They would be working on the

309
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,800
software stack. There's been no motivation at the hardware manufacturer layer for the

310
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,200
entire time of Android, which is a core problem because they want you to buy new devices.

311
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,360
Same at the carrier level. Here, at least in the States, it's within their best interest

312
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,180
for you to buy new devices. All the carriers now are offering plans where you just pay

313
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:21,760
a monthly price. Lease that phone, friend. Lease that phone and every 18 months you get

314
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,260
a brand new phone. Just keep upgrading, my friend, and then we can push you new services,

315
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,500
new network features, all kinds of upsell services that make them lots of money and

316
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:35,520
help them brand the device. So it's in everybody's interest to have you buy new devices.

317
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,720
Yeah. And can I point out a potential problem here? It's only a potential problem, but if

318
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,220
you are leaving the code from the silicon manufacturers there untouched, well that doesn't

319
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,020
necessarily help you in terms of security because what if there are zero days or whatever

320
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:56,760
found in that code? And if Qualcomm have decided that they're not supporting it anymore, then

321
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:02,260
yeah, okay, you can go and upgrade the Android stack and make that more secure. But if the

322
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,560
fundamental code run in the silicon has got vulnerabilities that are not being patched,

323
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,480
then this doesn't help that either.

324
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,560
I would say stay tuned. Another shoe could drop at Google IO on May 17th. May 17th through

325
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,680
the 19th is Google IO. So it's coming up very soon. This is sort of like a pre-announcement

326
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,880
and we could hear other parts that make it all click at Google IO. So that has to be

327
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,960
kept in mind. But right now, this is only step one in a three-step process. And in some

328
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,900
sense, Joe, it really doesn't make any sense unless you consider where Google may be going

329
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,680
with things like Project Fuchsia.

330
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:40,680
Yeah, exactly. So Project Fuchsia is their backup plan, I suppose, their mobile backup

331
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:47,200
plan, which is a completely different OS. It doesn't use Linux. It doesn't have the

332
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,520
Java virtual machine. It doesn't have all of the baggage of Android.

333
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:57,240
Right. It's licensed under BSD clause 3, MIT, and Apache 2.0. No GPL.

334
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,520
Exactly. Right. Which is something that Google, I mean, they've never been a huge fan of the

335
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:10,800
GPL. Let's face it. So the OS is called Fuchsia and the kernel is called Magenta and the kernel

336
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:16,640
is MIT licensed. And so this has been around for quite a while, but it's caused a bit of

337
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:25,880
a stir in the last week because of a demo that has surfaced with a UI called Armadillo,

338
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,160
which you can actually run on Android. And it's not complete at all, is it? I mean, it's

339
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,920
basically a skeleton of UI at this stage, but it does show that Google have not forgotten

340
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:40,320
about Fuchsia. Google are still working on it. And it's going to be open source, but

341
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,440
it's going to be that different kind of open source, isn't it, than Linux? It's going to

342
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:50,320
be the permissively licensed open source, which is better for, well, it's an easier

343
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,940
sell, isn't it, for big business.

344
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,620
It's corporate empire friendly. And when you look at this, it's really a landing spot for

345
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,520
some of their favorite projects. Dart is in on this thing to give you high-performance

346
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,400
graphics. They have Vulkan for the rendering. They have Escher, which is volumetric soft

347
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,480
shadows for some of their UI stuff. This is high-end GUI stuff. It's like their fantasy

348
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,800
project stuff. Now, all of this is neat and interesting. And with Google, some of this

349
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,600
stuff could go nowhere. They often launch products that compete with each other. Like

350
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,240
for years, the conversation is, well, Android and Chrome merge because they seem to be competing.

351
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,960
That's not unusual for Google. When you look at Project Treble and consider Fuchsia, it

352
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,220
could be that Treble would allow them to abstract away the hardware stuff, abstract away the

353
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,500
hardware drivers, and move over to Fuchsia without a whole bunch of device problems.

354
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,360
So at least Google's own devices, like the Pixel, maybe a Nexus device, could run Fuchsia.

355
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,260
But what about the problem of applications? I mean, that's always been the problem with

356
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:52,360
these new Linux-based operating systems, right, for the mobile. They don't have that wealth

357
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,900
of apps. I mean, there are millions and millions or a billion apps or whatever it is available

358
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:01,080
for Android. They're going to have to either convince everyone to rewrite their app to

359
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:05,600
work with Fuchsia, or they're going to have to write some sort of compatibility layer.

360
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,480
I hope it's the first one. I hope people...

361
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,480
So do I.

362
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,760
You know, wouldn't that be great if Android apps were all of a sudden 120 frames per second

363
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,560
just flying around and had great graphics and just loaded really smooth?

364
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
I mean, we have...

365
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
And didn't crash all the time.

366
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,080
Right. I mean, we have supercomputers in these phones, at least compared to when I was growing

367
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,600
up and now looking at these devices. I don't understand why they're so slow.

368
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Yeah.

369
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
Yeah.

370
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,960
So Fuchsia, it feels like one of these fascinating Skunk Works projects, but we don't really...

371
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,880
At least I won't speak for you, Joe, but I don't really have any expectations it's going

372
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,960
to go anywhere.

373
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,840
I do. I do think it is going to go somewhere because that's how Google does things. They

374
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,720
always hedge their bets, don't they? They will never just have one product for things

375
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:53,480
or very, very seldom. And eventually one will win out and they'll kill the other one. But

376
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,360
I mean, just look at their messaging fiasco at the moment. How many ways have you got

377
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,320
to send someone a message through Google?

378
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,120
Oh, you're getting me worked up right now just thinking about it. Yeah. Allo, you have

379
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:08,560
Allo, Duo, Hangouts, of course. I mean, there's so many. Yeah. And then of course there's

380
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:14,920
Google Doc Chat. Yeah. Yeah. And you know, maybe, maybe something will be announced next

381
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:18,840
week, or this week, May 17th. Maybe something will be announced at Google IO Keynote. They'll

382
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,460
just be unbelievable. I don't really expect that you and I are going to talk a lot about

383
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,320
mobile and Android on this show. This is go figure as we're launching the show. This is

384
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,920
the big news right now. So we're talking about it now, but I don't know, Joe. I think down

385
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,080
the road you and I probably won't be talking about it much. That's my instinct. I could

386
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,480
be totally wrong. And of course this is going to be the week that will prove me wrong.

387
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,720
I don't know, man. I have to disagree with that. The way I see it, the desktop, okay,

388
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,960
it's never going to go away. Of course, you're always going to have people using it on the

389
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:54,000
desktop, be it Windows, Mac OS or Linux, hopefully. But we have seen the growth of mobile and

390
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,320
it's not going away. And hopefully Linux is going to continue to be a big part of that.

391
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,480
But I think that while people are primarily using Android devices or mobile devices at

392
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,760
least, we've got to talk about that. We can't ignore the reality that desktop Linux like

393
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,080
desktop computing generally is on the wane.

394
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,400
It hurts, but I think you're right. I have more and more people in my personal life that

395
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,080
when they go home, they don't have a computer. They just use their mobile device.

396
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,880
Well, you're talking to one of them now, Chris, I'm afraid. Yeah, seriously. Okay. I have

397
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,400
my desktop, I have a ton of laptops, but my primary device is my Android phone running

398
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,480
Lineage on this, because it's always with me.

399
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:41,480
You want to know something funny? My middle child, Abigail, this weekend said to us, how

400
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,360
come you guys don't have to pay for your home? And we said, what do you mean? We pay for

401
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,000
our home? No, no. When my mommy pays for home, she uses her computer, but you don't have

402
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,380
a computer here. So you don't pay for your home. And we said, no, trust us. We pay, we

403
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,640
just don't use a computer to do it. And that's when I realized, yeah, most of the time when

404
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,560
I'm at home, there's not even, there might be a laptop in a bag somewhere, but there's

405
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,000
no computer set up at home anymore on it on when I'm at home and I'm not working anymore

406
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,560
because I have, I have connectivity on my television. I have my phone, I have tablets.

407
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:17,120
So Joe, while I want to sit here and disagree with you, the reality, even in my own home

408
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:21,760
would say otherwise. Yep, exactly. Now I would love to hear your thoughts on anything we

409
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,560
talked about or that particular subject. You can go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact

410
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,200
to send us in your feedback or just email us directly news at jupiterbroadcasting.com

411
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:38,680
or you can tweet us at linuxactionnews.com with stories or feedback. Yeah. And also the

412
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:45,920
new Jupiter Broadcasting Telegram group. Bit dot L Y slash J B Telegram. Bit dot L Y slash

413
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,480
J B Telegram. We just launched it. We're only telling you guys it's a Linux action news

414
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,480
secret bit dot L Y slash J B Telegram. If you want to get on the official Jupiter Broadcasting

415
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,840
Telegram group and there is something you can do to help the show out, subscribing your

416
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,160
favorite podcast player. If you or even just a few of you do it this week, it'll help with

417
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:09,080
discovery because the way it works is they got these crazy python scripts. When you subscribe,

418
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,560
the numbers count up, boop, boop, boop, and even 10, 30, 40 of you do it and we'll move

419
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,120
way up in the charts and people will find this new show. You can actually help us out

420
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,220
this week by subscribing. We have links to all of them and all of the subscription services

421
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:27,520
at linuxactionnews.com. Maybe not all of them, but pretty close. And you know what, Chris?

422
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:33,240
The dirty secret of a lot of our listeners is that they use iTunes. What? Yeah. And you

423
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,000
know, even if, even if you don't want to admit it, we won't tell anybody, but there is another

424
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,960
dirty secret. You are our potential white knights. We need them here at the Linux action

425
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:49,000
news. Of course you can save us by reviewing or rating an iTunes. You actually don't only

426
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,040
juice iTunes for us, but you juice like a dozen other podcast directories who all just

427
00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:00,160
scrape iTunes. That's why iTunes is the bosses. Many, many podcast players, websites and apps

428
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,660
are actually just scraping iTunes. And if you rate and review in there, you can help

429
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,400
us out a bunch and not a lot of you want to even admit to using iTunes. So if you're one

430
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,420
of them, please consider doing it right then. I suppose that'll do it for this episode.

431
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,720
So we'll see you again next Monday. Be sure to go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe

432
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,880
for all of our feed links and thanks for joining us guys. See you later.
