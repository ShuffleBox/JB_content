00:00.000 --> 00:09.360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News Episode 142, recorded on January 26th, 2020.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.360
I'm Chris.

00:10.360 --> 00:11.360
And I'm Joe.

00:11.360 --> 00:12.360
Hello, Joe.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.680
Good to be connected with you, although not so good to start out with a story that gets

00:15.680 --> 00:17.240
me all fired up.

00:17.240 --> 00:21.520
Yeah, we have to start with bad news again, and this is that Rocket League will no longer

00:21.520 --> 00:26.640
be supported on Mac and Linux after March.

00:26.640 --> 00:32.440
That really upsets me because, A, we play Rocket League in my household, B, I have been

00:32.440 --> 00:38.240
to some awesome Rocket League tournaments at Linux Fest Northwest, all on Linux, and

00:38.240 --> 00:41.400
it was a very memorable experience for me and the boy.

00:41.400 --> 00:48.340
And three or C, whatever I'm on, I'm so frustrated now, it was one of the example launch platforms

00:48.340 --> 00:49.340
for SteamOS.

00:49.340 --> 00:55.480
And so it's, I mean, it really stings, Joe, it just stings so hard because, A, I've bought

00:55.480 --> 01:02.280
this thing three times over for Linux, and, Z, it has started a whole round of trolling

01:02.280 --> 01:06.200
by developers who are using this as an opportunity to shame Linux.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.240
Well, that's one way to look at it.

01:08.240 --> 01:12.960
And yes, there has been some trolling, which I'm choosing to ignore.

01:12.960 --> 01:18.200
But the reality of this situation is that Psyonix and Epic want to make changes.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.660
They want to upgrade the DirectX version.

01:21.660 --> 01:26.760
And it is not economically viable for them to make the equivalent changes on the Linux

01:26.760 --> 01:28.500
version and the Mac version.

01:28.500 --> 01:37.820
Because combined, they say that Linux and Mac users form under 0.3% of the user base.

01:37.820 --> 01:39.580
So what's Linux then?

01:39.580 --> 01:44.000
Let's say 0.15, let's be charitable on that.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.520
It would be fiscally irresponsible of them to spend resources supporting Linux.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.200
They just can't do that.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.200
Yeah, okay.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.440
That is the hard number and there's no avoiding.

01:55.440 --> 02:01.040
Yeah, when you combine both of Mac and Linux together, it's still only 0.3%.

02:01.040 --> 02:06.300
And considering it was one of the early games to support the platform, and it's a fairly

02:06.300 --> 02:11.920
well known game, and it's often featured in eSports, you'd think it'd be one of the more

02:11.920 --> 02:12.920
popular ones.

02:12.920 --> 02:18.440
Well, yeah, the thing is that it is very popular in our community, in the desktop Linux community.

02:18.440 --> 02:23.460
But I think that sometimes we delude ourselves about how popular desktop Linux really is

02:23.460 --> 02:25.600
in the grand scheme of things.

02:25.600 --> 02:32.840
And gaming on Linux is a tiny niche of basically a tiny niche of computing.

02:32.840 --> 02:38.860
And although a few hundred people that we know of might be into it, maybe even less

02:38.860 --> 02:44.680
than that, and they're very vocal about it, the reality is that gaming on Linux is not

02:44.680 --> 02:49.400
really as big a thing as a lot of people like to pretend.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.280
I can't argue with your core point there.

02:52.280 --> 02:55.300
But I think there are benefits to porting to Linux.

02:55.300 --> 02:59.340
It's a great way to find performance issues that can actually improve your primary platforms

02:59.340 --> 03:00.840
edition as well.

03:00.840 --> 03:07.840
But if you base it around the correct technologies, like Vulkan, for example, instead of DirectX,

03:07.840 --> 03:15.200
then future platforms like potential gaming Chromebooks, or Android, or even iOS and MacOS

03:15.200 --> 03:16.200
with MoltenVK.

03:16.200 --> 03:21.880
So you open yourself up automatically to just options if you adopt the right standards.

03:21.880 --> 03:24.800
Although that does not necessarily apply in the case of Rocket League.

03:24.800 --> 03:27.440
They've started development many years ago.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.960
They're committed to the DirectX platform.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.080
And then there's the other elephant in the room here.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.880
And they even pointed out in an update that we'll have linked in the show notes, the reality

03:36.880 --> 03:39.800
is Proton is a thing.

03:39.800 --> 03:43.400
And they expect that it will continue to play under Proton.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.740
They say it won't be officially supported.

03:45.740 --> 03:48.080
But their argument backs up what you're saying, Joe.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.800
It just doesn't make financial sense.

03:49.800 --> 03:57.120
If natively 0.3% of customers are playing on Linux or Mac, and that 0.3% could use Proton,

03:57.120 --> 04:01.760
or at least a good portion of them, how can you argue that?

04:01.760 --> 04:07.360
You could just see that conversation going nowhere in some sort of meeting, and there's

04:07.360 --> 04:08.920
really just no way to argue it.

04:08.920 --> 04:13.040
It's just absolutely disappointing, I guess, as somebody who was a big fan of this initiative

04:13.040 --> 04:16.000
many years ago, to see we're still at this point.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Yeah.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.660
To be clear, you will still be able to play it offline after March, but you just won't

04:21.660 --> 04:26.320
get any updates, and you're just going to be playing one player.

04:26.320 --> 04:30.280
And some people have said, well, why can't they just make it so that at least Linux players

04:30.280 --> 04:32.720
can play against each other online?

04:32.720 --> 04:35.360
And that's just a naive question.

04:35.360 --> 04:39.360
That takes resources to allow to happen, and there's still going to need to be some sort

04:39.360 --> 04:44.640
of security updates and potential bug fixes, which is all costing them money, which they

04:44.640 --> 04:47.720
just can't really justify.

04:47.720 --> 04:52.960
But they are going to refund people, at least, and they're breaking the steam rule.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.360
Normally, if you've had a game more than two weeks, or if you've played it more than two

04:56.360 --> 04:58.400
hours, you can't get a refund.

04:58.400 --> 05:03.240
But that actually didn't work at first, but they said they're sorting it out and you can

05:03.240 --> 05:07.480
open a support ticket, so at least you can get your money back if you've bought it.

05:07.480 --> 05:11.800
And this is a good reminder that it is a complicated path for developers to make a great game for

05:11.800 --> 05:12.800
Linux.

05:12.800 --> 05:18.520
And if they haven't chosen the correct path, which hasn't always even been available, they

05:18.520 --> 05:19.520
may end up here.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.240
If they want to move the game forward, if it's a popular game and they want to move

05:22.240 --> 05:28.040
it to a new stack of the technology they base their graphics on, a new set of APIs, there

05:28.040 --> 05:32.520
could be other games out there like this, I don't know if it's directly an indictment

05:32.520 --> 05:34.840
of the Linux platform.

05:34.840 --> 05:40.640
Because I go back to my original point, if they had created this game in 2019 or 2018

05:40.640 --> 05:45.720
and used Vulkan instead of DirectX 9, they may never be in this position.

05:45.720 --> 05:50.800
There may be some influence from upstairs at Epic, but from their explanation, it simply

05:50.800 --> 05:53.560
just comes down to updating from DirectX 9 to 11.

05:53.560 --> 05:57.660
Yeah, it seems like a reasonable technical explanation to me rather than Epic buying

05:57.660 --> 06:00.160
them and then shutting out the Linux players.

06:00.160 --> 06:05.160
It's clear that if Linux had a larger player base, this wouldn't be such an easy argument

06:05.160 --> 06:06.160
to decide.

06:06.160 --> 06:10.760
They'd have to, like if it was, imagine just for a moment, just crazy here, but imagine

06:10.760 --> 06:16.560
if it was 10%, then maybe they'd be a little less inclined to just cut it off.

06:16.560 --> 06:21.280
But there's nothing we can do other than just get more people using Linux and then convincing

06:21.280 --> 06:25.440
them to pay good hard earned money for games that are not free software.

06:25.440 --> 06:30.120
Yeah, or convince devs to use open standards like Vulkan to make the games in the first

06:30.120 --> 06:31.120
place.

06:31.120 --> 06:32.920
And maybe Stadia will help that.

06:32.920 --> 06:33.920
Who knows?

06:33.920 --> 06:39.920
In the meantime, good old reliable wine that just continues to chug on decade after decade

06:39.920 --> 06:44.800
has released version 5 now, which is remarkable because I remember discussing when version

06:44.800 --> 06:46.160
1.0 came out.

06:46.160 --> 06:49.240
But there's some major improvements in this new version of wine.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.720
Yeah, a lot of that work on Proton from CodeWeavers is landing in 5.0.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.760
Yeah, this has been a year in the works.

06:55.760 --> 07:00.280
So a lot of stuff that has just sort of been accumulating hits here as the official release

07:00.280 --> 07:07.200
also dramatically improved multi-monitor support, Vulkan 1.1 support, but maybe something that's

07:07.200 --> 07:13.360
more significant, I don't know yet, is they've changed the way they build modules.

07:13.360 --> 07:19.320
In the past, they built them in the ELF format, the executable linkable format, which is the

07:19.320 --> 07:22.400
generic file format for executables and Linux systems.

07:22.400 --> 07:28.400
Instead of building it as an ELF, the modules have been built as the Windows PE format,

07:28.400 --> 07:31.640
which is the Windows file format for executables.

07:31.640 --> 07:37.640
And the reason why that matters is games and piracy checkers are looking for those differences.

07:37.640 --> 07:42.820
And by wine shifting over to the Windows PE format, it's one less thing to trigger these

07:42.820 --> 07:47.400
gotcha systems or any kind of detection system to realize it's not on Windows.

07:47.400 --> 07:48.640
That's a major leap.

07:48.640 --> 07:50.880
I have yet to test if it really makes a difference.

07:50.880 --> 07:54.640
I'm definitely looking for feedback, linuxactionnews.com slash contact.

07:54.640 --> 07:59.040
But all of the other features combined with this new executable format makes Wine 5.0

07:59.040 --> 08:00.040
really impressive.

08:00.040 --> 08:03.560
I really hope that means that gamers can get around this anti-cheat stuff because that

08:03.560 --> 08:08.800
is one of the biggest concerns that I heard regarding the Rocket League news is that they'll

08:08.800 --> 08:12.800
inevitably add some of that and then it will break it in Proton and then you'll be stuck

08:12.800 --> 08:15.120
only using Windows to play it.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.200
Yeah, that's exactly what I'd love to hear feedback on.

08:17.200 --> 08:22.320
But Joe, what if you ever wanted to, I don't know, run a desktop application on an Android

08:22.320 --> 08:23.320
device?

08:23.320 --> 08:25.040
Maybe you don't have access to a desktop.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.040
You only got Android.

08:26.040 --> 08:28.480
Or maybe you're running Android on your desktop for some reason.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.880
Yeah, maybe you're running Android x86.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.640
This is something that I'd not really thought about much before.

08:33.640 --> 08:38.880
But I read an article on XTA developers that pointed out that Wine is available for Android

08:38.880 --> 08:39.880
as well.

08:39.880 --> 08:46.360
Now, because Wine is not an emulator, as we know, it means you can't use x86 applications

08:46.360 --> 08:48.160
on an ARM CPU.

08:48.160 --> 08:51.960
But increasingly, we're seeing more of the Windows ARM stuff.

08:51.960 --> 08:52.960
So it seems interesting.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.980
I'm going to have to try this out, I think.

08:54.980 --> 08:55.980
That's pretty slick, Joe.

08:55.980 --> 09:00.320
But I'm more about running my Android apps in the cloud and Canonical might just have

09:00.320 --> 09:01.320
something for me.

09:01.320 --> 09:06.280
Yeah, and box cloud that they've announced this week with quite a lot of fanfare.

09:06.280 --> 09:09.080
And unfortunately, not a lot of detail.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.620
Oh, I get it.

09:10.620 --> 09:11.620
What detail do you need?

09:11.620 --> 09:13.980
It's Android apps in the cloud.

09:13.980 --> 09:14.980
Actually think about it.

09:14.980 --> 09:16.800
I see a couple of use cases for it.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.380
It creates an on-demand experience for gamers.

09:19.380 --> 09:24.200
So you could have phones that are lower specs, say free phones for certain carriers that

09:24.200 --> 09:27.160
are still fully capable of running games.

09:27.160 --> 09:30.700
You could even sell that as part of a monthly subscription.

09:30.700 --> 09:35.520
This is a big way for carriers to say, hey, look at the capability of our 5G network.

09:35.520 --> 09:40.440
But outside of gaming, I mean, think about all kinds of ways to test multiple different

09:40.440 --> 09:43.340
types of virtual Android devices in the cloud.

09:43.340 --> 09:47.400
You could have different, maybe even thousands of hardware configurations, and you spin it

09:47.400 --> 09:51.240
all up at once and test your application and laugh in the face of fragmentation.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.840
Yeah, I can definitely see a lot of use cases for it.

09:53.840 --> 09:59.240
But what I couldn't seem to find was to what extent this is open source and how easy is

09:59.240 --> 10:00.240
to run on premises.

10:00.240 --> 10:05.600
I know they've partnered with packet to make it possible to run it on premises, but to

10:05.600 --> 10:09.100
what extent are you going to have to rely on them?

10:09.100 --> 10:10.840
It's just all a bit unclearly.

10:10.840 --> 10:16.680
There's a lot of hype and business speak, but there's not a lot of detail about the

10:16.680 --> 10:20.520
technical aspects of exactly how it's going to work.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.000
If you have to ask that, then you can't afford it.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
I don't know.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.920
You basically have to pay them, it seems canonical, to get this going.

10:27.920 --> 10:31.280
I think it is very much a service, whether it be on premises or in their cloud.

10:31.280 --> 10:36.560
I actually kind of like that in a way, that you have the option of having it on premise,

10:36.560 --> 10:42.460
but still have the ease of management of something that's outsourced and taken care of.

10:42.460 --> 10:44.240
Businesses and enterprises love that kind of thing.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.720
I just love that.

10:45.720 --> 10:48.960
So that's sort of in line, I think, with who the potential customer base is.

10:48.960 --> 10:55.280
I don't think it's so much you or I individuals, but companies that want to build an experience

10:55.280 --> 10:56.280
around this.

10:56.280 --> 11:02.480
Again, I go back to the carrier image that comes preloaded with a stream Fortnite button.

11:02.480 --> 11:03.800
Oh, yeah, definitely.

11:03.800 --> 11:10.800
This is not aimed at tinkerers and people like me, but it's just a bit disappointing

11:10.800 --> 11:16.720
to me because the good thing about everything that Canonical does is it is all open source.

11:16.720 --> 11:20.960
Although yes, a lot of it is aimed at the cloud and enterprise, you can actually dig

11:20.960 --> 11:21.960
into the code.

11:21.960 --> 11:27.120
You can run it on your own test systems or whatever, whereas this seems to be...

11:27.120 --> 11:30.600
Maybe I'm completely off base here, but just the way this has been marketed in a couple

11:30.600 --> 11:34.800
of blog posts on the Ubuntu blog is like that doesn't really matter to them, and it's just

11:34.800 --> 11:37.200
all about enterprise and cloud.

11:37.200 --> 11:38.600
I could agree with that.

11:38.600 --> 11:43.280
The only way I might change that is those details don't matter to the customer base

11:43.280 --> 11:45.320
they're pitching this to, so they didn't write about it.

11:45.320 --> 11:46.320
Yeah, you're right.

11:46.320 --> 11:50.200
And hopefully I'm wrong about this, and in the next few days we'll see some more technical

11:50.200 --> 11:51.200
details of it.

11:51.200 --> 11:52.440
But you know, look at this.

11:52.440 --> 11:58.160
Anbox was originally written for the Ubuntu phone, which as we know, they abandoned and

11:58.160 --> 12:00.240
the Ubiports guys picked it up.

12:00.240 --> 12:05.160
But what we're seeing here is them pivoting that technology that they have originally

12:05.160 --> 12:10.600
written to something that can actually make them some money here in the cloud as usual.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.080
I had a similar thought when I read the story.

12:13.080 --> 12:19.480
My thought was it's nice to see a real coming together of different canonical technologies

12:19.480 --> 12:21.080
into a solid service offering.

12:21.080 --> 12:24.480
And I think it speaks well for the company.

12:24.480 --> 12:29.920
Take the service or its licensing aside, the ability to take an acquisition, take different

12:29.920 --> 12:33.840
technology expertise, and layer a service offering on top of it with their Ubuntu Advantage

12:33.840 --> 12:38.640
program additionally, because it's 1804 and LXD powering this whole thing.

12:38.640 --> 12:44.940
So it really is, yeah, a coming together of everything, and then they've productized it.

12:44.940 --> 12:48.080
It's I think a good sign for Canonical's ability to execute right now.

12:48.080 --> 12:51.720
Yes, further evidence of them getting very serious about the business side of things

12:51.720 --> 12:53.720
and actually making some money.

12:53.720 --> 12:58.620
Google's getting a lot more serious about Chrome OS and education and is giving a pretty

12:58.620 --> 13:02.480
generous update to the support of future devices.

13:02.480 --> 13:06.620
This was a bit confusing this week because there was some reporting earlier on that suggested

13:06.620 --> 13:11.720
that all new Chromebooks would get eight years of support, and then with various updates

13:11.720 --> 13:17.540
and kind of a back and forth with Google, it turns out that some of the Chrome OS education

13:17.540 --> 13:23.040
devices will be getting eight years of support, but not necessarily every Chromebook.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.040
Right.

13:24.040 --> 13:30.720
So previously, and I guess essentially still, most Chrome OS devices will receive six years

13:30.720 --> 13:34.920
of software support, but Google is extending the length of time it plans to support new

13:34.920 --> 13:39.160
Chrome OS education devices with security and platform updates.

13:39.160 --> 13:44.880
So starting in 2020 with initially two devices, one from Lenovo and one from Acer, they will

13:44.880 --> 13:48.940
get automatic updates until June 2028.

13:48.940 --> 13:53.960
To pay for the additional support, Google is also increasing the price of its Chrome

13:53.960 --> 13:58.480
education upgrade, which is a one-time license that school boards can purchase, which is

13:58.480 --> 14:00.340
usually a pretty large scale.

14:00.340 --> 14:05.880
So it's going from $30 to $38 per device, which doesn't initially sound like a lot,

14:05.880 --> 14:12.280
but if you're buying 5,000 or 10,000 of them, it can add up.

14:12.280 --> 14:16.200
But it means that investment also lasts considerably longer.

14:16.200 --> 14:21.320
So I think when you look at the cost to support, it's a pretty reasonable price increase from

14:21.320 --> 14:22.320
$30 to $38.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.320
Yeah.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.840
And you're not going to get eight years of support out of an iPad, are you?

14:25.840 --> 14:28.240
You're going to get what, about five or six?

14:28.240 --> 14:29.240
Yeah.

14:29.240 --> 14:34.040
I mean, they'll continue to use them for another five, but they won't be supported.

14:34.040 --> 14:38.800
The other knobs Google is turning here to make these more attractive to educators is

14:38.800 --> 14:43.200
alongside the new devices, they're adding new search features to the Chromebook app

14:43.200 --> 14:47.560
hub that teachers use that make it easier for the teachers to find specific programs.

14:47.560 --> 14:52.120
So they've tailored a UI for educators to find specific things.

14:52.120 --> 14:53.120
But here's another one.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.680
I don't know how this would have affected you as a child, Joe, but Google is rolling

14:56.680 --> 15:02.640
out originality reports, a feature that has been beta testing.

15:02.640 --> 15:07.140
It's designed to help detect plagiarism.

15:07.140 --> 15:14.360
So it looks at, quote, helps both teachers and students spot plagiarism because it can

15:14.360 --> 15:15.360
look at everything.

15:15.360 --> 15:20.040
And of course it has the power of Google and they're feeding this machine all the time.

15:20.040 --> 15:23.720
And then different teachers, when you assign them like an English teacher role, get access

15:23.720 --> 15:26.080
to these features, which will start rolling out over the next month.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.620
It's going to support multiple languages.

15:28.620 --> 15:32.400
And you could see like as an educator, you'd be looking at that going, hmm, eight years

15:32.400 --> 15:36.960
of support, helps with built in app search, takes care of a lot of the maintenance.

15:36.960 --> 15:39.680
It's easy to shuck these things when they got to go.

15:39.680 --> 15:43.640
And now it helps detect plagiarism and they keep adding features like this, really making

15:43.640 --> 15:47.000
it ideal when you add in the management features and all that stuff too.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.920
Plagiarism was not a problem when I was a kid because I didn't really have access to

15:50.920 --> 15:51.920
the internet.

15:51.920 --> 15:52.920
I had no Wikipedia.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.720
The only thing I had was Altavista on school computers.

15:55.720 --> 15:58.080
So I wrote all my own essays.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.080
Thank you very much.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.080
No cheating from me.

16:00.080 --> 16:04.440
I may have done it once and it may have been one of my best graded papers, but I was a

16:04.440 --> 16:05.440
pioneer.

16:05.440 --> 16:10.440
As long as the nineties, so I'll have to tell that story one day, but not today, no, not

16:10.440 --> 16:11.440
today.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.440
I really like to see this.

16:12.440 --> 16:17.960
I, I'm not a huge fan of Chromebooks in schools, but I'm also a pretty big fan of my text dollars

16:17.960 --> 16:23.240
being used effectively and eight years of support is pretty reasonable.

16:23.240 --> 16:28.760
I've seen sectors of the industry where some systems have 30 years of support.

16:28.760 --> 16:33.200
I know it's not reasonable, especially for education devices because students are very

16:33.200 --> 16:34.780
hard on them.

16:34.780 --> 16:38.640
So eight years is a pretty reasonable compromise.

16:38.640 --> 16:43.360
Do you really think that any of these devices will last eight years in the hands of kids?

16:43.360 --> 16:45.640
It seems very unlikely to me.

16:45.640 --> 16:46.640
Possibly not.

16:46.640 --> 16:50.600
I could also see different sellers that come up with agreements with the different districts

16:50.600 --> 16:52.940
to do replacements and swaps.

16:52.940 --> 16:57.960
And the thing is too, when you buy 5,000 of these, you end up with a few hundred in the

16:57.960 --> 17:01.820
IT department that you can use for Frankenstein parts and you can keep machines running for

17:01.820 --> 17:02.960
a really long time that way.

17:02.960 --> 17:03.960
Yeah, true.

17:03.960 --> 17:07.560
It's about having a reference device that if you're going to replace them and then it's

17:07.560 --> 17:09.620
not something completely different.

17:09.620 --> 17:15.880
So there is a very clever strategy by Google to basically take on Apple in education and

17:15.880 --> 17:20.840
Microsoft to some extent, but it also rubs me a little bit the wrong way.

17:20.840 --> 17:25.720
I suppose I'd rather have them use Chromebooks than iPads.

17:25.720 --> 17:30.200
At least it's a bit more like a proper computer and you can get a terminal and stuff on there

17:30.200 --> 17:31.200
if you want to.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.540
I mean, there's reality and then there's what I'd like.

17:34.540 --> 17:39.520
In Chris's world, Endless would have some sort of massive education deal and just be

17:39.520 --> 17:42.720
a total dominator in the education space.

17:42.720 --> 17:47.000
And these students would be using Linux technologies with endless hardware and an endless desktop,

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
which I think would be great for schools.

17:50.000 --> 17:54.000
And that would be the education workstation of children of the future.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.840
But we don't live in that fantasy world.

17:55.840 --> 17:59.400
We live in a world where you need a large corporation to make deals with large districts

17:59.400 --> 18:03.080
and shuck and jive on prices with hardware manufacturers in between, they get squeezed

18:03.080 --> 18:04.080
on both ends.

18:04.080 --> 18:10.280
And yeah, that's the world we live in and Chrome OS is, well, I guess it's not Windows.

18:10.280 --> 18:11.280
I don't know.

18:11.280 --> 18:15.600
Actually, sometimes I wonder because at least Windows would be a local company, Microsoft's

18:15.600 --> 18:16.600
in my backyard.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.920
So yeah, I don't know, Joe.

18:18.920 --> 18:19.920
I don't know.

18:19.920 --> 18:26.360
But I do know that I have little faith that the Free Software's Upcycle Windows 7 initiative

18:26.360 --> 18:27.360
is going to be successful.

18:27.360 --> 18:34.540
Yeah, so the Free Software Foundation posted this article, Upcycle Windows 7, and talking

18:34.540 --> 18:37.600
about how Windows 7 has reached its end of life now.

18:37.600 --> 18:41.300
And the best thing that Microsoft could do is make it free software.

18:41.300 --> 18:44.800
You could make the environmental argument because it would keep machines out of the

18:44.800 --> 18:46.540
landfill.

18:46.540 --> 18:48.560
And Microsoft's big on that these days.

18:48.560 --> 18:53.160
They write on the Free Software Foundation post, we call on them to release it as free

18:53.160 --> 18:57.680
software and give it to the community to study and improve as there is already a precedent

18:57.680 --> 19:01.360
for releasing some core Windows utilities free software.

19:01.360 --> 19:04.780
Microsoft has nothing to lose by liberating a version of their operating system that they

19:04.780 --> 19:07.080
themselves have say it's reached an end.

19:07.080 --> 19:11.520
You know, that's kind of, I mean, it doesn't take into account like intellectual property

19:11.520 --> 19:15.040
agreements and the fact that there's tons of components of Windows that have been licensed

19:15.040 --> 19:18.480
from third party creators and they don't want that open sourced, I suppose they can rip

19:18.480 --> 19:19.480
all that out.

19:19.480 --> 19:22.780
But where they kind of go a little bit off the rails with me, Joe, is when they get kind

19:22.780 --> 19:27.920
of demandy, quote, we demand that Windows 7 be released as free software.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.800
It's life doesn't have to end.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.760
Give it to the community to study, modify and share.

19:32.760 --> 19:38.000
And then to like try to make it as if you don't do this, then you don't love Linux.

19:38.000 --> 19:43.560
They write, we want more proof that you really respect users and users freedom and aren't

19:43.560 --> 19:47.320
just using those concepts as marketing when convenient.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.760
Which like as if these two are related at all.

19:49.760 --> 19:56.960
My question to you, is this a PR stunt or do they actually think this could work and

19:56.960 --> 20:02.120
are sort of unaware of all of the legal entanglements that would exist with something like that?

20:02.120 --> 20:05.680
That is a very difficult question to answer and I actually had a conversation with my

20:05.680 --> 20:09.840
wife about this and she said that, yes, that's exactly what it is.

20:09.840 --> 20:13.580
They're not really expecting Microsoft to do this.

20:13.580 --> 20:21.480
This is just an attempt to create some debate and maybe move the Overton window slightly.

20:21.480 --> 20:24.560
And it's not them just being completely deluded.

20:24.560 --> 20:25.560
But I don't know.

20:25.560 --> 20:31.300
I had really hoped that when Stallman left the FSF, they would get real and sort of become

20:31.300 --> 20:35.160
a bit more, well, in touch with reality.

20:35.160 --> 20:40.720
And this kind of thing suggests that maybe they're not either that or they're just doing

20:40.720 --> 20:44.640
epic trolling because apart from the stuff that you've mentioned, there's of course the

20:44.640 --> 20:49.160
issue that a lot of Windows 10 is based on Windows 7.

20:49.160 --> 20:54.580
And not only that, to throw code over the wall is not straightforward.

20:54.580 --> 20:58.420
You have to spend resources cleaning it up and there's probably some quite embarrassing

20:58.420 --> 21:00.760
stuff in that source code.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.180
So it just could never happen.

21:03.180 --> 21:07.720
And they say the precedent and they link to the open sourcing of Calculator.

21:07.720 --> 21:12.280
Now even open sourcing that Calculator was probably quite a big effort to clean the code

21:12.280 --> 21:15.720
up compared to an operating system.

21:15.720 --> 21:18.760
I just really hope this is them trolling for publicity.

21:18.760 --> 21:24.240
I'll give you my most skeptical take on it is it's a grab for mailing list signups that

21:24.240 --> 21:29.900
they can then pester for donations because they end with, we need your help to send Microsoft

21:29.900 --> 21:30.900
a strong message.

21:30.900 --> 21:39.060
We want 7,777 supporters to take a stand with us not just for ourselves but for future generations.

21:39.060 --> 21:43.120
Please stand with us today and sign below to show your support.

21:43.120 --> 21:49.060
Now you're not signing up for a mailing list about this in the future.

21:49.060 --> 21:52.720
It's not like a change.org petition.

21:52.720 --> 21:57.000
You are signing up for their primary mailing list.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.520
So what it says right here.

21:58.520 --> 22:02.320
This is the Free Software Foundation's primary mailing list.

22:02.320 --> 22:05.560
Subscribers receive a monthly newsletter called the Free Software Supporter which includes

22:05.560 --> 22:12.480
news about the FSF activities over that month as well as other news and requests for donations.

22:12.480 --> 22:17.880
It's a grab for a mailing list signup and it sounds like I'm being really skeptical

22:17.880 --> 22:22.800
but the reality is for an organization like the Free Software Foundation that mailing

22:22.800 --> 22:24.760
list is their lifeblood.

22:24.760 --> 22:32.880
It is extremely valuable and they've gotten 4,111 new subscribers thanks to this already.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.880
And maybe that's a good thing.

22:34.880 --> 22:40.320
Maybe we need more people hearing the good news about the foundation and free software

22:40.320 --> 22:46.060
and maybe it just takes a slightly disingenuous campaign to get them the good word.

22:46.060 --> 22:50.780
I don't know how I feel about that but I guess you could justify it that way.

22:50.780 --> 22:52.760
That sounds a little disingenuous to me though.

22:52.760 --> 22:57.120
Well, to be fair to them you don't have to sign up to the mailing list to sign this petition.

22:57.120 --> 23:02.880
There's a checkbox which says sign me up which you can just leave unchecked.

23:02.880 --> 23:09.000
So of those 4,000 odd people who have signed who knows how many did check the box.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.040
It's kind of your instinct to check the box.

23:11.040 --> 23:15.320
Well because the way it's arranged it's like you're not done unless you check that box.

23:15.320 --> 23:18.280
That's what it kind of looks like but you can sign up without it.

23:18.280 --> 23:21.240
Yeah and you're right and perhaps a lot of people do and maybe it has nothing to do with

23:21.240 --> 23:23.840
the mailing list at all and they just happen to put that in there because what a great

23:23.840 --> 23:29.800
opportunity but when I look at all and I look at the likelihood that this is going to succeed

23:29.800 --> 23:35.480
and if I want to believe that the people running the foundation are intelligent and I do want

23:35.480 --> 23:40.280
to believe that then I have to believe that they know this would never happen because

23:40.280 --> 23:47.160
of like you said current products are still based on the source code and legal entanglements

23:47.160 --> 23:52.440
not to mention the support costs and Microsoft because of their stature in the industry would

23:52.440 --> 23:57.040
need to do it properly so it need to be staffed and it's just never going to happen right

23:57.040 --> 24:01.040
and then you combine that with this sort of jab at the end that's designed to really rile

24:01.040 --> 24:05.040
people up and then this mailing list sign up which is right here right where you signed

24:05.040 --> 24:10.720
where you're signing the petition that's the checkbox and then you hit submit.

24:10.720 --> 24:15.560
I don't know could be could be totally wrong on this one but I just don't like the feel

24:15.560 --> 24:21.040
of it and I like you was indeed hoping for a change in tone and this is a little silly

24:21.040 --> 24:23.760
but I guess it raises awareness.

24:23.760 --> 24:27.680
Well we're talking about it it's interesting though that they've edited the original post

24:27.680 --> 24:32.120
because when I first read it there was language in there talking about how Microsoft had poisoned

24:32.120 --> 24:36.980
education and it seemed like if you really want them to do this then that's not the way

24:36.980 --> 24:42.520
to go about it and maybe after people pointed that out they cleaned it up I don't know but

24:42.520 --> 24:48.800
yeah I have to believe you I want to believe that this is just a way to draw attention

24:48.800 --> 24:53.400
to the FSF and to try and get people to sign up so ultimately they can get some donations

24:53.400 --> 24:54.920
and keep going.

24:54.920 --> 25:00.400
You would kind of expect any other organization of this nature to try to take advantage of

25:00.400 --> 25:05.240
industry news to raise awareness to what they do I mean that might just be considered part

25:05.240 --> 25:06.240
of the business.

25:06.240 --> 25:10.920
I'll tell you what though if it ever happens I'll be the first to go on air and talk about

25:10.920 --> 25:16.320
it you know what I mean like could you imagine and also would it be good for Linux if Windows

25:16.320 --> 25:20.920
7 was open sourced and you could run Windows 7 and get it continued to be patched and fixed

25:20.920 --> 25:26.160
and improved would that be good for free software I guess?

25:26.160 --> 25:29.280
Well yeah because in of itself would be free software.

25:29.280 --> 25:35.260
For a single free software project yes it would be a software project that is free but

25:35.260 --> 25:40.180
the other free software out there may suffer I mean I don't I don't know if I actually

25:40.180 --> 25:45.160
want Windows 7 available to the community let's a lot of nice things have happened on

25:45.160 --> 25:48.440
the Linux desktop since Windows 7 and I wouldn't want to lose that.

25:48.440 --> 25:51.360
Well imagine how good this would be for the wine project.

25:51.360 --> 25:54.360
Yeah imagine how good it would be for all kinds of different individuals I mean for

25:54.360 --> 26:00.960
sure now I guess for overall for for humanity Joe it would be good and I'd give it a go
