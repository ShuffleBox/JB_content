00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,200
This is episode 89, recorded on January 20th, 2019.

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,200
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,200
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,200
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,400
It's good to be connected with you and let's kick things off with a story that just keeps

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,880
taking twist after turn after twist.

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,880
It's almost like a piece of fiction at this point.

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,680
It's the long twisted story of MongoDB and the bit of rejection it's getting from major

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,560
Linux distributions this week.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,020
Yeah, it all started when they changed their license to the server side public license,

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,000
the SSPL.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,300
And then last week we reported on Amazon rolling their own MongoDB compatible database called

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,040
DocumentDB, and now it's gone from bad to worse for MongoDB because it's being removed

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,760
from a few major distros.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,440
Yeah, so the ball really got rolling when both Fedora and Debian announced they would

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,640
no longer be including it in their distribution.

18
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,920
And the quote from Tom Calloway over at Fedora is this, it is the belief of Fedora that the

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,880
SSPL is intentionally crafted to be aggressively discriminatory towards a specific class of

20
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
users.

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,320
Well, it's not an open source license, is it?

22
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,600
So they can't have it in open source projects.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,360
Well, the MongoDB logic kind of goes like this.

24
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,680
This is a quote from their CTO and co-founder.

25
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,480
And Elliot explained, we believe that in today's world, linking has been superseded by the

26
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,800
provision of programs as services and the connection of programs over networks as the

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:52,120
main form of a program combination, where the GPL and all that, a lot of open source

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,920
licenses are really built around the idea of if you link to them.

29
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,560
But linking, they argue, is going away.

30
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,760
And re-hosting things and connecting to it over the network is the new normal.

31
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,280
He goes on to say, it is unclear whether existing copyleft licenses clearly apply to this form

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,120
of program combination.

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:14,320
And we intended the SSPL to be an option for developers to address this uncertainty.

34
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,220
Well, that is fair enough.

35
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,680
They do make a lot of good points.

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,860
But that doesn't change the fact that the way they've chosen to solve this problem is

37
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,440
by making a license that isn't open source.

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,740
And so these distros have no other choice but to remove it.

39
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,000
Talk about a rock and a hard place with MongoDB here, because they have the open source community

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,360
in the form of the distributions, essentially being forced to turn their backs on MongoDB.

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,980
And at the same time, on the commercial end of the spectrum, you've got companies like

42
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:51,040
Amazon launching DocumentDB, which gives a very compelling commercial alternative to

43
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,480
MongoDB.

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,200
It's a rough time to be that project right now and to be that company.

45
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:03,080
Well, except that you do have to ask, is anybody who's running a serious instance of MongoDB

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,520
really using the version in the repos of their distro, or are they using the MongoDB repos?

47
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,400
And realistically, that's probably the case with these major deployments.

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,280
So removing it from these distros isn't going to be a huge issue for a lot of the bigger

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,560
enterprise installations.

50
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,400
So maybe they're not that bothered, but I don't know, maybe it will hurt adoption in

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,400
the first place.

52
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,360
It seems like an opportunity for a snap package, Joe.

53
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
Yeah.

54
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,240
Well, we don't know whether it's going to actually be removed from Ubuntu yet, but it

55
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,760
sort of seems fairly likely that it will.

56
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,960
Although with the ZFS thing, they've put that in Ubuntu and got away with it, for want of

57
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
a better word.

58
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,960
True.

59
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,960
It's not in main Debian.

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,760
Well, much like Fedora pulling, it means it's getting pulled from RHEL.

61
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,080
It seems pretty likely that if it's getting pulled from the repository, it's probably

62
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,040
getting pulled from downstream Ubuntu.

63
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,640
But you're right, they have shown in the past, they're perfectly happy adding their own thing

64
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,080
and doing their own thing.

65
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,960
So it's possible it'll stick around.

66
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,240
Or they might use this opportunity to snap it up.

67
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,480
I mean, really, it does seem like a perfect opportunity.

68
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
Yeah.

69
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,860
And then it'll be available on multiple distros.

70
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,120
So you'd be able to get it relatively easily in Fedora, for example.

71
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,160
Well speaking of ZFS on Linux, there has been a lot of ups and downs recently.

72
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,580
So we covered all of the projects rebasing on the ZFS on Linux implementation.

73
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,200
That was huge news.

74
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,000
But then shortly after that, news came out that in the new 5.0 version of Linux, the

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,280
new kernel, the ZFS on Linux project could no longer build due to some kernel changes

76
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,040
that were made by the core developers.

77
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Yeah.

78
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,640
So we're getting short of hostility coming from Greg Kh regarding ZFS.

79
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
Hostility?

80
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
Yeah, okay.

81
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,280
I mean, definitely annoyance.

82
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,080
There was lines in there like, my tolerance for ZFS is pretty non-existent.

83
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,760
That's pretty straightforward.

84
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,280
He then later on followed up with, sorry, no, we do not keep symbols exported for non-in-kernel

85
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,280
users.

86
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,800
And then another kernel developer chimed in saying that people should go use FreeBSD if

87
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
they care about ZFS.

88
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,880
So there was some back and forth, yes.

89
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,960
I think really Greg's annoyance was at the end of the day, like Sun made it impossible

90
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,320
to run it on Linux intentionally.

91
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,040
They were trying to make it hard.

92
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,040
And so his position is, why am I bending over backwards to make a file system work?

93
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:31,220
Even he says, even if it's the best file system to ever grace this planet, that's fantastic.

94
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,200
But given that the creators of that code placed it under a license that was specifically designed

95
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,120
not to be compatible with Linux, to prevent it from ever being used on Linux, well, you

96
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,440
can see why I really don't care about it.

97
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
Why would I?

98
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
He writes.

99
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
So yeah.

100
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
Okay.

101
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
I mean, that's, yeah.

102
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,200
Yeah, I think that's a system thing.

103
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah, I suppose so.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,040
But there is a workaround, although it may possibly impact performance.

105
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,440
Well, essentially it just disables the vector instructions that were being used that got

106
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,920
taken away.

107
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,720
And that was to really just make checksumming faster.

108
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,640
So I suppose there's a possibility there'll be some performance hit there, but I'm not

109
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,640
sure.

110
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,640
It's not clear if it's only at build time.

111
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,080
I would not be surprised if we see some benchmarks soon that make it clear.

112
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,000
But at some point, either at the build process or perhaps when doing file system checksums,

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,280
there could be a performance hit.

114
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
We just don't know yet.

115
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,820
Well, I really hope there isn't a serious performance impact because we will never hear

116
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,260
the end of it from the BSD people.

117
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,260
Can you imagine?

118
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,720
It's based on Linux, but it runs best on FreeBSD.

119
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,400
Well, let's keep talking about the BSDs just for a moment here on the Linux Action News

120
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,480
program and talk about Project Trident, which just had their first stable release.

121
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,680
And for those of you that aren't keeping score at home, Project Trident is based on TrueOS.

122
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,080
And TrueOS itself, at least at the time of this release, was based on FreeBSD 13 Current.

123
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,600
So I managed to install this, but I didn't manage to boot it.

124
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,200
It looks from Twitter that you got on a bit better than I did.

125
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,200
Yeah, I did.

126
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,240
I've used it all morning, actually.

127
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,520
It's funny, I think what I said on Twitter was I went in with kind of low expectations

128
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,160
just because I was expecting it to be a really minimal, cute desktop that wasn't really ready

129
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
to go yet.

130
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:17,820
And this is their first stable release here, and TrueOS is kind of still new, and it's

131
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,160
all still kind of new.

132
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,280
And I went in with low expectations, and I got that sensation that I used to get from

133
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,320
distro hopping when I would move to a new distro that did things really differently

134
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,080
and it really impressed me.

135
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,840
I got that sensation.

136
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,080
And so I think it's very competitive for a particular type of workload.

137
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,480
It may still have some cooking it needs to do, but I was pretty impressed, Joe.

138
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:46,320
It's funny that it reminded you of a time many years ago because that was exactly the

139
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,320
feeling I got.

140
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,560
I didn't get as far as the desktop, but the whole experience around it felt like when

141
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,800
I first got into Linux, like 10, 11 years ago, from the download speed of the ISO, which

142
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,040
was somewhere around 200 kilobytes a second or whatever, it took hours and hours to download

143
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:04,280
this four point whatever gigabyte ISO.

144
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,320
And then the installer just felt very clunky and old school to me.

145
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,320
And then the fact that you go through the installation and then just won't boot.

146
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,960
And this is on the laptop that will run Trisco very happily.

147
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,400
It's just Intel, no Nvidia or anything like that.

148
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,600
So I was just not very impressed with it, really.

149
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:29,220
And I've had a bit of criticism, I think, for being down on BSD generally, or the BSDs.

150
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,320
And I don't think that's fair because things like FreeBSD clearly have a place and they

151
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,040
are excellent at some things, like basically all of the hardware that iX system sells,

152
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:42,280
for example, and network gear and Nasus and stuff.

153
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,120
It's absolutely perfect for that.

154
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,600
But in terms of the desktop, this Trident really, I think, shows how far behind Linux

155
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
they are.

156
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,080
It's really a shame you didn't get to go all the way to the desktop and use it for a bit

157
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,960
because I think some of my notes on here are very much like XFCE.

158
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,960
I think Joe would like this about it.

159
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,960
First of all, it has a Windows 7 sort of workflow look and feel.

160
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,480
And that's the first thing people said on Twitter, oh, I thought that was Windows 7

161
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
for a moment.

162
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
Yeah.

163
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
It's a little old.

164
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
It feels a little dated.

165
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
That might be fine for a workstation, though.

166
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,080
And it's got a few rough edges.

167
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,020
I've been on a VMware workstation kick, for better or for worse.

168
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,600
And so on my system, all of the bottom buttons of the installer get cut off.

169
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,160
I could just see the very, very, very, very top of the button.

170
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,480
And the first two buttons just shut the thing down to a command line.

171
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,920
It's like, all right, I'll try the other button.

172
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
Same exact result.

173
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,320
I had to just sit there and try the different buttons until I got the result I wanted.

174
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,160
So it took me a while to get through the installer.

175
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,540
But once I got it in, a couple of neat things stood out to me.

176
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,780
Number one, their file manager is kind of cool.

177
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,700
It's got built-in Git support.

178
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,560
So you can do Git check-ins and clone repos right in the file manager.

179
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,600
Pretty intelligently, they're using the LTS version of the Qt framework, version 5.12.0.

180
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,600
And the Qt-based desktop itself is very lean.

181
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,760
The Lumina desktop is fast.

182
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,000
It's easily configurable.

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,160
There is a control panel-like preferences area that has everything you'd want and not

184
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
too much.

185
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,500
And then, and I think maybe this just comes with all true OS-based systems, there's the

186
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:25,200
true OS sysadmin panel, which reminds me of Yast Lite.

187
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,680
It just does a few things, like manage volume snapshots and boot environments and set up

188
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,760
a few basic essentials about your computer, but that's it.

189
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,120
And last but not least, their update management tool ties in with those boot environments

190
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,960
and ZFS snapshots.

191
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,540
They're using ZFS in really clever ways that you don't even have to configure as an end

192
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,440
user to enable things like software rollbacks.

193
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,400
If your updates don't work, including the entire boot environment, so if the kernel

194
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,440
doesn't work or something gets borked with the boot manager, it can roll it back at a

195
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,340
file system level for you.

196
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,980
And it's just right there in the controls, you know, there's a mishmash of design looks

197
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,980
here and there.

198
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,720
And some things are a little odd, but everything's functional and it's, it performs great.

199
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,000
And I completely forgot that I was on a BSD-based system.

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,160
Oh, and it came with Telegram pre-installed.

201
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
So I was happy.

202
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,720
Telegram, right there, right there.

203
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,520
Oh, very nice, you're making me want to actually give this another go and try and get it working.

204
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,280
Because I've had a good experience with Ghost BSD before with the Mate desktop, but this

205
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,720
minimal Lumina desktop, I have tried not for a while.

206
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,000
So I would like to give that another go.

207
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,560
So all right, I'll try it on a different machine and see if I can get that to work.

208
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,060
Yeah, I think you might like it.

209
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:41,720
It's very XFCE in a lot of ways, but in just a very functional kind of way too.

210
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,840
And one other thing that's kind of nice is they have the AppCafe, which is a sort of

211
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,860
Synaptic-like GUI package manager.

212
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,020
And I could install things like Mumble and the Fish Shell in seconds.

213
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,680
Just I typed in Mumble, hit enter, showed up, installed it and downloaded all the Qt

214
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,720
4 dependencies required and everything loaded perfectly fine.

215
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,040
Same with the Fish Shell in seconds.

216
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,600
Are you really selling this to me?

217
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,760
Because Synaptic-like is how I want all my GUI software managers to be.

218
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,680
Yeah, it was peak package management software, I think.

219
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,040
Yeah, exactly, before all the bloat and everything.

220
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,440
All right, I'm definitely gonna have to give this a go then.

221
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,880
Well, if you want something really different, Android x86 has a pretty significant release

222
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
this week.

223
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,160
It's 8.1 R1, and there's several things in this that actually make it, I would say, ready

224
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
for the desktop.

225
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,560
I know it always kind of has been getting closer and closer, but now there's like things

226
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,760
like a proper taskbar and all that stuff.

227
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,560
Yeah, I've been following the development of this, and this is based on Android 8.1

228
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,920
Oreo, so it is one version behind.

229
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,280
But then most phones are, it's hard Android development.

230
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,860
You can't really criticize them too much for it.

231
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,500
And I've got a touchscreen laptop, a little 11-inch VivoBook, and that's what I always

232
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
test this on.

233
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,980
And again, as usual, worked perfectly on there.

234
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,320
And you've got that choice between either a touch-based interface like standard Android

235
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,200
or more of a traditional desktop interface with a taskbar and menu and everything that's

236
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
more mouse-based.

237
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,500
And also, worth noting, Joe, freeform window modes.

238
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,680
You can drag windows around.

239
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
They're not all full screen, too.

240
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,920
Yeah, so it really is a desktop-like experience.

241
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,840
Why you'd want to do that, I don't know.

242
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,080
It's just something of a curiosity, really, to me.

243
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:35,360
Surely no one can be actually using this as their daily machine.

244
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,240
Maybe for like a kiosk or appliance.

245
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,280
Maybe it's like in a business where you want people to fill out information when they come

246
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
in.

247
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
I don't know.

248
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,560
I'm just trying to think how I use this.

249
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
I like it.

250
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,800
I like messing around with it.

251
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,360
I use it for about a good solid couple of hours every release.

252
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,880
And I'm like, OK, good enough.

253
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,200
But I actually couldn't get this one to boot.

254
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Maybe it's VMware Workstation.

255
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,120
I was trying everything out in VMware Workstation.

256
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,720
So maybe that's the issue.

257
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,920
So I didn't actually get to try it.

258
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,520
Did you get it to boot and try it?

259
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,320
Yeah, yeah, I booted it on hardware on this VivoBook, yeah.

260
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,440
Surely with all the laptops you've got lying around, I suppose you're on the road at the

261
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
moment.

262
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
Yeah, that's the thing.

263
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
I'm on the road.

264
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,440
So I got limited hardware.

265
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
So I was trying virtualization.

266
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
Yeah.

267
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
I don't know.

268
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,920
I'm somewhat tempted to put this on the VivoBook because I don't really have that much use

269
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,840
for that machine anymore because I recently bought a new laptop.

270
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,160
And so it's kind of a bit redundant.

271
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,560
And it would be nice, I suppose, to have essentially a large tablet with a keyboard.

272
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,280
So maybe I'll give it a go.

273
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,360
Yeah, I could see it on an x86-based tablet.

274
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,400
And maybe it's one of the several OSs I have on there, especially if you can have a GApps

275
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
equivalent.

276
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,320
And now I can get the Netflix app, and I can download videos for offline watching.

277
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,120
Now I'm starting to see a use case here.

278
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,400
But it's pretty backwoods.

279
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,180
I don't really know how many users are interested.

280
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,180
Maybe it's software development.

281
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,180
Maybe that's what it is.

282
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,180
Maybe it's for developers, Joe.

283
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,840
Maybe it's for people to develop Android software on big, fast computers.

284
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,400
Maybe in testing and things.

285
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,320
It does have the Play Store pre-installed.

286
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,640
So you can get things like Netflix.

287
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,200
I didn't actually try Netflix, but I assume you can get that.

288
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,160
You can certainly get most of the apps that I looked for.

289
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,440
I'd be surprised if it works.

290
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,360
There's probably some DRM thing in there that kicks in.

291
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
Yeah.

292
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
I'm going to have to try that then.

293
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,200
I kind of like talking about the other end of these releases, though, like post-market

294
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,200
OS.

295
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:31,480
Yeah, which is, as the name suggests, an aftermarket firmware for primarily phones, but some boards.

296
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,640
And the idea of it is that you'll get 10 years of support with it.

297
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,080
And it's not going to be based on Android.

298
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:44,260
It's going to be aiming for at least mainline kernels and very long-term support for devices

299
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,920
that otherwise have been completely abandoned by the original OEM.

300
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,920
Yeah.

301
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,920
And it looks like most of the user space Linux stuff is Alpine Linux right now.

302
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,840
In fact, one of the things they're working on is they've been based on the development

303
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:59,480
branch of Alpine Linux, which was good while they're developing software.

304
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,380
But I meant about once a month, everything would break in post-market OS.

305
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:09,940
And they have been spending a lot of time just integrating Alpine Linux updates without

306
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,540
really iterating on the operating system itself.

307
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,240
So to avoid substantial breakage, as they put it, they are rebasing on the Alpine stable

308
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,120
releases in the future.

309
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,840
And then they will have a package branch, which is based on the next Alpine release,

310
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,600
which is every six months or so.

311
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,120
Essentially, they're just going to match Alpine's release cadence.

312
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,640
But it's still very early days for this.

313
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,560
It's nowhere near something like Ubuntu Touch, for example, in terms of actual usability.

314
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Yeah.

315
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,080
So for example, like the Nexus 5, they have a booting mainline kernel.

316
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,280
They've got accelerated graphics.

317
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,320
That's huge.

318
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,020
And they can actually communicate with the cellular modem.

319
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,920
But there's no working audio.

320
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,920
There's no calls happening.

321
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,960
I mean, it's really early days.

322
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,240
And there's hundreds of devices that they currently support at various levels like that.

323
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,760
In this update, they're adding a bunch of other devices, including some cool tablet

324
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,980
devices and some other ARM-based devices.

325
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,360
But it's all various levels of support.

326
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,320
And they're trying to get some basic goalposts in there, like get cell calls working and

327
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,320
things like that.

328
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,400
But so far, they haven't gotten there.

329
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,240
I do like their honest approach, though.

330
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,200
If you go to postmarketos.org, right there, the first thing you see is alpha version,

331
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,300
calls don't work, et cetera, only suitable for hackers.

332
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,560
So they're not trying to make any claims beyond that, which is good.

333
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:39,880
But it does show how hard this is to make a proper Linux system work on ARM.

334
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Right.

335
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,040
But flip this around for a moment, Joe, on its head, and look at the Nexus 5.

336
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,760
That's been completely abandoned by the original creator.

337
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,480
There's zero support now from Google for the Nexus 5.

338
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,560
At least Post Market OS supports it to some degree.

339
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,120
So you could make the argument that they're supporting it better than the original creator.

340
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,780
The thing is with projects like this, too, is they have time.

341
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,800
They have time to work this out.

342
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,960
There's not a huge commercial product that they have to get to market and they don't

343
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,000
have to sell millions of copies of to be sustainable.

344
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,440
It really is an open source project that can take its time to build something and eventually

345
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,680
become something that can keep these devices going.

346
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,600
And if they only get to maybe, say, a dozen or so that are fully supported, well, then

347
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,120
they're better off than they would have been.

348
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
Yeah, that's true.

349
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,600
And you mentioned the Nexus 5 there.

350
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,840
Of course, you can run lineage on that.

351
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,080
But all the kernel and drivers and everything are seriously out of date and a potential

352
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:39,400
security risk, whereas the whole point of Post Market OS is to be up to date and secure.

353
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,080
And I suppose that is a good priority to have if you use that as a foundation.

354
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,200
And then once they get it up to a point where it is working really well with an interface

355
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,160
like Plasma Mobile, for example, then you'll have something that's actually really worth

356
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,560
using in the long term.

357
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:59,080
Did you see in this update, they also talk about getting XFCE 4 running on the Librem

358
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,360
5 dev kit board?

359
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,680
Yeah, I did see that and it warmed my heart to see XFCE running there, although in the

360
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,800
photo that's in this post, you have to scroll down a little way to see it.

361
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,160
If you expand that photo, you see something quite alarming, and that is a fan attached

362
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,200
to this Librem 5 dev kit.

363
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,480
Whoa, holy rotations, Batman.

364
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,360
That is that it looks also like it's been wired on there.

365
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,720
Perhaps they wired it.

366
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Maybe they had to overclock it.

367
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:32,240
Let's give the benefit of the doubt here because this first of all, this dev board is large.

368
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,920
It's like four or five raspberry pies next to each other large.

369
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,920
It's big.

370
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,520
And there is a, what would you call that, a 40 millimeter fan.

371
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,000
It's a pretty small fan, might even be 20.

372
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,360
It's one of those real high pitched whiners.

373
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,640
And it has been suspended with stiff wire over the CPU heat sink in what appears to

374
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,400
be a desperate attempt to cool the CPU on the dev board.

375
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,480
You know, Joe, though, I got to say, looking at the screenshot here, they have the info

376
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,600
up on the screen and the CPU is running at 1.5 gigahertz, which double checked me, but

377
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,880
I think that's the clock speed it's supposed to be running at.

378
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,160
Yeah, I think that is stock.

379
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,360
So yeah, it's not even overclocked.

380
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,020
That is very alarming then.

381
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:18,760
Could it be that PureOS will be more efficient somehow?

382
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,080
And maybe that's something that I don't know post market need to work on.

383
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,400
I would say this, if you want to know what we're talking about, go to linuxactionnews.com

384
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,440
slash 89 and then go to the post market OS link, scroll down this post and look at this

385
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,560
photo of the XFCE desktop and then let us know what you think.

386
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,680
Linuxactionnews.com slash contact, legitimately, if I didn't know any better, I'd say this

387
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,960
is a really bad sign, but you know, this could be anything.

388
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
It could be anything.

389
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,960
So we'd love to have somebody talk us off the cliff.

390
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,360
Yeah, well, I'm hoping to speak to Todd at some point soon, the CEO of Todd Weaver of

391
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,080
PureOSM because we agreed a hot date on Valentine's Day.

392
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,080
It's true.

393
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
That's true.

394
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,020
Oh, by the way, just one more thing on the post market OS.

395
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:10,960
They also got Unity 8 working on top of post market, which is just, I don't know.

396
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,320
They say it runs great.

397
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,560
I'm sure it does.

398
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:20,800
It's a pretty neat project and I love the idea of it's Alpine based.

399
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,080
It's not necessarily like some clone of Android that they're trying to flash onto these phones,

400
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,040
which may actually be a lot easier.

401
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:32,260
It is its own unique thing that they're trying to breathe 10 years of life into a device

402
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,720
after it's been abandoned by a manufacturer.

403
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,920
And if they can even get that for a handful of devices, I think it's going to be a project

404
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
that is cherished.

405
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,880
Well, a project that was cherished by some people was the Firefox test pilot program,

406
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,960
which Mozilla have decided is no more.

407
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,780
I read this post, Joe, and I feel like if you're a student going into business communications,

408
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:02,360
you should go read this because it is a masterpiece in reframing failure as an epic success.

409
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,480
I'll give you a couple of quick choice quotes here because keep in mind, test pilot was

410
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,760
starting to get a bad name for a lot of, well, most people consider it an advertising mechanism,

411
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,320
fair or not.

412
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,440
And so it was time to get to get far, far away from it.

413
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
But this is how it's framed.

414
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,640
They say, we're proud to announce today that we're evolving our approach to experimentation

415
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,480
even further.

416
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,720
Test pilot was designed to harness the energy of our most passionate users.

417
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,120
Test pilot performed better than we could have ever imagined.

418
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,680
As a result of this program, we're now in a stronger position.

419
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,900
So today, we are announcing that we will be moving to a new structure that will demonstrate

420
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,840
our ability to innovate in exciting ways.

421
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,040
As a result, we're closing the test pilot program as we've known it.

422
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:55,880
Because it's such a success, Joe, it's been so incredibly blow the doors off successful,

423
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
we're ending it.

424
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,680
Well, to be fair, they do say now that everyone is responsible for maintaining the culture

425
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,800
of experimentation capitalized, Firefox has developed through this process.

426
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,520
So they're basically saying that instead of just having this small test pilot program,

427
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,640
now all the experiments will be part of Firefox.

428
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,640
Yeah.

429
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,640
And it sounds like it's actually a realignment inside Mozilla too, because here's the wording

430
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
you're going off.

431
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,360
You say, migrating to a new model doesn't mean we're doing fewer experiments.

432
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,440
In fact, we're doing even more with an exclamation mark.

433
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:36,440
The innovation process that led to products like Firefox Monitor are no longer the responsibility

434
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,840
of a handful of individuals, but rather the entire organization.

435
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,680
So read that as there was just a team that was responsible for test pilot and tried a

436
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:53,400
few things, and now we're just making that a company wide thing or a group wide thing.

437
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,400
So you're right, it's not only going to be a change in how Firefox delivers these features,

438
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,200
but it's going to be a structural change inside the Mozilla group too.

439
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,640
It just seems like a bad idea to me.

440
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,480
It was a great idea before that you could opt in to this program where you get these

441
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,360
new features, and you could test them out and help out the project with it.

442
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:20,360
They weren't inflicting these potentially bad features onto the entire user base.

443
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,640
And okay, they can do it with sort of staged rollouts and stuff, but it just seemed like

444
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,560
that was a great idea before.

445
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:31,460
And to get rid of it and move to a culture of experimentation just doesn't seem right

446
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,460
to me.

447
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,460
Yeah.

448
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,240
I mean, I got to assume they're going to do some sort of staged rollout.

449
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,800
They don't outline that in here, but I think it's safe to say the test pilot program caught

450
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,000
a few bad ideas before they rolled out to everybody.

451
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
And that's valuable.

452
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,760
I hope they do something like that.

453
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,940
It would be wise to do that, and I would imagine they're going to.

454
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
But you're right.

455
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:55,040
To me, it seems like it's extremely precarious times for Firefox with the changes coming

456
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:03,720
to Microsoft Edge and the total dominance that WebKit and Blink now seem to be approaching.

457
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Firefox is in a bad position, and all of this, from the way they communicate it to the things

458
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,000
that they do, they're not making a compelling case.

459
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,200
And there's so many basics that they still get wrong on the different operating systems

460
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,400
on Windows, on Linux, and on Mac OS.

461
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,440
They failed to fully integrate with those host operating systems in a way that it makes

462
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,000
Firefox often the third browser for a lot of people.

463
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,900
And that's a really bad position.

464
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,800
I think they're really screwed because the way they communicate is so screwed.

465
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,720
It doesn't connect with any of us anymore.

466
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,240
They've completely lost us in the message.

467
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:53,240
And their priorities are so big, and their goals are so lofty, and their market share

468
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,960
is so small, and it just seems to be getting smaller.

469
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,340
I feel like it is essentially end of days for Firefox, unless people actively start

470
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,160
making a choice to run this browser.

471
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:10,480
I'm using it right now to do this show, but I can't make a difference alone.

472
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,800
And a handful of Linux users aren't going to make a difference either.

473
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,320
It has to be on the commercial platforms, and that's just not happening.

474
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,040
Man, you paint a very bleak picture for someone who's sitting here staring at Firefox right

475
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,040
now.

476
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:26,520
I really hope that they can turn it around, because I'd like it as a browser.

477
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:31,400
I prefer to use a completely open source, free software browser.

478
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,140
And I don't want to have to use Chrome, or even Chromium, really.

479
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:42,000
I've used Firefox for years and years and years, and I just want to keep using it.

480
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
So I really hope you're wrong.

481
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,800
I do too, because, in fact, I hope I'm really wrong, because it's not just they need to

482
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
survive.

483
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,720
They need to have a measurable, important percentage of the market, so that way they

484
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,360
have a real seat at the table.

485
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,320
They have power and leverage in the conversation about web standards.

486
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,500
And they don't have that if they don't have a sizable market share.

487
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,440
So it's not just like they have to be surviving.

488
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,840
They have to be thriving to really be successful.

489
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:15,260
I think maybe I'm losing faith in the side of Mozilla that doesn't necessarily have its

490
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,840
hands on the code as much.

491
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,840
I don't know.

492
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,580
You just look at all the stories we've covered.

493
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,060
But hopefully I'm wrong.

494
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,060
Time will tell, Joe.

495
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:27,200
Well, at least they're killing Adobe Flash support in the upcoming Firefox 69.

496
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,640
It's funny that you have to say Adobe Flash now.

497
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,360
That's how irrelevant it is.

498
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,920
You have to kind of specify which Flash you're talking about.

499
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
I guess so.

500
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:40,940
I mean, it feels like this has been a slow-moving development.

501
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,560
But the announcement from Adobe itself was back in 2017 that it planned to push Flash

502
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,540
into an end-of-life state.

503
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:54,040
So there's sort of been this 2017 announcement with a 2020 roadmap objective for Adobe.

504
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,680
And so this is actually right in step with that.

505
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,000
In fact, they're even coming in a little early.

506
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,040
Firefox 69 is scheduled to be released on September 9th.

507
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,240
So if you are in a corporation using Firefox where Flash is still relevant, I know that's

508
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,040
also in education.

509
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:14,240
For example, my kids' schools, Firefox on the machines, and they're using Flash apps.

510
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,240
Flash apps, Joe.

511
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,960
So they're going to have to brace themselves for this change.

512
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,280
And it'll be on September 9th that Firefox 69 ships on time.

513
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,020
Well, it's not just with Firefox.

514
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,400
It's happening with Chrome as well.

515
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,520
Flash is just on its way out.

516
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,480
So institutions like your kids' school that are using Flash, this is just going to force

517
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,480
their hand.

518
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,520
It's going to have to go another route, and it's going to end up costing a lot of money

519
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:39,440
probably to develop these apps and games and educational games and stuff.

520
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,040
So is the world, though, of software, Joe.

521
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,040
In fact, it's a reason why schools should be using open-source software.

522
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Let's be honest.

523
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:48,480
This is where free software is extremely strong, especially in the education sector.

524
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,560
And I'll note it's not just Flash, a lot of great plugins.

525
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,840
The whole Netscape API for plugins is being deprecated.

526
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,880
And it's just time to go.

527
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,880
It's old.

528
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,880
It's insecure.

529
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,760
And this has been a massive transition for Firefox to make.

530
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:10,720
And in the day and age of HTML5 and everything we've got now with web apps and WebAssembly,

531
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,720
there's no excuse.

532
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,120
Just switch to something else.

533
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,680
And if you're going to switch, a little bit of Linux Action News advice, switch to free

534
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
software.

535
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Here's a tagline, Joe.

536
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,680
This is from Linux Action News.

537
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,680
Everybody out there can take it.

538
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,800
It's all free to the community.

539
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,560
The tagline is this.

540
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:27,240
You migrate to free software, and you only have to migrate once.

541
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
Boom.

542
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,240
The sales write themselves.

543
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
Yeah.

544
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,240
Let's stick it on a t-shirt.

545
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,240
I like that idea.

546
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,880
You should do that real quick, Joe, before we publish this.

547
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,480
Or if somebody out there does that, just give us a cut.

548
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,560
In the meantime, if you've been listening for quite a while, you know the drill.
