Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.160 --> 00:20.320
This is episode 40, recorded on February 11th, 2018.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.320
I'm Chris.

00:21.320 --> 00:22.320
And I'm Joe.

00:22.320 --> 00:23.320
Hello, Joe.

00:23.320 --> 00:26.720
It's good to be connected with you, and it's great to start the week off with some really

00:26.720 --> 00:27.720
good news.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.480
We have a whole batch of new open source project releases.

00:31.480 --> 00:33.400
And let's start with the Mate desktop.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.580
Yeah, Mate 1.20.

00:35.580 --> 00:41.460
And this is a pretty huge release for them, because it finally gets high DPI sorted out.

00:41.460 --> 00:45.920
This desktop, it's all about the traditional paradigm, is going to have one of the first

00:45.920 --> 00:47.720
class implementations of high DPI.

00:47.720 --> 00:53.740
I mean, we're talking auto detection, hinting for cute applications, so they also automatically

00:53.740 --> 00:55.520
scale up.

00:55.520 --> 00:59.920
Even the login screen supports high DPI and automatically detects it.

00:59.920 --> 01:03.560
And this is going to be available in Ubuntu Mate 1804, isn't it?

01:03.560 --> 01:04.560
Right.

01:04.560 --> 01:09.960
So it's going to be part of Mate 1.20, which will ship in Ubuntu Mate 1804.

01:09.960 --> 01:13.800
And it's one of these features, because they've done it so well, you won't even notice, because

01:13.800 --> 01:15.200
you won't have to do anything.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.640
Your desktop will just look right.

01:16.640 --> 01:22.680
I must say, it's very appealing to me now, as someone who's been stuck on XFCE, I'll

01:22.680 --> 01:29.560
probably be on XFCE again for Ubuntu 1804, so I'll be on Xubuntu for that.

01:29.560 --> 01:35.680
But looking at the way Mate has really developed, it's looking really good.

01:35.680 --> 01:39.640
And it feels like a really solid backup plan for me at this point.

01:39.640 --> 01:43.520
So Martin Wimpress joined me on last week's Linux Unplugged.

01:43.520 --> 01:48.840
And he really laid out the two year journey that the Mate project has been on to get the

01:48.840 --> 01:49.960
desktop here.

01:49.960 --> 01:53.760
And it's incredible work that's gone here, because it's involved bringing the desktop

01:53.760 --> 01:59.720
up to GTK 3, getting the themes and artwork ready, working across multiple projects to

01:59.720 --> 02:01.720
get all of this stuff tied together.

02:01.720 --> 02:04.740
And this is just really scratching the surface of Mate 1.20.

02:04.740 --> 02:07.040
There's tons of other really great features in there.

02:07.040 --> 02:12.520
Yeah, significant improvements to window tiling with drag to quadrant, which is useful.

02:12.520 --> 02:18.640
And I think another huge one is the global menu support, which they've been working on

02:18.640 --> 02:21.960
for a while, but now seems to be fully baked into it.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.920
So I know that X Unity users are going to be grateful for that one.

02:24.920 --> 02:30.000
I think the Mate project very cleverly has been sneaking improvements in there to entice

02:30.000 --> 02:34.880
Unity users that are looking for a new GTK home.

02:34.880 --> 02:39.380
And specifically, the Ubuntu Mate project has brought a lot of that all together.

02:39.380 --> 02:42.680
But speaking of support for global menus, and perhaps a totally different desktop for

02:42.680 --> 02:49.120
some of those Unity users like me, Plasma has a new release, version 5.12, which also

02:49.120 --> 02:51.760
happens to be a long term support.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.760
And I'm using it right now as we do this show.

02:53.760 --> 02:57.560
Yeah, I've heard you gushing about this on Linux Unplugged.

02:57.560 --> 03:01.720
So here we are several days later, are you still as happy with it as you were?

03:01.720 --> 03:02.760
Happier, yeah.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.160
So I've upgraded all of my machines now to 5.12.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.480
I've been using KDE Neon User Edition.

03:08.480 --> 03:13.080
It's one of those upgrades really where if you didn't know it was happening, you almost

03:13.080 --> 03:15.760
would have noticed nothing, just a couple of things got better.

03:15.760 --> 03:19.820
Probably my favorite thing I noticed right away is I can now highlight the notification

03:19.820 --> 03:25.480
text when notifications come up, which that system in itself has gotten really good in

03:25.480 --> 03:27.760
the last few Plasma desktop releases.

03:27.760 --> 03:31.080
I'm really picky about notifications, and I have that thing dialed in.

03:31.080 --> 03:34.720
And so when things come up and I can highlight text from it, love it.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.080
It was one of those features I just stumbled across.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.480
It was intuitive.

03:38.480 --> 03:41.800
It was the kind of thing that thrills you when you run into it.

03:41.800 --> 03:47.040
And another big one is night color, which now works on Wayland doing the same job that

03:47.040 --> 03:52.640
Redshift does with X, which makes the screen kind of have a more reddy tint at night and

03:52.640 --> 03:56.220
a bluey tint in the morning, which I know a lot of people use.

03:56.220 --> 03:59.640
So that's really good to see that they're pushing this Wayland stuff forward.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.800
And it's not just that, is it?

04:00.800 --> 04:03.520
I mean, they really are concentrating on Wayland now.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.120
I use that feature, love it, have not tried it on Plasma yet.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.160
I really recommend it.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.880
If your phone supports that or your desktop supports it, Gnome desktop supports this as

04:10.880 --> 04:11.880
well.

04:11.880 --> 04:13.820
Or like Joe said, you could install Redshift.

04:13.820 --> 04:14.820
Try that out.

04:14.820 --> 04:21.000
But yeah, so this is an interesting feature because they're touting it as a Wayland exclusive.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.960
Welcome to our new Wayland reality, everybody, where now we have features that you only get

04:26.960 --> 04:28.520
when you use Wayland.

04:28.520 --> 04:29.520
And it makes sense.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.800
I understand why when you're implementing something like this.

04:31.800 --> 04:32.800
I like it actually.

04:32.800 --> 04:36.520
You know, in a way I kind of wish Plasma would get worse and worse rather than better and

04:36.520 --> 04:41.520
better because I'm inevitably going to have to switch away from XFC at some point, I think.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.160
The development is just too slow.

04:43.160 --> 04:46.400
It's not going to catch up with GTK3 and Wayland.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.600
I'd love to be proven wrong on that because I really want to stay on it.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.800
But my backup plan has always been Marte, right?

04:52.800 --> 04:58.500
But now looking at Plasma, it seems like it's got equally as much to offer and I just feel

04:58.500 --> 04:59.500
so conflicted.

04:59.500 --> 05:04.720
If I'm going to make a change, yeah, I could try one or the other, but I just can't see

05:04.720 --> 05:11.360
myself picking between them because they seem to be in different ways just great desktops.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.920
Well let me tell you two things.

05:12.920 --> 05:18.640
Number one is this Wayland support that they're baking in now is officially in an LTS release,

05:18.640 --> 05:21.680
which means they're going to be working and improving this for years.

05:21.680 --> 05:25.380
That's going to make their Wayland support top notch just in itself.

05:25.380 --> 05:30.440
But the second thing, podcaster to podcaster, there is a feature that I love.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.880
You know when you're doing a show and all of a sudden one of your applications or a

05:33.880 --> 05:38.320
tab in your browser just goes crazy and starts playing music or starts making noise?

05:38.320 --> 05:39.320
Yep.

05:39.320 --> 05:40.320
I know that nightmare scenario.

05:40.320 --> 05:44.600
Well, one of the great things in Plasma Desktop now is applications that are currently playing

05:44.600 --> 05:49.240
audio are now marked with a little speaker icon down in the task manager and you can

05:49.240 --> 05:53.440
right click on it, just like in modern browsers tabs, you can right click on it and mute the

05:53.440 --> 05:55.400
entire application from the task manager.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.000
Boom, kill it.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Nice.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.640
That's a feature I'd love to have on Xfce, yeah.

06:00.640 --> 06:03.360
But it's not just desktops getting major releases this week, is it?

06:03.360 --> 06:06.200
There's also VLC, which is 3.0.0.

06:06.200 --> 06:09.480
A huge release of VLC this week.

06:09.480 --> 06:12.760
Let's just go down some of my favorite features right off the top of my head.

06:12.760 --> 06:14.720
We now have Chromecast support built in.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.720
If you've got one of those, that's pretty handy.

06:17.720 --> 06:22.240
But the number one feature for me, now that I'm coincidentally on the Plasma desktop,

06:22.240 --> 06:28.080
it supports playing files from over network shares, like an SMB share.

06:28.080 --> 06:32.240
So GNOME users, when you would browse your network and you double click on a Samba share

06:32.240 --> 06:38.940
that maybe has your files in it, in the background, GNOME uses GVFS to mount that to your local

06:38.940 --> 06:43.000
file system and then applications just think they're browsing a folder way deep in your

06:43.000 --> 06:45.440
home directory and they launch the file.

06:45.440 --> 06:49.280
But on the Plasma desktop, there's this whole KIO and KO slave system where it's making

06:49.280 --> 06:52.880
a remote connection to the server and it's aware that it's a remote connection and it

06:52.880 --> 06:57.120
doesn't do this back end kind of sneaky file system mount.

06:57.120 --> 07:01.160
And applications had to be aware of this KIO system, this communication layer.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.000
I'm probably getting some of this wrong, but my rough understanding is applications had

07:04.000 --> 07:06.560
to write support for it, like maybe Dragon Player.

07:06.560 --> 07:11.740
But applications like VLC, if you tried to play a large movie file over network share,

07:11.740 --> 07:15.680
in the background, the Plasma desktop would begin transferring that file.

07:15.680 --> 07:19.880
So in my case, maybe like a 20 gigabyte file would start transferring in the background,

07:19.880 --> 07:23.760
filling up the SSD on my laptop, and then once that transfer is complete, would then

07:23.760 --> 07:25.000
launch VLC.

07:25.000 --> 07:32.400
Now it can pass along the SMB path right to VLC, VLC is SMB aware, also FTP, SFTP, and

07:32.400 --> 07:33.400
others.

07:33.400 --> 07:37.440
It'll fire the file right up, no transfer required, streams it over the network.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.440
Hallelujah.

07:38.440 --> 07:43.240
So you're telling me that video LAN player can now play videos over the LAN?

07:43.240 --> 07:44.240
Yeah, yeah.

07:44.240 --> 07:47.720
VLC also now uses OpenGL and Linux for smooth 4K playback.

07:47.720 --> 07:50.760
That's another problem I've had trying to play my drone footage on Linux.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.760
These are two huge features for Chris personally.

07:53.760 --> 07:59.280
Yeah, and hardware decoding by default for 8K playback as well.

07:59.280 --> 08:05.480
And supporting 10-bit HDR and 3D video, they've really upped the game with this release.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.880
This is also an LTS release, so that's interesting.

08:08.880 --> 08:14.240
And this version of VLC now supports adaptive streaming, also known as Dash, which could

08:14.240 --> 08:19.000
make pulling in live streams in VLC a lot smoother of experience with less buffer, less

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
delay.

08:20.000 --> 08:24.520
You know, I've pretty much switched over to GNOME MPV player, but this is tempting me

08:24.520 --> 08:25.600
back now.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.080
This is sounding really good, this release of VLC.

08:28.080 --> 08:33.420
I've been really enjoying Dragon Player on the Plasma desktop, but I will admit I snap

08:33.420 --> 08:37.440
installed VLC because that was the fastest way I could get version 3.0.

08:37.440 --> 08:41.840
And I've been using it all morning, and I'm really liking the new features.

08:41.840 --> 08:45.280
It's funny, I find myself installing things that way myself now.

08:45.280 --> 08:48.600
That's the first port of call that's checked, is there a snap available, because you know

08:48.600 --> 08:51.680
it's pretty much going to be the latest version.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.360
And also, it's got the advantage that you can have different versions installed at the

08:54.360 --> 08:55.360
same time.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.360
Yeah, exactly.

08:56.360 --> 09:02.360
I did an AB of version 2.2 or whatever it is and 3.0, 3.0 via the snap and the standard

09:02.360 --> 09:06.600
version that we've all had now for a while via the distros repo, and was able to verify

09:06.600 --> 09:09.740
that yeah, version 3.0 can do the Samba playback.

09:09.740 --> 09:11.020
These things do work better.

09:11.020 --> 09:12.020
It's kind of great.

09:12.020 --> 09:16.200
Now, I also have both of them installed, and they're not really differentiated in my launcher,

09:16.200 --> 09:17.440
but I can navigate that.

09:17.440 --> 09:18.440
It was intentional.

09:18.440 --> 09:21.920
Yeah, and something I would definitely install with a snap is Nextcloud 13.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.740
Yeah, version 13 final.

09:23.740 --> 09:28.060
We talked about the beta weeks ago, specifically around the video and text chat, but now it's

09:28.060 --> 09:35.000
shipped in version 13 as well as a new improved UI, end-to-end encryption, improved performance,

09:35.000 --> 09:39.040
and specifically a focus on improved communication with LDAP.

09:39.040 --> 09:44.080
Yeah, there's a lot of good features on paper, but I still don't find myself using it.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.080
I don't know why.

09:45.080 --> 09:50.360
I just feel that even after 13 versions now, it still can't compete with the likes of Google

09:50.360 --> 09:51.360
Drive really.

09:51.360 --> 09:54.840
You know, Joe, there's a quote from Frank in the release notes here, Frank who runs

09:54.840 --> 10:00.440
Nextcloud, and it kind of helps frame the project's goals for me.

10:00.440 --> 10:06.080
He says, our forward-looking development strategy is the reason behind our meteoric rise in

10:06.080 --> 10:07.080
the market.

10:07.080 --> 10:11.480
With a laser-sharp focus on enabling modern employees to be productive while keeping IT

10:11.480 --> 10:16.300
in control over the data they've worked on, Nextcloud will continue to push the boundaries

10:16.300 --> 10:21.400
of what a secure, self-hosted file exchange and collaboration platform offers.

10:21.400 --> 10:24.000
There's a couple of key points that I take away from that.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.880
Number one key point is Nextcloud's primary feature is you own the data.

10:27.880 --> 10:28.980
It's on-premises.

10:28.980 --> 10:30.400
You have complete control over it.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.080
That's feature number one.

10:32.080 --> 10:36.400
Feature number two is they're moving this platform forward at a breakneck pace, adding

10:36.400 --> 10:40.960
features that you would otherwise have to pay for from much larger commercial platforms.

10:40.960 --> 10:44.980
And if you only need components of them, they're trying to get them built into Nextcloud as

10:44.980 --> 10:46.820
fast as possible.

10:46.820 --> 10:52.400
What I don't hear in there are terms like platform stability or long-term stability

10:52.400 --> 10:53.400
goals.

10:53.400 --> 10:54.400
It's just not where they're at yet.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.480
Right now, they're in the grow and add feature phase.

10:56.480 --> 10:57.480
Yeah.

10:57.480 --> 11:01.960
I mean, the first point is great and being on-premises, being in complete control of

11:01.960 --> 11:05.240
your data, that is what we all want.

11:05.240 --> 11:10.560
But as you say, there's not any stability there and okay, maybe they're going to work

11:10.560 --> 11:11.560
towards that.

11:11.560 --> 11:17.400
But until they have that, I just can't see myself deploying it in production anywhere.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.880
It's just testing for me at this stage.

11:18.880 --> 11:25.560
I feel that even here we are 13 versions in, it's still something that I'm testing and

11:25.560 --> 11:29.080
evaluating and I'm not comfortable putting into production.

11:29.080 --> 11:33.080
I mean, I could just about run it myself, but I definitely wouldn't put it into production

11:33.080 --> 11:36.360
for other people because I just don't think it's ready yet.

11:36.360 --> 11:39.720
Which is a real shame because it's probably the best we have.

11:39.720 --> 11:41.800
I know that Noah likes C file, doesn't he?

11:41.800 --> 11:45.480
Which I've tried and that's good and we've got PDO as well, but they don't offer the

11:45.480 --> 11:47.800
same feature set as Nextcloud.

11:47.800 --> 11:51.300
But maybe they're just too many features in Nextcloud and they should concentrate more

11:51.300 --> 11:56.120
on the core functionality and get that 100% rock solid before they start doing things

11:56.120 --> 11:58.960
like this video calling and all of that stuff.

11:58.960 --> 12:03.680
Well, I would flip it around for consideration and say that perhaps the core core functionality

12:03.680 --> 12:11.480
is not file sync, but collaboration, calendars, contacts, that sort of stuff, notes, photos,

12:11.480 --> 12:16.160
documents, that support syncing that stuff to your local file system.

12:16.160 --> 12:19.720
So it's sort of a reverse of I think what it is, it's just they're not in alignment

12:19.720 --> 12:21.480
with what your priorities are.

12:21.480 --> 12:25.600
Well you could certainly spin it that way, yeah, okay, let's give them the benefit of

12:25.600 --> 12:26.600
the doubt.

12:26.600 --> 12:27.600
Yeah, no, I got to try.

12:27.600 --> 12:31.600
I mean, I'm not saying that they're right or wrong because your requirements are very

12:31.600 --> 12:36.160
similar to my requirements and my sentiments are similar to yours, 13 versions in.

12:36.160 --> 12:40.680
I'm still testing it, I run it on a droplet, but I don't actually use it as my primary

12:40.680 --> 12:41.680
sync system either.

12:41.680 --> 12:45.680
In fact, when we're done recording the show, we won't be using the Nextcloud system I have

12:45.680 --> 12:47.200
running on a droplet.

12:47.200 --> 12:51.840
We'll be using a commercial platform to transfer the file, simply because you and I have just

12:51.840 --> 12:54.880
had better experiences.

12:54.880 --> 12:58.920
Well something I had a good experience with today when I tried it out was the new release

12:58.920 --> 12:59.920
of Android x86.

12:59.920 --> 13:08.760
I say new, it's 7.1 Nougat rather than 8 point whatever Oreo, so it's a little bit behind

13:08.760 --> 13:09.760
the times.

13:09.760 --> 13:14.720
Yeah, it came out in October of 2016, that is a little more than kind of.

13:14.720 --> 13:19.040
Yeah, yeah, but it is good.

13:19.040 --> 13:23.320
They've got this new launcher, so when you first boot it up, you've got a choice of launchers,

13:23.320 --> 13:29.200
the traditional one and one called Taskbar, which as the name suggests, is more of a traditional

13:29.200 --> 13:32.880
desktop with windowed applications.

13:32.880 --> 13:39.720
And it's not 100% yet because if you maximize a window, there's no way to get it unmaximized.

13:39.720 --> 13:43.240
So there's work to do there, but it does feel pretty cool.

13:43.240 --> 13:52.040
They've kind of taken some of the features from Remix OS, which is no longer available,

13:52.040 --> 13:56.600
and they've made something that's suitable for touchscreen devices or for a device that's

13:56.600 --> 13:59.780
using a mouse, but there's that big thing hanging over it.

13:59.780 --> 14:06.680
This is a very old version of Android, it's taken them over a year, well 18 months nearly,

14:06.680 --> 14:10.240
to get this version of Android to a stable release.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.680
And that doesn't look good for the project, does it?

14:12.680 --> 14:15.680
I'd like to hear more about your thoughts having tried it, because I did not get a chance

14:15.680 --> 14:21.360
to run it, but my response to that would be it's really about the Play API, isn't it?

14:21.360 --> 14:26.800
And Nougat is definitely in that range of very well supported from an application standpoint.

14:26.800 --> 14:33.880
Well that's true, and most people are on some sort of 7.x version of Android, and there

14:33.880 --> 14:36.780
are very few people who are actually using 8.

14:36.780 --> 14:42.640
It's only really people with the newest flagship devices that most of the world are stuck using

14:42.640 --> 14:44.680
7.x or even earlier.

14:44.680 --> 14:51.000
Very true, and what reduces the sting a little bit is they've managed to stick kernel 4.98

14:51.000 --> 14:55.080
under the hood, so it's a little bit newer of a kernel, at least as far as Android goes.

14:55.080 --> 15:00.960
Well yeah, compared to most phones, that is a very, very brand new kernel, isn't it?

15:00.960 --> 15:03.480
Most devices are on sort of 2 and 3 kernels.

15:03.480 --> 15:10.200
Now this is noteworthy because this is a pretty complete effort to move Android over to x86,

15:10.200 --> 15:14.760
and the Android x86 project has been around for a while, has a pretty big legacy, and

15:14.760 --> 15:19.960
they've built in support for things like supporting EFI boot, working to partition your drive.

15:19.960 --> 15:23.960
I mean it's a complete experience here, and so I think it's definitely worth trying if

15:23.960 --> 15:26.200
you're curious at all about what this would be like.

15:26.200 --> 15:32.000
I do know that there is a community project out there that is based around Oreo, so version

15:32.000 --> 15:35.800
8 of Android, and you can find that in the XDA forums.

15:35.800 --> 15:36.800
It's called Bliss86.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.640
I'll put a link in the show notes too.

15:38.640 --> 15:43.520
Now that's Oreo based, so it's newer, but it's not the official Android x86 project.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.640
It's a community project.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.960
It brings a bunch of different things together, but it'll be in the links if you want to try

15:47.960 --> 15:48.960
it.

15:48.960 --> 15:52.960
Yeah, and where this really feels at home, Android x86, is on my little Vivo book that

15:52.960 --> 15:56.240
I've talked about before with Plasma Mobile.

15:56.240 --> 16:00.120
It's a laptop with a touchscreen, so it's kind of the best of both worlds, and it really

16:00.120 --> 16:05.920
makes me pine back for the days when I had a QWERTY slider phone and had an actual hardware

16:05.920 --> 16:06.920
keyboard.

16:06.920 --> 16:11.240
I feel so much better with a keyboard, but I don't think I'll be ever getting one of

16:11.240 --> 16:12.360
those again.

16:12.360 --> 16:15.240
So just to be clear, this version has the Google apps?

16:15.240 --> 16:16.240
Is Chrome installed?

16:16.240 --> 16:17.240
Is the Play Store installed?

16:17.240 --> 16:20.400
Yeah, you've got Chrome in the Play Store, which is a bit surprising to me.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.080
I don't know how they get away with distributing it.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.080
Maybe they just don't really care.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.080
I don't know.

16:25.080 --> 16:30.520
But yeah, it's fully functional with all the proprietary goodness in it, which I suppose

16:30.520 --> 16:35.020
some of the audience won't be into, but the pragmatists out there will be.

16:35.020 --> 16:36.160
It's just ready to go.

16:36.160 --> 16:39.840
You can install whatever apps you want and just start using it.

16:39.840 --> 16:40.840
It's available as an ISO.

16:40.840 --> 16:42.920
I mean, if nothing else, you could chuck it in a virtual machine.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.440
I'm going to give it a go after the show.

16:44.440 --> 16:45.440
Yeah, do it.

16:45.440 --> 16:49.760
I mean, if you've got a touchscreen device, try and boot it up on that, because you very

16:49.760 --> 16:52.680
quickly realize that Android is not designed for a mouse.

16:52.680 --> 16:57.200
Although with this new launcher, it's a little bit more mouse friendly, but I think that

16:57.200 --> 17:04.600
ultimately there's a lot of gestures and stuff in Android that need a touchscreen, really.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.640
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

17:06.640 --> 17:10.440
It's a whole suite, a platform, if you will, of advanced training tools to increase your

17:10.440 --> 17:13.920
skills with, around, and all about Linux.

17:13.920 --> 17:18.960
It's everything you need to learn and get a hands-on experience, specifically hands-on.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.760
This is the stuff that really works for me.

17:20.760 --> 17:23.120
They spin up cloud servers as you need them.

17:23.120 --> 17:26.800
They're included with your Linux Academy membership at no additional cost, so you could go mess

17:26.800 --> 17:30.200
around in the lab if you want just for fun.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.720
There's no metered usage.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.000
There's no hidden fees.

17:33.000 --> 17:38.280
It just serves whatever you want to work on, and what's great about it is when you sign

17:38.280 --> 17:41.440
up with Linux Academy and you start doing some courseware, you pick which distribution

17:41.440 --> 17:42.440
you want to learn on.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.440
I think that's great, too.

17:43.440 --> 17:47.720
Think about the amount of work that goes into supporting six-plus Linux distributions that

17:47.720 --> 17:52.280
you get to choose from, but the great thing is they tied it in with the virtual machine,

17:52.280 --> 17:57.400
so when you select the distribution courseware, it matches that in the VM, spins up the lab,

17:57.400 --> 17:58.960
and now you can SSH into that same.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.160
Debian matches.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.320
Red Hat matches.

18:01.320 --> 18:02.320
That's brilliant.

18:02.320 --> 18:07.120
That's something that a company full of Linux users would think of and the competition can't

18:07.120 --> 18:11.080
even conceive of, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

18:11.080 --> 18:13.360
Go there to try out those hands-on labs.

18:13.360 --> 18:18.720
Try out the self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux and cloud and DevOps topic,

18:18.720 --> 18:24.440
from core Linux fundamentals to OpenStack and Azure and Google's cloud platform, and

of course, AWS, and they have practice exams to help you get ready for quizzes, and they

18:29.360 --> 18:33.600
also have a community stack full of Jupyter broadcasting members who are willing to help,

18:33.600 --> 18:39.920
as well as Android and iOS apps and documentation, courseware, and study tools, and lesson audio

18:39.920 --> 18:43.640
that you can just download and listen to and use offline.

18:51.040 --> 18:58.920
Okay, let's talk about elementary OS and anyone who's been anywhere near our Linux over the

18:58.920 --> 19:04.200
last week has seen the storm, shall we say, that this caused.

19:04.200 --> 19:12.600
So Daniel Foray, the great leader of elementary OS, posted a blog post on Medium that explained

19:12.600 --> 19:19.240
that although the app center is growing and making a little bit of pocket change, it's

19:19.240 --> 19:23.720
not doing brilliantly, and so they've thought long and hard about it and come up with a

19:23.720 --> 19:30.160
great solution, and that is that paid apps that you haven't paid anything for will not

19:30.160 --> 19:35.840
automatically update unless you put in how much you want to pay for them, and that can

19:35.840 --> 19:40.480
still be zero, but every time you get feature updates, that is going to be the case that

19:40.480 --> 19:43.400
you're going to have to keep putting in zero.

19:43.400 --> 19:48.600
Security features and OS upgrades are exempt from this, and they will auto-update if you

19:48.600 --> 19:53.440
want them to, and this is divisive to say the least.

19:53.440 --> 19:57.720
So to back up a bit, you mentioned they released some details.

19:57.720 --> 20:02.240
I really respect that they did this because this gives us real data to work with here,

20:02.240 --> 20:04.680
and I think it puts the entire thing in perspective.

20:04.680 --> 20:07.500
So they released their app center in May of 2017.

20:07.500 --> 20:14.760
It's got a lot of coverage and a lot of press, and they've sold, in that time, about $1,700

20:14.760 --> 20:15.760
worth of software.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.320
Well, $1,700 a day is not too bad, is it?

20:18.320 --> 20:22.120
Oh no, hang on, $1,700 in the entire time.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.440
Yeah, exactly.

20:24.440 --> 20:27.600
Yeah, that's a little rough.

20:27.600 --> 20:35.400
I think the average selling price was $2.30 for an app, and only about 1% of their users

20:35.400 --> 20:36.880
were paying.

20:36.880 --> 20:42.000
Now they did a poll, and they talked to their user base, and there was a bunch of different

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
reasons.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
You don't offer a trial.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.840
I want to try the app before I buy.

20:45.840 --> 20:50.200
A lot of times I buy the app, and then I forget to pay for it, and there's no way for me to

20:50.200 --> 20:53.800
go back and see what apps I haven't paid for.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.880
I think there's probably a few other reasons they're not talking about either.

20:56.880 --> 21:02.000
You don't have your purchases sync across your elementary OS installs, which would de-incentivize

21:02.000 --> 21:06.280
me a little bit, and it would incentivize me to pay a lot more if I knew I could pay

21:06.280 --> 21:08.840
once and it would count for all of my machines.

21:08.840 --> 21:12.800
I might pay more like $15 instead of $5.

21:12.800 --> 21:16.920
But since the entire system is around the humble bundle pay-for-what-you-want-to-use

21:16.920 --> 21:21.720
amount, I don't really feel like it's unreasonable on subsequent updates to say, hey, would you

21:21.720 --> 21:23.200
like to pay for this now?

21:23.200 --> 21:24.800
You're updating it still.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.340
You're still obviously using it.

21:26.340 --> 21:27.340
Would you like to pay for it now?

21:27.340 --> 21:28.720
Do you consider it valuable?

21:28.720 --> 21:32.480
Because that's just a kind of reminder, oh, yeah, I'm still using that great Markdown

21:32.480 --> 21:33.480
editor.

21:33.480 --> 21:35.840
I probably should kick that developer a couple of bucks.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.820
Yeah, I don't have a problem with it.

21:37.820 --> 21:42.360
As long as you can enter zero, then there's no problem as far as I'm concerned, but I

21:42.360 --> 21:45.240
can see why it would annoy people.

21:45.240 --> 21:52.000
But as Dan says in this post, you're talking about a complete paradigm shift in how people

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
expect to get free and open source software.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.720
People expect it to be free as in beer.

21:57.720 --> 22:03.240
And he says that previously the standard was zero and now we're talking about a non-zero

22:03.240 --> 22:04.240
number.

22:04.240 --> 22:09.720
It might not be very much of $2.30 per purchase and only 1% of people, as he said, but at

22:09.720 --> 22:14.240
least they are pushing forward in this new direction.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.320
And you kind of have to hand it to them.

22:16.320 --> 22:20.240
When I spoke to Dan on Late Night Linux, I asked him a lot of questions upfront about

22:20.240 --> 22:24.520
money and some people said that it was kind of a bit too financially heavy.

22:24.520 --> 22:31.000
But for me, the reason I did that was elementary stands out as a distro that really is not

22:31.000 --> 22:35.640
afraid to make some money and not afraid to say this is a lot of work and we're doing

22:35.640 --> 22:38.880
this full time and we need to monetize this.

22:38.880 --> 22:43.920
And I think that you have to take your hat off to them, that they are, as far as I know,

22:43.920 --> 22:46.280
unique in the smaller distros at least.

22:46.280 --> 22:51.480
I mean, you've got Red Hat who just blatantly charge for support and all the rest of it.

22:51.480 --> 22:56.960
But in terms of the so-called boutique distros, most of them have a Patreon and will accept

22:56.960 --> 23:02.180
donations and everything, but they don't put it upfront like elementary do and fair play.

23:02.180 --> 23:06.680
And to be clear, all of the open source free software that's being seeded from the Ubuntu

23:06.680 --> 23:10.560
repos and being shipped on elementary OS, that's all going to still get updated for

23:10.560 --> 23:11.560
free.

23:11.560 --> 23:14.920
The free updates, those things still get updated for free.

23:14.920 --> 23:18.000
They're not monetizing like Vim.

23:18.000 --> 23:23.840
They're monetizing applications that developers have handwritten for the elementary OS desktop

23:23.840 --> 23:28.280
and chosen to submit them to the elementary app center with the intention of attempting

23:28.280 --> 23:30.060
to monetize them.

23:30.060 --> 23:32.800
Those are the only apps that are being held for updates.

23:32.800 --> 23:37.520
Yeah, and these apps also adhere to fairly stringent guidelines, don't they, in terms

23:37.520 --> 23:41.380
of how they're put together so that they'll work well within elementary.

23:41.380 --> 23:42.380
So they're putting this out there.

23:42.380 --> 23:47.800
They're taking feedback right now, and it's going to eventually ship in the next version

23:47.800 --> 23:50.480
of elementary OS, which will be Juno.

23:50.480 --> 23:51.800
You say eventually.

23:51.800 --> 23:56.400
That's probably going to be mid to late April, maybe May.

23:56.400 --> 24:01.880
And the way time goes these days, man, that feels like about two hours away.

24:01.880 --> 24:02.880
That's true.

24:02.880 --> 24:03.880
That's true.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.840
And we actually have a bit of news for Juno while we're on the topic.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.800
There's going to be a big version jump.

24:08.800 --> 24:14.520
It's not openSUSE a jump to 42 big, but they will be going from version 0.5, essentially

24:14.520 --> 24:17.880
what they would have been, 0.5, to a 5.0.

24:17.880 --> 24:21.880
And like everything that elementary OS does, it seems to be already generating quite a

24:21.880 --> 24:22.880
bit of feedback.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.560
Well, yeah, they're setting their stall out, aren't they?

24:24.560 --> 24:27.200
They're essentially saying, we're no longer a beta.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.200
We're going to be 5.0.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.560
We're a proper release.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.480
It's a proper operating system.

24:31.480 --> 24:34.440
Pay us some money to use it, please, or not, if you don't want to.

24:34.440 --> 24:38.360
Yeah, rumor has it there's going to be a blog post out Monday or Tuesday.

24:38.360 --> 24:41.400
It pretty much lays out the reason for this.

24:41.400 --> 24:49.920
And it does a really good job of demonstrating the remarkable progress from version 0.1 Jupiter,

24:49.920 --> 24:53.400
which was really rough, to version 5.0.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.000
And it's understandable.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.740
And they're kind of saying a statement now.

24:56.740 --> 24:57.740
It's a platform.

24:57.740 --> 24:58.740
It's an app center.

24:58.740 --> 25:00.660
It's a user community.

25:00.660 --> 25:03.140
It's a design ethos.

25:03.140 --> 25:05.960
It's much more than a 1.0 at this point.

25:05.960 --> 25:08.220
And so they're going the full 5.0.

25:08.220 --> 25:10.760
They're going full 5.0, Joe.

25:10.760 --> 25:11.760
Yeah.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.160
Well, again, fair play to them.

25:14.160 --> 25:16.800
It's not a distro that I am personally using.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.680
But I can see its appeal.

25:18.680 --> 25:24.240
And it has an appeal to people who are coming from proprietary platforms who expect a certain

25:24.240 --> 25:25.520
polish.

25:25.520 --> 25:27.460
And I like to see that.

25:27.460 --> 25:30.640
It's good that we have that in our ecosystem.

25:30.640 --> 25:33.160
But in the meantime, I'm sticking with Ubuntu, I'm afraid.

25:33.160 --> 25:34.720
Oh, I'm shocked by that.

25:34.720 --> 25:35.920
I'm absolutely shocked.

25:35.920 --> 25:40.780
Of course, now you'll have plenty of time to implement Mozilla's new project, Project

25:40.780 --> 25:41.780
Things.

25:41.780 --> 25:42.780
Yeah.

25:42.780 --> 25:43.780
So this has been a long time coming.

25:43.780 --> 25:45.920
But now it's kind of officially announced.

25:45.920 --> 25:51.900
And it's their Internet of Things platform, where they are attempting to standardize the

25:51.900 --> 25:56.440
way all these Internet of Things things talk to each other.

25:56.440 --> 26:01.200
But the thing is, do we really need another standard way to do that at this point?

26:01.200 --> 26:03.520
Because we've got quite a few already, haven't we?

26:03.520 --> 26:04.520
Yeah.

26:04.520 --> 26:07.400
So you started with Home Assistant, and of course, I've interviewed the folks behind

26:07.400 --> 26:10.360
Edge X Foundry, which is now part of the Linux Foundation.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.000
Those are two very different marketplaces.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.400
One's for home and one's for the enterprise.

26:15.400 --> 26:21.160
And then you bring in Project Things, which feels like it's more enterprise focused, except

26:21.160 --> 26:24.960
for they're really specifically focused on supporting the Raspberry Pi.

26:24.960 --> 26:25.960
Yeah.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.360
And they talk about mapping out your home as well.

26:27.360 --> 26:30.240
So I think it's aimed for now, at least, at home users.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.080
But maybe they've got an eye on the enterprise down the line.

26:33.080 --> 26:35.680
Well, I think this is part of a larger strategy by Mozilla.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.980
This brings in Voice Control, which is using Project Common Voice.

26:38.980 --> 26:43.460
It's taking advantage of the initiatives that they've set up at iot.mozilla.org, where they've

26:43.460 --> 26:49.640
been working on a Web Things API that they're trying to get a W3 standard based around.

26:49.640 --> 26:54.680
And they've also created a Things REST API and a Things WebSocket API, and they're trying

26:54.680 --> 26:59.920
to create an industry standard as part of the web standards body that they would be,

26:59.920 --> 27:02.840
of course, one of the premier platforms for.

27:02.840 --> 27:06.960
And all of that said, this does actually seem like one of Mozilla's power areas.

27:06.960 --> 27:09.960
This probably should be one of the things they're focusing on and one of the things

27:09.960 --> 27:13.960
that we could use an organization like Mozilla applying a little influence over.

27:13.960 --> 27:15.800
Well, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

27:15.800 --> 27:19.180
They've got a lot of fingers in a lot of pies, and they've got a lot of money sloshing around

27:19.180 --> 27:20.720
to pay for it all.

27:20.720 --> 27:25.440
And as I always say, I'd rather an organization like Mozilla was spearheading this stuff,

27:25.440 --> 27:29.760
because if you're going to trust anyone, Mozilla seems trustworthy enough to me.

27:29.760 --> 27:33.680
Well, Joe, while you're out there buying your smart plugs and testing out Mozilla's Project

27:33.680 --> 27:37.240
Things, I'm going to save my pennies for a Nintendo Switch now that it looks like I'll

27:37.240 --> 27:39.360
be installing Linux on it soon.

27:39.360 --> 27:42.080
Yeah, remember Runs Linux as a segment?

27:42.080 --> 27:44.160
Well, this is a throwback to that.

27:44.160 --> 27:51.120
A hacker group has managed to get Linux running on the Switch, Fail Overflow they're called.

27:51.120 --> 27:56.280
It looks like it's just kind of command line stuff, and it's basically a proof of concept

27:56.280 --> 28:03.040
at this point, and it's really just a flaw in the boot ROM that allows you to run Linux

28:03.040 --> 28:09.040
realistically just to get pirate games running on it, or at least homebrew stuff, that sort

28:09.040 --> 28:10.040
of thing.

28:10.040 --> 28:11.040
Oh, Joe, where's the trust?

28:11.040 --> 28:13.080
Where's the trust, Joe?

28:13.080 --> 28:17.680
Well, yeah, but you're not going to be running a GNOME desktop or anything on it, are you?

28:17.680 --> 28:20.860
No, that's not the point, but it will push me over the edge.

28:20.860 --> 28:24.760
This is one of the most wanted devices that I haven't really just gotten a chance to pull

28:24.760 --> 28:26.120
the trigger on.

28:26.120 --> 28:31.060
And I gotta say, what I love about this is it's taking advantage of a flaw in the system

28:31.060 --> 28:37.060
on a chip, in the Tegra X1, that executes before any Nintendo code ever starts.

28:37.060 --> 28:39.840
So they can't remotely fix this thing.

28:39.840 --> 28:45.620
Probably best case, and the Failover developers are speculating this as well, best case, Nintendo

28:45.620 --> 28:51.000
could issue a new version of the Switch at some point, which ships with a patched version

28:51.000 --> 28:56.080
of the system on a chip from NVIDIA, but all of the existing Switches would still be vulnerable.

28:56.080 --> 29:01.960
Yeah, I can imagine an angry phone call from Nintendo to NVIDIA this week.

29:01.960 --> 29:02.960
What's going on?

29:02.960 --> 29:04.480
Sort this out.

29:04.480 --> 29:08.080
If Nintendo knew it was good for them, they'd leave it in there, because it's just going

29:08.080 --> 29:11.600
to sell this to a bunch of Linux nerds that were already on the fence.

29:11.600 --> 29:16.000
If I can get my games on there digitally, and I don't have to deal with this horrible

29:16.000 --> 29:22.040
Nintendo online e-store thing that they have, and I don't have to deal with cartridges,

29:22.040 --> 29:23.040
I'm all about it.

29:23.040 --> 29:27.660
We've got three kids, and this is the only way this kind of stuff works for us.

29:27.660 --> 29:28.660
This pushes me over the edge.

29:28.660 --> 29:31.280
The fact that I could put Linux on there, back up our stuff.

29:31.280 --> 29:35.520
I'm not even looking to pirate, I just don't want to have my kids dealing with any of that

29:35.520 --> 29:36.520
stuff.

29:36.520 --> 29:39.440
Yeah, but most people will be looking to pirate, and that's where they make their money.

29:39.440 --> 29:41.960
They don't really make the money on the hardware these days, do they?

29:41.960 --> 29:46.280
It's all on the games and the content that they're selling you after the fact.

29:46.280 --> 29:50.680
So I can see why they'd want to crack down on it very quickly if they can.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.880
Also, it's going to make a killer codey box.

29:53.880 --> 29:58.760
Yeah, if you can get it to that point, which we're not there yet, but it probably won't

29:58.760 --> 29:59.760
be long, will it?

29:59.760 --> 30:02.840
Nope, we've just got to get Wayland working on that thing and everything else will fall

30:02.840 --> 30:03.840
into place.

30:03.840 --> 30:04.840
Maybe a little Plasma Mobile.

30:04.840 --> 30:06.880
And if that ever happens, we'll let you know.
