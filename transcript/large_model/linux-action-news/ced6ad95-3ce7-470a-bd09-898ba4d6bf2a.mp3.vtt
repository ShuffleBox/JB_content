00:00.000 --> 00:09.160
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 222, recorded on January 5th, 2022.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.160
I'm Chris.

00:10.160 --> 00:11.160
And I'm Wes.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.160
Hello, Wes.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.600
The show is at its new time, but it is still the holidays.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.640
So there's not a lot going on in the news, but we did pick a few stories we thought were

00:19.640 --> 00:23.280
worth talking about, and one that, well, really makes me smile.

00:23.280 --> 00:27.620
It seems the future of the GNU PG project is quite bright, and they don't really need

00:27.620 --> 00:29.120
your donations anymore.

00:29.120 --> 00:36.240
Yeah, GNU PG maintainer, Werner Koch, posted an update on the project and its new associated

00:36.240 --> 00:43.360
GNU PG VS desktop line of business that is, yeah, as you put it, going quite well.

00:43.360 --> 00:50.000
Writing, quote, for many years, our work was mainly financed by donations and smaller projects.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.680
Now, we have reached a point where we can benefit from a continuous revenue stream to

00:54.680 --> 01:00.480
maintain and extend the software without asking for donations or grants.

01:00.480 --> 01:04.640
This is quite a new experience for us, and I'm actually a bit proud to lead one of the

01:04.640 --> 01:07.920
few self-sustaining free software projects.

01:07.920 --> 01:12.040
Yeah, and then he closes with, so you don't need to donate.

01:12.040 --> 01:15.720
If you had a recurring PayPal, it's been canceled.

01:15.720 --> 01:19.760
And he says that they really have a sustainable project now.

01:19.760 --> 01:26.280
And if you look at the history of this, it goes back to really contracts that came from

01:26.280 --> 01:30.280
the German government to implement open source solutions when they were bouncing back and

01:30.280 --> 01:37.240
forth between Linux and Windows, and they needed to bring their GPG system with them.

01:37.240 --> 01:42.820
And it's developed now into a full-fledged business that is supporting this critical

01:42.820 --> 01:44.840
open source project.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.240
And it's so rare that this happens these days.

01:47.240 --> 01:50.200
It just feels like that after log4j.

01:50.200 --> 01:56.080
It's nice to see years and years of hard work making software that the public can use at

01:56.080 --> 02:00.800
large, actually paying off and being recognized that not only is it just suitable for general

02:00.800 --> 02:05.560
encryption needs, it can also, maybe with just a little investment, be up to snuff for

02:05.560 --> 02:07.960
government security as well.

02:07.960 --> 02:15.120
You know what does strike me about it though, Wes, is what's making money isn't the core

02:15.120 --> 02:16.920
GNU PG, right?

02:16.920 --> 02:21.160
It's part of what's making them money, but it's this product that they've built on top

02:21.160 --> 02:26.840
of it, really for the Windows platform, that is bringing in enough revenue that it can

02:26.840 --> 02:31.600
fund development of the core technology that we all use in the open source community.

02:31.600 --> 02:32.920
I just find that kind of ironic.

02:32.920 --> 02:38.000
Yeah, I think it's an example of open source developers really having to be a little bit

02:38.000 --> 02:43.380
clever and go above and beyond to make things work out financially, where you can actually

02:43.380 --> 02:49.000
get a whole bunch of revenue and what exactly the best path for the pure open source project,

02:49.000 --> 02:53.760
those aren't always 100% aligned.

02:53.760 --> 02:58.560
Something I've noticed for years now, maybe way too long, is that right around the new

02:58.560 --> 03:05.220
years, speculation about Fuchsia OS always starts percolating.

03:05.220 --> 03:06.800
It's coming for Linux, you know.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.320
Yeah, well, is this the year, right?

03:09.320 --> 03:10.320
That's always the question.

03:10.320 --> 03:11.400
It could be.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.080
It could be.

03:13.080 --> 03:17.280
And I think for those of you that are curious, you're not familiar with it, we have talked

03:17.280 --> 03:22.360
about it on the show before, but Fuchsia is a Google project and it's designed to be entirely

03:22.360 --> 03:28.040
modular that really just means you can touch and adjust the system or change libraries

03:28.040 --> 03:32.680
and applications, remove things entirely, and it doesn't affect the core system.

03:32.680 --> 03:36.560
And then it uses a lot of modern technologies that a lot of developers are excited about,

03:36.560 --> 03:41.900
besides just C and C++, of course, but things like Rust, Go, and Dart are in there.

03:41.900 --> 03:46.720
And then the native front-end applications for the user environment, well, that's all

03:46.720 --> 03:50.760
Dart and Flutter, which has a bunch of excitement around it.

03:50.760 --> 03:54.720
And last but not least, there's the kernel, Zircon.

03:54.720 --> 03:59.560
Yeah, this isn't Linux here, it's its own kernel, something of a microkernel with a

03:59.560 --> 04:04.280
lot of stuff left to be implemented in user space.

04:04.280 --> 04:07.520
Now we all know there can be a lot of advantages to that, it doesn't happen with our beloved

04:07.520 --> 04:13.880
Linux kernel, but the folks over at Fuchsia are trying to make that work in a modern set

04:13.880 --> 04:19.440
of tools and operating systems and systems for security reasons, for maintainability

04:19.440 --> 04:20.440
reasons.

04:20.440 --> 04:24.200
I mean, I think that's what's kind of interesting about watching Fuchsia happen is it's just

04:24.200 --> 04:29.400
taking some ideas that aren't as mainstream right now and playing with them.

04:29.400 --> 04:34.840
And it's no longer just a test ground either, it's in production.

04:34.840 --> 04:39.800
In fact, Google just announced another IoT-type device is switching over to Fuchsia.

04:39.800 --> 04:44.360
See, they don't necessarily seem to be going after Android devices right now, but things

04:44.360 --> 04:49.260
like the Nest Hub and devices like that, they're swapping over to Fuchsia just right out from

04:49.260 --> 04:50.640
underneath the user.

04:50.640 --> 04:55.080
You can tell if you dig around deep enough, but you really have to know what you're looking

04:55.080 --> 04:56.080
for.

04:56.080 --> 05:01.020
And I don't know really if Android or Linux have to worry today, because I think initially,

05:01.020 --> 05:06.900
if I were to guess, Fuchsia will be the OS for people who don't want Linux.

05:06.900 --> 05:11.840
I know it's shocking to hear it, but there's actually a customer out there looking for

05:11.840 --> 05:13.240
a solution, not Linux.

05:13.240 --> 05:18.200
For whatever obviously incorrect reason, that is actually a customer base.

05:18.200 --> 05:23.460
And I think those people will be the first in line for something like Fuchsia.

05:23.460 --> 05:26.160
And hey, you know, it is open source.

05:26.160 --> 05:30.140
The question will be what kind of open source, how friendly will it be to non-Google use

05:30.140 --> 05:34.720
cases and where will it go from here, but right now, I just don't know.

05:34.720 --> 05:39.960
Oh, and we have a link in the show notes to a Fuchsia emulator, a portable Fuchsia emulator.

05:39.960 --> 05:44.440
If you want to play around with it, link in the notes.

05:44.440 --> 05:50.560
Well, speaking of Google operating systems, if you've ever used one of those x86 Android

05:50.560 --> 05:55.720
tablets, you'll know the experience isn't always great.

05:55.720 --> 06:00.200
But there's some interesting forthcoming work in the Linux kernel that might make things

06:00.200 --> 06:01.200
a little bit better.

06:01.200 --> 06:07.360
Yeah, it seems this is going to land in Linux 5.17, and it's a driver that aims to fix up

06:07.360 --> 06:08.360
a lot of these limitations.

06:08.360 --> 06:12.160
This is something that Michael Larble has been watching closely, and he has a write

06:12.160 --> 06:14.440
up a link to in the show notes.

06:14.440 --> 06:21.040
The gist of it is, these x86 based Android tablets, YaoMei makes some of these, Asus

06:21.040 --> 06:25.520
made some of these, they have some quirky ACPI issues.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.900
And amongst other things.

06:26.900 --> 06:30.840
And so this driver is looking to cover as many of those quirks or mistakes, whatever

06:30.840 --> 06:36.520
you want to call it as possible, to allow these aging tablets to work fine with a mainline

06:36.520 --> 06:37.520
Linux build.

06:37.520 --> 06:43.280
And one of the examples they have here is the Asus Memo Pad 7, which is pretty old.

06:43.280 --> 06:47.480
It originally shipped eight years ago with Android 4.4.

06:47.480 --> 06:51.960
But now after this patch, should be in a lot better shape for mainline Linux.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.560
Yeah, this is nice to see.

06:53.560 --> 06:58.280
I mean, it's nice to see mainline Linux getting, you know, better Android device support in

06:58.280 --> 07:02.280
general for a variety of reasons, not least of which is, hey, maybe eventually these Android

07:02.280 --> 07:05.320
devices will stop using such gross custom kernels.

07:05.320 --> 07:09.280
But this is also great for owners of these devices that might still have some uses for

07:09.280 --> 07:14.880
them long after the manufacturer has stopped caring about them.

07:14.880 --> 07:20.160
The GNOME Projects Libitwaita, the much talked about Libitwaita has hit 1.0.

07:20.160 --> 07:24.400
This is a library for implementing the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines, and it's going

07:24.400 --> 07:27.400
to play a big role in GTK4.

07:27.400 --> 07:33.440
Yeah, in GTK4, Libitwaita is basically the successor to the role that Lib Handy played

07:33.440 --> 07:34.440
in GTK3.

07:34.440 --> 07:40.160
Now, you should note, though, some of these changes are not fully compatible with the

07:40.160 --> 07:42.120
GTK default.

07:42.120 --> 07:47.000
So there will be some changes you might have to make to an application while you're porting.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.640
It's pretty aggressive, but there's some nice things that you gain here.

07:51.640 --> 07:57.120
They have some great examples on the GNOME blog, which we will link, especially around

07:57.120 --> 07:58.920
those of us who like to use dark variants.

07:58.920 --> 08:02.640
Now there's essentially a standard way for this to be implemented.

08:02.640 --> 08:07.880
Before the dark mode that was in GNOME wasn't really meant to be used at the level it has

08:07.880 --> 08:08.880
been.

08:08.880 --> 08:13.400
It was more for specific applications that needed a dark environment, like a movie player

08:13.400 --> 08:15.840
that maybe has a theater mode.

08:15.840 --> 08:20.980
That kind of basic functionality is what all the theme makers built on to create a dark

08:20.980 --> 08:22.320
mode for GNOME.

08:22.320 --> 08:28.500
But now, this dark variant that they have is built into Libitwaita, and that means that

08:28.500 --> 08:30.480
things look really good.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.940
And you'll have to see the screenshots in the show notes to see what we're talking about.

08:33.940 --> 08:38.280
But I would say it turns out on the typical GNOME desktop, there's probably four, five,

08:38.280 --> 08:43.240
six little edge cases that we've all just kind of gotten used to, but really shouldn't

08:43.240 --> 08:44.520
be that way.

08:44.520 --> 08:49.760
And historically, changing these things has been a really big lift, just the way that

08:49.760 --> 08:52.040
GTK did this.

08:52.040 --> 08:59.720
And so now, Libitwaita is splitting all of that out into smaller manageable files.

08:59.720 --> 09:05.680
So we may actually see it leads to more artistic license on the GNOME desktop down the road.

09:05.680 --> 09:06.680
We might.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.720
Yeah, you know, that really speaks to my inner developer.

09:08.720 --> 09:14.080
Sure, it may not be exciting outside, but when you have a big maintainability increase,

09:14.080 --> 09:15.720
I think you're exactly right, Chris.

09:15.720 --> 09:18.600
That just means it's easier to work on the project.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.800
That means you can get bugs done without having to pull your hair out.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.680
That's just good for everyone.

09:23.680 --> 09:24.680
Yeah.

09:24.680 --> 09:25.680
Yeah.

09:25.680 --> 09:32.480
And it's nice to see now like an official supported API that's cross-desktop for Darkstyle,

09:32.480 --> 09:39.080
which means that should now eventually work across GNOME and elementary, or GNOME and

09:39.080 --> 09:42.480
MATE, or GNOME and Plasma.

09:42.480 --> 09:43.480
That's great.

09:43.480 --> 09:48.560
There will be some adjustments to make room for that, but long term, it's better to have

09:48.560 --> 09:51.400
these things as a supported API.

09:51.400 --> 09:56.480
There also are some regressions, at least compared to Lib Handy, there are some regressions

09:56.480 --> 10:00.440
that mean that some swipe gestures will no longer work with the mouse.

10:00.440 --> 10:04.840
You have to actually use a touchscreen, and that's just going to require an update down

10:04.840 --> 10:07.320
the road to fix that kind of stuff.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.340
And I imagine as time goes on, we'll hear of a few other edge cases that come up where

10:10.340 --> 10:11.400
things don't work.

10:11.400 --> 10:16.720
But it truly is a 1.0, and I think it's a little unfortunate that the conversation around

10:16.720 --> 10:22.640
this started as no more theming on GNOME, because that's not really what's going on

10:22.640 --> 10:24.000
here at all.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.400
And it gives us some new base functionality that everybody gains.

10:27.400 --> 10:30.600
Yeah, it certainly seems like a necessary step to move forward.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.680
Sure, there's still a lot of work to do.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.240
There's still a lot of stuff that we'd like to see changed in GNOME, at least many of

10:35.240 --> 10:36.240
us.

10:36.240 --> 10:40.000
But yeah, congrats to the team.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.560
Linode.com slash LAN.

10:41.560 --> 10:45.840
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and you go there to support the

10:45.840 --> 10:46.840
show.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.740
Linode is fast, reliable.

10:48.740 --> 10:51.520
It's the Linux geeks cloud.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.920
Go try it for your next project.

10:52.920 --> 10:56.160
It's what I use when I'm just testing things out.

10:56.160 --> 10:59.000
I have been experimenting with a new server.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Photo prism.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.520
I don't know if you're familiar with this, but you can privately host and organize and

11:02.520 --> 11:08.760
share your photos, and it also can do the kind of Google photo style image recognition.

11:08.760 --> 11:13.440
I wanted to throw a lot of bandwidth and a lot of processor at this, and I wanted a lot

11:13.440 --> 11:14.440
of disk IOs.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.640
So that way I could just test it and just figure this out, because I only had about

11:16.640 --> 11:18.920
a half hour to spend on it.

11:18.920 --> 11:24.280
And Linode has recently been rolling out MVME PCIe storage, and that's just a game changer

11:24.280 --> 11:27.520
for applications like this where I'm analyzing the photos.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.240
It makes such a difference, and they can help you sort that stuff out too.

11:30.240 --> 11:36.200
They have fantastic support, the best in the business, 24-7, fantastic customer support.

11:36.200 --> 11:40.980
I mean, you know the kind of performance that MVME drives can offer.

11:40.980 --> 11:45.640
And then on their high-end CPU systems, they have AMD EPYC processors.

11:45.640 --> 11:49.840
So if you're a performance hound or your application needs a lot of storage throughput, Linode

11:49.840 --> 11:52.840
can really help you get something dialed in.

11:52.840 --> 11:57.440
And they're 30 to 50% less than the hyperscalers they're going to try to lock you in.

11:57.440 --> 12:00.560
And they have 11 data centers around the world, so you can go try it out yourself.

12:00.560 --> 12:04.760
They've been doing it for 18 years, and that $100 really lets you kick the tires.

12:04.760 --> 12:08.920
Go try it out and see for yourself, linode.com slash LAN.

12:08.920 --> 12:14.000
That's linode.com slash LAN.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.520
And a big thank you to Ting, linux.ting.com.

12:17.520 --> 12:22.560
If you're sick of overpaying for cell service, go see how much you could save and take $25

12:22.560 --> 12:25.040
off at linux.ting.com.

12:25.040 --> 12:27.720
They're an MVNO or a mobile virtual network operator.

12:27.720 --> 12:33.320
That means Ting gets access to the big nationwide carrier networks, but with way better customer

12:33.320 --> 12:36.880
service and at a lower cost for you.

12:36.880 --> 12:42.260
And Ting Mobile has the nationwide coverage you're looking for, LTE and 5G networks.

12:42.260 --> 12:48.920
And Ting was recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports in 2021.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.600
How about that?

12:50.600 --> 12:51.600
I already knew.

12:51.600 --> 12:56.760
I've been a customer since 2013, but it's nice to see Consumer Reports catching on.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.800
It's just a smarter way to do mobile.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.640
They have plans to start at $10 and go up from there.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.320
You can get the plan that has just the right amount of data.

13:04.320 --> 13:08.340
They have plans with unlimited calls and texts for $35 a month.

13:08.340 --> 13:11.600
And every plan gets Ting's award-winning customer service.

13:11.600 --> 13:15.560
They'll always make sure that you're taken care of and you have the freedom of no contracts

13:15.560 --> 13:16.560
ever.

13:16.560 --> 13:17.560
It's simple to switch to Ting.

13:17.560 --> 13:21.080
So just go to linux.ting.com, put in your information, get started.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.580
See if your phone's compatible at least.

13:22.580 --> 13:25.080
See what might be available in your area.

13:25.080 --> 13:27.560
Then create an account, order a SIM.

13:27.560 --> 13:30.120
You're gonna pop that in your phone once you receive that in a couple of days and you're

13:30.120 --> 13:31.120
gonna be off to the races.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.040
It only takes you a few seconds to get activated via the Ting website.

13:34.040 --> 13:37.560
It's simple to start saving money every single month.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.120
Why not get started at the beginning of the year?

13:40.120 --> 13:48.160
And then at the end of the year, you can look back and see how much money you saved, linux.ting.com.

13:48.160 --> 13:54.080
There's been a lot happening over at the Matrix Project over 2021 and seemingly a lot planned

13:54.080 --> 13:55.080
for 2022.

13:55.080 --> 14:00.840
And since it's been a little while since we checked in over there and they recently published,

14:00.840 --> 14:05.480
a huge breakdown of a lot of those goings on, well, we thought we'd take a look and

14:05.480 --> 14:08.500
highlight some of the stuff that stood out to us.

14:08.500 --> 14:13.480
And we have to start with some of the big breakthroughs they made in stabilizing memory

14:13.480 --> 14:17.280
usage in the Synapse home server.

14:17.280 --> 14:22.760
Now that's the home server powering Jupiter Broadcasting's Matrix server and a ton of

14:22.760 --> 14:24.640
production home servers out there.

14:24.640 --> 14:31.320
And well, it's safe to say that until now, it kind of ate as much RAM as it could find.

14:31.320 --> 14:38.360
But even the behemothmatrix.org Synapse server now apparently only uses two to three gigs

14:38.360 --> 14:45.640
of RAM, despite having more than doubled up to 1.1 million active users over the course

14:45.640 --> 14:47.520
of the last year.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.360
That's nice to see, isn't it?

14:49.360 --> 14:53.120
That is an area we've been chasing since we launched our Matrix server.

14:53.120 --> 14:57.040
I mean, I know they have other things in the works which we will get to, but it's good

14:57.040 --> 14:59.000
to see Synapse still getting love.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.780
Yeah, it really is.

15:01.780 --> 15:04.960
Another big feature that caught my eye was the addition of threads.

15:04.960 --> 15:10.900
Now okay, they're not actually quite out there in the lab right now, but that classic threaded

15:10.900 --> 15:13.680
model is finally coming to Matrix.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.760
And you know, because it's Matrix, this wasn't just a hack it in thing.

15:16.760 --> 15:20.800
Now there's been a lot of changes and conversations and debates and discussions about how to get

15:20.800 --> 15:25.480
this right and how to make it work well in the system that is the Matrix we have today.

15:25.480 --> 15:29.880
Yeah, you can't just have any old API, you got to have one that all the different clients

15:29.880 --> 15:31.440
can implement.

15:31.440 --> 15:35.200
So beyond just the software, though, there's been a lot of high profile open source projects

15:35.200 --> 15:38.640
that adopted Matrix all over the place throughout the year.

15:38.640 --> 15:45.240
Just to name a few, Debian, Fedora, NixOS, Arch, Tor, Ansible, and many others.

15:45.240 --> 15:48.840
There's been online events that have been hosted on Matrix with hundreds of thousands

15:48.840 --> 15:50.060
of attendees.

15:50.060 --> 15:55.120
And Element has really continued to act as the flagship client and really a spot for

15:55.120 --> 15:58.560
example development and official SDKs.

15:58.560 --> 16:03.360
Like I'm sure one of the very first places this new thread support will land is going

16:03.360 --> 16:04.580
to be an element.

16:04.580 --> 16:07.520
And that continues to set a pace there.

16:07.520 --> 16:12.280
There's just been also a ton of work this last year that went into making VoIP calls

16:12.280 --> 16:17.240
really solid, the person-to-person VoIP calls to make it maybe even your go-to solution

16:17.240 --> 16:19.240
for remote workers.

16:19.240 --> 16:24.680
And if you do switch over to Element for remote work, well, you'll be glad to know that 2021

16:24.680 --> 16:30.240
saw the long-awaited creation of a dedicated cryptography team that's just focusing on

16:30.240 --> 16:32.800
improving encryption within Matrix.

16:32.800 --> 16:36.440
Now of course Matrix has pretty much always prioritized encryption, but it's something

16:36.440 --> 16:41.420
that needs constant attention, so it's nice to finally see that happening so explicitly.

16:41.420 --> 16:47.000
As for 2022, well, the project definitely has some ambitious goals, including to further

16:47.000 --> 16:55.720
advance their new Matrix Rust SDK and possibly get that in use in some of their mobile clients.

16:55.720 --> 16:59.600
They're also hoping to improve Dendrite, which is a second-generation home server written

16:59.600 --> 17:05.220
in Go, and if things go well, could eventually take over as something of the default home

17:05.220 --> 17:08.120
server rather than Synapse.

17:08.120 --> 17:12.920
I don't know why, Wes, but something tells me we're probably going to make the switch

17:12.920 --> 17:13.920
when that happens.

17:13.920 --> 17:17.920
I mean, after all, we got to review it for show content at some point in the future.

17:17.920 --> 17:23.320
But I really am really impressed with the rate and pace of development, and our Matrix

17:23.320 --> 17:26.140
community has been growing at a rapid pace too.

17:26.140 --> 17:30.800
