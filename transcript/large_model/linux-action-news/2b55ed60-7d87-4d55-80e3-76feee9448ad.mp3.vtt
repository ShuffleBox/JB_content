Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

00:05.040 --> 00:09.000
Episode 119 recorded on August 17th, 2019.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm Chris.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
And I'm Joe.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Hello, Joe.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.680
Good to be connected with you extra early this week.

00:14.680 --> 00:18.380
This is like the last time for a little while that we'll be doing this early, but you got

00:18.380 --> 00:20.920
a chance to come out to the Seattle area, so we had to take advantage of it.

00:20.920 --> 00:24.920
Yeah, and that's meant that we've both had a chance to have a hands-on with XFCE 4.14

00:24.920 --> 00:25.920
together.

00:25.920 --> 00:30.240
Big news this week, XFCE 4.14 is released.

00:30.240 --> 00:31.760
Now here's the timeline for you.

00:31.760 --> 00:39.760
Just so we have perspective, 4.10 was released in 2012, 4.12 was released in 2015, and now

00:39.760 --> 00:43.640
we have 4.14 in 2019.

00:43.640 --> 00:50.480
Four years and five months of work, and I think the big takeaway is all the core components

00:50.480 --> 00:51.980
are now GTK 3.

00:51.980 --> 00:53.720
Just in time for GTK 4, eh?

00:53.720 --> 00:54.720
Hey, man.

00:54.720 --> 00:58.680
I'm still using some crazy applications that use GTK 2, so I don't know.

00:58.680 --> 01:00.400
I just don't know anymore.

01:00.400 --> 01:04.760
But I mean, with GTK 3, you're getting high DPI support in there.

01:04.760 --> 01:10.040
Yeah, and we tried that out on XPS 13 with a 4K screen, and it's almost there, isn't

01:10.040 --> 01:11.040
it?

01:11.040 --> 01:12.800
It's not quite 100% though.

01:12.800 --> 01:16.200
The way they've really implemented high DPI support is in the appearance settings, there's

01:16.200 --> 01:20.400
now a GTK scale factor by two.

01:20.400 --> 01:25.500
And that does make everything that's GTK double in size, but that doesn't increase things

01:25.500 --> 01:31.360
like your mouse cursor, it doesn't switch over your theme to a high DPI icon theme,

01:31.360 --> 01:36.760
it doesn't necessarily make the close, minimize, and maximize buttons in the title bar larger,

01:36.760 --> 01:38.520
doesn't even necessarily make the menu bar larger.

01:38.520 --> 01:42.880
There's still tweaks you have to make, but if XFCE has been your desktop of choice and

01:42.880 --> 01:47.240
you've just recently moved to a high DPI system, it can do it now.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.240
It's not perfect.

01:48.240 --> 01:53.840
Honestly, it feels about as much fiddling as Plasma feels like it takes.

01:53.840 --> 01:58.240
Other desktops are smoother, elementary nails it, but it's doable.

01:58.240 --> 02:01.360
I actually checked out 4.14 on two different distros.

02:01.360 --> 02:07.720
One was Endeavor OS, which is essentially Arch, and then the other is the Xubuntu 1910

02:07.720 --> 02:11.040
daily image, and both seemed fairly similar to me.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.320
The Xubuntu daily is what I tried out too.

02:13.320 --> 02:16.920
I'll put a link to that in the show notes if you want to try it out.

02:16.920 --> 02:19.680
It's not an impressive theme out of the box, right?

02:19.680 --> 02:22.400
I mean, that's one of the things the project doesn't really bother with.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.760
They let you set that.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.320
But there is enough fundamentals here.

02:25.320 --> 02:28.200
The new display dialogue has received a lot of attention.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.960
It has profiles now for multi-monitor configuration.

02:31.960 --> 02:37.200
There is sweet little just tweaks to different aspects of the settings screens.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.920
The file manager has received a lot of bug fixes.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.600
Overall, very rounded update.

02:41.600 --> 02:47.520
My favorite feature I have to call out is in the official notifications service now,

02:47.520 --> 02:50.480
they've gained support for what they call persistence.

02:50.480 --> 02:54.800
In other words, notification logging and do not disturb mode, which I had to hack around

02:54.800 --> 03:00.560
to do not disturb mode on XFCE in the past, because that's the number one thing in 2019.

03:00.560 --> 03:04.380
If you don't need high DPI and you sit down at an XFCE desktop, the notifications are

03:04.380 --> 03:07.520
just a nightmare if you get a lot of them.

03:07.520 --> 03:12.380
So having this is like the feature, the feature that I wanted in XFCE.

03:12.380 --> 03:13.600
This is my feature right here.

03:13.600 --> 03:14.600
I'm very happy to see it.

03:14.600 --> 03:15.600
Nice.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.640
But before you go dissing the theme too much, maybe I should turn my laptop around and show

03:18.640 --> 03:25.640
you that I use pretty much the same theme on 1804.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.080
I guess it works for some people, right?

03:28.080 --> 03:32.320
I think when you look at the screenshots of XFCE with that theme, which is what's all

03:32.320 --> 03:37.440
over the project's website and Zubunda's website, I think it's a big turnoff for a lot of people.

03:37.440 --> 03:41.600
Because you can throw ArcDark on there and it looks like, it pretty much looks like a

03:41.600 --> 03:43.080
gnome shell desktop.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.680
Yeah, but I'm just happy enough with the default.

03:46.680 --> 03:47.680
It's fine.

03:47.680 --> 03:48.680
It's easy enough to change too, right?

03:48.680 --> 03:52.640
So yeah, you probably, I don't know if you noticed, this is just like a really small

03:52.640 --> 03:56.720
feature they snuck in there in Parole, which is their media player on XFCE.

03:56.720 --> 03:57.920
It's based on top of Gstreamer.

03:57.920 --> 04:02.520
They've added more support for network streams, but more importantly for you and I, podcast

04:02.520 --> 04:03.520
support.

04:03.520 --> 04:04.520
Yes, very nice.

04:04.520 --> 04:08.720
One of the big features though is the multi-monitor support now.

04:08.720 --> 04:15.160
In the display settings, they've got an extra tab where you can save profiles for different

04:15.160 --> 04:19.420
combinations of screens, which is something that I think you're potentially going to take

04:19.420 --> 04:21.760
advantage of.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.820
Did not get a chance to try that because the XPS I have doesn't have a display connector

04:25.820 --> 04:27.460
that works with my monitors.

04:27.460 --> 04:31.320
But when I do get this loaded on my main desktop, totally taking advantage of that.

04:31.320 --> 04:36.720
And I could see this too on the ThinkPad, I travel between the studio and home a lot

04:36.720 --> 04:41.000
and I have a small screen at the RV and I have a couple of different screen options

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
here.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
So I will have a chance to play with it.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.360
And I hope, I hope, I hope this solves my multi-monitor issues I've had.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.880
I've got some bad news, I'm afraid.

04:49.880 --> 04:56.920
The bit of testing that I did with a laptop that's 720p and a 1080p external monitor over

04:56.920 --> 05:03.040
HDMI, it worked fine, but then I rebooted and just there was nothing on the screen.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.040
Oh man.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.040
Yeah.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.040
Okay.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.040
That's about what I get now.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.040
So.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.040
Yeah.

05:09.040 --> 05:10.040
That's fine.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.040
All right.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.040
A bit of work there needed, I think.

05:12.040 --> 05:13.040
Good release overall.

05:13.040 --> 05:18.920
I think probably you and I might be the most excited people listening to the show, though.

05:18.920 --> 05:24.360
It's just, you know, XFCE isn't the desktop that everybody thinks of as the big splashy

05:24.360 --> 05:25.360
desktop.

05:25.360 --> 05:30.080
I sure have learned to appreciate it's just get work done attitude and the slow pace of

05:30.080 --> 05:35.320
change, but still implementing things like GTK3 over time actually kind of works for

05:35.320 --> 05:36.320
my current usage.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.320
Well, yeah.

05:37.320 --> 05:43.920
I'm probably going to end up using this in Xubuntu 20.04 and by then it should hopefully

05:43.920 --> 05:46.180
have matured significantly.

05:46.180 --> 05:50.800
And these bugs that I've been talking about would have been ironed out and yet it will

05:50.800 --> 05:51.960
be modern enough.

05:51.960 --> 05:57.940
Okay, we'll probably be looking at some GTK4 applications and stuff by then, but realistically

05:57.940 --> 06:03.480
most of the stuff that I use that will be in 20.04 will just look absolutely fine.

06:03.480 --> 06:07.600
And so it's slow pace, but that's what's good about it.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.200
That's why I like it.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.020
They're not made any massive changes.

06:11.020 --> 06:16.960
It just looks like XFCE still and I'm going to be happily using it for many years to come,

06:16.960 --> 06:17.960
I think.

06:17.960 --> 06:18.960
Yeah.

06:18.960 --> 06:22.760
I'm looking forward to Xubuntu 20.04 and I'm like, I want to upgrade right now.

06:22.760 --> 06:27.240
I want to do not disturb stuff right now, but that is sort of silly with XFCE.

06:27.240 --> 06:29.160
It's slow incremental updates.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.160
Why rush?

06:30.160 --> 06:32.160
Wait for it to get refined.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.720
Kubernetes might be seeing a little bit of refinement after a recent security audit though.

06:35.720 --> 06:36.720
Yeah.

06:36.720 --> 06:40.460
The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which is part of the Linux Foundation, put together

06:40.460 --> 06:46.100
a security audit working group and they selected a couple of companies to do the actual audit

06:46.100 --> 06:50.480
of Kubernetes and they've done it all completely out in the open from the very start of the

06:50.480 --> 06:54.200
process to now the end where we've got the results of the audit.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.200
Yeah.

06:55.200 --> 06:59.840
The process took them, looks like about four months and the two different companies is

06:59.840 --> 07:01.160
an interesting way to do this.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.440
So hence the security audit working group.

07:03.440 --> 07:08.600
They manage these two different contractors that went through a whole process of selection.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.540
And isn't this just kind of the thing you love seeing some Linux Foundation money be

07:11.540 --> 07:12.540
spent on?

07:12.540 --> 07:17.080
And they even produced a few CVEs and security bugs from this thing.

07:17.080 --> 07:22.960
And really for the most part, it was a lot of best practices or inconsistent practices

07:22.960 --> 07:27.480
throughout the large project that weren't really being properly followed.

07:27.480 --> 07:32.940
But it is very important for a project of this size to have been audited because there's

07:32.940 --> 07:37.520
a lot of code out there, a lot of projects that have never been subject to an audit.

07:37.520 --> 07:43.300
And we just don't know necessarily whether there are some seriously bad practices going

07:43.300 --> 07:48.660
on there and some potentially unknown zero days in there.

07:48.660 --> 07:49.660
So you're right.

07:49.660 --> 07:52.780
This is exactly what the Linux Foundation should be spending money on.

07:52.780 --> 07:57.920
What we got as a result is four different papers, a Kubernetes security review paper,

07:57.920 --> 08:01.980
attacking and defending Kubernetes installations, a white paper that covers it all and different

08:01.980 --> 08:03.800
threat models that we're looking at.

08:03.800 --> 08:08.420
There was also a good batch of ancillary data that was created by these two companies that's

08:08.420 --> 08:10.000
also being published.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.260
If you are deploying Kubernetes in production, some of these can be consumed pretty quickly

08:14.260 --> 08:19.640
and give you a good overview of best practices that should be implemented in your own Kubernetes

08:19.640 --> 08:20.640
setup as well.

08:20.640 --> 08:24.980
That was another thing the researchers found is that some end users are not properly implementing

08:24.980 --> 08:27.160
and securing their systems.

08:27.160 --> 08:33.220
And a lot of times it comes down to inconsistent TLS implementations and just basic stuff that

08:33.220 --> 08:36.740
is easy to overlook, but an aggregate creates problems.

08:36.740 --> 08:40.060
So with Kubernetes out of the way, you have to wonder what's next for an audit.

08:40.060 --> 08:41.340
Yeah, yeah, you do.

08:41.340 --> 08:45.780
This process appears to be partially inspired by the Core Infrastructure Initiative, and

08:45.780 --> 08:52.320
they have a best practices badge program to get a badge when you're all secure.

08:52.320 --> 08:56.580
And then the Linux Foundation bestows this badge upon you and it's a way for open source

08:56.580 --> 09:02.480
projects to show that they follow security best practices, which honestly could be respected

09:02.480 --> 09:03.480
in the industry over time.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.620
I could actually see this working.

09:04.620 --> 09:07.700
It's kind of a clever idea and people will want their badge.

09:07.700 --> 09:12.240
And the Linux Foundation argues that consumers of the badge can quickly assess which open

09:12.240 --> 09:18.580
source projects have followed these best practices and will then be more comfortable selecting

09:18.580 --> 09:23.620
open source software and in theory, select projects that are of higher quality and better

09:23.620 --> 09:27.940
audited and better secured, which means more secure software being deployed.

09:27.940 --> 09:29.940
Well, that's true, but there is a flip side to that.

09:29.940 --> 09:36.380
It means that you've got the open source projects that are well funded, backed by huge companies

09:36.380 --> 09:39.980
that will get the badge and can afford to go through these audits and stuff, whereas

09:39.980 --> 09:46.600
the smaller projects that potentially are as secure and perfectly well written won't

09:46.600 --> 09:47.660
be able to afford that.

09:47.660 --> 09:49.900
And so you end up with a two tier system.

09:49.900 --> 09:50.900
True.

09:50.900 --> 09:55.300
Although it's also an opportunity for the community to create their own process and

09:55.300 --> 09:57.260
maybe their own badge system.

09:57.260 --> 10:04.060
I could actually see if this is a reoccurring thing where high profile projects are audited

10:04.060 --> 10:05.060
by two different groups.

10:05.060 --> 10:09.720
So you have people that are essentially peer reviewing each other's work and then you release

10:09.720 --> 10:14.660
all of the findings up on GitHub like they've done, that could start a trend and maybe the

10:14.660 --> 10:19.020
community will come up with their own community certified badge, millions of eyes viewing

10:19.020 --> 10:20.020
the source code kind of badge.

10:20.020 --> 10:24.860
And you could just have a big scene eye, like an eye of Sauron.

10:24.860 --> 10:29.260
So what you're saying is we're going to get one new standard and we should create another

10:29.260 --> 10:30.460
one as well.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.700
Seems like a pretty solid prediction to me.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.840
And then we'll need a standard that covers all those standards, Joe.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.740
You can see the process is already starting.

10:38.740 --> 10:43.320
In all, they identified 34 vulnerabilities, four of which were high severity, 15 of which

10:43.320 --> 10:47.660
were medium, eight low, and that seven were just informational.

10:47.660 --> 10:48.920
That's some decent results.

10:48.920 --> 10:53.520
And as you'd expect, the Kubernetes project is already releasing updates to address these

10:53.520 --> 10:54.520
security issues.

10:54.520 --> 10:58.340
Well, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation were very keen to have this all be out in

10:58.340 --> 10:59.580
the open.

10:59.580 --> 11:02.920
And that's something Google is also trying to do with AMP, right?

11:02.920 --> 11:09.660
The newer, bigger, faster AMP now with server-side rendering, which is going to change everything

11:09.660 --> 11:17.240
and they say will increase a whopping 50% on a popular metric called the FCP metric.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.240
Faster page loads.

11:18.240 --> 11:21.500
And get ready for this, Joe, server-side script rendering.

11:21.500 --> 11:25.580
That sounds like an amazing new innovation to me.

11:25.580 --> 11:30.680
It'll be a big change, you know, something consumers have never seen before and obviously

11:30.680 --> 11:32.580
will take AMP to the next level.

11:32.580 --> 11:36.020
Of course, the downside of all of this means is that JavaScript is working its way into

11:36.020 --> 11:42.820
AMP essentially, which is remarkable since AMP essentially started as a way to avoid

11:42.820 --> 11:48.540
really heavy scripted websites and deliver you just the results.

11:48.540 --> 11:52.740
We're essentially seeing a re-implementation of the web in AMP.

11:52.740 --> 11:55.700
It's to me the ultimate power grab by Google.

11:55.700 --> 12:00.140
Well, do you remember when it used to be called accelerated mobile pages and they've just

12:00.140 --> 12:02.140
dropped that now and now it's just AMP?

12:02.140 --> 12:03.140
Yeah.

12:03.140 --> 12:07.220
AMP plus SSR now for server-side rendering.

12:07.220 --> 12:11.780
There's been a lot of backlash to this because although it does mean that you can serve your

12:11.780 --> 12:17.260
pages more quickly and potentially compete with the Google cached stuff, it's just not

12:17.260 --> 12:23.500
enough really because the feature creep that we've seen with AMP, the JavaScript, okay,

12:23.500 --> 12:28.180
they're limiting the size of the JavaScript that you can use and they're trying to kind

12:28.180 --> 12:33.220
of keep the whole thing as tight and efficient as possible.

12:33.220 --> 12:39.500
But at this point, it just is a re-implementation of the web and they've already hooked in a

12:39.500 --> 12:45.380
bunch of publishers by essentially forcing them to use AMP in order to appear in the

12:45.380 --> 12:52.260
search results in a decent position and kind of sold the idea on one premise of it being

12:52.260 --> 12:55.820
just a very slim HTML page.

12:55.820 --> 13:01.500
And now over the last few years, we've seen more and more features come in that it's just

13:01.500 --> 13:03.300
essentially a standard website.

13:03.300 --> 13:07.500
Yeah, it's a little bit of JavaScript now, but before there was no JavaScript.

13:07.500 --> 13:11.360
So it could be a lot more JavaScript down the road.

13:11.360 --> 13:16.340
And I bet the next announcement from the team over at the AMP Council now will be there.

13:16.340 --> 13:20.260
They're going to introduce this grand new feature called Common Gateway Interfaces and

13:20.260 --> 13:21.300
you're going to love it, Joe.

13:21.300 --> 13:26.340
It's just going to be a great way to have active web server applications.

13:26.340 --> 13:31.580
I guess I'm really kind of getting, I guess I'm getting a little sick of what seems to

13:31.580 --> 13:37.740
be just a continual feature creep of AMP to take over the way we do web pages.

13:37.740 --> 13:42.680
And I hoped that when they went to this new council format of advisors, we'd see something

13:42.680 --> 13:43.820
a little more dialed down.

13:43.820 --> 13:46.820
But what we're seeing to me seems to be a more aggressive grab.

13:46.820 --> 13:53.380
And the worst part is, is we're still not solving the core issues of poor websites and

13:53.380 --> 13:55.260
poor server performance.

13:55.260 --> 14:00.980
And we're re-implementing things that we already have solutions for to get something that really

14:00.980 --> 14:03.620
only seems to benefit Google.

14:03.620 --> 14:07.580
There is some end user benefit, but there's nothing inherently unique about AMP that you

14:07.580 --> 14:12.340
couldn't provide directly as a publisher if you just invested a little bit in the technology.

14:12.340 --> 14:17.700
Well, this is all interesting in relation to some stats that I saw this week from JumpShot,

14:17.700 --> 14:23.820
which is the data arm of Avast, which shows that we've now reached over 50% of Google

14:23.820 --> 14:28.620
searches that don't result in a click through to a website, because often they'll just be

14:28.620 --> 14:31.560
a summary of the information that people needed.

14:31.560 --> 14:36.520
And therefore, they don't need to go to the website and potentially see the ads on the

14:36.520 --> 14:37.660
publisher's site.

14:37.660 --> 14:39.820
They just see the ads that Google is serving.

14:39.820 --> 14:41.580
Yeah, I think it's a combo of factors.

14:41.580 --> 14:45.420
These zero-click searches, as they're being called, is in part because Google's scraping

14:45.420 --> 14:48.780
a lot of sites, and then they offer up these knowledge cards, like you say, and then you

14:48.780 --> 14:50.080
just get the answer.

14:50.080 --> 14:54.700
Or there are more and more decent Google properties.

14:54.700 --> 14:59.020
When I search for flight info, I just tend to use Google Flights now.

14:59.020 --> 15:01.460
It starts right there in the search results, and I just engage with it.

15:01.460 --> 15:05.060
And then next thing you know, I'm booking my flight through Google Flights.

15:05.060 --> 15:09.580
And it's kind of convenient, and the prices seem to be fairly competitive.

15:09.580 --> 15:13.760
And I think, in some regard, part of why they're seeing less click throughs is because they're

15:13.760 --> 15:19.280
building better and better content, and also because they're displaying things in previews

15:19.280 --> 15:20.780
and knowledge cards and whatnot.

15:20.780 --> 15:22.260
But I wouldn't have any illusions.

15:22.260 --> 15:23.700
This is still good for Google.

15:23.700 --> 15:27.140
People spending time on their website, viewing ads, still making them money.

15:27.140 --> 15:31.460
Joe, I think we can summarize this by quoting at DZ on Twitter, Google backdoored themselves

15:31.460 --> 15:37.180
into having an alternative HTML spec that many media companies must follow for competitive

15:37.180 --> 15:40.340
reasons, and to be honest, we're all still just a little upset about it.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.020
That's really what it comes down to.

15:42.020 --> 15:43.620
Yeah, that sounds about right.

15:43.620 --> 15:47.020
Well, last week we talked about Linux Journal shutting down.

15:47.020 --> 15:51.700
And unfortunately, this week we have to talk about OSDisk.com shutting down.

15:51.700 --> 15:58.660
When's the last time you ordered a DVD or CD-ROM disk for a Linux distro?

15:58.660 --> 15:59.660
One or two weeks ago.

15:59.660 --> 16:00.660
Shut up.

16:00.660 --> 16:01.660
Never.

16:01.660 --> 16:02.660
Oh.

16:02.660 --> 16:03.660
No way.

16:03.660 --> 16:04.660
Never?

16:04.660 --> 16:05.660
Never?

16:05.660 --> 16:06.660
I've done it once or twice, maybe.

16:06.660 --> 16:07.660
No.

16:07.660 --> 16:12.780
I mean, even back when I started, which wasn't that long ago, like 2007-ish, my internet

16:12.780 --> 16:17.480
connection was fast enough to get the ISOs, and I had a bunch of blank CDs and just burnt

16:17.480 --> 16:18.480
all my own.

16:18.480 --> 16:19.480
Mm-hmm.

16:19.480 --> 16:20.480
Yeah.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.480
Yeah.

16:21.480 --> 16:27.260
Really, once the speeds of home internet connections got fast enough and USB thumb drives became

16:27.260 --> 16:31.020
so available, it just didn't really make sense.

16:31.020 --> 16:32.740
I actually kind of held out for a long time.

16:32.740 --> 16:36.980
I liked having disks, because I could write the distro on there and it was frozen in time.

16:36.980 --> 16:38.500
I could put it on the shelf.

16:38.500 --> 16:39.500
And it wasn't...

16:39.500 --> 16:40.500
I just...

16:40.500 --> 16:44.980
That feels wasteful to do with a thumb drive, but with a disk, it was like, ah, I've captured

16:44.980 --> 16:47.100
a point in time.

16:47.100 --> 16:53.340
Ramsey's the OSDisk founder, and the email out to customers starts so classy.

16:53.340 --> 16:56.740
After over 16 years, he writes, OSDisk.com has closed.

16:56.740 --> 17:01.380
If you've ordered from us, help is still available by emailing support at OSDisk.com.

17:01.380 --> 17:02.380
That is so classy.

17:02.380 --> 17:05.540
Even though we're shutting down, we're still going to try to answer your emails for your

17:05.540 --> 17:07.820
DVDs and CDs that you might have trouble with.

17:07.820 --> 17:08.820
Yeah.

17:08.820 --> 17:11.740
Well, I did have a dig around on the website, and that's the first thing it hits you is

17:11.740 --> 17:15.860
this message, but you can get rid of that and view the inventory.

17:15.860 --> 17:19.760
And really, I think it was more about the flash drives preloaded with various distros,

17:19.760 --> 17:24.900
and you could get kind of slow USB 2.0 ones or for a bit more money, fast USB 3.0 ones.

17:24.900 --> 17:31.060
But if you go to buy any of them now, the Add to Cart or whatever, then unfortunately,

17:31.060 --> 17:34.180
the message pops up again and says, no, no can do.

17:34.180 --> 17:40.880
Not horrible prices either, 15 bucks for a 16 gig flash drive preloaded with Ubuntu 19.04.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.820
For some people, that's not bad.

17:43.820 --> 17:48.700
I mean, there are people that have very limited internet connections, and it's worth that

17:48.700 --> 17:49.700
money to get that.

17:49.700 --> 17:53.500
I suppose, but with things like Etcher these days that make it really easy to use a GUI

17:53.500 --> 17:59.940
to get the image onto a USB stick and increasing speeds everywhere, it just kind of feels like

17:59.940 --> 18:01.380
it belongs to a bygone era.

18:01.380 --> 18:07.540
They did move on to flash drives from the DVDs and CDs, and I think that it's just the

18:07.540 --> 18:09.180
end of the road has been reached here.

18:09.180 --> 18:10.180
Well, clearly it has.

18:10.180 --> 18:14.820
2019 feels like it's been a few of those, a few things that are of a bygone era that

18:14.820 --> 18:15.980
are sort of spinning down.

18:15.980 --> 18:21.380
I mean, 16 years is a long time to serve the Linux customer base, so tip of the hat to

18:21.380 --> 18:23.060
Ramsey for that.

18:23.060 --> 18:28.700
And my new approach when I'm on limited bandwidth connections now is any time a distribution

18:28.700 --> 18:31.540
offers a net installation option, I am using it.

18:31.540 --> 18:37.540
I have just had the best results with the Fedora net install medium.

18:37.540 --> 18:39.240
You can choose every desktop.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.240
It's like it's almost better.

18:40.240 --> 18:44.260
You get more options and you get a smaller ISO.

18:44.260 --> 18:49.540
It's my favorite combo is more options, smaller ISO, and it only pulls down the packages I

18:49.540 --> 18:51.060
need to get that installed.

18:51.060 --> 18:56.060
And so that's been my way on more bandwidth-constrained setups.

18:56.060 --> 18:57.860
Ironically, I use the network install.

18:57.860 --> 19:01.020
Yeah, I've always used that for Debian.

19:01.020 --> 19:03.460
It's just the way to do it, really.

19:03.460 --> 19:04.460
Yeah, exactly.

19:04.460 --> 19:06.540
You know, FreeBSD has one.

19:06.540 --> 19:11.360
Just tons of different distros have net installs, and it's a good way to go if you can't go

19:11.360 --> 19:14.140
buy yourself a thumb drive, I suppose.

19:14.140 --> 19:21.300
But congratulations to Ramsey for 16 years of shipping over 300,000 disks and USB drives.

19:21.300 --> 19:23.760
That's a lot of new Linux users.

19:23.760 --> 19:27.220
Even if some of them already had Linux, you know at least a percentage of those were new,

19:27.220 --> 19:29.100
and that's pretty great.

19:29.100 --> 19:33.860
And they answered over 25,000 tech support tickets in their 16-year run.

19:33.860 --> 19:34.860
Wow.

19:34.860 --> 19:37.180
