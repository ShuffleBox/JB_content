00:00.000 --> 00:09.320
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 121, recorded on September 1st, 2019.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.320
I'm Joe.

00:10.320 --> 00:11.320
And I'm Wes.

00:11.320 --> 00:12.320
Hello, Wes.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.440
Thank you for joining me while the boss is on the road.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.680
We've got tons to talk about, so let's get straight into it.

00:17.680 --> 00:23.000
The big news of the week is that exFAT might be going into the Linux kernel sometime soon.

00:23.000 --> 00:27.800
As they say, it's important to us that the Linux community can make use of exFAT included

00:27.800 --> 00:30.620
in the Linux kernel with confidence.

00:30.620 --> 00:35.020
To this end, we'll be making Microsoft's technical specification for exFAT publicly

00:35.020 --> 00:39.280
available to facilitate development of conformant, interoperable implementations.

00:39.280 --> 00:43.140
Yeah, they've opened up the technical specification for exFAT.

00:43.140 --> 00:45.480
They haven't made it open source necessarily.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.480
Right.

00:46.480 --> 00:51.760
They're not providing any code at this time, just a spec of how the file system works.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.680
And well, of course, there's already a little controversy.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.200
Some developers say the spec is not even complete.

00:57.200 --> 01:02.240
Yeah, but the missing parts from the spec aren't really relevant anymore, are they?

01:02.240 --> 01:05.360
It's for Windows CE, something that's long dead.

01:05.360 --> 01:06.840
Nothing I want to use.

01:06.840 --> 01:07.960
Yeah, yeah.

01:07.960 --> 01:12.640
But the key factor here is that Microsoft is adding the patents for exFAT to the Open

01:12.640 --> 01:16.020
Invention Network's Linux system definition.

01:16.020 --> 01:20.240
They joined the Open Invention Network last year, and there were a lot of questions at

01:20.240 --> 01:21.240
the time.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.360
Well, what about your fat patents?

01:23.360 --> 01:26.720
Well, they've answered those questions now by adding them.

01:26.720 --> 01:32.480
So now anyone who's a member, which is pretty much everyone in the industry, can use exFAT

01:32.480 --> 01:34.520
without worry of any patent litigation.

01:34.520 --> 01:35.520
Right.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.440
There's even some code that's been floating around.

01:37.440 --> 01:41.720
But before this clarity around the patent issues, well, kernel developers were obviously

01:41.720 --> 01:43.200
a little wary about merging it.

01:43.200 --> 01:47.000
Yeah, and Microsoft have made it clear that they are not going to add it to the kernel

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
themselves.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.440
It is up to the community, as they say.

01:50.440 --> 01:55.320
And it looks like that code is going to be added to the kernel, but in staging.

01:55.320 --> 02:00.360
There's been some questions about the quality of the code, so having it live in staging

02:00.360 --> 02:05.240
for a while, get brought up to the kernel's high coding standards, and just, you know,

02:05.240 --> 02:10.160
get some more testing before it ships to any of our machines seems like a good idea.

02:10.160 --> 02:11.340
There's also still a debate.

02:11.340 --> 02:15.760
Some developers have talked about trying to build the exFAT driver on top of the existing

02:15.760 --> 02:19.520
FAT driver, although that's been tried before and proved difficult.

02:19.520 --> 02:23.200
Yeah, it doesn't look like that's the route that it's going to go, but it does seem a

02:23.200 --> 02:25.040
little up in the air at this stage.

02:25.040 --> 02:29.480
It seems more likely that it is going to go into staging and just be sort of cleaned up

02:29.480 --> 02:32.760
and eventually make its way into the main branch.

02:32.760 --> 02:36.680
Really to me, this story is interesting, not so much because of technology, honestly, I

02:36.680 --> 02:42.340
try to avoid exFAT, but just as a continuing spotlight on Microsoft's changing attitudes

02:42.340 --> 02:43.600
towards open source.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.840
Well, yeah, Microsoft loves Linux.

02:45.840 --> 02:49.260
They said that again in the post about this.

02:49.260 --> 02:53.980
And it really is getting more evidence of the change that has happened over there.

02:53.980 --> 02:57.880
And it's clearly of no benefit to them to make these patterns available because they're

02:57.880 --> 03:00.020
going to make less money from that.

03:00.020 --> 03:03.440
But I suppose the goodwill is probably worth it to them.

03:03.440 --> 03:04.440
Right.

03:04.440 --> 03:07.000
They want to be seen as part of the open source community.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.320
And exFAT has been one of the longest holdouts of their patent arsenal.

03:11.320 --> 03:18.120
The thing is exFAT is still fairly widely used in SD cards for cameras and stuff, right?

03:18.120 --> 03:19.120
Right.

03:19.120 --> 03:22.040
Crucially, it gets over the four gigabyte limit in FAT32.

03:22.040 --> 03:26.320
And if you're recording, you know, 4k video files, you reach four gigs pretty quick.

03:26.320 --> 03:30.800
I've seen people saying that it's kind of dead and not used anymore, but I don't know.

03:30.800 --> 03:35.920
I think my camera, although it's fairly old, I think that formats it as exFAT.

03:35.920 --> 03:40.440
So it's very annoying at the moment, you plug it into a new installation, and it doesn't

03:40.440 --> 03:41.440
work.

03:41.440 --> 03:46.640
Oh, yes, of course, I need to install Fuse and exFAT utils, which is just really annoying.

03:46.640 --> 03:52.120
So ultimately, once this does go into the kernel, it'll make a few people's lives a

03:52.120 --> 03:53.360
little bit better, I think.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.560
I'd call that an open source win.

03:55.560 --> 03:56.560
Yep.

03:56.560 --> 04:01.320
Well, somewhat sad news this week, and that is that Chris Beard is stepping down as Mozilla's

04:01.320 --> 04:02.320
CEO.

04:02.320 --> 04:07.760
He'd been there since 2014 and has overseen a number of large organizational changes.

04:07.760 --> 04:12.920
He's overseen Firefox kind of making a bit of a comeback, certainly in terms of technical

04:12.920 --> 04:19.520
quality and coming up to maybe not quite feature parity with Chrome, but certainly getting

04:19.520 --> 04:20.520
there.

04:20.520 --> 04:24.840
Because for a while there, it was really lagging behind and it was starting to get really slow

04:24.840 --> 04:28.560
compared to Chrome and just was not the choice of anyone.

04:28.560 --> 04:33.920
Whereas now, I think people are certainly in the open source community going back to

04:33.920 --> 04:34.920
it.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.960
I've heard at least anecdotal evidence of a lot of people doing that.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.440
I know, I certainly switched back during his tenure.

04:40.440 --> 04:43.080
Yeah, and there's no doubt that it has improved.

04:43.080 --> 04:48.320
It really did feel stagnant for a time, but now it's constantly changing.

04:48.320 --> 04:53.100
Some of those changes, like the move to web extensions, has been a bit controversial,

04:53.100 --> 04:56.840
but I think it shows a healthy and actively developed Firefox.

04:56.840 --> 04:57.840
Yeah.

04:57.840 --> 05:01.800
It does seem a little bit strange though that he's chosen to step down now, and he said

05:01.800 --> 05:03.480
that he's not going to step down right away.

05:03.480 --> 05:08.880
He's going to be at the end of the year, but that's still not a huge amount of time.

05:08.880 --> 05:14.680
And there's not really a great explanation as to why he's decided to move on.

05:14.680 --> 05:19.880
It is an odd time as Mozilla has launched a number of new campaigns to expand some of

05:19.880 --> 05:23.240
their product base and explore other revenue sources.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.760
Maybe that's just a bigger problem than he feels like handling.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.560
Possibly because it does feel inevitable.

05:29.560 --> 05:33.780
How long have we been talking about this though, that Google are going to pull the advertising

05:33.780 --> 05:39.760
deal and then they're going to be very much struggling to make any money, and that's why

05:39.760 --> 05:43.120
they've been going for these extra revenue streams?

05:43.120 --> 05:47.160
It could be to do with that, but it's just all speculation really, because it's kind

05:47.160 --> 05:53.500
of just the usual, I want to step back and spend more time with family and stuff.

05:53.500 --> 05:57.560
It just all seems a bit strange timing wise.

05:57.560 --> 06:01.800
It's also a reminder of the corporate structure that exists within Mozilla.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.800
They've hired someone to help them search for a new CEO.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.000
We'll see who they find.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.160
Yeah, they've retained the services of Tuck Richards from the recruiting firm Russell

06:11.160 --> 06:13.920
Reynolds to find a replacement.

06:13.920 --> 06:18.480
But in the meantime, if they can't find someone by the end of the year, Mitchell Baker is

06:18.480 --> 06:21.240
going to step in as interim CEO.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.920
She's currently the executive chairwoman of the foundation and Mozilla Corporation.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.160
Yeah, so she seems well suited.

06:27.160 --> 06:30.600
I wonder if she will end up just getting the job.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.680
It doesn't look like it from what she said, but you never know.

06:33.680 --> 06:38.520
And it should also be said, Mozilla is a very different company, and while they feel that

06:38.520 --> 06:42.480
the search committee knows what they're looking for, I can't imagine finding a new CEO who

06:42.480 --> 06:45.960
understands Mozilla's unique mission would be an easy task.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.920
Yeah, it's not your typical tech giant, is it?

06:48.920 --> 06:54.760
No, they're trying to build for an open and better internet and not necessarily just profits

06:54.760 --> 06:55.760
and returns.

06:55.760 --> 07:01.760
Well, more news from Mozilla this week, Thunderbird 68 is being released, and this is a huge release

07:01.760 --> 07:02.760
for them.

07:02.760 --> 07:06.920
I know you, Joe, and you must be excited about the new app menu.

07:06.920 --> 07:10.120
It's a hamburger menu, oh yes.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.840
But it's more than just small changes like that and the ability to mark all folders of

07:13.840 --> 07:19.920
an account as read and time zone, data improvements, spellcheck improvements.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.560
It's the huge under the hood changes that have taken place, which mean that now only

07:23.560 --> 07:28.960
web extension dictionaries and themes are supported, and the add-ons are only supported

07:28.960 --> 07:31.400
if they've been adapted to work with it.

07:31.400 --> 07:36.360
Because of this, the latest version, 68, is not a direct upgrade at this time.

07:36.360 --> 07:39.080
You're going to have to go download it manually if you want to try it out.

07:39.080 --> 07:44.680
Yeah, but 68.1 will come out fairly soon, and you will be able to update to that.

07:44.680 --> 07:47.800
With all these big changes, it makes sense that they're playing it safe this time.

07:47.800 --> 07:48.800
Yeah, it does.

07:48.800 --> 07:54.440
They've clearly thought about this because if you try and transfer your profile data

07:54.440 --> 07:59.400
to a machine that has an older version of Thunderbird, then it will warn you and won't

07:59.400 --> 08:04.280
open up unless you specifically tell it to allow the downgrade to that older version.

08:04.280 --> 08:08.840
And don't forget, they've included a little something for Chris here too, and that's improved

08:08.840 --> 08:09.840
dark theme support.

08:09.840 --> 08:13.920
Yeah, they're definitely getting with the times and making his prediction come true.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.320
So yeah, that's no good, is it?

08:16.320 --> 08:20.320
It is nice to see some of these UI and UX improvements.

08:20.320 --> 08:24.080
I think one thing that's held Thunderbird back over the years is it's just not that

08:24.080 --> 08:25.080
pretty.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.800
Yeah, it has definitely felt neglected, but it feels like they care more about it.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.920
I mean, they hired Ryan Sipes to be their community manager, and he's been really getting

08:32.920 --> 08:36.080
the word out there and really promoting it.

08:36.080 --> 08:41.600
And so it feels like Mozilla is starting to realize that, hang on, a standalone email

08:41.600 --> 08:44.000
client isn't something that's totally dead.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.080
Yes, a lot of people use webmail, but it's important to have a decent standalone email

08:50.080 --> 08:52.120
client as well.

08:52.120 --> 08:55.000
And they are the organization to do it.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.700
Right, to take advantage of the open and federated standard that is email, well, we need a great

08:59.700 --> 09:00.700
open source client.

09:00.700 --> 09:03.040
Yeah, we can't all just rely on Gmail, can we?

09:03.040 --> 09:08.720
Well, if you do rely on Gmail, you may be interested in Google's new Chromebook Enterprise

09:08.720 --> 09:09.720
devices.

09:09.720 --> 09:15.520
There are two new machines from Dell, the Latitude 5300 and 5400, kind of convertible

09:15.520 --> 09:21.640
all in one and just a regular laptop, which I checked and Dell are selling with Windows

09:21.640 --> 09:25.100
10 at the moment, but they're soon going to be selling them with the Enterprise version

09:25.100 --> 09:26.100
of Chrome OS.

09:26.100 --> 09:30.780
Now, that Enterprise version has been around for a while, but these are the first devices

09:30.780 --> 09:32.840
that come preloaded with that.

09:32.840 --> 09:36.220
And they've got a few enterprise friendly features, you know, the ability to remotely

09:36.220 --> 09:37.400
disable a device.

09:37.400 --> 09:41.640
You can delete all user data at an end of a session and well, you can integrate with

09:41.640 --> 09:44.600
the always popular Active Directory.

09:44.600 --> 09:49.120
Google also says it's massively revamped its admin console with performance and design

09:49.120 --> 09:50.280
improvements in mind.

09:50.280 --> 09:54.900
Yeah, this is Google really trying to have a go at Microsoft in the enterprise space

09:54.900 --> 09:58.240
because how long has Microsoft dominated that space?

09:58.240 --> 10:06.300
It's been decades, whereas now the needs of users in enterprise have changed really.

10:06.300 --> 10:13.520
And you're seeing the rise of iPad Pros and that tablet end of things, which Google hasn't

10:13.520 --> 10:16.700
really been able to compete in that area.

10:16.700 --> 10:23.580
Whereas Chrome OS now is very much established, very mature, and with these enterprise features

10:23.580 --> 10:28.540
could potentially take on Windows in the enterprise.

10:28.540 --> 10:32.200
And if that does happen, it means that we're basically going to have desktop Linux.

10:32.200 --> 10:36.520
Okay, you've got to put the asterisk there, but it is essentially desktop Linux in the

10:36.520 --> 10:37.520
enterprise.

10:37.520 --> 10:42.160
They've even emphasized in the release the ability to enable what they call managed Linux

10:42.160 --> 10:44.680
environments on Chromebooks.

10:44.680 --> 10:49.800
It's interesting how they've managed to target both simple end user workflows and more complicated

10:49.800 --> 10:51.200
developer focused tasks.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.600
Yeah, that's certainly the aim.

10:52.600 --> 10:53.600
But what do you think?

10:53.600 --> 10:57.320
Do you think they actually have a chance of competing with Microsoft in the enterprise?

10:57.320 --> 10:59.800
Because the enterprise moves very slowly, doesn't it?

10:59.800 --> 11:00.800
Yes, it does.

11:00.800 --> 11:05.520
And Microsoft has a long history of knowing how to work those relationships.

11:05.520 --> 11:09.660
Google a little bit less so, although I think it does make sense as they try to build their

11:09.660 --> 11:10.660
cloud business.

11:10.660 --> 11:11.660
Well, that's true.

11:11.660 --> 11:14.720
I don't know though, it's such an embedded thing.

11:14.720 --> 11:20.040
How many business people do you see on, well, in my case, on the tube with their ThinkPads

11:20.040 --> 11:25.440
and they're all running Windows and the fact that, okay, you can run local applications

11:25.440 --> 11:33.580
to some extent now with Chrome OS is still very much a kind of always connected operating

11:33.580 --> 11:35.620
system.

11:35.620 --> 11:42.340
And just little things like that, I don't know, for me, it feels like they will probably

11:42.340 --> 11:48.160
take some of the market, but I can't see them dominating to the extent that Microsoft have

11:48.160 --> 11:49.420
with Windows.

11:49.420 --> 11:53.120
Maybe some new organizations, people contemplating a change or upgrading their machines might

11:53.120 --> 11:56.960
consider this, but it's going to take a long time, if ever, to penetrate some of those

11:56.960 --> 11:58.720
entrenched markets.

11:58.720 --> 12:02.880
It is interesting though, these are decently specked machines, up to 32 gigs of RAM and

12:02.880 --> 12:05.240
a terabyte SSD drive.

12:05.240 --> 12:07.480
This is a long way from the first Chromebooks we saw.

12:07.480 --> 12:09.960
But it's not the very latest hardware in these.

12:09.960 --> 12:14.680
It's not like the 10th generation CPUs that we've seen in the XPSs that were announced

12:14.680 --> 12:15.680
recently.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.480
So Dell's not quite going all in on this.

12:18.480 --> 12:22.600
And it's interesting that Google have said that it's not an exclusive deal and that we

12:22.600 --> 12:26.480
might well see other OEMs shipping these enterprise Chromebooks soon.

12:26.480 --> 12:29.360
Hey, maybe that means better Linux drivers for everyone.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.120
Well, that was my thought as well.

12:31.120 --> 12:38.800
Does it mean that a Latitude 5300 or 5400 are going to be decent Linux machines?

12:38.800 --> 12:39.800
Probably right?

12:39.800 --> 12:43.200
Because they must have picked something that had reasonable Linux support in the first

12:43.200 --> 12:47.640
place and maybe they changed out the wireless card or whatever, but that's easy enough to

12:47.640 --> 12:49.180
do generally.

12:49.180 --> 12:53.720
So yeah, the more Chromebooks we see, probably the more Linux support we're going to see.

12:53.720 --> 12:56.800
Somehow Joe, I don't see you running one anytime soon.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.800
Not an enterprise one.

12:57.800 --> 13:02.080
I do have an old Chromebook and I've been thinking about getting a new one to kind of

13:02.080 --> 13:07.400
see where Chrome OS is because I've just been running proper Linux on it, gallium OS on

13:07.400 --> 13:12.280
my Chromebook for a long time now because it's so underpowered, but it would be interesting

13:12.280 --> 13:14.640
to see where they are with it.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.560
Maybe that's a good excuse to buy a new toy.

13:16.560 --> 13:17.560
That's how I'll sell it to my wife.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.560
Good thinking.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.560
That's a good idea.

13:19.560 --> 13:24.960
Well, soon I might be able to check and update the firmware on my huge stack of existing

13:24.960 --> 13:25.960
laptops though.

13:25.960 --> 13:32.040
Yeah, Dell has reached out to Red Hat's Richard Hughes to work with an intern and build a

13:32.040 --> 13:35.680
power user GTK app for managing firmware.

13:35.680 --> 13:39.960
Now this would be independent of the existing GNOME software tool that can already do some

13:39.960 --> 13:40.960
of those things.

13:40.960 --> 13:45.520
Yeah, the main difference seems to be that in GNOME software, that's all about just updating

13:45.520 --> 13:50.360
to the latest firmware, checking is there a new version available and then giving you

13:50.360 --> 13:53.560
that update, whereas this is more nuanced than that.

13:53.560 --> 13:58.600
This is more looking at the different versions of firmware that have been available in the

13:58.600 --> 14:04.200
past and you can potentially downgrade if an older update has given you some issues

14:04.200 --> 14:05.400
or whatever.

14:05.400 --> 14:08.280
So this seems like it's going to be a very useful tool.

14:08.280 --> 14:13.040
Of course, you can already do those things on the command line with thwupd, but having

14:13.040 --> 14:18.120
a GUI client, well, that would be great and it kind of speaks a lot to how far we've come

14:18.120 --> 14:19.520
in the world of Linux and firmware.

14:19.520 --> 14:24.280
It used to be that you had to go burn some sort of ancient free DOS application and reboot

14:24.280 --> 14:28.600
into it and hope that you didn't break your machine and now you just click a few buttons

14:28.600 --> 14:29.600
in a UI.

14:29.600 --> 14:34.120
Well, when I read about this this week, the first thing I thought was, hang on, System

14:34.120 --> 14:39.320
76 have just announced their firmware manager, which I talked with Chris about last week

14:39.320 --> 14:45.180
and how that can use either the System 76-firmware tool or thwupd.

14:45.180 --> 14:49.440
And so the timing of this seems a bit bad for System 76.

14:49.440 --> 14:52.280
It's kind of hogged their limelight almost.

14:52.280 --> 14:57.640
I suppose for us, it's still good that we've got a plethora of tools available, but you're

14:57.640 --> 14:58.640
right.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.600
There's sort of independent organizations working at the same task right now.

15:01.600 --> 15:05.260
Yeah, which could be a bit of wasted effort, but also competition is good, right?

15:05.260 --> 15:10.440
So maybe they will kind of push each other forward and we'll end up with two excellent

15:10.440 --> 15:11.440
firmware updaters.

15:11.440 --> 15:14.000
It's a bit like video editors, eh?

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
It is.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.960
It's interesting to note too that it seems to be Del further recognizing the value of

15:18.960 --> 15:22.960
working upstream in the open source community instead of having to roll something themselves.

15:22.960 --> 15:23.960
Yeah, that's true.

15:23.960 --> 15:24.960
Yeah.

15:24.960 --> 15:29.080
Well, also from Grom this week, they have been working with Endless on what they're

15:29.080 --> 15:33.640
calling the Coding Education Challenge, a competition aimed to attract projects that

15:33.640 --> 15:39.060
offer educators and students new and innovative ideas to teach coding with free and open source

15:39.060 --> 15:40.800
software.

15:40.800 --> 15:45.160
Endless has given them $500,000 in funding to support the prizes, and hey, that's a good

15:45.160 --> 15:46.160
chunk of change.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.420
It is a good chunk of change.

15:47.420 --> 15:51.960
And so there's going to be 20 teams selected from the applicants, and there's going to

15:51.960 --> 15:58.160
be various rounds where you can win various amounts of money, but ultimately the winner

15:58.160 --> 16:03.640
is going to get $100,000, and the second prize is $25,000.

16:03.640 --> 16:09.120
So it's quite a lot of money, seems to be well worth getting involved with this.

16:09.120 --> 16:11.320
Anyone is encouraged to submit a proposal.

16:11.320 --> 16:14.240
And I like the way they've structured this, you know, they sort of pick some of the better

16:14.240 --> 16:18.240
ideas, move on to a prototyping phase, and if you make it to the final round, well, you

16:18.240 --> 16:19.920
turn your prototype into a real product.

16:19.920 --> 16:23.980
You know, I was reading this thinking this is exactly the kind of thing the Grom Foundation

16:23.980 --> 16:29.720
should be doing, getting involved with other companies who can put up the money for competitions

16:29.720 --> 16:35.360
like this and endeavors that will generally further free and open source software, especially

16:35.360 --> 16:38.040
in education, because get them young and then get them hooked.

16:38.040 --> 16:43.200
But then I thought, Endless, didn't they lay off a bunch of people not that long ago, and

16:43.200 --> 16:48.320
don't they seem to just be constantly pivoting their business model?

16:48.320 --> 16:52.160
And so where did they get half a million dollars to put into this?

16:52.160 --> 16:56.320
Right, I mean, it makes sense that they'd want to support it, but that's a lot of money.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.880
They're obviously doing better than I thought.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.300
So fair play to them.

16:59.300 --> 17:02.680
If you'd like more details or to submit a proposal, well, you'll have to go check out

17:02.680 --> 17:04.720
the Gnome Foundation website.

17:04.720 --> 17:08.640
Of course, we'll have that linked linuxactionnews.com slash one to one.

17:08.640 --> 17:09.640
All right.

17:09.640 --> 17:13.200
Well, I always like to end if possible with a cryptocurrency story mostly to troll Chris,

17:13.200 --> 17:16.000
but I'm afraid you're getting trolled this time.

17:16.000 --> 17:22.200
And this week is that Telegram is actually going to launch his gram cryptocurrency.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.320
And it's got to do it by Halloween.

17:24.320 --> 17:26.920
Otherwise, they're in deep trouble.

17:26.920 --> 17:30.600
Back in 2018, they raised $1.7 billion.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.960
Yes, that's right.

17:32.960 --> 17:37.080
But they promised they would have this stuff launched by October 31.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.920
And well, it's getting to be crunch time.

17:38.920 --> 17:42.400
There were reports back in May that they'd canceled this initial coin offering.

17:42.400 --> 17:47.160
So it was a bit of a surprise this week when the New York Times reported that it was going

17:47.160 --> 17:53.400
ahead and that pretty much all 300 million users of Telegram are going to be offered

17:53.400 --> 17:55.020
the gram wallet.

17:55.020 --> 17:59.420
It's been a bit confusing too, because while Telegram has maintained a decent level of

17:59.420 --> 18:04.680
secrecy around this project, a lot of the work is being done by Ton Labs, which is a

18:04.680 --> 18:09.840
separate company founded to build developer tools for Telegram and well, they're kind

18:09.840 --> 18:10.840
of vocal.

18:10.840 --> 18:15.280
But this Telegram Open Networks, it is a little bit strange and it feels like it's just a

18:15.280 --> 18:21.320
hype that has died down and now they have to kind of deliver on hype that was sort of

18:21.320 --> 18:24.160
yesterday's news or last year's news.

18:24.160 --> 18:29.140
But according to Coindesk, the code for this was due to be released today.

18:29.140 --> 18:37.400
Now having to dig around and it does take a deep dig around, you can find a client available,

18:37.400 --> 18:41.760
but there seem to be some aspects of it that aren't readily available yet.

18:41.760 --> 18:42.760
Right.

18:42.760 --> 18:47.100
That client was leaked back in the spring and has seen some regular updates, one that

18:47.100 --> 18:52.480
was just published on the 31st, but no signs yet of things like their sharding implementation

18:52.480 --> 18:55.240
or the consensus mechanism used for the chain.

18:55.240 --> 19:00.000
Yeah, presumably that will be forthcoming probably by the time this gets edited and

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
released.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.200
So maybe this is bad timing by us.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.200
Of course.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.840
But what's interesting is that this is going to be compatible with Ethereum.

19:05.840 --> 19:06.840
Right.

19:06.840 --> 19:11.680
And the tools we're expecting should allow apps built for the Ethereum chain to run on

19:11.680 --> 19:12.680
TUN.

19:12.680 --> 19:18.000
Now we should note a lot of this information is not officially confirmed and all the interesting

19:18.000 --> 19:23.440
developers are kind of just hoping that the leaked information has so far been accurate.

19:23.440 --> 19:27.800
You basically just have to go find the tarball and inspect the provided files and hope that

19:27.800 --> 19:28.800
this is somehow official.

19:28.800 --> 19:34.320
What are you telling me that something blockchain related is sketchy and not to be trusted necessarily?

19:34.320 --> 19:35.320
Who would have thought?

19:35.320 --> 19:41.800
Well, we'll keep an eye on that and of course all the other Linux and open source news and

19:41.800 --> 19:43.840
report back on future shows.

19:43.840 --> 19:48.220
And the easiest way to get those future shows is to go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe

19:48.220 --> 19:50.120
for all the ways to get new episodes.

19:50.120 --> 19:53.520
And linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch.

19:53.520 --> 19:57.640
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.120
I'm at Joe Ressington.

19:59.120 --> 20:00.680
I'm at Wes Payne.

20:00.680 --> 20:13.320
Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next week.
