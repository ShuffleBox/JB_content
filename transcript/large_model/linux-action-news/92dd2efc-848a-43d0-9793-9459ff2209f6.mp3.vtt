00:00.000 --> 00:09.160
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 208 recorded on September 26th, 2021.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.160
I'm Chris.

00:10.160 --> 00:11.160
And I'm Wes.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.160
Hello, Wes.

00:12.160 --> 00:13.160
Let's do the news.

00:13.160 --> 00:18.960
And we start this week with a story that seems rather straightforward on the surface, but

00:18.960 --> 00:24.320
no doubt will represent a major engineering effort at Canonical.

00:24.320 --> 00:33.080
Computers still running on 14.04 LTS, old trusty tar released back in April 2014 will

00:33.080 --> 00:40.600
now have until April 2024, that's up from 2022, to finally make the move to something

00:40.600 --> 00:41.600
more recent.

00:41.600 --> 00:50.140
Wow, Wes, 14.04 is a different era of Linux, like we're talking like the last upstart era.

00:50.140 --> 00:54.340
It's amazing, but yet doesn't surprise me there's still plenty of people running that

00:54.340 --> 00:55.340
one in production.

00:55.340 --> 00:57.360
But that's not the only one getting extensions.

00:57.360 --> 01:03.520
No, 16.04 Xenial Xeris, which dropped into extended security maintenance in April of

01:03.520 --> 01:09.540
this year, has also been bumped from April 2024 to April 2026.

01:09.540 --> 01:14.600
I'm struck by this because a it's Canonical clearly responding to a market demand, which

01:14.600 --> 01:17.720
tells you there are people out there that need this.

01:17.720 --> 01:22.720
It also makes them more competitive in this enterprise space, and it gives a lifeline

01:22.720 --> 01:26.940
for Ubuntu admins who have other things on their plate besides upgrading their server

01:26.940 --> 01:29.080
operating systems.

01:29.080 --> 01:32.680
But to get access to these future updates, you're going to need to be an Ubuntu Advantage

01:32.680 --> 01:37.720
subscriber, which is free for limited personal use or Ubuntu community members, but otherwise

01:37.720 --> 01:40.160
requires an ongoing subscription.

01:40.160 --> 01:45.040
That's an important point, but not unreasonable, I think, for enterprise deployments who are

01:45.040 --> 01:47.120
depending on this stuff to keep working.

01:47.120 --> 01:52.240
Yeah, and subscriptions for support, super common in the enterprise space.

01:52.240 --> 01:56.800
And I think it's good for server admins that are still using 16.04 or 14.04 because at

01:56.800 --> 02:03.800
this point, it's significantly tricky to do the big leap upgrade, like going from 14.04

02:03.800 --> 02:06.760
to 20.04 is a massive upgrade.

02:06.760 --> 02:10.720
And admins have to do that math of trying to do the intermediary updates.

02:10.720 --> 02:14.840
So they'd maybe have to go to 16.04, then 18.04, then 20.04.

02:14.840 --> 02:18.480
We talk about a production nightmare on a server that's doing things that you depend

02:18.480 --> 02:19.480
on.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.000
And so this gives them more time.

02:21.000 --> 02:25.720
It allows them to focus on things like all of the work from home load that's been created.

02:25.720 --> 02:31.620
And I would guess they're likely now going to punt this problem until the next LTS comes

02:31.620 --> 02:37.520
out, which is going to be Ubuntu 22.04, and they'll just probably wipe the slate clean

02:37.520 --> 02:38.520
and go to that LTS.

02:38.520 --> 02:42.220
I mean, if they haven't upgraded by now, I don't know what makes you think they'll ever

02:42.220 --> 02:43.220
upgrade.

02:43.220 --> 02:47.360
Maybe they'll just beg for more support.

02:47.360 --> 02:52.400
Well this week, Google gave us some news on something kernel developers have been begging

02:52.400 --> 02:53.400
for.

02:53.400 --> 02:58.100
During the Linux Plumbers conference, we got an exciting update from a prominent member

02:58.100 --> 03:05.160
of Google's kernel team on his project, the Generic Kernel Image Initiative for Android.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.520
My name is Todd Chose, I'm the kernel lead for that project.

03:08.520 --> 03:14.120
And Todd is helping lead an effort to get Android using a vanilla upstream kernel one

03:14.120 --> 03:15.120
day.

03:15.120 --> 03:22.080
Mmm, yeah, and with Android 12 and Linux 5.10, based on the Android Generic Kernel Image,

03:22.080 --> 03:27.720
which is also known as GKI, Todd reports Google has cut down on the out of tree patches to

03:27.720 --> 03:30.520
an extent that it's been nearly eliminated.

03:30.520 --> 03:38.500
We have what we call the generic kernel, which is really the core kernel minus modules.

03:38.500 --> 03:46.440
And the big focus has been to get all of the SoC hardware specific code out of the core

03:46.440 --> 03:53.200
kernel and into separate modules so that we can get it as clean and generic as possible.

03:53.200 --> 03:59.000
It seems Google's motivation for taking this project on is focusing on reducing some major

03:59.000 --> 04:03.400
technical debt that they've built up over the years, and really just trying to get everyone

04:03.400 --> 04:08.960
in the Android ecosystem on the same technical page and make these devices more supportable.

04:08.960 --> 04:15.880
What actually ships on an Android device in the past has been a device kernel with changes

04:15.880 --> 04:21.440
that come from the Android team and from a reference kernel that we maintained, and then

04:21.440 --> 04:25.980
changes from an SoC vendor, and then changes from an OEM.

04:25.980 --> 04:33.560
And so the kernel that actually ships on a device is very custom for that device and

04:33.560 --> 04:38.560
very different from the upstream version of Linux.

04:38.560 --> 04:42.840
And they're making good progress on the GKI front, and also ensuring that vendors adapt

04:42.840 --> 04:46.360
to this new approach to cut down on this kernel mess that Google created with Android.

04:46.360 --> 04:52.060
Yeah, I don't think any of us are really surprised that this way of building the Android kernel

04:52.060 --> 04:56.800
for each and every device has ultimately become unsustainable.

04:56.800 --> 05:02.240
So the fact that this problem exists now is not really news to us, but what is a very

05:02.240 --> 05:07.680
pleasant surprise is to see just how much progress Google has actually made in addressing

05:07.680 --> 05:08.680
this.

05:08.680 --> 05:15.120
And where it gets really interesting is their outlook for 2023 and 2024 for further reducing

05:15.120 --> 05:19.160
that debt and getting even closer to upstream.

05:19.160 --> 05:26.440
2023, 2024, we believe that we'll start reducing debt faster than we are accumulating it.

05:26.440 --> 05:32.760
And the goal, of course, is to get as aligned with upstream as we possibly can, though since

05:32.760 --> 05:38.200
out-of-tree modules are really important for our use case, we do expect that we'll always

05:38.200 --> 05:46.840
have a set of exports and some things that are different or in addition to what's upstream.

05:46.840 --> 05:52.040
But this whole project is a multi-year project working towards getting rid of as many out-of-tree

05:52.040 --> 05:56.560
patches as we possibly can and aligning as much as possible with upstream.

05:56.560 --> 06:01.420
So while it seems like the nature of the Android beast is such that we might not ever have

06:01.420 --> 06:07.520
a truly vanilla Linux running on our Android devices, it is going to get really close.

06:07.520 --> 06:11.520
And that will be good news for both Linux and Android users.

06:11.520 --> 06:16.780
But the good news continues because it's not just about resolving that existing technical

06:16.780 --> 06:18.320
debt.

06:18.320 --> 06:24.520
Todd said that going forward, Google are going to pursue a, quote, upstream-first development

06:24.520 --> 06:31.440
model for new features, making sure new code first lands in the mainline kernel rather

06:31.440 --> 06:35.200
than being shoved in the Android kernel without upstream review.

06:35.200 --> 06:41.480
Yeah, and longtime listeners of Jupiter Broadcasting know this has been in the works for years

06:41.480 --> 06:45.520
and it's pretty much just exactly in line with what the Linux kernel team have been

06:45.520 --> 06:50.480
advocating the Android developers do since basically day one of Android.

06:50.480 --> 06:54.400
And while this is something that we have been following for a long time and are clearly

06:54.400 --> 07:01.160
rather excited about, Android end users probably won't notice much other than hopefully a better

07:01.160 --> 07:09.080
support lifecycle for their devices.

07:09.080 --> 07:12.440
When Valve announced the Steam Deck, it was pretty quickly noted that one of the major

07:12.440 --> 07:17.320
barriers to full Windows game compatibility was anti-cheat software.

07:17.320 --> 07:21.840
Packages such as Epic's well-known Easy Anti-Cheat are free for Windows game developers to use

07:21.840 --> 07:26.420
and there seems to be a lot of incentives for those developers to use those packages.

07:26.420 --> 07:30.240
But these same anti-cheat systems prevented games that would otherwise play just fine

07:30.240 --> 07:33.600
on Linux, perhaps under Proton, from running at all.

07:33.600 --> 07:39.960
This week, Epic officially announced full support for Linux, including native builds

07:39.960 --> 07:43.120
that support Wine and Proton.

07:43.120 --> 07:48.120
Though it should be noted, game developers do need to do a few steps to support the new

07:48.120 --> 07:50.720
version and update their games.

07:50.720 --> 07:56.000
Yeah, hopefully they do that, since it sounds like it's very little effort on their part.

07:56.000 --> 08:03.200
In fact, looking at the documentation, it literally reads it's quote, just a few clicks.

08:03.200 --> 08:07.460
But in addition to Epic's news, Battleye also announced along with their existing native

08:07.460 --> 08:12.440
Linux support, they're also issuing an update to support Proton and they specifically called

08:12.440 --> 08:14.760
out working on the Steam Deck.

08:14.760 --> 08:20.160
And just like with Easy Anti-Cheat, developers will need to opt in to this new Proton support

08:20.160 --> 08:21.160
from Battleye.

08:21.160 --> 08:27.280
Yeah, and it really is truly hard to convey what a significant development this is for

08:27.280 --> 08:28.280
Linux gamers.

08:28.280 --> 08:34.920
I mean, assuming game developers update, this is massive and Valve as well as both companies

08:34.920 --> 08:40.160
for Epic and Battleye have confirmed that this will work on all Linux desktops.

08:40.160 --> 08:42.000
It's not just a Steam Deck thing.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.040
It's a Steam client thing.

08:44.040 --> 08:47.360
I just personally hope we see the Destiny 2 developers update their game.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.880
I think they're Battleye Anti-Cheat.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.400
I'm not holding my breath, though.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.220
And I think that's what's going to make or break this thing, Wes, is individual developers

08:55.220 --> 09:00.320
stepping up and putting at least the minimal effort in to supporting these new Anti-Cheat

09:00.320 --> 09:01.320
updates.

09:01.320 --> 09:04.080
And of course, that's going to be significant for the Deck as well.

09:04.080 --> 09:09.080
Yeah, here's hoping things continue to go well and actually sticking with Linux gaming

09:09.080 --> 09:13.680
and Steam just for a moment longer, Valve continue to release upgrades to the Steam

09:13.680 --> 09:17.320
client with more and more tweaks for Linux users.

09:17.320 --> 09:23.200
Liam over at Gaming on Linux caught some of the interesting changes in the recent release,

09:23.200 --> 09:29.520
including improved startup speed, more robust game save via cloud sync and some fixes for

09:29.520 --> 09:31.280
remote play.

09:31.280 --> 09:37.840
Among other things in this release, though, there's new support that landed for PipeWire.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.000
How about that?

09:39.000 --> 09:44.460
How great is it to see Valve support a new core technology like this?

09:44.460 --> 09:48.180
And one has to wonder if this is because Steam OS is now based on Arch.

09:48.180 --> 09:54.480
With that aside, it seems that Valve has truly enabled PipeWire desktop capture support by

09:54.480 --> 09:57.280
default on the new Linux Steam client.

09:57.280 --> 09:58.280
That's huge.

09:58.280 --> 10:03.920
And it also means early support for PipeWire is going to enable better and improved performance

10:03.920 --> 10:05.140
on Wayland desktop.

10:05.140 --> 10:09.920
So those of us that are out there doing remote play, game capture and other AV features on

10:09.920 --> 10:12.600
Wayland should have a better experience now.

10:12.600 --> 10:16.040
But it's just really great to see this land before the Deck even ships.

10:16.040 --> 10:20.600
It's starting to look like a lot of things are lining up so that the Deck is really well

10:20.600 --> 10:26.000
positioned software-wise when it hits the public's hands.

10:26.000 --> 10:31.720
We've been keeping our eye on CentOS land, watching for significant developments to report

10:31.720 --> 10:33.400
back to you.

10:33.400 --> 10:41.680
A few days ago, AlmaLinux announced their AlmaLinux container images are now fully Red Hat Enterprise

10:41.680 --> 10:45.320
Universal Base Image compatible.

10:45.320 --> 10:51.360
With the announcement of CentOS's transition from legacy style releases to stream, most

10:51.360 --> 10:55.540
of us have been primarily focused on the traditional OS model.

10:55.540 --> 11:00.680
But containers are where a ton of business applications are run now.

11:00.680 --> 11:05.880
If you're not familiar with RHEL's UBI containers, it's not quite a full operating system, but

11:05.880 --> 11:08.360
it's more than just a base image.

11:08.360 --> 11:12.980
Actually you get three base images, and also a set of language runtime images to build

11:12.980 --> 11:18.040
your applications on, as well as a set of associated packages that satisfy most common

11:18.040 --> 11:19.040
dependencies.

11:19.040 --> 11:24.760
And that's why it's a pretty essential milestone for AlmaLinux to be offering a compatible

11:24.760 --> 11:26.200
alternative.

11:26.200 --> 11:31.720
It really makes their CentOS alternative offering more of a complete ecosystem, and not just

11:31.720 --> 11:44.760
focused on the standard distro replacement.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.840
And then you go there and you're off to the races kid.

11:46.840 --> 11:50.040
I'm telling you what 18 years Linode's been doing this.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.760
And they're independently owned and independently financed.

11:52.760 --> 11:58.260
Think about how huge that is for your personal confidence in the future of the company and

11:58.260 --> 11:59.260
their mission.

11:59.260 --> 12:03.720
They've been doing one thing for 18 years, making cloud computing excellent.

12:03.720 --> 12:08.080
They've focused on simplicity, affordability, scalability, and this has led to the best

12:08.080 --> 12:09.520
in class experience.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.520
And I mean it.

12:10.520 --> 12:14.320
But something fun you can do with Linode and that $100 60 day credit is why not go try

12:14.320 --> 12:17.720
out AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux at the same time.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.840
They've got images for AlmaLinux 8 and Rocky Linux 8.

12:20.840 --> 12:26.000
In fact, I think Linode has some of the widest and best Linux distribution support.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.920
I mean, even if you want to run that crazy SUSE Linux, they got images for that.

12:29.920 --> 12:30.920
I kid.

12:30.920 --> 12:31.920
I kid.

12:31.920 --> 12:32.920
I kid.

12:32.920 --> 12:33.920
They also have one click deployment.

12:33.920 --> 12:38.200
So it's really easy to get started with like Jitsi if you want to replace Zoom or NextCloud.

12:38.200 --> 12:42.440
If you're ready to get rid of Dropbox or other closed file sync solutions and want to control

12:42.440 --> 12:44.680
it yourself, go check out Linode.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.960
It's fantastic for our infrastructure and it can be fantastic for yours.

12:47.960 --> 12:52.320
And their pricing is 30 to 50% less than the major cloud hyperscalers out there.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.700
And they have so many great features you're going to love.

12:54.700 --> 13:00.440
On top of an easy to use, powerful cloud dashboard, they have S3 compatible object storage, they

13:00.440 --> 13:07.000
have cloud firewalls, DDoS protection, VLAN support, and a powerful DNS manager, Kubernetes,

13:07.000 --> 13:08.800
and so much more.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.520
Additionally, Linode's always investing in their infrastructure.

13:12.520 --> 13:14.520
That's why they became their own ISP.

13:14.520 --> 13:18.000
That's why they have AMD EPYC processors in their high end CPU systems.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.240
And now with their block storage, beautiful, brand new, super fast NVMe PCIe storage.

13:24.240 --> 13:25.760
Oh, it's so great.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.880
And they're always doing stuff like that.

13:27.880 --> 13:31.880
And you know, Linode could also be part of your multi-cloud strategy, something to consider.

13:31.880 --> 13:37.720
66% of companies are looking at a mix of cloud providers to help reduce dependency, I guess

13:37.720 --> 13:41.520
you could say, on the duopoly that is establishing in the cloud market out there.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.040
Linode can be a key part of that.

13:43.040 --> 13:47.160
And you can save money and have more reliability and have more leverage.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.400
It's a pretty great opportunity.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.160
And go try and experiment with that $100.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.160
Why not?

13:52.160 --> 13:54.560
Let's see how much you can get done with Linode.

13:54.560 --> 13:58.320
They've been around for 18 years, and they're a big supporter of community initiatives as

13:58.320 --> 13:59.320
well.

13:59.320 --> 14:02.760

14:19.560 --> 14:22.760
You'll see how much you could save and then take $25 off of that.

14:22.760 --> 14:27.040
Ting's secret sauce is truly they didn't have to dig the holes and put the cell towers up

14:27.040 --> 14:28.040
themselves.

14:28.040 --> 14:30.080
They're a mobile virtual network operator.

14:30.080 --> 14:35.160
That means Ting gets access to all of the big carrier networks, but at a way better

14:35.160 --> 14:36.160
rate.

14:36.160 --> 14:39.800
And they can add great customer service on top of that.

14:39.800 --> 14:44.640
As a customer, what it means for you, a great mix of plans and coverage at better rates

14:44.640 --> 14:47.200
with way, way superior service.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.540
Like I'm talking the interface to manage your account.

14:49.540 --> 14:54.080
You could basically do everything you would ever need to do with your Ting account through

14:54.080 --> 14:55.080
their website.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.420
And the customer support is the best in the business.

14:57.420 --> 14:59.940
And the nice thing about Ting is they got a mix of different networks.

14:59.940 --> 15:03.380
So it's very likely you're gonna be able to find coverage wherever you need.

15:03.380 --> 15:06.540
And you can contact their customer support and tell them, hey, I'm gonna be going in

15:06.540 --> 15:07.540
this area.

15:07.540 --> 15:11.480
So I need a SIM card that works the best for this area, and they take care of it.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.000
It's so simple.

15:13.000 --> 15:16.960
And every plan gets access to the LTE and 5G coverage.

15:16.960 --> 15:20.200
So lots of data you can go through if that's your thing.

15:20.200 --> 15:24.280
They also have plans for those of you who are very data savvy, you'd be surprised how

15:24.280 --> 15:25.280
much you could save.

15:25.280 --> 15:29.640
I mean, they have like their Ting set 12 plan, it's 35 bucks a month.

15:29.640 --> 15:35.600
You get 12 gigs of data and unlimited talk and unlimited texts for 35 bucks a month.

15:35.600 --> 15:39.720
Like if you're savvy with syncing your podcast in your music before you jump in the car or

15:39.720 --> 15:42.840
something like that, that's a great deal.

15:42.840 --> 15:46.520
But no matter how much data you need, or maybe you want a family plan, they've got stuff

15:46.520 --> 15:47.520
that's gonna cover you.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.360
I mean, they've got plans for everything.

15:49.360 --> 15:52.760
That's why it's so great that it's simple to switch to Ting, because pretty much any

15:52.760 --> 15:55.680
phone will already work since they support a ton of networks.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.640
So just go try it out and get started.

15:57.640 --> 16:03.180
You go to linux.ting.com, you check your current phone out, they got a really nice UI for that.

16:03.180 --> 16:05.860
If everything's looking right, you create an account, you pick the plan that's right

16:05.860 --> 16:09.600
for you, Ting will shoot you a SIM card, you pop that in your phone and you're gonna get

16:09.600 --> 16:11.160
activated in minutes.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.960
And once you get all set up, be sure to check out the Ting blog, they're always posting

16:13.960 --> 16:16.840
about giveaways or tips to use the network.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.720
It's so simple now with Ting to cut your phone bill in half.

16:19.720 --> 16:22.920
There's no reason you should be paying so much for wireless anymore.

16:22.920 --> 16:26.580
Go see how much you could save and then take $25 off of that.

16:26.580 --> 16:30.480
And you can support the show at linux.ting.com.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.440
There's never been a better time to try Ting Mobile.

16:32.440 --> 16:37.440
I can say that because I've been a customer since 2013 and Ting just keeps getting better.

16:37.440 --> 16:40.000
Go support the show and see how much you could save.

16:40.000 --> 16:46.520
linux.ting.com Gnome 41 was released this week.

16:46.520 --> 16:50.440
It's the second release to use Gnome's new number versioning scheme.

16:50.440 --> 16:56.760
And while perhaps not the big change that Gnome 40 was, there are still plenty of improvements

16:56.760 --> 16:57.760
packed in.

16:57.760 --> 17:02.640
Gnome Software Center received a considerable amount of attention this time around.

17:02.640 --> 17:08.980
Nearly every part of Gnome software was polished or improved in some way, including a new visual

17:08.980 --> 17:12.920
overhaul with significantly improved application listings.

17:12.920 --> 17:17.560
Oh, Wes, the new Gnome software application listings look so much better now.

17:17.560 --> 17:21.760
They've added what they call context tiles to app pages that they just give the user

17:21.760 --> 17:26.840
more information about the device support, the permissions it might need, age rating,

17:26.840 --> 17:30.640
if you care about that kind of thing, file size, which I always care about and more.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.840
It's all just really displayed in a clean, easy to read format.

17:34.840 --> 17:40.240
Along with that kind of stuff, you also get a list of available add-ons if your app has

17:40.240 --> 17:41.240
them.

17:41.240 --> 17:44.360
So like say GIMP might have a bunch of plugins you can install from Gnome software.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.880
They all get listed right there on one page, so you can install your app and all of its

17:47.880 --> 17:50.000
add-ons now in one go.

17:50.000 --> 17:56.120
Outside of Gnome software, the new multitasking options are nice to see as well.

17:56.120 --> 18:00.720
You can now toggle off Gnome's hot corner for the activities overview, something I know

18:00.720 --> 18:05.480
a lot of you out there previously used an extension to achieve.

18:05.480 --> 18:10.680
On top of that, they now let you tweak the settings for resizing applications and what

18:10.680 --> 18:14.440
happens when you slam them against the edge of the screen.

18:14.440 --> 18:18.240
Also nice to see is some settings that you used to have to dig around in Gnome tweaks

18:18.240 --> 18:19.240
to find.

18:19.240 --> 18:24.080
Those have been moved into the multitasking settings, things like choosing between fixed

18:24.080 --> 18:26.480
and dynamic workspaces.

18:26.480 --> 18:32.040
And I know you were really happy to see this one added, Chris, new options for how workspaces

18:32.040 --> 18:34.760
behave when you have multiple monitors.

18:34.760 --> 18:36.340
We really wanted to see this.

18:36.340 --> 18:38.000
This is, this is great.

18:38.000 --> 18:44.160
It was a major pain point for some with the transition to Gnome 40 and the new horizontal

18:44.160 --> 18:45.160
workspaces.

18:45.160 --> 18:50.520
Now users can choose if workspaces are only on the primary display or if all monitors

18:50.520 --> 18:51.880
have workspaces.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.240
That's great.

18:53.240 --> 18:58.320
And one of the significant areas of improvements in Gnome 41 is the power mode feature.

18:58.320 --> 19:01.300
The early version of this was introduced in Gnome 40.

19:01.300 --> 19:05.720
But now in Gnome 41, it's like a premium feature.

19:05.720 --> 19:09.140
Power modes can now be quickly changed from the system status menu, which I used to have

19:09.140 --> 19:11.080
to install an extension for.

19:11.080 --> 19:15.840
And nice to see this too, they will automatically enable the power saver mode of power modes

19:15.840 --> 19:18.600
when your battery runs low.

19:18.600 --> 19:24.160
Power has also been added for applications to request a specific power mode, something

19:24.160 --> 19:27.000
that maybe a game would do because it really needs performance.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
Yeah.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
Or maybe your video editor.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.840
And a nice little quality of life aspect of this feature is power modes are sometimes

19:33.840 --> 19:34.840
disabled.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.840
Now stick with me here.

19:35.840 --> 19:40.220
They're sometimes disabled depending on your system's hardware support.

19:40.220 --> 19:45.060
So sometimes like in my case of testing, they were temporarily disabled because of a thermal

19:45.060 --> 19:46.760
issue on my laptop.

19:46.760 --> 19:50.200
Or on some systems, if you just don't support it at all, they won't show up.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.200
They just won't show up in Gnome settings.

19:52.200 --> 19:56.200
I once saw a warning during my testing that said they will be disabled.

19:56.200 --> 19:59.480
Power modes will be disabled until you put it on the table.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.160
You got to get it out of your lap and put it on the table.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.800
I don't exactly know why.

20:02.800 --> 20:05.320
I would assume it had something to do with airflow.

20:05.320 --> 20:09.880
Another time I was told that power modes would be disabled until the temperature of my laptop

20:09.880 --> 20:11.800
was down to safe levels.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.040
And honestly, I think that kind of makes sense.

20:13.040 --> 20:17.200
I mean, I don't want to turn on performance mode and cook my laptop, but just, I mean,

20:17.200 --> 20:20.960
personally, I think it was great to see the Gnome developers play around with this deep

20:20.960 --> 20:23.040
level of integration with the system.

20:23.040 --> 20:27.580
That's kind of like the new mobile network settings, which also only show up when you

20:27.580 --> 20:30.060
have hardware that supports them.

20:30.060 --> 20:35.960
This helps keep the complexity down on systems that don't have, say, a fancy LTE modem.

20:35.960 --> 20:41.840
41 also introduces the Gnome Connections app, which is an efficient tool that lets you connect

20:41.840 --> 20:47.280
to most remote desktop protocols in a clean, easy-to-manage UI.

20:47.280 --> 20:51.340
And 41 sees the introduction of LibAdueda, which lays the groundwork for a new approach

20:51.340 --> 20:57.380
to styling Gnome apps in the future and will have significant implications in Gnome 42.

20:57.380 --> 21:00.720
For more details on that, see Linux Unplugged 4.24.

21:00.720 --> 21:05.720
It's worth noting the new Gnome release also comes with significant improvements for developers,

21:05.720 --> 21:10.360
including a new developer documentation website, a major update to the human interface guidelines,

21:10.360 --> 21:15.000
new features in the builder IDE, GTK4 enhancements, and really a lot more, Wes.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.600
It should also be said that there are also the usual performance improvements and bug

21:19.600 --> 21:25.000
fixes to make Gnome faster, as well as more stable, reliable, and flexible, believe it

21:25.000 --> 21:26.000
or not.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.200
For example, the screen will now update faster on Wayland in response to keyboard and pointer

21:30.200 --> 21:35.200
input, the system-level multi-touch gestures are now more consistent and reliable, and

21:35.200 --> 21:42.940
a new default GL renderer in GTK4 provides faster rendering and reduced power consumption.

21:42.940 --> 21:48.480
And finally, a major code cleanup has been carried out in Mudder, Gnome's window manager,

21:48.480 --> 21:53.960
which really should help improve long-term maintainability and efficiency.

21:53.960 --> 21:54.960
That's great to see.

21:54.960 --> 21:59.120
It is, and it's always nice to address technical debt, as we talked about earlier in the show.

21:59.120 --> 22:02.640
I have to say, this, they nailed it.

22:02.640 --> 22:07.080
The new multitasking settings and options, really that addressed my major concerns with

22:07.080 --> 22:11.000
horizontal workspaces, and I bet a lot of folks out there that had concerns.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.760
This is, 41's worth trying now, I think they may have fixed it for you.

22:14.760 --> 22:20.480
I spent the last week in Gnome 41, and I think this is a fantastic release.

22:20.480 --> 22:24.880
If you're a happy Gnome user today, you're gonna get even more of what you already love

22:24.880 --> 22:25.880
with Gnome 41.

22:25.880 --> 22:30.080
Yeah, it may not be for everyone, but if you wanna get your hands on it, you're gonna see

22:30.080 --> 22:34.240
it land pretty soon in Fedora 35, which will be out in about a month.

22:34.240 --> 22:38.200
That ships with Gnome 41 out of the box, but if you just can't wait, we've got a link to

22:38.200 --> 22:43.280
Fedora 35's beta in the show notes, and we'll keep an eye on that development and everything

22:43.280 --> 22:47.560
