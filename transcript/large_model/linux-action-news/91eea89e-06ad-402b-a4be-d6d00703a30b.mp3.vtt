00:00.000 --> 00:11.160
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News. Episode 262, recorded on October 12, 2022. I'm Chris.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.160
And I'm Wes.

00:12.160 --> 00:15.700
Hello, Wes. Let's do the news.

00:15.700 --> 00:22.080
We start this week with the release of Plasma 5.26, which has benefited from a significant

00:22.080 --> 00:24.080
focus on stability.

00:24.080 --> 00:30.720
Yeah, stability, and there is also a lot new in this release, add-ons or plasmoids, widgets,

00:30.720 --> 00:35.240
whatever you call them. They got a lot of work in this release, from some totally new

00:35.240 --> 00:39.980
ones to just improving long-standing ones, like the calendar and the clock. And something

00:39.980 --> 00:42.600
that jumped out at me that I think a lot of you are going to like, because I know it's

00:42.600 --> 00:49.340
one of your favorites, Kate and K-Write have now been spruced up with a fancy new welcome

00:49.340 --> 00:53.200
window that launches if you start the application without any files open.

00:53.200 --> 00:59.480
Well, we always like to see some bug fixing in these releases, and 5.26 is no slouch in

00:59.480 --> 01:05.640
that category. System settings no longer sometimes crashes when you navigate away from the Thunderbolt

01:05.640 --> 01:12.800
page. In the Plasma X11 session in particular, if Kwin happens to crash and gets auto-restarted

01:12.800 --> 01:19.060
or you manually restart it, it no longer loses its mappings of windows to activities, which

01:19.060 --> 01:21.960
is a big pain to fix.

01:21.960 --> 01:27.320
And the team also fixed an issue that could occasionally cause apps like VLC and Firefox

01:27.320 --> 01:32.440
to stop refreshing after being used for a little while, plus a whole lot more that we'll

01:32.440 --> 01:35.120
have linked in the show notes.

01:35.120 --> 01:40.400
And it might surprise some of you, but there are folks out there that actually have plasma

01:40.400 --> 01:45.560
hooked up to their TV. It can be pretty handy as a media home and a server all-in-one kind

01:45.560 --> 01:50.300
of setup. And they've put some serious work in this release for their big screen experience

01:50.300 --> 01:55.040
with two new apps landing, Aurora, which is a web browser designed for the big screen,

01:55.040 --> 02:00.920
and Plank, an easy to use media player, you guessed it, for the big screen.

02:00.920 --> 02:05.800
I've upgraded my Neon Station that I'm sitting at right now to do the show, and just like

02:05.800 --> 02:12.360
so many of these later 5 series plasma releases, the upgrade went super smooth. I kept all

02:12.360 --> 02:16.420
of my settings. It was really no big deal at all. In fact, if I hadn't intentionally

02:16.420 --> 02:20.920
gone to do the update and seen all the packages upgrade, I might not even know I was on the

02:20.920 --> 02:26.280
new version. When you go looking for things, you can find it, but the Neon betas have just

02:26.280 --> 02:31.320
been really smooth for me recently. And I have a sense that when Plasma 526 lands in

02:31.320 --> 02:35.840
distributions out there in the Linux world, people are really going to like this release.

02:35.840 --> 02:43.760
Well, you better keep that apt update handy over there, Chris, or really PKCon, I suppose.

02:43.760 --> 02:49.980
Either way, work is beginning right now on Plasma 527, which the project says will be

02:49.980 --> 02:58.240
the final feature release in the Plasma 5 series.

02:58.240 --> 03:03.360
Less than just two weeks after Google announced plans to shut down Stadia, its cloud gaming

03:03.360 --> 03:09.280
platform, Google has announced plans for Chromebooks built for cloud gaming platforms.

03:09.280 --> 03:17.520
Well, for as much sense as that makes, Google says the Acer Chromebook 516GE, the Asus Chromebook

03:17.520 --> 03:25.480
Vive CX55 Flip, and Lenovo's IdeaPad gaming Chromebook all have refresh rates of at least

03:25.480 --> 03:34.440
120Hz, displays with up to 1600p resolution, and WiFi 6.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.920
These units, what we used to call laptops, are now called Chromebooks, and they don't

03:37.920 --> 03:43.480
really have any dedicated graphics cards in them per se, and they don't really seem to

03:43.480 --> 03:48.640
be related to the recent efforts we reported on to get Steam working locally on Chromebooks.

03:48.640 --> 03:55.680
Instead, these units are equipped with modern Intel GPUs, so you could play some light gaming,

03:55.680 --> 03:59.400
but clearly the focus is on cloud gaming.

03:59.400 --> 04:04.000
They even emphasize WiFi 6 and quad phonic speakers for cloud gaming.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.080
It's just someone else's cloud gaming.

04:07.080 --> 04:11.480
But some of these might make a great little Linux machine.

04:11.480 --> 04:16.040
That Lenovo IdeaPad in particular, well it starts under 600 bucks.

04:16.040 --> 04:25.440
It has a 16 inch 120Hz display, a 12th gen Intel CPU, 512GB of SSD backed storage, 11

04:25.440 --> 04:31.680
hours of battery life, at least under Chrome OS, and it's only 4 pounds.

04:31.680 --> 04:37.160
So if the community could find a quick way to wipe off Chrome OS and load a nice shiny

04:37.160 --> 04:46.880
Linux distribution, it might just be a cheap way to snap up a pretty nice rig.

04:46.880 --> 04:54.540
Well speaking of mostly acceptable gaming performance, the Intel Arc A770 and the A750

04:54.540 --> 05:00.900
have gone on actual official sale in various global markets this week, with price points

05:00.900 --> 05:04.720
starting around $289 US greenbacks.

05:04.720 --> 05:10.920
Gnir and Asrock have also announced their takes on the Arc graphics cards, though sadly

05:10.920 --> 05:15.040
they're entirely out of stock as we record.

05:15.040 --> 05:20.920
Linux users in particular are pretty excited about this release, because the driver for

05:20.920 --> 05:28.100
this discrete GPU is built off Intel's existing open source integrated graphics driver stack.

05:28.100 --> 05:32.680
And as we've been reporting over the recent years, well there's been a lot of refactoring

05:32.680 --> 05:37.520
there to introduce the concept of discrete video memory and other features that you really

05:37.520 --> 05:40.880
only have to think about with a discrete GPU.

05:40.880 --> 05:47.540
Yeah, and Intel has been slowly but steadily building out the support at Linux for this,

05:47.540 --> 05:49.160
and I love seeing that.

05:49.160 --> 05:54.120
A free software driver stack for the video is just massive for Linux, but they're competing

05:54.120 --> 05:55.120
on price here too.

05:55.120 --> 06:02.480
The lower end RTX 4070 is still a couple hundred dollars more than the starting Intel Arc GPU.

06:02.480 --> 06:07.980
And I can already hear you guys saying, yeah, they're not really comparable.

06:07.980 --> 06:11.240
The RTX is still going to be a better gaming card and that kind of stuff.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.960
And I think you're probably right, and it's going to be a little bit probably till they're

06:13.960 --> 06:17.560
totally equivalent in that arena.

06:17.560 --> 06:23.440
But when it comes to just workstation day-to-day desktop use and experience, I bet they are

06:23.440 --> 06:26.520
a little bit more equivalent, and the benchmarks are starting to show that out.

06:26.520 --> 06:31.960
Of course, our buddy Michael Larable over at Ferronix has been watching this story closely.

06:31.960 --> 06:36.720
But I, as a longtime Linux user, I find this really compelling to have another open source

06:36.720 --> 06:40.280
driver stack option for a Linux GPU.

06:40.280 --> 06:48.320
This is something we'll keep an eye on and report back any interesting details that develop.

06:48.320 --> 06:54.520
This week, Canonical launched a free tier of their Ubuntu Pro commercial offering.

06:54.520 --> 06:59.960
Ubuntu Pro is a subscription security maintenance and compliance program initially designed

06:59.960 --> 07:07.400
for enterprise customers who want long-term stability for their infrastructure and applications.

07:07.400 --> 07:12.440
Ubuntu Pro is somewhat ideal for that use case since the more you pay, seemingly the

07:12.440 --> 07:14.200
less you need to upgrade.

07:14.200 --> 07:21.240
Now, however, Canonical decided to expand Ubuntu Pro for personal and small-scale commercial

07:21.240 --> 07:26.320
use with a free tier for up to five machines.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.960
And as Mark Shuttleworth points out, this program doesn't impose the restrictions on

07:30.960 --> 07:35.520
types of users that other enterprise distribution providers do.

07:35.520 --> 07:42.640
All of these programs cover the full distribution for up to 10 years with the option to extend

07:42.640 --> 07:45.800
beyond that for industrial use cases.

07:45.800 --> 07:51.880
And I'm very pleased to say that we are making all of that available free of charge to anybody

07:51.880 --> 07:53.720
with a personal subscription.

07:53.720 --> 08:00.240
It's not a student edition, it's not a developer-only edition, it is full commercial use for you

08:00.240 --> 08:29.680
and any business you own on up to five machines.

08:30.680 --> 08:33.080
You guys know me, it was kind of like one of the top reasons.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.880
I first discovered Linode at a Linux fest and I could tell they were one of the few

08:36.880 --> 08:41.000
vendors actually in it because they were geeking out about Linux.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.080
Some of the other vendors were not taking it very seriously and you know, I was just

08:44.080 --> 08:48.640
looking at their calendar, chatting with my buds over at Linode and they've got a lot

08:48.640 --> 08:51.000
coming up in the fall.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.640
They're going to be at a bunch of different events.

08:52.640 --> 08:56.020
I'll put a link in the show notes so that way if you're going to be at one of these,

08:56.020 --> 09:00.680
you can say hi, like Hashicomf in Los Angeles coming up right now.

09:00.680 --> 09:02.600
Actually just finished, so scratch that one.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.880
Sastok though, that's coming up, KubeCon, CompTIA, EMA, that's coming up at the end

09:06.880 --> 09:08.080
of the month.

09:08.080 --> 09:11.800
Web Summit next month, IT Nation Connect also coming up.

09:11.800 --> 09:16.560
The Caribbean Developers Conference, how do I get it on that one?

09:16.560 --> 09:19.000
I want to go to the Caribbean, that sounds great.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.560
I mean, they're all over the place, they're always trying to engage and interact with

09:21.560 --> 09:22.560
the community.

09:22.560 --> 09:28.120
That's why they supported our road trip events because they get that Linux, it's made by

09:28.120 --> 09:29.800
the community.

09:29.800 --> 09:33.720
It's worth investing in that layer and then you build out a really great business on top

09:33.720 --> 09:36.720
of that technology platform that the community builds for you.

09:36.720 --> 09:40.440
They've always gotten that concept and so that's why they've invested in these areas

09:40.440 --> 09:46.760
and areas like support and making the UI really work and of course, performance, so fast.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.280
They've got 11 data centers to choose from.

09:48.280 --> 09:51.700
They're adding a dozen, over a dozen next year as well.

09:51.700 --> 09:57.480
They are their own ISP on top of all of that and they really have no reason to not work

09:57.480 --> 10:03.240
with any kind of configuration management tool that you want, Chef, Puppet, Ansible,

10:03.240 --> 10:06.660
whatever it is, the Terraforms, yeah, you got that.

10:06.660 --> 10:07.660
They have no reason not to.

10:07.660 --> 10:10.680
They want to be your alternative cloud if that's what you need.

10:10.680 --> 10:13.300
They want to be your primary cloud if that's what you need.

10:13.300 --> 10:17.000
They want to just run whatever simple application you might need.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.040
They try to do all of it and they try to do it better than anybody else and I think they

10:20.040 --> 10:21.040
nail it.

10:21.040 --> 10:24.400
So that's truly what keeps me as a customer and why I keep building over there.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.880
It's nice to know that support's available if you ever need it.

10:26.880 --> 10:31.060
So if you go get that $100 at linode.com slash LAN, you can really try this stuff.

10:31.060 --> 10:36.460
You can see the actual pricing and really get a sense of how it works and I think once

10:36.460 --> 10:41.180
you start to do that, you'll start to see the competitive advantages for yourself.

10:41.180 --> 10:45.720
So go build something, go learn something, go try something while you support the show.

10:45.720 --> 10:51.300
Just go to linode.com slash LAN, get that $100 for the best place on the internet to

10:51.300 --> 10:52.440
run your applications.

10:52.440 --> 10:57.260
I mean the best place to host your services, your applications, and to get a full Linux

10:57.260 --> 11:03.720
box, linode.com slash LAN.

11:03.720 --> 11:08.900
And a big thank you to my friends over at Kalyde, Kalyde.com slash LAN.

11:08.900 --> 11:13.040
Kalyde is an endpoint security solution that uses the most powerful untapped resource in

11:13.040 --> 11:16.200
IT, the end users.

11:16.200 --> 11:20.320
When you're trying to achieve security, maybe it's something you've set for yourself as

11:20.320 --> 11:25.320
a goal, maybe it's a third party audit, maybe you have a new boss in town.

11:25.320 --> 11:29.640
There's been so many ways that companies, businesses, organizations, schools, what have

11:29.640 --> 11:30.640
you have tried this.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.040
I've seen a lot of it over the years.

11:33.040 --> 11:36.720
Conventional wisdom was just to treat every device like it's Fort Knox.

11:36.720 --> 11:42.560
You just go all in on like just this really old school draconian device management, MDMs

11:42.560 --> 11:47.640
that force disruptive agents onto employees' devices, slow down performance, and they often

11:47.640 --> 11:50.040
treat privacy as an afterthought.

11:50.040 --> 11:54.800
That was just an awful way of doing things because it makes a bad experience for the

11:54.800 --> 12:01.240
end user which kind of pits them against IT and does not create the best atmosphere, sort

12:01.240 --> 12:03.560
of makes them enemies.

12:03.560 --> 12:05.560
And also creates its own security problems.

12:05.560 --> 12:10.760
It often also results in sort of a shadow IT structure just so the employees can quote

12:10.760 --> 12:12.720
do their jobs.

12:12.720 --> 12:14.520
Kalyde does things differently.

12:14.520 --> 12:20.960
Instead of forcing changes on users, Kalyde sends them security recommendations via Slack.

12:20.960 --> 12:24.960
Kalyde will automatically notify your team when their devices are insecure and it'll

12:24.960 --> 12:29.820
give them step-by-step instructions on how to solve the problem.

12:29.820 --> 12:33.500
And by reaching out to employees just with a friendly Slack DM and educating them about

12:33.500 --> 12:38.900
company policies, Kalyde can help you build a culture for which everyone is contributing

12:38.900 --> 12:46.120
to security because, well, everyone understands how and why to do it.

12:46.120 --> 12:49.760
For IT admins, Kalyde provides a single dashboard that lets you monitor the security of your

12:49.760 --> 12:50.760
entire fleet.

12:50.760 --> 12:53.880
It supports Mac, Windows, and of course, Linux desktops.

12:53.880 --> 12:58.760
So you can see at a glance which employees have their disks encrypted, their OS up to

12:58.760 --> 13:01.280
date, and a password manager installed.

13:01.280 --> 13:05.760
Making it easy to prove compliance to your auditors, customers, and leadership.

13:05.760 --> 13:11.240
So that's Kalyde, user-centered cross-platform endpoint security for teams that Slack.

13:11.240 --> 13:15.120
You can meet your compliance goals by putting users first.

13:15.120 --> 13:19.640
Just visit Kalyde.com slash LAN to find out how.

13:19.640 --> 13:23.200
When you go there and you sign up for a free trial, they'll hook you up with a goody bag,

13:23.200 --> 13:25.200
a real goody bag with a free t-shirt inside.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.720
I do love me a free t-shirt.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.120
That's just for activating a free trial and checking it out.

13:30.120 --> 13:39.320
So it's K-O-L-I-D-E dot com slash LAN, Kalyde dot com slash LAN.

13:39.320 --> 13:43.920
We wanted to wrap things up this week with a little heads up.

13:43.920 --> 13:51.680
Mulvad VPN has discovered that Android leaks traffic every time the device connects to

13:51.680 --> 13:53.720
a Wi-Fi network.

13:53.720 --> 14:00.280
Imagine if the block connections without VPN or always-on VPN features are enabled.

14:00.280 --> 14:05.880
The data that makes it outside your VPN tunnels includes source IP addresses, DNS lookups,

14:05.880 --> 14:10.680
HTTPS traffic, and likely also some NTP traffic.

14:10.680 --> 14:15.960
Yeah, Android does things like check for a captive portal every time you connect to a

14:15.960 --> 14:18.040
new Wi-Fi AP.

14:18.040 --> 14:21.860
It tries to determine if the user needs help to get fully connected.

14:21.860 --> 14:25.620
This is by design, Android was built this way.

14:25.620 --> 14:30.080
It is a choice by Google just to make things easier for users.

14:30.080 --> 14:34.240
But I think anyone really familiar with Network Unity knows this, you're going to inevitably

14:34.240 --> 14:39.360
reveal details about yourself and your machine if you go out and probe the state of the network

14:39.360 --> 14:42.600
and try to find the edge devices.

14:42.600 --> 14:47.920
And to make this worse, I think most developers and users probably had the wrong idea about

14:47.920 --> 14:54.120
what block connections without VPN exactly meant here, especially compounded by poor

14:54.120 --> 14:58.800
Android documentation that inaccurately describes the feature.

14:58.800 --> 15:04.080
Yeah, that's where you could almost fry some conspiracy bacon with this story.

15:04.080 --> 15:10.100
The wording around the feature in the Android OS sort of implies that everything gets blocked

15:10.100 --> 15:13.480
if a VPN is turned on, it only goes through that tunnel.

15:13.480 --> 15:18.240
And I've experienced this setting by accident when I first installed TailScale.

15:18.240 --> 15:21.560
And I had it set to tunnel everything through VPN, and that's not how TailScale works.

15:21.560 --> 15:25.760
And so nothing worked, at least that I knew of, I didn't realize it was leaking information

15:25.760 --> 15:27.120
at the time.

15:27.120 --> 15:31.380
But then we're like, you could see someone getting conspiratorial here is you go read

15:31.380 --> 15:34.560
the documentation for Android developers.

15:34.560 --> 15:39.640
And they also really make it sound like nothing gets out.

15:39.640 --> 15:43.600
And maybe the people writing the documentation just didn't understand the nuances of what

15:43.600 --> 15:45.120
was happening there.

15:45.120 --> 15:49.160
Maybe it's a right hand not talking to the left hand kind of thing.

15:49.160 --> 15:53.280
I mean, as an example, you can take Graphene OS, there's an option in there where the user

15:53.280 --> 15:56.240
can toggle that check.

15:56.240 --> 15:59.480
If they toggle it, so the check doesn't happen.

15:59.480 --> 16:04.140
The researchers did not observe Graphene OS leaking this information that simple setting

16:04.140 --> 16:10.160
that Graphene OS exposes that gives the user control seems to fix this issue.

16:10.160 --> 16:14.080
Mulvad just simply discovered this because they were conducting their own audit of their

16:14.080 --> 16:19.240
own apps, trying to figure out why it seemed like their app was leaking information when

16:19.240 --> 16:20.240
it was on the network.

16:20.240 --> 16:24.560
And it turned out it wasn't an issue with the Mulvad VPN at all.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.840
It was an issue with Android.

16:27.840 --> 16:33.400
Now of course, the core privacy concern here is that that connection check traffic, well,

16:33.400 --> 16:38.880
it can be observed and analyzed both by the party controlling the connectivity check server,

16:38.880 --> 16:43.140
but also anyone else on the network path between.

16:43.140 --> 16:48.360
And even if the content of the message itself doesn't reveal anything more than some Android

16:48.360 --> 16:55.160
devices connecting to this network, the metadata, which includes the source IP address, well,

16:55.160 --> 16:59.880
that can be used to derive further information, especially if you combine that with other

16:59.880 --> 17:03.480
data such as Wi-Fi access point locations.

17:03.480 --> 17:09.840
Unfortunately, it seems iOS users, well, they're in the same boat, if not a boat that's a little

17:09.840 --> 17:12.640
bit more leaky.

17:12.640 --> 17:18.880
A security researcher back in August found a significant flaw in iOS VPN apps and a second

17:18.880 --> 17:23.720
researcher has now demonstrated another major issue.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.320
Details in the show notes for that one.

17:25.320 --> 17:30.240
Yeah, a bit more leaky indeed, some of that second research shows that a lot of Apple's

17:30.240 --> 17:35.000
core apps, they just bypass your VPN if things aren't working right, cause they want to talk

17:35.000 --> 17:36.000
to the home server.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
They don't care.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.080
So you're leaking even more metadata in those circumstances.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.200
That's definitely worth reading.

17:42.200 --> 17:46.440
You know, the situation here is sort of unfixable by the VPN vendors.

17:46.440 --> 17:49.720
There's nothing Mulvad can do to solve this problem.

17:49.720 --> 17:54.720
It's a limitation of how these OSs are built, at least the stock OSs, which is what most

17:54.720 --> 17:56.320
users are going to use.

17:56.320 --> 18:00.600
Mulvad has submitted their suggestions to revise the documentation around the block

18:00.600 --> 18:05.480
connections feature, just to make it more clear what data is still being sent outside

18:05.480 --> 18:06.880
the VPN at least.

18:06.880 --> 18:11.860
Yeah, they have a pretty nice write up, which we'll have linked in the docs.

18:11.860 --> 18:18.600
And in that they end on a pretty simple recommendation, quote, as a closing note, we would like to

18:18.600 --> 18:25.880
recommend Google adopt the ability to disable connectivity checks like on Graphene OS into

18:25.880 --> 18:27.880
stock Android.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.200
Yeah.

18:29.200 --> 18:36.360
From their fingers to Google's ears, I guess it just seems like a relatively easy solution.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.960
If they wanted to, they could even just probably get the code from Graphene OS.

18:39.960 --> 18:43.000
And if they wanted to impress us with their development prowess, they could create it

18:43.000 --> 18:44.000
from scratch.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.760
I'd be happy with either one.

18:45.760 --> 18:50.760
Just add a user controlled option to let us check for captive portals or not.

18:50.760 --> 18:52.800
Just let us have control over that setting.

18:52.800 --> 19:00.920
I have to say, if you have a pixel, Graphene OS has just really exceeded all my expectations.

19:00.920 --> 19:06.080
I have kind of ended up using it in a somewhat compromised way because I do have the play

19:06.080 --> 19:11.560
API and the play store on there, but Graphene OS allows you to use them in a sandbox way.

19:11.560 --> 19:15.640
It's extremely clever and very effective.

19:15.640 --> 19:19.560
Now the mainstream commercial operating systems, they're always likely to err on the side of

19:19.560 --> 19:21.360
convenience over privacy.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.400
You kind of have to pick one.

19:23.400 --> 19:28.840
And I think if you'd prefer things to bend a bit more towards the privacy side, and you

19:28.840 --> 19:33.240
can get your hands on some pixel hardware, I have to highly recommend giving Graphene

19:33.240 --> 19:34.660
OS a try.

19:34.660 --> 19:37.440
It might just exceed your expectations too.

19:37.440 --> 19:41.800
But if the situation with the commercial OSes ever improves, well, of course we'll let you

19:41.800 --> 19:42.800
know.

19:42.800 --> 19:47.480
With all of that and everything else happening in the world of Linux and open source, go

19:47.480 --> 19:52.560
to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

19:52.560 --> 19:57.520
And linuxactionnews.com slash contact to let us know your source IP address so we don't

19:57.520 --> 20:00.900
have to rely on the leaks.

20:00.900 --> 20:05.040
If you haven't checked out our PeerTube instance, head over to jupyter.tube.

20:05.040 --> 20:07.920
You can see how we make some of our podcasts.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.220
Just not this year's show.

20:09.220 --> 20:10.960
That's top secret.

20:10.960 --> 20:11.960
Don't worry though.

20:11.960 --> 20:13.480
We'll keep it secret in the back end.

20:13.480 --> 20:19.040
But only until next week when we'll be back with our take on the latest Linux and open

20:19.040 --> 20:20.800
source news.

20:20.800 --> 20:42.960
Thanks for joining us and that's all the news for this week.
