Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.400 --> 00:20.240
This is episode seven, recorded on June 25th, 2017.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.240
I'm Chris.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.240
And I'm Joe.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.240
Hello, Joe.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.560
This week, big week for Linux graphics.

00:25.560 --> 00:29.080
Multimedia on Linux got some big news, and we're going to dig into some of it.

00:29.080 --> 00:32.560
But let's start with the Ubuntu desktop weekly update.

00:32.560 --> 00:36.400
This is something that's been happening on a regular basis, and there's a few juicy nuggets

00:36.400 --> 00:37.400
in here.

00:37.400 --> 00:38.760
Yeah, there are a couple of things here.

00:38.760 --> 00:43.880
The first one is that Unity 7 is going to be in 17.10.

00:43.880 --> 00:48.660
At least it's going to be available as an option to install, which they are currently

00:48.660 --> 00:52.020
working on in the daily images.

00:52.020 --> 00:58.960
So you can now get Unity 7 as well as GNOME, which is obviously the default.

00:58.960 --> 01:00.280
And that's not huge news.

01:00.280 --> 01:03.800
We kind of expected this, but it is good to see because there are a lot of people who

01:03.800 --> 01:05.720
are going to miss Unity.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.180
And it's not Unity 8.

01:07.180 --> 01:08.180
It's not the mere stuff.

01:08.180 --> 01:12.520
It's not all the convergence stuff that we were hoping for.

01:12.520 --> 01:17.120
But it is good old trusty Unity 7, which I personally am not a huge fan of.

01:17.120 --> 01:21.500
But I know that probably listening to the show are thousands of people who are using

01:21.500 --> 01:27.800
Unity on a daily basis and are really sad to see it go and will reluctantly switch to

01:27.800 --> 01:28.800
GNOME.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.440
So this is going to make that transition that little bit easier, isn't it?

01:31.440 --> 01:32.440
Absolutely.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.960
So the big takeaway from this bit is you're going to be able to have both GNOME and the

01:35.960 --> 01:39.080
Unity desktop session side by side.

01:39.080 --> 01:43.620
So what they did here was they migrated Ubuntu session to GNOME, and now they've created

01:43.620 --> 01:45.260
a new Unity session.

01:45.260 --> 01:48.260
So now we have two separate sessions that will be available at the login screen if you

01:48.260 --> 01:50.420
install all the corresponding packages.

01:50.420 --> 01:56.760
And in traditional open source geek style, I am now loving Unity 7 more than ever now

01:56.760 --> 01:58.080
that they've announced they're killing it.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.900
But I want to talk about the update in here that I think is going to have a huge impact

02:00.900 --> 02:04.560
long term on multimedia playback on the Linux desktop.

02:04.560 --> 02:09.840
They're working on hardware accelerated video decoding and a proof of concept using Gstreamer.

02:09.840 --> 02:18.480
Yeah, and this is going to mean potentially 4K H.264 video using only 3% of a CPU if you've

02:18.480 --> 02:23.240
got Haswell or newer, which is amazing, isn't it?

02:23.240 --> 02:29.560
At the moment, if you're trying to run 4K video, it uses a ton of CPU and your computer

02:29.560 --> 02:34.560
can't really do much else unless it is ridiculously fat and beefy.

02:34.560 --> 02:37.120
So that is amazing.

02:37.120 --> 02:43.120
And 4K H.265 will be available on Skylake or later.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.800
That's good timing for that because that's going to get more and more implementation

02:45.800 --> 02:46.800
over 2018.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.580
Yeah, this, I can't really understate this.

02:49.580 --> 02:50.760
This is huge.

02:50.760 --> 02:54.720
In my benchmarking, I recently had some just unbelievably powerful Linux hardware in the

02:54.720 --> 02:55.880
studio for benchmarking.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.720
So very fresh results.

02:57.720 --> 03:03.880
I was able to get smoother, better playback on a 2013 MacBook Pro than on the most latest

03:03.880 --> 03:11.400
totally high end Linux workstation with Xeon CPUs, workstation grade graphics, PCIe storage.

03:11.400 --> 03:19.740
It struggled to play back 60 frames per second 4K H.264 video while the MacBook Pro 2013

03:19.740 --> 03:23.040
could smoke through the footage because of hardware acceleration.

03:23.040 --> 03:26.580
And this is becoming a limiting factor for video editors on Linux.

03:26.580 --> 03:30.200
And so it's great to see Canonical doing this in Ubuntu because even just being able to

03:30.200 --> 03:32.320
play back the footage is a huge win.

03:32.320 --> 03:37.080
So you think that this is going to feed into video editors, potentially Kdenlive and that

03:37.080 --> 03:38.080
sort of thing?

03:38.080 --> 03:39.200
I certainly hope so.

03:39.200 --> 03:43.420
They all have different ways of utilizing system codecs, but a huge part of being able

03:43.420 --> 03:47.000
to work with the footage on the Linux desktop is the fact that it just struggles to even

03:47.000 --> 03:49.500
play it back, let alone edit it.

03:49.500 --> 03:52.800
So this will fix the play it back aspect of it.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.720
So if you check the link in the show notes, you can figure out how to get it working now

03:55.720 --> 03:57.280
on your system.

03:57.280 --> 04:00.880
But the plan is to hopefully have this land in 1710.

04:00.880 --> 04:04.260
It's all proof of concept right now, but you can tell I'm watching this with some serious

04:04.260 --> 04:05.260
interest.

04:05.260 --> 04:10.280
Yeah, let's hope that it's working and completely stable in 1804, the next LTS.

04:10.280 --> 04:14.320
And I really hope that other distros can take this work and implement it there as well.

04:14.320 --> 04:19.880
I'm going to see if I can't retrofit my review and install this proof of concept and do an

04:19.880 --> 04:24.440
A-B difference between software accelerated playback and hardware accelerated, although

04:24.440 --> 04:26.840
I bet our audience knows it's a huge difference.

04:26.840 --> 04:27.840
Yeah.

04:27.840 --> 04:34.760
Okay, well, something that I wanted to quickly flag up was the Foronix 2017 Linux Laptop Survey,

04:34.760 --> 04:41.080
which is only a few questions on Google Form, but I think that it's important to have our

04:41.080 --> 04:47.320
say as a Linux community on what we want from a Linux laptop and what we've got now.

04:47.320 --> 04:55.080
And the information that you can give them anonymously is potentially going to help the

04:55.080 --> 04:56.080
market out.

04:56.080 --> 05:00.280
It's going to prove that we want certain things and certain things are important.

05:00.280 --> 05:06.840
Is battery life more important to you or performance or build quality, that sort of thing?

05:06.840 --> 05:12.000
There's loads of questions here and I've taken the survey and so I think everyone should

05:12.000 --> 05:16.960
do that and hopefully the industry can take note of the results.

05:16.960 --> 05:21.160
So not only is this going to be useful for manufacturers creating laptops, but I'm interested

05:21.160 --> 05:23.780
in it from a Linux user's perspective.

05:23.780 --> 05:29.880
Are people going with pre-built Linux rigs, shipping with Linux, or are they still blazing

05:29.880 --> 05:34.180
their own trail and buying hardware that isn't necessarily designed for Linux, but making

05:34.180 --> 05:35.180
it work?

05:35.180 --> 05:37.640
I think this survey will suss that out as well.

05:37.640 --> 05:40.840
And then it's also asking people, like, what kind of issues do you run into these days

05:40.840 --> 05:42.080
with your trackpad?

05:42.080 --> 05:44.120
Are you trying to put these on Macbooks?

05:44.120 --> 05:48.240
They're also trying to suss out things like touchpad issues, Wi-Fi, and battery life like

05:48.240 --> 05:52.840
Joe mentioned, but something else that caught my attention in the survey, this is the first

05:52.840 --> 05:55.360
time I've seen Solus show up on the survey.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.640
I'm really going to be interested to see what the results are that come back on that.

05:58.640 --> 06:02.180
The other thing I like about this is, first of all, Feronix is sort of a neutral third

06:02.180 --> 06:03.180
party in this.

06:03.180 --> 06:07.320
They don't build a laptop, they don't sell any hardware, and they have a pretty solid

06:07.320 --> 06:12.160
background with open benchmarking, where some of this might be interesting to cross-connect

06:12.160 --> 06:16.440
the data of the results from the survey with the machines that have been benchmarked on

06:16.440 --> 06:21.000
open benchmark, and maybe we could kind of get a sense of the average compute power of

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
the Linux community.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
At least they're laptops.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.100
Yeah, yeah.

06:25.100 --> 06:29.400
So the last question is, what would you like to see in a dream Linux laptop?

06:29.400 --> 06:31.680
So I'll have to ask, what did you put for that one?

06:31.680 --> 06:36.880
I don't know if I actually answered that question, because the XPS 13 and the Galago Pros out

06:36.880 --> 06:38.840
there, they're getting pretty damn close.

06:38.840 --> 06:43.800
And I kind of feel now with the XPS 13 in particular, they just keep revving on that,

06:43.800 --> 06:47.640
and it's pretty close to perfect within today's market realities.

06:47.640 --> 06:54.840
Okay, because I said 100% FOSS, including the BIOS, that is the dream for me.

06:54.840 --> 06:55.840
You idealist, Joe.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.920
Well, you've got a dream, haven't you?

06:57.920 --> 06:59.240
I totally agree.

06:59.240 --> 07:03.180
And if I was dreaming, I would say yes.

07:03.180 --> 07:07.520
When I think of the ideal Linux laptop, I think of one I can actually buy en masse today.

07:07.520 --> 07:11.320
That's kind of what I think of, and there's just some compromises.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.160
Now ask me again in five years, maybe it would be a different answer.

07:14.160 --> 07:17.440
Well, they said dream, so I dream big.

07:17.440 --> 07:18.560
What can I say?

07:18.560 --> 07:23.920
Speaking of dreams, some of those dreams got crushed when Yala failed to deliver a tablet

07:23.920 --> 07:25.920
running their alternative OS.

07:25.920 --> 07:30.000
We have a bit of an update for those of you still waiting for your refund, and it looks

07:30.000 --> 07:32.240
like some good news for Yala down the road too.

07:32.240 --> 07:38.720
Yeah, this was a tablet that they promised to ship by the second quarter of 2015, and

07:38.720 --> 07:43.520
the crowd funder for it was in early 2015.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.160
And they ran out of money.

07:46.160 --> 07:51.600
The investments that they were promised never materialized, and they almost went bankrupt.

07:51.600 --> 07:57.000
And so they promised to refund people's money.

07:57.000 --> 08:02.920
Well they refunded about half of people's money and then promised that they would give

08:02.920 --> 08:05.920
them the other half at some point.

08:05.920 --> 08:15.600
Well we've now had a post on their blog saying basically that they are still hoping to give

08:15.600 --> 08:20.720
people their refunds but making no promises, which it just doesn't look good.

08:20.720 --> 08:21.720
It's awkward.

08:21.720 --> 08:22.720
It's really awkward.

08:22.720 --> 08:23.880
So this has been a few years in now.

08:23.880 --> 08:30.160
I mean I remember covering this back in, I mean years ago, 2015 earlier in the Linux

08:30.160 --> 08:31.160
action show.

08:31.160 --> 08:36.440
And so now here we are in Linux action news and we're getting to the news of the refunds.

08:36.440 --> 08:42.960
Now it starts, like I said, awkwardly because they go into how things are going good because

08:42.960 --> 08:51.000
they're making positive progress towards major business deals with Sailfish in China and

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Russia.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.480
Yeah, which is their business model now, licensing out Sailfish OS.

08:55.480 --> 08:56.800
Yeah, yeah.

08:56.800 --> 09:01.800
And if those projects go big time, like they think they might, then they're going to start

09:01.800 --> 09:04.160
having a steady income of money.

09:04.160 --> 09:09.720
And they think once that happens, then they're going to stabilize their business over time.

09:09.720 --> 09:15.920
And once these things start to coalesce, they then plan to come up with a way of giving

09:15.920 --> 09:21.080
a cut of the revenues back towards the customers who funded them.

09:21.080 --> 09:25.640
So they say they're going to take a phased approach to refund and they're going to execute

09:25.640 --> 09:30.840
refunds every month the company makes a positive cash flow from its core business, Sailfish

09:30.840 --> 09:32.200
OS licensing.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.740
Let's parse that for a second.

09:33.740 --> 09:38.680
They're going to execute refunds every month that the company makes positive cash flow.

09:38.680 --> 09:43.400
So not every month, but just every month that they have positive cash flow from its core

09:43.400 --> 09:45.200
business, which is Sailfish.

09:45.200 --> 09:51.440
So if they start swag or business consulting or integration services with hardware manufacturers,

09:51.440 --> 09:55.280
those separate revenue streams are not applicable to this deal.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.360
Yeah.

09:56.360 --> 10:02.480
And also they're going to give out these refunds randomly, which doesn't seem right.

10:02.480 --> 10:05.680
Maybe they should do it in the order that people pledged.

10:05.680 --> 10:09.720
If you jump straight on it, maybe you should get your refund before people who pledged

10:09.720 --> 10:10.720
after you.

10:10.720 --> 10:14.400
Now let me play devil's advocate here.

10:14.400 --> 10:18.400
In a world where everybody wants to see a strong Android competitor and wants to see

10:18.400 --> 10:23.840
something like Sailfish OS be successful, we have to acknowledge that the company that

10:23.840 --> 10:27.320
is driving that the strongest has to be successful.

10:27.320 --> 10:32.640
And we don't want to bleed them dry with refunds because the money that they are refunding

10:32.640 --> 10:37.440
is truly from fans who wanted to see this be successful in the long term anyway.

10:37.440 --> 10:41.960
People who are willing to go in on Indiegogo are doing so because they believe in the vision

10:41.960 --> 10:44.600
or the mission of the thing they're backing.

10:44.600 --> 10:50.180
In this case, Sailfish OS or Yala, you get my drift here.

10:50.180 --> 10:55.960
In some sense, they can afford to trickle refund their biggest fans because those biggest

10:55.960 --> 10:58.520
fans have a core belief in the bigger vision.

10:58.520 --> 10:59.640
I suppose so.

10:59.640 --> 11:04.280
And ultimately, I would like to see it succeed because of all of the various mobile operating

11:04.280 --> 11:08.760
systems that I've tried, I think that Sailfish is the best.

11:08.760 --> 11:16.280
I used it for a couple of weeks when Martin Wimpress, Wimpy lent me his old Yala phone

11:16.280 --> 11:20.420
and I was really impressed with it and that was a good couple of years ago.

11:20.420 --> 11:25.640
So I can only assume, I haven't actually tried it out for a while, but I can only assume

11:25.640 --> 11:29.320
that it is much better now and it was already really good then.

11:29.320 --> 11:32.880
So I really want them to succeed and I suppose, yeah, that you don't want them to be bled

11:32.880 --> 11:33.880
dry.

11:33.880 --> 11:39.640
That is a good point that if they liquidated all their assets and just basically bankrupted

11:39.640 --> 11:43.880
themselves by paying back these backers on Indiegogo.

11:43.880 --> 11:44.880
The dream's dead.

11:44.880 --> 11:45.880
Yeah.

11:45.880 --> 11:50.960
And I suppose also, you're not buying something on Indiegogo, are you?

11:50.960 --> 11:55.840
You are pledging a donation and you get a reward for that, which there's no guarantee

11:55.840 --> 11:56.840
of.

11:56.840 --> 12:00.840
A tablet or anything like this on Indiegogo always seems like a moonshot to me.

12:00.840 --> 12:01.840
Yeah, I agree.

12:01.840 --> 12:05.960
I mean, I have a rule that I'm not going to put any money into crowdfunding that I can't

12:05.960 --> 12:07.360
afford to lose.

12:07.360 --> 12:15.360
And so that's why the GPD Pocket, for example, I really wanted it and stuff, but I just wasn't

12:15.360 --> 12:16.720
willing to risk the money.

12:16.720 --> 12:20.680
I think they will deliver and it's looking like they are starting to deliver that.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.320
But something that's a few hundred dollars.

12:23.320 --> 12:24.320
I completely echo that.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.440
I completely agree.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.200
That's now my philosophy with crowdfunding too.

12:27.200 --> 12:31.360
And honestly, Joe, it was some of these crowdfundings like the one that Yala did that sort of taught

12:31.360 --> 12:33.160
us those hard lessons.

12:33.160 --> 12:35.720
Yeah, exactly.

12:35.720 --> 12:40.280
But well, here's hoping that they do make some money and be successful.

12:40.280 --> 12:44.200
And as you say, be a genuine competitor to Android, even if it's not completely open

12:44.200 --> 12:45.200
source.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.000
Well, neither is Android.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.640
And if we had something that was really good and could compete with Android, at least in

12:53.640 --> 12:58.600
a niche of the market, that would be better than just having this duopoly that we've got

12:58.600 --> 13:02.200
now.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.340
Last.ting.com.

13:03.340 --> 13:08.600
That's where you go to support the show and get $25 off a device or $25 in Ting credit

13:08.600 --> 13:10.140
if you bring a device.

13:10.140 --> 13:15.180
I've been on the Ting network for years and one of the devices I ran was the Nexus 5 and

13:15.180 --> 13:16.960
I put Sailfish OS on there.

13:16.960 --> 13:20.420
This is what I love about Ting is they'll give you a GSM SIM, you put that in the device

13:20.420 --> 13:21.420
you want.

13:21.420 --> 13:24.840
And they have supported devices that their support people know all about.

13:24.840 --> 13:28.400
And of course, that's always a great way to go for anyone that's just looking for a simple

13:28.400 --> 13:29.880
to use cellular plan.

13:29.880 --> 13:30.880
But me?

13:30.880 --> 13:31.880
No, I got to make things hard.

13:31.880 --> 13:36.280
I got to flash ROMs on my Nexus 5 and Sailfish OS, it rocked because Ting doesn't have an

13:36.280 --> 13:37.280
agenda.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.280
They don't block certain OSs.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.000
They don't block updates to your phone.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.120
They just give you simple mobile for $6 a line.

13:44.120 --> 13:47.760
It's your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.320
Whatever you use, Ting adds it up and that's all you pay.

13:50.320 --> 13:55.600
Start by going to last.ting.com and get nationwide coverage with no contracts, no early termination

13:55.600 --> 13:57.580
fees, and you only pay for what you use.

13:57.580 --> 14:01.720
It's really how the mobile industry would do it today if they had to start all over.

14:01.720 --> 14:02.720
last.ting.com.

14:02.720 --> 14:07.440
Go there, also check out their blog, great post recently, last.ting.com and thanks to

14:07.440 --> 14:10.280
Ting for sponsoring the Linux Action News.

14:10.280 --> 14:20.120
Well, let's talk about Mozilla and firstly, Firefox Focus, their new browser for Android,

14:20.120 --> 14:25.160
which was available sort of iOS before, but we don't really care about that or at least

14:25.160 --> 14:26.160
I don't.

14:26.160 --> 14:29.160
I know you do.

14:29.160 --> 14:37.520
So it's a very simple little browser that is focused completely on privacy and by the

14:37.520 --> 14:41.600
looks of things, speed as well, because I tried this out today and that is the first

14:41.600 --> 14:42.700
thing that jumped out at me.

14:42.700 --> 14:46.480
This is the fastest browser I have ever used on Android.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.480
Really?

14:47.480 --> 14:48.480
That's cool.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.480
Yeah.

14:49.480 --> 14:52.520
So it allows you to browse the web and they say, quote unquote, without being tracked

14:52.520 --> 14:57.280
by ads and you know, it's funny you mentioned the speed.

14:57.280 --> 15:00.160
I was really curious, Joe, like how are they building this?

15:00.160 --> 15:07.000
Because this is Mozilla and on iOS, they really just kind of ended up wrapping WebKit and

15:07.000 --> 15:11.160
using that and that was like, it was essentially it was a WebKit browser, but with the Firefox

15:11.160 --> 15:15.660
Focus take on it, I thought, okay, well for Android, surely, surely they're using Gecko.

15:15.660 --> 15:19.440
And so I did a little digging and I dug around and I have a link in the show notes in the

15:19.440 --> 15:22.680
Firefox Focus source code.

15:22.680 --> 15:26.800
And it looks like at build time, they allow you to build it with either a Gecko back end

15:26.800 --> 15:29.480
or a WebKit back end.

15:29.480 --> 15:33.560
And for the version they're shipping on the Play Store, it's built with the WebKit back

15:33.560 --> 15:34.560
end.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.020
Actually, it's using Android WebView.

15:36.020 --> 15:37.020
So WebKit.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.020
Right.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.900
That explains why it's fast then.

15:39.900 --> 15:40.900
Isn't that interesting though?

15:40.900 --> 15:44.880
Mozilla is essentially shipping a WebKit browser on both mobile platforms now.

15:44.880 --> 15:51.680
Yeah, but to be fair, in this Firefox Focus, there is an option to open this page in Firefox.

15:51.680 --> 15:58.120
So if you've got the main big version of Firefox as well, then you can open it in Gecko.

15:58.120 --> 16:01.040
But that is interesting that they're shipping WebKit.

16:01.040 --> 16:04.740
The thing is that it's very limited.

16:04.740 --> 16:10.320
It's incredibly fast and it seemed to block pop ups and stuff really, really well.

16:10.320 --> 16:17.080
But I found that a fair bit of JavaScript didn't work in it, and also you've got a single

16:17.080 --> 16:18.080
tab.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.780
Well, so they have a note in here.

16:20.780 --> 16:25.740
They say, for Android users, we've also made Focus a great default browser experience since

16:25.740 --> 16:30.720
we support both custom tabs and the ability to disable ad blocking.

16:30.720 --> 16:31.720
Custom tabs, Joe.

16:31.720 --> 16:33.760
What the hell is custom tabs?

16:33.760 --> 16:36.920
It's not very clear because then they list one of the features is no tabs.

16:36.920 --> 16:37.920
I don't understand.

16:37.920 --> 16:38.920
Yeah.

16:38.920 --> 16:39.920
I didn't get that either.

16:39.920 --> 16:40.920
It's very strange.

16:40.920 --> 16:44.680
There's a couple other standout features for the Android version versus the iOS version,

16:44.680 --> 16:46.520
which I thought maybe be worth mentioning.

16:46.520 --> 16:47.740
I like this one.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.680
There's an ad tracker counter.

16:49.680 --> 16:53.480
So just for the curious, they're going to just count a little number of the amount of

16:53.480 --> 16:54.480
ads that they've blocked per site.

16:54.480 --> 16:55.480
That could be brutal.

16:55.480 --> 17:00.280
Yeah, I saw that, which, yeah, you can see some sites are just going way overboard.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.280
I mean, I have got a host file anyway.

17:03.280 --> 17:09.560
I use Addaway from F-Droid, and that updates your host file and just blocks most adverts.

17:09.560 --> 17:14.800
So, with that and Firefox Focus, you basically don't see any adverts.

17:14.800 --> 17:15.800
It's brilliant.

17:15.800 --> 17:21.040
If they just added tabs to it, I'd be using it all the time, I think, as my main browser.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.680
They say here at the end of the post that they're going to be adding new features that

17:24.680 --> 17:25.920
make it even better down the road.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.840
So maybe tabs is one of them.

17:27.840 --> 17:28.840
Yeah.

17:28.840 --> 17:32.600
Well, I installed this to check it out for the show, thinking that, well, after the show,

17:32.600 --> 17:33.600
I'll uninstall it.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.400
But this is staying on my phone, man.

17:35.400 --> 17:36.400
I completely agree.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.400
I keep it, too.

17:37.400 --> 17:41.240
It's really nice to just have something that's totally divorced from the vendor that has

17:41.240 --> 17:43.480
nothing to do with Google or Apple.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.640
And I trust Mozilla.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.640
And I think it's even more legitimate on Android.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.120
It's kind of funny that it came to iOS first.

17:49.120 --> 17:54.400
And they quoted some sort of statistic where it was very well reviewed on iOS.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.880
It's good to see it coming to Android, too.

17:55.880 --> 17:58.160
Yeah, I look forward to seeing the updates for it.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.600
So something else that Mozilla is working on that might immortalize your voice.

18:01.600 --> 18:06.760
Yeah, Project Common Voice, which they say is a project to help make voice recognition

18:06.760 --> 18:08.440
open to everyone.

18:08.440 --> 18:14.240
So we all know about the various big companies with their voice recognition in their digital

18:14.240 --> 18:15.240
assistants.

18:15.240 --> 18:20.520
Well, Mozilla is at least attempting here to make something that is open source that

18:20.520 --> 18:24.120
can be used by various projects, maybe even Mycroft.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.800
You never know.

18:25.800 --> 18:31.320
And they're basically crowdsourcing the voice input for that, because the thing that you

18:31.320 --> 18:36.400
need with any voice recognition system is a ton of data to work with.

18:36.400 --> 18:40.640
And they give you a really simple walkthrough sentence you can read and then upload to their

18:40.640 --> 18:41.640
servers.

18:41.640 --> 18:42.640
I'm probably using WebRTC.

18:42.640 --> 18:47.360
I didn't try it, but I did play some of their samples, and it's a neat idea.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.000
I'm sure Popey's over there submitting tons of different voices.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.000
Yeah.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.000
Well, I did.

18:52.000 --> 18:57.320
I read the three sentences that it wanted and also listened to five.

18:57.320 --> 18:58.320
And you can validate them.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.840
You can say yes or no.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.800
And a couple of them were wrong, so I ticked no.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.760
So hopefully that can make it learn a little bit more.

19:05.760 --> 19:12.440
So I would say that if you've got five minutes or even less than that, then go to voice.mozilla.org

19:12.440 --> 19:16.560
and help them out, because it's something that we can all potentially benefit from.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.380
I completely agree.

19:18.380 --> 19:23.640
So back to multimedia on Linux desktop, Opus 1.2 saw a major release this week, which has

19:23.640 --> 19:27.860
many quality improvements, new features, and bug fixes.

19:27.860 --> 19:34.680
So when I first heard about this, I was thinking, well, MP3 has just been freed from patents.

19:34.680 --> 19:38.120
And we've got Ogg Vorbis.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.160
So do we really need improvements to this?

19:40.160 --> 19:46.700
But then thinking about it, it's not really, I don't think, aimed at necessarily listening

19:46.700 --> 19:49.100
to podcasts or music directly.

19:49.100 --> 19:55.440
It's more that people can embed this codec in their applications.

19:55.440 --> 20:00.120
And so users will see a benefit without even knowing about it, probably.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.120
Yes, absolutely.

20:01.120 --> 20:06.200
And I think they have made improvements, ironically, that make it better for music.

20:06.200 --> 20:10.200
But I think one of the most notable improvements in this release are going to be some of the

20:10.200 --> 20:11.940
speech quality improvements.

20:11.940 --> 20:14.680
They come from something they call a hybrid mode.

20:14.680 --> 20:19.240
Hybrid mode is when the Cilk codec is used to encode speech frequencies up to 8 kilohertz.

20:19.240 --> 20:24.920
And then CELT, a different codec, kicks in, which is used on frequencies from 8 kilohertz

20:24.920 --> 20:26.640
all the way up to 20 kilohertz.

20:26.640 --> 20:30.520
So this hybrid mode allows Cilk and CELT to be used for their more appropriate frequency

20:30.520 --> 20:34.240
ranges and combine it into one stream, which is going to sound fantastic.

20:34.240 --> 20:38.760
So do you think there's any chance of music and podcasts moving over to using Opus instead

20:38.760 --> 20:41.060
of MP3 and AAC?

20:41.060 --> 20:44.520
If I was going to put on the idealist hat for a moment, I would say yes.

20:44.520 --> 20:50.720
But in reality, if you look at statistics, M4A, which is based on AAC, is a notable improvement

20:50.720 --> 20:58.240
over MP3 and has like a 0.9% MP3 market share, based on some stats I've heard from major

20:58.240 --> 20:59.240
podcast players.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.840
Yeah, MP3 is the name you know.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.980
It's the VHS, isn't it?

21:03.980 --> 21:06.800
It's not the best, but it's just what has won.

21:06.800 --> 21:13.600
Yeah, it's a universal format that plays on everything from televisions to workout wristbands.

21:13.600 --> 21:19.960
Yeah, you buy a cheap Chinese MP3 player for like, you can get them for $1 now, I think,

21:19.960 --> 21:22.880
for an MP3 player with like 8 gigs of storage or something.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.720
Absolutely unbelievable.

21:24.720 --> 21:29.080
That's going to play MP3s all the way up to the highest end smartphone.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.560
It's just everywhere.

21:30.560 --> 21:34.680
I think this is going back to your core point, why Opus is really great for telecommunications

21:34.680 --> 21:39.600
or things like Mumble or WebRTC communication, where it's an infrastructure-level codec

21:39.600 --> 21:43.760
that people are just going to notice things sound great, and maybe down-the-road podcasters

21:43.760 --> 21:47.600
won't do double-ended recordings because the internet codec will be just so incredible,

21:47.600 --> 21:48.600
thanks to Opus.

21:48.600 --> 21:55.080
But back at home, in the consumer world, things like MP3 and JPEGs stick because there's a

21:55.080 --> 21:56.680
larger problem here.

21:56.680 --> 22:01.880
Not only is it just consumer awareness, but there's also the thing we don't talk about.

22:01.880 --> 22:05.140
This digital stuff is ephemeral, and it can just go away.

22:05.140 --> 22:10.480
And backwards compatibility of something that lasts more than 10 years is extremely valuable

22:10.480 --> 22:11.480
in our lives.

22:11.480 --> 22:14.080
And as a parent, I have JPEGs from like 8 years ago, and I want to be able to open those

22:14.080 --> 22:16.180
JPEGs in 40 years from now.

22:16.180 --> 22:19.260
And I have audio recordings in MP3 that I want to play in 40 years.

22:19.260 --> 22:23.640
So there is some real value to some of these formats that stick, even if it's not their

22:23.640 --> 22:27.760
compression or their sound quality, but just having access to them matters.

22:27.760 --> 22:35.760
Yeah, for example, my dad did some writing about 20 years ago on an old Mac using Clarus

22:35.760 --> 22:38.200
Works, if you remember that.

22:38.200 --> 22:43.200
And I got the hard drive out, I had to get a SCSI adapter and stuff.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.400
And this was about five years ago, maybe.

22:45.400 --> 22:48.360
So it had only been 15 years since he'd written those.

22:48.360 --> 22:49.800
And I was really struggling.

22:49.800 --> 22:55.580
In the end, I found an online, I can't even remember what it was now, service that converted

22:55.580 --> 22:58.080
them to dot doc or something.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.400
Oh, very good.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.520
So I did manage to do it, but maybe I'd struggle now to do it.

23:02.520 --> 23:03.520
I don't know.

23:03.520 --> 23:08.800
But as you say, if that data is there in a format that is unreadable by modern machines.

23:08.800 --> 23:09.800
Yeah.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.980
And of course, eventually, you're going to want to move from dot doc to something like

23:11.980 --> 23:12.980
ODF.

23:12.980 --> 23:17.320
And going back to Opus for a moment, that's why these core open source formats really

23:17.320 --> 23:18.320
matter.

23:18.320 --> 23:22.280
You can see Opus, I believe, get implemented into more core technologies.

23:22.280 --> 23:25.000
And they have a really cool demo, which we'll have linked in the show notes if you scroll

23:25.000 --> 23:26.080
down the page a bit.

23:26.080 --> 23:33.480
They have an example of MP3 compared to Opus 1.0, and then 1.1, and now the new 1.2 release,

23:33.480 --> 23:35.060
and then versus uncompressed.

23:35.060 --> 23:38.560
The full range, you can really get a sense of how the project's matured, and how it really

23:38.560 --> 23:40.080
compares to MP3, and how great it is.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.880
It's a really clever idea.

23:41.880 --> 23:45.800
And it's a way to show off your work that only an audio codec could, and that's linked

23:45.800 --> 23:46.800
in the show notes.

23:46.800 --> 23:50.920
So does that mean we're going to hear, this is an example of Opus, a compression codec

23:50.920 --> 23:54.480
used specifically for speech?

23:54.480 --> 24:00.800
Joe, I certainly hope so, and I hope it sounds just like that.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.280
