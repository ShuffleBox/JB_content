00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,640
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 245, recorded on June 14th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,640
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,640
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,640
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,080
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,000
We start this week with two old favorites getting together.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,120
The Thunderbird project has announced that the K9 Mail app is not only joining the project,

8
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,120
but will ultimately transform into Thunderbird for Android.

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,560
Yeah, this has been in the works for some time, but it's only now becoming public as

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:40,360
Christian Ketter is joining MZLA Technologies, that's the home to Thunderbird, as a full-time

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,960
staffer as of June 1st.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,400
This acquihire really kind of underscores how much things have changed for Thunderbird.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,840
On the ropes, really just a few years ago, almost shut down by Mozilla, it's now no

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,920
longer part of the foundation, but not just standing on its own.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
It's thriving.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,320
We'll probably get some more details published publicly soon, but I had a chance to chat

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,340
with Ryan Sipes earlier today.

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,760
He's the product and business developer manager for Thunderbird, and he informs me that Thunderbird's

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,760
in a much better place these days, saying that nearly $3.5 million in revenue has been

20
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,200
achieved with 99.9% of that coming from donations by the users.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,280
And that's given them the ability to staff up to just over 20 people with the bandwidth

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,740
to execute on plans.

23
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,720
And using some of that prosperity to make an acquihire like Christian Ketter makes good

24
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
sense.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,820
I mean, was it ever going to be practical to port Thunderbird to Android at least any

26
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,820
time soon?

27
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,340
Plus, you're going to have to compete with K9 itself, which is doing a great job.

28
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,640
This way, they get to work together, plus, I mean, there's got to be some long-term benefits

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,600
from having Christian on staff as well.

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,480
Yeah, that all makes sense too, and I kind of get the sense that perhaps Christian was

31
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,960
reaching the end of his runway with K9.

32
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,040
It is a massive, massive project to take on for one developer.

33
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,900
When you consider you have to run a business, you have to provide support, you have to deal

34
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:09,080
with the Google Play Store and users, and then actually find time to develop.

35
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,560
So I think it makes sense.

36
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,080
So it seems like a nice straightforward fit for everyone.

37
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,680
But where I don't see things fitting so well is the different user bases of Thunderbird

38
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,680
and K9.

39
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,360
I mean, I think it's probably reasonable to assume that both user bases have probably

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,080
found their current mail app after trying either the default on their platform or another

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,600
email app that they just didn't like.

42
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,840
So maybe they're a little more particular about the way things work with their email

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,040
app than your average user.

44
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,460
And that seems like it's going to be a tricky thing for Thunderbird to balance and get just

45
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,920
right going forward.

46
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,600
So I asked Ryan just about that very thing.

47
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Sure.

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,120
It's not easy and it is, like you said, it is balancing.

49
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,920
It's a balancing act in that mobile and desktop are not the same devices.

50
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:57,980
They're not the same size, they don't work the same.

51
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,060
It's a very different experience and user expectations are different there.

52
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,880
But I feel like K9 was the best reflection of like what a Thunderbird experience on mobile

53
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,700
would look like.

54
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:17,720
And at our core, our values were exactly the same and that was the values of open standards

55
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:26,000
and open source, respecting the user and enabling power users with customization and the ability

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,080
to control their workflows.

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:36,100
And so I think that if we continue to carry those values into what we work on both sides,

58
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,840
I think that our users are enough alike in those respects that they'll be happy with

59
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
the outcome.

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,500
And then the practical side of that is since Kedi came on, we've been kind of doing a little

61
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,880
bit of a cultural exchange.

62
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,720
I've been talking a lot and various team members on our side have been talking a lot to K9

63
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,280
mail users to better understand their wants and needs and he's been talking to quite a

64
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,960
few of our users and so in that way, we're trying to see where the similarities are and

65
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,440
where the differences are and try to accommodate those.

66
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,480
I suppose time will tell, but I'd say that sounds like a pretty good mindset going into

67
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
things.

68
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,560
We also got the sense from Ryan that a couple of big desktop releases are in the works for

69
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,360
Thunderbird as well.

70
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:31,160
So we'll be keeping an eye out for that.

71
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,520
Now those of us still wanting to build a RISC-V desktop or server one day will be happy to

72
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,040
hear that Ubuntu is hard at work at bringing up and improving support for the Star 5 Vision

73
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,360
5 RISC-V board.

74
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,540
Michael Lonerbal over at Ferronix calls the $179 device quote, one of the most promising

75
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:57,720
low cost RISC-V single board computers to date intended to run full blown RISC-V Linux

76
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,920
distributions.

77
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,000
And you know what, we got to agree with him on that.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,740
The board comes in two varieties with four gigs or eight gigs of system memory powered

79
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,900
by a dual core PSI-5U74RV64SOC clocked at one gigahertz.

80
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:21,440
But it's also got an NV-DLA deep learning accelerator, a 10 silica VP6 vision DSP and

81
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
oh yeah, a neural network engine.

82
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
Woo.

83
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Yeah, okay.

84
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,400
I mean, I'm not blown away by the one gigahertz clock speed of the main CPU, but you do got

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,960
to start somewhere and they move more and more functionality off under these dedicated

86
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,560
co-processors, that performance story starts getting a little more complicated.

87
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,880
And keeping the price down means that these boards get in the hands of more developers.

88
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
So that seems like a good thing.

89
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,960
And of course, it means Ubuntu developers can work on enabling their Star 5 Vision boards

90
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,760
and getting their RISC-V kernel builds working on those boards.

91
00:05:53,760 --> 00:06:00,640
And that's going to mean more RISC hardware for everybody.

92
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,600
Because apparently there are always more clouds that need more operating systems.

93
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,920
This week, the Fedora Engineering and Steering Committee decided to relist their cloud spin

94
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,440
as an official Fedora edition.

95
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:21,280
Interestingly, this change was led by an Amazon AWS engineer who's also a Fedora contributor.

96
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,200
His name is David Duncan.

97
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:29,160
In his proposal, Duncan wrote, quote, cloud should be listed on getfedora.org along with

98
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,720
workstation, server, and IoT.

99
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,680
The petition to reinstate the cloud base as an official edition is based on the clear

100
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,240
identification of unique environmental support requirements for both private hyperscalers

101
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,600
as well as public cloud environments that are not specifically addressed by other editions.

102
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,080
Currently, Fedora Cloud is listed as an alternative download and not the same level as other editions

103
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,520
like workstation or server.

104
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,960
Fedora Cloud base images are produced in a raw image form.

105
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,200
So you've got builds for OpenStack, VirtualBox, and KVM images for Google Cloud Platform,

106
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,640
AWS, of course, and others.

107
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,200
So this proposal was looked at and received unanimous approval and will go into effect

108
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:22,480
for Fedora 37 this fall, assuming everything goes as planned.

109
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,280
Plasma 5.25 has just been released.

110
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,360
This latest version brings new features, of course, but also new workflow concepts to

111
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,600
the desktop environment.

112
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,800
This is a big one, guys.

113
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,480
There's been a lot of focus on gestures this release for the trackpads and for touchscreens,

114
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,440
which look particularly great.

115
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,840
And then visually, they've reworked the overview effect so it's much cleaner and modern looking.

116
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,520
And they've added this neat ability to sync your desktop accent colors with your wallpaper.

117
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,360
Yeah, that makes for definitely subtle but a nice effect that kind of ties your whole

118
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,760
desktop together.

119
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:05,440
And if you happen to use the slideshow as your wallpaper, the colors will update when

120
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,960
the wallpaper changes.

121
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
That's just a nice touch.

122
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,760
5.25 also makes some smart adjustments automatically when you invoke touch mode.

123
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,960
For example, the task manager and the system tray become just a little bit bigger, and

124
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,760
the title bars of KDE applications become taller.

125
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:27,560
And they have this new floating panel mode, which looks so cool.

126
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,040
And longtime plasma users, you're going to want to check out the new rewritten kwin script

127
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
settings page.

128
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,200
You're going to like it.

129
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,840
And you'll probably also enjoy the new keyboard navigation options for plasma panels.

130
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,120
Of course, I'm still trying it all out.

131
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:47,760
I've got it installed right now on my KDE neon box.

132
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,920
We wanted to take a moment to make sure you're aware that one of our favorite tools had an

133
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,680
update this week.

134
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,040
That tool, well, it's ventoy.

135
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,140
If you're not familiar, then you must not be listening to Linux unplugged.

136
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,840
But ventoy is a popular bootable USB utility that makes it easy to store multiple different

137
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,760
ISOs and then choose which one to boot right on the fly.

138
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,600
Version 1.0.76 now supports secure boot by default, including a much improved ability

139
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,720
to enroll secure boot keys.

140
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,400
Along with that important update, though, they've also added additional ISO support,

141
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,680
which brings the total supported number over 900.

142
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,400
Plus, there's bug fixes, small improvements, the usual.

143
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:39,040
We'll have a link in the show notes if you're still not using ventoy.

144
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,820
Linode dot com slash LAN.

145
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,320
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support this

146
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,440
here show.

147
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,520
Linode is really how we make all of the things that we pull off online possible and you should

148
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,520
too.

149
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
It's fast.

150
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
It's reliable.

151
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,080
They've been doing this for nearly 19 years.

152
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
Go try them out.

153
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,200
Go see what I've been talking about.

154
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,760
Go put that $100 to use.

155
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,200
They've really been focused at making the best platform to run applications on Linux

156
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,280
for almost 20 years.

157
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,880
That's led to the best in class experience and why we host everything on Linode.

158
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,160
You combine the stability, the performance, the support, the selections.

159
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,560
They're always deploying the latest Linux distributions if that's what you like to do.

160
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,600
Of course, they have the classics like you might expect, like your Alma's and your Rockies.

161
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,400
One thing that I like to try is just go to their marketplace from time to time and see

162
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,440
what their apps are for the one click deployment because they're often adding new stuff.

163
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,800
There's always things on the backend you could take advantage of or not depending on how

164
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,080
complicated you want things like VLAN support, DDoS protection, a powerful DNS manager, and

165
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,220
they have super fast networking.

166
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,260
They are their own ISP.

167
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,880
With prices 30% to 50% cheaper than the major cloud providers out there, you get a great

168
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,440
deal too with great service.

169
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,580
As I record, there's still about 17 days to create an open source project and win some

170
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,320
serious prizes from Linode.

171
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,400
They're partnering with Hashnode.

172
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,080
They have a hackathon running from June 1st to June 30th.

173
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,160
Grand prizes, there'll be runner-up prizes, swag, and you'll even just get something for

174
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,160
participating.

175
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,840
And I'm talking cash prizes.

176
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,600
So go check out Linode's Twitter account for details on that.

177
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,720
But first, go to linode.com slash LAN.

178
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,240
Support the show and get that $100 on a new account and really kick the tires.

179
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,600
It's linode.com slash LAN.

180
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,960
We end this week with Adobe, which has recently announced its plans to make Photoshop on the

181
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,800
web free for everyone.

182
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,440
Now, right now, the company's testing this free version in Canada, where users can access

183
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,080
Photoshop on the web with a free account.

184
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:52,040
Adobe describes the service as, quote, freemium, and eventually plans to gate off some features

185
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,520
that will be exclusive to paying subscribers, because of course they will.

186
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:00,880
But they do say that enough tools will be freely available to perform what they consider

187
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,820
Photoshop's, quote, core functions.

188
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:10,840
So I guess this is technically Photoshop coming to Linux eventually.

189
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,000
And then maybe we always kind of figured it would go this way.

190
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But you know, it still struck me as funny, Wes.

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,880
This just feels like yet another example where for decades we pined as a Linux community

192
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,700
to have somebody bring their application to Linux.

193
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,400
And then when that finally arrives, it's never quite how we pictured it was going to be.

194
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,480
You know, it's always kind of a little bit different.

195
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,720
Like if I wanted to Photoshop on the web, I'd just use Photopea at Photopea.com like

196
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,960
right now.

197
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,200
We've arrived in the future where I thought we'd have all these native apps.

198
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,480
And what we have is a bunch of web apps.

199
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,600
Yeah, I mean, what, 10, 15 years ago, Chris, you know, Linux desktop hopefuls, probably

200
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,840
hoping for some sort of like, native, cute thing, you know, it felt like it was home

201
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
on the Linux desktop.

202
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:02,640
It was all the same logic, full functionality, just like a native first class Linux version.

203
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,080
And instead, I mean, yes, we've watched the rise of web apps more generally, but we've

204
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,000
also seen the rise of Electron and companies deciding that that's the target they're going

205
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,680
to adopt to go multi platform.

206
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,600
But at the same time, we've sort of seen the success of Wine, which has kind of hedged

207
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,000
off in the same direction, right?

208
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,320
Now we're clamoring less for some of these applications, because whether it's Wine directly,

209
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:33,160
or now that we've got Proton, there's a compatibility shim we can apply and it's kind of just good

210
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
enough.

211
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,020
So I don't know if I'm disappointed or just realistic, but it's kind of wild in how many

212
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,000
different domains this has happened from, you know, from the modern version of Outlook

213
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,800
for Office 365, almost everything's on the web these days.

214
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,000
And I guess that means the operating system is just a lot less important, at least as

215
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,480
long as it runs Chrome.

216
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,400
Yeah, maybe that's part of what I'm feeling here a little bit of that.

217
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,720
But then there's the like the practical side, like you say, people who need Photoshop on

218
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,240
Linux that would like to use Linux, they had now will, I mean, they're gonna have an option

219
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
for the first time.

220
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,420
It's actual real Photoshop.

221
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:14,480
That's kind of incredible, because I know I have been multiple times in the position

222
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,720
of needing to get Photoshop going under Wine, just because somebody sent me a Photoshop

223
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,520
file that maybe we contracted with, or, you know, I'm going to open up some legacy show

224
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,720
art and that's in a Photoshop file format.

225
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,320
And you know, the whole rigmarole of trying to get that working under Wine, trying to

226
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,240
get the right version, do I have the ability to license it, that kind of stuff, it'd be

227
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,800
nice just to see all that go away.

228
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,600
So a free version is a good thing.

229
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,440
It means more people have access to this.

230
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,400
And it also it's worth mentioning that this historically been like a very expensive application.

231
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,300
Photoshop alone used to be over a grand, then they locked it behind the Creative Cloud membership.

232
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,640
And the other factor is the other real practical thing that you kind of made me think about

233
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,160
here is for most people, the core functionality is probably enough.

234
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,200
The free functionality is probably going to be enough.

235
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,440
Ah, you're right.

236
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,120
I mean, does that does that hurt the use case for some of our our favorite tools like GIMP?

237
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,840
You know, the things that we're kind of meeting that low common denominator baseline, but now

238
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,760
it's now it's just another web sass that you're going to use instead.

239
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,280
Maybe I don't know.

240
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,260
Or do people really prefer native apps?

241
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,520
Or perhaps because it took Adobe so long to bring Photoshop to Linux?

242
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,280
Maybe things like GIMP have enough of an established user base that they don't have to worry now?

243
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
It's possible.

244
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,880
I do also wonder if we're going to see this continue with the rest of the suite, you know,

245
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,360
kind of kind of as you mentioned, because it's been so long, we just still haven't gotten

246
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:43,960
Photoshop, whether it's photopea, or GIMP, or other other tools or whole virtual machines,

247
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,360
folks have come up with workarounds.

248
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,560
But if this ends up being the whole creative suite that's easy to access online, that might

249
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
be hard to resist.

250
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,400
True, wouldn't that be something after effects in a web browser?

251
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,640
And you could see it going that way.

252
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:03,000
Companies have limited resources, limited time, even rich companies.

253
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,400
And this is just clearly a easy, honestly, very available, like both in skill set.

254
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,720
And in technology, it's very easy and available to do this kind of web app development now.

255
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,720
And it just gives you cross app, cross device, cross platform compatibility just out of the

256
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,160
box.

257
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,840
So yeah, I think you're right, Wes, I think we're gonna see a lot more things go this

258
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
way.

259
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,520
In the entire creative suite.

260
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,400
Let us know what you think out there.

261
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:36,240
And whichever way it goes, native applications, web applications, or no applications at all,

262
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
we'll let you know.

263
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,680
Just go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

264
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,160
And linuxactionnews.com slash contact to let us know why Adobe should probably be using

265
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Flutter.

266
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
That's right.

267
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,880
And of course, you can support this show and all the network shows and get them ad free

268

As for this show, well, don't worry, we'll be back next week with our take on the latest

270
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,840
Linux and open source news.

271
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,840
Thanks for joining us.

272
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:24,200
And that's all the news for this week.
