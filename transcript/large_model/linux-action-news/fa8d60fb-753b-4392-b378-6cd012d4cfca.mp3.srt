00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 134, recorded on December 1st, 2019.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,200
And we start this week with the contract for the web officially launching.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,860
Yeah, this was on the mainstream news here in the UK.

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,680
And Tim Berners-Lee has been working on this since at least the summer.

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,080
We talked about it on Linux Action News 117 back in August.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,120
But now it's officially launched.

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,920
And it's got the website, and it's got various companies and governments signed up to it.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,040
And it's going to save the web.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,080
We're going to not have a digital dystopia.

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,760
Yeah, this contract, which has been worked on by over 80 organizations for, really, I

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,640
think more than a year total, outlines nine central principles to safeguard the web.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,580
Three each for governments, companies, and individuals.

17
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:55,760
This document was published by Berners-Lee's Web Foundation, has the backing of more than

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,960
150 organizations, Microsoft, Twitter, and Google, and Facebook are on that list, as

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,720
well as the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,040
At the time of this episode, notably, Amazon's not on that list.

21
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,120
Yeah, and also Mozilla is not on the list.

22
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,840
And they put up a brief blog post about why.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,000
And they pretty much say it's because there's no accountability.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,200
And this thing's pretty much toothless.

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,440
They are broadly positive about it and say they support it.

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,080
But they say there's no point signing it until there's some accountability there.

27
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,920
I think they have very tactfully put what is a major concern.

28
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,680
They write, we've decided not to sign the contract, but would consider doing so if stronger

29
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,560
accountability measures are added.

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,440
That's my problem with it, is the W3C, which Tim Berners-Lee is the director of, has really

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,640
kind of shown us how the exact corporations that are signed on to this document have co-opted

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,680
it to implement things like DRM in the browser.

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,480
Tim Berners-Lee really hasn't, unfortunately, been a very good steward of that.

34
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,760
And so now I have very little confidence in this contract that's being signed by the very

35
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,480
same influencers.

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,040
And when there's no particular accountability clauses in here, other than you just lose

37
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,020
membership, so you can't put a badge on your website, I don't really understand what the

38
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:19,940
mechanism is to keep things in check, to actually go for all of these privacy goals and other

39
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,080
such things.

40
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,680
And I hate to say something like that about him, because I know he's made a very significant

41
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,280
contribution to the World Wide Web.

42
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,120
But it seems like the wolves are in the henhouse on this one.

43
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,720
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,800
What triggered me as a pedant is the fact that they kind of interchange web and internet

45
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,100
as if they're synonymous, which to a lot of people they are, but it just always annoys

46
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,400
me when people get those two confused.

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,040
And the only real assurance we have here that the tech giants, as he puts them, he calls

48
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,360
them tech giants, is that they are committed to action.

49
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,160
That's our reassurance that they won't influence this thing, such as they have with the W3C.

50
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,800
I just find this whole thing kind of flabbergasting.

51
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,880
It seems like legacy making, and at least an attempt at it.

52
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,720
I don't see what action is going to result of this that's actually going to improve the

53
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
situation on the web.

54
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,760
I completely agree with Mozilla on this one.

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,520
Well, it might be a good basis from which they can add accountability.

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
I don't know.

57
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,400
Maybe that's clutching at straws for this.

58
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,040
But the principle, too, for the governments, keep all of the internet available all of

59
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,200
the time.

60
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,900
If that actually happened, that would be good, because right now, if I go to certain sites

61
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,480
like the Pirate Bay or whatever, it's blocked by my ISP, by order of my government.

62
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,400
So the UK government literally could not sign up to this, I don't think.

63
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,780
And I think you might recall the EFF left the W3C after they advocated for the inclusion

64
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:53,520
of DRM in web standards, because in the EFF's view, that made the web less accessible.

65
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,760
So you could argue his existing organization has already been directly involved in making

66
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,000
the web less accessible and making information available to fewer people.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Well, you could argue that.

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,800
But at the time, I was broadly in favor of adding it as a standard, rather than just

69
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,080
having every company just create their own standard.

70
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,060
Yeah, I don't necessarily mean to reopen the debate, because there are advantages.

71
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,000
But I do see where the EFF was coming from.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,600
They're the ones that left the W3C.

73
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,880
And so I can completely understand their point.

74
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
You're right, though.

75
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,660
I do think what you were saying earlier is that there is some positive side effects to

76
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,180
having an aspirational framework in which we should work towards.

77
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,180
But it also could just be used as a marketing badge to say, you know, you support user rights

78
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,060
and user privacy, and you can tell because I'm a part of this club, with no actual changes

79
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,060
happening.

80
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,060
I don't know.

81
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,200
I guess I'm being a little pessimistic on this one.

82
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,500
But it just seems like the ship has sailed.

83
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,820
When I mentioned Mozilla, they've published their annual State of Mozilla report for 2018.

84
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,000
And they are really emphasizing the privacy stuff that they've been doing.

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,520
Yeah, you might wonder why they report for 2018 at the end of 2019.

86
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,480
Well, of course, that's how these things work.

87
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:06,560
Really, this report release is timed to coincide with when they submit their Mozilla nonprofit

88
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,960
tax filing for the previous calendar year.

89
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,040
So they time these things to come together.

90
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,720
They really do, Joe.

91
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,180
They really do focus on their efforts in privacy, and I'd say also in social change.

92
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,880
And they highlight as well, like their efforts to try to speak and advocate to legislation,

93
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,960
which surprised me that they kind of hit on that so hard.

94
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,920
Very little in there about the browser.

95
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,960
Yeah.

96
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,960
As it is often, they really like to highlight what makes them different.

97
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,280
And I think this line in here is a key thing to understand and fully appreciate about Mozilla.

98
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,800
And we'll have a link to this annual report, by the way, in the notes.

99
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,160
They say, we measure our success not only by the adoption of our products, but also

100
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:55,600
by our ability to increase the control people have in their online lives, our impact on

101
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,040
the internet, our contribution to standards, and how we work to protect the overall health

102
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
of the web.

103
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,280
Now, I don't know how they measure and get data metrics on any of those particulars,

104
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,380
but I think that really speaks volumes about them as an organization.

105
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,840
It's much more than a browser now.

106
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,600
Yeah, it does sound a bit ethereal, but they have launched some other products and services

107
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,160
over the last year or so.

108
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
Indeed.

109
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,960
And would you really, really want to see the Mozilla folks all focused on profit and nothing

110
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
else?

111
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,120
I think that'd make us all just a bit uncomfortable.

112
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,040
And it is a really wide umbrella when you define it like that.

113
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:39,240
It's from everything from VPN services to helping people shop for products that don't

114
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,600
spy on you as much.

115
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:47,480
It's a weird wide spectrum, but I guess it kind of makes sense if you want some authority

116
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,000
you can trust and Mozilla says, hey, that's us.

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah.

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,440
They've ramped up their privacy not included, be smart, shop safe, gift giving guide for

119
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,440
this year.

120
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Yeah.

121
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,020
Over on the foundation.mozilla.org site, they've set up a shopping browser that lets you filter

122
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:10,280
a bunch of products with large pictures on their creepiness factor so you can have something

123
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,280
that's fairly creepy or not creepy at all and the likelihood you would buy it and if

124
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,320
it meets their minimum security standards.

125
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
More on that in a moment.

126
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,920
And what you get is a product listing from various vendors and they have everything on

127
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,760
here from Sonos products.

128
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Like they have one here, the, the Ikea Sonos speaker and they have like witty little summaries.

129
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,240
They've rewritten the product summaries, which is kind of odd, but also fun.

130
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,520
Like they're one here, a Sonos speaker with Ikea design.

131
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,520
That's all.

132
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,380
That's the blurb or, or like they have one for the Apple TV.

133
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,140
They recommend that as a less creepy set top box.

134
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,960
If money's no object, the Apple TV and like, well actually Apple TV is not much more expensive

135
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,960
than Nvidia shield.

136
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,960
Like it's, I don't know.

137
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,800
It's kind of funny like their takes on it and they have the Apple watch on here.

138
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,160
You ever notice the Apple watch only becomes a watch if you jiggle your wrist or tap its

139
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
face.

140
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Some watch, huh?

141
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,800
Well, the 2019 upgrade to the new Apple watch five fixes all of that.

142
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,180
Like they're, they're like, they're copy editors over here and there's products on here I wouldn't

143
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:21,000
expect like the nest outdoor security camera, a Google nest security camera that is literally

144
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,080
streaming video 24 seven to Google's data centers.

145
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
They don't mind it.

146
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,780
It meets their minimum security standards.

147
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,620
Of course it's had a lot of votes and 58% of the people said they would not buy it,

148
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:39,280
but it's on here and it has all the stars.

149
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,920
I guess if it depends on what your standards are, if the security standard is, it uses

150
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:50,000
encryption between your home and their data center and it does updates and it supports

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,560
passwords and it self updates if there's a vulnerability, then yes, I suppose that is

152
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,200
a good metric to judge by, but I would like to know what are they doing with this video?

153
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,880
Like when you, when it comes to smart devices, they need to go a layer deeper.

154
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,200
Like they recommend the switch, but they don't tell you how Nintendo online is tracking you.

155
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,000
They're not telling you what metrics Nintendo's collecting and I'm not saying they have to

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,880
know these things, but that would be real value.

157
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,120
Instead of witty rewrites of product descriptions that these companies have probably worked

158
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,080
very hard on, I would way rather they spend some money getting statements and quotes from

159
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
these companies.

160
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,160
That would be a tremendous value.

161
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,840
Yeah, it would be, but I think what they've done does have value showing you that there

162
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,440
are certain products out there that are just never going to get updates and not using proper

163
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,680
encrypted connections back to the data center because most people don't care about their

164
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,480
data or don't necessarily think about it.

165
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,640
So I suppose, yeah, it would be good if they flagged up the fact that these things were

166
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:55,600
hoovering up data, but at least they're kind of excluding really, really dodgy IoT devices.

167
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,880
Yeah, I can't disagree with that and I think the one that really stood out to me as really

168
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,160
adding some value is you can go look up the ring video doorbell products from their different

169
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,320
types of cameras they have and they're pretty straightforward.

170
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,000
There's both positive things to these and there's negatives and one of the negatives

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,280
they point out is just beware, these doorbells do have some potential privacy vulnerabilities.

172
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,400
That's how they're referring to them as vulnerabilities that could let someone go big brother on you

173
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,680
in your home.

174
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,580
They also mentioned that they had a hard time figuring out the exact information around

175
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,160
what kind of encryption it uses and they note that in September 2019, security reachers

176
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,120
discovered a vulnerability.

177
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,080
So there does seem to be real value added to some of these, especially for people who

178
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,640
don't follow the tech news very close, but they've heard of some of these product names

179
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,900
and they decided they want to pick a few of these up.

180
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,120
This could help eliminate a couple off that list.

181
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,480
Yeah, and it might only have two stars, but now I've learned about this, I'm definitely

182
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
going to get it.

183
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,000
It's a $500 Wi-Fi enabled automatic self-cleaning litter box.

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,760
I'm getting it for my foster cats.

185
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,080
Right the Litter Robot 3, is that the one you're looking at?

186
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
Yeah.

187
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,080
I saw that.

188
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,880
I thought of you when I saw that one.

189
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
Now what's the problem?

190
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,000
What don't they like about it?

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,480
Looks like it doesn't support strong passwords and then it's not clear if they have a formal

192
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
bug bounty program.

193
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
Yeah.

194
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,240
No privacy policy as well, although it does get security updates and it does use encryption.

195
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,880
So that's why it gets two stars.

196
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
I like this.

197
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,120
They say occasionally it has third party professionals perform security audits.

198
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,200
So there's clearly been some real work done to look into these things.

199
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,560
Wouldn't it be incredible if they had comments from the companies on here?

200
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,960
I think that would be next level, not necessarily allow them to respond to everything, but

201
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,240
maybe for some things, like what's the Nest video storage policy after a year?

202
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,840
Just get some information from Google's Nest division.

203
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,000
Those kinds of things would, I feel like empower somebody like myself who I already know these

204
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
things.

205
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I already know it's using SSL.

206
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,320
I already know that Ring can share footage with the police, that they can request that.

207
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,060
I already know these things, but the things I can't as a regular consumer get access to,

208
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,120
they might be able to get comment on.

209
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
Bad news though, I'm afraid.

210
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,600
When I told my wife that we should get it, she replied with two words that I can't say

211
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
on air.

212
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,560
Anything that makes the flat smell better seems like a net positive increase in quality

213
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
of life.

214
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,560
Yeah, exactly.

215
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,560
I'll sell it to her that way.

216
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,360
You know what you should have done, Joe?

217
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,640
Christmas gift for the cat.

218
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
Never even brought it up.

219
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,640
It's the holidays.

220
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Good thinking.

221
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,920
Now you know to look for the next Black Friday sale though.

222
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,600
Well, by this time next year, most IoT devices will probably be using Alexa voice service

223
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,840
integration for AWS IoT Core.

224
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,220
You said the trigger word.

225
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,920
We apologize.

226
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,480
This might happen over the next couple of minutes for this story.

227
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,200
You might be wondering why we're covering this because on the surface here, it may seem

228
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,920
like not a Linux story, but that's actually what's so neat about this.

229
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:58,700
This is not only going to run on Linux, but this is going to mean a whole new level of

230
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:05,360
Echo devices built into things from washing machines to light switches to microwaves because

231
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:14,280
they're putting out a nearly DIY complete kit that you can use for development purposes.

232
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:21,640
And then they've created a secure way to tunnel MQTT messages back up to the AWS servers.

233
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,880
Now self-hosted listeners will recognize that's a big deal.

234
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,520
They're going all in on MQTT with this, and they write on their website, devices will

235
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:35,480
communicate with AVS, that's the, we won't say her name, voice service, over a single

236
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:42,800
secure MQTT connection to AWS IoT Core, and it connects with your account, it uses a key

237
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,000
exchange system, and it allows their cloud service that you deploy to subscribe to certain

238
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,120
topics on each one of these IoT devices, like take a smart plug.

239
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,960
Is it on?

240
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,320
What's the current draw?

241
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,080
How long has it been running?

242
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,960
These are topics that the service can subscribe to and get updates on when the device provides

243
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:08,440
them, and then it stores them at the AWS cloud infrastructure instead of those things having

244
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,440
to remain on device.

245
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,960
So they can be pretty low-end devices.

246
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,200
You pair that up with what are like these little platforms, everything with boxes with

247
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,400
screens to crazy microphone array hardware boxes that are just really bare bones dev

248
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:29,720
kits, and it's going to mean systems that need less than a megabyte of RAM and have

249
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:36,200
a really low-end ARM Cortex M class CPU can now do echo services.

250
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Yeah, it used to be that devices needed 50 megabytes or more of memory and run a proper

251
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,440
full-blown operating system like Linux or Android, whereas now it's going to be just

252
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:54,640
real bare bones, very cheap devices, and all of that processing is going to happen on AWS,

253
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,880
and that's the genius of this because Amazon wants to win the voice assistant war, and

254
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,340
they also want to drive companies and people to AWS.

255
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:07,760
It's kind of a double win for them, and if these companies making light switches or dishwashers

256
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,640
or whatever use this tech, which seems very likely to me because they're lowering that

257
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:19,800
barrier of entry now, it's going to mean that the echo devices and the word that you don't

258
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,880
want me to say becomes ubiquitous, and it's all going through AWS, and if you look at

259
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,720
the pricing for it, it's the typical cloud pricing.

260
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,040
It's just a little bit for this, a little bit for that, but it soon adds up, and if

261
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,260
you're shipping hundreds of thousands of dishwashers or washing machines or whatever, you're going

262
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,320
to end up spending a lot of money on AWS, and Amazon gets to cash in.

263
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,920
Yeah.

264
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,920
You joke about the washing machine situation, but I actually think it's going to happen.

265
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,440
Imagine a scenario where the latest Whirlpool or Samsung, maybe this is already a thing,

266
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,060
I haven't shopped for a washing machine in a while, they want to have integration with

267
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,040
cloud services, so that way you could just check in on if your load is done washing yet.

268
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,440
Commercial washer and dryer outfits have this all over the states now.

269
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,160
You start a load, you can check the status on your phone, and you get a notification

270
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,160
when it's done.

271
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,400
Consumers are going to want that, and even the most basic washer and dryers in a few

272
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
years.

273
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,840
It sounds crazy, but you know it will happen, and so Amazon creating these kits that when

274
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,040
you buy one of these kits, you go through them, it comes with out-of-box connectivity

275
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
to AWS IoT Core.

276
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,320
It's already qualified and ready to go for their audio algorithms for far field voice

277
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
pickup.

278
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:35,320
It supports their algorithms for echo cancellation and the A-word, wake word system, all already

279
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,420
set up and ready to connect back to their IoT Core, and you can get it for super cheap,

280
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,680
and you can scale that way, way up.

281
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,720
You touched on it, Joe, but having had some real hands-on experience with the Echo products

282
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,920
and watched how they've developed over the last few years, nobody is playing the game

283
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,160
as seriously as Amazon is.

284
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,940
The Nest line of products and the HomePod are both perfectly great for their own reasons,

285
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:06,900
if you're into those kinds of things, but nobody is bringing the fight like the Echoes.

286
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,220
There's way more variations of products.

287
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,240
They update them on a routine basis.

288
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,340
They have really kind of moonshot products like the ring coming soon that is an actual

289
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:21,840
ring on your finger, and on top of that, it's constantly asking me for information as like

290
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,900
a, I don't know how to put it, like a self-learning mechanism.

291
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,640
One of the things that the Google products have historically been good at is random knowledge.

292
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,060
You can ask it something and it'll pull up a knowledge card.

293
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:37,680
They're solving that now on the Echo platform by sourcing things from different places like

294
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,520
Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia, and there's a system in there where it judges if it's the

295
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,040
right time to ask me, and it says, by the way, was that the information you were looking

296
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,040
for?

297
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,560
And I can give it self-correcting information every now and then, and it gets better and

298
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,560
better.

299
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:58,960
Plus, they roll out new features and celebrity integrations and different size screens and

300
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,500
all of these fancy products that show they are so much more serious about this.

301
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:09,520
But when I saw that they were embracing MQTT and they were doing it this way over the internet,

302
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,160
my mind really started racing where this could go in the future.

303
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,180
On the Self-Hosted podcast, we talk about the Tasmota firmware, which you can re-flash

304
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:23,440
smart devices with this open source firmware, and it's all about using MQTT to communicate

305
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,580
back to your home system.

306
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,600
It's something that the open source community has embraced because back in 2010, it went

307
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
royalty-free.

308
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,440
It's been around since the late 90s, and in 2010, the floodgates opened, and we've seen

309
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,160
some really cool implementations of different uses of MQTT.

310
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:47,160
So there's a lot of products out there that you can re-flash and use MQTT, or cool projects

311
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,320
that use it already, and I could see how they could expand this to include and support all

312
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
of those, too.

313
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,760
Well, so you think that's a possibility then, you don't think they're going to be locked

314
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:55,760
down?

315
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,760
It's hard to say.

316
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
I mean, they could.

317
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,760
That's the thing.

318
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
That's the beauty of it.

319
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,680
If they really wanted to take over and let you really integrate all kinds of devices

320
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,120
into their AWS IoT platform with some tech switches they flip, they could enable that.

321
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,520
And they may never, but they're positioned to if they feel like it's necessary, it seems.

322
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,800
Well, I mentioned the word dystopia earlier.

323
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,720
This is what it feels like to me, not being someone who uses any of these devices.

324
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,800
I would never have an Echo in my house.

325
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Thank you very much.

326
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,480
Yeah, I think it's going to be like, I suspect, I think it's going to be like how you just

327
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,680
really can't buy non-smart TVs anymore, they're all smart TVs now.

328
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,360
I suspect it's sort of like smartifying everything, it's the smartification of everything.

329
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,880
And it's really obnoxious, because you're right, there's clear privacy implications.

330
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,960
We do have a podcast that covers these types of things, including how you can block these

331
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,840
types of things at the DNS level, which is what I do at my house.

332
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,740
I experiment with these things on and off, and when I'm done, I actually just leave the

333
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,600
devices in, but I just block the functionality at the DNS level.

334
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,600
And it works really well.

335
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,840
Well, like I always say, I'll get into this when I can run it completely on my LAN and

336
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,880
not have to connect to any sort of cloud services, which seems like it's getting closer, but

337
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,000
we're not quite there yet.

338
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yeah, not yet.

339
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,520
But I think it will be sooner than later.

340
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,680
I think there'll be a couple of, oh, maybe I should save this for a prediction.

341
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
Hmm.

342
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
I think I will, Joe.

343
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,740
I think I'm going to save it for a predictions episode.

344
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,600
Maybe you should predict that someone will crack these devices using Kali Linux.

345
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,280
Hey, yeah, especially the new release, which looks great.

346
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:30,160
Kali 2019.4 is out with lots of new fancy features, but I think there's one main feature

347
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,200
that has nothing to do with vulnerability assessments or exploitation that you care

348
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
about.

349
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,640
Yeah, they've switched to XFCE by default.

350
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,520
Very sensible idea.

351
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,920
And it's a pretty slick looking XFCE too.

352
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,200
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

353
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,960
It's a little bit too dark for my taste.

354
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,720
I know you're all in on dark mode, but for me, it's a little bit hard to read sometimes.

355
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,720
I knew you were going to say that.

356
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,240
But one cool feature of it is Kali undercover.

357
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,840
And so you just type Kali-undercover in the terminal and it just instantly switches to

358
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,460
look like Windows 10.

359
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,960
So if you're out in public somewhere and you don't want people to know that you are up

360
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,760
to whatever it is you're up to with Kali Linux, it looks like Windows 10 and no one will bat

361
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
an eyelid.

362
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,760
Okay.

363
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,760
All right.

364
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,560
But be honest, did you really think it looked like Windows 10?

365
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:22,120
I think it looked enough like it to not attract attention.

366
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
From like across the room.

367
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
Oh, yeah.

368
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
And that's all it needs to do, right?

369
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Yeah.

370
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Okay.

371
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
All right.

372
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,120
Yeah, I'll give it that.

373
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,080
That'd be my level of passes the sniff test there.

374
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
I wouldn't use it though.

375
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,840
I liked that GTK theme.

376
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,400
I thought it was great and they did have a light version of it too if you wanted to go

377
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
back.

378
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,040
There's a couple of things about this release that really impressed me.

379
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:47,520
I think it's been maybe a couple of years since I've given Kali a go.

380
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,180
Man they've done a lot with this thing.

381
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:54,000
So we've talked about the way it looks, but what's really remarkable in my opinion is

382
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,040
their commitment to documentation everywhere throughout the menu.

383
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:03,520
It's very easy to get information about things you could try doing, ways to learn, even ways

384
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,360
to get professional training.

385
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,120
And when you launch a command line tool, it opens up in the shell with the TAC TAC help

386
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
already set.

387
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,700
You get all the information that that command can do.

388
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,920
You get what I mean by that.

389
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,000
It's really helpful because you get all of the flags, all the information right there

390
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,100
and it makes it approachable.

391
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,680
But on top of that, they've made it super simple to set persistent USB mode because

392
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,560
it's right in the grub menu.

393
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,120
So people that aren't necessarily Linux pros but are trying to learn a Linux tool so that

394
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,360
way they can improve their network security have really easy, obvious options.

395
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,600
And then last but not least, they've made a commitment to moving their documentation

396
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,120
to Markdown and putting it up on GitHub so people can make pull requests and merge requests.

397
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,040
And it's approachable being in Markdown that just about anybody except for Joe could write

398
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
it.

399
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,480
That's kind of say, yeah, I was like Markdown.

400
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,000
It's interesting that they've added PowerShell to it, which is not something I'm going to

401
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,280
use, but I think potentially a lot of Windows users coming over may be used to using.

402
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,960
Yeah, I think that's pretty neat.

403
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:11,340
PowerShell because honestly, it's a multi-operating system world right now and to be able to go

404
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,080
after Windows boxes and Linux boxes from one OS is, well, it's a feature.

405
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,840
So there's one other really kind of large headlining feature here that we haven't touched

406
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
on.

407
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,680
Again, I think it's important to mention that Kali offers so much more than these headline

408
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,760
features, but this is pretty neat.

409
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,680
It's called NetHunter Kex and it's a full Kali desktop on your Android phone.

410
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:35,000
So in a nutshell, it allows you to attach your Android device to an HDMI output along

411
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,480
with a Bluetooth keyboard and a mouse and you get full, as they put it, no compromise

412
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,800
Kali desktop on an Android phone.

413
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,760
Of course, it's up on an HDMI screen, but the idea could be maybe you've got a Raspberry

414
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:52,000
Pi device or a laptop or a VM that's headless and then you can just sit down, plug an Android

415
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,960
device in and get full access to it using this NetHunter.

416
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,560
Yeah, that is pretty slick and GNOME users, don't worry.

417
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,160
There is still a GNOME version of it.

418
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,160
It's just XFC by default.

419
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,880
There's also a Marte and Plasma versions.

420
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Oh, really?

421
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,880
Yeah.

422
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,880
Pretty much all the bases are covered.

423
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
Yeah.

424
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
I didn't even bother checking for those.

425
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,000
That's normally would be part of my overall review, but I would really recommend giving

426
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,680
the XFC version a go because they really strike a balance between decent performance, look

427
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,400
and resources.

428
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,320
This is such a powerful distribution.

429
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,120
This is a real gift and I don't say that lightly.

430
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,160
Having done this professionally back in the day and before Kali existed, but other tools

431
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,680
before it did and it made all the difference because I had one spot to sit down and learn

432
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,680
these things because they also link you to vulnerability databases and scenarios that

433
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,160
you can use to learn that are publicly available that the community posts.

434
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,160
And I've got to dig more into this because they've done so much good work with this distro.

435
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,440
There's other things they've included by default that we can't even touch on because it would

436
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,920
just take the whole episode.

437
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:56,600
So I think Wes and I will talk about it more in Linux Unplugged this week.

438
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,560
Well, as I always say, I look forward to listening to it three times.

439
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
Yes.

440
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,800
Yes, as the editor, I'd say at least three times, probably not to mention if you tune

441
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,800
in live.

442
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Yeah.

443
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,000
Make it an even four.

444
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,800
Well, check out linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes of this
