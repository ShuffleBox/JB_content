00:00.000 --> 00:09.380
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 156, recorded on September 27th, 2020.

00:09.380 --> 00:10.380
I'm Chris.

00:10.380 --> 00:11.380
And I'm Joe.

00:11.380 --> 00:12.380
Hello, Joe.

00:12.380 --> 00:13.380
Good to be connected with you.

00:13.380 --> 00:16.960
Let's start this week with the big news from Lenovo for Ubuntu users.

00:16.960 --> 00:22.300
What Canonical says is 30 Lenovo ThinkPad and ThinkStation machines, and looking down

00:22.300 --> 00:30.320
the list, it's all of the ThinkPads that I can think of, the P series, the X series,

00:30.320 --> 00:31.680
the T series, and also the desktops as well.

00:31.680 --> 00:35.840
So this is a good chunk of machines from Lenovo, pre-installed with Ubuntu 20.04.

00:35.840 --> 00:37.520
Yeah, it's not just laptops.

00:37.520 --> 00:42.080
It's also the ThinkStations, the ThinkPad P series plus 14 additional ThinkPad T, X

00:42.080 --> 00:44.400
and X1 and L series models.

00:44.400 --> 00:49.080
But what is also notable is this is really building on a program that was internal to

00:49.080 --> 00:52.520
Lenovo but difficult for consumers to get access to.

00:52.520 --> 00:56.060
You had to go through a business rep, et cetera, and was only still even more limited devices.

00:56.060 --> 00:58.040
But now they seem to be widening this up.

00:58.040 --> 01:03.920
In fact, there's a quote from Lenovo's vice president of PCSD software and cloud.

01:03.920 --> 01:08.600
And it reads, our goal is to remove the complexity and provide the Linux community with the premium

01:08.600 --> 01:11.480
experience that our customers know us for.

01:11.480 --> 01:15.560
This is why we have taken the next step to offer Linux ready devices right out of the

01:15.560 --> 01:16.560
box.

01:16.560 --> 01:21.320
And of course, this follows on from the recent Fedora machines that Lenovo announced.

01:21.320 --> 01:25.200
So now you've got a choice of Fedora or Ubuntu pre-installed, which is pretty cool.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.200
Right.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.720
Now, not all of the devices are available yet.

01:28.720 --> 01:31.360
And I think that's probably true for the Fedora side of things as well still.

01:31.360 --> 01:37.880
But this is a global rollout that will continue through 2020 and phases of 2021 even.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.720
And this is excellent news for the Linux desktop.

01:40.720 --> 01:46.160
Of course, it's nice to have a big OEM like Lenovo shipping pre-installed laptops.

01:46.160 --> 01:52.020
But what you have to understand here is that Lenovo have paid Canonical in order to certify

01:52.020 --> 01:53.020
these machines.

01:53.020 --> 01:54.080
That's how it works.

01:54.080 --> 01:57.480
They have this lab in Taipei, Canonical.

01:57.480 --> 02:00.080
And if you want to get your hardware certified, you have to pay them.

02:00.080 --> 02:05.480
And my understanding is it's quite a lot of money and each individual device costs a certain

02:05.480 --> 02:06.480
amount.

02:06.480 --> 02:11.480
I would imagine a deal was done, but still that is money going into Canonical for what

02:11.480 --> 02:14.200
is essentially Linux desktop.

02:14.200 --> 02:19.620
And so come the IPO or the sale or whatever happens, these are going to be good numbers

02:19.620 --> 02:23.840
to point to on spreadsheets to say that the desktop is making money.

02:23.840 --> 02:28.760
And so fears of them abandoning it in favor of just cloud and IoT and everything, I think

02:28.760 --> 02:30.240
are unwarranted.

02:30.240 --> 02:33.560
Reading this news gave me a big smile.

02:33.560 --> 02:38.440
In the past, we have missed opportunities during certain industry transitions.

02:38.440 --> 02:43.680
And right now, desktop Linux, especially on the laptops, is looking real good.

02:43.680 --> 02:49.520
And let's just say hypothetically, there is a small percentage of MacBook Pro users that

02:49.520 --> 02:53.840
don't want to switch to ARM, maybe because their end target that they're developing for

02:53.840 --> 02:54.840
is on x86.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.160
They want to stay on the x86 platform.

02:57.160 --> 03:01.920
Why not move to the Linux that they're running in the cloud since they don't like the direction

03:01.920 --> 03:03.160
Apple's going?

03:03.160 --> 03:06.760
In the past, we had some transitions like Unity to GNOME Shell that didn't go very well.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.920
And we lost a lot of users to macOS, in my opinion.

03:09.920 --> 03:13.960
But this time around, we've got some great systems from Lenovo now.

03:13.960 --> 03:19.320
You've got great systems from independent Linux providers like System76 and Entraware.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.840
And Dell is really at the top of their game.

03:21.840 --> 03:28.280
I have right now in the studio the Dell Precision 5750, in for review, that will feature on

03:28.280 --> 03:30.520
a future Linux Unplugged.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.360
This is a seriously powerful system.

03:32.360 --> 03:35.440
I mean, this is the peak of what I've ever seen Dell build.

03:35.440 --> 03:39.360
And I feel like we have a lot of really good answers for people that maybe are ready for

03:39.360 --> 03:41.420
a little hardware variety.

03:41.420 --> 03:45.560
And instead of only one hardware, one OS, they can switch to Linux and choose the hardware

03:45.560 --> 03:46.880
platform they want.

03:46.880 --> 03:51.600
And oh, by the way, look at all these great options, which are, oh, by the way, once again,

03:51.600 --> 03:53.880
targeted right at developers in the DevOps market.

03:53.880 --> 03:54.880
Yeah.

03:54.880 --> 03:58.040
And instead of having to try and convince the IT department that you're going to install

03:58.040 --> 04:03.540
a separate operating system on the machine that they provide for you, which often doesn't

04:03.540 --> 04:09.360
go well, I hear, this is pre-installed with support from the OEM.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.580
There's nothing third party about it.

04:11.580 --> 04:15.440
This is a proper certified Linux machine.

04:15.440 --> 04:16.440
Right?

04:16.440 --> 04:21.360
I absolutely, absolutely got the OK from IT one time because I was able to point to Dell's

04:21.360 --> 04:23.960
website and say, look, they sell machines with this now.

04:23.960 --> 04:27.840
Yeah, but then you presumably installed Arch or something instead of Ubuntu.

04:27.840 --> 04:28.840
You know, I did.

04:28.840 --> 04:33.280
I also got a ThinkPad.

04:33.280 --> 04:34.280
But you get the idea.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.800
It did make my case.

04:35.800 --> 04:40.240
Now let's talk about the case for Endeavor OS on ARM devices, which landed this week.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.240
Yeah.

04:41.240 --> 04:47.160
Along with the September release of the x86 version, which I tried and was solid as ever,

04:47.160 --> 04:49.720
they are now supporting ARM devices.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.640
Only a few to start with.

04:51.640 --> 04:57.480
Three Odroid devices, the Raspberry Pi 4B, which I think most people will be trying this

04:57.480 --> 04:58.480
on.

04:58.480 --> 05:03.080
And they offer some instructions for some other devices like the Pinebook Pro.

05:03.080 --> 05:08.480
But right now, the kind of official support is the Odroid and Raspberry Pi devices.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.720
And I tried it on a Raspberry Pi 4.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.360
Unfortunately, it's not just an image that you flash.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.800
You have to jump through a few hoops to get it working.

05:15.800 --> 05:22.520
But at the end of it, I had an XFCE desktop on top of Arch with the Endeavor OS theming

05:22.520 --> 05:23.520
and it looked pretty nice.

05:23.520 --> 05:25.300
I got to say, I don't get it.

05:25.300 --> 05:31.560
With all the love to Endeavor OS and its predecessor, Integra, I'm not really getting this one.

05:31.560 --> 05:35.680
So the few steps that you have to take is you get Arch going on a Raspberry Pi, which

05:35.680 --> 05:42.720
granted, isn't complicated, but isn't a sentence that you're going to want to tell most users,

05:42.720 --> 05:44.360
at least beginning users.

05:44.360 --> 05:47.960
And then you set up some repos and point a shell script and let the magic script set

05:47.960 --> 05:49.440
up the rest of the system for you.

05:49.440 --> 05:55.120
And then you end up essentially with an Endeavor OS desktop that's been converted from Arch.

05:55.120 --> 06:00.360
Not a big fan of converting a base install over to something else post-install a number

06:00.360 --> 06:05.360
A, and number B, if you will.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.360
Now I'm in.

06:06.360 --> 06:10.440
Manjaro, just you get Arch and you flash it right to the SD card and go.

06:10.440 --> 06:16.580
Or Raspberry Pi OS, or any other basic distro that you can get going on the Pi.

06:16.580 --> 06:20.000
You just flash the image and go and that's kind of one of my favorite things is it reminds

06:20.000 --> 06:24.900
me of the floppy disk era where I'd have a boot disk and I would just boot from that.

06:24.900 --> 06:30.080
And in this case, I would have to set aside these SD cards with this Arch environment

06:30.080 --> 06:36.360
that's ready to go and I just don't really see the value of it other than really, really

06:36.360 --> 06:37.360
early testing.

06:37.360 --> 06:43.180
Well, I'm going to defend it then because this is not an ordinary Arch install, which

06:43.180 --> 06:46.280
is not particularly difficult, but it is very time consuming and you have to follow the

06:46.280 --> 06:48.640
instructions or learn how to do it.

06:48.640 --> 06:52.000
And OK, once people are practiced at it, they can do it really quickly or whatever.

06:52.000 --> 06:59.440
But for the average person who wants a relatively vanilla Arch installation with XFCE, this

06:59.440 --> 07:05.840
is very, very easy to do, much, much easier than messing around with a normal Arch installation.

07:05.840 --> 07:10.880
All you have to do is clone the Git repository, run one script which flashes it onto the SD

07:10.880 --> 07:17.060
card, put that into the Pi, configure it a little bit, which is all just self explanatory,

07:17.060 --> 07:21.280
and then clone another Git repository, run another script, wait, and then boom, you've

07:21.280 --> 07:23.120
got it all done.

07:23.120 --> 07:27.080
It's much like Endeavor OS X86 version.

07:27.080 --> 07:32.800
It's just giving you a convenient way to get more or less vanilla Arch and Manjaro is great,

07:32.800 --> 07:34.260
but it's not vanilla Arch, is it?

07:34.260 --> 07:37.160
It's Arch with a bunch of value add.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.600
I agree there's value to that.

07:38.600 --> 07:43.120
I also like the idea of being able to get Arch up and going on a Pi a little bit faster.

07:43.120 --> 07:47.460
But I'm going to just say I think you probably lose 90 percent of the people at clone the

07:47.460 --> 07:48.460
Git repo.

07:48.460 --> 07:49.460
Yeah, I know.

07:49.460 --> 07:54.860
Well, yeah, this is not for people who want to use a GUI to flash the SD card and then

07:54.860 --> 07:56.080
just get going straight away.

07:56.080 --> 08:00.560
This is for people who have some experience with Arch, but just want a shortcut.

08:00.560 --> 08:04.600
Yeah, I think the thing that kind of puts me off about it and one of the reasons I don't

08:04.600 --> 08:11.640
run vanilla Arch on my Pis is unfortunately, the sad truth is these ARM devices are still

08:11.640 --> 08:17.040
not in a general universal state where you can throw any distro at them.

08:17.040 --> 08:23.440
You need, I think, still some upstream curation that is packaging things specifically for

08:23.440 --> 08:29.600
the Pi or even maybe making deals with certain vendors, sort of the value add that Manjaro

08:29.600 --> 08:35.720
brings to Arch on ARM or Ubuntu brings to Debian on ARM, et cetera.

08:35.720 --> 08:41.400
These vendors at this level are actually really adding usable value in this area.

08:41.400 --> 08:45.800
And sometimes they make it even possible to use certain hardware aspects of the device

08:45.800 --> 08:49.160
that aren't enabled by default with the more basic distributions.

08:49.160 --> 08:52.680
Arch is a bit of an edge case because it has such a modern kernel that it almost immediately

08:52.680 --> 08:56.800
has everything upstream that these other projects are working on, but I still kind of feel like

08:56.800 --> 08:59.660
we're in that transitionary phase.

08:59.660 --> 09:04.280
Maybe by the time 2021 rolls around or the next Raspberry Pi comes around, I won't feel

09:04.280 --> 09:05.280
this way.

09:05.280 --> 09:09.360
But right now, if I'm running a Raspberry Pi and I'm going to use it in production,

09:09.360 --> 09:12.600
there's really only two Linux distributions I'm running on there at the moment because

09:12.600 --> 09:16.320
I'm not a big fan of Raspberry Pi OS directly, just not for me.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.340
It's great for new users, but it's not just really targeted at me.

09:19.340 --> 09:23.040
So I'm sticking with either Ubuntu 2004 LTS or Manjaro.

09:23.040 --> 09:26.720
And I think if you're not running those distros, there's things that just kind of lack or are

09:26.720 --> 09:27.720
missing.

09:27.720 --> 09:28.960
Yeah, that's definitely true.

09:28.960 --> 09:33.720
Like hardware acceleration and things like that are just not quite there with the other

09:33.720 --> 09:34.720
distros.

09:34.720 --> 09:39.920
So yeah, I do take the point, but some people just want to run relatively vanilla Arch and

09:39.920 --> 09:42.480
choice is good is kind of where I'm coming from.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.480
But yeah, you are right, ultimately.

09:44.480 --> 09:49.960
Well choice is good, and that's why Microsoft is releasing Edge for Linux, at least in beta

09:49.960 --> 09:50.960
next month.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.920
Yeah, we've kind of been expecting this for a while.

09:52.920 --> 09:56.240
We knew earlier this year that it was going to come to Linux.

09:56.240 --> 10:01.060
And even when it was first announced on Windows that it was going to be based on Chromium,

10:01.060 --> 10:03.440
we thought, well, there's a good chance it will come to Linux.

10:03.440 --> 10:07.480
Well now we have a date, or at least a month, and that is next month, October.

10:07.480 --> 10:12.000
And we also have a little bit of information about the packaging now.

10:12.000 --> 10:17.280
It's going to be available as either an RPM or a Deb, not a snap though, which I'm surprised

10:17.280 --> 10:20.600
about because of Microsoft's relationship with Canonical.

10:20.600 --> 10:28.200
I think this is a very easy story for the Linux enthusiast to dismiss because who amongst

10:28.200 --> 10:33.080
us is likely going to opt to use Edge?

10:33.080 --> 10:40.240
Probably not many, but this may be one of the biggest tells in what Microsoft's direction

10:40.240 --> 10:43.840
is that we have seen since they started to love Linux.

10:43.840 --> 10:46.280
This is a huge data point.

10:46.280 --> 10:51.440
And I want to get into this for a moment because I think this indicates a global strategy by

10:51.440 --> 10:52.920
Microsoft that we should talk about.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.320
So let's start with what we know here.

10:55.320 --> 11:01.200
Edge's value from Microsoft, they have said this directly, is that this is the business

11:01.200 --> 11:02.200
browser.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.000
Yeah, that's how they actually position it as.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.600
Edge is the Chrome for business.

11:07.600 --> 11:11.960
So they kind of have acknowledged that the blink engine seems to be the way to go.

11:11.960 --> 11:16.880
So now the value that Microsoft feels like they can bring is, we'll adult up Chrome.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.480
We'll get it ready for the enterprise.

11:18.480 --> 11:21.040
This is Chromium, but for the enterprise.

11:21.040 --> 11:25.600
Now that's something because Chromium is an open source project.

11:25.600 --> 11:32.340
And it's Microsoft signaling that we can take open source or free software and we can package

11:32.340 --> 11:35.600
it up and we can deliver it for enterprise.

11:35.600 --> 11:40.480
And it's perfectly leveraging their brand, which is known for building things for enterprise

11:40.480 --> 11:41.480
customers.

11:41.480 --> 11:47.140
And I think it betrays an insecurity that is deep inside a lot of large old school corporations

11:47.140 --> 11:49.220
that CTOs and others hold.

11:49.220 --> 11:55.340
And that is that free software isn't enterprise ready, that it needs to be packaged up and

11:55.340 --> 11:56.360
sold to them.

11:56.360 --> 11:58.800
And that's what Microsoft can come along and do.

11:58.800 --> 12:02.520
And if you think about it, there's no reason that this logic can't apply to anything in

12:02.520 --> 12:04.780
open source and free software.

12:04.780 --> 12:08.760
Anything where there's an opportunity to come along and package up, say the work of Google

12:08.760 --> 12:14.920
in this case, and add value that resonates for their customers is going to be an easy

12:14.920 --> 12:15.960
slam dunk.

12:15.960 --> 12:22.360
And so by bringing Edge over to Linux, what they are saying is, business world, you will

12:22.360 --> 12:27.040
now have one browser to focus your support on, one browser to focus your security policies

12:27.040 --> 12:28.580
and your manuals on.

12:28.580 --> 12:34.080
You can standardize on Edge, which will be compatible with anything that works with Chromium.

12:34.080 --> 12:35.200
It's business safe.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.840
Yeah, that's clearly the market they're going after.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.160
But I think the enthusiasts are not going to be having this.

12:41.160 --> 12:44.320
It's weird that a lot of people will just install Chrome without thinking, and that's

12:44.320 --> 12:47.840
just a random proprietary deb or IPM or whatever.

12:47.840 --> 12:49.880
But somehow they don't trust Microsoft.

12:49.880 --> 12:55.600
And you asked us this week, I think it was in Slack, who would you prefer to trust?

12:55.600 --> 12:59.800
Or who do you trust the most out of Google and Microsoft?

12:59.800 --> 13:01.840
And I thought about it, and I don't know.

13:01.840 --> 13:06.960
I think ultimately, Google probably, because they know all my stuff anyway, they know everything

13:06.960 --> 13:07.960
about me.

13:07.960 --> 13:08.960
Yeah, that surprised me.

13:08.960 --> 13:09.960
It was a good answer.

13:09.960 --> 13:14.320
It's like, well, I've already revealed everything to Google, so now why reveal something to

13:14.320 --> 13:15.320
Microsoft?

13:15.320 --> 13:20.760
And well, linked in the show notes to a research paper on the telemetry and identity tracking

13:20.760 --> 13:22.040
that Edge apparently does.

13:22.040 --> 13:25.560
I can't speak authoritatively to it, but we will have some data there.

13:25.560 --> 13:30.120
Now, I thought about that, too, and I thought, yeah, but.

13:30.120 --> 13:36.920
The thing is, Google is institutionally aligned to exploit that data.

13:36.920 --> 13:41.960
It's literally in the fabric of the company to exploit and utilize data.

13:41.960 --> 13:47.600
Whereas Microsoft, kind of like Apple, but not nearly as severe, is not a data first

13:47.600 --> 13:48.600
company.

13:48.600 --> 13:52.400
They have quickly figured out how to utilize it, especially in terms of bug metrics and

13:52.400 --> 13:54.280
Windows data collection metrics.

13:54.280 --> 13:58.980
But if you look at the information that Microsoft supposedly has been collecting now for years

13:58.980 --> 14:06.220
from Windows Vista on, I don't see them building the same personalized systems and ad curation

14:06.220 --> 14:08.520
systems that I see coming from Google.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.960
It sort of seems like it's just sitting in a SQL database somewhere, and I'm not saying

14:11.960 --> 14:18.200
I'm comfortable with it, but I may actually trust Microsoft's incompetence to execute

14:18.200 --> 14:23.080
on the data more than I trust Google with my data, because I know Google will execute

14:23.080 --> 14:24.480
and do something with that data.

14:24.480 --> 14:28.440
Yeah, I suppose Microsoft's a bit of a halfway house, because they do have ads in Windows

14:28.440 --> 14:30.360
10 in the start menu and stuff.

14:30.360 --> 14:35.000
So they do try at least with that stuff, but yeah, I think you're right that Google does

14:35.000 --> 14:39.480
a lot better of a job with your data and targeting ads and everything.

14:39.480 --> 14:43.480
It's funny, you know, speaking of Microsoft, Eric Raymond wrote a piece this week about

14:43.480 --> 14:48.400
the desktop wars, pretty much agreeing with what I'd said that Microsoft's end goal is

14:48.400 --> 14:51.560
to pretty much move to a Linux-based system.

14:51.560 --> 14:55.520
Ooh, that really seems still far out there, but this is his pitch.

14:55.520 --> 15:01.320
He says, Microsoft Windows becomes a proton-like emulation layer over a Linux kernel, with

15:01.320 --> 15:05.760
the layer getting thinner over time as more of the support lands in the mainline kernel

15:05.760 --> 15:06.760
sources.

15:06.760 --> 15:13.380
Which, to his point here, Joe, we have seen kernel patches to improve WSL support land.

15:13.380 --> 15:18.000
We haven't seen them integrated yet, but we have seen them sent in for review.

15:18.000 --> 15:22.160
He goes on to say here, though, that the economic motive is that Microsoft sheds an even larger

15:22.160 --> 15:27.280
fraction of its development costs, and less and less has to be done in-house.

15:27.280 --> 15:30.560
So I guess the argument here could be, look at the advantage they have with taking the

15:30.560 --> 15:33.960
Blink source code and Chromium.

15:33.960 --> 15:39.280
They saved years of having to invent a new web engine, and that's even after they invested

15:39.280 --> 15:42.120
decades into Triton.

15:42.120 --> 15:46.680
So could you imagine the cost if they had to invest another couple of decades into an

15:46.680 --> 15:48.280
entirely new web engine?

15:48.280 --> 15:50.080
Instead, they can just take Chromium.

15:50.080 --> 15:53.840
Yeah, I think it's still out there, and I don't think it's that likely.

15:53.840 --> 15:58.800
Definitely not anytime soon, but it's interesting to read that just a few days after I had said

15:58.800 --> 15:59.960
something quite similar.

15:59.960 --> 16:04.040
Yeah, he says the best evidence is the fact that Microsoft has done this with Edge.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.700
He says it only makes sense that, as part of this, this is a test to get Windows users

16:07.700 --> 16:12.600
using software on both platforms, and that he had envisions that eventually you would

16:12.600 --> 16:16.320
just remove aspects of the emulation layer and more and more become native until it's

16:16.320 --> 16:17.840
just the really Edge case applications.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.440
He kind of wraps it up as this.

16:19.440 --> 16:24.160
He says the end state is the new Windows is mostly a Linux kernel.

16:24.160 --> 16:28.160
There's an old Windows emulation over it, but Edge and the rest of the Windows user

16:28.160 --> 16:30.600
land utilities don't use emulation.

16:30.600 --> 16:35.160
That emulation layer is there only for games and legacy third-party software.

16:35.160 --> 16:39.960
He says economic pressure alone will cause this and also cause Microsoft to deprecate

16:39.960 --> 16:46.040
the emulation layer over time to the point where third-party software providers will

16:46.040 --> 16:52.680
stop shipping Windows binaries in favor of ELF binaries with a pure Linux API, and that

16:52.680 --> 16:56.840
essentially Windows will get co-opted, and that's how Linux will win the desktop war

16:56.840 --> 17:00.120
is kind of by just taking it all over.

17:00.120 --> 17:05.120
Well, like I say, dare to dream.

17:05.120 --> 17:06.400
Linux.ting.com.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.320
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

17:08.320 --> 17:09.840
You pay for what you use.

17:09.840 --> 17:12.000
Nationwide coverage, three carriers to choose from.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.640
I'm on Verizon right now.

17:13.640 --> 17:14.640
And no contracts.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.680
They don't get you locked into something.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.380
And honestly, if you can, bring your device.

17:19.380 --> 17:22.560
If you go to linux.ting.com, click on the check your phone.

17:22.560 --> 17:26.320
And when you go there, you just put in the information about your phone, and they'll

17:26.320 --> 17:29.000
tell you what your situation is compatibility-wise.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.800
If you have a compatible device, that's the way to go because you'll get a $25 service

17:33.800 --> 17:37.960
credit, and that's likely to pay for more than your first month.

17:37.960 --> 17:44.120
Average Ting bill for a line after your usage is $24, and you can get a device directly

17:44.120 --> 17:47.040
from Ting as well if you think maybe it's time.

17:47.040 --> 17:51.400
They've got everything from the Pixel 4a and the iPhone SE directly, and of course the

17:51.400 --> 17:54.040
latest Moto and Galaxy phones.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.080
But they also have the new mobile.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.080
Check out the new mobile device.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.600
I know, I'd never heard of it either.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.980
I had not heard of it, but it's $79 brand new.

18:01.980 --> 18:07.120
But if you go to linux.ting.com, they'll give you $25 towards a new device.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.080
You can get this brand new flip phone.

18:10.080 --> 18:15.240
It's a flip phone with like forever battery, LTE data support.

18:15.240 --> 18:20.040
It's actually pretty great, and you can once again flip the phone down to hang up on people.

18:20.040 --> 18:23.320
It's got a front-facing screen too with just a basic clock on it, but what else do you

18:23.320 --> 18:24.320
need?

18:24.320 --> 18:28.080
And it's got a camera, so should the worst happen, you need to take a picture of it,

18:28.080 --> 18:29.360
you can do it.

18:29.360 --> 18:32.440
You can go simple with Ting, or you can go as luxury as you want.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.580
Get started at linux.ting.com.

18:34.580 --> 18:39.340
Go over there, read a little bit about it, see how they do things a little differently,

18:39.340 --> 18:42.600
take their control panel, which I don't know why the rest of the industry hasn't ripped

18:42.600 --> 18:43.600
this thing off.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.000
Their dashboard is the best.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.200
You can see all your usage at a glance, you can take complete control, you can set usage

18:48.200 --> 18:52.280
alerts, you can nickname lines, so if you've got a couple of lines for your kids or a partner,

18:52.280 --> 18:54.520
it's super easy to keep track of everything.

18:54.520 --> 18:59.280
And when you need help, either in the app or on the phone, there's a real person there

18:59.280 --> 19:00.280
to help you.

19:00.280 --> 19:05.320
So get started at linux.ting.com, support the show, and get a $25 service credit or

19:05.320 --> 19:08.240
$25 towards your first device.

19:08.240 --> 19:11.980
That's linux.ting.com.

19:11.980 --> 19:16.520
Another week and another project that is being spun out of Mozilla.

19:16.520 --> 19:19.960
And this time it's Mozilla Web Things, their Internet of Things platform.

19:19.960 --> 19:24.520
Yeah, there seems to be two trajectories at this point for a former Mozilla project.

19:24.520 --> 19:29.000
Either they just shut it down completely like we saw recently with Firefox Send and Firefox

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Notes.

19:30.000 --> 19:34.620
And yeah, maybe the code's available, but as a project and a structure and an organization,

19:34.620 --> 19:35.720
it is no more.

19:35.720 --> 19:39.720
And then you have the Web Things and some of the other projects we're out, which there

19:39.720 --> 19:43.820
seems to have been enough momentum and enough adoption that they can survive independently

19:43.820 --> 19:45.720
of the Mozilla organization.

19:45.720 --> 19:48.400
And that's what's happening here with Web Things.

19:48.400 --> 19:53.360
David Bryant writes on the Mozilla discourse, we're writing to inform you that the Web Things

19:53.360 --> 19:57.960
project is being spun out of Mozilla as an independent open source project.

19:57.960 --> 20:02.360
Mozilla is winding down its direct involvement with Web Things and is transitioning control

20:02.360 --> 20:05.340
and responsibility to the community.

20:05.340 --> 20:11.280
Web Things is what powers a gateway that runs on your LAN that controls your IoT devices.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.100
So they don't have to rely on cloud services.

20:14.100 --> 20:17.720
Similar to how I use Home Assistant, Web Things was another option.

20:17.720 --> 20:22.640
Now the good news here, Joe, is that it does seem to be like a transition path to the community

20:22.640 --> 20:23.640
supported version.

20:23.640 --> 20:28.780
So if people are using Web Things right now as an IoT gateway, they're not SOL.

20:28.780 --> 20:31.300
Their support will continue, I guess I should say.

20:31.300 --> 20:33.000
Why did you never use this then?

20:33.000 --> 20:36.040
The same way I've picked a lot of open source projects in the past thinking about it, it's

20:36.040 --> 20:37.360
started with the community.

20:37.360 --> 20:40.920
There was just a lot of community activity around Home Assistant.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.200
There was a lot of excitement in our audience.

20:43.200 --> 20:47.100
And you know how it goes when you start getting messages that are like, hey, you should really

20:47.100 --> 20:48.660
check this thing out over here.

20:48.660 --> 20:49.660
Have you seen this?

20:49.660 --> 20:52.640
You get a couple of those and another couple of days go by and you get a couple more and

20:52.640 --> 20:53.740
you're like, oh, maybe there is something.

20:53.740 --> 20:56.640
So Home Assistant had that going for it.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.400
There's other ones like this, too.

20:58.400 --> 21:03.080
There's platforms from Dell and the Linux Foundation that were created, and I haven't

21:03.080 --> 21:06.400
seen a big uptick in that adoption either.

21:06.400 --> 21:12.360
And it really kind of seems like what happened was is these projects were created and they

21:12.360 --> 21:18.200
are successful to a degree, but their success is limited in how much they can integrate

21:18.200 --> 21:20.640
with proprietary solutions.

21:20.640 --> 21:23.480
That's something else that Home Assistant is really good at, is there's thousands of

21:23.480 --> 21:28.920
different integrations to plug in with cloud providers that don't even necessarily have

21:28.920 --> 21:33.200
an API, to cloud providers that do, to devices that are local, to devices that are cloud

21:33.200 --> 21:34.200
controlled.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.300
It can work with all of it.

21:36.300 --> 21:41.240
And it just seems to have a really wide range of support because of that community.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.840
Where some of these other things like web things were a little more limited in their

21:43.840 --> 21:50.020
scope and not as easy to just throw on a Raspberry Pi or a VM or something you just tossed in

21:50.020 --> 21:53.960
Docker real quick and then it just auto-discovered all these devices on your network.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.760
They all have various versions of this.

21:55.760 --> 21:58.080
I was just never impressed by what web things offered.

21:58.080 --> 22:00.720
But I know it works for some people and I know it's great in some business solutions,

22:00.720 --> 22:01.720
too.

22:01.720 --> 22:02.720
It just wasn't hitting my buttons.

22:02.720 --> 22:06.760
But the good news is, as you said, they're not just abandoning this.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.560
They are going to hand it over to the community.

22:09.560 --> 22:17.160
And even if you've got a MozillaIoT.org subdomain with them, that will still be available until

22:17.160 --> 22:18.160
the end of the year.

22:18.160 --> 22:23.040
Yeah, that seems to be the most abrupt change here is if you are taking advantage of that

22:23.040 --> 22:29.040
MozillaIoT.org domain, you've got essentially a few months as we record this.

22:29.040 --> 22:32.760
And then I'd say the other thing you need to look out for is the project will have to

22:32.760 --> 22:35.920
transition how it issues updates.

22:35.920 --> 22:40.920
And those updates, instead of coming from Mozilla, will come from the project now.

22:40.920 --> 22:44.760
And so you'll have to opt into that, but they'll have more information on how you'll do that

22:44.760 --> 22:45.760
soon.

22:45.760 --> 22:49.920
And that's ultimately just part of a trend that we've been seeing for quite some time

22:49.920 --> 22:52.120
where Mozilla just has to tighten the purse strings.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.160
They can't have too many of these projects, seemingly.

22:55.160 --> 22:58.360
They have to just shut them down and make sure they're not spending too much.

22:58.360 --> 22:59.360
I wish that were true, Joe.

22:59.360 --> 23:03.360
I wish what we saw here with Mozilla was a group that recognized the dire situation their

23:03.360 --> 23:10.200
Firefox web browser is in and were taking keen, decisive action to, as they like to

23:10.200 --> 23:15.000
say, forgive the expression because I think it's awful in this case, trim the fat.

23:15.000 --> 23:19.240
And they were just focusing on making Firefox as great as possible.

23:19.240 --> 23:21.600
But that's not what we're seeing here.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.480
That's what's so frustrating is another announcement from Mozilla this week is they're launching

23:25.480 --> 23:33.440
the European AI Fund, which is a ton of money, $1.6 million.

23:33.440 --> 23:38.480
They're dumping into this thing and it's completely 100% a social and political play.

23:38.480 --> 23:41.600
There is nothing about making Firefox better.

23:41.600 --> 23:45.200
Are they actually investing any money in this, though, because they say in its first step,

23:45.200 --> 23:49.640
the fund will launch with a 1 million euro open call for funding.

23:49.640 --> 23:52.320
Doesn't that mean that they're looking for funding from elsewhere?

23:52.320 --> 23:53.320
Or the partners.

23:53.320 --> 23:59.040
It's a group of national, regional, international partners that are participating in this.

23:59.040 --> 24:03.800
And it seems Mozilla is in the driver's seat, at least to a significant degree here, because

24:03.800 --> 24:08.300
the shared project site shares a lot of language that's on the Mozilla announcement.

24:08.300 --> 24:10.520
The two mirror each other a lot.

24:10.520 --> 24:14.360
The reason why they're doing this and organizing this and putting all of their energy and effort

24:14.360 --> 24:18.960
and time, which is money as well, into this is they say, we seek to deepen the pool of

24:18.960 --> 24:24.240
experts across Europe who have the tools capacity know how to catalog and monitor social and

24:24.240 --> 24:30.000
political impact of AI and data driven interventions and hold them accountable for it.

24:30.000 --> 24:34.160
With this group of national and regional international foundations in Europe that will be dedicated

24:34.160 --> 24:39.400
to using their resources, financial and otherwise, to strengthen civil society.

24:39.400 --> 24:42.040
I mean, this sounds great, really.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.600
But this sounds like the kind of stuff that Apple should be doing.

24:45.600 --> 24:50.960
But Mozilla is a struggling company to even get users to even open their core product

24:50.960 --> 24:51.960
at this point.

24:51.960 --> 24:52.960
That's the reality we're at here.

24:52.960 --> 24:57.000
They continue on making it clear that this entire effort is about social issues with

24:57.000 --> 24:59.120
at Mozilla.

24:59.120 --> 25:04.520
We've seen firsthand the expertise that civil society can provide when it comes to the intersection

25:04.520 --> 25:09.900
of AI, consumer rights, racial justice and economic justice.

25:09.900 --> 25:14.080
We've collaborated closely over the years with partners like the European Digital Rights,

25:14.080 --> 25:17.940
Access Now Algorithm Watch and Digital Freedom Fund.

25:17.940 --> 25:19.960
So I looked into some of these groups and I'm not impressed, Joe.

25:19.960 --> 25:23.640
I mean, I sent you some of the things I found about these groups and none of this really

25:23.640 --> 25:27.840
seems to benefit Mozilla in the long term or Firefox.

25:27.840 --> 25:30.120
It is high gold, high moral.

25:30.120 --> 25:35.800
It's something that I can appreciate that they're putting effort into, but it just doesn't

25:35.800 --> 25:39.120
seem to match up with laying off over 200 developers.

25:39.120 --> 25:42.160
It doesn't seem to match up with cutting all of the projects.

25:42.160 --> 25:45.640
It doesn't seem to match up with all of the things we've seen about the slide in their

25:45.640 --> 25:48.480
market share and what they're trying to do to make that better.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.620
I don't get it.

25:49.620 --> 25:51.800
It's like they don't even realize the situation they're in.

25:51.800 --> 25:52.800
Yeah.

25:52.800 --> 25:59.080
When I was reading about this, it did strike me, as a friend of mine would say, a tea-drinking,

25:59.080 --> 26:05.720
leak-eating boondoggle, which is just sort of bureaucracy for its own sake almost.

26:05.720 --> 26:12.180
It won't necessarily achieve much beyond just more bureaucracy, which Mozilla just seems

26:12.180 --> 26:13.280
to be bogged down in.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.280
Yeah.

26:14.280 --> 26:19.260
Well, another story we've been following over the last couple of years is open source business

26:19.260 --> 26:22.100
models in the cloud era.

26:22.100 --> 26:28.000
This week, TimescaleDB have updated their license to hopefully find a good compromise.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.880
Yeah, I really like what's in here.

26:30.880 --> 26:34.240
I'm going to say that up front because I'm also going to have a little fun at their expense.

26:34.240 --> 26:37.720
If you're not familiar with TimescaleDB, it's pretty slick.

26:37.720 --> 26:43.420
It offers massive scale, hundreds of billions of rows and millions of inserts per second

26:43.420 --> 26:44.960
on a single server.

26:44.960 --> 26:48.760
We're talking like there's definitely a use case for this, especially at really large

26:48.760 --> 26:49.760
scale.

26:49.760 --> 26:54.560
That's why its developer community includes engineers from Rackspace, IBM, DigitalOcean,

26:54.560 --> 26:59.480
Samsung, Siemens, Uber, Walmart, Warner Music, thousands of large companies that just have

26:59.480 --> 27:03.560
these massive data transactions use TimescaleDB.

27:03.560 --> 27:07.440
It's a pretty important player, and it was one of the early ones to start experimenting

27:07.440 --> 27:08.560
with this.

27:08.560 --> 27:12.240
They landed on their license about two years ago.

27:12.240 --> 27:15.520
It's called the TSL, which stands for Timescale License.

27:15.520 --> 27:19.200
Now, here's where I'm going to have a little fun with them because they kind of really

27:19.200 --> 27:24.280
go all in on this post, kind of really patting themselves on the back for paving the way,

27:24.280 --> 27:25.280
as it were.

27:25.280 --> 27:31.800
But they write, two years later, this experiment has been so successful, exceeding our expectations,

27:31.800 --> 27:33.560
that we're changing tons of stuff.

27:33.560 --> 27:38.200
They write, this experiment has gone so well, we're announcing an update to the TSL that

27:38.200 --> 27:43.480
reinforces our commitment to the community and loosens lots of restrictions.

27:43.480 --> 27:46.800
And they throw a few things in here like, you now have the right to repair, the right

27:46.800 --> 27:48.200
to improve.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.640
All enterprise features are now free.

27:50.640 --> 27:53.600
No more usage limits and simplified legalese.

27:53.600 --> 27:54.920
I mean, check, check, check.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.540
That's all really good stuff.

27:56.540 --> 27:59.960
It's just the whole build up is about how successful it's been, but we think it needs

27:59.960 --> 28:00.960
these changes.

28:00.960 --> 28:03.960
I have to poke them a little bit of fun for that because it's essentially admitting it

28:03.960 --> 28:05.180
wasn't perfect.

28:05.180 --> 28:09.580
But now with these things in here, we may have ourselves here, Joe, a genuine model

28:09.580 --> 28:10.580
for others to follow.

28:10.580 --> 28:12.660
Yeah, that's kind of how I read it.

28:12.660 --> 28:16.760
They've managed to get the likes of Amazon to do business deals with them so that they

28:16.760 --> 28:19.520
can offer it as a service.

28:19.520 --> 28:23.080
And they've built this sustainable business model based on that.

28:23.080 --> 28:25.840
And hopefully other people will follow this.

28:25.840 --> 28:29.560
It's still not totally open source by the OSI definition.

28:29.560 --> 28:35.680
But the argument they make, which I think is pretty strong, is that the OSI model is

28:35.680 --> 28:42.720
just not fit for purpose in 2020 when we've got AWS, Azure, and GCP and all the other

28:42.720 --> 28:43.960
cloud providers.

28:43.960 --> 28:48.800
It just doesn't make sense for certain projects to have a properly free and open source license.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.160
Yeah, that's essentially it.

28:50.160 --> 28:55.080
I'll add there are a couple of clearly not allowed things that are outlined on the website

28:55.080 --> 28:56.080
here.

28:56.080 --> 29:00.000
The one that sticks out to me the most is you can't redistribute modified source code.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.880
But there's a couple others in there as well.

29:02.880 --> 29:06.520
I think that's all overshadowed by what they have allowed here.

29:06.520 --> 29:11.020
The big one that's going to have knock on ramifications for the industry is the removal

29:11.020 --> 29:12.400
of the enterprise tier.

29:12.400 --> 29:17.080
They're making all of the software under an Apache 2 or TSL license just available for

29:17.080 --> 29:18.080
free.

29:18.080 --> 29:22.400
They've got this weird tier you have to buy and they note that that actually simplifies

29:22.400 --> 29:23.400
things for them too.

29:23.400 --> 29:26.520
They don't have to have this internal debate now and which ones do we hold back for the

29:26.520 --> 29:29.360
enterprise tier and which ones do we make available for everyone.

29:29.360 --> 29:34.200
So I think that one big give here for the enterprise tier may be what really lasts as

29:34.200 --> 29:35.600
the big news ongoing.

29:35.600 --> 29:38.600
And the fact that we now have something here with the timescale license that may prove

29:38.600 --> 29:40.440
to be a sustainable license model.

29:40.440 --> 29:46.360
Yeah, and I think the key thing here is that they differentiate between a value added service

29:46.360 --> 29:47.920
and just hosting it as a service.

29:47.920 --> 29:55.760
So if you add timescale DB into your own project and build a service around that, that's fine

29:55.760 --> 29:59.360
as long as you're adding value and that's what they clearly explain.

29:59.360 --> 30:03.800
So what they've done is pretty much make it an open source license for everyone apart

30:03.800 --> 30:06.560
from the cloud providers.

30:06.560 --> 30:10.540
And I remember when we talked about this, it must've been a couple of years ago, I said

30:10.540 --> 30:15.400
someone who is much, much cleverer than I am will come up with a solution to this.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.040
And here we are a couple of years later.

30:17.040 --> 30:21.000
And I think it is the solution that they need for this.

30:21.000 --> 30:24.040
