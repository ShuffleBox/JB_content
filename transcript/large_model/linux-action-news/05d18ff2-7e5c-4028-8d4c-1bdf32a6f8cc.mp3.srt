00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,960
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,560
This is episode 48, recorded on April 8th, 2018.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,560
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,560
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,560
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,400
It's good to be connected with you, especially on a day when we've got a big show and it

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,200
starts off with a big code cleanup in the Linux kernel.

8
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:36,720
Yeah, it's dropping support for quite a few very old and obscure architectures, none of

9
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,520
which I was really very familiar with, I must say.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,640
Yeah, definitely some old hardware in here, probably things that most of us have never

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,320
even heard of, like Backfin and CRIs and FFRVs and things like that.

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,560
MR32R, obviously not very popular architectures anymore, but they had their day in the light.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,720
Now, I think we all look at this as a good thing generally when these architectures aren't

14
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,720
widely used.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,080
They're going to reduce the size of the kernel, which is always a common source of complaints.

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,080
Some say it reduces attack vector, others argue that.

17
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,420
But I think the more interesting aspect to this story is we often talk about how many

18
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,880
different architectures you can run Linux on.

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,280
We don't often talk about removing support, unless it's for like 32-bit support for x86.

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,760
This is the flip side to that, is there has to be a cleaning, a maintenance from time

21
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
to time.

22
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,380
And these are the kinds of things you never get to see in a commercial product.

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,960
It's all done behind the scenes.

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,160
But with Linux and the entire thing being done out in the open, we get to watch both

25
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,160
ends of this process.

26
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,380
Yeah, spring cleaning, if you will.

27
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,140
And it is necessary, really, you can't keep supporting these architectures forever.

28
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,520
And you mentioned 32-bit x86 there, you have to feel that that is coming.

29
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,760
Not anytime soon, you wouldn't have thought, but it can't be more than what, maybe another

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,640
10, 15 years max, really, before that's dropped, because that's just essentially obsolete.

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,880
And it's just the march of progress, isn't it?

32
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,180
These things happened.

33
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,280
And there might be a few of these systems that are still out there in embedded systems

34
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,280
or whatever.

35
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:13,420
But realistically, they can run older kernels, and maybe the last LTS or whatever, if necessary.

36
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,080
And really, how much life have they got left in them?

37
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,500
Probably not anything beyond the LTS kernel.

38
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,920
And otherwise, people just have to not really care about security if they don't want to

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
upgrade.

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,520
Well, speaking of the march of progress, we've also got to make room for new architectures.

41
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,680
We've talked about this before.

42
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,680
But this week, there's been some initial goodies landing in the most recent version of the

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Linux kernel.

44
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,560
Yeah, RISC-V, which initially landed in 4.15, there's been some improvements in 4.17.

45
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,640
And keep in mind that this is the completely open royalty-free architecture, which I've

46
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,100
been pinning my hopes on for a totally free phone and routers and stuff like that.

47
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,340
So it's really great to see that there's improvements happening already.

48
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,200
So now in Linux kernel 4.17, there's support for dynamic F trace, they did some cleanup

49
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,860
to the atomic locking code, and module support loading is now enabled by default.

50
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,360
So it's still kind of early days with the things that we're implementing.

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,880
But they're things that are necessary and good to see.

52
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,440
The market is really picking up around RISC-V. There is a lot of momentum because like Joe

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,240
said, it's open source and royalty-free.

54
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,660
And there's three companies that appear to be the leaders, and Sci-5 is the leading of

55
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,780
those three.

56
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,820
They just closed $50 million in funding for their developer board that has kind of a unique

57
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,820
twist.

58
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,960
The idea here is they're gonna take the RISC-V processor architecture, royalty-free, so they

59
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:40,960
can rebuild and sell, and they're gonna make a processor board as a platform product.

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,400
I know that sounds crazy, but in simple terms, it's an app store where you choose the functionality

61
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,120
of that system, it downloads, it configures the RISC-V system for that functionality,

62
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,640
and out of the box, Bob's your uncle, you've now got a dedicated RISC-V board for a router

63
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,200
or to run a sign, a display.

64
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,240
The idea is they can build a couple of generic systems that just need a final configuration

65
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,480
that can be applied at the software level inside the CPU, which is something that the

66
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,020
RISC-V designers have promoted pretty heavily.

67
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,400
And then they'll just have different work cases or use cases in their quote-unquote

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,360
app store that you apply, boom, right onto the silicon.

69
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:22,880
Well, $50 million of VC funding really does inspire confidence in this company.

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,880
Yeah.

71
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,720
And so I'm glad to see that you've got them really pushing this forward because, like

72
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,380
I said, this is the real hope, isn't it, for a totally free device.

73
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,980
This is their third round of funding.

74
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,760
So I don't know their totals that they've raised here, but it shows that there is a

75
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,000
lot of investor interest in this market.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,560
So this $50 million was a Series C round, so they've had an A and a B.

77
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,720
Yeah, and a pretty successful crowd funder for their development board as well.

78
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,680
So yeah, they're doing all right, which is good to see.

79
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,960
And also excellent RISC-V news this week is that Debian is now supported.

80
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,480
Yeah, 64-bit version of Debian for the RISC-V architecture.

81
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,400
It's early days, but it's essentially landed.

82
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,840
This was a post on the Debian mailing list, and it's here.

83
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,900
It's probably still got a lot of work to do, but it's actually here.

84
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,840
And it's bootable, it's unstable, but it's bootable.

85
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,200
Yeah, it's a huge step, isn't it, that we've got a real mainstream distribution that is

86
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
available.

87
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,240
As you say, early days, it's not working perfectly yet, but you know that that's just going to

88
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,020
continue to improve.

89
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,920
And we will hopefully, around the time that we've got affordable RISC-V hardware, have

90
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:35,200
a really good, solid version of Debian to run on it.

91
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,520
Speaking of kernel architectures and those architectures being free or not necessarily

92
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,000
free, how about one of the most popular architectures, x86, and running a special kernel that's going

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,880
to help you avoid all of those pesky alerts about patches for Meltdown and Spectre, amongst

94
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
other things.

95
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,260
Yeah, so the Linux Libre kernel, which is the totally blob-less, completely free software

96
00:05:55,260 --> 00:06:02,440
kernel, they've decided that they're not going to alert you about the patches for Meltdown

97
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,760
and Spectre that require the proprietary microcode.

98
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,520
So they're very much prioritizing freedom over security, which is a huge surprise.

99
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Not really.

100
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,640
So what they're doing with the GNU Linux Libre 4.16 kernel is they're taking the upstream

101
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:23,200
4.16 kernel and they're pulling out certain functionality, including just general microcode

102
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,280
update support.

103
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,400
So they're not specifically targeting Spectre and Meltdown.

104
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,600
It's just all microcode updates in the future, including future important updates, as well

105
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:37,120
as the ability to load binary-only modules, like NVIDIA drivers.

106
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,600
In the enterprise, I've had a lot of situations where a vendor has required a very specific

107
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,880
Linux kernel version and I've had to load the proprietary binary module.

108
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,000
So it sort of eliminates those use cases.

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,400
But on the other side, they have made changes to the firmware request code in the kernel,

110
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,120
potentially allowing some drivers to function better when they are capable of operating

111
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,220
without binary-only firmware in some cases.

112
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,160
So there is some take, but there's also some give.

113
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,600
And a lot of people have created a big stink about this and kind of for good reason.

114
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,560
But then again, is anybody accidentally using the Libre kernel?

115
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
I don't think so.

116
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,160
It's something that you're doing as a very conscious choice.

117
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,940
And so therefore you don't want these binaries that are proprietary and you've got no idea

118
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,600
what they're doing, even if it is going to supposedly increase your security.

119
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,680
I mean, we saw with the initial microcode updates that they were unstable and were a

120
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,280
bit useless and they ended up getting pulled.

121
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,960
So I don't think it's as much of a story as some people have made out, but it's something

122
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,360
certainly to be aware of if you are planning to use the Libre kernel.

123
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,320
Yep, I 100% agree with that.

124
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,140
You are intentionally running this kernel.

125
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,720
It's sometimes just a great way to validate that a piece of hardware like a new laptop

126
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,000
doesn't require any funky modules.

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,200
You know when you run this kernel, you are good to go if everything's working.

128
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,800
I'm not using this on my daily driver system and I'm not likely using this on a large virtual

129
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,040
environment either.

130
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,840
But it's nice to have it out there.

131
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,400
And for some folks that want raw performance without any meltdown, specter, microcode patch

132
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,600
slowdowns because they got to compute for days, this is a solution for them.

133
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,840
Yeah, who cares about security, eh?

134
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,120
dio.co slash action.

135
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,180
DigitalOcean is your cloud infrastructure on demand.

136
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,440
You can get started in seconds.

137
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,560
So when you go to dio.co slash action and sign up with a new account, you'll get $100

138
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,560
credit.

139
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,600
Now, that is a lot of DigitalOcean credit.

140
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,080
My favorite system is just three cents an hour and they've optimized the whole process

141
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,560
to save you time.

142
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,780
You can get systems up and running for testing and into production in minutes.

143
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:53,400
They have SSDs on every single system, 12 data centers all over the world, very well

144
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,120
positioned so that way you can place something near your users or near you so that way they

145
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,280
have unbelievable performance, 40 gigabit connections coming into these hypervisors,

146
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,480
Linux for the core, KVM for the virtualizer, and then a dashboard for days on top of all

147
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,040
of it, and a clear, easy to understand, well-documented API.

148
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,780
That's DigitalOcean in a snapshot, dio.co slash action.

149
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,120
You can deploy a base Linux system and build it from there or an entire application stack

150
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,760
like GitLab or Ghost, which is a killer WordPress replacement if you just need a simple, easy

151
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,920
blog or build out your entire infrastructure, host your business website.

152
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,120
Some of our favorite open source projects, entire backend and frontend, are hosted on

153
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,220
DigitalOcean, dio.co slash action.

154
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,080
Go try it out, get that $100 credit, build something fun, learn something new, and read

155
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,960
their clear documentation, dio.co slash action.

156
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,840
Okay, let's talk about Steam Machines.

157
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:54,960
This was a big story that turned out to maybe be a non-story this week, so Steam Machines

158
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,400
have disappeared from Valve's site, or at least that's what was reported, but then

159
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,920
Valve responded to that and said, no, it's fine, we're still doing it, we've just kind

160
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,480
of reorganized the site a bit, and yeah, they're not selling that well, but they're not dead,

161
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,360
it's fine, it's fine, they're not dead.

162
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,320
This is a hard one to read, so they've removed any possible way to navigate to them from

163
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,200
the front page, and they say, well, we've done that because user traffic was low.

164
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,400
Well, now user traffic's really going to be low, isn't it?

165
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,160
And it seems like maybe the solution there would be to make it more visible, but what

166
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
do I know?

167
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,200
I don't run the Steam store.

168
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,800
They also pulled down promotional language.

169
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,560
That was a little bit suspicious as well, and they did reveal that they've sold fewer

170
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,040
than 500,000 Steam Machines in seven monthish time, so that was a while ago, so we don't

171
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,560
know what the number is now, but it, in my sense, hasn't been that good.

172
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,660
So I think some of us have just sort of been anticipating this, and that's why the news

173
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,320
got so much traction, and Valve said, you know, it was just a routine cleanup, we were

174
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,400
just doing a routine cleanup, but we have taken a lot of feedback, and we've been real

175
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,080
heads down on addressing the shortcomings that we've observed with that rickety Linux.

176
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,600
Now I may have added a little emphasis there.

177
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,240
We think an important part of our efforts is our ongoing investment in making Vulkan

178
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,480
a competitive and well-supported graphics API, as well as making sure it has first-class

179
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,080
support on Linux platforms.

180
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,860
I solidly agree with that final statement there, that I completely agree with.

181
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:30,680
They essentially are trying to position as we came into this with a whole head of Steam

182
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,600
and thought we really had something great and developers were going to take off, but

183
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,520
then we realized that OpenGL was kind of crap on Linux, and then we realized that there

184
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:44,920
wasn't really a solid cross-platform competitive graphics API that competed with DirectX, so

185
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,840
we have to make that work first before we can make the whole Steam Machine thing work.

186
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,120
I do technically buy that argument.

187
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,760
I don't think it's going to work.

188
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:59,440
Do you think that anyone is really interested in running Steam games in a console-like form

189
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,440
factor?

190
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,280
It just seems that if you want to play Steam games, you're going to be doing that on a

191
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,480
PC or maybe with a PC running in a different room and then using a Steam Link.

192
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,240
I just don't see the market really for Steam Machines.

193
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,080
If you want to have a console, then people are going to get an Xbox or a PlayStation

194
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,420
or maybe even a Switch.

195
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,480
That's always been the core question with these Steam Machines, and I think the market

196
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,480
has shown us it's a bit of a mixed bag.

197
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,280
The Steam Link, as you just mentioned, has been a success for Valve, and they've sold

198
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
quite a few of them.

199
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,640
It's also about $100.

200
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,120
NVIDIA has their GeForce streaming stuff that they build into their NVIDIA cards on the

201
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,720
Windows platform and into their NVIDIA Shield TV.

202
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:46,800
You can stream from the NVIDIA Cloud PC games to an NVIDIA Shield TV.

203
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Have you tried that?

204
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,600
Because I would always worry about latency there.

205
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Yeah, it's not too bad.

206
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
You know, it really depends.

207
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,840
I am not a hardcore gamer like you are, Joe, but I didn't really have too many problems.

208
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,440
I played Batman Arkham City, and it looked great.

209
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,880
It played pretty well, but that game may be better positioned for it than sort of a twitchy

210
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,500
kind of first-person shooter where response time is really critical.

211
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
I'm not sure.

212
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,440
I can't speak to that, but it does seem that these companies are definitely pushing PC

213
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,160
games down to the TV.

214
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:23,660
Yeah, and SteamOS in and of itself was a hedge, wasn't it, against the possibility that Microsoft

215
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,000
would make it so that you could only install applications from the Microsoft App Store,

216
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
which we just haven't seen.

217
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,840
We've seen Windows 10 be as open as previous versions of Windows.

218
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,560
Open I don't mean as an open source, but I mean as in you can just download an exe and

219
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,560
run it.

220
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,200
You might get the odd warning or whatever, but you can install whatever you want.

221
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,920
And so really, SteamOS just hasn't really been relevant, has it?

222
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't know any serious gamers who aren't sort of Linux first, if you know what I mean,

223
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
who are in the slightest bit interested.

224
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,960
If you're in the Linux world and you care about software freedom and you're running

225
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:06,160
Linux as a daily driver, then it makes sense to use Steam or Linux or SteamOS possibly.

226
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:13,040
But the kind of people who only care about gaming, they just don't care at all about

227
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
SteamOS.

228
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,680
They're like, based on Linux, why would you do that?

229
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,440
I don't think it's up to them to even care.

230
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,280
It's supposed to be an implementation detail on the part of Alienware or another provider,

231
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,760
just like the Xbox is running some old version of Windows underneath, but the users don't

232
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,760
care.

233
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,560
But to go back to your point about them hedging against Windows 10, I think that's the bigger

234
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
thing.

235
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,720
If I was going to bet a beer on what's really going on, my rampant speculation and personal

236
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,480
opinion would be the Windows 10 monster did not materialize, but Valve knows Microsoft

237
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,160
well enough to know that if they said they want to do it, they at some point will likely

238
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
get around to it.

239
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,320
They just take a very slow route to ease people into it, and so it's probably worth them continuing

240
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,600
to invest.

241
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,440
There's other benefits to investing in Vulkan besides the Linux desktop and Steam machines,

242
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,000
including Android and just helping crack the DirectX dominance.

243
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,160
So I don't really fully buy that they're doing this for desktop Linux or the future of Steam

244
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,280
machines more so than it's just a way to keep a hedge going in case they have to invest

245
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,720
all of their resources.

246
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,120
They could turn this thing into a pretty solid product within six months to a year, and that's

247
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,360
probably all they really need out of it right now.

248
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,000
Yeah, back burner is the phrase for that.

249
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,440
But we'll never know because they've obviously been using encrypted messengers to plan all

250
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,280
of their Steam machines maniacal plans, Joe.

251
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,720
Well, maybe not, but it made for a segue.

252
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:41,200
Yeah, well let's hope they weren't using Tor Messenger, which three years after launching

253
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,240
was still in beta and now has been abandoned.

254
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,160
There's been a lot of things leading to this, I think, the fact that it never got out of

255
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,960
beta, the fact that it wasn't the perfect messaging client because it had a quote unquote

256
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,280
metadata problem, as the project calls it.

257
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:03,160
But the real nail in the coffin here was that it's based on a project that is no longer.

258
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:08,120
Instant Bird was an open source messaging client developed in the Mozilla community,

259
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,360
and the lead developer in that Mozilla community announced last year he was stepping down,

260
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,280
wrapping up, hanging up the keyboard, he was done with the project.

261
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,360
And that really kind of sealed the fate of Tor Messenger.

262
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:26,480
I do wonder about this sort of general distrust of Tor that I seem to pick up from a lot of

263
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:33,640
people that people know that it is possible to work out some of the traffic and where

264
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,560
the traffic's coming from and that it's not totally foolproof.

265
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,760
And that kind of undermines faith in it, really, as a platform generally.

266
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:48,060
So I wonder to what extent that stopped people from adopting it.

267
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,880
And also the fact that there's just a million other messengers out there already that people

268
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
are using.

269
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
Did they really need another one?

270
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,000
Yeah, I definitely take your point.

271
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And I think you're right.

272
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,160
I think the fact that this thing had a quote unquote metadata problem also sort of hurt

273
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,580
the brand of Tor, if you follow.

274
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,880
So this group that's supposed to be known for trying to keep you secure and private

275
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,800
online creates a messenger that essentially leaks metadata.

276
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:17,640
I mean, I use the term loosely leak, but that doesn't really play well to Tor trying to

277
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
protect your privacy.

278
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Yeah, and in the meantime, we've seen the rise of Signal, and that's become really popular

279
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,900
with people who care about privacy.

280
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,920
So I think that it probably was a wise decision to just give up on this.

281
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,300
Mozilla's got another project in the works, though, and this is one that they really seem

282
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,680
to be passionate about.

283
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,580
It's bringing augmented reality and virtual reality to Firefox.

284
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:45,700
And they appear to be doing this with a dedicated augmented reality mixed reality browser called

285
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,480
Firefox reality.

286
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:54,660
Now am I some sort of old man or is it normal to not really have much interest in a mixed

287
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,080
reality or augmented reality or virtual reality browser?

288
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:05,680
It just feels very kind of 80s movie future, doesn't it, that really, I just, if I want

289
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,840
a browser, I just want a browser.

290
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,220
I don't see why it being in AR or VR.

291
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,920
I don't see any value add there.

292
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:20,040
I know this is something they've thought a lot about because I got a demo of Firefox

293
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:26,240
web VR, I think in 2013, 2014 at OSCON at the Mozilla booth, and they've been working

294
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,880
on it since then.

295
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,960
And I think they do a really bad job of explaining why this should exist.

296
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,520
And I've criticized them on the show before about the way they communicate.

297
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,220
They communicate like they're talking from one business to another business.

298
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,740
And it's totally the elegance of what they're trying to do is totally lost in the corporate

299
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,680
speak because they wax on about the future of the web and how it's going to be heavily

300
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,820
intertwined with virtual and augmented reality.

301
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,580
And that future is going to live through the browser.

302
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:01,360
And that's why they're building Firefox reality, a new kind of web browser designed from the

303
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,480
ground up to work with standalone virtual and augmented realities.

304
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:12,520
And the real purpose of this is in the augmented reality content creation process.

305
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,340
It's a very creative process.

306
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,960
You go in with some of the current editors and you actually edit in augmented reality.

307
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,280
You position things.

308
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:25,260
It's more like directing a movie and setting up a scene than it is writing code.

309
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:30,200
And what Mozilla's position here is locking all of this down to proprietary applications

310
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,100
that only work on Windows and the Mac would be a travesty.

311
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,420
And the best use of augmented reality is going to be like in enterprises and work cases where

312
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,960
people can focus on designing the augmented information around the office space they need

313
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,540
for the tools they're working on.

314
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:47,560
And they don't have to worry about creating some sort of proprietary application to run

315
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,620
it on Windows.

316
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:53,080
They can use open web standards and pop it in a web browser and people on Android, people

317
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:59,260
on Linux, people on Windows can all view the same augmented reality objects.

318
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,740
That seems like a good idea and you want that kind of thing to be an open source tool that

319
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,780
is cross platform.

320
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,180
And I agree that people should be focused on the content, not building applications.

321
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,600
And that you need somebody to do something like this if that's ever going to take off.

322
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,180
But I'm also like you, Joe, I just don't really ever see this going anywhere.

323
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,920
If it ever does, Mozilla needs to be pre-positioned and ready to run.

324
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,300
They need to have the groundwork laid.

325
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,740
And there needs to be some sort of standard ready to be proposed so that way something

326
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,060
open is adopted instead of something that's rammed down our throats by some major corporate

327
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,060
player.

328
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,620
But I still, I really have a hard time beyond the big picture getting worked up about this

329
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:39,740
and never see myself trying this unless something really changed.

330
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,900
Well, that's the key issue here, isn't it, that if you look at the situation right now,

331
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,800
it just seems like it's just way too early for this.

332
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,620
And it just seems totally irrelevant to right now.

333
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:57,660
But if you look at the mistakes that they made with Firefox OS, the major mistake was

334
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,900
waiting too late.

335
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,740
Android and iOS had already firmly cemented their place in the market.

336
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,600
Whereas with this, they're almost too early with it.

337
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,080
And it's way better to be too early than too late, right?

338
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,920
There's a lot of different use cases for stuff like this.

339
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,860
They're trying to build a framework, a standard, all of that with this.

340
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,420
And you could see use cases like on a phone, maybe you have an app.

341
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:25,100
You hold it up over a sign, uses the camera to capture the sign, and then it uses this

342
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,680
Firefox reality browser.

343
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,060
Maybe it's just a browser embed inside an app to do the translation and display the

344
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,540
translated text.

345
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,900
And the developers didn't have to ever worry about how to display that.

346
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:38,380
They just had to worry about how to do character recognition and do translation, which is a

347
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,380
very hard problem on its own.

348
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,380
I could see it.

349
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,380
I could.

350
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,140
But I think our hardware is going to have to get a lot better.

351
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,140
Hang on.

352
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,420
We've already got Google Translate for that.

353
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,820
What do we need an open source version for?

354
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,700
Yeah, what do we need an open source version for?

355
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
Famous last words.

356
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,700
Yeah, that's not running everything through Google servers, and so they know exactly what

357
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
we're up to.

358
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,700
Yeah.

359
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,700
What would be the point of that, eh?

360
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,220
Well, you can know exactly what's going on in the news, in the open source world every

361
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,220
