00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,960
Episode 139, recorded on December 20, 2019.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,960
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,960
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,720
It's finally here.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,560
I feel like I've been waiting all year for our annual predictions episode.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,840
So this week, we own up to our past predictions, see how we did, and then, of course, make

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,960
some flawless predictions for 2020.

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,120
I'm actually pretty confident about my predictions this year.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,600
Yeah, I'm feeling kind of good, too.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:37,360
I feel like I brought my A game to these predictions, although I probably felt that way last year,

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,040
if you think about it.

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,360
Well, I certainly felt that way when I said that Microsoft would buy at least a significant

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,600
percentage share in Canonical, which has not happened.

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,960
Although I did say at the time, they're a private company, so it could happen and we

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,440
wouldn't find out about it.

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,160
But let's face it, we would have heard somehow.

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,200
But yeah, that didn't happen.

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,660
But the reason that I said it at the time was because they were starting to cozy up.

21
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:10,720
And like we talked about last week on the Review of the Year episode, they have become

22
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,340
increasingly tightly entwined.

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,320
You only have to look at the Windows subsystem for Linux stuff.

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,520
Canonical have even hired Hayden Barnes, who is really invested in WSL.

25
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,000
That partnership seems to be getting tighter.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,640
And so I thought we were going to see it.

27
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:33,600
I thought Microsoft were going to invest in Canonical and maybe even buy them outright

28
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,800
and stop this IPO from happening.

29
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,760
I saw a lot of others in the community echo a prediction like this or similar to this.

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,940
There was just a sense in the room that this could be potentially happening.

31
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,060
Maybe there were conversations, but it didn't pan out.

32
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,760
So I think we have to say good old negative on that one there, Joe.

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,720
Yeah, unfortunately, we do.

34
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:03,200
I would predict something about that again for this year.

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,680
But I didn't want to be boring.

36
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,120
So I just did an unofficial one last week.

37
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,720
I can't believe I lost my prediction.

38
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,400
I already know it didn't pan out.

39
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,020
But I predicted that Apple would launch a video streaming service that would not work

40
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,680
on Linux.

41
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,640
At the time of this prediction, it seemed like an Apple video streaming service was

42
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,360
likely a lock.

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,360
There had been no official announcements, but there had been rumors of Apple shopping

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,280
around in Hollywood and doing hires and things like that.

45
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,000
So I thought, OK, pretty good chance this is going to happen.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,980
But there's no way they'll launch it with a web service.

47
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,160
And even if they did launch it with a web service, there's no way it would work under

48
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
Linux.

49
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,800
Well, what I didn't consider was that I indeed would have to sign up to test this because

50
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,240
I haven't seen anybody report this.

51
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,120
And I figured, you can't test it because I don't even know it's available where you're

52
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
at.

53
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:10,320
So I signed up and I got logged in and on my laptop, it failed to stream.

54
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,320
It never worked.

55
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,000
And I thought, oh, man, just narrowly missed it because I hit play.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,280
The player comes up, but then nothing ever happens.

57
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,720
In fact, the whole page just becomes unresponsive.

58
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,160
And I thought, oof, just missed that one.

59
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,640
And then I got here to the studio and I thought, I better double check that on another computer.

60
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:36,880
Fired up the same exact video from the Apple TV Plus website, hit play on my Linux desktop,

61
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,240
and it started streaming immediately.

62
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,400
So you were wrong then.

63
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
It does work on Linux.

64
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,160
What are the chances?

65
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
What are the chances of that?

66
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,000
I mean, this is Apple we're talking about.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,200
Presumably, that must have been Chrome, though.

68
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,680
Yeah, it was Vivaldi.

69
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,580
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

70
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,960
It was Vivaldi on the other machine, too, though.

71
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
Same versions.

72
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,960
One was on Fedora.

73
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,960
One was on Manjaro.

74
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,400
Well, I don't think it was an unreasonable prediction because we knew that this service

75
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
was coming.

76
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,480
I don't think you can even deny that.

77
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,160
It was obvious.

78
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,520
But if you remember, it wasn't that long ago that you couldn't watch the Apple Keynotes

79
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
even.

80
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,680
If you tried to do it on Linux, it would just say, hey, you need a different browser.

81
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,640
And so I would be like, I'm not watching that then.

82
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,240
That was my logic right there.

83
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,740
That was it.

84
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,280
And there really has been no reporting about Apple Plus on Linux.

85
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,000
And if you recall, even in Linux headlines, we had reporting on Disney Plus not working

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,720
on Linux before the service even launched in the States.

87
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,160
And then it later was adjusted.

88
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,400
The DRM was notched down or up, however that system works.

89
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,240
And now Linux playback with Disney Plus is possible.

90
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,960
And that was also reported on.

91
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,560
But in the meantime, nothing about Apple Plus.

92
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,000
I figured that meant, oh, good, it's not working.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It must not be working.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Otherwise, people would be saying, hey, look at this, it works.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,580
But it was slow.

96
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,620
The experience wasn't very good.

97
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,620
But it did stream.

98
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,360
I suppose it's probably a case of the kind of people who would want to get it working

99
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,200
on Linux wouldn't shout about it because they might be a bit embarrassed about paying Apple

100
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
maybe.

101
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,920
Yeah, I guess that could be true.

102
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
I don't know.

103
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,680
I kind of like that morning show with that Jennifer Aniston.

104
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,760
Yeah, I hear good things about it, but I'm not signing up to Apple, so there's enough

105
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
other content.

106
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,760
Yeah.

107
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,480
Yeah, I actually think the way it worked out is I got it for free with a device.

108
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,280
So it was sort of perfect.

109
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,200
But I think the way I did it is I get it for a year, and then in a year, they're going

110
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,840
to start dinging me for the price if I forget to cancel it.

111
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,800
Which you obviously will do.

112
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,320
Of course I will.

113
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,080
Your next prediction, pie in the sky.

114
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,640
I would have loved to have seen this work out.

115
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,400
Yeah, Steam Linux market share will crack 5%.

116
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,000
It barely cracked 1%, so that was a massive fail.

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:08,200
My reasoning was that the Epic store was going to take away enough of the Windows Steam market

118
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:15,440
share to kind of by default raise the Linux market share, as well as Proton and everything

119
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,000
raising it a little bit.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And it was pie in the sky.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,600
I said 5% to be a real dreamer.

122
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,600
I was thinking at least two or three, though.

123
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,200
But to have remained stagnant at around about 1%, it's not great.

124
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,620
Although it depends which way you look at it, right?

125
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,320
Because the overall number of Steam users has gone up massively.

126
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,360
And therefore the Linux users have gone up, but just not proportionally with the other

127
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
platforms.

128
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,460
I guess I can see the logic.

129
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:50,440
If you were thinking the Epic store, amongst other things, would take users away from Steam,

130
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:57,920
so the Windows user percentage would drop, and you combine Proton, I could see how that

131
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,440
could have led to a boost, but it just didn't quite materialize.

132
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,320
By all accounts, it remains to be a pretty small market share.

133
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
A good one, though.

134
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,000
I mean, I'm thrilled, but still pretty small.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,640
Yeah, I'm not going to make any predictions about that this year, because I just don't

136
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,160
think it's going to change much, really.

137
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,120
Well, I think I have made a prediction there.

138
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:27,720
Okay, so my next one, maybe you could give it to me on a technicality, but I think I

139
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
overshot.

140
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,560
Office, as an Electron app, comes to Linux, likely just as a beta, or something available

141
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,840
at Office 365 subs, but in a limited way is what I was thinking.

142
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,060
Well, I think that we have to call this a win, because there's two ways you could possibly

143
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,880
be half right, and two halves make a whole, right?

144
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:54,920
So the first one is that we saw Teams come to Linux as an Electron app, and that is part

145
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
of Office.

146
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Right.

147
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:03,200
In fact, it was introduced as the first Office 365 app coming to Linux by Microsoft.

148
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Yeah.

149
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,840
So I think even just that would qualify as a half point, and probably a win.

150
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,800
But Hayden Barnes, who I mentioned, he has made an unofficial web app, Office Snap, which

151
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,200
is just a web wrapper around Office 365, and isn't that what an Electron app essentially

152
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
is?

153
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,240
Kind of.

154
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,600
So it's another half point, so two halves make a whole?

155
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Yeah.

156
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,960
So I'm calling that a win, then.

157
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
All right, I'll take it.

158
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,960
I'll definitely take it.

159
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,080
I think we'll probably see a lot more in 2020, but that's not an actual prediction, except

160
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,680
for I think I just made it a prediction.

161
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,360
You keep accidentally predicting things.

162
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,880
I guess that means we should probably get into our 2020 predictions.

163
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,520
Do you feel like going first?

164
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
All right.

165
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:54,560
So I think that in 2020, you'll be able to buy a RISC-V based single board computer that's

166
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,840
capable of running a full Linux desktop, even if it's just XFCE or something like that with

167
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,200
Debian, and it will cost no more than the most expensive Raspberry Pi.

168
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Okay.

169
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,320
So are you talking like a small board with some IO on it that sort of looks familiar

170
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,040
as a Raspberry Pi, or is this a full product?

171
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Is this in a case?

172
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Oh, no.

173
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,840
I think we're talking something that looks very much like a Raspberry Pi that will probably

174
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:25,160
have GPIO, and it'll have some sort of video out, whether that is HDMI or DisplayPort,

175
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,160
something like that.

176
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,580
It'll have USB ports, and you'll be able to run a full Linux desktop on it.

177
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,760
I'm not saying that it's going to perform as well as a Raspberry Pi, but I think it'll

178
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,000
be in and around about that price range of whatever the most expensive Raspberry Pi is

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,160
at the time, which is this is kind of a double prediction that we may see a more expensive

180
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,120
Raspberry Pi possibly with eight gigs of RAM or something like that, but it's going to

181
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,800
be in that price range, in that affordable price range.

182
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,200
It'll probably perform much more like a Raspberry Pi Zero, and it'll be very expensive for the

183
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,520
performance that you'll get out of it, but I think that you will be able to run a full

184
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,580
Linux desktop on a RISC-V board.

185
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,520
That was going to be my next question is what you thought the performance would be like.

186
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,560
I could see this.

187
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,880
This is a little pie in the sky, but it's pie in the sky in a Joe way that I like.

188
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,720
You've been rooting for something like this for a long time, so it'd be nice to see this

189
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,400
really kind of come to fruition, and you're setting expectations pretty low with the Raspberry

190
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:30,800
Pi Zero performance benchmark, so I mean, this really would be the next step to get

191
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,480
application development for the RISC-V chip into gear.

192
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,840
I think they should do this.

193
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Somebody should.

194
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,040
Well, I think there is definitely a market for it.

195
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,880
I don't know how big that market is, but I know that all of us would buy one if it's

196
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,720
only the price of a Raspberry Pi 4.

197
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,880
Yeah, I'd totally just check it out.

198
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,360
Plus, you know future versions are going to get faster.

199
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
Yeah, exactly.

200
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,560
I also have a bit of a soft spot for RISC.

201
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
All right.

202
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,560
Well, that's a good one.

203
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,560
So we shall see.

204
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,160
Do you have a guess towards the end of 2020?

205
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,200
Am I going to have this thing in the summer in my hands, or what do you think?

206
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,760
I'm thinking it's going to be cold by the time you get this.

207
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,760
All right.

208
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
All right.

209
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Well, you know what?

210
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
Give me something to do in the crappy weather.

211
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,760
All right.

212
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, your old barber, Richard Stallman, is going to reemerge on the talk scene in 2020.

213
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,560
He'll be in the talk circuit, not necessarily affiliated with any particular group.

214
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,660
Now he's more like a mercenary for free software, going anywhere that will have him and speaking

215
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,320
the good word of our freedoms.

216
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,080
I don't think this is hugely unreasonable or unlikely, because he was doing a lot of

217
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,880
traveling and talking before as part of his role at the FSF.

218
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,880
And you kind of start to miss that, I would imagine, after a while.

219
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,960
So you'll want to get back out there.

220
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,560
And I know there's plenty of places that still would hear him talk.

221
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,900
I mean, there are some that would be not interested at all.

222
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,680
And there may be a bit of controversy if he goes anywhere.

223
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,260
But I think people will book him.

224
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,480
So yeah, I think this is pretty likely.

225
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:09,520
Yeah, that's really the unknown is, are there places, talks, events, whatever, gatherings

226
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:15,400
that are willing to A, pay whatever it would be to get him out there, and B, take the political

227
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
risk of it?

228
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,320
I wager yes.

229
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,440
The reason why I put this down here is I don't think we've had a complete conversation around

230
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,520
Richard Stallman and what happens next.

231
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,960
I mean, maybe we just expect him all to retire and just quietly go away.

232
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,360
But I don't see a man who's been living his entire life preaching one thing just all of

233
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
a sudden stopping.

234
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,760
It seems like he might wait for things to cool down, and then for friendly invites to

235
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,000
come his way.

236
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's my prediction.

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,720
Sometime in 2020, we'll see him reemerge on the talk scene.

238
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,120
I think we may well see him get booked and then subsequently no platformed at some places.

239
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,440
And I think that we might well see some controversy about that.

240
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,880
And it'll just reignite the whole thing.

241
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,600
So yeah, I think it would be better if he did just retire.

242
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,880
But you're right, he's not going to.

243
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,480
Now we teased an AWS prediction last episode.

244
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,760
So what do you got for us?

245
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,560
Okay, by this time next year, there'll be a license that solves the AWS problem while

246
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,640
still being open source.

247
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,320
Now, if I knew the details of this, then I would be a much cleverer person.

248
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,920
But I have faith that there is someone out there in the open source community that will

249
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,840
find a solution to this problem.

250
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:35,200
There will be a way to craft a license that is still open source and still meets the definition,

251
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,880
but somehow stops the likes of Amazon and the other cloud providers from taking open

252
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:45,400
source software and commercializing it and making money from it.

253
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,080
I have no idea how that is possible, but it must be.

254
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,880
And there must be someone in this community who's got the brains to do it.

255
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,640
So you think it'll come from the community?

256
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
Yes.

257
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,280
I've been wondering if it won't come from AWS as a bit of a reaction to the backlash.

258
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,800
They'll sit down and go, man, you know, we've got time and money.

259
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,740
What we ought to do here is come up with a statement of how we contribute back.

260
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:15,240
And we have a commitment of contribution to any projects that we utilize in the AWS infrastructure

261
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,720
that we monetize.

262
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,080
We have a commitment, like a code of giving back that we commit ourselves to for these

263
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,080
projects.

264
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,860
And maybe it's financially, maybe it's code, whatever it is, I think that solves it too.

265
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:31,480
But it only solves it for one provider, I suppose, where something that's a license

266
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,000
from within the community would solve it potentially across all cloud providers.

267
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,320
It could do.

268
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,800
Maybe one solution would be for AWS to add an option, like an optional fraction of a

269
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,880
cent per hour or whatever, if you're using certain software, and then leave it up to

270
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
the customers.

271
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,600
Do they want to contribute?

272
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,480
Or just set aside a tiny percentage per hour that gets used, and then just funnel that

273
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,800
to the various open source projects.

274
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Hmm.

275
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,040
The more we talk about this, Joe, the less likely it sounds.

276
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,980
That sounds like you're adding additional costs to run cloud infrastructure and cutting

277
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,080
costs is the name of the game there.

278
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,280
Yeah, exactly.

279
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
This is a tricky problem.

280
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:17,840
And it's one that we've really seen up close and personal in 2019.

281
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,840
I'm going to be watching to see if somebody solves this.

282
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,840
I hope you're right.

283
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,560
I hope we see a license that solves the quote unquote AWS problem.

284
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,680
And if it does, that's how they'll be talking about it too.

285
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,800
I don't have any clue how though.

286
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,320
It seems like an unstoppable force meets an immovable object to me.

287
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
Mm-hmm.

288
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
It's fire meets fuel.

289
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
Yeah.

290
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,000
There just has to be a solution to this.

291
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Okay.

292
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You ready for mine?

293
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,920
Now this one, it's sort of like my Apple TV prediction.

294
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,780
There's rumors bubbling, but we don't have any commitments.

295
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:51,720
We don't have any clarifications, but I'm getting the sense that Nvidia in 2020 via

296
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:58,800
various types of support, be it code, documentation, developer time, et cetera, enables the Nuvoo

297
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,400
driver to be fully functional for the majority of use cases with a few exceptions.

298
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,160
I'm afraid I've never heard of that driver.

299
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,640
Do you mean that Nuvo driver?

300
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,640
Oh yeah.

301
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,640
You know the Nuvo.

302
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
All right.

303
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,640
You finally got it right.

304
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,640
Yeah.

305
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,640
Yeah.

306
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
Yeah.

307
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
I think this could happen.

308
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,240
I think they could look at what's happening with the AMD driver and they could say for

309
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,960
the workstation case and for the gamer types, we're going to make this work.

310
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,640
Now if you're going to do some sort of fancy XYZ workstation card or do some sort of high-end

311
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,720
thing, you're going to need our special driver still.

312
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,580
But for basic just install a vanilla distro and the Nvidia support is baked into the kernel

313
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:43,520
and you can launch a game and you can play a Vulkan game.

314
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,380
I think that's going to work in 2020.

315
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,440
It might not be shipping in distros.

316
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,200
You know, I don't know how far the code will be, but I think that's where we're going in

317
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
2020.

318
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,120
So you're talking about proper 3D acceleration and stuff, not just standard 2D stuff, which

319
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,960
is there already on my desktop.

320
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,320
That's kind of my media machine that's got a really, really low end Nvidia card in it.

321
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:08,560
And that works perfectly without the binary driver, but I don't play any games on it.

322
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,240
So you're saying that you will actually be able to play games here?

323
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,680
Yeah, at least Vulkan games.

324
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:18,280
Yeah, I think it's going to work just like with my AMD 580 I have upstairs.

325
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,720
Just put that sucker in the old PCI slot, boot her up.

326
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,960
The drivers baked right in.

327
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,880
I launched Steam, start a game and I never had to install a single binary.

328
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,080
Never had to do a dang thing.

329
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,400
That'll be the experience ultimately with where Nvidia is going.

330
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,280
Don't know if we're going to get to that point in 2020, but all of the groundwork, the code,

331
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,980
the effort, all of that will start perhaps arch users or people that are on the edge

332
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,200
and can maybe even build it and take advantage of it.

333
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,080
But what about the machine learning stuff?

334
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,840
You don't think that's going to be included?

335
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,840
I don't know.

336
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,160
I think there will be limits.

337
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,920
I think there will be limits.

338
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:56,520
Not sure where that line's at, mostly because I don't totally appreciate the difference

339
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,540
between all the functional differences between Nvidia's ridiculously expensive enterprise

340
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,640
cards and their consumer grade cards.

341
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,320
But I definitely think there could be a line there, for example.

342
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,400
And what other exceptions are we talking about then?

343
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,400
I'm not sure.

344
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,040
And the reason is, is I would not be surprised if this isn't even fully shipping to end users

345
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,400
by the end of 2020.

346
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,160
Something like this could take a long time.

347
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,920
It really sort of depends on the state of that nouveau driver.

348
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,820
Well, again, I think you're probably right.

349
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,860
You've put enough caveats in this to get away with pretty much anything really, as long

350
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,560
as you can play some sort of games with the nouveau driver.

351
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,560
What about frame rates then?

352
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,760
Are we talking comparable frame rates?

353
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,240
Are we still talking that with the binary driver, it is going to be significantly better

354
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,240
in terms of performance?

355
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,920
Yeah, I think at binary equal performance, yeah.

356
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,500
I'm thinking it's right there.

357
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,320
It's binary equivalent.

358
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,040
It's like all the stuff you need for a consumer grade, or even an enterprise workstation where

359
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:59,000
you need some 3D acceleration, but maybe you're not doing CUDA stuff, or you're not doing

360
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,520
machine learning stuff, or whatever those cards do, you know, the magic stuff where

361
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,000
they open up a vortex inside the card and calculate things that only enterprise cards

362
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
can calculate?

363
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yeah.

364
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That won't work.

365
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah.

366
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeah, I don't know.

367
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,420
I'm kind of spitballing on this one, Joe, but I'm just reading the tea leaves, and I'm

368
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,560
thinking from a competitive standpoint, AMD is kicking their ass right now in the Linux

369
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,160
workstation space.

370
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,180
And Nvidia, they're one of those companies that keeps an eye on what the competition

371
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,180
is doing.

372
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,320
But it's been such a good year for AMD.

373
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,240
If you look at the Ryzen stuff, the Threadripper, and the Epic, and of course with the graphics

374
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,680
cards just working out of the box with the kernel.

375
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,800
So maybe we will see Nvidia start to think, hmm, we need a bit of that market.

376
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,840
Yeah, I don't think they're feeling the heat like Intel is, but I bet they're feeling the

377
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
heat a little bit.

378
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,920
Well, I look forward to returning to these predictions next year, but not as much as

379
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:56,080
I look forward to returning to Bitcoin prices where we always get it wrong.

380
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,640
We have to do this.

381
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
Sorry.

382
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,640
We have to now.

383
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,920
I hate this, but it's necessary, it's like the vegetables of the predictions episode.

384
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,360
So how do we do last year?

385
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,060
Okay, so we always do this, the high for the year, the low for the year, and the price

386
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,200
on December 1st, all in US dollars.

387
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:22,240
So I said that the high for 2019 would be $6,000, and you said it would be $12,000.

388
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,880
It was actually $13,000 in June.

389
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Hmm.

390
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,280
Did a little better than you expected there, Joe.

391
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,560
In fact, it did a little better than I expected.

392
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,360
Yeah, but by price is right rules, you still win.

393
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:39,280
Yeah, so that's $13,000 was in June.

394
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,720
So that's a little bit now.

395
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,160
So it peaked around summertime.

396
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
Let's talk about the lows.

397
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,000
I predicted $900, and you predicted $300.

398
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,760
So we thought it was really going to bottom out, but it actually only got down to $3,400,

399
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,000
which is pretty low, but actually not too bad.

400
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Not as bad as we thought.

401
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,680
It could have gotten a lot worse, it looks like.

402
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,840
Well, yeah, it could have got a lot worse.

403
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:12,880
It was relatively stable, kind of hanging around at about $4,000-ish for the first few

404
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:21,740
months and then creeping up to that $14,000, and then creeping back down to about $7,400

405
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:28,240
on the 1st of December, which you had said it would be $9,200, and I said it would be

406
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,040
$2,000.

407
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:35,880
So you're much closer, but price is right rules means that I win that one, I'm afraid.

408
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,560
Yeah, fair enough, fair enough.

409
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:45,720
You know, I look at these numbers, and I think $7,000, not quite what I expected.

410
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,160
You seem to be satisfied with $7,000 as the year wraps up.

411
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,280
I, on the other hand, not satisfied.

412
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:59,760
I think if you look at Bitcoin, there's one factor that I always try to remember is at

413
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:09,200
a certain point in the lifespan, which isn't that far away, it stops minting new coins.

414
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:15,200
And then there will only be a set amount of Bitcoins in circulation ever.

415
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,520
And people are losing these things like crazy, throwing away hard drives, forgetting passwords,

416
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,760
getting them stolen by Russian hackers, it still stings.

417
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,720
I try to factor that in a little bit into my prediction, keeping in mind that the longer

418
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,520
Bitcoin stays alive, inherently the more valuable each coin becomes because there is a fixed

419
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
amount.

420
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,680
Well, it depends which way you look at it, because more and more keep being created,

421
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,280
and therefore you'd expect the price to go down until we get to the point where that

422
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:49,240
finite number have been created, there will be no more, and then you'd expect it to rise

423
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,480
at least gradually.

424
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
Yeah.

425
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,800
Although, because people know, people know that's coming, they start to factor that into

426
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,680
the cost ahead of time, I think.

427
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:03,400
It's not in our lifetime, but it is within a conceivable amount of time.

428
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,240
It's something like 21 million or something like that, if I recall.

429
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,680
So when it's at $7,000, I'm like, oh, you know, okay, you could do better.

430
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:18,080
But by some measures, some consider it one of the best investments of the decade.

431
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,080
Yeah.

432
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,640
If you'd invested just $1 in Bitcoin at the beginning of the decade, it'd be worth around

433
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,920
90,000 now.

434
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:31,800
So if you put a couple thousand dollars in, I'm not even going to do that math, it's too

435
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
depressing.

436
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
I know.

437
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
It is way too depressing.

438
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,120
It's way, way too depressing.

439
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,620
But it's one of the best performing investments of the decade.

440
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,200
That's from CNN Business, which is wild.

441
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,320
It sounds like it's something that some crazy person on the internet is saying, but they're

442
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,360
not the only one writing that either.

443
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,280
So with that said, looking forward to 2020, expectations are kind of high, I think.

444
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,280
I don't know.

445
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,440
My expectations aren't that high.

446
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,640
I want to see stability, because stability will ultimately mean a greater value.

447
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:10,240
It'd be far better if it stabilized at a price and gradually, gradually, gradually ticked

448
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,360
up and up and up.

449
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,040
The fact that we see a graph that looks like a sine wave, it's not a good look.

450
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,600
Now that's kind of true.

451
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,020
However, if you look at that graph on a much wider zoom, you'll notice that when it does

452
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:32,520
crash down, it generally doesn't go below the value before the rally started.

453
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,160
So when Bitcoin goes through a rally, and then there's an eventual correction and the

454
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:42,200
price comes way down, when it finally settles, it settles at a price higher than when the

455
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,420
rally begun.

456
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,520
So when you look at it from that perspective, and you consider that over a many, many, many,

457
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,600
many year perspective, overall, it ends up higher.

458
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,940
It's just in the meantime, it goes up and down quite a bit.

459
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,400
But yeah, I know it still is all over the place.

460
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,920
But I'm feeling good about it.

461
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,920
I'm feeling good.

462
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,360
People are going to be all jacked up about an election.

463
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,680
Whenever the state of the US government comes into question, the price of Bitcoin always

464
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,680
goes up.

465
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,440
So I'm feeling good about 2020.

466
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Okay.

467
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,060
So what's your high prediction then for 2020?

468
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:25,040
My max high for 2020 is a price that Bitcoin hasn't seen in two years.

469
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:27,800
And that is $22,000.

470
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,440
Well it's never seen 22 has it?

471
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
No.

472
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
It got up to just about 20.

473
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,080
So you think it's going to have an all time high this year?

474
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,080
I do.

475
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,080
Interesting.

476
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,840
I was thinking about this while I was driving earlier, because I still just couldn't make

477
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
my mind up.

478
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,400
And I thought, right, it's going to get to a high of 19.

479
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,960
And then it's not going to keep going because people are going to get too nervous.

480
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,840
They're going to think, is it going to get to 20?

481
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,840
Is it going to break that?

482
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
And then it just won't.

483
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,220
I think around about 19,000.

484
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,680
And then it'll start to come back down again.

485
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
19,000.

486
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,200
That's higher than I was expecting.

487
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,800
I'd like it to not get that high.

488
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,680
I'd like it to be more stable, but I don't think we're going to see that.

489
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,880
I think that we will see a bit of a run on it.

490
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,680
I'm not sure at what point in the year, possibly around the election, I don't know.

491
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:18,400
It depends who ends up being selected as the Democratic nomination.

492
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,280
I think that could have a strong impact on it.

493
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:27,680
So the 2020 low I think is the hardest thing to pin down for this prediction, because I

494
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,960
think we are about to see the low when we go into January in the beginning of the year.

495
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,240
I think we will be seeing the low point for Bitcoin in the year.

496
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,080
So I didn't know what to say here because it's all over the place.

497
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,020
It's staying somewhere in the seven thousand dollar price range.

498
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,180
This morning before we recorded it almost broke sixty nine hundred.

499
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:52,060
But as we record now, it's at seventy one hundred.

500
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,060
So I have to factor in another disaster could happen.

501
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,060
It's possible.

502
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,720
And January is well, it's here.

503
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,600
So you never know.

504
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,280
I genuinely don't think it's going to go this low, but I want to give myself some some ceiling

505
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,840
or some floor, I guess, in this case.

506
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,320
So I'm going to say Bitcoin's 2020 low will be five thousand dollars.

507
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,640
That's interesting because I think it's going to be four thousand.

508
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,640
Really?

509
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,400
Yeah, I think it's not going to go any lower than that.

510
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,980
But I think it will break through the five into the fours and then settle around about

511
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,760
four thousand and then creep back up again.

512
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,880
Little news could cause market turmoil, which could cause the price to go up.

513
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,600
Plus, there's more and more outlets right now doing these stories about Bitcoin being

514
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,080
the best investment of the last decade.

515
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,880
And that could also cause people to spend money.

516
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
True.

517
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,240
See, I think we're going into the low period right now.

518
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,240
So it may not go lower than seven in 2020.

519
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,360
But I'm putting five.

520
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,360
You're putting four down.

521
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
I'm going to say four.

522
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,360
All right.

523
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,360
All right.

524
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,240
It is worth mentioning at this point that we're recording on the 20th of December, even

525
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,440
though we're talking about this year when you're listening to this.

526
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,560
So we may well be wrong already.

527
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,960
I know that's so actually likely to be the case.

528
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
It's ridiculous.

529
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,720
Now, our price that we both think it will be on December 1st, 2020.

530
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,080
This is like the health check.

531
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,440
Does it come up from its lows?

532
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,440
Does it stay low?

533
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,520
Does it does it remain at its peaks, which I said it's going to be twenty two thousand

534
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,520
dollars?

535
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,560
I'm putting down for the price on December 1st, 2020, Bitcoin will be around fourteen

536
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,800
thousand dollars.

537
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,660
I'm going to say almost half that seven thousand four hundred.

538
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,720
That's a very specific price because that's how much it was this year.

539
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,880
I think that we're going to see stability in the long term.

540
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,640
It'll go up, it'll go down, but eventually it will find its way back to seven thousand

541
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,760
four hundred.

542
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,120
That would be like the first year, though, that there wasn't a pretty significant value

543
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
increase.

544
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,680
So you're kind of taking a risk with that one.

545
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,720
Yes, I'm taking a risk because it's what I want to happen, I think.

546
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,440
Because how can you possibly predict Bitcoin?

547
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,160
You've just got to do what you, you've either got to be crazy with it or say what you actually

548
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,160
want to happen.

549
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,160
That's true.

550
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,580
Yeah, I'd love it to be worth a million because then I'd be rich with my tiny amount, less

551
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,580
than one.

552
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,080
But it's not going to happen that, is it?

553
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,080
What should be wrong?

554
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
And it will be worth a million.

555
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
You never know.

556
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,960
I suppose something could happen.

557
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,240
Wouldn't it just take some nation or some massive institution saying we're switching

558
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,480
to Bitcoin as our backing and then takes off like crazy?

559
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,680
There'd be a pretty foolish nation doing that.

560
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,680
I know.

561
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,520
Yeah, I don't think so.

562
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,800
And the thing is with crypto currencies is if you're going to do something like that,

563
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,160
you just make your own.

564
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,320
Yeah, true.

565
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:42,120
You could see potentially like a huge crash in the dollar or something, which seems very

566
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,760
unlikely.

567
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,160
And if the dollar is worth much less than it is now, then by default Bitcoin will be

568
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
worth more.

569
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,760
But I think that's pie in the sky.

570
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:59,480
Well history has taught us that if there's one thing more volatile than the Linux open

571
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,700
source community, it is the Bitcoin community.

572
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,040
So it's going to be all over the place.

573
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,480
The community is all over the place.

574
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,560
There'll be all kinds of different crypto developments.

575
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,480
So it's really tough to nail it down.

576
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,280
But I feel like this time next year, Bitcoin will still be the king cryptocurrency.

577
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,400
No, my couple hundred dogecoin are going to be worth a fortune.

578
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
No, it's Libra.

579
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,840
It's going to be Facebook's Libra.

580
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,600
Well it's back to our regularly scheduled program, back to reporting on the news and
