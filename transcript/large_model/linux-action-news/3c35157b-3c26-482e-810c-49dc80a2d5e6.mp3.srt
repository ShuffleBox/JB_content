00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,640
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,400
This is episode 86, recorded on December 21st, 2018. I'm Chris.

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,400
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,720
Hello, Joe. It is finally here. Our annual predictions and, for the first time ever,

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,480
look back at our former predictions, which I think we should just skip right over and

6
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,320
not even talk about at all.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,360
Well, I've left the Bitcoin stuff till the end. So, yeah.

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,320
Okay. All right. Well, then I think I can get through some of this. Maybe we should

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,680
start with your first quote unquote prediction, which I don't think really came true.

10
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:56,560
No, and listening back to this today, we were both dead certain that this was going to happen.

11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:03,760
And this was that Ubuntu Unity 7 would become an official flavor. And we just thought, oh,

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,560
that's a dead cert. That's just a really easy one. But that hasn't really happened, has

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,440
it? We've seen a few images. We've seen some work towards it. But there just doesn't seem

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:19,160
to be enough momentum there to get even a project going properly, never mind an official

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:25,780
flavor. And we both agreed that by 1810, it would be. But apparently, people are happy

16
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,780
enough with GNOME.

17
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,560
Yeah, I actually thought you were cheating a little bit with this one. That was such

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,000
a gimme. Of course that's going to happen. I think in part because we were hearing from

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,760
canonical employees that were trying to make that a thing. So it seemed natural that that

20
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,760
would pan out. But I think the other thing that happened was they nailed the GNOME implementation.

21
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:54,000
It's good. And by 1810, it's really good. And 1904, by all accounts, is looking really

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,880
neat. So I think that was part of that whole Unity 7 will survive was some incorrect assumption

23
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,000
that the GNOME Shell implementation would be trash. Just didn't pan out. And so the

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,560
need just wasn't really there.

25
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah. And of course, in Marte, you can make a fairly good approximation of Unity 7. And

26
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,080
you can do it in Plasma as well. So if people were really wedded to that workflow, there

27
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,040
are ways to get more or less that workflow with other desktops. And maybe people were

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,960
just willing to do that. Or much more likely, as you say, just the GNOME implementation

29
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,960
in Ubuntu was good enough.

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:42,520
I missed the mark, though, on my prediction. I thought we'd have a massive botnet story.

31
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:51,680
Just a cyber attack type story that was facilitated by a bunch of insecure Linux-powered, unfortunately,

32
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:59,200
IoT devices. I thought it would at least be the largest area of attacks over 2018, mostly

33
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,080
due to bad defaults. And in some ways, that did pan out. We saw routers really get abused

34
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:11,160
this year. But the smart plugs, the toasters, we haven't really had that doomsday story

35
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,080
that I thought we would have. So I'm going to mark that one as a miss.

36
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,280
Well, you did also say Linux servers. And you were kind of half right in that we've

37
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,200
had a lot of crypto miner attacks on Linux servers. So you were kind of almost right.

38
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,760
But I think that's a bit of a stretch. So yeah, I think we're kind of both a bust on

39
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,760
those two there.

40
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,360
Well, OK. All right. How about your next one? I think you had a Microsoft prediction, I

41
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,360
recall.

42
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Yeah, I said that Microsoft Linux, maybe called Azure Linux, would come out. And it would

43
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:51,720
be their own cloud distro with tight windows, desktop integration, and basically that Microsoft

44
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,120
would have a Linux distro. And I think I was more or less right. I wasn't quite right in

45
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,360
the details. But they did put out a Linux distro, didn't they?

46
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:07,340
Yeah. I mean, Azure Sphere OS is Linux-powered. And it's a cloud-connected Linux OS running

47
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:13,480
on devices being sold by Microsoft this year. I mean, I think that counts, Joe. I think

48
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,880
you get a win on that one. It's a close call, because I don't think it was exactly what

49
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,360
you had in mind. But I think you win on a technicality.

50
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,480
I think it was a bit more than a technicality. But either way, yeah, I'm claiming that as

51
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
a win.

52
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:33,640
I'm happy to report that my next one was also mostly a miss. In some ways, what I was watching

53
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:40,480
was a storm a-brewing. Winter was coming to the open source community, and I didn't expect

54
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:47,340
the best from us. But I think overall, mostly things turned out okay. I thought we'd see

55
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:53,300
a huge gap between the idealist and the pragmatist. And I thought we'd see that really widen as

56
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:59,820
you had people that were in that DevOps category or sysadmin category or web dev or whoever

57
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,280
it is that is buying Sputnik laptops and buying these different machines and installing Linux

58
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:11,080
on them and replicating production and development on their laptops. That stereotypical person

59
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,080
now that's driving the adoption of Linux.

60
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,320
My big fear was that there would become sort of a battle between those that were involved

61
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,960
in Linux for the freedom aspects and those that were involved in Linux for the work aspects.

62
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,620
And I thought as the people that were just using it as a work tool grew, that gap would

63
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,600
become more and more polarized. And that really didn't seem to happen. We do definitely see

64
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,720
more and more pragmatists using Linux as just a day to day work tool. And we see more and

65
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,180
more different implementations of Linux across commercial operating systems like Windows

66
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,840
and Chrome. But thankfully, there hasn't been that big community battle playing out in all

67
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,620
of the different aspects of online communication. Yeah, it's there. It's always been there.

68
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:01,040
But it didn't turn into the all full fledged holy war that I was expecting.

69
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:08,960
I think the reason for that is that all the pragmatic stuff is additions to Linux. If

70
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,680
you look at, for example, the Nvidia driver, you don't have to install that. I have got

71
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:23,480
a PC that's running the Nuvo driver, for example, and I don't need to do any 3D stuff with it.

72
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,300
And the card works perfectly well with Nuvo. And so it's running almost all free software.

73
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,680
And so those pragmatists who have definitely grown in number, we've seen that this year,

74
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,360
definitely, we've seen a big rise in that pragmatism. Take Fedora, for example, making

75
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,200
it easy to install those proprietary drivers. And we've seen more and more people coming

76
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,480
to Linux using it for things like gaming with Steam.

77
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:54,640
Sure. I would argue the accelerated use of snaps, flat packs, and app images is also

78
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,440
a bit of the pragmatists taking over.

79
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,860
Yeah, definitely. And so you were kind of half right there. We have definitely seen

80
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:05,480
more pragmatism and more pragmatists coming to the Linux world. But I think the people

81
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,260
who are running Triskill or Debian with no proprietary stuff, they don't really care

82
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,840
because that stuff still exists for them. And they just don't have these proprietary

83
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,000
additions on top of it.

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,200
Yeah, fair enough. Their territory didn't go away. It's just, like you said, all been

85
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,200
in addition. We've just made room for everybody.

86
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:30,240
Yeah, I think that it's ultimately better. I think that the free stuff does benefit from

87
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,800
the pragmatists coming along because it's no good having the NVIDIA driver be really,

88
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,200
really great if the rest of Wayland and whatever doesn't work very well. And so that kind of

89
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,760
feeds into the free software development, makes that better, and then the purists and

90
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:52,400
the free software people benefit as a result. So maybe that's also why there's not been

91
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
this big backlash.

92
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,480
Well, before we own up on the Bitcoin stuff, do you want to lay down a few 2019 predictions?

93
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,240
Okay, my first one. Now, you have to bear in mind that people have been saying this

94
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,240
for many years now. And I've been saying, no, it's not going to happen. And it hasn't

95
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,480
happened so far. But I'm convinced that this year it will happen. And that is that Microsoft

96
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:22,160
will buy at least a significant percentage share in Canonical. It just seems inevitable

97
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:29,120
to me that I don't think they will kind of buy them out right. And we might not even

98
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,400
hear about it because it is a private company. But I think they'd struggle to keep it quiet.

99
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,120
And Shotworth said he was looking for investors before the IPO. And so I think that Microsoft

100
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,000
is going to pony up and put some money into Canonical this year, a significant amount

101
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
of money.

102
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,840
So if you've been saying this isn't going to happen for years now, what is it about

103
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,840
now that's changed your mind? Is it the IBM Red Hat sale?

104
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:59,160
I think that has definitely played into it. And of course, SUSE was acquired this year.

105
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,320
Yeah, and last year and the year before.

106
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,440
Yeah, yeah. But it goes to show there is a market for these companies. And I think really

107
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:12,680
what has changed my mind here is that Shotworth has cleaned house over the last sort of 18

108
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:21,560
months and made Ubuntu and Canonical a profitable, leaner operation that is growing and making

109
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,360
some money and innovating. And is actually quite an attractive proposition now for someone

110
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:32,640
to buy. Whereas before, they had the phone stuff that was going nowhere in Unity 8. Whereas

111
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,440
now it's much more streamlined. And it just seems much more valuable.

112
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,300
Yeah. And with the Red Hat acquisition from IBM, there is less opportunity for Microsoft.

113
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,400
And so they need to strike while there's still opportunity. And we know that this year, Azure

114
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:55,400
crossed the 60% line for Linux. That's a massive number for Microsoft. And they seem to be

115
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:01,360
willing to do whatever it takes to keep more people getting into Azure. I got to imagine

116
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,920
they're looking at this at least. Maybe it won't happen. But I think it's a pretty solid

117
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,880
prediction. And I like the hedge that you've made this year. And that is, it's at least

118
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:16,320
a percentage. Because you're going to be right if they just invest. And you're going to be

119
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,640
right if they buy them. So that's a safe one.

120
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,320
Well, I'd say it's a significant percentage. I'm not talking 5%. I'm talking at least 20,

121
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
25.

122
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,880
Well, I've got one that I feel like is going to be a pain point for Linux users this year,

123
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,040
especially for those in the iOS ecosystem that have an iPhone or an iPad and have a

124
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:42,160
Linux box. I'm pretty positive that Apple will indeed launch a video streaming service.

125
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,560
Original content, much like Netflix does, that's not going to work with Linux at all.

126
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,960
And Linux users will be completely left out as if it was 1997 all over again. And the

127
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,460
richest company, or at least the richest tech company in the world, continues to underdeliver

128
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,920
for us Linux users.

129
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,400
You have got some front, my friend, to say this. This is so obviously going to happen

130
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,620
that I couldn't possibly have put it in. Apple are definitely going to launch a video streaming

131
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,620
service.

132
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,020
No, I think people listening to this show will be like, what? A Netflix competing streaming

133
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,940
service? These guys are crazy. I don't think it's a foregone conclusion. Not until Uncle

134
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,340
Tim's up on stage, Joe.

135
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,760
Come on. We've read how many stories this year that they're working on it and how they're

136
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:30,840
not going to have any swearing or nudity and it's going to struggle to compete.

137
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,840
It's already struggling to compete before it's launched. I love it.

138
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:40,560
Yeah, yeah. And the idea that this would possibly be available on Linux, well, OK, maybe via

139
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,340
the browser. But you would imagine, I mean, you can't even watch the Apple launches on

140
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:51,560
Linux, can you, in the browser? So yeah, I wouldn't be surprised at all. This, to me,

141
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,440
is the easiest, definite prediction that I've ever heard.

142
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,040
Easier than yours, huh? Hmm.

143
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,260
Well, the Microsoft buying canonical, that could definitely not. I mean, Shuttleworth

144
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:08,400
has said that he's looking to IPO. The official line is that they're not selling. And so no

145
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,840
way. This is definitely happening.

146
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,840
I wouldn't completely count Apple out. See, if you look at the divisions of Apple, they

147
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:23,560
have Apple Music for Android. They just launched Apple Music for Alexa. Cancel. Cancel. Cancel.

148
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:32,080
Stop. Thank you. So, you know, like they maybe there is it is it within the realm of possibility.

149
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,680
But also within the realm of possibility is they never launch a streaming service. That's

150
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,840
what I love about this prediction is it's it's got it's a full spectrum possibility

151
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
here.

152
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,400
They could, in theory, just make content and sell it on iTunes on demand that way without

153
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,440
a proper streaming service. But no, they're definitely going to do it. And it's probably

154
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,360
not going to work, at least very well on Linux.

155
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,140
The only thing I think crazier than my prediction would be like some sort of prediction that

156
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,160
like Linux gaming is going to take off or something.

157
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,240
Well, that's my next prediction. And that is that Steam Linux market share will crack

158
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,520
5%. It's under 1% right now.

159
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:15,080
Yeah, it's 0.8. 0.8. You think you're going to go to 5% in one year?

160
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
Yep.

161
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:26,160
That's you're giving me a hard time. I mean, I just don't even see it. What's the Mac at?

162
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,800
What is it? What is the Mac OS market share right now for Steam OS? Is it even above 10%?

163
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,080
This is a bold prediction, Joe. Do you think Proton is going to be what fuels this meteoric

164
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,000
rise in Linux gaming?

165
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,160
Well, that's certainly part of it. But the bigger part of it is not that there's going

166
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:54,860
to be loads more people running Steam on Linux. It's going to be fewer people running Steam

167
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:02,120
on Windows because of the competition that is brewing. And that is Epic and their games

168
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,240
store and also Discord and their game store, which are looking to undercut Steam. And so

169
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,200
you're going to have a lot more titles going over there, potentially exclusives. And I

170
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,240
think that Steam is going to lose its crown as the premium gaming platform. I think you're

171
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,800
going to have a much more distributed three-way race. And as a result, you're going to lose

172
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,980
the Windows users from Steam. And you'll also get more Linux users on Steam. I think that's

173
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,600
going to settle out to be about 5%.

174
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,800
Hmm, that's bold. I mean, right now I'm picturing a future where I'm sitting on my partially

175
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,280
Microsoft-owned Ubuntu desktop watching my Apple streaming video while I download a Steam

176
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:52,240
game where I'm nearly one of the five percenters on the platform. It seems nearly crazy, but

177
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:59,800
not any crazier than my next prediction. And I want to make sure I'm very clear about this.

178
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:05,120
I don't think this is going to be a final product. This may be only beta or even maybe

179
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:11,080
pre-release. I don't know what they're going to call it. But I believe this year, in some

180
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:16,600
form or another, maybe preview, maybe beta, Microsoft will launch Office as an Electron

181
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:24,540
app. Maybe just to like Office 365 subscribers. Maybe it's only a small preview or a beta.

182
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:31,080
But my thought process has really been over 2018, looking at what Microsoft has done.

183
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:37,040
When they acquired GitHub, they also acquired Electron. When they announced the transition

184
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:44,900
from Edge HTML to Chromium, they also announced making Windows a really, really first-class

185
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:52,920
Electron platform. And they own Electron and they can make contributions to Chromium.

186
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,040
They have the potential to build something really significant. And if you look at some

187
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,680
of their more recent products, like the new version of Skype and other things, VS Code,

188
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:10,260
etc., they're Electron based. I think we could see a truly cross-platform Office 365 desktop

189
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:15,680
style application, something along this line. Maybe it's just Word, but it's an Office style

190
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,680
application that is released as an Electron app by Microsoft. Maybe it's preview in 2019.

191
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,080
I can't disagree with any of that. That seems very likely to me. I think that we'll even

192
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,880
get to a point where we've got a snap of it as well. I think it'll run across basically

193
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,680
all Linux distributions or at least most of them. As soon as you said that, I thought,

194
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,240
yeah, I'm fully on board with that prediction. I can totally see that happening.

195
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,540
You can kind of look back at some of their recent moves over 2018 and see them lining

196
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,700
up behind Electron. And having a couple of conversations with a couple of different developers

197
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,260
down there, I've been told about a couple of different in-house projects that are Electron

198
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,520
based that we're like, what? You've got to be kidding me. You guys are working with Electron

199
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,320
on that? Yeah, we're doing these things. I don't want to say who or what. I know that's

200
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:08,360
very vague, but it sort of changed my perspective on what Microsoft would be willing to ship.

201
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,180
And when we look at Skype and VS Code, I think we see those things individually, and we don't

202
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,780
really take into account that they're essentially Electron applications. And we don't appreciate

203
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:24,840
how sometimes companies can test the waters and trial balloon things with some products

204
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:29,400
before they move their most treasured product to a new platform.

205
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,400
And I suspect, based on the conversations I've had, that that's what Microsoft's been

206
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,800
doing for the last couple of years. And this final drop of Internet Explorer and Edge,

207
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:47,040
which is a 20-year legacy and a move over to Chromium, is such a significant change

208
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:52,440
that the only thing that would make them truly willing to drop that 20-year heritage and

209
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:59,960
make a new shift like that would be to serve a bigger goal long term, like making Windows

210
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:05,080
one of the best platforms to run desktop Electron applications, which to us probably sounds

211
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,080
horrible, but to the business world is absolutely necessary.

212
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,920
Yeah, and just because they'll be the best experience on Windows doesn't mean that they

213
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,000
won't work on the other platforms. Yeah. So we should hopefully benefit. I hope so. We

214
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,640
should, well, if running Office can be considered a benefit.

215
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,720
Yeah, and Electron applications. At least we have them.

216
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,040
Yeah. Right. Well, you can't filibuster this anymore. We have to get into Bitcoin.

217
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
All right. All right.

218
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:39,000
So we had our predicted highs, lows, and the price on the 1st of December 2018. It's worth

219
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
mentioning that when we recorded this, it was before the crash, basically. It was...

220
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,080
We recorded a bit earlier than we are this time, didn't we? And it was riding high. It

221
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,200
was nearly at 20,000. And so we got a bit carried away is the bottom line.

222
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,240
Yeah. It wouldn't even be a topic of discussion this year. It's not, you know, like the hype

223
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,860
on Bitcoin is just totally dead now. Back at the end of last year, though, it was what

224
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,280
everybody was talking about.

225
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,900
Yeah. So for the highs, I said 120,000 and you said 100,000. And I was close because

226
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:19,680
it was actually 117,000. Oh, no, no. 17,000 was the actual high. And that was on January

227
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:25,880
6th. So it's just been downhill ever since. So yeah, we were kind of a little bit off

228
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
there.

229
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,040
Yeah. It was supposed to be over 100,000 for either one of us. You went a little higher.

230
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:39,440
I went 100,000. You went 120. But as we record right now, it's 3,800. 3,800. That's so bad.

231
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,400
Yeah. Well, the price on December the 1st, I had said it would be 100,000. You said it

232
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,480
would be 107,000, which was higher than you thought the high would be.

233
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Yeah. I know. I know.

234
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,560
Yeah. I think you got a bit of a rush of blood to the head there. And yeah, the actual price

235
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,520
was about 4,000. So we were just slightly off there.

236
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,000
See, this is what happens. See, Joe, you made me do a prediction and this is what happens.

237
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,360
I blame you for all of this. Not only my wrong prediction, but for the crash itself is actually

238
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,480
your fault as far as I'm concerned.

239
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,080
Yeah. So the lows, we were kind of a little bit off there as well.

240
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,080
Oh, weird.

241
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,680
I said 15,000 and you said 10,000.

242
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:25,520
Yeah. I wish it hadn't gone below 10,000 to be honest with you. And then when it got to

243
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,160
5,000, I thought that'd be the floor. And then when it got to 4,000, I thought that'd

244
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:35,360
be the floor. Part of what's always factored into where I try to guess where Bitcoin is

245
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,280
going is the fact that there is a limited quantity. There's like 21 million or so that'll

246
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,880
ever be created. And you figure a lot of people are losing them. A lot of people are hoarding

247
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:52,440
them. So you either have a situation where over time Bitcoin will get more valuable or

248
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,060
it'll completely be worthless. And it'll be, you know, just, I mean, maybe a couple of

249
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:03,640
bucks at best. And I just, you just don't know which way it's going to go. But at this

250
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,400
point in time, towards the end of 2018, the general narrative is that the crypto market

251
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:15,560
has burst and that things are struggling. And that it's the end of Bitcoin. If that's

252
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:19,960
true or not, time will tell. Obviously you just have no way of knowing, right? In a year

253
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,320
it could be completely different.

254
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,000
Yeah. Yeah. There's all talk of now is a great time to get into gaming because the graphics

255
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,880
cards are cheap again because no one really wants them for mining the altcoins. But yeah,

256
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:38,080
so the, the actual low was 3,200 ish and that was in mid December.

257
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,080
Wow.

258
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,680
That's as we record. It may well be by the time this goes out that it's lower than that.

259
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,120
So although it does seem to have bounced back a bit, but there's just no way to know is

260
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
there.

261
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,600
No, no. And, and you know, anything could really influence from a scam, a exchange going

262
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,040
down or an economy collapsing somewhere. All these things play into the Bitcoin price.

263
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,160
It's a worldwide internet currency. And so things all around the world impacted, unlike,

264
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,200
you know, regional currencies where at least you could say here, the dollar in the States

265
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,100
is impacted mostly by things that are happening with dollar or with the oil price. But that's

266
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,400
pretty much it. But with Bitcoin, it could be politics in China that are influencing

267
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,560
the prices here in the States. It's just a totally new phenomenon.

268
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,920
Yeah. All right. Well, we have to do predictions, but there's just, take these with a pinch

269
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,920
of salt because

270
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Oh no.

271
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,920
Who knows?

272
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,800
Oh no. You're making me do this again. Oh no.

273
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:41,480
Yep. So what's your prediction for the high in 2019?

274
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,520
Hmm. $12,000.

275
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,600
Interesting. So you think it is going to go back up significantly? My high, 6,000.

276
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,600
Really?

277
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Yep.

278
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:58,720
Hmm. I wouldn't be surprised if it stabilizes around 10, maybe. I could also see it completely

279
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,200
collapsing though, to be honest with you. In even just a few months, I could see that

280
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,400
happening. So it's a tough call really.

281
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,560
Well, that's why I think the low is going to be 900.

282
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:13,480
All right. Okay. All right. Hmm. All right. So I'd say $300 for my low.

283
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,080
Right. So you think it's going to be a huge range then?

284
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,480
That is a massacre if that happens though. That's an absolute massacre if that happens.

285
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,120
Yeah. I can't help but feel if it goes as low as 300, although actually if it goes below

286
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,240
a thousand, then surely the bottom will just fall out of it and it'll just go to nothing

287
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,320
and it'll just be proved to be the Ponzi scheme that everyone said it was.

288
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,800
Or would everybody start buying like crazy? Because now it's below $1,000. So buy up like

289
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:43,520
crazy because there's only ever going to be 21 million. The people just, you never know

290
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,480
how they're going to react to that kind of thing.

291
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,680
Yeah. All right. Well, December 1st then, where do you think it's going to be?

292
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,640
I'm going to say $9,200.

293
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,520
Right. That's pretty high. I think it's going to be $2,000.

294
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:02,480
Yeah. I feel like I went too high, but I feel like it's either going to be high or it's

295
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,320
going to be completely low. And if it's going to be high, it's probably going to be higher

296
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,000
than what I predicted. So I don't think I like my number either way.

297
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,400
My numbers, let me justify my numbers to you.

298
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
All right. Okay.

299
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,600
I think that what we're going to see is a bit of a rally now up to $6,000 over the next

300
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,600
month or so.

301
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,000
I can feel that coming. Yeah.

302
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,880
And then I think we're going to see a crash down to $900. And then I think it's going

303
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,960
to struggle and it'll sort of inch its way up slowly, slowly, slowly. And then by the

304
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,600
end of the year, be around $2,000.

305
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:38,320
Yeah. The only way my predictions work out is if it finds a new floor and then it just

306
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:45,480
very slowly builds its way up towards $10,000. And I think if that doesn't happen, if that

307
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,440
stability doesn't happen, then Bitcoin is pretty much screwed as anything but just a

308
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,840
transfer mechanism. You know what I mean? You can't use it as a currency if it's moving

309
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,120
this much. By this point in its lifecycle, it needs to start stabilizing now. And that

310
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:02,680
might be what we're seeing because it has been hanging out in the $3,000 price range

311
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:09,640
now for a while. And it could slowly build up to $10,000 and just take the whole year

312
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,840
to get there. And I think that would actually be a healthy signal for Bitcoin that it's

313
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,400
slowing down. But I think it's the least likely. I think you're probably going to win that

314
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,400
one.

315
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
Watch it end up being $200,000.

316
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:30,040
Well, if it is, we'll own up to it. I mean, now we got to admit it. We're on the record.

317
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:34,400
We'll see what happens. This year couldn't have gotten any worse. So let's see. Check
