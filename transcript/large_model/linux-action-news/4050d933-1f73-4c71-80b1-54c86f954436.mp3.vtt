Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.180 --> 00:19.380
This is episode six, recorded on June 18th, 2017.

00:19.380 --> 00:20.380
I'm Chris.

00:20.380 --> 00:21.380
And I'm Joe.

00:21.380 --> 00:23.420
Yes, and hello to everyone out there, including the fathers.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.340
Happy Father's Day to you.

00:25.340 --> 00:26.980
Today we have quite the gift.

00:26.980 --> 00:31.400
It has been a busy news week in open source, and I think our first story is probably our

00:31.400 --> 00:32.400
favorite.

00:32.400 --> 00:36.720
I'm pretty happy to announce that a friend of the show, Mr. Aiki, founder of Solus, is

00:36.720 --> 00:38.240
going full time with the project.

00:38.240 --> 00:42.100
Yeah, he came on Unplugged, didn't he, this week and talked about it.

00:42.100 --> 00:43.220
And it's excellent news.

00:43.220 --> 00:45.720
It's excellent news for him personally.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.000
And it's excellent news for Solus as a project.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.120
Some people have doubted that they were serious about it, even though looking at the project,

00:53.120 --> 00:55.160
I don't know how you could do that.

00:55.160 --> 00:59.960
But now instead of just doing it in his spare time, he's going to be full time on it, putting

00:59.960 --> 01:03.140
all his resources into it and treating it as a proper job.

01:03.140 --> 01:05.160
And so he's relying on Patreon to do that.

01:05.160 --> 01:08.660
So he's taking a pay cut, but it's got to be good news for Solus.

01:08.660 --> 01:13.440
And I think the wider Linux ecosystem, certainly the desktop ecosystem, because it's going

01:13.440 --> 01:15.040
to drive more competition.

01:15.040 --> 01:16.040
Yep.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.860
I think that's exactly why we both thought it was a good idea to put it right here is

01:18.860 --> 01:23.160
as two desktop Linux users, we're very excited to see the competition step up a notch and

01:23.160 --> 01:24.560
it's going to be great for everybody.

01:24.560 --> 01:25.560
Yeah.

01:25.560 --> 01:29.120
And it's probably going to accelerate the KDE version, which you know is coming.

01:29.120 --> 01:33.000
We're going to get a KDE ISO sooner or later, Plasma desktop.

01:33.000 --> 01:38.920
And it just means that his plan to move to Qt and everything is going to be accelerated

01:38.920 --> 01:45.360
because it's amazing how much work him and the other guys on the team get done part time.

01:45.360 --> 01:50.400
So now in a few weeks when he goes full time on it, I think it's just going to accelerate

01:50.400 --> 01:53.240
and it's going to be unbelievable development pace.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.840
I think a lot of projects have been working hard.

01:54.840 --> 01:59.440
In fact, we have some release news to get through starting with Debian 9 Stretch released

01:59.440 --> 02:02.240
yesterday after 26 months of development.

02:02.240 --> 02:06.600
Debian presents the new stable version 9 codename Stretch, which is going to be supported for

02:06.600 --> 02:07.600
the next five years.

02:07.600 --> 02:11.440
Yeah, after 26 months, it's finally ready.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.740
And there's some good stuff in here.

02:13.740 --> 02:17.760
If you install it, it's not that much different from 8.

02:17.760 --> 02:21.320
But if you look at the release notes, you find that they have done a lot of stuff here.

02:21.320 --> 02:25.600
And I think one of the most important ones is the reproducible builds project.

02:25.600 --> 02:35.280
So over 90% of Debian 9 is reproducible, which means that you can actually produce an exact

02:35.280 --> 02:40.480
binary using the source code because that's something I've often not worried about.

02:40.480 --> 02:43.840
But it's something I've thought about that you've got the source code and you've got

02:43.840 --> 02:48.240
the binary, but unless you can produce a binary that is exactly the same, then should you

02:48.240 --> 02:49.240
trust it?

02:49.240 --> 02:53.920
Well, coming from Debian, yes, and you have all sorts of signing and stuff where I'm not

02:53.920 --> 02:54.920
particularly worried.

02:54.920 --> 02:59.840
But I think that it is important for open source to have this reproducibility.

02:59.840 --> 03:05.320
And it's good to see Debian making effort here and making it over 90% of the packages

03:05.320 --> 03:07.320
in Debian are going to be reproducible.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.320
That's great.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.320
Yeah, that's huge.

03:09.320 --> 03:13.520
And it's really an important verification feature, which some very high security installations

03:13.520 --> 03:14.820
require.

03:14.820 --> 03:20.360
Also kind of notable, I think they made the big first switch to the modern branch of GnuPG

03:20.360 --> 03:21.360
in this version of Debian.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.520
So that's also kind of a nice security improvement.

03:23.520 --> 03:28.480
And of course, for us desktop users, Firefox and Thunderbird are officially back in stretch.

03:28.480 --> 03:33.200
They are replacing the de-branded versions of Ice Weasel and Ice Dove.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.120
Yeah, it's good that they finally sorted that out.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.880
They sorted out a while back, but now we've got a proper release with it.

03:38.880 --> 03:41.220
Hopefully we can just put that stuff behind us now.

03:41.220 --> 03:45.800
And speaking of Debian 9, Tails 3.0 is out this week, which is based on stretch.

03:45.800 --> 03:49.840
Yeah, which is the ultimate privacy distro, isn't it?

03:49.840 --> 03:51.780
They really are stepping it up too.

03:51.780 --> 03:55.120
So they have something they've been working on hard for a while.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.240
I think like three years in the making is Tails Greeter, which is an application that

03:59.240 --> 04:01.040
configures Tails at startup.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.960
And it's been completely redesigned for ease of use.

04:02.960 --> 04:07.500
Now, the whole idea with Tails is to give users a secure out of the box experience that

04:07.500 --> 04:12.240
supports encrypted storage, GPG, all of the features you might want for online banking,

04:12.240 --> 04:14.240
cryptocurrency, or if you're just a little paranoid.

04:14.240 --> 04:17.660
And now they're trying to bridge that gap with things like the Greeter and other features

04:17.660 --> 04:22.200
like polishing their GNOME desktop that make it just basically a usable desktop distro

04:22.200 --> 04:23.200
now.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.720
Yeah, and of course, Tor, we can't forget that.

04:24.720 --> 04:28.280
That's one of the major selling points here, that all the traffic is routed through Tor.

04:28.280 --> 04:32.000
Yeah, and they make it really easy to use proxy services and set up VPNs.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
It's pretty nice.

04:33.000 --> 04:38.320
Like Tor Browser 7.01, which is based on Firefox 52, which is kind of nice because that's a

04:38.320 --> 04:40.120
long term support version of 52.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.020
Yeah, they call it ESR, don't they?

04:42.020 --> 04:43.020
Extended Support Release.

04:43.020 --> 04:44.480
Yeah, Extended Support Release.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.800
And there's also one caveat with Tails 3.0.

04:46.800 --> 04:49.960
This is the version they've dropped 32-bit support.

04:49.960 --> 04:54.960
So older machines, kind of out of the picture, it's going to only work on 64-bit systems.

04:54.960 --> 04:59.560
But to be fair, is GNOME going to work on a 32-bit only system?

04:59.560 --> 05:00.800
Not very well.

05:00.800 --> 05:01.800
Probably not.

05:01.800 --> 05:07.000
Other gotcha, and it doesn't apply across the board, but Tails is failing to start on

05:07.000 --> 05:10.720
some computers with Intel graphics, and there's a link in the show notes about that.

05:10.720 --> 05:14.520
Yeah, and it's pretty picky about what USB sticks it will work on.

05:14.520 --> 05:19.320
It didn't work on my USB 3.0 SanDisk one, because they apparently can't be trusted.

05:19.320 --> 05:24.280
But then I tried another USB 2.0 one, and waited and waited for it to DD, and waited

05:24.280 --> 05:27.520
and waited for it to boot, and that worked fine.

05:27.520 --> 05:35.320
Congratulations, you have met bug 12696 in their database, which is something wrong with

05:35.320 --> 05:37.520
working with some types of USB media.

05:37.520 --> 05:41.200
And did you get the error skipping non-removable device or something to that degree?

05:41.200 --> 05:42.200
Because there is a workaround.

05:42.200 --> 05:43.720
No, I can't remember what it was now.

05:43.720 --> 05:46.040
I think it was just sort of a black screen in the end.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.040
Okay.

05:47.040 --> 05:50.400
You might check in the known issues section, there is a workaround you can use, a little

05:50.400 --> 05:54.560
pearl magic, and for some reason, I guess it opens up more USB sticks.

05:54.560 --> 05:55.560
Okay.

05:55.560 --> 06:00.120
But the big question here is, are we actually going to use this for anything?

06:00.120 --> 06:06.440
I'm happy enough with a standard Xubuntu desktop that's fully up to date to do my online banking.

06:06.440 --> 06:10.560
I don't have any real need for Tor apart from a bit of testing.

06:10.560 --> 06:11.880
Is it something that you're going to use?

06:11.880 --> 06:15.520
Because for me, I've tested it out, and it's good to know it's there.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.920
But personally, I can't see myself using it.

06:17.920 --> 06:22.960
If I was still in the position of owning a lot of Bitcoin, and I mean a lot, and I wanted

06:22.960 --> 06:27.040
to move large amounts around or something like that, I could see myself booting this

06:27.040 --> 06:32.320
up in a virtual environment or having a computer dedicated to certain types of communication.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.560
There have been moments where I've had a couple of email exchanges where I had to be really

06:35.560 --> 06:39.800
kind of careful with the email, and I could see a machine dedicated running a distribution

06:39.800 --> 06:40.800
like this.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.600
But for the most part, I'm kind of drawing a blank for my personal use.

06:42.600 --> 06:44.280
I don't think I'm fancy and important enough.

06:44.280 --> 06:48.480
I'm not like some secret agent or some millionaire working with funds.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.800
Just a podcaster in Washington, so I don't really have a need for it.

06:51.800 --> 06:56.200
Yeah, there are some people who are going to find this very useful, journalists dealing

06:56.200 --> 06:58.320
with Snowden and that kind of thing.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.320
Absolutely.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.320
Yeah, that's a very good point.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.320
And in some countries as well.

07:01.320 --> 07:05.000
I mean, the UK is getting that way, so maybe I'll have more use for it in the future.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
That's true.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.520
And things can always change here in the States.

07:07.520 --> 07:11.560
So something that might apply to more of us is Firefox 54.

07:11.560 --> 07:16.480
It's luring you back in, Chrome Switchers, with its new content process, a separate UI

07:16.480 --> 07:20.920
process, and get ready for it, ladies and gentlemen, a GPU acceleration process.

07:20.920 --> 07:26.000
Yeah, it's only been eight years they've been working on this, so finally, we get there.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.600
You like that I left that part out to make you say it?

07:28.600 --> 07:30.920
Yeah, I did totally stop there.

07:30.920 --> 07:36.880
I know I am kind of a little underwhelmed because it's also not available for a lot

07:36.880 --> 07:42.000
of us if you have add-ons that block it, which is the case on Ubuntu right now.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.440
Yeah, the box with Ubuntu, because of the Ubuntu modifications add-on, that doesn't

07:46.440 --> 07:47.440
work with it.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.080
But I think that will get fixed fairly soon, hopefully.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.080
I agree.

07:51.080 --> 07:55.400
And one of the great things about Firefox is the add-ons, and I've got a ton running.

07:55.400 --> 08:00.480
And so therefore, all it takes is one of them to not be compatible, and then I don't get

08:00.480 --> 08:01.560
this benefit.

08:01.560 --> 08:07.040
And so that's why when I first heard it was having this multi-process architecture, I

08:07.040 --> 08:09.720
was using it and thinking, it's not really any different.

08:09.720 --> 08:13.320
And then I read a bit more about it, OK, that's why, because of my add-ons.

08:13.320 --> 08:16.300
Right, and that's really my favorite thing about Firefox as well.

08:16.300 --> 08:17.900
But there is a path.

08:17.900 --> 08:22.480
So Firefox 54 includes the new Web Extension APIs, which are hooks that allow for add-ons

08:22.480 --> 08:25.440
that work across multiple types of browsers.

08:25.440 --> 08:30.980
And in November, when Firefox, I think, 57 is released, Firefox is only going to support

08:30.980 --> 08:33.580
the add-ons that use Web Extension APIs.

08:33.580 --> 08:38.440
Everything else is going away, including Firefox's original Zul overlay add-ons.

08:38.440 --> 08:44.060
And you talk about Firefox 57, I remember the big upgrade from 3 to 3.5, it makes you

08:44.060 --> 08:45.140
feel old, doesn't it?

08:45.140 --> 08:47.560
These numbers, Joe, no, these numbers are ridiculous.

08:47.560 --> 08:52.360
I remember when it hit 13, and I thought, wow, Firefox 13.

08:52.360 --> 08:56.800
And then Chrome comes along with its 60s, and it's just getting out of control.

08:56.800 --> 08:57.800
Yeah.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.000
Do you think this is too little too late for Firefox?

09:00.000 --> 09:04.400
Because the market share, most people use Chrome now.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.760
Even on Windows, they're not using IE and Edge.

09:07.760 --> 09:12.400
They're basically using Chrome because they've just realized that it's a much better experience.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.720
And Firefox just seems to have fallen by the wayside.

09:14.720 --> 09:20.920
Yeah, it's default in a lot of desktop Linux distros, but one of the first things people

09:20.920 --> 09:24.320
do is install Chrome, but presumably that's one of the first things you do when you install

09:24.320 --> 09:25.320
a distro.

09:25.320 --> 09:26.320
Admittedly, yes.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.120
And I think it's going to be that way for a while.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.760
I don't think it's ever too late.

09:29.760 --> 09:33.920
It's not like the web's going anywhere, and Chrome's not getting any smaller.

09:33.920 --> 09:38.400
And Firefox can just keep chipping away at this, and it could end up being the iPhone

09:38.400 --> 09:43.780
Android situation where a smaller percentage of the market is on iPhone, but generally

09:43.780 --> 09:48.560
those consumers are more appealing to developers, so they release on the iOS platform first.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.440
Something like that could happen with the Firefox Chrome situation where Chrome ends

09:51.440 --> 09:56.400
up being the vast majority, but Firefox walks away with a solid 20% maybe.

09:56.400 --> 10:00.220
I'm totally making up numbers here, but you see how there could be a bit of victory for

10:00.220 --> 10:02.880
Firefox without having to be the king.

10:02.880 --> 10:07.540
Well, talking about tails there, that's what Firefox is great for, isn't it?

10:07.540 --> 10:14.680
The fact that it is completely open source and can be used for other projects like tails

10:14.680 --> 10:16.920
and the Tor browser.

10:16.920 --> 10:21.400
Whereas with Chrome, okay, you've got Chromium that you can use, but even that needs some

10:21.400 --> 10:22.420
proprietary stuff.

10:22.420 --> 10:30.320
So if you care about privacy, then Firefox is the browser for you, presumably.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.120
I think they could make the performance argument pretty soon as well.

10:33.120 --> 10:36.840
Benchmarks that we've linked in the show notes from ours show that it's pretty competitive

10:36.840 --> 10:38.640
in memory usage and speed.

10:38.640 --> 10:43.720
Yeah, but it just doesn't have that brand loyalty that it once did.

10:43.720 --> 10:47.080
It was once upon a time before Chrome came along, it was just huge, wasn't it?

10:47.080 --> 10:52.560
It was starting to seriously compete with Internet Explorer, whereas now Chrome has

10:52.560 --> 10:53.560
taken over.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.920
I think it was a few weeks ago there was that Chrome has won post.

10:56.920 --> 10:57.920
Yeah.

10:57.920 --> 11:01.520
Well, I kind of feel optimistic if they just keep going in this direction, but there is

11:01.520 --> 11:04.640
also just a bit of housekeeping with the 54 release.

11:04.640 --> 11:09.720
Mozilla has shut down the Aurora release channel instead of a four-stage release pipeline

11:09.720 --> 11:14.520
where they have nightly, Aurora, beta, and then stable.

11:14.520 --> 11:18.600
Firefox will now just jump from nightly to the beta channel, cleaning things up a little

11:18.600 --> 11:19.600
bit.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.240
Yeah, simplifying things.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.000
I'm not going to miss it personally.

11:23.000 --> 11:28.740
Maybe some people will, but if it lets them concentrate more on things like this multiprocess

11:28.740 --> 11:30.520
stuff, then I'm all for it.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.720
Yeah, it's more straightforward.

11:31.720 --> 11:34.200
To be honest with you, I always found it a little confusing as an outsider.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.200
I thought it was a little excessive.

11:35.200 --> 11:43.320
I could see needing a channel like that internally, but for the public testing it seemed too much.

11:43.320 --> 11:44.720
Keep it simple with DigitalOcean.

11:44.720 --> 11:48.280
Go to digitalocean.com and use the promo code, here's the thing, after you've created your

11:48.280 --> 11:49.280
account.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.240
You hit that, it applies to your account, and you get a $10 credit.

11:52.240 --> 11:58.320
DigitalOcean is a simple, fast, easy way to spin up a Linux system on a great infrastructure.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.120
You can get deployed within seconds.

12:00.120 --> 12:05.000
All systems use SSD, from the itty-bitties to the huge, ginormous monster systems.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.880
They have super-fast lightning network, up to 40 gigabits into the hypervisors with data

12:08.880 --> 12:13.720
centers all over the world, a simple, intuitive API to work with it, storage you can attach

12:13.720 --> 12:18.480
easily, and one of my favorite features with DigitalOcean is their documentation.

12:18.480 --> 12:21.800
They have a lot of one-click deployment, open source projects, but then, of course, you

12:21.800 --> 12:24.560
start using these things and they're awesome, you want to take it a little further.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.840
Here's one they've just posted recently.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.840
It really would work on any Ubuntu system.

12:27.840 --> 12:34.040
Here's a tutorial on how to enable SFTP without shell access on Ubuntu 16.04.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.040
Go take advantage of that.

12:35.040 --> 12:38.520
Go to DigitalOcean.com, and if you create an account, use our promo code, Here's the

12:38.520 --> 12:44.000
Thing, DigitalOcean.com, promo code, Here's the Thing, great cloud servers in 55 seconds

12:44.000 --> 12:50.180
or less, DigitalOcean.com, promo code, Here's the Thing.

12:50.180 --> 12:54.800
Last week, we talked about the Ubuntu kernel live patching coming to 14.04, and we had

12:54.800 --> 12:57.640
quite a few questions about that.

12:57.640 --> 13:03.200
Joe, you reached out to Dustin Kirkland about this, didn't you, and he got back with some

13:03.200 --> 13:04.680
very thorough answers.

13:04.680 --> 13:05.840
Yeah, he sure did.

13:05.840 --> 13:10.120
So Dustin Kirkland's the Ubuntu product and strategy guy at Canonical and also, I think,

13:10.120 --> 13:13.120
one of the main people behind livepatch because I chatted with him right when it came out.

13:13.120 --> 13:16.520
So I knew he would be the guy to ask, and Joe, you really stumped me.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.640
You said, well, what happens if, say, you've been running for eight to nine months with

13:19.640 --> 13:23.900
livepatches coming in, you've never rebooted your system, and the power goes out or your

13:23.900 --> 13:28.160
system crashes and reboots, are all those patches reinstalled or do you boot up with a vulnerable

13:28.160 --> 13:29.460
kernel again?

13:29.460 --> 13:32.480
And so Dustin's response kind of broke down in two ways.

13:32.480 --> 13:37.000
He said, first of all, they release an Ubuntu kernel update every three weeks, like Clockwork.

13:37.000 --> 13:41.960
So if you install that kernel patch every three weeks, you get all of the updates.

13:41.960 --> 13:45.400
But assuming you haven't been installing your patches every three weeks and your system

13:45.400 --> 13:50.120
reboots or you needed to reboot an old kernel for software compatibility, then yeah, initially

13:50.120 --> 13:55.320
it would boot up as an unpatched kernel, and then after 60 seconds, the livepatches would

13:55.320 --> 13:59.860
be reapplied back to the system, right back into memory.

13:59.860 --> 14:00.860
And why 60 seconds?

14:00.860 --> 14:04.240
So that's just in case there's any kind of critical issues, you could stop it.

14:04.240 --> 14:07.680
And depending on how old your kernel is, you could have many livepatches.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.200
We speculated there probably hadn't been a lot of livepatches.

14:10.200 --> 14:14.880
Well, Dustin's been running it on his local system, and he has 44 livepatches applied

14:14.880 --> 14:15.880
to his system alone.

14:15.880 --> 14:19.960
Yeah, and he said that there have been hundreds to date because we speculated there were only

14:19.960 --> 14:20.960
a few, as you say.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.240
But no, there have been hundreds.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.320
Yeah, it's fascinating the way this system works.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.320
And I was confused.

14:25.320 --> 14:26.520
It's like, how are you doing this?

14:26.520 --> 14:28.640
Are you delivering these as apt packages?

14:28.640 --> 14:30.720
Are they available to my package manager?

14:30.720 --> 14:32.100
Can I uninstall them?

14:32.100 --> 14:35.880
And it's the patches that they release as a standard release every three weeks, those

14:35.880 --> 14:38.160
come down as standard apt packages.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.920
But the live kernel patches are being delivered with Snap.

14:40.920 --> 14:45.000
Yeah, which we shouldn't be surprised about, given that that is what Canonical is putting

14:45.000 --> 14:47.760
most of their resources into seemingly these days.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.400
Yeah, but talk about a real dogfooding experience here.

14:50.400 --> 14:54.040
I mean, this has got to be one of the most critical ways they could use Snap packages,

14:54.040 --> 14:56.160
if there was one, and in scale.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.920
That's a pretty big testament to Snap packages.

14:57.920 --> 15:03.160
Yeah, and the fact that they rolled it out in production to anyone who wants it means

15:03.160 --> 15:04.560
that they must be confident with it.

15:04.560 --> 15:09.200
Yeah, he also sent me just a quick setup on how to get started on my 1604 system.

15:09.200 --> 15:14.040
And also today, I noticed that they are including some graphical options in future releases

15:14.040 --> 15:15.080
of Ubuntu to get started.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.240
So that could be really interesting.

15:16.240 --> 15:20.360
Yeah, that's going to lower the barrier to entry, which I suppose is good, but I still

15:20.360 --> 15:23.360
stand by my concerns.

15:23.360 --> 15:25.000
I mean, okay, fair enough.

15:25.000 --> 15:32.400
You've got this 60 seconds, but I just, I like to apply the patches, reboot, and no,

15:32.400 --> 15:33.400
that's it.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.840
Well, you could do that every three weeks and be solid, and then this live patch service

15:36.840 --> 15:40.800
would just sort of get you in between if there was something major, like a major vulnerability

15:40.800 --> 15:41.800
that came down the road.

15:41.800 --> 15:44.880
Yeah, I think that is the use case that I would have for it, really.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.280
Big thank you to Dustin, though, for a really complete response.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.880
It really helped improve my understanding of how it works, and it seems like a really

15:50.880 --> 15:52.440
solid system.

15:52.440 --> 15:56.080
And I'm going to try it out, and I'll report back to you guys at some point.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.720
I look forward to hearing about it.

15:58.720 --> 16:04.560
So let's stay with Ubuntu kind of, and as we know, they dropped that bombshell a few

16:04.560 --> 16:11.720
months ago about abandoning Unity and Convergence and Ubuntu Touch, but Ubiports, who were originally

16:11.720 --> 16:17.640
just about porting Ubuntu Touch to new devices, vowed to carry on with it.

16:17.640 --> 16:23.320
And some people were skeptical, including me, I'm afraid, but here we are with the first

16:23.320 --> 16:26.560
stable over-the-air update.

16:26.560 --> 16:32.360
And I've tried it out on a Nexus 5, and I must say, it's working pretty well.

16:32.360 --> 16:40.360
I don't know if that's where Ubuntu was just before it was axed, you know, shut down, or

16:40.360 --> 16:45.960
whether it's the work of the Ubiports guys, because I had kind of, I'd seen it coming,

16:45.960 --> 16:49.640
so I'd kind of lost interest in Ubuntu Touch, to be honest.

16:49.640 --> 16:56.320
Whereas now, my interest has ramped up, definitely, with this OTA, and they're calling it stable,

16:56.320 --> 17:00.640
and from my brief testing of it today, I think it's fair to call it stable.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.380
You know, Joe, I think it's a little of both, reading the release notes.

17:03.380 --> 17:08.140
It seems like a lot of hard work has gone into this, and they've implemented some new

17:08.140 --> 17:10.880
features like the Open Store, have you had a chance to look at that?

17:10.880 --> 17:12.340
Yeah, I had a quick look at it.

17:12.340 --> 17:16.000
One thing that jumped out at me is, you don't need an account to install apps, you can just

17:16.000 --> 17:20.040
open it up and just start installing stuff, which I think is great.

17:20.040 --> 17:24.980
That was always a bit of an annoyance before, having to create an Ubuntu account and give

17:24.980 --> 17:30.040
them my email address and everything, whereas now, just open up Open Store and start installing

17:30.040 --> 17:31.040
stuff.

17:31.040 --> 17:32.040
Wow, that is really impressive.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.040
Big tip of the hat.

17:33.040 --> 17:35.880
And I'm sure, you know, things could always change, but that's nice just to be able to

17:35.880 --> 17:36.880
get started.

17:36.880 --> 17:40.920
Speaking of just being able to get started, a terminal and a file browser are now pre-installed.

17:40.920 --> 17:41.920
You know, it's the little things.

17:41.920 --> 17:46.720
Yeah, and the terminal, I took some photos and then SCPed them up to another machine,

17:46.720 --> 17:53.280
worked absolutely perfectly, and it's so refreshing to have a proper Linux box in your hand rather

17:53.280 --> 17:57.720
than trying to install apps and try and hack things to get a proper terminal going.

17:57.720 --> 18:01.960
Now, I'm going to be real with you, this isn't going to get me away from a mainstream smartphone

18:01.960 --> 18:07.280
anytime soon, but I am so thankful to see projects out there that are hedging against

18:07.280 --> 18:08.280
Android.

18:08.280 --> 18:10.960
And one of the things this project is involved with is Hallium.

18:10.960 --> 18:14.120
As you may know, we've talked about it, I think, in brief on Jupyter Broadcasting in

18:14.120 --> 18:19.120
the past, but it's a layer that's going to standardize the Android hardware compatibility

18:19.120 --> 18:21.080
between Linux distributions.

18:21.080 --> 18:24.960
So this layer is something that they can all target, and it solves the problem that Android

18:24.960 --> 18:29.280
device drivers can't be used natively in a regular Linux system.

18:29.280 --> 18:33.200
Yeah, it aims to de-duplicate effort, doesn't it, whereas you had all these projects doing

18:33.200 --> 18:34.680
the same thing.

18:34.680 --> 18:38.680
Now they've decided to get together, like Plasma Mobile, for example.

18:38.680 --> 18:42.160
And so it's good to see that that is actually coming along now.

18:42.160 --> 18:47.320
Yeah, the Plasma Mobile folks showed off Plasma Mobile running on a Fairphone 2 using that

18:47.320 --> 18:51.240
Hallium intermediary layer today, I think, or yesterday.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.000
So it's getting pretty close.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.920
And that's, if nothing else, something that's going to be benefiting a lot of open source

18:56.920 --> 18:57.920
projects.

18:57.920 --> 19:01.720
And something else that's interesting in this announcement is they're talking about

19:01.720 --> 19:06.680
Andbox, which is a way to run Android apps on Linux.

19:06.680 --> 19:13.080
And they accept, it's really good to see that unlike Canonical, UbiPorts accept that it

19:13.080 --> 19:18.480
is very important for them to be able to run Android apps on Ubuntu.

19:18.480 --> 19:21.920
Well, it's UbiPorts, that's another thing.

19:21.920 --> 19:24.760
They don't know what to call it, but you know, we'll get to that.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.480
Yeah, that's up in the air for now.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.160
Andbox, though, does look interesting.

19:28.160 --> 19:33.080
They compare it to Wine for Linux, and they say it's probably not going to be the same.

19:33.080 --> 19:39.200
But they believe apps like WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Netflix may be usable in Andbox, which

19:39.200 --> 19:41.000
that would be great for the platform.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.440
That seems very ambitious, given that they're going to have to rely on Google Play services

19:44.440 --> 19:45.440
and stuff.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.160
So they're going to have to get that stuff going.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.980
But at least they're thinking about this stuff.

19:48.980 --> 19:54.960
And it's something that, I don't know, was it arrogance of Canonical to not consider

19:54.960 --> 19:55.960
Android compatibility?

19:55.960 --> 20:00.640
Because if you look at something like Sailfish, that has got it, Tizen has got it to some

20:00.640 --> 20:01.920
degree.

20:01.920 --> 20:05.280
And I think it is important to have that for your new platform.

20:05.280 --> 20:11.400
Because if you can get Android apps running, then it opens up so many more apps than the

20:11.400 --> 20:15.600
small number of native ones you have, and attracts people to your platform.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.720
Arrogance could be one way to describe it.

20:17.720 --> 20:21.500
I would be more charitable and say it was probably adhering to a vision, because this

20:21.500 --> 20:25.360
wasn't just about an experience on a phone, it was an experience on the tablet and on

20:25.360 --> 20:26.360
the desktop.

20:26.360 --> 20:30.160
And so you needed Qt and QML applications to really achieve that.

20:30.160 --> 20:33.340
And an Android application looks really awkward in a desktop experience.

20:33.340 --> 20:37.200
So it was probably more adherence to vision, but it might have been tunnel vision that

20:37.200 --> 20:38.760
didn't benefit the platform.

20:38.760 --> 20:41.320
Yeah, I suppose so.

20:41.320 --> 20:46.400
And they talk about Unity, which is y-u-n-i-t.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.400
So unit, unit.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.880
I think it's supposed to be Unity, but it's a stupid name anyway.

20:49.880 --> 20:54.940
And that's the fork of the desktop version of Unity.

20:54.940 --> 20:57.840
And they had originally said they were going to be working with those guys.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.240
Well, it doesn't look like much has happened, but they are acknowledging that, and they

21:01.240 --> 21:06.680
are looking to work with them in the future, so that we'll get proper convergence.

21:06.680 --> 21:12.380
I mean, it's remarkable to me how far they've come in a few short months compared to where

21:12.380 --> 21:13.380
Canonical got with it.

21:13.380 --> 21:16.620
I suppose they've got the building blocks there already, and they seem to be really

21:16.620 --> 21:17.620
going for it.

21:17.620 --> 21:23.580
And we've seen Firefox OS die, we've seen Sailfish not doing brilliantly, Tizen is kind

21:23.580 --> 21:25.680
of ticking along.

21:25.680 --> 21:33.120
And it's good to see a proper GNU slash Linux phone, rather than Android, which is becoming

21:33.120 --> 21:35.320
more and more proprietary.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.280
It'd just be nice to have an alternative.

21:37.280 --> 21:42.620
And they say that we don't need to compete with Android because we're not a big company.

21:42.620 --> 21:45.240
We don't have a huge staff to pay and all that stuff.

21:45.240 --> 21:48.560
So they're just going to make something that is good, and hopefully people will come and

21:48.560 --> 21:49.560
use it.

21:49.560 --> 21:52.120
There's also about enabling older devices.

21:52.120 --> 21:56.480
Your Nexus 5, for example, perfectly good phone, Google's not really interested in maintaining

21:56.480 --> 21:57.740
that anymore.

21:57.740 --> 22:01.600
Why not throw something like this on there and get another year or two of value out of

22:01.600 --> 22:02.600
it?

22:02.600 --> 22:05.640
Or even if you got another nine to 10 months of value out of it, you have a file browser,

22:05.640 --> 22:08.120
you have a web browser, you have a terminal, it's now useful.

22:08.120 --> 22:12.320
Well, I don't know, you still have got lineage available for it and a bunch of other ROMs,

22:12.320 --> 22:16.520
so I'd probably be more inclined to do that if I needed to use this as a daily driver.

22:16.520 --> 22:19.480
It's just your use case and your preference, I think, and it's just nice to have another

22:19.480 --> 22:22.740
option for hardware that's still perfectly good, but the rest of the industry has moved

22:22.740 --> 22:23.740
on from.

22:23.740 --> 22:24.740
Yeah.

22:24.740 --> 22:27.900
Yeah, I really do hope that UbiPorts continues.

22:27.900 --> 22:31.640
I wasn't optimistic, whereas now they've proven me wrong on that.

22:31.640 --> 22:35.680
So I really hope they continue to do so and drive it forward.

22:35.680 --> 22:40.080
And I think sometimes it needs a big shock to shake things up, doesn't it?

22:40.080 --> 22:42.160
And change the perspective on things.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.160
And hopefully they're going to be the people to do it.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.160
I agree.

22:45.160 --> 22:50.560
Speaking of big shocks, the last release of FreeNAS was a big shock, and the project made

22:50.560 --> 22:53.680
an about face and went back to version 9.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.960
And now FreeNAS 11 has been released.

22:55.960 --> 22:59.640
They've jumped right to FreeNAS 11, and it's based on FreeBSD 11, so it's nice to have

22:59.640 --> 23:01.200
those versions match up.

23:01.200 --> 23:05.320
Yeah, it's as if they've kind of said, well, let's just forget about 10 and move on to

23:05.320 --> 23:06.320
11.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.480
This looks like a hell of a release.

23:07.480 --> 23:11.680
It's introducing a new beta version of their administration GUI, so you have the new GUI

23:11.680 --> 23:14.920
and you have the old classic one, which is selectable at the login screen.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.320
It's based on some AngularJS magic.

23:17.320 --> 23:22.780
It looks great with live stats, but that's the least of the story here.

23:22.780 --> 23:24.560
I'm very impressed with what the team has done.

23:24.560 --> 23:25.560
It's really forward-looking.

23:25.560 --> 23:29.920
So I think a couple of the big headline features, though, are the new Alert Services page, which

23:29.920 --> 23:34.360
configures the systems to send critical alerts from FreeNAS to other applications like Slack

23:34.360 --> 23:38.400
or PagerDuty, AWS's mailing system, HipChat, et cetera.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.080
Mattermost is on the list.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.720
That is a forward-looking feature.

23:41.720 --> 23:46.160
I'm going to have to be characteristically negative here.

23:46.160 --> 23:51.960
So should it not just be doing one thing really well, Unix style?

23:51.960 --> 23:57.040
Should it not just be a really great network-attached storage distro?

23:57.040 --> 23:59.200
Does it really need to have all these other features?

23:59.200 --> 24:04.840
Well, they're standing on top of FreeBSD 11 release, which is using ZFS for the file system.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.240
So that stuff is pretty rock solid.

24:07.240 --> 24:12.560
That explains why when I went to download and install this, I noticed, hang on, it needs

24:12.560 --> 24:13.880
eight gigabytes of RAM.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.280
That's the kind of minimum spec for it.

24:16.280 --> 24:19.680
And so I thought, I'm not going to chuck this on an old box, and I'm definitely not chucking

24:19.680 --> 24:20.840
it on my main machine.

24:20.840 --> 24:25.280
Yeah, ZFS can use some RAM, especially if you have a lot of storage.

24:25.280 --> 24:28.160
It just seems overkill for my needs, at least.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.900
I think this is much more aimed at enterprise, isn't it?

24:30.900 --> 24:32.240
It's definitely getting there.

24:32.240 --> 24:36.800
In fact, one of the new features that I thought was really impressive is it can now emulate

24:36.800 --> 24:42.180
an S3 server, like an Amazon S3 distributed file system server.

24:42.180 --> 24:46.880
It's using the open-source Meno project, which provides S3 storage on FreeNAS, so you can

24:46.880 --> 24:52.960
then build your cloud, quote unquote, applications to talk S3, but communicate locally to your

24:52.960 --> 24:53.960
FreeNAS server.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.720
Oh, so that's going to potentially save you quite a lot of money then.

24:56.720 --> 24:57.920
I think that's the idea.

24:57.920 --> 25:02.140
And then you build for S3 in mind, you use it locally, and then if it comes time to publish

25:02.140 --> 25:05.300
it on AWS, you don't have to really refactor much of your code.

25:05.300 --> 25:08.100
Just sort of change the URLs and you're good to go.

25:08.100 --> 25:09.100
That's my assumption.

25:09.100 --> 25:11.680
Yeah, as I said, enterprise-level stuff, really.

25:11.680 --> 25:15.040
This is not the kind of thing that you're going to download, chuck on an old box and

25:15.040 --> 25:16.880
repurpose an old laptop.

25:16.880 --> 25:18.600
I think they're trying to do both.

25:18.600 --> 25:23.080
They're introducing features that make it easier to host things like Plex and other

25:23.080 --> 25:27.320
home user features, but they're also introducing features that make it nicer for developers

25:27.320 --> 25:29.800
and business deployments, which, why not?

25:29.800 --> 25:35.440
If you have a rock-solid BSD foundation and a rock-solid file system, you really have

25:35.440 --> 25:38.300
a lot of latitude there to build features on top of that.

25:38.300 --> 25:39.920
I think you might be right.

25:39.920 --> 25:43.000
It might begin to the point where it's too large, but then we have our friends over at

25:43.000 --> 25:44.720
Open Media Vault that have a new release.

25:44.720 --> 25:47.560
Yeah, why are we talking about a BSD thing on a Linux show?

25:47.560 --> 25:51.280
Let's talk about something that's for proper Linux based on Debian.

25:51.280 --> 25:56.080
So we've got this brand new release of Debian 9 and brand new release of Open Media Vault,

25:56.080 --> 25:59.000
Open Media Vault 3 based on Debian 8.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
Oh.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
Yeah.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.800
I think that whole transition to system D kind of took them by surprise.

26:03.800 --> 26:08.880
So they had to adapt their backend to system D, which required a complete refactoring of

26:08.880 --> 26:11.040
the backend of Open Media Vault, I believe.

26:11.040 --> 26:14.320
Now I tried to install this today, right?

26:14.320 --> 26:19.560
And you get through the NCurse's Debian installer and it gets to a point where it says you have

26:19.560 --> 26:20.600
to pick the disk.

26:20.600 --> 26:21.960
Now I didn't read it properly.

26:21.960 --> 26:27.320
It said it's going to use the whole disk, but it did also say that you will confirm

26:27.320 --> 26:28.720
at the next screen.

26:28.720 --> 26:32.720
So I selected the disk that I wanted, pressed enter, and then suddenly it's installing and

26:32.720 --> 26:34.200
destroyed all my partitions.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.200
I was like, no.

26:36.200 --> 26:38.560
Thankfully, that's what that machine is for.

26:38.560 --> 26:39.720
It's a test machine.

26:39.720 --> 26:46.920
And yeah, I lost my Solus and Kubuntu and a few other, I had a Zubuntu partition that

26:46.920 --> 26:52.040
I was using somewhat in production, but there was nothing there that wasn't backed up, put

26:52.040 --> 26:53.040
it that way.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.760
But it was still kind of annoying that that happened.

26:55.760 --> 27:00.160
And so then afterwards I was like, right, I'm not trying you out then.

27:00.160 --> 27:05.240
So I haven't actually tried this release out, but it looks like they've improved things,

27:05.240 --> 27:08.480
even if it is based on this ancient version of Debian now.

27:08.480 --> 27:12.080
Yeah, but these releases of Debian are supported, like I said, for five years.

27:12.080 --> 27:16.480
And the nice thing about this release is they've added support for extended FAT, which is going

27:16.480 --> 27:18.400
to make the next feature even better.

27:18.400 --> 27:22.160
They've also improved USB rotational storage device detection.

27:22.160 --> 27:25.880
I mentioned that because that's the very system I'm thinking of using for Angela's OpenMedia

27:25.880 --> 27:30.780
Vault to rotate a backup off site between buildings, and you can hook up devices and

27:30.780 --> 27:31.780
move them around.

27:31.780 --> 27:34.840
She's got an OpenMedia Vault 3 installation release candidate, so I've got to go over

27:34.840 --> 27:36.160
to her house and update that for her.

27:36.160 --> 27:37.840
You can't do it over SSH then.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.920
Joe, then I would have to open up ports.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.000
Come on, Joe.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.000
Come on.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.540
You know, I could consider doing something like that because they've enabled SSH by default

27:46.540 --> 27:48.440
in OpenMedia Vault 3.

27:48.440 --> 27:51.760
Yeah, which is a bit of a questionable decision.

27:51.760 --> 27:56.880
I know that the Raspberry Pi Foundation are being criticized for doing that on the Raspbian

27:56.880 --> 27:58.720
distro.

27:58.720 --> 28:04.040
It should be easily turn-on-able, if you know what I mean, but I'm a little bit hesitant

28:04.040 --> 28:06.280
to say it should be enabled by default.

28:06.280 --> 28:10.640
I tend to agree, especially because most users are oblivious to what it is, and those that

28:10.640 --> 28:13.640
know what it is probably know that they need to turn it on.

28:13.640 --> 28:15.600
Yeah, exactly.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.600
Yeah.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.880
Interestingly also, i386 has been dropped.

28:19.880 --> 28:26.360
So it's 64-bit only, which is a trend that we've seen all over, Arch, Tails.

28:26.360 --> 28:28.760
It's just the way of the future, isn't it?

28:28.760 --> 28:34.880
If you've got 32-bit only hardware, then it's getting increasingly difficult to find a distro

28:34.880 --> 28:39.720
to run on it, and eventually, they're just going to have to be thrown in the bin, unfortunately.

28:39.720 --> 28:42.400
Maybe you won't be able to put it on that old rig after all.

28:42.400 --> 28:49.320
Well, you can put it on an old rig, not an ancient one, because unless it's a netbook,

28:49.320 --> 28:51.980
how old has it got to be to be 32-bit?

28:51.980 --> 28:54.800
You're talking more than 10 years, aren't you?

28:54.800 --> 28:57.480
Probably 12, 13 years, maybe more.

28:57.480 --> 29:01.120
You know, Joe, my long years of experience have taught me not to go cheap on the systems

29:01.120 --> 29:02.560
I never want to have to futz with.

29:02.560 --> 29:07.440
So for Angela's setup, we put a NUC in there and then attached it to a hardware array of

29:07.440 --> 29:11.880
disks that have built-in RAID array, and then Open Media Vault just connects to that, and

29:11.880 --> 29:15.000
it's been just set it and forget it, and I don't have to mess with it because it's decent

29:15.000 --> 29:16.540
enough hardware that'll run for a while.

29:16.540 --> 29:21.280
There's really not many moving pieces in a NUC, and that storage array has redundancy.

29:21.280 --> 29:24.320
The nice thing is, is I don't have to really worry about a power supply going out for a

29:24.320 --> 29:25.320
long time.

29:25.320 --> 29:27.520
I don't have to worry about the video card dying or something like that.

29:27.520 --> 29:32.680
I say, if you can, put a slightly nicer machine in there so that way you don't have to futz

29:32.680 --> 29:33.680
with it.

29:33.680 --> 29:34.920
That's Chris's law of file servers.

29:34.920 --> 29:39.920
Yeah, but at the same time, you should have other backups anyway, and this is a great

29:39.920 --> 29:42.000
way to get into network storage.

29:42.000 --> 29:45.080
Fair enough, and why not take advantage of hardware you have to learn?

29:45.080 --> 29:46.080
I completely agree.

29:46.080 --> 29:49.520
I mean, when you get to a point where you're ready to put something in like an appliance,

29:49.520 --> 29:50.520
consider it.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.200
You just love buying new toys, don't you?

29:52.200 --> 29:55.280
That's what it boils down to.

29:55.280 --> 29:57.680
Speaking of new toys, get our show every single Monday.
