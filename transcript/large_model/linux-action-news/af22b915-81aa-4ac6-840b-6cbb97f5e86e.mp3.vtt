00:00.000 --> 00:15.880
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:15.880 --> 00:20.080
This is episode 79, recorded on November 11th, 2018.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.080
I'm Chris.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
And I'm Joe.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.080
Hello, Joe.

00:23.080 --> 00:26.880
It's good to be connected with you, and it's on a week where we have some upsets.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.800
We have some big wins and some surprises.

00:29.800 --> 00:35.320
Let's start with the controversy, and that is, can you or can you not boot Linux on these

00:35.320 --> 00:37.200
new Macs with the T2 chip?

00:37.200 --> 00:40.360
Well, the answer to that is, it's complicated.

00:40.360 --> 00:47.360
So this T2 chip is an ARM chip that is in the new MacBook Air and the new Mac Mini,

00:47.360 --> 00:51.440
and it's been in the iMac Pro for a while.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.480
And it controls a lot of stuff to do with security on these Macs.

00:54.480 --> 00:57.720
And one of the things that it controls is secure boot.

00:57.720 --> 01:04.880
And by default, it doesn't have the certificate to boot anything other than Mac OS or a bootcamp

01:04.880 --> 01:07.100
version of Windows 10.

01:07.100 --> 01:12.800
So you could say that they won't boot Linux, but you can turn that secure boot off, and

01:12.800 --> 01:15.200
then you can boot into Linux.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.200
Right.

01:16.200 --> 01:20.940
It's secure boot, but not quite as we know it, because by default, it ships and only

01:20.940 --> 01:22.240
Mac OS will ship.

01:22.240 --> 01:28.300
A verified version, a signed copy of Mac OS from Apple is the only operating system that

01:28.300 --> 01:29.840
will ship on this hardware.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.380
That's part of the security nature of it.

01:31.380 --> 01:36.120
So that way, you can't accidentally load a compromised version of Mac OS.

01:36.120 --> 01:41.040
You can turn that off, but like Joe said, it's not necessarily following secure boot

01:41.040 --> 01:42.040
as we know it.

01:42.040 --> 01:47.320
It doesn't have that famous Microsoft security certificate, but there is a signed version

01:47.320 --> 01:48.760
when you use bootcamp.

01:48.760 --> 01:54.280
Apple manages that certificate for you using the bootcamp assistant, and when it creates

01:54.280 --> 01:58.280
the installation media, it is impossible to boot Windows 10 on that hardware.

01:58.280 --> 02:03.480
But even if you have that certificate, it doesn't necessarily mean you have any drivers

02:03.480 --> 02:10.360
for the T2 chip, because the T2 chip not only does security, but it's also the SATA controller.

02:10.360 --> 02:16.480
And so that's why even if you disable secure boot, and then you can boot into Linux, try

02:16.480 --> 02:20.960
running Gparted or an installer, and it just simply doesn't see the internal SSD.

02:20.960 --> 02:26.240
You could install it to like a Thunderbolt device or USB drive or whatever, but you can't

02:26.240 --> 02:32.620
get it installed to the internal SSD of these new Macs, and that is what has annoyed a lot

02:32.620 --> 02:33.620
of people.

02:33.620 --> 02:38.680
Yeah, and I know breaking news here, the best system to run Linux isn't a Mac.

02:38.680 --> 02:40.440
Everybody sit down and take a deep breath.

02:40.440 --> 02:44.140
I know you're shocked by that, but I was having a conversation with a developer at Linux Academy

02:44.140 --> 02:46.960
who uses Fedora on a Mac Mini.

02:46.960 --> 02:50.480
And I was talking to him about it when the new Mac Mini came out, and he said, the old

02:50.480 --> 02:54.680
Mac Mini had been around for so long that those of us that wanted to use Linux on it

02:54.680 --> 02:57.940
had it really figured out, like you really knew all the ins and outs.

02:57.940 --> 03:02.520
And so it was actually a fairly viable Linux workstation that took up a small footprint,

03:02.520 --> 03:05.880
and if you needed Mac OS for some reason, you could dual boot into it.

03:05.880 --> 03:09.600
Sort of like people used to dual boot into Windows, well, there's a group of Linux users

03:09.600 --> 03:15.200
that want to dual boot into Mac OS, but this new Mac Mini doesn't provide that currently

03:15.200 --> 03:18.600
just simply because the driver support isn't there, and that's really the nature of the

03:18.600 --> 03:19.600
upset.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.800
But Chris's bit of advice would be just buy another piece of hardware, just get something

03:23.800 --> 03:26.640
else besides a Mac, and you don't have to fight with this.

03:26.640 --> 03:30.300
Not only are there vendors that make computers specifically born to run Linux, but there's

03:30.300 --> 03:34.680
also machines that are sold by a lot of known vendors that are very simple to get Linux

03:34.680 --> 03:37.920
running on it, and you can get to work instead of fight with the hardware.

03:37.920 --> 03:42.860
Maybe down the road, Apple will acknowledge this need by developers, and they'll create

03:42.860 --> 03:46.480
a signed version of the bootloader for Linux or something that the open source community

03:46.480 --> 03:47.540
can use.

03:47.540 --> 03:51.520
It's kind of confusing what they could actually do that could be scalable, but maybe there's

03:51.520 --> 03:52.920
some action they could take.

03:52.920 --> 03:56.400
But until Apple makes that effort, I wouldn't really vote with my wallet when it comes to

03:56.400 --> 03:57.400
Apple hardware.

03:57.400 --> 03:58.400
Personal opinion.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.680
Well, I've got a confession to make.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.840
I own two Macs.

04:02.840 --> 04:06.740
The audience are probably not going to believe that, but don't worry, they're Core 2 duos.

04:06.740 --> 04:11.200
One of them was given to me by Alan Pope on iMac, which has got a lovely screen, lovely

04:11.200 --> 04:18.480
speakers, and I've also got an old MacBook Pro, the big 17-inch aluminum one.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.480
The lunch tray.

04:19.480 --> 04:24.840
Yeah, and that has got amazing speakers for a laptop, and that's what I use it for, media

04:24.840 --> 04:25.840
consumption.

04:25.840 --> 04:28.100
Now, the thing is, those two have both been abandoned by Apple.

04:28.100 --> 04:31.440
They're not getting any more security updates on the old version of Mac OS that they're

04:31.440 --> 04:32.440
running.

04:32.440 --> 04:36.960
I think, actually, the laptop's actually an OS 10 Lion, I think that was before Mac OS.

04:36.960 --> 04:40.920
Anyway, that is the angle that I'm looking at this from.

04:40.920 --> 04:44.400
Right now, you would say, obviously, don't buy a Mac if you want to run Linux on it.

04:44.400 --> 04:48.480
There's buy a Dell or entry-ware system 76, whatever.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.920
But we're talking down the line here.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.440
The used market, the hand-me-down scenario.

04:53.440 --> 04:55.580
Yeah, exactly.

04:55.580 --> 04:59.600
And so that's where this is a problem for me.

04:59.600 --> 05:05.240
If you can't install Linux on it now, then you might not be able to once it's been abandoned,

05:05.240 --> 05:07.880
and it's not going to be supported for that long.

05:07.880 --> 05:11.100
And this is very expensive hardware that is really good.

05:11.100 --> 05:12.880
You can say whatever you want about Apple.

05:12.880 --> 05:17.600
Their hardware is generally really good, and actually lasts quite a long time.

05:17.600 --> 05:22.600
And the Core 2 Duo machines that I've got are working absolutely fine running GNU slash

05:22.600 --> 05:23.600
Linux.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.800
You know, proper, good, old-fashioned Linux.

05:25.800 --> 05:31.280
And I say old-fashioned, they'll run the very latest kernel and all the security stuff.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.160
You know, everything's fine with them.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.860
Still getting plenty of life out of those old machines.

05:35.860 --> 05:41.660
But don't you think by the time this new Mac Mini or MacBook Air gets to that hand-me-down

05:41.660 --> 05:46.360
scenario point that perhaps the open source community will have come up with something?

05:46.360 --> 05:49.520
Or is this T2 chip the big change here?

05:49.520 --> 05:52.560
Because this is a custom Apple piece of kit here.

05:52.560 --> 05:59.000
It's essentially an iOS device in a Mac using an ARM CPU with their A-series system on a

05:59.000 --> 06:04.800
chip that even has the secure enclave, and that's doing the SATA management.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.360
How could we ever have any potential of writing drivers for it?

06:07.360 --> 06:10.080
I mean, does this T2 change the game, you think?

06:10.080 --> 06:12.440
Maybe the hand-me-down scenario is gone now?

06:12.440 --> 06:14.060
That's what I'm worried about.

06:14.060 --> 06:16.360
But then never underestimate the open source community.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.360
They are very clever people.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.360
Right.

06:19.360 --> 06:20.360
That's very true.

06:20.360 --> 06:21.360
Yeah.

06:21.360 --> 06:26.120
The only way it's likely to ever happen, in a weird ironic sense, is if this machine turns

06:26.120 --> 06:29.640
out to be a success and a tunner on the market.

06:29.640 --> 06:34.640
Which is, in a weird way, voting against making them compatible with Linux, even though that

06:34.640 --> 06:37.880
is the very thing that drives their Linux compatibility.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.280
That's an odd one.

06:39.280 --> 06:42.880
Maybe we should just stay in the odd territory and let's talk about Microsoft and Linux,

06:42.880 --> 06:44.960
which for some of us can still feel a bit odd.

06:44.960 --> 06:45.960
Yeah.

06:45.960 --> 06:50.200
So the Windows subsystem for Linux has received some new features in the Windows 10 October

06:50.200 --> 06:56.520
2018 update, including one feature that I use in XFC all the time.

06:56.520 --> 07:01.720
I have right-click, open terminal here, and they've got it in Windows 10 now, open Linux

07:01.720 --> 07:02.720
shell here.

07:02.720 --> 07:03.720
In Explorer?

07:03.720 --> 07:04.720
In Explorer?

07:04.720 --> 07:05.720
Yeah.

07:05.720 --> 07:06.720
Wow.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.720
You can open a bash shell from Explorer now.

07:09.720 --> 07:13.440
That's almost as big as a notepad now supporting Linux line endings.

07:13.440 --> 07:16.080
Those two things right there are huge.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.080
Yeah.

07:17.080 --> 07:22.040
Back in the day, though, back in the day, when I was working on Linux and Windows systems

07:22.040 --> 07:26.600
a lot, like Linux Samba servers that Windows systems were connecting to, and I tried to

07:26.600 --> 07:31.200
open up a config file or a bash script in Notepad, it was a mess.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.200
Yeah.

07:32.200 --> 07:36.060
And then you go into Word wrap, and that's not working, and why isn't it?

07:36.060 --> 07:38.920
So now that's going to be fixed, which is good, I suppose.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.020
I mean, is all this good?

07:41.020 --> 07:43.040
That's the question that I always ask here.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.920
And a copy-paste support as well, which has got a lot better.

07:45.920 --> 07:46.920
Right.

07:46.920 --> 07:50.360
And then number two, even kind of outside of the Linux subsystem but kind of still in

07:50.360 --> 07:53.800
the same category, is support for Chocolaty.

07:53.800 --> 07:58.920
Now Chocolaty is sort of like brew for Mac OS or app for Debian.

07:58.920 --> 08:04.100
And this was something I discovered when I did a Windows 10, live in Windows 10 week

08:04.100 --> 08:09.200
challenge for Coda Radio like almost a year ago, and I just couldn't get anywhere without

08:09.200 --> 08:10.200
a package manager.

08:10.200 --> 08:13.440
I have really come to use a package manager as part of my workflow.

08:13.440 --> 08:16.360
I want something, it's just an apt away.

08:16.360 --> 08:21.280
And this is what Chocolaty brings to Windows 10, and Microsoft has teamed up with that

08:21.280 --> 08:26.380
community and the box starter config tool to make it easier to automate those setups

08:26.380 --> 08:30.700
and deployments of Windows machines that already have Chocolaty installed and ready to go up

08:30.700 --> 08:32.160
to date.

08:32.160 --> 08:35.360
That's pretty great because then if you're creating a standardized image for your IT

08:35.360 --> 08:38.000
department, you can now just include Chocolaty as part of that.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.560
Well, you say it's great, and I ask the question again, is this all good?

08:41.560 --> 08:45.660
The better the subsystem gets, the less reason there is to use proper Linux.

08:45.660 --> 08:50.760
It's still not proper Linux though, and the closer and closer they get, the more tantalizing

08:50.760 --> 08:55.200
it is to just to get proper Linux because you get in that uncanny valley that's more

08:55.200 --> 08:57.000
frustrating than anything else.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.520
When it's the command prompt on Windows and you have tools like ping and DIR, it's like,

09:01.520 --> 09:04.540
oh, it's kind of like bash, this is adorable.

09:04.540 --> 09:08.800
But when you get really close but you still can't have it all, I think that's going to

09:08.800 --> 09:13.840
encourage more people to try out desktop Linux than anything that Microsoft has done previously.

09:13.840 --> 09:21.160
I look back at this whole history now of Windows subsystem and the open sourcing of.NET Core

09:21.160 --> 09:26.840
and all of that that has sort of accumulated to what we have today, and that seems to be

09:26.840 --> 09:29.320
that Linux is doing better than ever.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.860
All this has done is just drove more Linux users.

09:31.860 --> 09:36.760
It seems to have slowed Linux down in the least, and I imagine it'll just continue.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.960
It's such a glass half full, man, aren't you?

09:38.960 --> 09:43.560
No doubt you'll see the same thing here then, that Samsung have clarified what's going on

09:43.560 --> 09:45.640
with this Linux on decks situation.

09:45.640 --> 09:51.840
Oh, I wish I could be, but I watched the video and they really kind of disappoint in this

09:51.840 --> 09:52.840
video.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.680
So the idea is so beautiful.

09:54.680 --> 10:01.360
It goes back to convergence that we all dreamed of when Canonical set off on that great journey

10:01.360 --> 10:02.840
one year.

10:02.840 --> 10:06.740
And now fast forward to 2018 and the idea is back and this time it's being proposed

10:06.740 --> 10:09.720
by Samsung, but this time it's a little different.

10:09.720 --> 10:14.000
It's using a desktop environment that you can get installed on the Samsung phone that

10:14.000 --> 10:18.940
you can then launch the Linux environment from, which runs out of a container and is

10:18.940 --> 10:21.320
based on Ubuntu 16.04 as of right now.

10:21.320 --> 10:25.120
Well, Ubuntu 16.04 is a solid Linux distro, isn't it?

10:25.120 --> 10:26.120
Yep.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.040
I mean, 18.04 would be nice and apparently they're working on that, but for now I'd take

10:29.040 --> 10:30.460
16.04, no problem.

10:30.460 --> 10:34.400
And if this is possible, it may be possible for the community to create their own install

10:34.400 --> 10:38.080
of 18.04 or even another distribution of Linux altogether.

10:38.080 --> 10:40.600
That's not what concerns me.

10:40.600 --> 10:45.320
What concerns me, and bear in mind it is early days, but what concerns me is the video they

10:45.320 --> 10:50.900
released is clearly doctored to make the system seem more performant.

10:50.900 --> 10:55.320
And the mistake that they made was they have the seconds indicator on in their desktop

10:55.320 --> 10:58.840
clock and so you can just see where they sped the video up because the counter just starts

10:58.840 --> 11:04.600
flying and it's done when applications are loading or large complex things are loading

11:04.600 --> 11:09.440
and they speed up the time of the video to make it seem like the device is faster.

11:09.440 --> 11:14.440
And the concern I have is even with the video sped up, it seems barely fast enough.

11:14.440 --> 11:18.840
What people speeding up videos to try and make a point, that wouldn't happen this week,

11:18.840 --> 11:19.840
would it?

11:19.840 --> 11:20.840
No, no.

11:20.840 --> 11:27.360
But I spoke to some people at Canonical who actually saw this in the flesh this week and

11:27.360 --> 11:30.400
they said it was actually really fast and they were really impressed with it.

11:30.400 --> 11:35.160
So I don't know if that video is maybe an earlier build of it or something because apparently

11:35.160 --> 11:36.600
this is really, really good.

11:36.600 --> 11:40.360
I've not seen it firsthand, but I trust the people who've told me this.

11:40.360 --> 11:45.100
Well, remember we were talking about this since the initial demo in 2017.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.360
So this is something they must have been working on for a while.

11:47.360 --> 11:53.200
So you would hope that if they've been sitting on it, it has been to refine it and it absolutely

11:53.200 --> 11:57.080
seems like one of those you'd have to see it to really judge it and everybody has a

11:57.080 --> 12:00.880
different threshold for what speed means to them.

12:00.880 --> 12:06.880
However, if this thing could get you a basic desktop web browser that supported like extensions

12:06.880 --> 12:11.440
and all of the things that I come to expect from say a full Chrome or a full Firefox,

12:11.440 --> 12:16.600
and I could easily get to a terminal and a few of my other favorite Linux apps, it doesn't

12:16.600 --> 12:21.600
have to be a speed demon because those are SOS type situations where I'm plugging my

12:21.600 --> 12:26.560
phone in and I am saving the situation by having access via my phone.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.840
They pitch it as a tool for developers to create applications.

12:29.840 --> 12:33.120
I can't help but see it as a sysadmin's lifeboat.

12:33.120 --> 12:37.080
Like this is where you bring your emergency tool set, you can plug this thing in and get

12:37.080 --> 12:39.980
access and bring your infrastructure back up online.

12:39.980 --> 12:44.600
And if it's slightly slower than your Core i7 laptop, that's okay.

12:44.600 --> 12:49.080
What really impressed me though was the Galaxy Tab S4 because this is the Note 9 and the

12:49.080 --> 12:50.080
Tab S4.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.080
Right.

12:51.080 --> 12:54.600
The Note 9 needs an external screen, but the Galaxy Tab S4 doesn't.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.600
Good point.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.360
And it's on the tablet screen itself.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.720
So it becomes a standalone device at that point.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.360
Now that is pretty cool.

13:02.360 --> 13:07.240
I was really kind of thinking it more from the phone angle in the pocket.

13:07.240 --> 13:10.080
But you know, that actually sounds pretty good since the screen's built in.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.880
I hadn't really given that much thought.

13:11.880 --> 13:14.300
I wonder how that will perform.

13:14.300 --> 13:18.360
It's almost, almost makes me want to grab one just to try it, Joe.

13:18.360 --> 13:21.720
You know, like when you see that kind of stuff, you're like, is this going to be a flop?

13:21.720 --> 13:23.040
Is this really possible?

13:23.040 --> 13:25.560
You don't know until you use it.

13:25.560 --> 13:29.240
Maybe I'll get lucky and have an opportunity to put my hands on it because it is, it is

13:29.240 --> 13:30.240
tempting.

13:30.240 --> 13:35.120
We have wanted this for a very long time and it could be an iPad Pro killer for some people.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.120
Yeah.

13:36.120 --> 13:40.120
Well, I may or may not have been looking on eBay today, but no, too much I'm afraid.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.120
Are they?

13:41.120 --> 13:42.120
I'm spending 500 quid on it.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.120
Plus.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.120
Yeah.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.120
That doesn't surprise me.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.120
Yeah.

13:46.120 --> 13:50.000
Well, you know, I'll keep an eye on it and if the opportunity comes up, I will get my

13:50.000 --> 13:51.000
hands on it.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.280
Maybe I can get a review unit one of these days too because I'd love to try it because

13:54.280 --> 13:55.600
it could be great.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.640
It really could be great.

13:56.640 --> 14:00.060
And then you also have the advantage of having an Android tablet if you'd like to have things

14:00.060 --> 14:03.960
like Netflix and some of the other streaming apps or commercial applications that are easily

14:03.960 --> 14:05.120
available via the Play Store.

14:05.120 --> 14:08.120
So there's a nice balance there potentially.

14:08.120 --> 14:13.200
What I'm really, really hoping is that some enterprising people will port this to other

14:13.200 --> 14:16.160
Android devices and it won't just be these two Samsung ones.

14:16.160 --> 14:22.360
I don't know how realistic that is, but again, I have a lot of faith in this hacking community,

14:22.360 --> 14:24.520
especially the Android community.

14:24.520 --> 14:30.360
Do you remember the very early stages of Canonical's phone effort was essentially getting Ubuntu

14:30.360 --> 14:32.160
running on top of an Android layer?

14:32.160 --> 14:34.240
Yeah, which I think they should have stuck with.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.640
That's what I was just going to say that.

14:36.640 --> 14:43.240
Imagine for a moment if a hardware neutral vendor had created a really fast layer that

14:43.240 --> 14:47.720
ran on top of Android and maybe back then the technology wasn't there because you maybe

14:47.720 --> 14:50.360
didn't have kernels new enough to support containers.

14:50.360 --> 14:54.480
And now instead of running it in a virtual environment, which is much more overhead,

14:54.480 --> 14:58.560
you can run it in a container, which is much more minimal and requires a lot less hardware,

14:58.560 --> 15:01.080
which means it's going to work a lot better on a mobile device.

15:01.080 --> 15:04.960
So maybe the tech just wasn't quite there yet, at least in widespread adoption.

15:04.960 --> 15:05.960
But you're right, Joe.

15:05.960 --> 15:09.760
What would make me probably 100 times more excited about this is if this was an open

15:09.760 --> 15:13.880
source project we were talking about that was going to be available for the Pixel phones,

15:13.880 --> 15:17.700
it was going to be available for the OnePlus phones, et cetera, et cetera.

15:17.700 --> 15:21.960
It being limited to Samsung devices honestly makes it less compelling to me because Samsung

15:21.960 --> 15:24.760
devices are not particularly compelling to me.

15:24.760 --> 15:27.160
I just don't like the Samsung software.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.420
I think BigSpeak can die in a fire.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.680
Those kinds of things make them non-compelling devices for me.

15:31.680 --> 15:36.000
So even though they're doing this, I'm just not super inclined to pick one up.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.560
The tablet might be the only kind of exception to that because that's kind of neat that it's

15:41.560 --> 15:42.620
on the same screen.

15:42.620 --> 15:46.200
But you know, I'm following, like if this was a project that was widely deployable on

15:46.200 --> 15:48.640
general hardware, 100 times more exciting.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.440
Well, that was kind of promised by MaruOS.

15:51.440 --> 15:53.360
And I remember being very excited about that.

15:53.360 --> 15:59.680
That was Debian with XFCE in a container running on top of Android on a couple of Nexus devices.

15:59.680 --> 16:02.720
But I haven't heard anything for months about that.

16:02.720 --> 16:06.440
And I looked into it and yeah, there's not been any new releases for months and months

16:06.440 --> 16:12.360
and months on that one, which is a real shame because I thought that had real promise.

16:12.360 --> 16:16.440
But having Samsung and their proprietary stranglehold on it, this was all open source.

16:16.440 --> 16:22.360
So I really hope that MaruOS springs back into life soon, maybe inspired by this.

16:22.360 --> 16:25.360
But until then, I suppose we'll have to rely on Samsung.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.360
Yeah.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.360
I guess I couldn't have said it better myself.

16:27.360 --> 16:31.800
Well, how about something that's available to just about every Android user that's on

16:31.800 --> 16:32.800
Linux?

16:32.800 --> 16:34.300
And that's two pieces of software.

16:34.300 --> 16:39.400
Let's start with KDE Connect, which has a brand new fancy version, both for the desktop,

16:39.400 --> 16:40.840
but their Android app as well.

16:40.840 --> 16:44.800
Yeah, the very best thing about using the Plasma desktop as far as I'm concerned is

16:44.800 --> 16:45.800
KDE Connect.

16:45.800 --> 16:51.320
I'd say it's like 10 things about the Plasma desktop, but this is in the top five for sure.

16:51.320 --> 16:56.520
It really kind of bridges the gap and is a type of convergence that is just about enough

16:56.520 --> 16:57.520
for me.

16:57.520 --> 17:02.200
And it allows me to manage the notifications from both devices, control playback, even

17:02.200 --> 17:06.360
share the clipboard, which is one of the most functional capabilities that I find.

17:06.360 --> 17:10.720
And in a pinch, I'll also use my phone as a remote mouse.

17:10.720 --> 17:15.660
And maybe the best thing about KDE Connect is how simple it is to set up.

17:15.660 --> 17:19.840
You install the app on your phone, you go to KDE Connect settings in the system settings,

17:19.840 --> 17:24.360
you enter the pin code in, and they're talking over Wi-Fi over a secure channel.

17:24.360 --> 17:25.860
It's pretty brilliant.

17:25.860 --> 17:31.580
And they're upping their game with this next release, and they are dropping support for

17:31.580 --> 17:38.800
older versions, 4.0 and older of Android, to gain some functionality, to gain some security.

17:38.800 --> 17:42.820
And it does mean sort of closing the door on about 400 users of the software.

17:42.820 --> 17:47.400
But that's the kind of decision that projects like this need to make from time to time.

17:47.400 --> 17:51.920
And they based it on data, and I think it's a fair one for the wider user base.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.800
Yeah, it is a shame.

17:53.800 --> 17:59.920
But in order to target Android 8 and above in the Play Store, they had to make this decision.

17:59.920 --> 18:03.760
And I was kind of wrestling with it myself, whether it was a good idea.

18:03.760 --> 18:05.800
And they could just go F-Droid only.

18:05.800 --> 18:09.880
But realistically, if they want to get this into the hands of as many users as possible,

18:09.880 --> 18:12.600
it has to be in the Play Store as well as F-Droid.

18:12.600 --> 18:16.040
And therefore, they have to play by the Play Store rules.

18:16.040 --> 18:22.800
And 400 people is not insignificant, but they have to just use the data, as you say, and

18:22.800 --> 18:23.800
make the decision.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.920
So it's a shame that they had to do it, but I think they did have to do it.

18:26.920 --> 18:31.000
One of the new features is the run command now supports triggering commands using the

18:31.000 --> 18:38.080
KDE Connect URL syntax, which is really useful for integration, say, with NFC tags around

18:38.080 --> 18:39.080
your place.

18:39.080 --> 18:43.960
So maybe in your office, you could have an area where your phone registers an NFC tag,

18:43.960 --> 18:46.960
and then it triggers an action on your computer.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.820
That could be some cool ways to automate things that don't require any cloud integration or

18:50.820 --> 18:51.820
anything like that.

18:51.820 --> 18:54.900
Your two boxes on the same LAN, triggering action based on tags.

18:54.900 --> 18:59.240
You could have, say, an NFC tag by your bed if your computer's in the room that you sleep

18:59.240 --> 19:03.200
in, when you trigger that, it could put the monitors to sleep.

19:03.200 --> 19:07.680
And there's a lot of ways you can actually kick off scripts in KDE using that URL structure.

19:07.680 --> 19:12.080
So I would have to try around and build something, but it really has my mind churning on the

19:12.080 --> 19:13.080
possibilities.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.200
That's going to be a great feature.

19:14.200 --> 19:19.040
Well, the biggest feature for me is you can now send files to Pantheon files.

19:19.040 --> 19:22.080
I'm not really interested in that, but you can send them to Thunar.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.080
Yes.

19:23.080 --> 19:26.800
And you know, really, the GNOME users aren't left out.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.640
There is also GS Connect, which saw a new release.

19:29.640 --> 19:34.480
Yeah, and this is using the KDE Connect app on the phone, but it's using a GTK front end

19:34.480 --> 19:38.240
on the computer, so it's properly integrated with GNOME.

19:38.240 --> 19:42.500
And with this new release, they rewrote it to better conform to GNOME's design guidelines.

19:42.500 --> 19:48.120
So it looks nice, it works good in high DPI, and supports accessibility features now too.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.420
But isn't this the beauty of open source that you can have one app on the phone that works

19:51.420 --> 19:52.420
for both of them?

19:52.420 --> 19:54.720
You know, you wouldn't get that with Samsung, would you?

19:54.720 --> 19:56.680
Yeah, really back to the Samsung point, right?

19:56.680 --> 20:01.660
This is why this is a way more exciting project, is it's universally available to all of us,

20:01.660 --> 20:06.160
and there's even availability for people that don't use the KDE desktop.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.780
Or you Fedora users, you just got a treat in this new release.

20:08.780 --> 20:13.120
There's improvements to package kit support, especially for Fedora users, which was a fix

20:13.120 --> 20:16.180
that was submitted by a single contributor to the project.

20:16.180 --> 20:17.840
And now it's rolled up in here.

20:17.840 --> 20:22.760
And that kind of stuff is, to me, a lot more exciting than, say, the Samsung DeX.

20:22.760 --> 20:27.560
I do kind of want to see both work, though, so there's room for both.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.360
And I may end up being a user of both one day.

20:30.360 --> 20:35.080
But it's nice to see both GS Connect and KDE Connect getting these updates.

20:35.080 --> 20:38.840
One of the cooler projects out there for desktop integration, at least for the phones that

20:38.840 --> 20:39.840
we have today.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.720
But what about the phones that we're going to have tomorrow, or will that be the next

20:42.720 --> 20:43.720
day?

20:43.720 --> 20:44.720
Or will it be next week or next year?

20:44.720 --> 20:47.840
Who knows with the Librem 5, eh?

20:47.840 --> 20:49.480
Yes, we have an update.

20:49.480 --> 20:53.200
And you know they're trying to set a tone in the post when they start by running down

20:53.200 --> 20:56.240
the recent hurricanes and typhoons that have delayed production?

20:56.240 --> 20:59.680
So they're kind of setting the table here.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.640
And it looks like things are slightly behind schedule.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.680
Now, they have verified a lot of the individual hardware components.

21:05.680 --> 21:08.000
There's still some that are missing.

21:08.000 --> 21:14.760
But as we record right now, Pureism CTO Nicole Ferber writes that she's a little reluctant

21:14.760 --> 21:19.720
to commit exactly on timetables.

21:19.720 --> 21:24.400
What she does know at this point is the PCB fabrication here in the USA will take 11 business

21:24.400 --> 21:25.400
days.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.640
They have to make 300 of those boards, which are complex.

21:28.640 --> 21:34.400
And there's 160 different parts and more than 500 components in total per board.

21:34.400 --> 21:38.080
And that just means it takes some time, even with the amazing machines they have to put

21:38.080 --> 21:39.860
them all together.

21:39.860 --> 21:43.180
And that's the minimum driver of the timetable.

21:43.180 --> 21:44.180
Then you have the testing.

21:44.180 --> 21:47.680
They'll probably take another week or so until they can give the green light for PCB fabrication

21:47.680 --> 21:52.360
to fully begin and complete production, about two weeks for them to then be built, and another

21:52.360 --> 21:57.340
week for production, then assembly, and then testing, and then shipping.

21:57.340 --> 21:59.200
And that puts it right into the holidays.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.380
So there's a lot of moving parts.

22:01.380 --> 22:06.080
But their best, best, bestest effort is to try to get all of the backers, their new toys,

22:06.080 --> 22:07.600
before the end of the year.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.440
Yeah, this is just the development kits, though.

22:09.440 --> 22:13.280
This isn't the final thing, which they'd originally promised first quarter.

22:13.280 --> 22:15.840
I think they'd even said January of 2019.

22:15.840 --> 22:17.680
So it has slipped massively.

22:17.680 --> 22:20.160
They'd originally planned to ship these development kits in the summer.

22:20.160 --> 22:24.040
So they're, what, basically five, six months behind.

22:24.040 --> 22:27.720
And this got me thinking, you've done contracting before.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.520
I've done contracting before.

22:29.520 --> 22:34.400
And one trick that I learned very early on was to always tell the client that it was

22:34.400 --> 22:37.320
going to take about twice as long as you thought it was going to take.

22:37.320 --> 22:43.240
And then if it takes a little bit longer than you thought, then they're happy with it.

22:43.240 --> 22:47.160
And maybe they should have been a bit more pessimistic here, because I can't help but

22:47.160 --> 22:51.520
feel that they went for the very best case scenario with every stage.

22:51.520 --> 22:54.200
And that was January 2019.

22:54.200 --> 23:00.120
Whereas in reality, the way this has slipped, it's probably going to be like Q4 2019.

23:00.120 --> 23:01.120
I think it's safe to say.

23:01.120 --> 23:06.080
And if they'd said end of 2019, and then somehow managed to do it in like spring, everyone

23:06.080 --> 23:08.140
would have been over the moon with it.

23:08.140 --> 23:12.580
This is the idealism that we've all been kind of sniffing from the beginning, saying, boy,

23:12.580 --> 23:16.380
that seems a little ambitious, boy, that seems a little, that right there seems like it's

23:16.380 --> 23:17.520
really pushing it.

23:17.520 --> 23:21.520
That's been the commentary about this entire thing since the very beginning.

23:21.520 --> 23:25.500
And that is the dichotomy of purism at its core.

23:25.500 --> 23:31.480
In order to be audacious enough to think that you could bend the PC industry into opening

23:31.480 --> 23:37.280
up the hardware around the Intel chip, or that you could take on Android and iOS and

23:37.280 --> 23:42.600
make a dent in the market and sell phones with physical switches to turn off hardware

23:42.600 --> 23:46.840
components, and even think that there's consumers that could grok that advantage, is audacious

23:46.840 --> 23:48.160
in its thinking.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.100
It's very optimistic in its thinking.

23:51.100 --> 23:56.240
And you almost have to have people willing to think that way for anybody to ever try

23:56.240 --> 24:00.100
something new, because nothing would ever change otherwise.

24:00.100 --> 24:05.360
But then at the same time, those people are not very good at fully actuating all of the

24:05.360 --> 24:06.840
potential negatives.

24:06.840 --> 24:10.700
They need pessimists on their team that they listen to that sit there and go, well, that's

24:10.700 --> 24:11.700
not a good idea.

24:11.700 --> 24:12.700
That won't work.

24:12.700 --> 24:15.160
And then they have to they have to have like an engaging back and forth.

24:15.160 --> 24:18.800
And if the whole company is being run by a top down approach where it's idealism at the

24:18.800 --> 24:22.460
top down, these are sort of the things that end up happening.

24:22.460 --> 24:27.680
And so backers are just sort of left trying to guess these dynamics when they back it.

24:27.680 --> 24:30.240
And then you sit back and just watch how the project unfolds.

24:30.240 --> 24:33.640
Yeah, I was gonna say they could hire me if they wanted a bit of pessimism, but I'm a

24:33.640 --> 24:34.640
bit busy these days.

24:34.640 --> 24:38.520
Well, you know, Joe, you do give them this for free.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.400
So there's always that.

24:40.400 --> 24:44.600
This is consulting time with Joe and Peerism.

24:44.600 --> 24:48.760
They have some subsystems left to validate as well, I should just point out like Bluetooth

24:48.760 --> 24:54.880
camera, the wireless controller, the touch controller, the USB roll switching.

24:54.880 --> 24:59.880
There's some major things they have validated the microphone, the Ethernet, the audio codec,

24:59.880 --> 25:05.280
the charge controller, general USB compatibility, but there's still some fundamentals that they're

25:05.280 --> 25:06.680
working with.

25:06.680 --> 25:10.720
And they still have to forward port drivers because remember, they're working with hardware

25:10.720 --> 25:13.760
that doesn't necessarily have the drivers that they're using in the current kernel that

25:13.760 --> 25:14.760
they're using.

25:14.760 --> 25:19.240
So there's a lot at play here besides just the manufacturing of the dev kits.

25:19.240 --> 25:21.320
Yeah, there's so many moving parts here.

25:21.320 --> 25:25.720
And who knew that making a phone, especially a phone that was trying to be as free as it

25:25.720 --> 25:28.560
possibly could be, would be difficult.

25:28.560 --> 25:33.160
Well, I think we told them that, didn't we, a year ago when we first heard about this.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.760
It's like they're not attending our consulting meetings, Joe.

25:35.760 --> 25:36.760
Yeah.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.960
Why are we giving them all this advice for free?

25:38.960 --> 25:43.000
All right, well, let's end on a bit of bad news.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.560
And a sort of retrospective really, and that is that Nexus devices are finally dead.

25:47.560 --> 25:54.840
The 5X and the 6P have received what's pretty much going to be their last OTA and their

25:54.840 --> 25:56.040
last security update.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.040
And so that's it.

25:57.040 --> 26:00.040
That's kind of the end of the Nexus devices as we know it.

26:00.040 --> 26:04.560
Obviously they'll live on with custom ROMs, but official ROMs wise, that's it.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.920
It's Pixel or nothing now.

26:06.920 --> 26:13.520
Yeah, I am both a bit sad to see it go because I liked the idea of the Nexus line create

26:13.520 --> 26:18.840
a Google reference device that was in a price range that mortals could afford, that developers

26:18.840 --> 26:21.040
could buy to try building apps.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.480
And it did serve that purpose for a while.

26:23.480 --> 26:28.800
However, I've recently become the owner of a Pixel 3, the smaller one, and quote unquote

26:28.800 --> 26:29.800
smaller.

26:29.800 --> 26:36.720
And it's a fine phone with an incredible camera and a great size, good screen, nice performance.

26:36.720 --> 26:41.740
It's really by far the best Android device I've ever used.

26:41.740 --> 26:46.760
And if that's the trade-off they had to take to get Android to that level, maybe it's worth

26:46.760 --> 26:49.000
it for most consumers.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.660
I miss my Nexus 6P.

26:50.660 --> 26:53.000
That's one of the reasons I got the Pixel 3 is because I knew this was coming.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.240
I rode that 6P all the way to the end and it served me well.

26:57.240 --> 27:01.480
But the Pixel 3 is in every measurable way a better phone.

27:01.480 --> 27:04.240
Well, that's because it's targeted at consumers, isn't it?

27:04.240 --> 27:11.520
Whereas the Nexus devices were targeted at developers and enthusiasts and power users.

27:11.520 --> 27:16.740
Whereas the idea, at least with the Pixel, is that it's going to be sold to the masses.

27:16.740 --> 27:20.840
Whether or not they're delivering on the numbers that they hoped they would, I don't know.

27:20.840 --> 27:24.800
With three generations in now, Google's got a lot of money to burn on this.

27:24.800 --> 27:28.480
So we'll see if this actually pans out long term.

27:28.480 --> 27:32.480
Yeah, I doubt it's selling in big numbers, although I think it's selling through Verizon

27:32.480 --> 27:33.640
now.

27:33.640 --> 27:34.960
I kind of see a different take.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.920
I mean, we don't have to make this about the Pixel.

27:36.920 --> 27:41.400
But just a quick aside, I see it more as an Android phone for iPhone potential users because

27:41.400 --> 27:42.920
it's sort of all neat and tidy.

27:42.920 --> 27:44.000
It's taken care of.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.120
It feels like an ecosystem.

27:45.120 --> 27:48.240
There's Pixel buds and there's Pixel chargers.

27:48.240 --> 27:51.720
But what the Pixel is really good at is just bringing in all the Google services.

27:51.720 --> 27:56.000
So if you're in Google apps for your work, if you've got Google email and you've got

27:56.000 --> 28:01.760
Google Calendar and Contacts and things like that, the Pixel is really a showcase for Google

28:01.760 --> 28:02.760
services.

28:02.760 --> 28:05.480
And that's what its biggest strength is.

28:05.480 --> 28:10.600
And the Nexus line didn't quite get there, didn't quite close the gap.

28:10.600 --> 28:14.840
Going forward, this just means that your Nexus device will keep working as it is, but you

28:14.840 --> 28:20.360
won't be getting any kind of security updates or critical vulnerabilities of any kind fixed

28:20.360 --> 28:22.160
from Google directly.

28:22.160 --> 28:27.960
However, there are often community ROMs out there that will extend the life of your phone

28:27.960 --> 28:30.200
for a couple of more years at least.

28:30.200 --> 28:33.560
So this is a great opportunity now that Google is no longer supporting you.

28:33.560 --> 28:40.560
If you still think your Nexus 5X or 6P is a viable device, this is a great time.

28:40.560 --> 28:43.680
This is the perfect time to jump into the ROM community.

28:43.680 --> 28:47.840
Get slow and learn and get more life out of your phone, just like Joe's getting more life

28:47.840 --> 28:49.520
out of those old Macs.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.520
Yeah.

28:50.520 --> 28:51.520
Yeah.

28:51.520 --> 28:56.480
My advice to you with your 6P is download.lineage.org slash angler.

28:56.480 --> 29:03.020
And you can have a ROM today as people listening to this brand new nightly that will be totally

29:03.020 --> 29:05.560
up to date with security updates and everything.

29:05.560 --> 29:06.640
Nice.

29:06.640 --> 29:12.440
And so it'll be, as you say, a year or two probably before it gets abandoned by lineage.

29:12.440 --> 29:15.720
And by that point, the battery will be totally shot and you'll probably dropped it and stuff.

29:15.720 --> 29:22.240
But I mean, even my Nexus 4 is getting security updates even now and that phone is years and

29:22.240 --> 29:23.240
years old.

29:23.240 --> 29:25.560
So it might even be more than a couple of years from now.

29:25.560 --> 29:26.560
Yeah.

29:26.560 --> 29:27.560
This is, like I said, it's the perfect time.

29:27.560 --> 29:28.560
Like, what do I have to lose?

29:28.560 --> 29:29.720
I've got the Pixel phone.

29:29.720 --> 29:33.000
So if I break the phone, I'm fine.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.680
And likely it'll go just fine.

29:34.680 --> 29:36.720
So it's just a great opportunity.

29:36.720 --> 29:37.720
So I will.

29:37.720 --> 29:38.720
I will do that.

29:38.720 --> 29:42.120
Because I also know that if I get stuck, I'm just going to telegram you, Joe, it's not

29:42.120 --> 29:43.120
working.

29:43.120 --> 29:44.120
All right.

29:44.120 --> 29:48.160
Well, there's many, many more things developing every single week.

29:48.160 --> 29:49.300
There's something going on.

29:49.300 --> 29:53.080
There's a lot out there and you can get a digest of it right here.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.080
Every single week.
