00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,960
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 166, recorded on December 6th, 2020.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,960
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,960
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,960
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,960
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,800
And let's start with the many Linux desktop environments that saw updates this week.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,800
Right.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,800
One of them was Budgie.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,120
Budgie 10.52 is here.

10
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,480
Lots of changes and improvements.

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,880
It's more than a year of work that's went into this release, but I think probably the

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,240
most notable thing is they've based it on the latest GNOME 3.38 stack now.

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,740
But there are many improvements and fixes for you Budgie users out there.

14
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,620
So we do have a link to the announcements page in our show notes.

15
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:45,760
Next on the list, the KDE project released KDE Plasma 5.20.4 as the fourth maintenance

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,820
update to the Plasma 5.20 series with another batch of bug fixes and improvements.

17
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,760
But amongst those fixes, the audio volume applet no longer displays an unknown and non-functional

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,200
device with the text device name not found.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,080
I do like those nice quality of life fixes.

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,720
5.20.4 also is seeing some improvements for the Wayland session land, including some title

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,400
bar context menu fixes, a bug that would make apps crash when trying to view font related

22
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
items.

23
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,720
All of that has been fixed up.

24
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,000
And I'm happy to report I went ahead and did the upgrade this morning before the show.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,600
I figured let's try it live and upgraded and everything went just fine.

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,120
In fact, like a lot of my experiences with Plasma updates, it just chugs right along.

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,120
You know, I've occasionally had a few new bugs introduced, but they're always fixed

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
by the next update.

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:42,680
Yeah, sometimes some do sneak in some regressions, but they are really good and about fixing

30
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
it.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,360
And the trend line, I think has been has been generally positive, like it has with the GNOME

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,000
desktop recently.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,160
And this week saw GNOME 3.3.8.2 come out, which is second of many to come point releases

34
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,400
for the GNOME 3.3.8 desktop.

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,320
I think what's also notable in this is they've done some work to make their own GNOME OS

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,560
project more accessible for developers and users who want to test upcoming features in

37
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,560
the desktop environment, sort of a blessed GNOME environment for you to get to work on.

38
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,200
But I thought also worth mentioning here is this is it for GNOME in 2020.

39
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,320
They have a planned point release for the 3.3.8 desktop environment in early January,

40
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:29,400
along with the alpha release of the upcoming GNOME 40 desktop series.

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,400
There's a lot going on in that desktop series, version 40, and we've been discussing it and

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,640
digging in in Linux Unplugged.

43
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,400
So if you're curious, check out our coverage on GNOME 40 in Linux Unplugged.

44
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,560
People swear in the GTK universe, and after more than six months in development, Cinnamon

45
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,800
4.8 is finally here.

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,240
And actually, it's already made an appearance in the software repositories of Arch.

47
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,080
The biggest new feature in Cinnamon 4.8 is a new suspend then hibernate function that

48
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,080
instructs the desktop environment to first suspend the system and then hibernate after

49
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,260
a certain time period of inactivity.

50
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:14,040
Another important change in Cinnamon 4.8 can be found under the hood as the Cinnamon JavaScript

51
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,900
interpreter now uses Mozilla's newer Moe's JS 78 JavaScript engine.

52
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,560
This makes Cinnamon startup much faster and should be easier to maintain by other GNU

53
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,360
Linux distributions outside of Linux Mint.

54
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,160
Now speaking of Linux Mint, Cinnamon 4.8 will be the default desktop environment of the

55
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:40,320
upcoming Linux Mint 21, which will be based on Ubuntu 20.04.1 and expected to arrive sometime

56
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
near Christmas.

57
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:45,600
Well, speaking of Christmas, I think the Raspberry Pi is going to make a very tempting holiday

58
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,200
gift and it just got a little bit better.

59
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,520
Keeping with tradition, they have some year-of-end updates, including a brand new release of

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,120
Raspberry Pi OS.

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,640
They've updated the Chromium browser to version 84, but as they note, it did take a bit longer

62
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,440
than they would have hoped.

63
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,160
So it's quite a lot of work to get video hardware acceleration integrated with a new release

64
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,160
of the browser.

65
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,740
And yeah, I can appreciate that.

66
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,000
Nice to see it, though.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Nice to see it.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,560
It makes a big difference on that scale of hardware.

69
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,240
Another thing that's just kind of finally, but nice to see as well is Raspberry Pi OS

70
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,720
is switching to Pulse Audio.

71
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,440
Yes, Pulse Audio, the sound server.

72
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,840
The new modern setup, yeah.

73
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Not PipeWire.

74
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,840
No, no.

75
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,200
I was reaching out from Ulsa and they note in their announcement about this that Ulsa

76
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,720
had some limitations.

77
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,880
It could only handle one input and output at a time.

78
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,440
It didn't handle Bluetooth audio at all.

79
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,040
And it is an example of why I think Raspberry Pi OS is great for some.

80
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,180
For those of us who've been using Linux for a while, it's just a little too eclectic.

81
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,600
It's a little too esoteric still.

82
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,640
And the fact that they're just now switching to Pulse Audio when PipeWire is nearly here

83
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:04,040
is an example of why I kind of often will skew to using things like Ubuntu or Manjaro

84
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
on my Raspberry Pis.

85
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,700
Yeah, I don't think they were planning for someone like you who abuses their platform

86
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,700
a little too far.

87
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,320
I do push it to the limit sometimes.

88
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,920
But there is some improvements to accessibility in this release and that's actually something

89
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,120
they've been working on throughout this year.

90
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,160
Oka Screen Reader is in there at the start of the year and then over the summer they

91
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,620
put in a display magnifier for folks who have limited visibility.

92
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,840
And you know, I knock on Raspberry Pi, but it is really nice to see that kind of stuff

93
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,920
go in there.

94
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:38,000
And then there are nice customizations that make the quality of life on the Pi a little

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,240
bit better.

96
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,360
In this December release, there's also now a low voltage warning that's been added to

97
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,620
the battery monitoring plugin, easier for me to say, that will warn you if you're not

98
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,040
sufficiently supplying voltage.

99
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,640
And this is a super common problem with power adapters in the Raspberry Pi.

100
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,560
People don't quite get something that supplies enough power.

101
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,840
Or you're powering a USB disk off of the USB bus, which draws a lot of power.

102
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,800
And then when you're right on that line, it's nice to have something that will warn you.

103
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,520
So they've added that in there.

104
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,680
Also just notable for those of you who are going to be running this, it is now also based

105
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,920
on Linux kernel 5.4.79.

106
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,800
So if you're thinking about getting somebody a Pi 400 for the holidays, Wes, just got a

107
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,360
little bit better.

108
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,440
Something else for Pi fans to celebrate is that the V3DV driver is now officially Vulkan

109
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,040
1.0 Conformant for supporting things like high performance graphics and compute atop

110
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,120
the Raspberry Pi 4 and newer.

111
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,700
If you're not familiar, V3DV is the modern Vulkan driver for current Broadcom SOCs catering

112
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,240
to the Raspberry Pi 4 and presumably future chips as well.

113
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,520
Yeah, it's big to get Vulkan on there, but also they're working on native Wayland support.

114
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,680
An independent contributor has worked on the Wayland system integration for V3DV and went

115
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,720
through the steps to get it merged into mainline Mesa.

116
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,440
So we're going to have this in Mesa 21.0, which is due out next quarter.

117
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,160
This is a huge milestone for the Raspberry Pi and out of the box, general Linux distribution

118
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,720
graphics support.

119
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,720
And we've been waiting for quite a while to see this and now we're getting everything

120
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,920
we'd we'd hope to see.

121
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,840
So, you know, it'll take a little while for it to trickle down to everybody because you're

122
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,800
going to have to get newer kernels, newer Mesa, you're gonna have to get some of the

123
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,160
latest Vulkan updates, but eventually it'll be to the point where this stuff just comes

124
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,600
shipped in every distribution, making the Raspberry Pi closer to a just general computer

125
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,920
that you can put a Linux distro on.

126
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,960
Well, I guess I know what I'll be putting in your stocking this Christmas.

127
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,880
linode.com slash LAN.

128
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,840
Linode is the largest independent cloud.

129
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,640
Simplify your cloud infrastructure with our cloud hosting provider.

130
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,460
They are the back end for Jupiter broadcasting 3.0, been using them for a little while now.

131
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,100
And they're fast machines with native SSD storage, 40 gigabit connections, and a really

132
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,080
easy to use cloud manager.

133
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,000
But what's also great is Linode is local.

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You know what I mean?

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,960
They're a supporter of the Linux community.

136
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,620
They are independently owned and founded on a love for the technology that was coming

137
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,800
in the Linux kernel.

138
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,100
And then they've stepped up over the years by supporting open source initiatives.

139
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,840
They've been part of the Kubuntu project.

140
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,080
They've been part of All Things Open, and of course, our beloved Linux Fest Northwest.

141
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,440
And now here they are supporting independent media, making it possible for us to give our

142
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,900
independent content away for free to our audience.

143
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,480
Linode is dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

144
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,360
If it runs on Linux, it'll run on Linode.

145
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:41,720
I'll also recommend you check out their S3 compatible object storage, which is proven,

146
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,180
it's stable, and it's inexpensive technology.

147
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:50,360
It really makes it ideal for archives or backup sets or a static website, maybe assets like

148
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,920
images or soundboard clips, which we use it here to just embed the soundboard clips right

149
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
into our show notes.

150
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,000
Object storage is great too, because it doesn't require a server sitting in front of it.

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,700
So it's extremely economical.

152
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,960
They have all kinds of great features at Linode, from node bouncers to systems with GPUs or

153
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,400
dedicated CPUs, and they start at just $5 a month.

154
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:18,800
So if you go to linode.com slash LAN, you'll get a $100 60 day credit on a new account.

155
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,040
And with their price structure, you can build a lot of system with that $100 credit.

156
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,080
See what we've been talking about, because Linode costs 30 to 50% less than major cloud

157
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,920
providers like AWS.

158
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,260
And they were around three years before AWS.

159
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,760
And with 11 data centers worldwide, you're going to find just the right spot to deploy.

160
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,800
So to go to linode.com slash LAN to get started, get that $100 60 day credit, that's linode.com

161
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,000
slash LAN.

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,080

168
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:07,840
With SUSE's acquisition of Rancher Labs finalizing this week, we thought we'd add some context

169
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,880
to what could be a significant story.

170
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,900
Recent data from Dice's 2020 tech job report found there's been an 82% increase in job

171
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,120
demand for individuals with Kubernetes skills over the past year alone.

172
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,680
Dice predicts that the demand for Kubernetes skills will continue to grow and enjoy a projected

173
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,640
growth rate of more than 67% over the next 10 years.

174
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,100
Yeah, you could see how this is becoming a pretty important segment of the tech industry.

175
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,960
And Rancher quickly became a player in that space of some significance.

176
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,600
Here's a little background on them.

177
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,600
They were widely or I guess they still are widely known as one of the main innovators

178
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
in Kubernetes.

179
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,980
I think one of their key value adds is the ability to manage different deployments at

180
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,080
different scales across different providers.

181
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,640
That's one of the things Rancher is known for is handling those operational and security

182
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,600
challenges of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters.

183
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,320
Specifically, it supports any cloud native computing foundation certified Kubernetes

184
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,600
distribution.

185
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,120
So that includes the ones from Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.

186
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,160
And that's really nice because cloud lock-in is often a pain point for many enterprises.

187
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:24,640
Now Rancher Labs was funded with $10 million in 2015.

188
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,520
And then $20 million in 2016 and $40 million in 2020.

189
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,680
In May of 2020, they launched Rancher Academy.

190
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,280
And then in April of this year, Rancher Labs released an update to their management platform

191
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,240
that made it easier to upgrade without particular kinds of downtime.

192
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,000
In addition to simplifying remote access.

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,840
And it was around this time it was estimated that Rancher had 37,000 active users and 100

194
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,240
million downloads of its flagship software.

195
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,200
Now mind you, some of those 37,000 active users would be inside very large enterprises

196
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,920
with massive deployments.

197
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,520
Oh yeah.

198
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:10,180
And then in July 2020, Rancher announced its definitive agreement to be acquired by SUSE.

199
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,360
That deal closed this week.

200
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,280
When the acquisition was originally announced, Rancher Labs was quick to point out that they

201
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,400
intend to remain an open source first company.

202
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,520
Adrian Goins is in charge of Rancher Labs' community.

203
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,320
And he made this note on YouTube when the news came out.

204
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,280
There aren't very many companies who hold a true open source ethos at their core.

205
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,760
Even fewer companies hold true to that mission as they grow.

206
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,960
Rancher always has.

207
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,260
And that's why we are so excited to be joining forces with SUSE.

208
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,740
The acquisition upon closure will establish SUSE and Rancher as the open source innovator

209
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,080
of choice for Kubernetes, enterprise Linux, edge computing and AI.

210
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,800
We'll certainly be able to see that influence because after the deal, Rancher's CEO and

211
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:59,360
co-founder Shen Liang will be president of engineering and innovation at SUSE in charge

212
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,720
of all of their engineers.

213
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,600
Terms of the deal were not publicly disclosed, but the CNBC report published after the initial

214
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,520
announcement quoted sources familiar with the deal, saying that SUSE is paying between

215
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,980
$600 and $700 million.

216
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,840
This acquisition is SUSE's first step to expanding, really, since EQT bought SUSE from Microfocus

217
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,600
and freed it with the sole mission of growth in March 2019.

218
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
Right.

219
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Right.

220
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,740
Yes, EQT is still involved there, but this really follows something that we've reported

221
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:38,100
on recently, which is strong fiscal momentum and performance by SUSE.

222
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:44,000
In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, they saw bookings increase 30% year over year,

223
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,600
while global cloud revenue was up 70% year over year.

224
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,640
So they're leveraging that recent success to make a purchase that I think, at least

225
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:57,560
in my opinion, Wes, makes them a lot more relevant a lot faster all of a sudden in big

226
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,560
cloud computing.

227
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,880
It was something that we'd sometimes remark that SUSE had seemed like they'd kind of missed

228
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,080
the boat where Ubuntu and Red Hat had really been very successful.

229
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,920
SUSE was sort of in a distant third place, but with this acquisition, it seems like they

230
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,840
just fast forwarded a few years.

231
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,280
I know you've had some hands-on experience with this in the past.

232
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
Do you think this is a winner?

233
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Yeah.

234
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,560
You know, Rancher enjoys a good amount of popularity and goodwill in the Kubernetes

235
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
community, right?

236
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,480
They make some really handy tools that a lot of people adopt, and I think as you touched

237
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,240
on earlier, they're easy to get started with, right?

238
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,360
If you already have some clusters provisioned wherever, you've got one on-premises maybe,

239
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,200
you can bring them all under one roof with Rancher quite easily.

240
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,240
You don't have to go, say, adopt the whole Red Hat OpenShift workflow just to start playing

241
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,640
with it and figure things out.

242
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Right.

243
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,080
It sounds like, to my understanding, Rancher can, the tools, you can run Rancher OS or

244
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,780
you could actually run some of the tools on a distribution of your choice, and that seems

245
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,600
to be something they intend on keeping.

246
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,720
And I can see people liking that because you have multi-cloud support, you have multi-distro

247
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
support.

248
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
It really kind of gets around that lock-in issue.

249
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
Right.

250
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,440
You've got two companies joined into one with a long experience in open source and supporting

251
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,240
things like Linux, especially at SUSE, so they've kind of just said, hey, look, we also

252
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,640
do Kubernetes now.

253
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,640
Yeah.

254
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,260
The other thing about this that strikes me is SUSE, much like Red Hat, is a traditional

255
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,620
sales channel company.

256
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:27,420
They work in the sales world of enterprise.

257
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,520
It is their meat and potatoes.

258
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,000
It's an area where they're really competitive, and now they have a very competitive management

259
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,020
solution as well that has some good buzz.

260
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,760
Seems like they got pretty savvy over there at SUSE, and this is in the shadow of those

261
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,340
recent rumors of them coming out with an IPO as well.

262
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,220
And if they do, this just made that IPO look a lot more attractive because now they have

263
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,020
a really modern cloud offering, which, of course, the market always likes to see.

264
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:00,660
As many times as you can say, cloud or Kubernetes, all the better.

265
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,160
Linux.ting.com.

266
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,400
Ting Mobile is a smarter choice for everyone now.

267
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,180
It's the next generation of Ting Mobile.

268
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,700
It's here, and you should go see how much you can save.

269
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,280
And you get $25 off when you go to linux.ting.com.

270
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,380
You can get talk and text for just $10 a month and data plans starting at $15 and unlimited

271
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,700
from $45.

272
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,820
Yeah, I said the word unlimited.

273
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,260
And if you use two or 20 gigs a month, there's a perfect Ting plan for you and the family.

274
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,260
And no need to worry.

275
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,900
The only thing that's changed is a lower monthly phone bill.

276
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:36,100
You still get access to Ting's award-winning customer service with nationwide LTE and 5G

277
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,980
coverage and no contracts ever.

278
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,460
And Ting Mobile customers can now choose from three different plans just based on your data

279
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,460
needs.

280
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:50,380
It's really simple to switch to Ting and pretty much any phone is going to work on Ting.

281
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:55,500
So just go to linux.ting.com, check out your current phone, create an account, pick the

282
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,980
plan that's right for you.

283
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,500
When everything all lines up, Ting will send you a SIM card that you pop in your phone

284
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,100
and you activate in minutes.

285
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:08,580
I've been a Ting customer for probably seven years, six years, it's been a long time and

286
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,220
they've been great.

287
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,220
And now it's the next generation of Ting.

288
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:18,460
It's here and you should see how much you can save and get $25 off by going to linux.ting.com.

289
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:22,220
No contracts, you pick the plan that works just right for you and you can probably bring

290
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,220
a phone.

291
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,380
And if you want to get a new phone, there's a lot of great phones you can get from Ting

292
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,820
directly or grab however you like to get them and bring them.

293
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,580
Thank you to everyone who takes advantage of our sponsor's offer and supports the show.

294
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,740
Thanks to Ting for making it possible for this here independent podcast to be free to

295
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,620
our listeners.

296
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:44,820
Michael Larable founded Ferronix in 2004, now the largest open source news and Linux

297
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,580
hardware review site.

298
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,380
He also created the Ferronix test suite, a very impressive benchmarking tool that we

299
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,200
use over on Linux Unplugged all the time.

300
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,420
To say he knows a few things about Linux hardware is putting it lightly.

301
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:03,420
Michael joined me earlier this week to discuss the state of Linux hardware support in 2020.

302
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,820
And I had to start by asking him if he thinks it's a long shot to get Linux on the Apple

303
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,140
M1 up and running.

304
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,260
While I'm optimistic about in particular the one Patreon campaign happening right now by

305
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:21,920
Hector, I'd view it as a long shot, at least in terms of being able to have any production

306
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,020
quality support with working graphics in particular being the one area that will be the biggest

307
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,300
uphill battle for bringing up Linux on the M1 for any of those devices.

308
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,300
Right.

309
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,340
Yeah, I look at the devices that we have had documentation and more access to and it's

310
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,620
been an uphill battle just to get those working.

311
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,620
Exactly.

312
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,140
If you look at even just AMD and Intel laptops on the market these days and try to load Linux

313
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:50,060
on there, there's still various quirks to work through from power management especially.

314
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,940
And then obviously some laptops with keyboards or wireless still causing issues.

315
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,980
And then yes, certainly even in cases of open source graphics like with Nvidia, for instance,

316
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,220
where there have been the Nuovo developers for years working on the support, but they

317
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,740
end up being handicapped by firmware and documentation.

318
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:15,220
And so all these years later, the open source Nvidia driver performance for most of the

319
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,320
GPUs out there is very poor.

320
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,020
And I imagine that the M1 graphics are going to be in a very similar situation where it'll

321
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:29,180
take basically years and may or may not be performant.

322
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,460
And then the other obstacles like reverse engineering the M1 graphics will have to be

323
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:39,460
done on Mac OS and that's moving increasingly towards the Metal API.

324
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:45,100
And so it's going to be harder for them to basically debug and reverse engineer and replay

325
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:51,140
all the shaders from Mac on Linux and basically a lot more obstacles compared to what the

326
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:57,420
Nuovo developers or even PanFrost with the Armali graphics, FreeDreno for the Qualcomm

327
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:04,660
Adreno, at least there they have a Linux driver currently or a kernel driver from Android

328
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,300
and they may be able to build it and start sending in commands and trying to figure out

329
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:13,780
how things work on Linux and slowly rewrite either their shader compiler and then bring

330
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,780
up their OpenGL and Vulkan drivers.

331
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:21,220
But with the Apple M1 you really don't have a good starting point on Linux unless Apple

332
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:27,140
were to release a Linux driver that's closed source but I don't envision them releasing

333
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,780
any such driver and they don't have a reason to really.

334
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,300
I guess are prospects better for just competitive ARM that will work better with Linux?

335
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,580
How's that looking from a hardware perspective?

336
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,660
Certainly I would say very good.

337
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,800
Over the next year we should see more single board computers come to market that will hopefully

338
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:51,620
have the Neoverse N1 or X1 processor cores and then there's already the announced N2

339
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,880
and other iterations coming from ARM that are certainly looking very promising.

340
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:01,660
So at a minimum I would say that this Apple M1 effort would take at least a year to bring

341
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,660
up to get into some level of usefulness for end users and yeah over the course of that

342
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,540
same amount of time we're likely to see much more competitive ARM hardware out there which

343
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,500
will hopefully be using our Mali graphics where you may be able to then make use of

344
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:20,020
the existing PanFrost driver and there's at least some level of Linux support there thanks

345
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,740
to the various Android devices etc.

346
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:30,660
So there is much better prospect than hoping to get a very custom Apple M1 chip brought

347
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,660
up under Linux.

348
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,080
Well one topic that we follow on this show a lot and I know you follow it as well is

349
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:41,420
RISC-V. You think this improves prospects or changes the game at all for RISC-V?

350
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,980
I wouldn't say so at least in the near term.

351
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:50,860
RISC-V is doing some excellent things particularly with Sci-5 and their recently announced developer

352
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,460
board that will now be available at a lower cost that should really help boost the open

353
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:01,100
source and ecosystem support around there now that more developers will be able to handle

354
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:08,380
the cost of that board and start providing Linux build systems around there and basically

355
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,340
porting more software over there.

356
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,300
Let's talk a little bit more about bigger hardware and Linux.

357
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,900
Seems like it's been a pretty good year for AMD on Linux.

358
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,020
Oh it certainly has.

359
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:25,340
AMD's recent Ryzen 5000 or Zen 3 processor launch has been terrific.

360
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:31,580
20% plus generational improvements generally speaking in nearly all the workloads including

361
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,540
single threaded.

362
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,660
I've been super happy with the Zen 3 support on Linux.

363
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:42,540
There hasn't been any issues compared to Zen 1 or Zen 2 where there was that RD-Rand instruction

364
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:47,620
issue that was causing boot time problems or originally with Zen 1 where there was the

365
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:54,300
issue on performance marginality problem I believe they had described it as where there

366
00:22:54,300 --> 00:23:01,340
was a Linux performance issue that was rather peculiar and without any new chipsets being

367
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,780
introduced for the Zen 3 launch everything there from the motherboard perspective is

368
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:11,260
quite mature and stable so you can pretty much load up a modern Linux distribution and

369
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,500
have it run great with Ryzen 5000 and then in early 2021 there's already going to be

370
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,820
the Ryzen 5000 mobile series that will also should be very nice.

371
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,900
Oh I already want it.

372
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,740
You know okay so it's been a little bit more of an interesting story wouldn't you say on

373
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,820
the NVIDIA side they had the GPL condom issue the driver story isn't quite the same.

374
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,140
What are your thoughts with NVIDIA and Linux for 2020?

375
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,660
It's been an interesting year for sure at least they continue to have same day Linux

376
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:47,140
driver support that generally just works without issues and you can rely on them and there's

377
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:52,900
really no iffy bring up issues or anything under Linux for that proprietary driver.

378
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:58,860
The RTX 30 series performs great on Linux pretty much at feature parity to Windows especially

379
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:05,780
now that the Khronos group has ratified the Vulkan ray tracing extension so there's that

380
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:11,500
so the ray tracing will hopefully come to Linux in some form in terms of games or Steam

381
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:21,020
Play and Proton for compatibility porting of the DirectX 12 DXR to Vulkan.

382
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:26,820
So from the proprietary driver side everything is great and remains great with NVIDIA.

383
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,660
The open source side though is where it's still disappointing the Novo developers have

384
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:34,580
been spending years slowly working on things.

385
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:40,060
Red Hat though has been investing still in the driver which is a bit surprising they've

386
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:47,380
been investing a lot in the OpenCL compute support and Spear V for a computer as well

387
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:53,660
while at the same time the performance is quite poor so there's ultimately some sort

388
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,340
of backroom deal that Red Hat is engaging with NVIDIA in terms of improving this open

389
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:03,900
source driver stack and there was an announcement for GTC earlier this year that was delayed

390
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,440
in terms of some open source driver announcement so I believe they are collaborating over some

391
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,220
hopeful improvement which would likely be their increased documentation and or providing

392
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:21,140
more open firmware so that these modern GPUs can perform well on the open source driver

393
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,460
but at this point it's really up in the air and just speculating on what it could be but

394
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,760
given that Red Hat for years now has been investing and continues to have full-time

395
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:36,640
developers working on the driver there has to be some sort of plan at play.

396
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,800
So before we go let me ask you about what you're watching for 2021 it sounds like I

397
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,080
got a hint earlier but what else are you keeping an eye out for?

398
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:52,460
It'll be fun to see what exactly happens with Linux on the M1 it's gonna be a lengthy bring-up

399
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:57,260
process should it all pan out I wouldn't be surprised if in even weeks they might manage

400
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,660
to get Linux to boot on the M1 but in terms of it being a polished experience especially

401
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:09,720
on the graphic side it's a very long process I'd see more success there in getting Linux

402
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,740
virtualized on macOS and there you won't have to worry about power management and all the

403
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:20,760
other peculiarities on the software side Intel continues to do interesting investments in

404
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,460
Linux performance with Clear Linux but that's sort of been going downhill recently since

405
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,740
they divested in their desktop focus earlier this year and there really hasn't been too

406
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:36,740
much out of Intel on the past several months so we'll see what happens there but at least

407
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,820
in general Intel is still doing a lot of interesting Linux work they remain one of the largest

408
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:46,580
contributors to the Linux kernel and bringing up their hardware functionally to ensure that

409
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:53,180
it performs well on Linux at the time of launch and is in release distributions etc Ubuntu

410
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:58,460
has been doing fairly well these days with a lot of upstream improvements to GNOME and

411
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:04,620
other components and so overall it's going to be a very interesting 2021 for a variety

412
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:10,800
of reasons both on the hardware and software side and I don't really see any major challenge

413
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,180
as I think it's going to be fascinating hardware year maybe one of our better ones yet and

414
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:21,660
I thought 2020 was pretty good oh yeah certainly so and then just for instance yeah more ARM

415
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:27,180
hardware currently I'm testing the Ampere Ultra which is a ARM v8 server with the remaking

416
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:33,780
is the NEOVERSE N1 design and that performance has actually been phenomenal it's arguably

417
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,980
even more impressive than the M1 I'll bet in the server space I'll have benchmarks there

418
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:43,460
in the coming weeks but basically in a number of workloads the Ampere Ultra can actually

419
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:50,540
take on Intel's top-end 8280 Platinum configuration as well as how many cores how many ARM cores

420
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,900
are we talking here 80 cores per socket and so if you go with and that's physical cores

421
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:02,500
there's no hyper threading SMT involved so with a dual socket server like Mount Jade

422
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:10,260
you have 160 cores and I'm glad to hear that can take on the M1 but yeah even there though

423
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:15,680
it does show that there are more improvements to be made on the Linux software stack there's

424
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,260
still plenty of Linux software out there that really isn't optimized for ARM v8 sure it

425
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:26,740
can build but there's plenty of software not making use of ARM SIMD extensions with NEON

426
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:32,660
or just well-tuned for ARM so hopefully that will be an area that will improve upon in

427
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:36,580
2021 yeah I'll be watching and actually I'm sure you will be too and we'll be watching

428
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,980
