Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.260 --> 00:20.460
This is episode 67, recorded on August 19th, 2018.

00:20.460 --> 00:21.460
I'm Chris.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.460
And I'm Joe.

00:22.460 --> 00:23.460
Hello, Joe.

00:23.460 --> 00:29.200
It is really great to be connected to you while you are live down at OggCamp 2018.

00:29.200 --> 00:32.880
And we're kicking things off with a story that I bet you heard some buzz about at OggCamp

00:32.880 --> 00:35.960
because people are talking about it all over the internet.

00:35.960 --> 00:40.680
It's these rumors that Valve is working to make Windows games work on SteamOS.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.120
Yeah, unfortunately, all it is is rumors.

00:43.120 --> 00:47.600
So we don't know whether it's them using wine or whether they've written something themselves,

00:47.600 --> 00:49.440
or exactly how it's going to work.

00:49.440 --> 00:54.920
But it seems like a pretty logical step for them to do this in order to boost SteamOS

00:54.920 --> 00:56.000
as a platform.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.760
Like a few stories recently, this started by people digging on Reddit through Steam

01:00.760 --> 01:01.760
TB.

01:01.760 --> 01:06.760
And they found a string named string settings compat info, where the description reads,

01:06.760 --> 01:11.480
quote, steam will automatically install compatibility tools that allow you to play games from your

01:11.480 --> 01:14.760
library that were built for other operating systems, end quote.

01:14.760 --> 01:17.600
Yeah, and by other operating systems, they mean Windows.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.600
Absolutely.

01:18.600 --> 01:22.040
And there's a there's also another string in there they found the steam settings compat

01:22.040 --> 01:27.640
advanced info, which has a warning in there, which reads, quote, you may select a compatibility

01:27.640 --> 01:32.640
tool to use with games that have not been tested or verified to work on this platform.

01:32.640 --> 01:37.320
This may not work as expected and can cause issues with your games, including crashes

01:37.320 --> 01:39.760
and breaking saved games.

01:39.760 --> 01:43.760
That last warning there about crashes and breaking save games has most of the internet

01:43.760 --> 01:47.480
speculating this is some sort of wine compatibility layer.

01:47.480 --> 01:48.560
I don't know, Joe.

01:48.560 --> 01:52.720
I'm more inclined to think it's more like something like DX VK, which is that DirectX

01:52.720 --> 01:57.880
to Vulkan compatibility layer that would only work with Windows Vulkan games.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.200
Well, maybe it's both.

01:59.200 --> 02:02.600
Maybe the Vulkan games are going to work better than the others, but they're going to at least

02:02.600 --> 02:10.200
attempt to support the non Vulkan stuff just to widen the number of titles that they've

02:10.200 --> 02:11.960
got available for Steam OS.

02:11.960 --> 02:15.280
Well, something tells me we'll be learning more in the near future.

02:15.280 --> 02:19.200
These things have a way of just keep coming and leaking and then they grow and then eventually

02:19.200 --> 02:20.600
we see the complete story.

02:20.600 --> 02:21.600
So we'll just keep tracking it.

02:21.600 --> 02:26.040
Well, one project that we've been keeping an eye on is Endless OS and last time we were

02:26.040 --> 02:30.240
talking about it, things weren't going too well for them, but now things seem to be looking

02:30.240 --> 02:34.760
up because they are going to be shipping it on some Asus hardware.

02:34.760 --> 02:36.600
This is an interesting partnership indeed.

02:36.600 --> 02:41.600
You remember Endless, the GNOME focused Endless OS, which is based on Debian.

02:41.600 --> 02:48.240
It is shipping already on the Asus VivoBook 15 X540NA.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.660
That's one of the few products that you can get Endless on.

02:50.660 --> 02:55.320
It also has an option for Windows 10, but it sounds like this may be expanding a bit.

02:55.320 --> 02:59.160
I did some digging around too and there's already some support documents up on Asus's

02:59.160 --> 03:03.240
website as well as an introduction to Endless on Asus's website.

03:03.240 --> 03:07.080
So it seems really early days, but it could pan out to additional hardware.

03:07.080 --> 03:08.920
This seems like a pretty great partnership for them.

03:08.920 --> 03:09.920
Oh, definitely.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.800
It's pretty modest hardware, isn't it?

03:11.800 --> 03:16.000
Two gigabytes of RAM and we're not talking about i3s and i5s here.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.240
We're talking about the low cost, low end machines, but that's kind of what Endless

03:21.240 --> 03:22.520
is aimed at anyway, isn't it?

03:22.520 --> 03:25.680
So it sort of makes sense to start with that kind of hardware.

03:25.680 --> 03:26.680
I could see that.

03:26.680 --> 03:30.280
I would be curious to see how GNOME 3 shell performs on that.

03:30.280 --> 03:34.220
And keep in mind too, Endless has been heavily tailored to have pretty good functionality

03:34.220 --> 03:35.940
offline as well.

03:35.940 --> 03:38.920
That's kind of neat in a laptop of this size you might have in your bag.

03:38.920 --> 03:42.500
You want to break it out while you're on the commute and get some work done.

03:42.500 --> 03:46.940
And to have a bunch of stuff like Wikipedia and whatnot available offline might be a really

03:46.940 --> 03:49.800
nice combination with lightweight, cheap hardware.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.380
But we have been burned by Asus before, haven't we?

03:52.380 --> 03:57.880
Remember Xandros with the netbooks and they kind of made this whole market.

03:57.880 --> 04:02.040
And then when that didn't pan out, they just got rid of Linux completely and started saying

04:02.040 --> 04:04.220
it's better with Windows and stuff.

04:04.220 --> 04:06.600
They're saying that still right now on their website.

04:06.600 --> 04:09.840
And it's very heavily marketed as a Windows 10 home machine.

04:09.840 --> 04:15.340
They do seem to fail to go all in, like they don't quite grok that they need to completely

04:15.340 --> 04:16.340
go all in.

04:16.340 --> 04:20.800
Even if it's just one product, go all in like Dell did with the XPS 13.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.760
Instead they sort of have this back burner hidden down on their website that they don't

04:24.760 --> 04:28.760
really talk about, but you can go get support from Endless solution.

04:28.760 --> 04:33.600
Maybe that grows into something bigger, but when you sort of tend to repeat the mistakes

04:33.600 --> 04:35.640
of the past, you tend to get the same results.

04:35.640 --> 04:39.400
Well, to be fair, with the XPS 13, they do also do them with Windows.

04:39.400 --> 04:43.800
It's not going quite all in, is it, with the Linux, but at least they are making a proper

04:43.800 --> 04:49.520
effort and you get people like Barton coming along and really promoting it and engaging

04:49.520 --> 04:50.520
with the community.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.760
Whereas, yeah, not so much with Asus, unfortunately.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.760
Yeah.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.820
I mean, really to clarify the going all in statement, I just mean a website that I can

04:56.820 --> 05:01.220
go to where this product has been end to end tested running Linux and I can see a whole

05:01.220 --> 05:03.060
website about the information.

05:03.060 --> 05:06.240
Like it's a real product from the company, not something hidden away.

05:06.240 --> 05:10.620
That's all they really have to do is keep selling the Windows 10 version, keep making

05:10.620 --> 05:13.600
a website that talks about all the great features of Windows 10.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.960
Also make a website that highlights and features the Ubuntu version or whatever it might be

05:17.960 --> 05:19.120
and do the same thing.

05:19.120 --> 05:22.160
That's all I'm saying is go all in in a way that's a full product.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.160
Yeah.

05:23.160 --> 05:24.160
Well, it is early days.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.160
They're just testing the water.

05:25.160 --> 05:28.480
If they sell well, then maybe they will do that and all we can do is hope really.

05:28.480 --> 05:29.480
I think so.

05:29.480 --> 05:32.720
And wouldn't it be really interesting to see if those could get some traction and education,

05:32.720 --> 05:37.560
the price point combined with Endless, that could be a really nice document editing machine

05:37.560 --> 05:39.880
in high schools or or even middle school.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.760
So there could be some real potential in education.

05:41.760 --> 05:47.080
Well, another potential option for that kind of low end hardware would be the Trinity desktop.

05:47.080 --> 05:51.480
TDE, a continuation originally of KDE 3.

05:51.480 --> 05:55.960
Now it's really it's its own project and they just had a big update.

05:55.960 --> 05:59.880
They just shipped version R1 14.05.

05:59.880 --> 06:03.960
It's their fifth maintenance release of the series and they've made some nice maintenance

06:03.960 --> 06:07.960
improvements, fixed things like Ogg playback and some sound server issues and did some

06:07.960 --> 06:12.260
major code base refactoring, they say, and fixed a few memory leaks as well and added

06:12.260 --> 06:13.680
a few features.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.160
But that's not really the headline feature here.

06:15.160 --> 06:22.320
The headline feature is that a desktop environment that harkens back to KDE 3, the 90s is still

06:22.320 --> 06:25.000
getting updates and seeing releases.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.360
I love open source.

06:26.360 --> 06:27.840
Well, yeah.

06:27.840 --> 06:31.720
The real headline for me is that I thought that they were pretty much dead because we

06:31.720 --> 06:35.120
haven't had a release for nearly two years.

06:35.120 --> 06:37.200
And here we are with a new release.

06:37.200 --> 06:44.440
So just open source refuses to die, especially people's favorite desktop environments.

06:44.440 --> 06:47.000
I am seriously tempted to give it a go.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.280
I did make an attempt before the show, but their live CDs haven't been updated yet.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.960
So I might kick the tires in a few days once they've updated their live CDs.

06:53.960 --> 06:56.160
I just I got to try it out for nostalgia purposes.

06:56.160 --> 07:01.080
Well, I haven't had much time because I've been at odd camp, obviously, as we mentioned,

07:01.080 --> 07:04.200
hence my echoing audio, sorry about that.

07:04.200 --> 07:09.160
But I did have a quick chance to spin up slacks in a VM last night.

07:09.160 --> 07:14.960
And after I did app get dist upgrade on it, because it is Debian based, it did show as

07:14.960 --> 07:18.360
being 14.0.5.

07:18.360 --> 07:21.100
But it said that it was from April of this year.

07:21.100 --> 07:22.960
So it's all a bit confusing, really.

07:22.960 --> 07:26.680
But I don't think it's changed massively in terms of features and stuff.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.880
It's quite a lot of bug fixes.

07:28.880 --> 07:33.200
And there are a few features, but the overall aesthetic of it hasn't changed.

07:33.200 --> 07:38.800
And it did give me kind of fond memories of my early Linux days, funny enough with slacks

07:38.800 --> 07:41.920
being this really light distro.

07:41.920 --> 07:47.680
And I don't know as much as I do really appreciate what the KDE team has done with plasma five

07:47.680 --> 07:52.920
looking back at KDE three, okay, it looks a little bit dated, okay, it looks a lot dated,

07:52.920 --> 07:55.640
but functionally, it is a great desktop.

07:55.640 --> 08:02.080
Yeah, you hate to give Microsoft credit, but that start menu, launcher bar, quick icons

08:02.080 --> 08:07.000
setup that they kind of refined after Windows 95 over the years, and then lost the trail

08:07.000 --> 08:11.000
after Windows Vista, it is a functional launcher.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.960
And if you add that, and you put a decent file manager on there, and you have good performance

08:14.960 --> 08:18.840
in a terminal, you're pretty close to having most people's bases covered.

08:18.840 --> 08:23.560
Yeah, and if you look at KDE four, I think they just added too much bloat to that.

08:23.560 --> 08:26.160
And it took people a long time to get used to it.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.800
And I never got used to it.

08:27.800 --> 08:33.400
And it was only really when five came out that I reevaluated that situation as an it's

08:33.400 --> 08:39.360
almost like four is that Vista type release, probably kill me for saying that.

08:39.360 --> 08:43.920
But three was great, but a bit dated for not so much.

08:43.920 --> 08:47.080
But now with five, that just keeps getting better and better.

08:47.080 --> 08:49.920
And I don't know, it's good to see Trinity.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.960
It's a little bit like Marte, isn't it?

08:51.960 --> 08:55.920
In a sense, Marte is more modern, of course.

08:55.920 --> 09:00.820
But it just goes to show that if you make major changes, some people just will not like

09:00.820 --> 09:01.820
those changes.

09:01.820 --> 09:07.160
And they'll just hang around with the old version and fork it and still maintain it.

09:07.160 --> 09:11.600
It gives me a lot of hope, actually, for XFCE that maybe I can just keep using that forever.

09:11.600 --> 09:12.600
It will never die.

09:12.600 --> 09:19.560
I mean, imagine, could you imagine if KDE 3 is still getting some love today, then XFCE

09:19.560 --> 09:21.760
is probably good for the rest of your life.

09:21.760 --> 09:27.360
Well, with the amount I drink, that won't be too long.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.460
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

09:29.460 --> 09:33.260
It's a platform to learn more about Linux and all the things that runs Linux, advanced

09:33.260 --> 09:37.460
training tools that increase your skills and encourage critical thinking, full featured

09:37.460 --> 09:41.960
training library with servers that you spin up on demand, interactive guides as you dig

09:41.960 --> 09:47.220
in, real human being instructors ready to help you, topic experts on the subject, practice

09:47.220 --> 09:49.040
exams and quizzes.

09:49.040 --> 09:52.520
There's so much to the platform that I encourage you to take advantage of that seven day free

09:52.520 --> 09:53.520
trial.

09:53.520 --> 09:54.520
And don't worry if you're busy.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.960
They have a course scheduler where you can pick a course in a time frame and it'll help

09:56.960 --> 09:57.960
you stick to it.

09:57.960 --> 10:00.560
They have a vibrant community that keeps you going.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.680
They have a flashcard system that gets forked by that community.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.200
So there's a lot happening there.

10:05.200 --> 10:08.480
And if you're just trying out Linux Academy, you're not sure yet, check out their YouTube

10:08.480 --> 10:10.800
channel Linux Academy com on YouTube.

10:10.800 --> 10:14.260
They're posting stuff every week now, like several things.

10:14.260 --> 10:18.840
Their CEO, Anthony, just posted a new video as well as another edition of Google Cloud

10:18.840 --> 10:23.040
Weekly just went up and they're doing some Docker beginner training sessions over on

10:23.040 --> 10:24.680
their channel to all for free.

10:24.680 --> 10:26.420
They're just passionate about this kind of stuff.

10:26.420 --> 10:27.480
So try them out.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.900
Go try out the course scheduler, maybe the learning pass.

10:29.900 --> 10:33.880
See a series of course and content that's been planned by an instructor for your specific

10:33.880 --> 10:35.000
career track.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.840
Try out one of those hands on labs.

10:36.840 --> 10:43.520
It's all available at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

10:43.520 --> 10:51.120
So let's talk about Richard Hughes again and the LVFS project, Linux Vendor Firmware Service.

10:51.120 --> 10:54.680
We've talked about Lenovo joining the project and how great that is, especially for you

10:54.680 --> 10:56.840
wanting to buy a ThinkPad soon.

10:56.840 --> 11:03.840
But now Richard wants to broaden the scope a little bit and his next target is NVME drives,

11:03.840 --> 11:05.520
SSDs.

11:05.520 --> 11:10.560
And he wants people to submit some data about what SSDs are out there so that he knows what

11:10.560 --> 11:11.560
to work on.

11:11.560 --> 11:15.600
And he's got a post on the GNOME blog with instructions of how to do that.

11:15.600 --> 11:22.760
So if you do have an NVME drive in your machine, then do check out linuxactionnews.com slash

11:22.760 --> 11:24.760
67 and there'll be a link there.

11:24.760 --> 11:29.640
You can click through to his blog, run a couple of commands, send him off the data and help

11:29.640 --> 11:31.880
with getting some firmware updates for SSDs.

11:31.880 --> 11:32.880
I ran the command.

11:32.880 --> 11:36.000
It's pretty straightforward on Ubuntu and Fedora systems.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.920
The package you need to install is NVME dash CLI.

11:39.920 --> 11:44.080
And then once you install NVME dash CLI, you run the commands that Richard outlines and

11:44.080 --> 11:49.680
you basically get back like the manufacturer identification and a model number, at least

11:49.680 --> 11:52.880
on my Samsung drives, and I'll send those off to him.

11:52.880 --> 11:53.880
That's pretty nice.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.560
And he has all the information you'd need on the blog post there.

11:55.560 --> 11:59.720
Yeah, and I think this kind of opt in approach is not going to offend anyone, is it?

11:59.720 --> 12:03.280
Because if you don't want to share your data, you just don't run the commands.

12:03.280 --> 12:08.720
This isn't something baked into any distro or desktop environment, but that does mean

12:08.720 --> 12:12.920
he's going to get less data as a result of possibly doing something like putting it into

12:12.920 --> 12:14.240
GNOME software or whatever.

12:14.240 --> 12:17.620
Yeah, hopefully if he just gets an idea, you know, a snapshot of what the more popular

12:17.620 --> 12:20.720
drives out there, it'll at least tell him where to start working.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.100
The Linux kernel developers have been up to some hard work.

12:23.100 --> 12:26.240
We've got not one, but two kernel updates in the last week.

12:26.240 --> 12:29.720
Yeah, 4.18 and then a few point releases.

12:29.720 --> 12:34.140
We've got the 4.18.3, which is already out within a week.

12:34.140 --> 12:37.240
But this 4.18 kernel is a big one, isn't it?

12:37.240 --> 12:38.880
There's a lot of new features in there.

12:38.880 --> 12:43.640
Yeah, not only do you get support for the AMD Radeon RX Vega M chips, complete support

12:43.640 --> 12:46.880
for the Raspberry Pi 3B and 3B+.

12:46.880 --> 12:51.880
We're also getting support for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 ARM chip, which is what's found

12:51.880 --> 12:53.920
in those new Windows 10 ARM systems.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.220
And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

12:55.220 --> 13:00.600
There's all kinds of great things in 4.18, even some improvements to USB Type-C and Thunderbolt.

13:00.600 --> 13:05.120
But what do you make of this inclusion of the spec file system encryption support?

13:05.120 --> 13:09.540
Yeah, the spec cipher, which has gotten some buzz around it online because the NSA was

13:09.540 --> 13:12.840
involved with its creation.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.420
This is something that I have to dig more into.

13:15.420 --> 13:19.620
You know, I do understand why people have a strong reaction, but I think it might be

13:19.620 --> 13:20.880
a future deep dive topic.

13:20.880 --> 13:24.640
Yeah, there's a lot of speculation, isn't there, that the NSA have got the means to

13:24.640 --> 13:28.880
crack this cipher, and that's why they're so keen to push it out into the mainstream.

13:28.880 --> 13:32.960
I suppose we don't have to use it, do we, just because it's in the kernel, but I think

13:32.960 --> 13:34.440
it's upset quite a lot of people.

13:34.440 --> 13:36.400
Yeah, I think that's why it's worthy of the deep dive.

13:36.400 --> 13:39.320
Yeah, well, we'll have to get Wes on the case for a TechSnap episode.

13:39.320 --> 13:43.760
Well, speaking of TechSnap, we did a complete breakdown of Foreshadow, or that L1 data cache

13:43.760 --> 13:47.120
bug, whichever one you like to call it, the terminal fault.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.360
That also got patched this week.

13:48.360 --> 13:53.320
Now, just a quick high level, it was discovered that memory present in the L1 cache of an

13:53.320 --> 13:59.680
Intel CPU core may be exposed to malicious processes that are executing on the CPU core.

13:59.680 --> 14:03.760
This vulnerability is known as L1 terminal fault, or L1 TF.

14:03.760 --> 14:09.000
A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to expose sensitive information from other

14:09.000 --> 14:10.080
guest hosts.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.620
So it was a big deal for the cloud providers.

14:12.620 --> 14:15.760
There's a new kernel update as well that mitigates this.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.360
Yet more speculative execution vulnerabilities.

14:18.360 --> 14:24.040
I remember when Spectre and Meltdown, the news of that broke, and we said at the time,

14:24.040 --> 14:25.540
this is just the tip of the iceberg here.

14:25.540 --> 14:27.480
We know there's going to be a lot more of this.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.440
And sure enough, here we are.

14:29.440 --> 14:32.080
I think this is the third or fourth one that has a name.

14:32.080 --> 14:36.380
Yeah, if you're on a supported distribution, it is worth upgrading because one of the things

14:36.380 --> 14:40.920
we've also discovered is sometimes the initial headline comes out and then people work away

14:40.920 --> 14:45.320
at it for a few weeks and they discover other clever ways to exploit those flaws to go after

14:45.320 --> 14:46.440
desktop users.

14:46.440 --> 14:50.760
So it starts really impacting cloud providers because you have this ability for the guest

14:50.760 --> 14:52.760
VM to read data from other guest VMs.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.160
That's bad.

14:54.160 --> 14:58.840
But given time, researchers and others tend to find ways to go after desktop users.

14:58.840 --> 15:03.200
So if you're on a distribution that's getting an update, the Ubuntu, the Debian, the CentOS,

15:03.200 --> 15:06.100
the Red Hats, go apply your update.

15:06.100 --> 15:09.420
And one of the emails that you definitely don't want to wake up to when you are away

15:09.420 --> 15:16.080
at a conference like OggCamp is an unattended upgrades reboot required email because, okay,

15:16.080 --> 15:17.920
it's normally fine when you reboot.

15:17.920 --> 15:21.280
It almost always is, but there's always that feeling in your stomach like, please come

15:21.280 --> 15:22.280
back up.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.280
Please.

15:23.280 --> 15:27.680
And so I did it and thankfully I was able to go to OggCamp and not spend all day trying

15:27.680 --> 15:28.680
to fix it.

15:28.680 --> 15:29.680
Well, good on you.

15:29.680 --> 15:30.680
You stayed current, Joe.

15:30.680 --> 15:31.760
I'm proud of you.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.520
Some people might say, oh, that Joe, he never installs his updates, but that right there

15:34.520 --> 15:35.720
proves otherwise.

15:35.720 --> 15:39.600
