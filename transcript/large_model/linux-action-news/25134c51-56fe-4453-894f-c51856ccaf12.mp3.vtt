00:00.000 --> 00:05.420
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

00:05.420 --> 00:09.280
Episode 138, recorded on December 20th, 2019.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.280
I'm Chris.

00:10.280 --> 00:11.280
And I'm Joe.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.280
Hello, Joe.

00:12.280 --> 00:17.100
It's one of our final episodes of the year, and it is our annual look back at the major

00:17.100 --> 00:23.800
stories of 2019, and there was a trend that just bubbled up all year long.

00:23.800 --> 00:29.360
And that was big commercial cloud versus free software projects.

00:29.360 --> 00:36.040
We saw various approaches to this by the open source projects, changing licenses, and various

00:36.040 --> 00:43.320
attempts to essentially stop AWS and the other clouds to a lesser extent from taking that

00:43.320 --> 00:49.800
open source software, selling it as a service, and not contributing back to the original

00:49.800 --> 00:50.800
project.

00:50.800 --> 00:55.420
What we have been witnessing and likely will continue to witness for some time is a conflict

00:55.420 --> 00:59.840
between the letter of the license and the spirit of the license.

00:59.840 --> 01:05.480
And the open source projects kept making adjustments to try to make the two line up a little bit

01:05.480 --> 01:06.480
more.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.760
But each adjustment comes with a reaction.

01:08.760 --> 01:15.080
Well, reactions like removing MongoDB from quite a few distributions, because they changed

01:15.080 --> 01:20.600
to the server side public license, which was almost an open source license, but not an

01:20.600 --> 01:23.000
OSI approved open source license.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.720
There were some caveats in it, which meant that it couldn't be in distributions like

01:27.720 --> 01:29.280
Debian and Fedora.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.480
That really caught our attention.

01:30.480 --> 01:37.320
The other one was Chef going 100% open source, and the extremely elaborate rationale they

01:37.320 --> 01:38.960
posted in doing so.

01:38.960 --> 01:43.800
Yeah, and we also saw it with Redis, with the company Redis Labs changing the license

01:43.800 --> 01:46.640
so that some of the modules were proprietary.

01:46.640 --> 01:51.040
And we actually saw Debian developers forking those bits of software to keep them going.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.400
Yeah, that was absolutely a standout moment.

01:53.400 --> 01:58.160
It really feels like this is going to come to a head in 2020, because these companies

01:58.160 --> 02:02.840
just don't really have a business model, the open source companies anymore, thanks to the

02:02.840 --> 02:05.080
likes of AWS.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.400
And so something is going to have to change here.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.360
Yeah, the business model, they'll have to find a new one.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.560
And I think that's what they're exploring.

02:12.560 --> 02:14.200
It's not impossible.

02:14.200 --> 02:18.400
And I won't say anything yet, because this isn't our predictions episode.

02:18.400 --> 02:22.600
But there are adjustments Amazon could make on their end, so they're not poisoning the

02:22.600 --> 02:23.600
well.

02:23.600 --> 02:28.080
Let's be honest here, these open source projects are making them a ton of money.

02:28.080 --> 02:31.360
There's some best interests at play here, they just have an opportunity they haven't

02:31.360 --> 02:32.360
recognized yet.

02:32.360 --> 02:38.380
Well, I hope you're right, I really hope that Amazon starts contributing to these projects.

02:38.380 --> 02:41.680
Even just a little bit of money would probably put this problem to bed, but I suppose we'll

02:41.680 --> 02:42.680
see.

02:42.680 --> 02:47.680
Meanwhile, one of the other tech giants, Google, has had a lot going on this year.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.840
There's so many areas when it comes to Google we could talk about.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.260
We just recently discussed Flutter and Fuchsia.

02:54.260 --> 02:58.220
Of course, Android is a major area of discussion.

02:58.220 --> 03:02.400
But the one that's on my mind, and it's just the timing of release, and also because I

03:02.400 --> 03:07.880
was playing Stadia right before we started recording, but Stadia, Stadia is on the tip

03:07.880 --> 03:08.880
of my mind.

03:08.880 --> 03:09.880
And where's that going?

03:09.880 --> 03:14.400
It's the most unknown aspect of Google, I think, in the future.

03:14.400 --> 03:19.040
And it was sort of the crazy thing I didn't really see coming from them either.

03:19.040 --> 03:24.120
And they actually did launch it in 2019, which I also was a little skeptical of.

03:24.120 --> 03:28.040
So just kind of question marks all over the place with Stadia.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.000
Yeah, they just about launched it.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.720
It got pretty poor reviews, although it seems to be improving now as we get towards the

03:34.720 --> 03:36.080
end of the year.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.640
And you've had a pretty good experience with your gaming, haven't you?

03:38.640 --> 03:40.840
Yeah, I really don't mind it.

03:40.840 --> 03:44.640
I got the founder's thing, so I have the controller, and it has to be wired in when I'm on the

03:44.640 --> 03:45.640
desktop.

03:45.640 --> 03:50.720
But just before we started, I decided to pull the trigger, and I got Red Dead Redemption.

03:50.720 --> 03:57.640
And the experience is really nice, because after the transaction is complete, you can

03:57.640 --> 03:58.760
immediately play.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.480
No 20-gigabyte game to download.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.680
And no doubt you got it for a bargain price as well.

04:03.680 --> 04:08.960
Well, I mean, it was like $50, which that's the tricky thing with Stadia.

04:08.960 --> 04:11.180
That's part of why it's such an unknown.

04:11.180 --> 04:13.880
What are they going to do if they shut this thing down and people have put several hundred

04:13.880 --> 04:16.880
dollars or more into games on this platform?

04:16.880 --> 04:17.880
What are they going to do?

04:17.880 --> 04:20.040
Are they going to get each game maker to refund them?

04:20.040 --> 04:23.560
I don't think so, because I think it's the game makers that are setting the price.

04:23.560 --> 04:26.800
If Google had their way, I don't think it'd be 60 bucks for a game.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.800
Well, we'll see.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.700
I remain very skeptical about how widely this is going to be adopted and whether Google's

04:31.700 --> 04:35.520
going to kill it, but I think it'll probably make it through 2020.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.320
We'll have to see.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.040
Android had a pretty strong year.

04:39.040 --> 04:42.120
Well, it did, but it was also a bit up and down.

04:42.120 --> 04:49.280
The antitrust suit that's happening in Europe was somewhat resolved, with Google being forced

04:49.280 --> 04:53.200
into giving people a choice of what browser they run on Android.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.200
Right.

04:54.200 --> 04:58.720
But at the same time, we got Android 10, and we started to see some of the fruits of Project

04:58.720 --> 05:05.120
Treble pay off with several notable high-end devices shipping with Android 10 on day one

05:05.120 --> 05:06.120
of the release.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.200
Yeah, I was quite surprised about that at the time, but I'm really hoping we're going

05:09.200 --> 05:14.680
to see more and more of that as we go into next year and when Android 11 comes out.

05:14.680 --> 05:18.320
Google has been trying to do that a lot more with things like Project Mainline, but don't

05:18.320 --> 05:22.120
confuse the name Project Mainline with a mainline kernel, which is something Google has been

05:22.120 --> 05:25.760
thinking about this year, but it feels a long way off.

05:25.760 --> 05:29.180
Yeah, that ironically might be one of their most pie-in-the-sky things they've talked

05:29.180 --> 05:30.180
about recently.

05:30.180 --> 05:32.240
Maybe more pie in the sky than Stadia.

05:32.240 --> 05:33.240
Yeah.

05:33.240 --> 05:37.080
It's really a bit of a dichotomy, because look at Chromebooks.

05:37.080 --> 05:42.600
All new Chromebooks got Linux apps, and there was even a whole range of Chromebooks that

05:42.600 --> 05:45.500
just were gifted an extra year of support.

05:45.500 --> 05:49.160
Really solid Android year, solid Chromebook year.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.680
Google services, really reliable.

05:51.680 --> 05:54.640
At the same time, they didn't take over the world.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.360
There's still plenty of good alternatives.

05:56.360 --> 06:00.680
In fact, I would argue there's more alternatives to Google services than ever, and they're

06:00.680 --> 06:02.520
better than ever.

06:02.520 --> 06:07.880
I thought at this time last year, we would be even more entrenched into Google.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.440
We would be even more locked in.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.360
I do not feel like that's the case.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.800
I have lots of options at the end of 2019.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.560
Google had a great year, but it didn't mean I had to have a bad year.

06:17.560 --> 06:22.840
Well, towards the end of the year, we saw a clear sign that Chromebooks are very likely

06:22.840 --> 06:26.040
to support FWAPD and the LVFS project.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.360
Joe, it's really been the year of LVFS.

06:28.360 --> 06:34.280
See, remember in August of 2018, Lenovo joined, and that was like a, whoa, whoa, everybody

06:34.280 --> 06:35.280
wake up.

06:35.280 --> 06:36.280
What's going on here?

06:36.280 --> 06:44.360
But since then, Phoenix, the BIOS maker joined, HP joined, tons of companies and smaller manufacturers

06:44.360 --> 06:49.520
that create appliances that we don't talk about as often also have been joining.

06:49.520 --> 06:55.340
It's seen so much growth that I almost worry about the sustainability of the project if

06:55.340 --> 06:57.320
it grows anymore.

06:57.320 --> 07:01.140
We have seen them join the Linux Foundation as well, so perhaps some support could come

07:01.140 --> 07:02.640
from there in 2020.

07:02.640 --> 07:08.600
I hope so, because as we've seen more companies get involved with this and more and more devices

07:08.600 --> 07:14.080
being supported, it feels like there needs to be a bit more organization there, a bit

07:14.080 --> 07:19.600
more admin, because just there is more admin being created just from the sheer number of

07:19.600 --> 07:20.600
moving parts.

07:20.600 --> 07:24.900
I've said it before, but I just really think it's a very vital project.

07:24.900 --> 07:27.960
And here's an interesting way to look at it.

07:27.960 --> 07:32.480
Imagine if we didn't have LVFS and somebody came to you and said, how do you do firmware

07:32.480 --> 07:33.620
updates in Linux?

07:33.620 --> 07:40.540
And our answer still was, well, you can reboot into Windows or sometimes free DOS or every

07:40.540 --> 07:43.680
now and then a vendor puts a recovery environment that you can load into.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.100
And some BIOSes, you can just do it now.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.440
There's like a little updater in there and you just put a little thumb drive in there

07:48.440 --> 07:50.600
and you go in there and you select this, my BIOS?

07:50.600 --> 07:51.600
What's my BIOS?

07:51.600 --> 07:55.080
It's that menu you go into in your system posts.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.080
What's a post?

07:56.080 --> 07:57.720
Can you imagine this conversation?

07:57.720 --> 08:02.160
And with LVFS, it's, yeah, you'll just get an update notification if you're using an

08:02.160 --> 08:03.160
XYZ desktop.

08:03.160 --> 08:05.680
And it's just right there automatically.

08:05.680 --> 08:10.360
It's one of those, you can't believe we wouldn't have something like this kind of features

08:10.360 --> 08:11.360
now.

08:11.360 --> 08:16.000
So I'd really love to see it just get completely solid, get backing from everybody.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
I'd love to see Huzy get a whole staff, give him a staff.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
You know what?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.760
I'll give him a million bucks.

08:22.760 --> 08:26.000
I mean, you know, now that I'm writing IBM's checks.

08:26.000 --> 08:30.960
Well, you have to wonder how much money Microsoft has been spending on open source this year.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.800
I would imagine a little bit more than a million dollars.

08:33.800 --> 08:34.800
Oh, Microsoft.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.280
I bet we just triggered some people in the audience.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.040
Here we are.

08:40.040 --> 08:44.000
And people are still struggling how to understand Microsoft.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.880
But we have witnessed a transformation of a company.

08:46.880 --> 08:53.440
I don't think that for a minute, Microsoft is in free software for the morality or ideals

08:53.440 --> 08:54.440
of it.

08:54.440 --> 08:59.000
I think they figured out how to monetize a business around development for the web and

08:59.000 --> 09:02.840
other services using open source.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.420
And as a result, we've benefited from it.

09:05.420 --> 09:09.220
And nothing could be a clear signal of that.

09:09.220 --> 09:15.080
Nothing could be more of a lightning rod to indicate their commitment than when they open

09:15.080 --> 09:16.740
sourced Windows calculator.

09:16.740 --> 09:19.400
It was a real watershed moment, wasn't it?

09:19.400 --> 09:20.400
Watershed, Joe.

09:20.400 --> 09:28.680
It shifted the industry, really moved the needle, and disrupted everything we know about

09:28.680 --> 09:29.680
open source.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.560
Yeah, especially open source calculators.

09:32.560 --> 09:33.560
Yeah.

09:33.560 --> 09:36.200
Actually, though, you know, at the same time, didn't see it coming.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.240
It was actually legitimately surprising and adorable.

09:39.240 --> 09:46.200
Yeah, we very quickly saw some pull requests improving it, which is quite something.

09:46.200 --> 09:55.960
For me, it was announcing WSL 2, and the Windows Terminal, and even releasing Edge, the new

09:55.960 --> 10:00.280
browser for Linux, which hasn't happened yet, but has been announced.

10:00.280 --> 10:07.040
And Teams, and Teams, which they've billed as the first Office 365 app coming to Linux.

10:07.040 --> 10:11.400
And I've tried to reserve judgment on a lot of this, especially with my background with

10:11.400 --> 10:14.000
Microsoft.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.980
But I've talked to more and more developers that are working with Microsoft in some capacity

10:18.980 --> 10:25.900
or another, and they consistently tell me that Microsoft is responsive, and listens,

10:25.900 --> 10:31.400
and replies to their emails, and answers their questions, and cooperates.

10:31.400 --> 10:37.240
Which is really all you can ask for from an open source participant.

10:37.240 --> 10:41.480
If a company is going to participate in open source, it kind of matters that they respond

10:41.480 --> 10:42.480
to pull requests.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.760
It kind of matters that they answer your questions.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.640
And these developers are telling me they're doing that.

10:47.640 --> 10:53.000
So you can still sit here, and you can wonder why, and you can question their morals, and

10:53.000 --> 10:57.560
you can even label us as idiots for even talking about Microsoft in even the slightest positive

10:57.560 --> 10:58.560
tone.

10:58.560 --> 11:02.280
But at the end of the day, it's clear they're motivated to make this work.

11:02.280 --> 11:03.640
Will it always be this way?

11:03.640 --> 11:04.640
Who knows?

11:04.640 --> 11:06.040
But is it this way today?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.040
Yes.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.920
Is it likely to be this way for the foreseeable future?

11:09.920 --> 11:11.080
I think so.

11:11.080 --> 11:15.280
But do you think that the history and the members of the community who still remember

11:15.280 --> 11:19.240
that history strongly are going to be a problem for them?

11:19.240 --> 11:23.160
Because as you said, every time we talk about Microsoft, if we're not incredibly negative

11:23.160 --> 11:26.180
about them, we get a lot of backlash.

11:26.180 --> 11:27.600
And you see it.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.440
It's not just us talking about it.

11:29.440 --> 11:35.560
Everywhere they're mentioned, there's a certain portion of the community who just will never

11:35.560 --> 11:38.780
forgive them for the things that they've done in the past.

11:38.780 --> 11:43.520
But do you think that they're not really interested in that segment of the community, and they're

11:43.520 --> 11:50.120
just forging ahead and getting new developers and new people into open source and driving

11:50.120 --> 11:51.800
them towards Azure?

11:51.800 --> 11:53.200
Seems like that's it, huh?

11:53.200 --> 11:58.720
I think they see the market potential ahead of them for people that are developing services

11:58.720 --> 12:00.680
for the cloud.

12:00.680 --> 12:05.720
And it's a ginormous field for decades to come.

12:05.720 --> 12:11.280
So if a few folks from the 90s can't get over the fact that they won the desktop, which

12:11.280 --> 12:15.760
– raising my hand right here, I was one of them – I think Microsoft will be okay

12:15.760 --> 12:16.760
with that.

12:16.760 --> 12:20.160
Well, just to appease the people who will be annoyed at us talking about them, I did

12:20.160 --> 12:22.720
put M$ sign in the document that we're looking at.

12:22.720 --> 12:23.720
You totally did!

12:23.720 --> 12:25.760
And I wasn't going to out you, either.

12:25.760 --> 12:30.000
I thought that was just going to be our private little joke, because both of us usually kind

12:30.000 --> 12:34.160
of roll our eyes when we see that, but yet when we do it, it's funny.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.680
Exactly.

12:36.680 --> 12:42.960
Well the company who Microsoft has been pretty cozy with over the last year or so is Canonical.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.760
And they've had a pretty good year.

12:44.760 --> 12:45.760
Seems so.

12:45.760 --> 12:46.760
It seems so.

12:46.760 --> 12:50.200
And that coziness actually seems like it's ramped up a little bit, too, as they each

12:50.200 --> 12:52.880
find business opportunities to do so.

12:52.880 --> 12:56.180
But Canonical themselves had a strong year.

12:56.180 --> 12:59.920
Really good releases and some good partnerships.

12:59.920 --> 13:04.060
And they've pushed the edge in a few areas with the 1910 release, which I think a lot

13:04.060 --> 13:05.560
of us can appreciate.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.560
But even that 1904 release was really solid.

13:08.560 --> 13:11.400
If only so you had the excuse to play your disco duck song.

13:11.400 --> 13:15.160
Yeah, I did love that disco duck opportunity.

13:15.160 --> 13:16.760
Once in a lifetime, that one.

13:16.760 --> 13:22.400
Yeah, it's funny, this was the beginning, or maybe midway point, of a narrative about

13:22.400 --> 13:24.640
GNOME Shell.

13:24.640 --> 13:30.020
Memory enhancements, CPU optimization, animation tweaks that make it faster, all of these things

13:30.020 --> 13:35.120
were combining to make it a great desktop experience, which turned out to be even more

13:35.120 --> 13:36.400
so in 1910.

13:36.400 --> 13:40.760
But that's where we really saw a lot of these land initially was in disco dingo, as well

13:40.760 --> 13:48.920
as support for the option to install NVIDIA graphics at installation time, which was nice

13:48.920 --> 13:50.340
for some of us.

13:50.340 --> 13:51.340
It wasn't all good, though.

13:51.340 --> 13:57.680
There was a bit of a controversy over the 32 bit x86 packages, which happened over a

13:57.680 --> 13:59.440
weekend if I recall correctly.

13:59.440 --> 14:05.280
Oh, yes, the apocalypse of 32 bit support, right.

14:05.280 --> 14:09.440
And remember how that Valve developer took to Twitter and got super upset and said, Oh,

14:09.440 --> 14:11.600
I'm not making Steam for Ubuntu anymore.

14:11.600 --> 14:17.120
Yeah, because at first, Canonical said they were going to completely drop i386 support.

14:17.120 --> 14:20.800
But then after the backlash, they kind of backed down on it.

14:20.800 --> 14:25.680
And now they're saying that they're going to support a few key libraries and binaries

14:25.680 --> 14:28.920
to make things like Wine and Steam work.

14:28.920 --> 14:33.960
Interestingly enough, after this compromise decision was made, even in the last week or

14:33.960 --> 14:39.600
so, there has been increased conversation upstream in the kernel and other packages

14:39.600 --> 14:42.080
about 32 bit support.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.000
Because here's the situation.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.480
And this is not from me.

14:45.480 --> 14:46.480
This is from these developers.

14:46.480 --> 14:52.620
Of course, I'm kind of summarizing, but my interpretation of it is they can make these

14:52.620 --> 14:58.640
things build for 32 bit, but people are not fixing people are not patching and people

14:58.640 --> 15:04.120
are not testing if they are getting fixed and patched at all for a lot of 32 bit code.

15:04.120 --> 15:10.440
So now outside of the Ubuntu project, there is more and more pressure building on maintaining

15:10.440 --> 15:13.840
32 bit and and making that call making that break.

15:13.840 --> 15:17.040
Well, it's perfectly understandable why that pressure is growing.

15:17.040 --> 15:22.720
I specifically put some 32 bit hardware to the test this year.

15:22.720 --> 15:26.520
And honestly, it's just useless at this point.

15:26.520 --> 15:31.720
There's I can't see any justification for using 32 bit x86 anymore.

15:31.720 --> 15:32.720
Wow.

15:32.720 --> 15:33.720
Wow.

15:33.720 --> 15:36.640
I mean, if that's coming from XFC Joe.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.720
Well, yeah, exactly.

15:39.720 --> 15:46.760
Considering that you have these arm boards now, if you want something to run as a server,

15:46.760 --> 15:52.440
that's relatively low power, it just doesn't make sense to use old 32 bit x86 anymore.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.200
Yeah, there's likely a lot more testing on that arm code.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.040
Oh, yeah, exactly.

15:57.040 --> 16:02.640
canonical also saw their director of engineering for the Ubuntu desktop will cook, step down,

16:02.640 --> 16:07.200
and Martin Wimpress stepping into that position, as well as expanding it to include several

16:07.200 --> 16:08.200
other areas.

16:08.200 --> 16:12.280
I think that will really went out on a high with the Ubuntu 1910 release, he's very keen

16:12.280 --> 16:14.160
to say that it's a team effort.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.940
But that was a great interim release.

16:16.940 --> 16:21.600
And now impressed has got to deal with this 20 or four, which is a huge release for canonical,

16:21.600 --> 16:26.340
no matter which way you look at it, it's going to be supported for 10 years.

16:26.340 --> 16:30.440
Him and his team have to get this right, which I'm sure they will because they're building

16:30.440 --> 16:34.080
on 1904 and 1910, which were both solid.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.240
So I've got full confidence in him.

16:36.240 --> 16:43.600
And coming in just towards the very end of the year, Ubuntu Pro launched on the AWS marketplace.

16:43.600 --> 16:48.120
And I mentioned this because wouldn't it be interesting in 2020 if this expanded into

16:48.120 --> 16:50.680
other providers and maybe even on premises?

16:50.680 --> 16:52.240
I think that's pretty likely.

16:52.240 --> 16:56.280
I don't think that needs to go in the prediction show somehow.

16:56.280 --> 17:00.400
But something that could have gone in the prediction show is canonical IPOing, which

17:00.400 --> 17:03.600
I've threatened on previous episodes put in, but I'm not going to.

17:03.600 --> 17:07.880
So I'll say it now, I think that 2020 is going to be the year that they're going to announce

17:07.880 --> 17:11.720
that it probably won't happen, because it takes a lot of time to get it all together.

17:11.720 --> 17:16.320
But it feels like the ducks are in a row, and they're getting more and more so.

17:16.320 --> 17:20.640
And we're heading towards that point where it's going to happen.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.680
I guess I have to take the opposite side of that bet.

17:22.680 --> 17:28.520
I'll take that opposite side and I'll say, no IPO, they may announce funding, but no

17:28.520 --> 17:29.520
IPO.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.720
You might be right because these things do take a lot of time.

17:31.720 --> 17:32.720
Yeah, I don't know, though.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.760
It feels like we've been building up to it for the last two years.

17:34.760 --> 17:38.680
Yeah, but that kind of business stuff takes a long time, doesn't it?

17:38.680 --> 17:39.680
True, true.

17:39.680 --> 17:42.880
Well, I'm taking the other side because there's really only two sides to that bet.

17:42.880 --> 17:47.240
Well, there's the third possibility that someone could buy them.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.240
True.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.880
But then what would Mark do with all his free time?

17:49.880 --> 17:50.880
I don't think so.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.880
I think he's in it to win it.

17:52.880 --> 17:53.880
Maybe, maybe.

17:53.880 --> 17:58.200
It also has been very interesting to watch Red Hat this year.

17:58.200 --> 18:03.360
I had my first opportunity to go to a Red Hat summit, and it happened to be the Red

18:03.360 --> 18:05.880
Hat summit where RHEL 8 was released.

18:05.880 --> 18:11.520
Which has been a very well-received release, and quite the change from RHEL 7, it's almost

18:11.520 --> 18:14.800
like the whole industry has changed between 7 and 8.

18:14.800 --> 18:18.200
And they've really incorporated all those changes into it.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.200
Yeah, that's it.

18:19.200 --> 18:26.260
It was a very palpable sensation at Red Hat summit that this release really was a recognition

18:26.260 --> 18:30.100
of how much it changed since the last RHEL, and they really were trying to message that

18:30.100 --> 18:31.860
very clearly.

18:31.860 --> 18:35.920
And this was all happening in the shadow of the IBM acquisition that hadn't completely

18:35.920 --> 18:41.940
closed yet, and with them nearly reaching the $3 billion revenue mark, which they ended

18:41.940 --> 18:43.840
up actually hitting later in the year.

18:43.840 --> 18:48.040
Yeah, and what was interesting about that $3 billion is how small that was compared

18:48.040 --> 18:49.040
with IBM.

18:49.040 --> 18:54.740
Of course, with that IBM acquisition, we weren't really sure what the state of CentOS was.

18:54.740 --> 19:02.420
There was a strange kind of weird delay for CentOS 8, and then we woke up one morning,

19:02.420 --> 19:06.480
and not only had CentOS 8 landed, but a new beast had been released.

19:06.480 --> 19:11.680
Yeah, CentOS Stream, the rolling version of CentOS, which suddenly explained why there

19:11.680 --> 19:15.480
was a delay to releasing CentOS 8 in the first place.

19:15.480 --> 19:20.000
People were really starting to scratch their heads wondering where it was, and then suddenly

19:20.000 --> 19:23.520
8 and Stream come along, and we're like, ah, that's why there was a delay.

19:23.520 --> 19:24.760
Yeah, it's pretty interesting.

19:24.760 --> 19:29.520
I haven't played with it a bunch, just a little bit, but it does have a lot of potential to

19:29.520 --> 19:35.840
get changes upstreamed into RHEL in a much more direct kind of pipeline, which I'll be

19:35.840 --> 19:37.680
digging into more in 2020.

19:37.680 --> 19:44.680
We also saw Fedora 31 ship, which included a very polished and well-performing version

19:44.680 --> 19:45.680
of Gnome Shell.

19:45.680 --> 19:49.360
Yeah, and that was off the back of Fedora 30, which was also released.

19:49.360 --> 19:56.320
Two very solid releases, not massively exciting, but I suppose that's kind of not what you

19:56.320 --> 19:57.320
want from Fedora.

19:57.320 --> 20:01.800
You want just stability and something that's just going to work for you.

20:01.800 --> 20:07.000
Nice and steady improvements, yeah, that is the nice Fedora recipe.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.760
I also feel like just while we're talking about distros, I kind of need to give an honorable

20:10.760 --> 20:18.520
mention to both Manjaro and PopOS, which saw a lot of coverage in the YouTube space, and

20:18.520 --> 20:22.720
Manjaro had a deal cut with the free office folks.

20:22.720 --> 20:26.920
There's a new kind of leveling up for them with their business formation as well, so

20:26.920 --> 20:32.400
it's been a good year for those distributions, and elementary OS saw a series of steady faster

20:32.400 --> 20:38.040
releases for their distribution, so more features came to the later releases than typically

20:38.040 --> 20:39.040
we saw in the past.

20:39.040 --> 20:45.000
And of course, we saw the end of Antigos this year, but then rising from the ashes of it

20:45.000 --> 20:50.680
was Endeavor OS, which I've been really impressed with, and I think is now my go-to for installing

20:50.680 --> 20:55.080
Arch because it's just so easy and simple, and it's got a great XFCE implementation,

20:55.080 --> 20:57.000
which is always going to keep me happy.

20:57.000 --> 21:03.560
And it's really been something for me personally to watch the explosion of community around

21:03.560 --> 21:05.280
the Home Assistant project.

21:05.280 --> 21:11.640
The home automation software I use, it's now in the top 10 on GitHub of all projects,

21:11.640 --> 21:16.200
and the community has just exponentially grown this year.

21:16.200 --> 21:22.580
It's really been neat to see the project hit its stride and watch the maintainers still

21:22.580 --> 21:27.360
interact with the community, do live streams, ask questions, see them grow.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.780
They recently hired another member.

21:29.780 --> 21:33.980
It's been a heck of a year for the Home Assistant project.

21:33.980 --> 21:39.460
But there is one category that's a bit absent, and that's mobile.

21:39.460 --> 21:42.660
We don't really have a massive update.

21:42.660 --> 21:48.020
We have a lot of really solid progress, and we're very close to breaking to what I would

21:48.020 --> 21:54.140
call big updates, like shipping hardware and whatnot, but we're not quite there, are we?

21:54.140 --> 21:55.300
We're not really there.

21:55.300 --> 22:01.840
We did see UbiPorts finally create their foundation and gain some legitimacy there, and finally

22:01.840 --> 22:04.160
get their business sorted out.

22:04.160 --> 22:09.940
And we've seen really good improvements with post-market OS, and the PinePhone, which is

22:09.940 --> 22:15.540
almost shipping, and the prototypes and dev kits for that are running pretty solidly,

22:15.540 --> 22:20.020
and make phone calls, but we're just not quite there.

22:20.020 --> 22:25.180
Feels like 2020 could be a year that we see some serious progress on that front.

22:25.180 --> 22:30.740
I think that what's important is to understand that it's very unlikely that a proper GNU

22:30.740 --> 22:35.020
slash Linux phone is going to take on Android and iOS.

22:35.020 --> 22:41.100
But I think that we will see in 2020 a big niche being filled there, and it only takes

22:41.100 --> 22:45.580
a fraction of the whole market to make it worthwhile.

22:45.580 --> 22:51.220
A few hundred thousand people running a GNU slash Linux phone is still pretty cool.

22:51.220 --> 22:53.940
Yeah, look at the small board computer market.

22:53.940 --> 22:59.420
It's a sustainable market for hobbyists and people that are learning and developing.

22:59.420 --> 23:06.100
So I absolutely could see a Linux phone market serving a similar niche to that.

23:06.100 --> 23:10.440
There's so many categories that we could talk about in an episode like this that this could

23:10.440 --> 23:15.360
be a four-part series, it could be a four-hour episode, but I wouldn't mind including just

23:15.360 --> 23:16.880
one honorable mention for myself.

23:16.880 --> 23:25.420
I am so freaking satisfied with Linux gaming between Proton, native ports, Stadia.

23:25.420 --> 23:26.880
I'm good to go.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.940
There's literally not a game I can't play right now.

23:28.940 --> 23:33.520
I don't play all the games, but every time I've gone to play any single game that has

23:33.520 --> 23:37.720
crossed my fancy, I've been able to play it in 2019.

23:37.720 --> 23:42.660
It's like getting email from an exchange server level cool kind of stuff for me.

23:42.660 --> 23:45.620
That was the untapped territory.

23:45.620 --> 23:54.100
I can fire up Star Trek Online anytime I want on Linux, or Truck Simulator, yes, Truck Simulator.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.100
It's the whole range, Joe.

23:55.100 --> 23:59.500
You need to get Euro Truck Simulator and drive around London, see how you like driving on

23:59.500 --> 24:00.500
the wrong side of the road.

24:00.500 --> 24:05.420
I think it would drive me crazy and crash my RV next time I took it out on the road.

24:05.420 --> 24:11.140
Well, like I said, we could go on forever, and we have to wrap up because next week it

24:11.140 --> 24:16.900
is our predictions episode, so go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new

24:16.900 --> 24:17.900

24:21.300 --> 24:22.380
We'll be back next week.

24:22.380 --> 24:24.540
I am at Chris LAS.

24:24.540 --> 24:26.180
I'm at Joe Wessington.

24:26.180 --> 24:29.020
Thanks for joining us, and we'll see you next year.

24:29.020 --> 24:38.180
I'll see you later.

24:38.180 --> 24:39.900
Bye-bye.

24:39.900 --> 24:42.220
Take care.

24:42.220 --> 24:44.620
Take care.

24:44.620 --> 24:46.620
You
