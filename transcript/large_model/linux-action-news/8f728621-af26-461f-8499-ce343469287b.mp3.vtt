00:00.000 --> 00:16.240
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open-source world.

00:16.240 --> 00:20.920
This is episode 17, recorded on September 3rd, 2017.

00:20.920 --> 00:21.920
I'm Chris.

00:21.920 --> 00:22.920
And I'm Tor.

00:22.920 --> 00:23.920
Hello, Joe.

00:23.920 --> 00:27.440
You know, often the saying goes, where there's smoke, there's fire.

00:27.440 --> 00:32.040
And apparently, there's a little bit of fire in New York, because an Ubuntu rally is in

00:32.040 --> 00:36.860
the works, taking place in New York City, September 25th through the 29th.

00:36.860 --> 00:39.360
And it looks like it could be quite the festival.

00:39.360 --> 00:44.780
Yeah, I had heard about this on the grapevine, but now it's all official.

00:44.780 --> 00:51.960
It's basically an excuse to get people together to work on snaps and GNOME, by the looks of

00:51.960 --> 00:52.960
things.

00:52.960 --> 00:57.620
They're inviting all sorts of people, and rumor has it, paying for all sorts of people

00:57.620 --> 01:00.100
to go there and take part in this.

01:00.100 --> 01:04.680
Very much like the last one that they had in London about a year ago, was it?

01:04.680 --> 01:11.400
Yeah, they seem to be targeting application developers, IoT device manufacturers, and

01:11.400 --> 01:17.480
PC OEMs who want to help set future direction goals in Ubuntu, or enable Ubuntu on their

01:17.480 --> 01:18.480
hardware.

01:18.480 --> 01:22.160
And also then a call out to active and passionate community members as well.

01:22.160 --> 01:26.880
I take this as sort of the beginnings of a kind of a big canonical event.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.920
And it's really downtown in New York City.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.000
I think it's like at one of the Hyatt hotels there.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.360
There's information in the show notes and also on the Ubuntu insights blog.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.520
Are you going to make it, Joe?

01:36.520 --> 01:37.880
No, unfortunately.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.080
But my friend Ike is, by the looks of things.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.080
Yeah, yeah.

01:41.080 --> 01:44.400
Quite a few folks that we mentioned often on the show are going to be there.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.640
And I'm going to try to make it myself.

01:45.640 --> 01:46.640
I don't know how.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.400
I'm doing all the travel math right now.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.360
And you and I, of course, are going to have to figure out recording math, but I'm going

01:52.360 --> 01:53.360
to try to make it.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.680
I'm going to try to get there.

01:54.680 --> 01:57.000
And I think this is going to be a big event.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.360
There is a lot of momentum in different directions around Ubuntu 17.10, big changes around canonical.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.440
And with Mark Shuttle, we're sort of taking the reins again.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.600
And he's going to be really rallying this event, this Ubuntu rally.

02:08.600 --> 02:09.640
I want to see that.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.920
I want to come back, and I want to report on it for the show.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.120
So I think I'm going to try to make it.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.280
Well, that would be awesome if you could get there.

02:15.280 --> 02:16.720
It's a long way away, though, isn't it?

02:16.720 --> 02:17.720
Yeah.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.720
It's a long way away.

02:18.720 --> 02:21.760
And the timing and budget is not so lining up at the moment.

02:21.760 --> 02:22.920
That's sort of a nice way to say it.

02:22.920 --> 02:29.080
So I may end up just loading up in my truck and sleeping in my truck and just driving

02:29.080 --> 02:33.080
there and grinding it out and then just figuring out where I'm going to stay and how I'm going

02:33.080 --> 02:34.440
to make that work when I get there.

02:34.440 --> 02:39.080
You probably know enough people across the US to kind of stay on some couches or something.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.080
Maybe.

02:40.080 --> 02:41.600
This is the first time I'm saying anything publicly about it.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.480
So if anybody's going to be around the area of this event, maybe hit me up on Twitter

02:45.480 --> 02:49.680
or Telegram at Chris Ellis, and let me know if you've got a couch available for me and

02:49.680 --> 02:52.160
my lady because, yeah, we're going to pile in there and head out.

02:52.160 --> 02:56.880
And I'm going to put feelers out there for other folks within JB and see if they want

02:56.880 --> 02:57.880
to go.

02:57.880 --> 03:02.080
But right now, it's just the early stages of sort of a crazy plan because I think it's

03:02.080 --> 03:04.000
going to be worth going.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Yeah, definitely.

03:06.000 --> 03:12.520
So 1710, speaking of Ubuntu, the beta 1 has come out, but not of the main flavor of Ubuntu

03:12.520 --> 03:14.760
because they don't participate in beta 1.

03:14.760 --> 03:24.280
So it's a lot of the flavors, Ubuntu Mate, Ubuntu Chillin, Lubuntu, Ubuntu Studio.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.200
So it's our first glance.

03:26.200 --> 03:30.280
When I first heard about it, I was quite excited because I thought it was going to be a milestone

03:30.280 --> 03:31.560
for the main version.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.700
But it looks like we're going to have to wait a little while for beta 2.

03:34.700 --> 03:39.600
But looking at some of these flavors, specifically, the most interesting to me is actually Ubuntu

03:39.600 --> 03:43.360
Chillin, which is spelled Kailin, but it's pronounced Chillin.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.400
And that looks like Windows.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.560
They've basically taken Mate and made it look like Windows.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.540
And this is for the Chinese market.

03:50.540 --> 03:55.120
So it's not a huge surprise, is it, that they wanted to make it look like Windows?

03:55.120 --> 03:56.120
Indeed.

03:56.120 --> 04:01.660
Looking at this 1710 release, when you consider Ubuntu Chillin and the work that the Ubuntu

04:01.660 --> 04:06.640
Mate project has been doing, that flavor, with their new heads up display, the improved

04:06.640 --> 04:11.520
Super Key support that really nails it now, global menu improvements, and really getting

04:11.520 --> 04:19.840
a pretty spot on implementation of Unity called Mutiny, this is all going to draw more and

04:19.840 --> 04:21.640
more attention to this project.

04:21.640 --> 04:29.960
I think Ubuntu 1710, the Chillin and Ubuntu Mate flavors, are representing sort of a milestone

04:29.960 --> 04:34.980
for the Mate project, a milestone that is easy to miss.

04:34.980 --> 04:40.720
But if you think about it, really indicates that this traditional desktop paradigm has

04:40.720 --> 04:42.420
gotten traction.

04:42.420 --> 04:44.440
And there's people using it.

04:44.440 --> 04:50.300
And it is actually possible to take this traditional desktop paradigm and move it into modern computing.

04:50.300 --> 04:52.280
And both these projects are bearing that out.

04:52.280 --> 04:56.320
Yeah, not to mention Plasma 5 that's been trucking along with the traditional desktop

04:56.320 --> 04:57.600
for years now.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.600
Indeed, indeed, indeed.

04:58.600 --> 05:04.480
In fact, speaking of the Plasma 5 release, Ubuntu 1710 will have KDE Plasma 5.10 and

05:04.480 --> 05:06.780
will use Xorg by default.

05:06.780 --> 05:08.640
Some of these flavors will be using Wayland.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.340
This is an interesting division throughout Ubuntu now.

05:11.340 --> 05:14.520
You'll have Ubuntu proper 1710 using Wayland by default.

05:14.520 --> 05:18.320
But some flavors, like Kubuntu, will be using Xorg.

05:18.320 --> 05:24.280
Yeah, and the XFCE version, Zubuntu, which is what I use, that just looks exactly the

05:24.280 --> 05:25.280
same.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.280
It's funny.

05:26.280 --> 05:27.280
That's what I like, though.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.280
Just how you like it, right, Joe?

05:28.280 --> 05:29.280
Yeah.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.280
Yeah, exactly.

05:30.280 --> 05:32.800
Why change for its own sake, you know?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.000
Yeah, why change at all?

05:34.000 --> 05:39.080
Of course, Reddit's making big changes, and the headline change for our audience is not

05:39.080 --> 05:40.760
so much more with the open source.

05:40.760 --> 05:46.760
I mean, individual components, but you know, sort of that big core component, not so much.

05:46.760 --> 05:52.520
Yeah, which is a shame, but the reality is that it hasn't been properly open source for

05:52.520 --> 05:53.520
a long time.

05:53.520 --> 06:00.140
They've been very bad with the commits and keeping it all up to date on GitHub.

06:00.140 --> 06:05.640
And so really, they're just formalizing their position, saying that they basically can't

06:05.640 --> 06:12.760
be open source for numerous reasons, which are a little bit spurious, really, I think.

06:12.760 --> 06:14.000
Yeah, I agree.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.680
They say that it makes it hard for them to develop some features in the clear, like the

06:17.680 --> 06:19.240
recent video launch.

06:19.240 --> 06:24.520
Well, that doesn't mean that you can't do that Google style and throw it over the wall

06:24.520 --> 06:25.520
when it's finished.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.520
Yeah, exactly.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.880
And they say, look, you know, we're big now.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.280
People know about Reddit.

06:30.280 --> 06:35.320
We're a player on the web, so it's hard for us to be strategic in our planning when everyone

06:35.320 --> 06:39.100
can see the code we're committing.

06:39.100 --> 06:42.840
That's got to be some weak of the weakest sauce right there.

06:42.840 --> 06:46.160
There are so many ways around that, and that's their number one feature.

06:46.160 --> 06:50.500
Now, here's a part I do understand, and this is their second bullet point.

06:50.500 --> 06:54.680
Because of the above, our internal development production and feature branches have been

06:54.680 --> 07:00.480
moving further and further from canonical state of the open source repository.

07:00.480 --> 07:05.880
Such balkanization means that merges are getting increasingly difficult, especially as the

07:05.880 --> 07:11.760
company grows and more developers are touching the code more frequently.

07:11.760 --> 07:15.800
That is a legitimate point there, especially if you are trying to be less and less open

07:15.800 --> 07:16.800
source.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.920
Well, yeah, it's funny that they say they basically only open sourced it in the first

07:20.920 --> 07:26.240
place because they knew they were a small company, and they could go bust or whatever,

07:26.240 --> 07:30.720
and they wanted to have it out there for the community should the community need to step

07:30.720 --> 07:32.000
up and take it off them.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.020
But now they're basically saying, oh, we're safe now.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.020
We've got our business model.

07:35.020 --> 07:36.200
We've been around long enough.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.520
We don't need to be open source.

07:37.520 --> 07:38.520
And it's really disappointing.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.400
What do you think about this argument?

07:40.400 --> 07:42.480
Because I could see this coming up more and more.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.440
This could be a way of the future here.

07:44.440 --> 07:50.140
They write, as we move towards a more service oriented architecture, Reddit is being divided

07:50.140 --> 07:55.760
into many smaller repositories that are under active development.

07:55.760 --> 08:00.400
So it's sort of this we're rebuilding Reddit in individual components.

08:00.400 --> 08:06.200
And as we do that, we're not really rewriting them as open source components.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.600
But why not?

08:07.600 --> 08:10.480
Why not just make them open source?

08:10.480 --> 08:13.160
It just seems like a lot of very spurious arguments here.

08:13.160 --> 08:17.760
I could see these last two arguments being used by other open source projects that want

08:17.760 --> 08:18.760
to go closed source.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.680
But they point out that they still believe, these are the terminologies they actually

08:21.680 --> 08:23.400
use, we believe in open source.

08:23.400 --> 08:26.840
And we want to make sure that our contributions are both useful and meaningful.

08:26.840 --> 08:31.800
So we'll continue to open source tools that are of use to engineers everywhere.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.440
And they include a couple of examples.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.760
It's funny that turn of phrase, isn't it?

08:34.760 --> 08:35.760
They believe in open source.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.600
Yeah, they literally believe it exists.

08:37.600 --> 08:41.200
Well, that doesn't really help if you're code proprietary, does it?

08:41.200 --> 08:42.480
I believe in gravity, Joe.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.880
I'm a strong believer in gravity.

08:44.880 --> 08:48.840
Yeah, well, Reddit's just toxic anyway, isn't it?

08:48.840 --> 08:49.840
That is true.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.480
You know, really, perhaps it's time for something new to come along.

08:52.480 --> 08:55.120
Because it's overall, it's a dumpster fire.

08:55.120 --> 08:59.880
And what we really need, perhaps, is a petition, a change.org petition for the people.

08:59.880 --> 09:03.200
Yeah, because petitions always succeed in their goals, don't they?

09:03.200 --> 09:04.200
Yeah.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.200
Well, this one actually did.

09:05.200 --> 09:10.280
A petition that was started by a community member of Phoenix OS, which we've talked about

09:10.280 --> 09:16.240
in the past on this show, launched a change.org petition to open source the kernel of Phoenix

09:16.240 --> 09:17.520
OS.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.520
But in this circumstance, it actually made a difference.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.640
Yeah, so they were violating the GPL before.

09:23.640 --> 09:29.120
And now they've released what looks like it's probably all of the source code, but we're

09:29.120 --> 09:30.880
not 100% sure, are we?

09:30.880 --> 09:32.480
Yeah, they're still trying to verify it.

09:32.480 --> 09:35.320
So it seems like there's been an effort for the last couple of days.

09:35.320 --> 09:36.720
I went all in on this, Joe.

09:36.720 --> 09:37.720
I read facts.

09:37.720 --> 09:40.560
I got involved in the Discord comments and community.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.520
I spoke to one of the developers.

09:42.520 --> 09:47.360
And there was this weird two-day period where they attempted to verify the source code.

09:47.360 --> 09:51.400
I'm not sure why it took so long, but somebody came along and offered their services and

09:51.400 --> 09:56.320
did at least verify that there are deviations from upstream Android kernel source.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.600
OK, so it's probably the kernel from Phoenix OS then.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.600
Yeah.

10:00.600 --> 10:04.920
It sounds like there's more work to be done, including making it possible for the community

10:04.920 --> 10:05.920
interact and all of this.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.400
So there's still more work to be done.

10:07.400 --> 10:12.960
The change.org petition has been updated now to reflect that things are still outstanding.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.080
Yeah.

10:14.080 --> 10:19.780
And Phoenix OS is kind of the last man standing, isn't it, in terms of desktop Android?

10:19.780 --> 10:21.120
That's why this matters.

10:21.120 --> 10:26.200
And it is actually, as far as open source and Android is concerned, a fairly important

10:26.200 --> 10:27.200
story.

10:27.200 --> 10:31.320
And there's more to be done with Phoenix OS, including a ton of work on graphics cards

10:31.320 --> 10:33.200
and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

10:33.200 --> 10:38.080
So there's a ton of area here where the open source community could really contribute and

10:38.080 --> 10:39.320
make this thing more viable.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.320
Yeah.

10:40.320 --> 10:44.280
And I'd like to see it more international because it feels very Eastern at the moment.

10:44.280 --> 10:48.960
It's very kind of Chinese-focused with the apps that you've got pre-installed and stuff

10:48.960 --> 10:49.960
in it.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.720
It just doesn't feel like it's for me as a Westerner.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.720
Yeah.

10:52.720 --> 10:57.560
I could see maybe bringing in the open source community as a way of resolving that as well.

10:57.560 --> 11:01.860
But back to regular Android handsets, those of us that will just be using stock Android

11:01.860 --> 11:04.160
may have a bit of a better time.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.440
We've been stuck with old versions of kernels.

11:06.440 --> 11:11.400
Google has never really cared what version of the kernel an OEM uses, as long as everything

11:11.400 --> 11:12.400
works.

11:12.400 --> 11:13.400
Yeah.

11:13.400 --> 11:20.360
But now they're going to mandate 4.4 or later, which is quite a big jump because even my

11:20.360 --> 11:26.520
OnePlus 3T running the latest lineage, 14.1, which is based on Android 7.1.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.400
So I suppose it's not quite the latest.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.920
But that is running a 3.18 kernel.

11:30.920 --> 11:32.240
Mm.

11:32.240 --> 11:33.720
Which is, that's ancient.

11:33.720 --> 11:34.720
Yeah.

11:34.720 --> 11:41.080
Well, starting now, Google is going to require, if you use Oreo, that your system on a chip

11:41.080 --> 11:44.960
has to support a 4.4 kernel or newer, and you have to ship that.

11:44.960 --> 11:48.880
And the really slick thing about that is, and this is going to have long-term actual

11:48.880 --> 11:54.160
ramifications here as people start to roll this out, Project Treble is built into this

11:54.160 --> 11:58.720
version of Android, which means it's going to be easier to upgrade that kernel down the

11:58.720 --> 11:59.720
road.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.480
And this is a major news story for Android.

12:02.480 --> 12:08.500
Once we get people on this baseline version of Android, and on this baseline kernel 4.4

12:08.500 --> 12:14.720
or newer, we will be starting a path towards an x86-style ability to update your kernel

12:14.720 --> 12:17.400
on your phone whenever there's an update coming up.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.160
And that's going to be a game changer for Android.

12:20.160 --> 12:26.000
I don't know if it's quite that level of x86, but it's certainly a damn sight better than

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
it is at the moment.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
You're right.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.800
And I'm going to overstate it because it's going to be a multi-year process to get there.

12:31.800 --> 12:36.960
Because just getting handsets on a kernel 4.4 is going to take years.

12:36.960 --> 12:41.240
Then there's going to be a transition period where OEMs start to wake up to the reality

12:41.240 --> 12:45.480
that they can now swap out individual layers of Android without having to worry about breaking

12:45.480 --> 12:46.940
their driver support.

12:46.940 --> 12:51.200
Once that clicks in and they've updated their development process, then Android handsets

12:51.200 --> 12:52.200
will start to benefit.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.920
But that's years, Joe.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.680
Well, they needed to do this, didn't they, Google?

12:56.680 --> 12:59.960
The whole update thing, we've been talking about for years.

12:59.960 --> 13:03.880
It's just broken, fundamentally broken, the way updates work on Android.

13:03.880 --> 13:11.600
The fact that you've got people running version 4 and stuff, it's just absolutely ridiculous.

13:11.600 --> 13:16.800
Whereas if you look at the other side of the fence with Apple, even six, seven-year-old

13:16.800 --> 13:21.160
iPhones are running maybe one or two versions behind at most.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.880
So it needed to happen.

13:22.880 --> 13:27.920
And it's good to see that Google have finally made the changes that they need to make.

13:27.920 --> 13:34.200
And it's going to take a while, but at least we'll get there.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.000
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.280
Go there to support the show, but also sign up for a free seven-day trial of a platform

13:40.280 --> 13:44.760
designed to teach you everything about Linux with self-paced, in-depth video courses, hands-on

13:44.760 --> 13:49.480
scenario-based labs, full-time human instructors that are happy to help when you need them.

13:49.480 --> 13:54.080
And one of the things that I'm really appreciative of Linux Academy, you choose your Linux distribution

13:54.080 --> 13:57.920
that adjusts the courseware and the virtual machines that they spin up on demand.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.920
They all match.

13:58.920 --> 14:02.600
So Debian or Red Hat, whatever is perfect for your work environment.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.600
That's genius.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.720
That's something that only a platform built by Linux enthusiasts would do.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.040
They have practice exams that prepare you for certs.

14:09.040 --> 14:12.680
They also have courseware that's really designed to focus on certifications, if that's your

14:12.680 --> 14:13.680
current goal.

14:13.680 --> 14:17.960
Or if you want to move into a new career track, they have learning paths for that as well.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.960
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

14:19.960 --> 14:25.200
Go there to support this show and sign up for a free trial for seven days.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.400
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

14:28.400 --> 14:34.460
Okay, let's talk about the essential phone.

14:34.460 --> 14:39.120
So Andy Rubin, the father of Android, announced this a few months ago and there was a lot

14:39.120 --> 14:41.140
of hype about it.

14:41.140 --> 14:47.760
And it has failed to deliver so far on many different levels.

14:47.760 --> 14:51.200
The first is that he promised it would ship within 30 days.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.320
And this was at the end of May.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.000
So that means by the end of June.

14:55.000 --> 15:00.520
And here we are in September, and it's only just about starting to ship now.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.480
And then they made promises that it would be within a week.

15:03.480 --> 15:07.760
And it just they keep letting us down, which is kind of understandable for a startup.

15:07.760 --> 15:11.540
And you know, I'm not going to be too harsh on them for that.

15:11.540 --> 15:16.440
But then this week, they just royally screwed up.

15:16.440 --> 15:20.080
They managed to somehow send everyone's information to everyone.

15:20.080 --> 15:24.280
What appears to have happened is that essential had a list of customers that needed to verify

15:24.280 --> 15:26.620
to prevent fraud for orders.

15:26.620 --> 15:29.220
So it sent them an email requesting more information.

15:29.220 --> 15:35.440
But that email address was set up as a group email, which meant that replies sent to it

15:35.440 --> 15:38.440
were then sent to everybody on the mailing list.

15:38.440 --> 15:44.060
It was a misconfigured customer support address on their Zendesk system, which is a customer

15:44.060 --> 15:45.640
service portal.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.200
And you know, it's one of those things when you're a new company, and you've never used

15:48.200 --> 15:49.920
it in production.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.200
These things happen.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.160
And it's really embarrassing.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.080
Yeah, that is really embarrassing.

15:55.080 --> 15:59.800
I mean, where do you stand on them failing to deliver the actual phones, though?

15:59.800 --> 16:02.280
delays in shipping are understandable.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.820
This one may be fatal.

16:03.820 --> 16:09.440
This delay has pushed them right up against the new launch of the note eight and the iPhone

16:09.440 --> 16:11.560
eight massive competition.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.220
And this could be a real death blow to the essential phone.

16:14.220 --> 16:19.200
And then you combine it with the early reviews that are not looking particularly positive,

16:19.200 --> 16:22.200
particularly around this camera that's been promoted extensively.

16:22.200 --> 16:25.800
Oh, it turns out Joe phones are hard.

16:25.800 --> 16:30.320
Yeah, it's funny that if only we knew of some other companies that tried to make phones

16:30.320 --> 16:35.520
and push them into the market and disrupt it and failed completely.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.960
The difference here is that he came up with Android in the first place.

16:37.960 --> 16:41.880
So you think that he would know a bit about it, but apparently not.

16:41.880 --> 16:45.560
I mean, I recall being a bit skeptical at the time and saying, there's no way I'd pay

16:45.560 --> 16:46.880
that much for a phone.

16:46.880 --> 16:51.820
And it seems that they've just overhyped the over promised and under delivered.

16:51.820 --> 16:55.160
You've got a situation where it's a first generation phone, maybe they should have been

16:55.160 --> 16:58.760
a bit more, more like OnePlus were about it.

16:58.760 --> 17:03.480
Their first one was all word of mouth, and maybe not the invitation system and stuff.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.080
That was kind of a bit dumb.

17:05.080 --> 17:10.240
But be low key about it first, make sure you get one product out the door that's working.

17:10.240 --> 17:14.520
And we haven't even talked about this 360 degree camera that was touted as one of the

17:14.520 --> 17:15.520
great things about it.

17:15.520 --> 17:19.200
This phone's modular, you can clip on these accessories, well, that camera is nowhere

17:19.200 --> 17:20.280
in sight.

17:20.280 --> 17:24.920
My takeaway from all of this, and it's something that I hope that open source projects can

17:24.920 --> 17:29.840
watch and learn from so they don't make the same mistake, is the talent and the engineering

17:29.840 --> 17:32.300
is a component.

17:32.300 --> 17:37.400
But shipping a phone requires many components, and it requires a well oiled machine underneath

17:37.400 --> 17:38.400
it.

17:38.400 --> 17:42.520
And what's happening here is marketing promises that don't live up to the hype, like the promises

17:42.520 --> 17:47.160
about camera or battery life that aren't living up to the hype, or the shipping dates.

17:47.160 --> 17:50.400
You know, Andy doesn't have direct control over manufacturing deadlines and shipping

17:50.400 --> 17:51.400
dates.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.880
So it's not just good engineering talent.

17:52.880 --> 17:56.680
It's also a really well oiled machine that supports shipping a consumer product like

17:56.680 --> 17:57.680
this.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.360
Yeah, and first generation, you're going to make mistakes.

18:00.360 --> 18:03.640
So they really shouldn't have hyped it as much as they did, but what are you going to

18:03.640 --> 18:04.640
do?

18:04.640 --> 18:05.880
They did.

18:05.880 --> 18:12.680
Speaking of hype, blockchains have all of it these days, and there is big money in the

18:12.680 --> 18:13.680
blockchain business.

18:13.680 --> 18:18.560
Well, there's big money in cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, for example, Ethereum, that sort

18:18.560 --> 18:19.560
of thing.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.640
But there's a lot more to this than meets the eye.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.040
You think blockchain, you think Bitcoin.

18:25.040 --> 18:31.400
But the reality is that big business has been watching this develop and actively taking

18:31.400 --> 18:36.800
part in the development of blockchain technology and has been implementing it in lots of different

18:36.800 --> 18:39.680
ways that have nothing to do with Bitcoin.

18:39.680 --> 18:46.040
Indeed, like initial coin offerings, ICOs, which are essentially investment coins that

18:46.040 --> 18:48.760
people are investing in different technologies.

18:48.760 --> 18:53.440
There's venture capital firms like Sequoia and Anderson Horowitz that are getting into

18:53.440 --> 18:54.440
this.

18:54.440 --> 18:59.480
But you know what's really funny, Joe, is at the core of all of this blockchain hype

18:59.480 --> 19:02.280
is the most boring thing ever.

19:02.280 --> 19:07.840
And I'm sorry to our accountants in the audience, but underneath all of this, it's just a reinnovation

19:07.840 --> 19:09.560
of accounting.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.720
It's an improvement in a major way to accounting.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.000
And that's the big story here.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.520
And they're all just trying to figure it out.

19:16.520 --> 19:22.680
Yeah, and not necessarily just financial accounting, but actual accounting of stock and where it's

19:22.680 --> 19:28.480
moving to and which distribution networks it's going through and at what stage it is

19:28.480 --> 19:29.480
and everything.

19:29.480 --> 19:33.000
It's just documentation of all of the boring bits of a business.

19:33.000 --> 19:37.480
Yeah, a blockchain is a kind of a ledger, a table that businesses could use to track

19:37.480 --> 19:40.960
credits and debts, but also all the things that Joe just mentioned.

19:40.960 --> 19:45.080
And it's not like a standard SQL database.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.240
It's something that's cryptographically verified.

19:47.240 --> 19:52.760
One of the blockchain's distinguishing features is that chains are verified transactions in

19:52.760 --> 19:55.100
a sequence of blocks.

19:55.100 --> 19:57.800
And you can't go back once a block is committed.

19:57.800 --> 20:02.680
So it's in, it's a public ledger, it's been cryptographically verified, it uses complex

20:02.680 --> 20:07.040
verifiable math, so everybody can have faith in the system.

20:07.040 --> 20:12.000
And when properly applied, a blockchain can help assure data integrity, maintain audible

20:12.000 --> 20:19.840
records, and perhaps in some different iterations, render financial contracts into a programmable

20:19.840 --> 20:20.840
software.

20:20.840 --> 20:25.040
A contract is confirmed, it's read on the blockchain, action is immediately taken.

20:25.040 --> 20:29.560
So that when you have something that businesses can share amongst themselves, that is cryptographically

20:29.560 --> 20:34.400
verified, it opens up a huge range of business automation and potentials.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.720
And that's what everybody's rushing towards right now.

20:36.720 --> 20:40.560
You said one key word there, public, which we're used to with Bitcoin and stuff, but

20:40.560 --> 20:42.840
it doesn't necessarily have to be a public ledger.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.560
It can be an internal company ledger.

20:45.560 --> 20:51.600
And I think that's one of the key strengths here, that you can have something that is,

20:51.600 --> 20:55.560
as you say, cryptographically verified, so you can know within your company that it hasn't

20:55.560 --> 20:58.160
been tampered with, it's exactly what it should be.

20:58.160 --> 21:02.720
And it's a permanent record of pretty much anything you want it to be.

21:02.720 --> 21:06.620
And so it's no wonder that these companies are taking advantage of it, because it makes

21:06.620 --> 21:09.400
far more sense than traditional databases.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.640
And that's why you're seeing all kinds of companies jump in, and the Linux Foundation,

21:12.640 --> 21:16.000
which is really trying to legitimize business around the blockchain.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.160
Yeah, hopefully the Linux Foundation's involvement will make sure it all stays open source and

21:21.160 --> 21:24.120
that we can all benefit from it.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.960
But let's end with some positive news, shall we?

21:26.960 --> 21:36.000
And that is that Linux browser market share is above 3% now, 3.37% according to NetApplications.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.200
So we should all have a party for 3.37%.

21:40.200 --> 21:43.420
That's actually pretty cool, 3.37%.

21:43.420 --> 21:47.240
So you might wonder, where do these stats come from and why do you seem to hear about

21:47.240 --> 21:48.880
them from time to time?

21:48.880 --> 21:54.640
NetApplications is a business that resells and white labels their data that they collect,

21:54.640 --> 21:57.800
and they publish it free once a month.

21:57.800 --> 22:01.080
And this kind of creates a news story about once a month.

22:01.080 --> 22:04.800
We've never really covered it because, well, it's never been above 3%.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.280
Now where does the data come from?

22:06.280 --> 22:10.680
They claim they have 40,000 websites that participate.

22:10.680 --> 22:14.600
They take that data, they only count one visit per day, even if you visited, say, a site

22:14.600 --> 22:17.360
a dozen times, they only count you once.

22:17.360 --> 22:20.120
And then they average all out and they get their math.

22:20.120 --> 22:24.000
It's interesting sounding, but when I dug into it, I tried to sign up.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.680
I wanted to pretend like I wanted to participate in the program.

22:26.680 --> 22:31.480
And when I sniffed around, it looked like they actually have more like 19,000 active

22:31.480 --> 22:32.760
participating sites.

22:32.760 --> 22:38.600
The number 40,000 participating websites hasn't changed since 2008, so I'm a little suspicious

22:38.600 --> 22:40.440
of that.

22:40.440 --> 22:45.600
And Apple and Microsoft are clients of theirs, and they've admitted that in the past.

22:45.600 --> 22:51.840
So there could be some bias, but either way, even if it's not a huge selection, at best,

22:51.840 --> 22:55.120
at absolute best, it's 160 million uniques.

22:55.120 --> 22:57.600
That's if you believe their 40,000 number.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.920
But surely you can extrapolate that to some extent.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.160
I agree, and so do they.

23:01.160 --> 23:09.320
In fact, they use data provided by the CIA, I'm not making this up, to consider like trend

23:09.320 --> 23:14.120
information about different areas around the world to take that into consideration.

23:14.120 --> 23:20.640
Historically, they've been really under-representing Asia, and I guess with this new data provided

23:20.640 --> 23:25.440
by the CIA, they're now able to take more of a general accounting.

23:25.440 --> 23:29.720
And so it does seem to be representative of the web, but I actually think it's low.

23:29.720 --> 23:31.720
I think it's a low number.

23:31.720 --> 23:36.960
And one of the challenges that they've had recently is Chrome OS and mobile, and I think

23:36.960 --> 23:39.920
Linux is actually getting significantly under-represented.

23:39.920 --> 23:44.600
But I'll take 3.3%, that's pretty respectable, but I think it's actually low, amazingly.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.800
Well, I think we need to define this.

23:46.800 --> 23:51.580
You say Linux, so Chrome OS has a Linux kernel and Android has a Linux kernel.

23:51.580 --> 23:54.240
Do you specifically mean GNU slash desktop Linux?

23:54.240 --> 23:56.640
I do, because they do separate it out.

23:56.640 --> 24:03.280
Chrome OS has 0.56% according to another site, which is Stack Counter, and they also represent

24:03.280 --> 24:07.360
Chrome OS in net applications market share data.

24:07.360 --> 24:12.120
I do think Linux is under-represented in this data, simply because some of the sites that

24:12.120 --> 24:17.480
they have in their participation program, I don't think really cater to a technical

24:17.480 --> 24:18.480
audience.

24:18.480 --> 24:25.320
They're more average consumer gossipy, entertainment websites, and e-entertainment, and those types

24:25.320 --> 24:31.920
of gossip magazines, and less things like Stack Exchange, Google Groups, Hacker News,

24:31.920 --> 24:32.920
those types of sites.

24:32.920 --> 24:37.600
Surely, it would make more sense if they could get Google, google.com.

24:37.600 --> 24:44.640
That would be a handy general purpose website, or Amazon, or something like that, that everybody

24:44.640 --> 24:45.640
uses.

24:45.640 --> 24:46.640
Yeah.

24:46.640 --> 24:47.640
Yeah.

24:47.640 --> 24:52.080
I think the real answer just has to lie in our hearts, Joe.

24:52.080 --> 24:59.680
Well, 2017 is the year of Linux on a desktop for me, as have the last 10, so that's all

24:59.680 --> 25:00.680
that matters to me.

25:00.680 --> 25:01.680
That's right.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.840
That's a personal year of the Linux desktop.

25:03.840 --> 25:07.800
