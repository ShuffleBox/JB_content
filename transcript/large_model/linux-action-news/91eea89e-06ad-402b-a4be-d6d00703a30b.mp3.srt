00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,160
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News. Episode 262, recorded on October 12, 2022. I'm Chris.

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
And I'm Wes.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,700
Hello, Wes. Let's do the news.

4
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:22,080
We start this week with the release of Plasma 5.26, which has benefited from a significant

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,080
focus on stability.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,720
Yeah, stability, and there is also a lot new in this release, add-ons or plasmoids, widgets,

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,240
whatever you call them. They got a lot of work in this release, from some totally new

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,980
ones to just improving long-standing ones, like the calendar and the clock. And something

9
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,600
that jumped out at me that I think a lot of you are going to like, because I know it's

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,340
one of your favorites, Kate and K-Write have now been spruced up with a fancy new welcome

11
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,200
window that launches if you start the application without any files open.

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,480
Well, we always like to see some bug fixing in these releases, and 5.26 is no slouch in

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:05,640
that category. System settings no longer sometimes crashes when you navigate away from the Thunderbolt

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,800
page. In the Plasma X11 session in particular, if Kwin happens to crash and gets auto-restarted

15
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,060
or you manually restart it, it no longer loses its mappings of windows to activities, which

16
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,960
is a big pain to fix.

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,320
And the team also fixed an issue that could occasionally cause apps like VLC and Firefox

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,440
to stop refreshing after being used for a little while, plus a whole lot more that we'll

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,120
have linked in the show notes.

20
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,400
And it might surprise some of you, but there are folks out there that actually have plasma

21
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,560
hooked up to their TV. It can be pretty handy as a media home and a server all-in-one kind

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,300
of setup. And they've put some serious work in this release for their big screen experience

23
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,040
with two new apps landing, Aurora, which is a web browser designed for the big screen,

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,920
and Plank, an easy to use media player, you guessed it, for the big screen.

25
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,800
I've upgraded my Neon Station that I'm sitting at right now to do the show, and just like

26
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:12,360
so many of these later 5 series plasma releases, the upgrade went super smooth. I kept all

27
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,420
of my settings. It was really no big deal at all. In fact, if I hadn't intentionally

28
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,920
gone to do the update and seen all the packages upgrade, I might not even know I was on the

29
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,280
new version. When you go looking for things, you can find it, but the Neon betas have just

30
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,320
been really smooth for me recently. And I have a sense that when Plasma 526 lands in

31
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,840
distributions out there in the Linux world, people are really going to like this release.

32
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:43,760
Well, you better keep that apt update handy over there, Chris, or really PKCon, I suppose.

33
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,980
Either way, work is beginning right now on Plasma 527, which the project says will be

34
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:58,240
the final feature release in the Plasma 5 series.

35
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,360
Less than just two weeks after Google announced plans to shut down Stadia, its cloud gaming

36
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,280
platform, Google has announced plans for Chromebooks built for cloud gaming platforms.

37
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:17,520
Well, for as much sense as that makes, Google says the Acer Chromebook 516GE, the Asus Chromebook

38
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:25,480
Vive CX55 Flip, and Lenovo's IdeaPad gaming Chromebook all have refresh rates of at least

39
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:34,440
120Hz, displays with up to 1600p resolution, and WiFi 6.

40
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,920
These units, what we used to call laptops, are now called Chromebooks, and they don't

41
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,480
really have any dedicated graphics cards in them per se, and they don't really seem to

42
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,640
be related to the recent efforts we reported on to get Steam working locally on Chromebooks.

43
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,680
Instead, these units are equipped with modern Intel GPUs, so you could play some light gaming,

44
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,400
but clearly the focus is on cloud gaming.

45
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,000
They even emphasize WiFi 6 and quad phonic speakers for cloud gaming.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,080
It's just someone else's cloud gaming.

47
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,480
But some of these might make a great little Linux machine.

48
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,040
That Lenovo IdeaPad in particular, well it starts under 600 bucks.

49
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:25,440
It has a 16 inch 120Hz display, a 12th gen Intel CPU, 512GB of SSD backed storage, 11

50
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,680
hours of battery life, at least under Chrome OS, and it's only 4 pounds.

51
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,160
So if the community could find a quick way to wipe off Chrome OS and load a nice shiny

52
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:46,880
Linux distribution, it might just be a cheap way to snap up a pretty nice rig.

53
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:54,540
Well speaking of mostly acceptable gaming performance, the Intel Arc A770 and the A750

54
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,900
have gone on actual official sale in various global markets this week, with price points

55
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,720
starting around $289 US greenbacks.

56
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,920
Gnir and Asrock have also announced their takes on the Arc graphics cards, though sadly

57
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,040
they're entirely out of stock as we record.

58
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,920
Linux users in particular are pretty excited about this release, because the driver for

59
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:28,100
this discrete GPU is built off Intel's existing open source integrated graphics driver stack.

60
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:32,680
And as we've been reporting over the recent years, well there's been a lot of refactoring

61
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,520
there to introduce the concept of discrete video memory and other features that you really

62
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,880
only have to think about with a discrete GPU.

63
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,540
Yeah, and Intel has been slowly but steadily building out the support at Linux for this,

64
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,160
and I love seeing that.

65
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,120
A free software driver stack for the video is just massive for Linux, but they're competing

66
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
on price here too.

67
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,480
The lower end RTX 4070 is still a couple hundred dollars more than the starting Intel Arc GPU.

68
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,980
And I can already hear you guys saying, yeah, they're not really comparable.

69
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:11,240
The RTX is still going to be a better gaming card and that kind of stuff.

70
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,960
And I think you're probably right, and it's going to be a little bit probably till they're

71
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,560
totally equivalent in that arena.

72
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,440
But when it comes to just workstation day-to-day desktop use and experience, I bet they are

73
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,520
a little bit more equivalent, and the benchmarks are starting to show that out.

74
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,960
Of course, our buddy Michael Larable over at Ferronix has been watching this story closely.

75
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,720
But I, as a longtime Linux user, I find this really compelling to have another open source

76
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,280
driver stack option for a Linux GPU.

77
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:48,320
This is something we'll keep an eye on and report back any interesting details that develop.

78
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,520
This week, Canonical launched a free tier of their Ubuntu Pro commercial offering.

79
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,960
Ubuntu Pro is a subscription security maintenance and compliance program initially designed

80
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:07,400
for enterprise customers who want long-term stability for their infrastructure and applications.

81
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,440
Ubuntu Pro is somewhat ideal for that use case since the more you pay, seemingly the

82
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,200
less you need to upgrade.

83
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:21,240
Now, however, Canonical decided to expand Ubuntu Pro for personal and small-scale commercial

84
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,320
use with a free tier for up to five machines.

85
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,960
And as Mark Shuttleworth points out, this program doesn't impose the restrictions on

86
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,520
types of users that other enterprise distribution providers do.

87
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,640
All of these programs cover the full distribution for up to 10 years with the option to extend

88
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,800
beyond that for industrial use cases.

89
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,880
And I'm very pleased to say that we are making all of that available free of charge to anybody

90
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,720
with a personal subscription.

91
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,240
It's not a student edition, it's not a developer-only edition, it is full commercial use for you

92
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:29,680
and any business you own on up to five machines.

93
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,080
You guys know me, it was kind of like one of the top reasons.

94
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,880
I first discovered Linode at a Linux fest and I could tell they were one of the few

95
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,000
vendors actually in it because they were geeking out about Linux.

96
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,080
Some of the other vendors were not taking it very seriously and you know, I was just

97
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,640
looking at their calendar, chatting with my buds over at Linode and they've got a lot

98
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,000
coming up in the fall.

99
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,640
They're going to be at a bunch of different events.

100
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,020
I'll put a link in the show notes so that way if you're going to be at one of these,

101
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:00,680
you can say hi, like Hashicomf in Los Angeles coming up right now.

102
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,600
Actually just finished, so scratch that one.

103
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,880
Sastok though, that's coming up, KubeCon, CompTIA, EMA, that's coming up at the end

104
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,080
of the month.

105
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,800
Web Summit next month, IT Nation Connect also coming up.

106
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,560
The Caribbean Developers Conference, how do I get it on that one?

107
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,000
I want to go to the Caribbean, that sounds great.

108
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,560
I mean, they're all over the place, they're always trying to engage and interact with

109
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,560
the community.

110
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,120
That's why they supported our road trip events because they get that Linux, it's made by

111
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,800
the community.

112
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,720
It's worth investing in that layer and then you build out a really great business on top

113
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,720
of that technology platform that the community builds for you.

114
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,440
They've always gotten that concept and so that's why they've invested in these areas

115
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,760
and areas like support and making the UI really work and of course, performance, so fast.

116
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,280
They've got 11 data centers to choose from.

117
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,700
They're adding a dozen, over a dozen next year as well.

118
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:57,480
They are their own ISP on top of all of that and they really have no reason to not work

119
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,240
with any kind of configuration management tool that you want, Chef, Puppet, Ansible,

120
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,660
whatever it is, the Terraforms, yeah, you got that.

121
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,660
They have no reason not to.

122
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,680
They want to be your alternative cloud if that's what you need.

123
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,300
They want to be your primary cloud if that's what you need.

124
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,000
They want to just run whatever simple application you might need.

125
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,040
They try to do all of it and they try to do it better than anybody else and I think they

126
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
nail it.

127
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,400
So that's truly what keeps me as a customer and why I keep building over there.

128
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,880
It's nice to know that support's available if you ever need it.

129
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,060
So if you go get that $100 at linode.com slash LAN, you can really try this stuff.

130
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:36,460
You can see the actual pricing and really get a sense of how it works and I think once

131
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,180
you start to do that, you'll start to see the competitive advantages for yourself.

132
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,720
So go build something, go learn something, go try something while you support the show.

133
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,300
Just go to linode.com slash LAN, get that $100 for the best place on the internet to

134
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,440
run your applications.

135
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,260
I mean the best place to host your services, your applications, and to get a full Linux

136
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:03,720
box, linode.com slash LAN.

137
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,900
And a big thank you to my friends over at Kalyde, Kalyde.com slash LAN.

138
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,040
Kalyde is an endpoint security solution that uses the most powerful untapped resource in

139
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,200
IT, the end users.

140
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,320
When you're trying to achieve security, maybe it's something you've set for yourself as

141
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,320
a goal, maybe it's a third party audit, maybe you have a new boss in town.

142
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,640
There's been so many ways that companies, businesses, organizations, schools, what have

143
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
you have tried this.

144
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,040
I've seen a lot of it over the years.

145
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,720
Conventional wisdom was just to treat every device like it's Fort Knox.

146
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,560
You just go all in on like just this really old school draconian device management, MDMs

147
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,640
that force disruptive agents onto employees' devices, slow down performance, and they often

148
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,040
treat privacy as an afterthought.

149
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,800
That was just an awful way of doing things because it makes a bad experience for the

150
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,240
end user which kind of pits them against IT and does not create the best atmosphere, sort

151
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,560
of makes them enemies.

152
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
And also creates its own security problems.

153
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,760
It often also results in sort of a shadow IT structure just so the employees can quote

154
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,720
do their jobs.

155
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,520
Kalyde does things differently.

156
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:20,960
Instead of forcing changes on users, Kalyde sends them security recommendations via Slack.

157
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Kalyde will automatically notify your team when their devices are insecure and it'll

158
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:29,820
give them step-by-step instructions on how to solve the problem.

159
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,500
And by reaching out to employees just with a friendly Slack DM and educating them about

160
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,900
company policies, Kalyde can help you build a culture for which everyone is contributing

161
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:46,120
to security because, well, everyone understands how and why to do it.

162
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,760
For IT admins, Kalyde provides a single dashboard that lets you monitor the security of your

163
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,760
entire fleet.

164
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,880
It supports Mac, Windows, and of course, Linux desktops.

165
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,760
So you can see at a glance which employees have their disks encrypted, their OS up to

166
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,280
date, and a password manager installed.

167
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,760
Making it easy to prove compliance to your auditors, customers, and leadership.

168
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,240
So that's Kalyde, user-centered cross-platform endpoint security for teams that Slack.

169
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,120
You can meet your compliance goals by putting users first.

170
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,640
Just visit Kalyde.com slash LAN to find out how.

171
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,200
When you go there and you sign up for a free trial, they'll hook you up with a goody bag,

172
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
a real goody bag with a free t-shirt inside.

173
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,720
I do love me a free t-shirt.

174
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,120
That's just for activating a free trial and checking it out.

175
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:39,320
So it's K-O-L-I-D-E dot com slash LAN, Kalyde dot com slash LAN.

176
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,920
We wanted to wrap things up this week with a little heads up.

177
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:51,680
Mulvad VPN has discovered that Android leaks traffic every time the device connects to

178
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,720
a Wi-Fi network.

179
00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:00,280
Imagine if the block connections without VPN or always-on VPN features are enabled.

180
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,880
The data that makes it outside your VPN tunnels includes source IP addresses, DNS lookups,

181
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:10,680
HTTPS traffic, and likely also some NTP traffic.

182
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,960
Yeah, Android does things like check for a captive portal every time you connect to a

183
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,040
new Wi-Fi AP.

184
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,860
It tries to determine if the user needs help to get fully connected.

185
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,620
This is by design, Android was built this way.

186
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,080
It is a choice by Google just to make things easier for users.

187
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,240
But I think anyone really familiar with Network Unity knows this, you're going to inevitably

188
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,360
reveal details about yourself and your machine if you go out and probe the state of the network

189
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,600
and try to find the edge devices.

190
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,920
And to make this worse, I think most developers and users probably had the wrong idea about

191
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:54,120
what block connections without VPN exactly meant here, especially compounded by poor

192
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,800
Android documentation that inaccurately describes the feature.

193
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,080
Yeah, that's where you could almost fry some conspiracy bacon with this story.

194
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:10,100
The wording around the feature in the Android OS sort of implies that everything gets blocked

195
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,480
if a VPN is turned on, it only goes through that tunnel.

196
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,240
And I've experienced this setting by accident when I first installed TailScale.

197
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,560
And I had it set to tunnel everything through VPN, and that's not how TailScale works.

198
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,760
And so nothing worked, at least that I knew of, I didn't realize it was leaking information

199
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,120
at the time.

200
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,380
But then we're like, you could see someone getting conspiratorial here is you go read

201
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,560
the documentation for Android developers.

202
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,640
And they also really make it sound like nothing gets out.

203
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,600
And maybe the people writing the documentation just didn't understand the nuances of what

204
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,120
was happening there.

205
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,160
Maybe it's a right hand not talking to the left hand kind of thing.

206
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,280
I mean, as an example, you can take Graphene OS, there's an option in there where the user

207
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,240
can toggle that check.

208
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,480
If they toggle it, so the check doesn't happen.

209
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,140
The researchers did not observe Graphene OS leaking this information that simple setting

210
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:10,160
that Graphene OS exposes that gives the user control seems to fix this issue.

211
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,080
Mulvad just simply discovered this because they were conducting their own audit of their

212
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,240
own apps, trying to figure out why it seemed like their app was leaking information when

213
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
it was on the network.

214
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,560
And it turned out it wasn't an issue with the Mulvad VPN at all.

215
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,840
It was an issue with Android.

216
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:33,400
Now of course, the core privacy concern here is that that connection check traffic, well,

217
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,880
it can be observed and analyzed both by the party controlling the connectivity check server,

218
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,140
but also anyone else on the network path between.

219
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,360
And even if the content of the message itself doesn't reveal anything more than some Android

220
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:55,160
devices connecting to this network, the metadata, which includes the source IP address, well,

221
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,880
that can be used to derive further information, especially if you combine that with other

222
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,480
data such as Wi-Fi access point locations.

223
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:09,840
Unfortunately, it seems iOS users, well, they're in the same boat, if not a boat that's a little

224
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,640
bit more leaky.

225
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,880
A security researcher back in August found a significant flaw in iOS VPN apps and a second

226
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,720
researcher has now demonstrated another major issue.

227
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,320
Details in the show notes for that one.

228
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:30,240
Yeah, a bit more leaky indeed, some of that second research shows that a lot of Apple's

229
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,000
core apps, they just bypass your VPN if things aren't working right, cause they want to talk

230
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
to the home server.

231
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
They don't care.

232
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,080
So you're leaking even more metadata in those circumstances.

233
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,200
That's definitely worth reading.

234
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,440
You know, the situation here is sort of unfixable by the VPN vendors.

235
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,720
There's nothing Mulvad can do to solve this problem.

236
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,720
It's a limitation of how these OSs are built, at least the stock OSs, which is what most

237
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,320
users are going to use.

238
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,600
Mulvad has submitted their suggestions to revise the documentation around the block

239
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,480
connections feature, just to make it more clear what data is still being sent outside

240
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,880
the VPN at least.

241
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,860
Yeah, they have a pretty nice write up, which we'll have linked in the docs.

242
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:18,600
And in that they end on a pretty simple recommendation, quote, as a closing note, we would like to

243
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:25,880
recommend Google adopt the ability to disable connectivity checks like on Graphene OS into

244
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
stock Android.

245
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,200
Yeah.

246
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:36,360
From their fingers to Google's ears, I guess it just seems like a relatively easy solution.

247
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,960
If they wanted to, they could even just probably get the code from Graphene OS.

248
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,000
And if they wanted to impress us with their development prowess, they could create it

249
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
from scratch.

250
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,760
I'd be happy with either one.

251
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Just add a user controlled option to let us check for captive portals or not.

252
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,800
Just let us have control over that setting.

253
00:18:52,800 --> 00:19:00,920
I have to say, if you have a pixel, Graphene OS has just really exceeded all my expectations.

254
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:06,080
I have kind of ended up using it in a somewhat compromised way because I do have the play

255
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:11,560
API and the play store on there, but Graphene OS allows you to use them in a sandbox way.

256
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,640
It's extremely clever and very effective.

257
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,560
Now the mainstream commercial operating systems, they're always likely to err on the side of

258
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,360
convenience over privacy.

259
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,400
You kind of have to pick one.

260
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,840
And I think if you'd prefer things to bend a bit more towards the privacy side, and you

261
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,240
can get your hands on some pixel hardware, I have to highly recommend giving Graphene

262
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,660
OS a try.

263
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,440
It might just exceed your expectations too.

264
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,800
But if the situation with the commercial OSes ever improves, well, of course we'll let you

265
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
know.

266
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,480
With all of that and everything else happening in the world of Linux and open source, go

267
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,560

268
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,520
And linuxactionnews.com slash contact to let us know your source IP address so we don't

269
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,900
have to rely on the leaks.

270
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,040
If you haven't checked out our PeerTube instance, head over to jupyter.tube.

271

You can see how we make some of our podcasts.

272
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,220
Just not this year's show.

273
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,960
That's top secret.

274
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
Don't worry though.

275
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,480
We'll keep it secret in the back end.

276
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,040
But only until next week when we'll be back with our take on the latest Linux and open

277
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,800
source news.

278
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:42,960
Thanks for joining us and that's all the news for this week.
