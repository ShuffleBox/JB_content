00:00.000 --> 00:08.480
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 150, recorded on March 21st, 2020.

00:08.480 --> 00:09.480
I'm Chris.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.480
And I'm Joe.

00:10.480 --> 00:11.480
Hello, Joe.

00:11.480 --> 00:12.680
Good to be connected with you.

00:12.680 --> 00:16.480
What do you say we start out with the big news from NPM this week?

00:16.480 --> 00:22.720
Yes, NPM has been acquired by GitHub, or is that Microsoft?

00:22.720 --> 00:25.800
I think it's the more palatable way to say Microsoft.

00:25.800 --> 00:32.760
Well, in the press releases from NPM and from GitHub, they did not mention Microsoft once,

00:32.760 --> 00:35.000
which is quite telling.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.520
And it seems that it is going to be under the management of GitHub, obviously with Microsoft

00:39.520 --> 00:42.880
overseeing things and ultimately financing it.

00:42.880 --> 00:47.280
But I think that Microsoft are going to be hands off.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.920
They've been relatively hands off with GitHub, haven't they so far?

00:50.920 --> 00:54.400
Or at least hands on in a way that people like.

00:54.400 --> 00:57.400
And maybe this is ultimately a good thing for NPM.

00:57.400 --> 01:01.040
I think that's the very goodwill they're cashing in on with this announcement.

01:01.040 --> 01:03.520
And I think it's clear it will be managed by GitHub.

01:03.520 --> 01:09.320
NPM makes more sense as a product of GitHub than it does of any other component of Microsoft's

01:09.320 --> 01:10.560
offerings.

01:10.560 --> 01:14.300
It's still probably a pretty big shock, though, to millions of developers who use that public

01:14.300 --> 01:16.120
registry every day.

01:16.120 --> 01:21.480
Now Nat Friedman on the GitHub blog post does say that they will keep the registry free

01:21.480 --> 01:22.480
forever.

01:22.480 --> 01:26.240
They've developed an infrastructure for that, that they will improve the core experience.

01:26.240 --> 01:29.840
And he gives a couple of examples of that, specifically improving on the CLI tools, which

01:29.840 --> 01:31.240
I think is awesome.

01:31.240 --> 01:34.880
And they intend to engage more with the larger JavaScript community.

01:34.880 --> 01:39.200
One thing that stuck out to me in some of the messaging, and it's here in Nat Friedman's

01:39.200 --> 01:45.880
announcement, is this language around improving the security of, quote, the open source software

01:45.880 --> 01:47.840
supply chain.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.440
I think that's an interesting way to look at NPM.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.760
But we have definitely talked about some of the security issues these software registries

01:55.760 --> 01:58.080
have experienced in the past.

01:58.080 --> 02:01.960
And I would credit Microsoft with managing their infrastructure pretty well so far.

02:01.960 --> 02:07.160
Well, that's another reason why this may well be good news for NPM ultimately, is that apart

02:07.160 --> 02:10.280
from the finances, it's the management of this.

02:10.280 --> 02:17.000
It's the fact that we hopefully won't see these security issues, developers just pulling

02:17.000 --> 02:22.160
their project out and messing up all the projects that depend on that.

02:22.160 --> 02:25.160
Hopefully GitHub will be able to manage all that properly.

02:25.160 --> 02:29.600
And so we'll see a kind of more professional NPM as a result of this.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.480
Maybe they'd have to come up with some solutions for basic human nature.

02:33.480 --> 02:37.680
Perhaps monetizations for projects that are struggling could help with that.

02:37.680 --> 02:39.680
I'm skeptical.

02:39.680 --> 02:44.400
Let's put NPM's footprint into context for a moment.

02:44.400 --> 02:52.120
NPM serves over 1.3 million packages to roughly 12 million developers who download these things

02:52.120 --> 02:55.520
75 billion times a month.

02:55.520 --> 03:02.280
And if the trends continue in a few years, those numbers will seem tiny.

03:02.280 --> 03:08.960
If the trajectory continues, I bring all that up to just kind of turn this around and say,

03:08.960 --> 03:14.760
is it maybe not even just important, but is it maybe critical that something like NPM

03:14.760 --> 03:18.840
remains independent in an open source free software ecosystem?

03:18.840 --> 03:24.800
There's obviously, like we just mentioned, benefits to the pockets of Microsoft, especially

03:24.800 --> 03:28.680
under the leadership of Nat Friedman, who seems to be doing a fantastic job.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.740
Obvious benefits, but I just thought, let's play devil's advocate.

03:31.740 --> 03:36.560
This seems like a pretty big, important piece of our open source software ecosystem.

03:36.560 --> 03:41.440
If you'll take a term from their announcement, shouldn't it be independent?

03:41.440 --> 03:45.200
Shouldn't it be something that is not owned by a single commercial entity?

03:45.200 --> 03:50.080
Well, it was owned by a single commercial entity before, NPM Inc.

03:50.080 --> 03:56.720
But they're a small independent company that when you read their side of the announcement,

03:56.720 --> 03:59.840
sounds like things weren't always great, that they've had some struggles and that maybe

03:59.840 --> 04:02.200
this needed to happen for them.

04:02.200 --> 04:09.120
But I guess maybe let's fantasize in a world where a foundation of sorts steps in and it

04:09.120 --> 04:15.600
becomes something that is maybe managed in that sense instead of managed by a holding

04:15.600 --> 04:20.240
company, which then manages another company, which there's a lot of conflicting interests

04:20.240 --> 04:21.240
there.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.640
I do get where you're coming from here.

04:22.640 --> 04:26.200
And maybe the foundation route could have been something they did.

04:26.200 --> 04:30.940
But if you're going to try and compete in the commercial world, then consolidation is

04:30.940 --> 04:32.800
just inevitable, isn't it?

04:32.800 --> 04:38.200
The only way to survive is just by becoming part of a bigger and bigger entity.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.120
And that entity, in this case, is Microsoft.

04:41.120 --> 04:46.060
I think the reality of the market right now, especially here in the States, but really

04:46.060 --> 04:53.000
around the world, is there are four significant, five-ish significant tech companies.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.320
And if you want to get to millions and billions, you got to go through their gates.

04:58.320 --> 05:01.680
And that, in a way, gets products into the hands of users that never would have had access

05:01.680 --> 05:03.040
to that technology.

05:03.040 --> 05:06.640
But it also limits the way it gate keeps, essentially, the way you can get to market.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.200
But aside from that, I think the reality of the numbers here suggests that you would need

05:10.200 --> 05:15.000
infrastructure experts running NPM within a year or two.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.900
Not that they're not already, clearly.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.880
But you need somebody who can really operate at scale.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.100
And that's one of the big tech companies.

05:23.100 --> 05:27.320
And Microsoft is clearly one of the ideal candidates if you're going to pick from the

05:27.320 --> 05:28.320
top five.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.000
I'm very glad this wasn't Facebook.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.600
I'm pretty glad this wasn't Google or Apple, too.

05:32.600 --> 05:36.640
And it's yet more evidence of Microsoft's shift towards open source.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.640
Right.

05:37.640 --> 05:41.280
And this fits in line with what we've kind of been saying recently with WSL, the new

05:41.280 --> 05:44.840
terminal and GitHub's acquisition in general.

05:44.840 --> 05:49.080
It seems Microsoft has realized during a gold rush, the way you're going to make money at

05:49.080 --> 05:54.200
this point is by selling the axes and the pixes and the shovels and whatever, the tools,

05:54.200 --> 05:55.200
to the gold miners.

05:55.200 --> 05:59.320
And in this analogy, open source development is the gold mine.

05:59.320 --> 06:00.320
Yeah.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.600
And all that shiny new open source code is the gold.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.600
Exactly.

06:03.600 --> 06:08.040
And Microsoft's more than happy to help you get that gold because their tools and services,

06:08.040 --> 06:12.280
a lot of them have a monthly price attached to them.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.000
And now NPM is another set of those tools.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.040
But more importantly, I think it will signal to the market that this is a safe bet.

06:20.040 --> 06:23.600
It's in the hands of GitHub now and Microsoft.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.800
You can depend on this.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.480
Some in our community will have the exact opposite reaction.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.200
To them, it's now going to be something that's suspicious.

06:31.200 --> 06:36.800
It's something that probably needs a free replacement, something alternative to.

06:36.800 --> 06:42.360
But to a larger segment of the market, and especially to the business types, this will

06:42.360 --> 06:45.200
be a signal of stability and safety for NPM.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.200
Yeah.

06:46.200 --> 06:50.200
And exactly where that split is and how many people are on each side of it, we'll be telling.

06:50.200 --> 06:54.000
I suspect there'll be far more people on the business side of things.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.720
I'd like to know how much they paid.

06:55.720 --> 06:59.200
NPM and GitHub are not sharing that detail right now.

06:59.200 --> 07:06.760
I'm curious, how much does a world famous software repository go for?

07:06.760 --> 07:07.760
How much is this all worth?

07:07.760 --> 07:11.480
I'd really like to know, but nays the word on that one so far.

07:11.480 --> 07:14.100
Well, it wasn't the only GitHub news this week.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.540
The iOS and Android apps are now out of beta.

07:17.540 --> 07:19.680
Had the NPM acquisition not happened.

07:19.680 --> 07:25.520
This may have been a bigger story because neither one of these apps for Android or iOS

07:25.520 --> 07:26.920
are open source.

07:26.920 --> 07:31.420
And interestingly, GitHub wrote the apps separately for each platform.

07:31.420 --> 07:35.480
They used Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android.

07:35.480 --> 07:36.480
I find that interesting.

07:36.480 --> 07:41.240
They went for a native look for each one of them with a couple of shared components and

07:41.240 --> 07:42.520
toolbar stuff in there.

07:42.520 --> 07:46.040
And it has some essential basic functionality that you would come to expect.

07:46.040 --> 07:47.040
It doesn't have everything.

07:47.040 --> 07:50.280
That's one of the main complaints on Twitter right now is people grousing about what it

07:50.280 --> 07:51.400
doesn't do.

07:51.400 --> 07:54.440
But it lets you organize tasks very simply in a mobile UI.

07:54.440 --> 07:58.120
It gives you the ability to respond to feedback and issues.

07:58.120 --> 08:01.880
And obviously the big feature allows you to review and merge pull requests.

08:01.880 --> 08:05.080
Yeah, you're right that there's been some negative feedback about the stuff that it

08:05.080 --> 08:06.080
can't do.

08:06.080 --> 08:09.680
But I've also seen some very positive feedback about stuff that it can do.

08:09.680 --> 08:13.000
I've seen some devs tweeting about how they can get some of these tasks done while they're

08:13.000 --> 08:15.040
waiting in line for groceries or whatever.

08:15.040 --> 08:18.360
So I think mixed reaction is the fairest way to describe it.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.360
Yeah.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.040
And the thing to remember is these apps aren't done.

08:21.040 --> 08:27.220
In fact, I believe it was implied by Ryan Nystrom that the apps may go open source.

08:27.220 --> 08:31.360
He was asked and he said, well, they're not open source now, but maybe in the future.

08:31.360 --> 08:35.640
And you could see possibly as they add new features and whatnot that perhaps one day

08:35.640 --> 08:40.160
they'll also have a big announcement, GitHub's mobile apps are now open source.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.160
One can dream, Joe.

08:41.160 --> 08:42.160
Yeah, we can.

08:42.160 --> 08:45.680
It's funny that he tweeted, it's not right now regarding the code being open source.

08:45.680 --> 08:48.600
And that was from Twitter for iPhone.

08:48.600 --> 08:53.120
Hey, that Twitter app launches real fast on iOS, Joe.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.560
So I hear.

08:54.560 --> 09:00.440
Well, something that has taken a while to launch is Linux Mint Debian Edition 4, Debian,

09:00.440 --> 09:01.760
which has been released this week.

09:01.760 --> 09:08.160
Yeah, I think it's been a few years, but it's here, LMDE 4, Debian Edition.

09:08.160 --> 09:15.000
And this is their hedge on Ubuntu going away one day, keeping the project sustainable with

09:15.000 --> 09:16.760
a different base.

09:16.760 --> 09:23.840
But over the years, it's kind of turned into a semi unofficial slash official way to have

09:23.840 --> 09:26.660
a slow release rolling Mint desktop.

09:26.660 --> 09:28.480
But it has seen a bit of neglect over the years.

09:28.480 --> 09:33.920
They'll kind of release it and then certain packages get updated and it gets a bit kind

09:33.920 --> 09:38.700
of left behind while they concentrate on the main Linux Mint Edition.

09:38.700 --> 09:43.960
So I'm really hoping that with LMDE 4, they can give it a bit more time and resources

09:43.960 --> 09:48.960
now because I installed this yesterday and I was actually really impressed by it.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.580
Recent versions of Cinnamon are pretty good.

09:50.580 --> 09:54.520
And that's the primary experience you get with Linux Mint Debian Edition.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.440
I like it.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.400
For me, it's not quite the right fit.

09:58.400 --> 10:05.880
So it's based on Debian 10 Buster and it has kernel 4.19, which feels like it's from a

10:05.880 --> 10:08.320
hundred years ago at this point.

10:08.320 --> 10:13.960
So there's things I like about it in that the concept of a semi rolling release, because

10:13.960 --> 10:19.400
sometimes upgrades are challenging with Mint, that's based on Debian, which is a great foundation

10:19.400 --> 10:25.980
with Cinnamon, which is turning into a top grade desktop environment that needs upgrades

10:25.980 --> 10:27.480
every three to four years.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.680
That kind of sounds almost like your perfect kind of thing.

10:29.680 --> 10:33.200
It seems like it's right in your alley, but for me, it's just a little too old.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.200
Well, yeah.

10:34.200 --> 10:38.720
And also the fact that Cinnamon is very Windows-like, I can see why you don't like it because you

10:38.720 --> 10:44.400
don't really like Windows, but I think as a UI, that's perfectly fine.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.860
So I like it.

10:45.860 --> 10:50.440
It's been ages since I've tried out Cinnamon or Mint of any description, but I think I

10:50.440 --> 10:52.400
should maybe give it a bit more attention.

10:52.400 --> 10:56.000
I think if I was going to switch to Mint, I'd probably want to go with the main edition

10:56.000 --> 11:02.160
because if I were betting on the odds in Vegas, I would bet that between Ubuntu, Linux Mint

11:02.160 --> 11:07.280
proper and Debian and Linux Mint Debian edition, if any one of those distros was ever going

11:07.280 --> 11:11.360
to go away, first I would bet on Linux Mint Debian edition going away.

11:11.360 --> 11:16.520
Then before I ever bet on Ubuntu going away, I'd bet on Debian going away because the project

11:16.520 --> 11:18.200
is cratering right now anyways.

11:18.200 --> 11:22.700
People are living in a fantasy land if they think Debian is in a sustainable point right

11:22.700 --> 11:23.700
now.

11:23.700 --> 11:27.440
I haven't been listening to enough of these shows, but this project is on the verge of

11:27.440 --> 11:28.440
cratering.

11:28.440 --> 11:32.480
And there may be a future where Ubuntu has to pull this up by its bootstraps and just

11:32.480 --> 11:36.280
have their own repository that they build off and we have Ubuntu proper.

11:36.280 --> 11:41.560
I would bet on that way more than I'd bet on this escape hatch ever needing to be pulled

11:41.560 --> 11:42.980
for the Mint project.

11:42.980 --> 11:47.060
And so I just look at this from a practical standpoint and go, I don't know if I see another

11:47.060 --> 11:48.500
five years in this.

11:48.500 --> 11:53.040
You might be right, but it never hurts to hedge your bets to some extent.

11:53.040 --> 11:57.920
I suppose it depends how much in terms of resources and time is going into this.

11:57.920 --> 12:02.440
If it's just a kind of side project for them, then why not keep it on the back burner?

12:02.440 --> 12:03.440
That's what I think.

12:03.440 --> 12:07.040
And that's why when we talk about their cadence and some of the packages being out of date,

12:07.040 --> 12:12.840
I think that makes sense when you consider this is it's a plan B and I think it gets

12:12.840 --> 12:14.720
the right amount of appropriate resources.

12:14.720 --> 12:23.240
I'm reminded of the old tales that Apple used to keep x86 max in the bowels of Apple when

12:23.240 --> 12:25.360
they were on power PC just in case.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.320
And then one day, guess what?

12:27.320 --> 12:30.840
That became the predominant platform and the reason they were able to make that transition

12:30.840 --> 12:36.520
successfully was because they had kept x86 builds and x86 machines around essentially

12:36.520 --> 12:43.960
as hackintoshes and that gave them the runway to actually make it successful.

12:43.960 --> 12:48.620
And that's kind of the same exact theory that's being applied here for Linux Mint.

12:48.620 --> 12:50.160
So I like it.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.600
The idea, I mean, I get why they're doing it.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.760
It even seems sort of practical.

12:54.760 --> 13:00.060
I just would maybe dial down the rhetoric a little bit in the announcement paragraph

13:00.060 --> 13:01.060
for this release.

13:01.060 --> 13:06.520
Second sentence, quote, its goal is to ensure Linux Mint would be able to continue to deliver

13:06.520 --> 13:13.360
the same user experiences and how much work would be involved if Ubuntu were ever to disappear.

13:13.360 --> 13:17.200
And then it's actually restated a little bit later, too, in here.

13:17.200 --> 13:23.660
That just seems almost a little disrespectful if you consider that Linux Mint was made possible

13:23.660 --> 13:28.520
because it's able to piggyback on all of the work that goes into an LTS.

13:28.520 --> 13:33.400
It's sort of been the mother's milk for this distribution that now pays a good amount of

13:33.400 --> 13:35.040
money every single month.

13:35.040 --> 13:39.680
It seems like you'd have some sort of reverence and respect for your parent distribution,

13:39.680 --> 13:44.540
especially by my estimation, when it has a better shot than Debian at this point of surviving.

13:44.540 --> 13:46.320
And yes, I understand Ubuntu is based on Debian.

13:46.320 --> 13:48.840
Well, that leads us into the next story then, doesn't it?

13:48.840 --> 13:52.000
And that is the Debian Project Leader Elections 2020.

13:52.000 --> 13:56.460
And there are three candidates with quite different manifestos.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.680
I think there's one candidate.

13:57.680 --> 14:03.560
And that's why I am maybe hitting this as hard as I am in this episode, because I look

14:03.560 --> 14:09.840
at these candidates in front of us, and I nearly panic for the future of my beloved

14:09.840 --> 14:15.100
Debian distribution, a distribution that has been around for as long as I have been in

14:15.100 --> 14:18.220
Linux and was key in me getting started.

14:18.220 --> 14:21.160
It's a distribution that I have a deep respect for.

14:21.160 --> 14:25.600
And the three candidates that are applying, well, at least two of the three are not ideal.

14:25.600 --> 14:27.480
This project is in bad shape.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.960
People are in denial about the state of this project.

14:29.960 --> 14:33.220
And I don't really see anyone fully addressing any of it.

14:33.220 --> 14:38.120
I don't think any of them fully solve the problems the project is facing right now.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.120
Do you feel that way?

14:39.120 --> 14:42.960
Yeah, I think that whoever wins, you're going to have problems.

14:42.960 --> 14:49.400
You've got Jonathan Carter, whose platform is continue to do what Debian does well, among

14:49.400 --> 14:53.180
some other things as well, but he concentrates on technical excellence and promoting free

14:53.180 --> 14:58.260
software and things like that, basically more of the same.

14:58.260 --> 15:02.580
And he kind of does address some of the other issues that are there, but he's very much

15:02.580 --> 15:05.060
the continuity candidate.

15:05.060 --> 15:11.580
Then you've got Sruti Chandran, whose platform is very much about diversity.

15:11.580 --> 15:18.520
It's not quite a single issue, but it's very much concentrating on the diversity angle

15:18.520 --> 15:21.040
and increasing diversity within Debian.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.620
And she doesn't have as much experience as the other candidates.

15:23.620 --> 15:28.300
And we know that diversity is a very divisive issue.

15:28.300 --> 15:33.320
And then you've got Brian Gupta, who says, I'm running for DPL with a singular goal,

15:33.320 --> 15:38.960
the creation of Debian US and EU foundations, I largely view my candidacy as a referendum

15:38.960 --> 15:41.060
on this goal and its details.

15:41.060 --> 15:43.960
So he's very much a single issue candidate.

15:43.960 --> 15:48.720
And he describes in his platform about how he's going to achieve that.

15:48.720 --> 15:54.360
And it's basically adding a lot of bureaucracy, which he sees is required for the project

15:54.360 --> 15:55.760
to continue.

15:55.760 --> 16:01.140
So you've got three very different approaches here, which are all kind of divisive in their

16:01.140 --> 16:02.140
own way.

16:02.140 --> 16:06.620
So it seems that no matter who wins, it's not going to solve any problems.

16:06.620 --> 16:10.900
And we kind of talked about this a couple of episodes ago, that it needs someone to

16:10.900 --> 16:16.340
come in and really take charge of this situation and bring everyone together, but maybe that's

16:16.340 --> 16:17.340
just impossible.

16:17.340 --> 16:20.740
Soterios Johnson Clearly, Carter and Gupta have the most experience

16:20.740 --> 16:21.740
with Debian.

16:21.740 --> 16:25.580
Gupta has been a Debian member for about seven years.

16:25.580 --> 16:33.320
Carter has been in the development field for a long time, but also been in Debian the project

16:33.320 --> 16:35.520
itself for quite a while.

16:35.520 --> 16:41.920
And then Chandran is new, she's been a developer since May of 2019 and a maintainer of a package

16:41.920 --> 16:44.080
on Debian since 2016.

16:44.080 --> 16:51.720
My concern is all of these candidates, while good candidates for those singular issues,

16:51.720 --> 16:55.660
are not addressing the spectrum of problems that's going to cause this distribution to

16:55.660 --> 16:57.460
implode upon itself.

16:57.460 --> 17:01.980
Debian is a platform, it's more than just a couple of packages, it's more than one architecture.

17:01.980 --> 17:02.980
Debian itself is a platform.

17:02.980 --> 17:09.100
It's an entire operating system that uses the Linux kernel, really, and the GPL land.

17:09.100 --> 17:12.500
I don't feel like any of them are looking at it from that perspective.

17:12.500 --> 17:17.080
And additionally, the only one that seems to actually have the experience and a somewhat

17:17.080 --> 17:18.980
decent platform seems to be Carter.

17:18.980 --> 17:23.140
So there only really seems to be one candidate here who has the goal for technical excellence

17:23.140 --> 17:29.040
and making the community easier and more straightforward to contribute and participate in, and remove

17:29.040 --> 17:33.780
bottlenecks for new contributors, and work on attending to some of the basic housekeeping

17:33.780 --> 17:36.480
items of the Debian project that have been neglected.

17:36.480 --> 17:39.600
Carter is the only one that's addressing all of those, and I don't normally hit this so

17:39.600 --> 17:40.600
hard.

17:40.600 --> 17:44.380
In fact, we've covered Debian elections twice now on this show before, and I've never hit

17:44.380 --> 17:45.700
it this hard before.

17:45.700 --> 17:48.460
But I cannot stress this fact enough.

17:48.460 --> 17:51.460
If you are not paying attention to what's happening to the Debian project, you need

17:51.460 --> 17:53.820
to wake up and pay attention to what's happening.

17:53.820 --> 17:54.820
And this matters.

17:54.820 --> 17:59.140
This election for the Debian project, it matters more than any of these we've ever covered

17:59.140 --> 18:03.340
before in the 13 years that I've been on air covering Debian news.

18:03.340 --> 18:07.940
Well, I wouldn't go that far as to say that the project's doomed or anything, but I think

18:07.940 --> 18:13.460
it is in serious trouble, and whoever wins this does need to bring it together.

18:13.460 --> 18:16.460
I think reading through the platforms, you're probably right.

18:16.460 --> 18:21.180
I would probably vote for Jonathan Carter, but I do worry that he's going to kind of

18:21.180 --> 18:26.940
leave behind the people who want to see more diversity and stuff.

18:26.940 --> 18:31.860
And this system D situation that's been bubbling again, there's not really any mention of that

18:31.860 --> 18:37.300
in any of these platforms here, so that's going to have to be dealt with.

18:37.300 --> 18:42.620
It does seem like they're going to be testing times ahead, and I just don't have huge confidence

18:42.620 --> 18:46.820
reading through these three that any of them are going to be able to manage it.

18:46.820 --> 18:51.500
I foresee them not doing more than one term, put it that way.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.300
This definitely comes from a place of passion for me.

18:53.300 --> 18:57.180
I am oddly enough extremely passionate about the Debian project.

18:57.180 --> 19:04.420
I think it's just an essential, essential part of the free software ecosystem.

19:04.420 --> 19:10.460
And I think to play nice, everyone has sort of glossed over how bad this has gotten.

19:10.460 --> 19:14.980
And to your earlier point, one of the reasons why I think they are quite doomed is it's

19:14.980 --> 19:15.980
too late.

19:15.980 --> 19:19.820
The conversations are too far along to just shut individuals out.

19:19.820 --> 19:23.900
These people need and deserve representation because they are now officially parts of the

19:23.900 --> 19:26.780
project, and their viewpoints have to be heard.

19:26.780 --> 19:31.860
And if they're ignored, it's just going to irritate the problem that much worse, and

19:31.860 --> 19:34.500
it's going to slow things down that much more.

19:34.500 --> 19:38.780
I think we've probably hit this maybe even harder than we need to, but I think what I

19:38.780 --> 19:42.940
am worried is, is that I'm going to spend the next two years on the air, or longer,

19:42.940 --> 19:46.780
I don't know how long, documenting the collapse of this distribution.

19:46.780 --> 19:51.540
And that, it literally chokes me up and makes me sick to my stomach to think about that.

19:51.540 --> 19:52.860
I don't think it's going to collapse.

19:52.860 --> 19:57.340
I think that it's going to change, and that change may well be for the worse, but I don't

19:57.340 --> 20:00.820
think it's just going to go away after 20-odd years of being around.

20:00.820 --> 20:02.140
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

20:02.140 --> 20:07.140
After all, I think I have family members who still watch VHS.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.460
I think my mom's still got some somewhere.

20:09.460 --> 20:14.860
Well, from the free software end of Linux to completely the other end, this week we

20:14.860 --> 20:17.780
saw the announcement of the Works with Chromebook stickers.

20:17.780 --> 20:21.260
Well, it is Gen 2 after all, Joe, just not as we know it.

20:21.260 --> 20:23.180
Not as we know it.

20:23.180 --> 20:27.820
These are, much like other manufacturers that have Works with, it's a similar idea where

20:27.820 --> 20:32.780
Google will actually test the accessories to ensure they comply with Chromebooks, and

20:32.780 --> 20:34.320
then they put a badge on there.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.180
And then you know that it's good to go with a Chromebook.

20:37.180 --> 20:42.060
I do like this from the standpoint of Chromebooks are great for family members that don't need

20:42.060 --> 20:46.820
a Windows or a Mac machine for their computer uses, and Chromebooks kind of work well for

20:46.820 --> 20:47.820
that.

20:47.820 --> 20:51.300
And now you can just point them at a category of chargers and keyboards and other accessories

20:51.300 --> 20:56.460
like cables and adapters that are all tested by Google to work with the Chromebook.

20:56.460 --> 20:58.260
It's kind of a nice idea.

20:58.260 --> 21:02.400
Yeah, and my first thought was if it's going to work with a Chromebook, it's going to work

21:02.400 --> 21:04.860
with basically any Linux distro.

21:04.860 --> 21:07.500
That's what I was just going to say, and there's some nice stuff on here.

21:07.500 --> 21:12.220
You know, Logitech has some devices like webcams and headsets that are supposedly going to be

21:12.220 --> 21:16.600
certified to work with Chromebooks, which really means, and that's why I made the Gen 2 joke,

21:16.600 --> 21:19.820
they're working with the Linux kernel because that's where these drivers are implemented.

21:19.820 --> 21:24.380
Yeah, so this is ultimately something we've talked about for a long time, which is having

21:24.380 --> 21:28.140
a Works with Linux sticker, which is effectively what we're talking about here.

21:28.140 --> 21:32.700
It might be through the back door and, you know, there might be some proprietary stuff

21:32.700 --> 21:38.540
on top of Linux that Google is controlling and capturing all your data, but ultimately

21:38.540 --> 21:44.300
you will be able to walk into a bricks and mortar shop, look around at the accessories

21:44.300 --> 21:46.580
and know what is going to actually work with Linux.

21:46.580 --> 21:51.180
I mean, these days, most of it is just going to work anyway, but this way you'll actually

21:51.180 --> 21:52.180
know.

21:52.180 --> 21:53.180
Yep.

21:53.180 --> 21:55.700
You can pay a little extra for the USB-C charger right next to the same exact thing that doesn't

21:55.700 --> 21:56.700
have the sticker.

21:56.700 --> 21:58.260
That'll be great.

21:58.260 --> 21:59.260
Oh, what's this?

21:59.260 --> 22:02.500
Oh, I see a sticker on their website for Works with Fuchsia.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.900
No, I'm kidding.

22:04.900 --> 22:05.900
That'll be in the future.

22:05.900 --> 22:06.900
One day.

22:06.900 --> 22:11.940
One of the things that family members have often needed is the ability to print and scan,

22:11.940 --> 22:16.500
and that's where it gets a little weird with Chromebooks, but it appears Chrome OS will

22:16.500 --> 22:22.380
soon get a print management app that just simply allows Chrome OS users to view and

22:22.380 --> 22:25.660
manage native local print jobs.

22:25.660 --> 22:31.340
And because why not, Google seems like they're also slamming in a scanner UI into the print

22:31.340 --> 22:37.100
manager app so you can also interact and scan with a connected scanner.

22:37.100 --> 22:42.580
Honestly, that's like the number one missing feature for family members that have Chromebooks.

22:42.580 --> 22:48.960
So I would not be surprised if they are just slowly incorporating different user feedbacks

22:48.960 --> 22:54.220
from schools and general user communities and just checking these features off in Chrome

22:54.220 --> 22:55.220
OS over time.

22:55.220 --> 22:59.380
Yeah, and eventually it's just going to become yet another full blown Linux distro.

22:59.380 --> 23:02.940
It started out as just a browser and look how far they've come.

23:02.940 --> 23:08.700
Yeah, it truly is a full blown desktop operating system now with window management, Linux apps,

23:08.700 --> 23:10.600
a printer and scanner UI.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.740
The only thing it's missing is a way for me to set up my modem.

23:13.740 --> 23:17.900
Yeah, and I don't know how they're going to solve the problem of not being able to connect

23:17.900 --> 23:21.260
to your printer because I don't think I've ever seen a Chromebook with a serial port

23:21.260 --> 23:22.260
on it.

23:22.260 --> 23:23.260
Oh, boy.

23:23.260 --> 23:24.260
There you go.

23:24.260 --> 23:25.260
There's no serial port.

23:25.260 --> 23:26.260
No, it's fine.

23:26.260 --> 23:28.460
I have an adapter so I can use my parallel port.

23:28.460 --> 23:29.460
Right.

23:29.460 --> 23:35.940
But in slightly more serious news, Chrome and Chrome OS updates are going to be paused

23:35.940 --> 23:38.420
because of this virus situation.

23:38.420 --> 23:41.900
They are going to continue to offer security updates.

23:41.900 --> 23:46.420
That's kind of what they're concentrating on, which I think is quite a sensible approach

23:46.420 --> 23:48.220
in these testing times.

23:48.220 --> 23:53.060
So you're telling me that somehow the coronavirus is delaying Chrome OS releases?

23:53.060 --> 23:57.660
I find this to be a fascinating limitation in the Google infrastructure.

23:57.660 --> 24:01.180
I wonder if it's one that's a technical limitation.

24:01.180 --> 24:04.120
Is it a security limitation?

24:04.120 --> 24:09.620
What is it that prevents them from issuing Chrome OS updates when staff are not physically

24:09.620 --> 24:10.620
in the office?

24:10.620 --> 24:16.060
Well, I am assuming here, based on no evidence, that they are just planning here.

24:16.060 --> 24:21.460
This is contingency planning because people might be taking time off and people might

24:21.460 --> 24:23.460
be getting sick or whatever.

24:23.460 --> 24:27.180
It just seems like if they put this out there now and just say, look, there's not going

24:27.180 --> 24:32.340
to be any Chrome OS updates or any major updates to the Chrome browser, but we will prioritize

24:32.340 --> 24:36.540
security updates, it means even if they end up with a skeleton staff, they'll still be

24:36.540 --> 24:37.540
able to do that.

24:37.540 --> 24:39.420
So I think it's quite a sensible approach, really.

24:39.420 --> 24:40.660
I see what you're saying.

24:40.660 --> 24:44.620
So it's not so much that they can't mission impossible into a central chamber that has

24:44.620 --> 24:49.220
a button that has to be pressed with a retina ID authorization.

24:49.220 --> 24:54.660
It's more like our staff are just dispersed, we're kind of unproductive, so we'll just

24:54.660 --> 24:56.180
focus on security for now.

24:56.180 --> 24:57.180
Yeah, I think so.

24:57.180 --> 24:58.180
All right.

24:58.180 --> 25:01.000
I like the mission impossible visual, but I think you're right.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.060
In the meantime, I'm looking at installing Papel, Joe.

25:04.060 --> 25:05.060
Papel.

25:05.060 --> 25:06.060
I'm done with Cups.

25:06.060 --> 25:11.340
Yeah, this seems to be what Michael Sweet has been working on since he left Apple where

25:11.340 --> 25:13.100
he was working on Cups.

25:13.100 --> 25:19.780
He was doing that weird label printer thing, but it seems that as part of that, that was

25:19.780 --> 25:26.340
called Lprint, this P-A-P-P-L, Papel project, has come and it's an alternative to Cups.

25:26.340 --> 25:28.820
A Cups alternative.

25:28.820 --> 25:32.660
I didn't even know we needed it, but now I'm uninstalling it immediately and putting Papel

25:32.660 --> 25:36.180
on there because it supports all the major imaging formats, it supports printers that

25:36.180 --> 25:42.820
are connected via USB or like jet direct network connections and app sockets, and it's licensed

25:42.820 --> 25:45.780
under the Apache 2.0 license.

25:45.780 --> 25:47.980
It'll incorporate the label printer stuff.

25:47.980 --> 25:54.540
It also leans heavily on the IPP everywhere standard, which is the internet print protocol

25:54.540 --> 25:56.180
and which is part of Cups as well.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.260
It seems like it'll be a nice modern version of Cups.

25:58.260 --> 26:02.420
I don't know why we need it, but I'm actually, I kind of joke about the whole story because

26:02.420 --> 26:05.740
it seems like printing and modems are such a solved problem right now.

26:05.740 --> 26:10.180
However, I'm kind of curious to see where this goes and it's one of the things that

26:10.180 --> 26:16.260
I love about Linux and free software is that sometimes to our detriment, nothing is done

26:16.260 --> 26:17.260
necessarily.

26:17.260 --> 26:21.220
Like how much innovation do you think has gone into the Windows Print Spooler in the

26:21.220 --> 26:23.220
last five years?

26:23.220 --> 26:25.460
Yeah, probably not much.

26:25.460 --> 26:30.940
There's really very little incentive for a commercial company like Microsoft to throw

26:30.940 --> 26:34.900
30, 40 developers, which would cost them tons of money because these are well-paid people

26:34.900 --> 26:39.620
on a very expensive part of the United States to update the Print Spooler, like it's just

26:39.620 --> 26:40.620
not a priority.

26:40.620 --> 26:44.220
It doesn't sell more licenses.

26:44.220 --> 26:45.220
It's silly.

26:45.220 --> 26:50.680
But in the free software land, Michael Sweet had an itch to scratch and here we are looking

26:50.680 --> 26:54.260
at modernizing a component that many of us assumed was done.

26:54.260 --> 26:57.660
And the great thing is, once again, you don't have to choose to use it either.

26:57.660 --> 26:58.660
Yeah, strange.

26:58.660 --> 27:01.500
There's competition in the space where I thought there never would be any.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.060
So that's probably good.

27:03.060 --> 27:06.900
Well spin down your Bitcoin mining, Joe, and focus your GPU on fighting COVID-19.

27:06.900 --> 27:12.780
Yeah, the Folding at Home project has seen a huge resurgence in the last couple of weeks.

27:12.780 --> 27:18.780
And now you can use those unused GPU and CPU cycles to contribute to potentially fighting

27:18.780 --> 27:19.780
this thing.

27:19.780 --> 27:27.300
CoreWeave, which is one of the largest Ethereum miners, has made a decision to redirect 0.2%,

27:27.300 --> 27:34.180
which actually represents 6,000 GPUs towards Folding at Home to help fight COVID, which

27:34.180 --> 27:39.260
is a neat way for a company like this to kind of not only get some good PR, but generally

27:39.260 --> 27:42.780
contribute some very powerful resources to solving a problem.

27:42.780 --> 27:47.380
Yeah, and Intel and Nvidia are encouraging people to do this as well.

27:47.380 --> 27:51.900
There's been a massive jump of like, I think it was 30,000 people were doing it before.

27:51.900 --> 27:55.920
Now there's an extra 400,000 and counting.

27:55.920 --> 27:59.740
And another related story, just a quick follow up from last week, we talked about Firefox

27:59.740 --> 28:05.700
74 having been released, and they had disabled TLS 1.0 and 1.1.

28:05.700 --> 28:09.820
And we were kind of joking about how surely there's no websites out there that are still

28:09.820 --> 28:10.820
using it.

28:10.820 --> 28:14.700
Well, it turns out there are some government sites still using the old standards.

28:14.700 --> 28:22.260
So Firefox has temporarily re-enabled TLS 1.0 and 1.1, so people can actually still

28:22.260 --> 28:23.260
access those sites.

28:23.260 --> 28:26.600
You know, we should have a rule on the show when we're trying to figure out who could

28:26.600 --> 28:29.700
possibly be using ancient technology.

28:29.700 --> 28:33.060
We should just assume it's some government in somewhere in the world.

28:33.060 --> 28:34.060
Somewhere.

28:34.060 --> 28:35.060
Yeah.

28:35.060 --> 28:36.060
Yeah.

28:36.060 --> 28:38.260
That's so not surprising when we think about it.

28:38.260 --> 28:41.300
So good on Mozilla, I suppose, to revert that change.

28:41.300 --> 28:47.300
So that way, nobody has an issue during a global pandemic getting access to information.

28:47.300 --> 28:53.180
One other item that slipped in here that they're kind of pitching as a privacy improvement.

28:53.180 --> 28:59.100
I think it's actually kind of a bug fix for WebRTC in general, but you be the judge.

28:59.100 --> 29:04.400
We're now providing better privacy for web voice and video calls when you're using WebRTC.

29:04.400 --> 29:08.840
So depending on your WebRTC session scenario, you could be actually leaking your public

29:08.840 --> 29:09.840
IP address.

29:09.840 --> 29:12.500
It's one of the kind of downsides to using WebRTC.

29:12.500 --> 29:17.600
However, now Firefox has added support for MD&S ICE, which cloaks your computer's IP

29:17.600 --> 29:22.780
with a random ID in some of those WebRTC scenarios, improving your privacy.

29:22.780 --> 29:27.100
I think you could probably argue that maybe it should have been designed this way from

29:27.100 --> 29:32.540
the very beginning, or you could argue it's an implementation detail and so it's a feature.

29:32.540 --> 29:34.620
Well, either way, it's good news.

29:34.620 --> 29:38.540
And while the world's dealing with all of this, it's business as usual for us.

29:38.540 --> 29:43.140
So go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get future episodes.

29:43.140 --> 29:47.660

29:47.660 --> 29:51.740
And if you'd like my analysis on the world events going on right now, check out Unfilter.

29:51.740 --> 29:52.740
unfilter.show.

29:52.740 --> 29:54.080
It's back, baby.

29:54.080 --> 29:58.500
And just to say Foss Talk Live 2020, which I've mentioned on the show before, that has

29:58.500 --> 29:59.500
now been canceled.

29:59.500 --> 30:02.740
I won't be doing that for pretty obvious reasons.

30:02.740 --> 30:05.300
You can read more about that at fostalk.com.

30:05.300 --> 30:06.300
Maybe in 2021, eh?

30:06.300 --> 30:09.660
Well, in the meantime, we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest

30:09.660 --> 30:11.580
Linux and open source news.
