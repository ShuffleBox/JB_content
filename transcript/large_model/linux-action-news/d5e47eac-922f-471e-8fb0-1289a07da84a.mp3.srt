00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,080
Episode 212, recorded on October 25th, 2021.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,080
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,080
And I'm Wes.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,080
Hello, Wes!

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,680
Just back from an event, and I am in a very rainy, noisy Pacific Northwest, but we're

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,680
going to do the news.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,760
And we're going to start with performance.

9
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:28,400
Just one week ago, LinuxBlock subsystem maintainer Yens Akspo was hitting some new performance

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,740
heights.

11
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:36,360
After optimizing the kernel, he achieved around 8.9 million IOPS per core.

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,360
He and others began to speculate at that point that they might just be hitting the limits

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,520
of the hardware.

14
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,480
It's too much performance, man.

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,160
IOPS, or the input output operations per second, it's like a raw performance measurement that

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,800
you can use to characterize the performance of a drive.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,480
It doesn't directly translate to real world actual performance, but it does give you an

18
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,840
indicator of potential performance.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,840
So measuring the IOPS is part of the overall story about how something is performing, including

20
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,320
the code paths to get you to that device.

21
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,360
And it's one of those tests that Yens can run as he's optimizing the kernel NVMe's

22
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,500
IOU ring code or the memory management code, which he also needed to optimize.

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,120
He makes a tweak, and then he runs a test.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:24,220
And after a whole bunch of tweaking, he managed to smash out 10 million IOPS.

25
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,800
That is just a remarkable performance milestone.

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:33,680
I mean, of course, the system is no slouch, as you might expect, an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,680
with dual Intel P5800X Gen 2 Optane SSDs.

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,520
Right, super nice.

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,760
And he's not going through the file system and lots of other caveats here, but this is

30
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,000
an insane mark to hit.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,920
I mean, there was actual debate if it could even be achieved, and now he's done it.

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,360
But also, I'm a really big fan of these edge case optimization quests that lead to other

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,000
areas that get improved.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And we all benefit.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,040
Yeah, I think this is a big one for really anyone who's using the Linux kernel.

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,320
Now so far, this new performance code has only landed in the kernel's work in progress

37
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,540
branch for the block subsystem.

38
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,720
But much if not all of it should land, fingers crossed, in Linux 5.16.

39
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,000
Now that said, Linux 5.15 is not even out yet, but it did enter its final RC phase early

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,260
Monday morning.

41
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,840
Much like today's episode of Linux Action News, the RC release was a day late.

42
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,480
Linus does tend to release on Sundays, but he was traveling this week and as he noted,

43
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,320
his Sunday release was quote, spoiled by me spending more time in an airplane without

44
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
Wi-Fi.

45
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,200
Well, that's not a lot of fun, but it's a whole lot better than the release being delayed

46
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,400
by actual issues with the kernel.

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,400
Heyo.

48
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,760
Linus did note that RC 7 of 5.15 looks quote, nice and small, right in the range of normal.

49
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,600
He went on to say that both the number of commits and the diff stat looks fine.

50
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,560
It's all pretty small and flat, meaning mostly small trivial changes, with just a couple

51
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,160
of peaks for some x86 KVM code and some KSMBD changes.

52
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,640
Excellent.

53
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,840
Good.

54
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,400
Let the KSMBD changes flow.

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,640
Still the craziest thing they ever let in the kernel.

56
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,280
You call it crazy, I call it brilliant.

57
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,440
As for when we might actually get to play with it, Michael Larible over at Ferronix

58
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,160
noted that at this stage, 5.15 is looking quite good, and it seems likely it should

59
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,160
debut next Sunday.

60
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:39,080
However, as Linus will again be traveling next week, he is inclined, if the need presents

61
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:46,240
itself to delay the 5.15 release to then hopefully avoid the Linux 5.16 merge window during his

62
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,660
next round of travels.

63
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:54,600
But looking ahead to Linux 5.16, we see two important sets of patches out there for those

64
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,760
of you who might want to use Linux on a shiny new M1 Mac, which I plan to test out and even

65
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,960
perhaps deploy.

66
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,360
We shall see how that goes.

67
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,080
But yeah, it looks like a PCIe driver for the M1 systems will land in 5.16 and support

68
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,480
the 2021 Apple Magic Keyboard as well.

69
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,220
Now we should probably mention there's no Touch ID sensor support just yet that wasn't

70
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,600
in the scope of this work, but everything else is looking pretty darn good.

71
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,440
The PCIe-Apple driver, as it's known, was reverse engineered by Alyssa Rosenzweig and

72
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:36,040
Marc SolgÃ©, was also based on previous work from Corellium and OpenBSD.

73
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,600
This is some impressive work in fewer than 1000 lines of new code in the kernel.

74
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,720
You know, I haven't measured this, but I get the impression just from watching the kernel

75
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:51,420
development news that support for the Apple devices is landing faster at a more aggressive

76
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,420
clip.

77
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,720
And you just wouldn't have thought it was going to go this way when Apple announced

78
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,000
their own closed ecosystem and they were tightening down even further.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,280
But it seems like things are better for anyone than ever if they want to run a Mac using

80
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
Linux.

81
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
Yeah, I know.

82
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,740
It's weird how in this new closed era where they've got to design things however they

83
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,400
want and not have to play ball with the Intel side of things, how is that easier for Linux?

84
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,520
But somehow it seems to be working out really well.

85
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,560
Fingers crossed, though, who knows what might happen in the future?

86
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,960
Yeah, what happens in the future will always be that big question hanging over the platform

87
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,240
for Linux users.

88
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
We just won't know.

89
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,320
We'll see.

90
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,640
But this PCIe driver that's getting in shape for 5.16 looks like it does a lot more than

91
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,460
just bring PCI Express up, which it does, and that is important.

92
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:46,440
But it was also the prerequisite for bringing up the USB type A ports, Ethernet, Wi-Fi and

93
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,000
Bluetooth on Apple M1 Mac minis and MacBooks.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,360
You know, like any of the useful ports.

95
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Yeah.

96
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
So good.

97
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,880
It really tells me that any Linux distro that's going to work on the M1 is probably

98
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,360
going to need to be 5.16 based and it's just so awesome to see them work on this.

99
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,240
I mean, this is three teams that worked on this and it's all going upstream for all of

100
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,440
us to use.

101
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,560
Popping up the stack just a bit.

102
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,040
It's been an exciting week for KDE developers who've been preparing the Plasma Wayland session

103
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,360
to work with NVIDIA's new GBM support in their binary driver.

104
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:30,840
KDE Plasma 5.23.2 and up will support the GBM backend required to work with recent driver

105
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,680
updates by NVIDIA that enable full Wayland support.

106
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,160
Yeah, NVIDIA added support for this on their end for GBM with the 4.95 driver.

107
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,840
Along these same lines Fedora 35 will be shipping soon featuring GBM with Wayland to use with

108
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,840
GNOME Shell.

109
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,560
And looking ahead to Plasma 5.24, I'm sure you'll be happy to see that fingerprint support

110
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,760
is finally landing.

111
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,280
Oh, another week.

112
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Another happy dance.

113
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
Two weeks in a row.

114
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,280
Yeah, this is great.

115
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,040
And this support will allow for unlocking the screen and authenticating those pseudo

116
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
prompts.

117
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,400
I enjoy that a lot when using GNOME on my ThinkPad right now.

118
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,000
It just, it feels high end and fancy and well integrated.

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,040
Definitely some good improvements inbound, plenty of things for us to keep our eyes on

120
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,760
and review sometime in the future.

121
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,320

126
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,520
They started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing.

127
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,560
Now 18 years later, they are the largest independent open cloud provider in the world with 11 global

128
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,240
data centers serving nearly a million customers.

129
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,080
But they still remain focused on making cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible

130
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
to all.

131
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,420
They really have the best in class experience.

132
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,800
That's why we host everything on Linode now.

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,600
Ting has nationwide coverage, a great mix of plans, and super fast LTE and 5G, depending

142
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,120
on your area.

143
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
They're straightforward.

144
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,560
They're simple to understand plans.

145
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,080
I've been a Tink customer since 2013, and there's one reason and one reason only.

146
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,120
Ting's a great value, and maybe there's two reasons.

147
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
They're flexible.

148
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
Okay, maybe there's three reasons.

149
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,920
They have really good customer support.

150
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay, maybe there's four reasons because they also have a great dashboard.

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,800
Five reasons they have lots of networks to choose from.

152
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,160
Six reasons they also have really great customer support and community.

153
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,640
Did I already say that one?

154
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,040
I really just want you to focus on the one thing though, whichever one of those matters

155
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
the most for you.

156
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,840
Go try it out and see what I'm talking about.

157
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,280
It's so great, and every plan gets access to Ting's award-winning customer service,

158
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,480
nationwide LTE and 5G, and of course, no contracts ever.

159
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
How about that?

160
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,540
The freedom of no contracts.

161
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,540
That's pretty sweet.

162
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,160
So just head to linux.ting.com.

163
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,200
Check your current phone, create an account, and pick the plan that's right for you.

164
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
Ting will send you a SIM card.

165
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,320
You pop that in your phone, and you can get activated in minutes.

166
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,680
They've got a great dashboard.

167
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,040
Just get started by going to linux.ting.com.

168
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,520
It's the next generation of Ting mobile.

169
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,520
It's here.

170
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:38,080
Go see how much you could save and get 25 bucks off that, linux.ting.com.

171
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,280
This week, we learned of a new GPL lawsuit that could have some real implications for

172
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,720
all of us.

173
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,720
The Software Freedom Conservancy, or SFC for short, a non-profit organization that promotes

174
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,920
open-source software and defends the general public license, has sued TV maker Vizio for

175
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
GPL violations.

176
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:04,800
The SFC is suing Vizio because its SmartCast OS is based on Linux, uses U-Boot, TAR, glibc,

177
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,280
ffmpeg, and a whole bunch of other free software.

178
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,920
But Vizio is not making the sources available, as is required by the GPL.

179
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,160
This news probably doesn't really come as a surprise to anyone listening to this show.

180
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,860
There have been attempts to get Vizio to address this since 2018.

181
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,680
The Conservancy engaged in at least a year-long attempt of diplomacy to get them to understand

182
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,200
the terms of the GPL and, well, nothing.

183
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,780
What is a bit surprising about this case, though, is that the SFC is taking a new approach.

184
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,840
The lawsuit is being made as the purchaser of a product, which illegally contains copylefted

185
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
code.

186
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,680
This new approach makes it the first legal case that focuses on the rights of individual

187
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,760
consumers as third-party GPL beneficiaries.

188
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,620
According to this lawsuit, you as the buyer also have the right to access that source

189
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,620
code.

190
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,520
I like this, and I'd love to see this tested, and I mean, I'm a little nervous about seeing

191
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,440
it tested, but I still want to see it tested.

192
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,640
There is a real right to repair element to this, even if you're not a developer.

193
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,440
Getting access to this source code could give you vital bits of information when attempting

194
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,560
to make repairs years down the road.

195
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,560
No kidding.

196
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,240
Otherwise, it's just a black box.

197
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,720
I think the SFC hopes to demonstrate that it's not just the copyright holders, but also

198
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,320
the users who are entitled to rights.

199
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,800
You also have the fact that eventually, Visio will just abandon this product and its software.

200
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,640
Sometimes vendors deactivate devices when they no longer want to support them.

201
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,160
But most of the time, they just silently stop updating them and just hope you won't notice.

202
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,800
The open source community could step up in some cases for popular products, and we could

203
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,520
support them years beyond what the original vendor might be willing to do.

204
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,800
We have seen so many examples of that.

205
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,400
The hardware works just fine, but the software is out of support.

206
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:01,760
Karen Sandler of the SFC pointed out this issue is even hotter right now, saying, quote,

207
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,940
the global supply chain shortages that have affected everything from cars to consumer

208
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,400
electronics underscores one of the reasons why it's important to be able to repair products

209
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,600
we already own.

210
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,880
She goes on to say, even without supply chain challenges, the forced obsolescence of devices

211
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,320
like TVs isn't in the best interest of the consumer, or even the planet.

212
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,680
Hmm, fair points indeed.

213
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,760
I think it's noteworthy that the lawsuit seeks no monetary damages.

214
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,440
Instead, it's only asking that Visio give access to the technical information that the

215
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,800
copyleft license has always required.

216
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,320
We'll definitely keep our eyes on this and everything else going on in the world of Linux

217
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,400
and open source.
