00:00.000 --> 00:08.680
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 235, recorded on April 5th, 2022.

00:08.680 --> 00:09.920
I'm Chris.

00:09.920 --> 00:10.920
And I'm Wes.

00:10.920 --> 00:11.920
Hello, Wes!

00:11.920 --> 00:13.800
Let's do the news.

00:13.800 --> 00:17.280
And we start with some good news, everyone!

00:17.280 --> 00:20.000
At least for the Docker fans out there.

00:20.000 --> 00:25.120
But for those of you on the Docker Inc. Death Watch instead, well, it seems you'll just

00:25.120 --> 00:27.940
have to wait a little bit longer.

00:27.940 --> 00:36.160
The embattled containerization company this week announced a $105 million Series C funding

00:36.160 --> 00:39.480
round, led by Bain Capital Ventures.

00:39.480 --> 00:47.000
That brings its total funding to $163 million and a company valuation of $2.1 billion.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.800
These valuations still make no sense.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.440
That's that's 2.3 Linux.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.140
That's what they're saying Docker is worth.

00:53.140 --> 00:58.880
And yet, you're not kidding, Wes, analysts have been circling like vultures over Docker

00:58.880 --> 01:04.000
expecting them any day to announce the collapse of the commercial structure around Docker.

01:04.000 --> 01:09.640
And here, the folks at Bain Capital are willing to sink a whole bunch of more money into it.

01:09.640 --> 01:13.160
But you know, doesn't mean that page after page of clickbait won't still be written

01:13.160 --> 01:15.960
about Docker's limited days ahead.

01:15.960 --> 01:18.100
And there is some credibility to it.

01:18.100 --> 01:21.560
We have indeed seen major restructures at the Docker company.

01:21.560 --> 01:26.220
We absolutely have seen some flipping between various product focuses trying to find some

01:26.220 --> 01:28.840
traction in the market somewhere where they can make money.

01:28.840 --> 01:34.880
But when you read between the lines, it really seems like the investors are more hyped about

01:34.880 --> 01:40.240
the software market's overall growth potential than they are necessarily about Docker, except

01:40.240 --> 01:44.600
for the fact that Docker Inc. is just seen as one of the companies that is selling the

01:44.600 --> 01:49.280
shovels to this next wave of software developers they see coming.

01:49.280 --> 01:53.720
For the company's part in the announcement for this latest round of funding, Docker's

01:53.720 --> 01:59.960
CEO said, quote, together, we have focused on the needs of developers to help them quickly

01:59.960 --> 02:05.480
and safely build, share, and run any app, anywhere.

02:05.480 --> 02:10.460
As tens of millions of new developers join the market this decade, this funding enables

02:10.460 --> 02:16.160
us to go faster in solving problems for the next generation.

02:16.160 --> 02:20.720
Docker also said it has about more than 56,000 commercial customers.

02:20.720 --> 02:25.760
But overall, Docker didn't really go into specifics about how this new investment money

02:25.760 --> 02:26.760
will be used.

02:26.760 --> 02:31.320
In fact, when you read through their announcement, one kind of gets the impression that maybe

02:31.320 --> 02:36.680
this investment money is going to just simply cover the bills and keep the lights on.

02:36.680 --> 02:43.520
Meanwhile, the folks behind the LexD project have been hard at work on the latest stable

02:43.520 --> 02:47.320
release of their system container and virtual machine manager.

02:47.320 --> 02:54.160
Yeah, this is often an overlooked tool, but it really has grown just a robust set of features

02:54.160 --> 02:58.080
and a really nice, dependable, stable support lifecycle.

02:58.080 --> 03:02.920
Yeah, I think that's highlighted in their release announcement where they say, quote,

03:02.920 --> 03:09.500
this is our fourth LTS release and quite an exciting one for anyone coming from LexD 4.0,

03:09.500 --> 03:16.580
as it significantly steps up LexD's abilities, especially when operating in a clustered environment.

03:16.580 --> 03:21.480
As with all our other LTS releases, this one will be supported for five years, until June

03:21.480 --> 03:28.880
2027, and will receive a number of bugfix and security point releases over that time.

03:28.880 --> 03:33.880
LexD is really known for an impressive backwards compatibility story, but things do change

03:33.880 --> 03:38.840
over time and it seems they're making some adjustments they write in the release.

03:38.840 --> 03:42.420
This just became increasingly costly, the amount of code we had to keep around to handle

03:42.420 --> 03:44.080
data migration.

03:44.080 --> 03:48.900
This was also causing us to keep depending on old dependencies that have gone unmaintained

03:48.900 --> 03:52.760
for years and becoming a potential security risk.

03:52.760 --> 04:00.300
As a result, LexD 5.0 was changed to only support upgrading from LexD 4.0 or higher.

04:00.300 --> 04:07.220
But boy, is it worth an upgrade because a lot has happened since that last LTS, including

04:07.220 --> 04:13.360
and definitely not least, virtual machine support is effectively at feature parity with

04:13.360 --> 04:14.680
containers now.

04:14.680 --> 04:21.420
That includes stuff like virtual TPM support, arbitrary PCI device pass through, and even

04:21.420 --> 04:40.520
live migration and stateful snapshots.

04:40.520 --> 04:46.520
Now for a change that the open source community is getting a front row seat to.

04:46.520 --> 04:51.560
It's the overhaul of Fedora's installer, which ultimately means the overhaul of the

04:51.560 --> 04:54.120
Red Hat Enterprise Linux installer as well.

04:54.120 --> 04:58.760
Indeed, we covered this originally in January when we said, hey, this is in the works.

04:58.760 --> 05:02.520
And it seems that the team has been reviewing the feedback since then and has also been

05:02.520 --> 05:05.240
running usability studies over the last few years.

05:05.240 --> 05:09.120
And they're bringing it all together in a design review process.

05:09.120 --> 05:16.360
And seems that some of the feedback indicated their current hub and spoke design was a bit

05:16.360 --> 05:17.360
confusing.

05:17.360 --> 05:22.320
They note that users were having some difficulty understanding the selection options on the

05:22.320 --> 05:27.280
hub screen and also determining which spoke steps to take to complete the installation.

05:27.280 --> 05:30.120
Yeah, I think you'd probably agree with that, Wes.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.000
Oh, yeah, definitely.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.280
It seems that their new approach is more of an install wizard look, something that users

05:37.280 --> 05:40.380
are probably going to be a little bit more familiar with.

05:40.380 --> 05:45.120
And in a community blog post, they note that the advantages of this new approach are quote,

05:45.120 --> 05:50.800
it supports a guided step by step workflow that allows users to focus on discrete tasks.

05:50.800 --> 05:57.180
A wizard helps break down otherwise complex tasks into a series of small, simple steps.

05:57.180 --> 06:02.320
Now it is still early days here, but this is pretty encouraging to see.

06:02.320 --> 06:06.560
You know, I've never been a huge fan of the current version of Anaconda, but I have to

06:06.560 --> 06:08.280
admit there's a lot of good bones there.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.320
There's a lot of good pieces that they have, especially some of that, you know, like the

06:11.320 --> 06:15.480
new updated disk partitioning tool that they've built and obviously just a lot of the low

06:15.480 --> 06:16.480
level pieces.

06:16.480 --> 06:21.680
So it's kind of refreshing seeing the team being willing to take this criticism, look

06:21.680 --> 06:29.520
at other ideas and also be really transparent about the whole thing.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.480
While we're talking about Fedora, the team is brainstorming a possible GUI based Linux

06:33.480 --> 06:35.040
recovery environment.

06:35.040 --> 06:39.160
Yeah, Michael Lauderdale over at Ferronix flagged this one.

06:39.160 --> 06:44.040
And it sure seems like it could be a nice compliment to Fedora's existing command line

06:44.040 --> 06:46.480
based recovery environment.

06:46.480 --> 06:51.880
We should note though that currently this is in the would be nice to have stage.

06:51.880 --> 06:56.800
But it does seem like there is some genuine planning happening behind the scenes.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.680
Wouldn't this be great to see?

06:58.680 --> 07:02.720
Because you start layering tools on like this, right?

07:02.720 --> 07:07.520
Maybe create a tool that can help fix an unbootable system or maybe it even has the ability to

07:07.520 --> 07:13.200
browse and select previous snapshots, while also the team is building tools on top of

07:13.200 --> 07:16.720
ButterFS and integrating DNF snapshot support.

07:16.720 --> 07:21.200
We've got Flatpaks that are delivering applications and the underlying system upgrades have been

07:21.200 --> 07:23.040
getting better and better.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.920
So you start seeing like all of this layer together and what you get is like this next

07:26.920 --> 07:33.600
level of reliability, a real kind of bulletproof reliability that's just an unbeatable feature

07:33.600 --> 07:38.840
in enterprise desktops.

07:38.840 --> 07:44.080
Everyone's favorite open source firmware update tool, FlopD, has a new release this

07:44.080 --> 07:45.240
week.

07:45.240 --> 07:50.800
Most notable this time around is support for some Logitech mice and keyboards, Wacom panels

07:50.800 --> 07:58.920
on Lenovo laptops, and some additional support for fingerprint readers.

07:58.920 --> 08:04.280
Lutris the long running open source game manager that I personally love and works across various

08:04.280 --> 08:09.760
stores and platforms has released version 0.5.10 this week.

08:09.760 --> 08:15.700
And what's notable is this version features initial Steam Deck support.

08:15.700 --> 08:20.280
That Steam Deck support is partially thanks to their collaboration with Valve after receiving

08:20.280 --> 08:23.560
a Steam Deck development kit.

08:23.560 --> 08:28.760
Now Lutris's Flatpak version that's still being worked on right now is the next step

08:28.760 --> 08:31.360
in better Steam Deck support.

08:31.360 --> 08:35.400
Until that's fully baked, installing Lutris on the Deck actually requires putting the

08:35.400 --> 08:40.640
root file system in read write mode, at least for getting things installed initially.

08:40.640 --> 08:43.640
That's a little unfortunate.

08:43.640 --> 08:47.920
You can understand something like Lutris, it needs access to all kinds of things on

08:47.920 --> 08:53.580
your system for just a wide variety of types of games and hardware that it supports.

08:53.580 --> 08:58.440
But in turn that means that this could be at risk of the install getting wiped out during

08:58.440 --> 09:03.320
the next SteamOS update because of the read-only nature of the SteamOS system.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.960
But we'll have more on that in a moment because I think what I wanted to mention that struck

09:06.960 --> 09:11.720
me about this is we have talked about this, the Deck's ability to run even competitor

09:11.720 --> 09:14.840
software and competing app stores and whatnot.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.320
Just the ability to run applications.

09:17.320 --> 09:21.800
But here we are seeing it in the real world and it's still just so novel and rare that

09:21.800 --> 09:27.220
a hardware device like this will support running something like Lutris or another installer

09:27.220 --> 09:29.760
that you know maybe Valve isn't even a big fan of internally.

09:29.760 --> 09:34.600
And I don't know if this is ever going to materialize into some use case that we never

09:34.600 --> 09:37.480
saw but now the Deck is super popular for.

09:37.480 --> 09:41.840
But I would just be thrilled if even some of the sales here were attributed to the fact

09:41.840 --> 09:46.280
that people knew they could buy the Deck and install whatever emulator they wanted to

09:46.280 --> 09:49.660
play their favorite Nintendo game or their favorite retro game.

09:49.660 --> 09:54.320
If this just became known as the device that lets you play anything on the go and because

09:54.320 --> 09:58.640
of its open nature it got there, I think you could see a new trend being set in the industry.

09:58.640 --> 10:03.840
I know that's pie in the sky but I think you see the early framework being laid right

10:03.840 --> 10:05.480
here for that.

10:05.480 --> 10:12.040
And here I thought you were just getting excited about running MS Access via Wine on the go.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.400
That too of course.

10:13.400 --> 10:19.160
Now as far as gaming features go, 0.5.10 also adds support for integration with games installed

10:19.160 --> 10:22.040
via Origin and Ubisoft Connect.

10:22.040 --> 10:27.960
There's also a new UI window for adding games directly to Lutris amongst a variety of other

10:27.960 --> 10:32.280
improvements.

10:32.280 --> 10:33.840
Linode.com slash LAN.

10:33.840 --> 10:38.000
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support this

10:38.000 --> 10:39.200
here show.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.360
Linode is definitely the Linux geeks cloud.

10:41.360 --> 10:45.040
They've got 11 data centers worldwide and they've been hard at work in making Linode

10:45.040 --> 10:49.960
the best experience for 19 years and they started with a passion for Linux.

10:49.960 --> 10:55.360
And this week I've had a whole new appreciation for getting a passion around databases.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.680
Just critical to the applications we run.

10:57.680 --> 10:58.680
And now I get it.

10:58.680 --> 11:01.840
Now I see why Linode has been rolling out hosted MySQL services.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.760
I got to say I'm super tempted.

11:03.760 --> 11:10.000
It just it's nice to have the experience, the performance and the reliability of Linode.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
You know I mean I could sit here and tell you too it's like they're great support.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.280
It's really all of those things.

11:14.280 --> 11:18.120
They just are fantastic and they're always rolling out new features and getting better

11:18.120 --> 11:19.120
than ever.

11:19.120 --> 11:22.240
So go grab $100 in credit and try it out for yourself.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.880
See why we like it so much.

11:23.880 --> 11:28.520
From the best customer support, super fast networking and a Linux culture that runs deep,

11:28.520 --> 11:30.400
there's a lot of great reasons to choose Linode.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.440
So put it over the top.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.440
Linode dot com slash LAN.

11:33.440 --> 11:38.800
Support the show and get $100 in credit.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.480
Linux dot ting dot com.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.440
Are you sick of overpaying for your cell service?

11:42.440 --> 11:43.440
I know I was.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.840
So go see how much you could save and then take $25 off of that.

11:46.840 --> 11:50.640
Linux dot ting dot com, they're a mobile virtual network operator, so they're focusing

11:50.640 --> 11:55.920
on the customer relationship, the value, the great plans, not digging the holes, not letting

11:55.920 --> 11:56.920
the pockets of the regulators.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.880
None of that stuff the duopolies have to do, but they get access to the big nationwide

12:00.880 --> 12:03.580
networks and they have great customer service.

12:03.580 --> 12:08.240
In fact Ting was just recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports in 2021 and

12:08.240 --> 12:09.800
their plans are simple and straightforward.

12:09.800 --> 12:15.000
It's one of the reasons why I've been a customer since 2013 and indeed their customer support

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
has come through when I have needed it.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.600
And I love the fact there's no contracts, so for some reason it actually makes me want

12:20.600 --> 12:21.600
to stick around more.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.320
And it's simple to switch to Ting just about any phone's going to work.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.320
So go try it.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.960
Linux dot ting dot com.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.520
Mobile's never been simpler.

12:28.520 --> 12:29.760
It's how it should be.

12:29.760 --> 12:34.440
Linux dot ting dot com.

12:34.440 --> 12:41.400
With the release of Lutris 0.5.10 and the release of the Steam Deck in general, a debate

12:41.400 --> 12:44.840
seems to be brewing in the community.

12:44.840 --> 12:51.240
One that goes to the core of the Linux user experience and asks the fundamental question,

12:51.240 --> 12:54.840
who are we building the desktop for?

12:54.840 --> 13:01.280
This was all kind of sparked by the developer of Lutris himself, Matthew Commandon.

13:01.280 --> 13:06.780
In a tweet he said quote, we gotta stop this culture of only install flat packs, using

13:06.780 --> 13:13.960
root is dangerous, before it extends beyond the Steam Deck.

13:13.960 --> 13:20.560
One thing I want is for desktop Linux to become like Android or Chrome OS.

13:20.560 --> 13:25.480
And then later on he continued, on flat pack, apps don't have permission to access your

13:25.480 --> 13:26.480
stuff.

13:26.480 --> 13:29.080
It renders them much less useful than native ones.

13:29.080 --> 13:34.520
I have a command to run to give all flat packs permissions to the whole file system to circumvent

13:34.520 --> 13:35.520
this issue.

13:35.520 --> 13:41.900
I'll add this, I think, you know, Matthew joined us in Linux Unplugged episode 399.

13:41.900 --> 13:45.760
And I still reflect back on that conversation pretty frequently.

13:45.760 --> 13:50.360
And I believe from what I know of Matthew, he has users best interest in mind here.

13:50.360 --> 13:55.080
He doesn't want to take away power, just in the name of making things easier, safer.

13:55.080 --> 13:58.920
He's probably amongst the crowd that really believes there's a way to strike the balance

13:58.920 --> 13:59.920
here.

13:59.920 --> 14:03.680
And I think that's, I think that's actually a pretty reasonable position.

14:03.680 --> 14:09.640
But I gotta say the reaction from the community was a lot stronger than I expected.

14:09.640 --> 14:15.240
Yeah, there have been more than a few hot takes in the last couple days.

14:15.240 --> 14:20.600
It kind of seems like we're getting back to something of a classic debate, though.

14:20.600 --> 14:27.320
You know, the free software community has limited time and limited resources, and we

14:27.320 --> 14:30.560
have to choose how we spend them.

14:30.560 --> 14:35.720
Do we build things for expert users, for ourselves, for the users who are here and passionate

14:35.720 --> 14:39.560
and know how to get things going themselves who can already put up with the state of

14:39.560 --> 14:40.960
desktop Linux?

14:40.960 --> 14:45.920
Or do we spend that time building for what we hope is the next million users, you know,

14:45.920 --> 14:50.040
folks who have different requirements, and who might need a little more help?

14:50.040 --> 14:51.760
Yeah, that's probably it.

14:51.760 --> 14:56.680
It's not really a flat pack or snaps or universal apps are bad debate.

14:56.680 --> 15:00.100
I mean, that might be the context right now.

15:00.100 --> 15:05.040
But it's it's really a debate about making desktop Linux more or less like Chrome OS

15:05.040 --> 15:06.120
or Android.

15:06.120 --> 15:11.160
And I think the thing that's new here is the deck is an irritant to this debate.

15:11.160 --> 15:15.160
It's forcing our community to take a look at this issue again in a new way.

15:15.160 --> 15:19.660
Yeah, once again, we walk down this path of Oh, gosh, look, it's Linux.

15:19.660 --> 15:23.360
It's trying to be deployed desktop Linux out in the field.

15:23.360 --> 15:27.440
But yeah, like with Android, like with Chrome OS, it also kind of makes us a little uncomfortable

15:27.440 --> 15:30.200
because it's, well, it's not how we would do it.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.720
It's not how we would build the systems we'd make for ourselves.

15:33.720 --> 15:38.300
There's also of course, sort of the tertiary discussion around just security on the desktop

15:38.300 --> 15:41.820
in general, we've seen these other platforms kind of, you know, take a new approach where

15:41.820 --> 15:46.040
they are adding a lot more sandboxing and then having to, to build up new abstractions

15:46.040 --> 15:48.440
and protocols to help share information.

15:48.440 --> 15:55.320
So we don't have to do workarounds like granting everything access to the whole system.

15:55.320 --> 16:01.080
But you know, I do think we should acknowledge those are those are good goals, at least in

16:01.080 --> 16:05.360
my opinion, but we haven't finished building that world.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.400
We're not all the way in the same place say iOS is.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.520
And it means that, you know, it can be tricky to get right.

16:11.520 --> 16:15.040
And even if it is a safer system for users, doesn't mean that they're still gonna be able

16:15.040 --> 16:16.960
to do everything that they want to.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.960
Yeah, that's a good point, too.

16:18.960 --> 16:24.200
It's like you can build a system very much like how iOS or Android have built it.

16:24.200 --> 16:30.640
But then you also have to have this just complex ecosystem of API's and ways of accommodating

16:30.640 --> 16:33.400
rich application development in such a locked down system.

16:33.400 --> 16:37.360
And we could get there, but it's going to have to be more than XTG portals, right?

16:37.360 --> 16:41.280
And I just don't know if we'll actually have the resources to make that a complete usable

16:41.280 --> 16:42.560
environment.

16:42.560 --> 16:48.480
But at the same time, like I don't have anything against one particular project or company

16:48.480 --> 16:53.380
given a go at doing this, you know, let's let Valve have a go and see how it turns out.

16:53.380 --> 16:57.520
It's one of the reasons I'm so curious about getting my hands on Steam OS 3 and running

16:57.520 --> 16:58.520
it on a PC.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.900
What is that like?

16:59.900 --> 17:02.480
How long can I survive on a system that's read only?

17:02.480 --> 17:04.400
I'm really curious about that.

17:04.400 --> 17:07.040
And I want to see them experiment.

17:07.040 --> 17:10.060
And I just think that this is just getting to be really uncomfortable for some folks

17:10.060 --> 17:15.520
in the community now, because, like, there's users here now on this kind of platform.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.060
They want Lutris.

17:17.060 --> 17:19.920
And I can totally see where Matthew's coming from.

17:19.920 --> 17:25.320
And the uncomfortable fact is, well, these more locked down devices that run Linux, like

17:25.320 --> 17:31.280
the Chrome OS devices, like the Android devices, they they seem to be wildly popular amongst

17:31.280 --> 17:32.280
consumers.

17:32.280 --> 17:33.280
Right.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.680
And we're just sitting here going, but but it's not really that great.

17:36.680 --> 17:39.800
And for some for some customers, it absolutely is.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.080
But let them have it.

17:41.080 --> 17:46.280
You know, as long as we continue to have choice in the Linux distro ecosystem, I don't think

17:46.280 --> 17:47.600
this is going to be a problem.

17:47.600 --> 17:52.640
Yeah, we're not yet at a spot where, you know, having switched things to read write means

17:52.640 --> 17:55.640
that the anti-cheat stops working.

17:55.640 --> 17:56.640
That would get me concerned.

17:56.640 --> 18:02.280
But, you know, just having it write only to start with, I think we can work with that.

18:02.280 --> 18:08.100
And if not, well, you can put whatever Linux distro you want on there.

18:08.100 --> 18:09.100
Very true, Wes.

18:09.100 --> 18:13.440
And if one thing will always remain a constant, there's always going to be someone out there

18:13.440 --> 18:14.440
scratching an itch.

18:14.440 --> 18:19.520
So there will always be choice, even for the most nichey of niches.

18:19.520 --> 18:20.800
And we'll keep an eye on all of them.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.520
So why don't you keep an eye on us?

18:39.820 --> 18:42.240
slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

18:42.240 --> 18:47.760
We'll be back next week with our take on the latest Linux and open source news.

18:47.760 --> 18:48.760
Thanks for joining us.
