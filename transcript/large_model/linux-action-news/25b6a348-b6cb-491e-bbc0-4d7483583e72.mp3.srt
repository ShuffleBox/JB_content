00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,160
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,320
This is episode 40, recorded on February 11th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,320
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,320
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,320
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,720
It's good to be connected with you, and it's great to start the week off with some really

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,720
good news.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,480
We have a whole batch of new open source project releases.

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,400
And let's start with the Mate desktop.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,580
Yeah, Mate 1.20.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,460
And this is a pretty huge release for them, because it finally gets high DPI sorted out.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,920
This desktop, it's all about the traditional paradigm, is going to have one of the first

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,720
class implementations of high DPI.

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,740
I mean, we're talking auto detection, hinting for cute applications, so they also automatically

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,520
scale up.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,920
Even the login screen supports high DPI and automatically detects it.

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,560
And this is going to be available in Ubuntu Mate 1804, isn't it?

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,560
Right.

19
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,960
So it's going to be part of Mate 1.20, which will ship in Ubuntu Mate 1804.

20
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,800
And it's one of these features, because they've done it so well, you won't even notice, because

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,200
you won't have to do anything.

22
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,640
Your desktop will just look right.

23
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,680
I must say, it's very appealing to me now, as someone who's been stuck on XFCE, I'll

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,560
probably be on XFCE again for Ubuntu 1804, so I'll be on Xubuntu for that.

25
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:35,680
But looking at the way Mate has really developed, it's looking really good.

26
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,640
And it feels like a really solid backup plan for me at this point.

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,520
So Martin Wimpress joined me on last week's Linux Unplugged.

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,840
And he really laid out the two year journey that the Mate project has been on to get the

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,960
desktop here.

30
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,760
And it's incredible work that's gone here, because it's involved bringing the desktop

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,720
up to GTK 3, getting the themes and artwork ready, working across multiple projects to

32
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,720
get all of this stuff tied together.

33
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,740
And this is just really scratching the surface of Mate 1.20.

34
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,040
There's tons of other really great features in there.

35
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,520
Yeah, significant improvements to window tiling with drag to quadrant, which is useful.

36
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,640
And I think another huge one is the global menu support, which they've been working on

37
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,960
for a while, but now seems to be fully baked into it.

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,920
So I know that X Unity users are going to be grateful for that one.

39
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,000
I think the Mate project very cleverly has been sneaking improvements in there to entice

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,880
Unity users that are looking for a new GTK home.

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,380
And specifically, the Ubuntu Mate project has brought a lot of that all together.

42
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,680
But speaking of support for global menus, and perhaps a totally different desktop for

43
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:49,120
some of those Unity users like me, Plasma has a new release, version 5.12, which also

44
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,760
happens to be a long term support.

45
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,760
And I'm using it right now as we do this show.

46
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,560
Yeah, I've heard you gushing about this on Linux Unplugged.

47
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,720
So here we are several days later, are you still as happy with it as you were?

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,760
Happier, yeah.

49
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,160
So I've upgraded all of my machines now to 5.12.

50
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,480
I've been using KDE Neon User Edition.

51
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,080
It's one of those upgrades really where if you didn't know it was happening, you almost

52
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,760
would have noticed nothing, just a couple of things got better.

53
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,820
Probably my favorite thing I noticed right away is I can now highlight the notification

54
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:25,480
text when notifications come up, which that system in itself has gotten really good in

55
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,760
the last few Plasma desktop releases.

56
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,080
I'm really picky about notifications, and I have that thing dialed in.

57
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,720
And so when things come up and I can highlight text from it, love it.

58
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,080
It was one of those features I just stumbled across.

59
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,480
It was intuitive.

60
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,800
It was the kind of thing that thrills you when you run into it.

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,040
And another big one is night color, which now works on Wayland doing the same job that

62
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,640
Redshift does with X, which makes the screen kind of have a more reddy tint at night and

63
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,220
a bluey tint in the morning, which I know a lot of people use.

64
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,640
So that's really good to see that they're pushing this Wayland stuff forward.

65
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,800
And it's not just that, is it?

66
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,520
I mean, they really are concentrating on Wayland now.

67
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,120
I use that feature, love it, have not tried it on Plasma yet.

68
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,160
I really recommend it.

69
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,880
If your phone supports that or your desktop supports it, Gnome desktop supports this as

70
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
well.

71
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,820
Or like Joe said, you could install Redshift.

72
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,820
Try that out.

73
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:21,000
But yeah, so this is an interesting feature because they're touting it as a Wayland exclusive.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,960
Welcome to our new Wayland reality, everybody, where now we have features that you only get

75
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,520
when you use Wayland.

76
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,520
And it makes sense.

77
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,800
I understand why when you're implementing something like this.

78
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,800
I like it actually.

79
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,520
You know, in a way I kind of wish Plasma would get worse and worse rather than better and

80
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,520
better because I'm inevitably going to have to switch away from XFC at some point, I think.

81
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,160
The development is just too slow.

82
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,400
It's not going to catch up with GTK3 and Wayland.

83
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,600
I'd love to be proven wrong on that because I really want to stay on it.

84
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,800
But my backup plan has always been Marte, right?

85
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,500
But now looking at Plasma, it seems like it's got equally as much to offer and I just feel

86
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
so conflicted.

87
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,720
If I'm going to make a change, yeah, I could try one or the other, but I just can't see

88
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,360
myself picking between them because they seem to be in different ways just great desktops.

89
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,920
Well let me tell you two things.

90
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:18,640
Number one is this Wayland support that they're baking in now is officially in an LTS release,

91
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,680
which means they're going to be working and improving this for years.

92
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,380
That's going to make their Wayland support top notch just in itself.

93
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:30,440
But the second thing, podcaster to podcaster, there is a feature that I love.

94
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,880
You know when you're doing a show and all of a sudden one of your applications or a

95
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,320
tab in your browser just goes crazy and starts playing music or starts making noise?

96
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Yep.

97
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
I know that nightmare scenario.

98
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,600
Well, one of the great things in Plasma Desktop now is applications that are currently playing

99
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,240
audio are now marked with a little speaker icon down in the task manager and you can

100
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,440
right click on it, just like in modern browsers tabs, you can right click on it and mute the

101
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,400
entire application from the task manager.

102
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,000
Boom, kill it.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Nice.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,640
That's a feature I'd love to have on Xfce, yeah.

105
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,360
But it's not just desktops getting major releases this week, is it?

106
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,200
There's also VLC, which is 3.0.0.

107
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,480
A huge release of VLC this week.

108
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,760
Let's just go down some of my favorite features right off the top of my head.

109
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,720
We now have Chromecast support built in.

110
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,720
If you've got one of those, that's pretty handy.

111
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,240
But the number one feature for me, now that I'm coincidentally on the Plasma desktop,

112
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,080
it supports playing files from over network shares, like an SMB share.

113
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,240
So GNOME users, when you would browse your network and you double click on a Samba share

114
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,940
that maybe has your files in it, in the background, GNOME uses GVFS to mount that to your local

115
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,000
file system and then applications just think they're browsing a folder way deep in your

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,440
home directory and they launch the file.

117
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,280
But on the Plasma desktop, there's this whole KIO and KO slave system where it's making

118
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
a remote connection to the server and it's aware that it's a remote connection and it

119
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,120
doesn't do this back end kind of sneaky file system mount.

120
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,160
And applications had to be aware of this KIO system, this communication layer.

121
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm probably getting some of this wrong, but my rough understanding is applications had

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,560
to write support for it, like maybe Dragon Player.

123
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,740
But applications like VLC, if you tried to play a large movie file over network share,

124
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,680
in the background, the Plasma desktop would begin transferring that file.

125
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,880
So in my case, maybe like a 20 gigabyte file would start transferring in the background,

126
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,760
filling up the SSD on my laptop, and then once that transfer is complete, would then

127
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,000
launch VLC.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,400
Now it can pass along the SMB path right to VLC, VLC is SMB aware, also FTP, SFTP, and

129
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
others.

130
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,440
It'll fire the file right up, no transfer required, streams it over the network.

131
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Hallelujah.

132
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,240
So you're telling me that video LAN player can now play videos over the LAN?

133
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,240
Yeah, yeah.

134
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,720
VLC also now uses OpenGL and Linux for smooth 4K playback.

135
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,760
That's another problem I've had trying to play my drone footage on Linux.

136
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,760
These are two huge features for Chris personally.

137
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,280
Yeah, and hardware decoding by default for 8K playback as well.

138
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,480
And supporting 10-bit HDR and 3D video, they've really upped the game with this release.

139
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,880
This is also an LTS release, so that's interesting.

140
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,240
And this version of VLC now supports adaptive streaming, also known as Dash, which could

141
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,000
make pulling in live streams in VLC a lot smoother of experience with less buffer, less

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
delay.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,520
You know, I've pretty much switched over to GNOME MPV player, but this is tempting me

144
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,600
back now.

145
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,080
This is sounding really good, this release of VLC.

146
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,420
I've been really enjoying Dragon Player on the Plasma desktop, but I will admit I snap

147
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,440
installed VLC because that was the fastest way I could get version 3.0.

148
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,840
And I've been using it all morning, and I'm really liking the new features.

149
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:45,280
It's funny, I find myself installing things that way myself now.

150
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,600
That's the first port of call that's checked, is there a snap available, because you know

151
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,680
it's pretty much going to be the latest version.

152
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,360
And also, it's got the advantage that you can have different versions installed at the

153
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
same time.

154
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Yeah, exactly.

155
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,360
I did an AB of version 2.2 or whatever it is and 3.0, 3.0 via the snap and the standard

156
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,600
version that we've all had now for a while via the distros repo, and was able to verify

157
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,740
that yeah, version 3.0 can do the Samba playback.

158
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,020
These things do work better.

159
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,020
It's kind of great.

160
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,200
Now, I also have both of them installed, and they're not really differentiated in my launcher,

161
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,440
but I can navigate that.

162
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
It was intentional.

163
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,920
Yeah, and something I would definitely install with a snap is Nextcloud 13.

164
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,740
Yeah, version 13 final.

165
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,060
We talked about the beta weeks ago, specifically around the video and text chat, but now it's

166
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:35,000
shipped in version 13 as well as a new improved UI, end-to-end encryption, improved performance,

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,040
and specifically a focus on improved communication with LDAP.

168
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,080
Yeah, there's a lot of good features on paper, but I still don't find myself using it.

169
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
I don't know why.

170
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:50,360
I just feel that even after 13 versions now, it still can't compete with the likes of Google

171
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Drive really.

172
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,840
You know, Joe, there's a quote from Frank in the release notes here, Frank who runs

173
00:09:54,840 --> 00:10:00,440
Nextcloud, and it kind of helps frame the project's goals for me.

174
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,080
He says, our forward-looking development strategy is the reason behind our meteoric rise in

175
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
the market.

176
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,480
With a laser-sharp focus on enabling modern employees to be productive while keeping IT

177
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,300
in control over the data they've worked on, Nextcloud will continue to push the boundaries

178
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,400
of what a secure, self-hosted file exchange and collaboration platform offers.

179
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,000
There's a couple of key points that I take away from that.

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,880
Number one key point is Nextcloud's primary feature is you own the data.

181
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,980
It's on-premises.

182
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,400
You have complete control over it.

183
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,080
That's feature number one.

184
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,400
Feature number two is they're moving this platform forward at a breakneck pace, adding

185
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,960
features that you would otherwise have to pay for from much larger commercial platforms.

186
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,980
And if you only need components of them, they're trying to get them built into Nextcloud as

187
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,820
fast as possible.

188
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:52,400
What I don't hear in there are terms like platform stability or long-term stability

189
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
goals.

190
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,400
It's just not where they're at yet.

191
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,480
Right now, they're in the grow and add feature phase.

192
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
Yeah.

193
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,960
I mean, the first point is great and being on-premises, being in complete control of

194
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,240
your data, that is what we all want.

195
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,560
But as you say, there's not any stability there and okay, maybe they're going to work

196
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
towards that.

197
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:17,400
But until they have that, I just can't see myself deploying it in production anywhere.

198
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,880
It's just testing for me at this stage.

199
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:25,560
I feel that even here we are 13 versions in, it's still something that I'm testing and

200
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,080
evaluating and I'm not comfortable putting into production.

201
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:33,080
I mean, I could just about run it myself, but I definitely wouldn't put it into production

202
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,360
for other people because I just don't think it's ready yet.

203
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,720
Which is a real shame because it's probably the best we have.

204
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,800
I know that Noah likes C file, doesn't he?

205
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,480
Which I've tried and that's good and we've got PDO as well, but they don't offer the

206
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,800
same feature set as Nextcloud.

207
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,300
But maybe they're just too many features in Nextcloud and they should concentrate more

208
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,120
on the core functionality and get that 100% rock solid before they start doing things

209
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,960
like this video calling and all of that stuff.

210
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,680
Well, I would flip it around for consideration and say that perhaps the core core functionality

211
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:11,480
is not file sync, but collaboration, calendars, contacts, that sort of stuff, notes, photos,

212
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,160
documents, that support syncing that stuff to your local file system.

213
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,720
So it's sort of a reverse of I think what it is, it's just they're not in alignment

214
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,480
with what your priorities are.

215
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,600
Well you could certainly spin it that way, yeah, okay, let's give them the benefit of

216
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
the doubt.

217
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Yeah, no, I got to try.

218
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,600
I mean, I'm not saying that they're right or wrong because your requirements are very

219
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,160
similar to my requirements and my sentiments are similar to yours, 13 versions in.

220
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,680
I'm still testing it, I run it on a droplet, but I don't actually use it as my primary

221
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
sync system either.

222
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,680
In fact, when we're done recording the show, we won't be using the Nextcloud system I have

223
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,200
running on a droplet.

224
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,840
We'll be using a commercial platform to transfer the file, simply because you and I have just

225
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,880
had better experiences.

226
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,920
Well something I had a good experience with today when I tried it out was the new release

227
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
of Android x86.

228
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:08,760
I say new, it's 7.1 Nougat rather than 8 point whatever Oreo, so it's a little bit behind

229
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,760
the times.

230
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,720
Yeah, it came out in October of 2016, that is a little more than kind of.

231
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,040
Yeah, yeah, but it is good.

232
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,320
They've got this new launcher, so when you first boot it up, you've got a choice of launchers,

233
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:29,200
the traditional one and one called Taskbar, which as the name suggests, is more of a traditional

234
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,880
desktop with windowed applications.

235
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,720
And it's not 100% yet because if you maximize a window, there's no way to get it unmaximized.

236
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,240
So there's work to do there, but it does feel pretty cool.

237
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:52,040
They've kind of taken some of the features from Remix OS, which is no longer available,

238
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,600
and they've made something that's suitable for touchscreen devices or for a device that's

239
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,780
using a mouse, but there's that big thing hanging over it.

240
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:06,680
This is a very old version of Android, it's taken them over a year, well 18 months nearly,

241
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,240
to get this version of Android to a stable release.

242
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,680
And that doesn't look good for the project, does it?

243
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,680
I'd like to hear more about your thoughts having tried it, because I did not get a chance

244
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:21,360
to run it, but my response to that would be it's really about the Play API, isn't it?

245
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,800
And Nougat is definitely in that range of very well supported from an application standpoint.

246
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:33,880
Well that's true, and most people are on some sort of 7.x version of Android, and there

247
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,780
are very few people who are actually using 8.

248
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:42,640
It's only really people with the newest flagship devices that most of the world are stuck using

249
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,680
7.x or even earlier.

250
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:51,000
Very true, and what reduces the sting a little bit is they've managed to stick kernel 4.98

251
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,080
under the hood, so it's a little bit newer of a kernel, at least as far as Android goes.

252
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:00,960
Well yeah, compared to most phones, that is a very, very brand new kernel, isn't it?

253
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,480
Most devices are on sort of 2 and 3 kernels.

254
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:10,200
Now this is noteworthy because this is a pretty complete effort to move Android over to x86,

255
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,760
and the Android x86 project has been around for a while, has a pretty big legacy, and

256
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,960
they've built in support for things like supporting EFI boot, working to partition your drive.

257
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,960
I mean it's a complete experience here, and so I think it's definitely worth trying if

258
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,200
you're curious at all about what this would be like.

259
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:32,000
I do know that there is a community project out there that is based around Oreo, so version

260
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,800
8 of Android, and you can find that in the XDA forums.

261
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
It's called Bliss86.

262
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,640
I'll put a link in the show notes too.

263
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,520
Now that's Oreo based, so it's newer, but it's not the official Android x86 project.

264
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,640
It's a community project.

265
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,960
It brings a bunch of different things together, but it'll be in the links if you want to try

266
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,960
it.

267
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,960
Yeah, and where this really feels at home, Android x86, is on my little Vivo book that

268
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,240
I've talked about before with Plasma Mobile.

269
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,120
It's a laptop with a touchscreen, so it's kind of the best of both worlds, and it really

270
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,920
makes me pine back for the days when I had a QWERTY slider phone and had an actual hardware

271
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
keyboard.

272
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,240
I feel so much better with a keyboard, but I don't think I'll be ever getting one of

273
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,360
those again.

274
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,240
So just to be clear, this version has the Google apps?

275
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,240
Is Chrome installed?

276
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
Is the Play Store installed?

277
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,400
Yeah, you've got Chrome in the Play Store, which is a bit surprising to me.

278
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,080
I don't know how they get away with distributing it.

279
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
Maybe they just don't really care.

280
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
I don't know.

281
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:30,520
But yeah, it's fully functional with all the proprietary goodness in it, which I suppose

282
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,020
some of the audience won't be into, but the pragmatists out there will be.

283
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,160
It's just ready to go.

284
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,840
You can install whatever apps you want and just start using it.

285
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,840
It's available as an ISO.

286
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,920
I mean, if nothing else, you could chuck it in a virtual machine.

287
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,440
I'm going to give it a go after the show.

288
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
Yeah, do it.

289
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,760
I mean, if you've got a touchscreen device, try and boot it up on that, because you very

290
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,680
quickly realize that Android is not designed for a mouse.

291
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,200
Although with this new launcher, it's a little bit more mouse friendly, but I think that

292
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:04,600
ultimately there's a lot of gestures and stuff in Android that need a touchscreen, really.

293
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,640
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

294
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,440
It's a whole suite, a platform, if you will, of advanced training tools to increase your

295
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,920
skills with, around, and all about Linux.

296
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,960
It's everything you need to learn and get a hands-on experience, specifically hands-on.

297
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,760
This is the stuff that really works for me.

298
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,120
They spin up cloud servers as you need them.

299
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,800
They're included with your Linux Academy membership at no additional cost, so you could go mess

300
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,200
around in the lab if you want just for fun.

301
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,720
There's no metered usage.

302
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,000
There's no hidden fees.

303
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,280
It just serves whatever you want to work on, and what's great about it is when you sign

304
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,440
up with Linux Academy and you start doing some courseware, you pick which distribution

305
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,440
you want to learn on.

306
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
I think that's great, too.

307
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,720
Think about the amount of work that goes into supporting six-plus Linux distributions that

308
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,280
you get to choose from, but the great thing is they tied it in with the virtual machine,

309
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,400
so when you select the distribution courseware, it matches that in the VM, spins up the lab,

310
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,960
and now you can SSH into that same.

311
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,160
Debian matches.

312
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,320
Red Hat matches.

313
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,320
That's brilliant.

314
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,120
That's something that a company full of Linux users would think of and the competition can't

315
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,080
even conceive of, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

316
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,360
Go there to try out those hands-on labs.

317
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,720
Try out the self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux and cloud and DevOps topic,

318
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,440
from core Linux fundamentals to OpenStack and Azure and Google's cloud platform, and

319
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:29,360
of course, AWS, and they have practice exams to help you get ready for quizzes, and they

320
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,600

326
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:58,920
Okay, let's talk about elementary OS and anyone who's been anywhere near our Linux over the

327
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,200
last week has seen the storm, shall we say, that this caused.

328
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:12,600
So Daniel Foray, the great leader of elementary OS, posted a blog post on Medium that explained

329
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:19,240
that although the app center is growing and making a little bit of pocket change, it's

330
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,720
not doing brilliantly, and so they've thought long and hard about it and come up with a

331
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:30,160
great solution, and that is that paid apps that you haven't paid anything for will not

332
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,840
automatically update unless you put in how much you want to pay for them, and that can

333
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,480
still be zero, but every time you get feature updates, that is going to be the case that

334
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,400
you're going to have to keep putting in zero.

335
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,600
Security features and OS upgrades are exempt from this, and they will auto-update if you

336
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,440
want them to, and this is divisive to say the least.

337
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,720
So to back up a bit, you mentioned they released some details.

338
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,240
I really respect that they did this because this gives us real data to work with here,

339
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,680
and I think it puts the entire thing in perspective.

340
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,500
So they released their app center in May of 2017.

341
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:14,760
It's got a lot of coverage and a lot of press, and they've sold, in that time, about $1,700

342
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,760
worth of software.

343
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,320
Well, $1,700 a day is not too bad, is it?

344
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,120
Oh no, hang on, $1,700 in the entire time.

345
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,440
Yeah, exactly.

346
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,600
Yeah, that's a little rough.

347
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:35,400
I think the average selling price was $2.30 for an app, and only about 1% of their users

348
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,880
were paying.

349
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,000
Now they did a poll, and they talked to their user base, and there was a bunch of different

350
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
reasons.

351
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You don't offer a trial.

352
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,840
I want to try the app before I buy.

353
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,200
A lot of times I buy the app, and then I forget to pay for it, and there's no way for me to

354
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,800
go back and see what apps I haven't paid for.

355
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,880
I think there's probably a few other reasons they're not talking about either.

356
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,000
You don't have your purchases sync across your elementary OS installs, which would de-incentivize

357
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,280
me a little bit, and it would incentivize me to pay a lot more if I knew I could pay

358
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,840
once and it would count for all of my machines.

359
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,800
I might pay more like $15 instead of $5.

360
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,920
But since the entire system is around the humble bundle pay-for-what-you-want-to-use

361
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,720
amount, I don't really feel like it's unreasonable on subsequent updates to say, hey, would you

362
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,200
like to pay for this now?

363
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,800
You're updating it still.

364
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,340
You're still obviously using it.

365
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,340
Would you like to pay for it now?

366
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,720
Do you consider it valuable?

367
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,480
Because that's just a kind of reminder, oh, yeah, I'm still using that great Markdown

368
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,480
editor.

369
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,840
I probably should kick that developer a couple of bucks.

370
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,820
Yeah, I don't have a problem with it.

371
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:42,360
As long as you can enter zero, then there's no problem as far as I'm concerned, but I

372
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,240
can see why it would annoy people.

373
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:52,000
But as Dan says in this post, you're talking about a complete paradigm shift in how people

374
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
expect to get free and open source software.

375
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,720
People expect it to be free as in beer.

376
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,240
And he says that previously the standard was zero and now we're talking about a non-zero

377
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,240
number.

378
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,720
It might not be very much of $2.30 per purchase and only 1% of people, as he said, but at

379
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,240
least they are pushing forward in this new direction.

380
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,320
And you kind of have to hand it to them.

381
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,240
When I spoke to Dan on Late Night Linux, I asked him a lot of questions upfront about

382
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,520
money and some people said that it was kind of a bit too financially heavy.

383
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:31,000
But for me, the reason I did that was elementary stands out as a distro that really is not

384
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,640
afraid to make some money and not afraid to say this is a lot of work and we're doing

385
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,880
this full time and we need to monetize this.

386
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,920
And I think that you have to take your hat off to them, that they are, as far as I know,

387
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,280
unique in the smaller distros at least.

388
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,480
I mean, you've got Red Hat who just blatantly charge for support and all the rest of it.

389
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,960
But in terms of the so-called boutique distros, most of them have a Patreon and will accept

390
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,180
donations and everything, but they don't put it upfront like elementary do and fair play.

391
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,680
And to be clear, all of the open source free software that's being seeded from the Ubuntu

392
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,560
repos and being shipped on elementary OS, that's all going to still get updated for

393
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
free.

394
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,920
The free updates, those things still get updated for free.

395
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,000
They're not monetizing like Vim.

396
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,840
They're monetizing applications that developers have handwritten for the elementary OS desktop

397
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,280
and chosen to submit them to the elementary app center with the intention of attempting

398
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,060
to monetize them.

399
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,800
Those are the only apps that are being held for updates.

400
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,520
Yeah, and these apps also adhere to fairly stringent guidelines, don't they, in terms

401
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,380
of how they're put together so that they'll work well within elementary.

402
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,380
So they're putting this out there.

403
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,800
They're taking feedback right now, and it's going to eventually ship in the next version

404
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,480
of elementary OS, which will be Juno.

405
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,800
You say eventually.

406
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,400
That's probably going to be mid to late April, maybe May.

407
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,880
And the way time goes these days, man, that feels like about two hours away.

408
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,880
That's true.

409
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
That's true.

410
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,840
And we actually have a bit of news for Juno while we're on the topic.

411
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,800
There's going to be a big version jump.

412
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:14,520
It's not openSUSE a jump to 42 big, but they will be going from version 0.5, essentially

413
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,880
what they would have been, 0.5, to a 5.0.

414
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,880
And like everything that elementary OS does, it seems to be already generating quite a

415
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,880
bit of feedback.

416
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,560
Well, yeah, they're setting their stall out, aren't they?

417
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,200
They're essentially saying, we're no longer a beta.

418
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
We're going to be 5.0.

419
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,560
We're a proper release.

420
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,480
It's a proper operating system.

421
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,440
Pay us some money to use it, please, or not, if you don't want to.

422
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,360
Yeah, rumor has it there's going to be a blog post out Monday or Tuesday.

423
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,400
It pretty much lays out the reason for this.

424
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:49,920
And it does a really good job of demonstrating the remarkable progress from version 0.1 Jupiter,

425
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,400
which was really rough, to version 5.0.

426
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,000
And it's understandable.

427
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,740
And they're kind of saying a statement now.

428
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,740
It's a platform.

429
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,740
It's an app center.

430
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,660
It's a user community.

431
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,140
It's a design ethos.

432
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,960
It's much more than a 1.0 at this point.

433
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,220
And so they're going the full 5.0.

434
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,760
They're going full 5.0, Joe.

435
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Yeah.

436
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,160
Well, again, fair play to them.

437
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,800
It's not a distro that I am personally using.

438
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,680
But I can see its appeal.

439
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:24,240
And it has an appeal to people who are coming from proprietary platforms who expect a certain

440
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,520
polish.

441
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,460
And I like to see that.

442
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,640
It's good that we have that in our ecosystem.

443
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,160
But in the meantime, I'm sticking with Ubuntu, I'm afraid.

444
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,720
Oh, I'm shocked by that.

445
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,920
I'm absolutely shocked.

446
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,780
Of course, now you'll have plenty of time to implement Mozilla's new project, Project

447
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,780
Things.

448
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,780
Yeah.

449
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,780
So this has been a long time coming.

450
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,920
But now it's kind of officially announced.

451
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:51,900
And it's their Internet of Things platform, where they are attempting to standardize the

452
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,440
way all these Internet of Things things talk to each other.

453
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:01,200
But the thing is, do we really need another standard way to do that at this point?

454
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,520
Because we've got quite a few already, haven't we?

455
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
Yeah.

456
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,400
So you started with Home Assistant, and of course, I've interviewed the folks behind

457
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,360
Edge X Foundry, which is now part of the Linux Foundation.

458
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,000
Those are two very different marketplaces.

459
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,400
One's for home and one's for the enterprise.

460
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:21,160
And then you bring in Project Things, which feels like it's more enterprise focused, except

461
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,960
for they're really specifically focused on supporting the Raspberry Pi.

462
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
Yeah.

463
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,360
And they talk about mapping out your home as well.

464
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,240
So I think it's aimed for now, at least, at home users.

465
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,080
But maybe they've got an eye on the enterprise down the line.

466
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,680
Well, I think this is part of a larger strategy by Mozilla.

467
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,980
This brings in Voice Control, which is using Project Common Voice.

468
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,460
It's taking advantage of the initiatives that they've set up at iot.mozilla.org, where they've

469
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:49,640
been working on a Web Things API that they're trying to get a W3 standard based around.

470
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,680
And they've also created a Things REST API and a Things WebSocket API, and they're trying

471
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:59,920
to create an industry standard as part of the web standards body that they would be,

472
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,840
of course, one of the premier platforms for.

473
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,960
And all of that said, this does actually seem like one of Mozilla's power areas.

474
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,960
This probably should be one of the things they're focusing on and one of the things

475
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,960
that we could use an organization like Mozilla applying a little influence over.

476
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,800
Well, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

477
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,180
They've got a lot of fingers in a lot of pies, and they've got a lot of money sloshing around

478
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,720
to pay for it all.

479
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,440
And as I always say, I'd rather an organization like Mozilla was spearheading this stuff,

480
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,760
because if you're going to trust anyone, Mozilla seems trustworthy enough to me.

481
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,680
Well, Joe, while you're out there buying your smart plugs and testing out Mozilla's Project

482
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,240
Things, I'm going to save my pennies for a Nintendo Switch now that it looks like I'll

483
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,360
be installing Linux on it soon.

484
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,080
Yeah, remember Runs Linux as a segment?

485
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,160
Well, this is a throwback to that.

486
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:51,120
A hacker group has managed to get Linux running on the Switch, Fail Overflow they're called.

487
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,280
It looks like it's just kind of command line stuff, and it's basically a proof of concept

488
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:03,040
at this point, and it's really just a flaw in the boot ROM that allows you to run Linux

489
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:09,040
realistically just to get pirate games running on it, or at least homebrew stuff, that sort

490
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,040
of thing.

491
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Oh, Joe, where's the trust?

492
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,080
Where's the trust, Joe?

493
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,680
Well, yeah, but you're not going to be running a GNOME desktop or anything on it, are you?

494
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,860
No, that's not the point, but it will push me over the edge.

495
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,760
This is one of the most wanted devices that I haven't really just gotten a chance to pull

496
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,120
the trigger on.

497
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:31,060
And I gotta say, what I love about this is it's taking advantage of a flaw in the system

498
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:37,060
on a chip, in the Tegra X1, that executes before any Nintendo code ever starts.

499
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,840
So they can't remotely fix this thing.

500
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,620
Probably best case, and the Failover developers are speculating this as well, best case, Nintendo

501
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:51,000
could issue a new version of the Switch at some point, which ships with a patched version

502
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,080
of the system on a chip from NVIDIA, but all of the existing Switches would still be vulnerable.

503
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:01,960
Yeah, I can imagine an angry phone call from Nintendo to NVIDIA this week.

504
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,960
What's going on?

505
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,480
Sort this out.

506
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,080
If Nintendo knew it was good for them, they'd leave it in there, because it's just going

507
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,600
to sell this to a bunch of Linux nerds that were already on the fence.

508
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,000
If I can get my games on there digitally, and I don't have to deal with this horrible

509
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,040
Nintendo online e-store thing that they have, and I don't have to deal with cartridges,

510
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
I'm all about it.

511
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,660
We've got three kids, and this is the only way this kind of stuff works for us.

512
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,660
This pushes me over the edge.

513
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,280
The fact that I could put Linux on there, back up our stuff.

514
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:35,520
I'm not even looking to pirate, I just don't want to have my kids dealing with any of that

515
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,520
stuff.

516
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,440
Yeah, but most people will be looking to pirate, and that's where they make their money.

517
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,960
They don't really make the money on the hardware these days, do they?

518
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,280
It's all on the games and the content that they're selling you after the fact.

519
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,680
So I can see why they'd want to crack down on it very quickly if they can.

520
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,880
Also, it's going to make a killer codey box.

521
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,760
Yeah, if you can get it to that point, which we're not there yet, but it probably won't

522
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
be long, will it?

523
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,840
Nope, we've just got to get Wayland working on that thing and everything else will fall

524
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,840
into place.

525
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
Maybe a little Plasma Mobile.

526
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,880
And if that ever happens, we'll let you know.
