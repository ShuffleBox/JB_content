00:00.000 --> 00:08.960
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 125, recorded on September 29th, 2019.

00:08.960 --> 00:09.960
I'm Chris.

00:09.960 --> 00:10.960
And I'm Joe.

00:10.960 --> 00:11.960
Hello, Joe.

00:11.960 --> 00:12.960
Good to be connected with you.

00:12.960 --> 00:17.240
And we kick the show off this week with some big news from the CentOS project.

00:17.240 --> 00:21.680
Yes, CentOS 8 has been released exactly as we thought it would be this week.

00:21.680 --> 00:25.960
But also CentOS Stream has been released, something we weren't expecting.

00:25.960 --> 00:30.440
Looking back at the reports of a delay, you wonder if maybe this was part of the eight

00:30.440 --> 00:32.000
release delay.

00:32.000 --> 00:39.400
CentOS Stream will or now is a rolling release distro that exists as midstream between the

00:39.400 --> 00:45.300
upstream development in Fedora Linux and downstream development in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

00:45.300 --> 00:48.460
So it's kind of in between the two, which is a perfect spot.

00:48.460 --> 00:52.480
There was kind of a hole here before things would happen in Fedora, it would get in good

00:52.480 --> 00:57.920
shape, then the Red Hat Enterprise team would come in, they'd grab that, and they'd start

00:57.920 --> 00:58.920
working on that.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.420
And then they'd eventually release a Red Hat Enterprise Linux based on that.

01:01.420 --> 01:04.840
But there was really no between, nothing back and forth.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.400
This sits right in that middle spot now.

01:07.400 --> 01:11.080
It's not an upstream, it's not a downstream, it's a midstream distro.

01:11.080 --> 01:15.520
This is going to be a really useful distro for developers who are targeting RHEL, because

01:15.520 --> 01:19.640
the updates that you're going to get in CentOS Stream reflect the updates that you're going

01:19.640 --> 01:22.440
to get in the minor release versions of RHEL.

01:22.440 --> 01:28.120
So what you get now in CentOS Stream will eventually become Red Hat Enterprise Linux

01:28.120 --> 01:29.840
8.1.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.480
That's kind of how this works.

01:31.480 --> 01:36.840
I like that, because Fedora moves really fast, and I love it on my desktop, but it moves

01:36.840 --> 01:40.800
a little too fast for me to use it properly on a server.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.760
And RHEL, well that moves a little too slow.

01:43.760 --> 01:48.840
And so CentOS sits right there in the middle, where it could sort of be that perfect amount

01:48.840 --> 01:53.320
of movement, where things stay fresh, you get nice new packages, you kind of see where

01:53.320 --> 01:58.200
RHEL's going, but it's not limited to nine months-ish of support.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.360
You get many years of support.

02:00.360 --> 02:04.520
That sounds ideal to me, and I've always kind of been a fan of the semi-rolling or fully

02:04.520 --> 02:09.400
rolling model, and this just brings it in a sort of consumable way to the server.

02:09.400 --> 02:13.240
Of course you will still have regular CentOS 8 and the various updates to that, which I

02:13.240 --> 02:18.920
think will probably be more popular on servers, because a rolling release...

02:18.920 --> 02:21.720
Yeah, it's good for Chris, but it's not necessarily good for everybody.

02:21.720 --> 02:26.720
Yeah, I think if you're running it on one server that's not critical, then maybe it'd

02:26.720 --> 02:27.720
be good, but...

02:27.720 --> 02:30.880
Well, I mean, you're mad enough to use Fedora on a server, so what does that tell you?

02:30.880 --> 02:31.880
That's right, man.

02:31.880 --> 02:36.440
Hey, back in the bad old days, I was using Gentoo, so don't listen to me at all on this

02:36.440 --> 02:37.440
topic.

02:37.440 --> 02:42.040
But I think it's pretty neat too, because from not just a developer's perspective on

02:42.040 --> 02:47.080
what's coming to RHEL, but also from a contribute back to one of the more significant Linux

02:47.080 --> 02:52.320
distributions directly, by contributing back to CentOS Stream, those fixes and patches

02:52.320 --> 02:56.600
will make it into RHEL in a more direct way than it does currently with Fedora.

02:56.600 --> 03:01.120
Some stuff from Fedora makes it, but not everything, and that's fascinating.

03:01.120 --> 03:04.280
Didn't see this one coming, and now I'm just left with a few questions.

03:04.280 --> 03:09.600
How will the CentOS project handle maintaining both the traditional CentOS and the Stream

03:09.600 --> 03:10.600
version?

03:10.600 --> 03:13.200
Will it fit right into their workflow, or perhaps it's a burden?

03:13.200 --> 03:15.080
We'll just kind of have to wait and see.

03:15.080 --> 03:19.860
And then additionally, I think another question we have is, what as an end user should I expect

03:19.860 --> 03:23.680
in terms of package update frequency?

03:23.680 --> 03:28.640
Every day I'm going to have 30 packages, or about 30 packages a month?

03:28.640 --> 03:32.680
And those are just questions we won't know until we try it some more, which we both did

03:32.680 --> 03:33.680
for the show here.

03:33.680 --> 03:38.760
Yeah, I tried both versions, CentOS 8 and CentOS 8 Stream, and I went for the workstation

03:38.760 --> 03:41.680
installation, and it was a bit rough to be honest.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.680
Both of them were.

03:42.680 --> 03:46.640
I think CentOS 8 was less rough, but there was a clear difference between them.

03:46.640 --> 03:51.480
Just simple things like going to GNOME software, I got errors straight away, which was weird,

03:51.480 --> 03:55.360
like about some extensions that were 404-ing or something.

03:55.360 --> 04:00.840
And in Stream, there was no GIMP, which was a bit weird, but then there was in the regular

04:00.840 --> 04:01.840
CentOS.

04:01.840 --> 04:06.880
I didn't spend a great deal of time with it, but CentOS is not really a desktop distro

04:06.880 --> 04:11.520
is it, and that was made pretty clear to me when I tried it out.

04:11.520 --> 04:12.760
Yeah, I suppose not.

04:12.760 --> 04:18.840
Although you'll wonder if Stream could end up making a decent base for a workstation,

04:18.840 --> 04:20.820
much like Ubuntu LTS does.

04:20.820 --> 04:24.160
So it's worth checking out, but no, I tried it out on the server myself.

04:24.160 --> 04:29.560
I wanted to see what it was like to try to go from 7 to 8, which I haven't figured out

04:29.560 --> 04:31.000
yet, I have to be honest.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.480
But I'm not very familiar, this is the only CentOS box I have, so I just haven't done

04:34.480 --> 04:35.480
it before.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.040
This is my first one.

04:37.040 --> 04:42.440
And then I tried it out on Lin-Note as well, which has a one-click deployment image already

04:42.440 --> 04:43.480
of it.

04:43.480 --> 04:47.400
Once you get it set up, if you've used Fedora in the last few releases, you're right at

04:47.400 --> 04:48.400
home.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.360
You've got DNF by default installed, ready to go now.

04:51.360 --> 04:55.360
Even the desktop graphic stack is more in line with what you get in Fedora, Wayland

04:55.360 --> 05:01.080
is available, and it comes with cockpit pre-installed, they refer to it more as like a, I think they

05:01.080 --> 05:03.440
just call it the web interface, but it's cockpit.

05:03.440 --> 05:09.960
And so you get a great web UI that is safe and pretty capable to manage the box if you'd

05:09.960 --> 05:10.960
like.

05:10.960 --> 05:15.360
And this is the first version of CentOS that ships with Podman, which replaces Docker,

05:15.360 --> 05:17.280
and of course Docker is available as well.

05:17.280 --> 05:21.280
I think it's the best release of RHEL ever, and so by that extension it's the best release

05:21.280 --> 05:22.640
of CentOS ever.

05:22.640 --> 05:28.240
I've never in my life been hyped about a CentOS release or a RHEL release, but I just think

05:28.240 --> 05:34.520
as we round out 2019, we're in a position where we have really good long-term support

05:34.520 --> 05:35.520
distributions.

05:35.520 --> 05:39.560
Ubuntu LTS 1804 is in a really good spot right now.

05:39.560 --> 05:45.080
It's gone through some release cycles, it is really solid on my production systems,

05:45.080 --> 05:51.180
and CentOS 8 looks like it's a great release, and it's also supported for many years.

05:51.180 --> 05:53.200
We have a spoil of choices right now, Joe.

05:53.200 --> 05:57.360
Yeah, just when we get to the point where the underlying OS doesn't really matter anymore,

05:57.360 --> 05:58.360
we spoil for choice.

05:58.360 --> 06:01.220
That is a bit ironic.

06:01.220 --> 06:07.020
One last note, we'll have a link in the show notes over to a post by Matthew Miller about

06:07.020 --> 06:11.240
where Fedora and CentOS fit together, and he paints a pretty good picture.

06:11.240 --> 06:15.160
He said, sometime after the previous RHEL release, Red Hat would then suddenly turn

06:15.160 --> 06:17.280
more attention to Fedora than usual.

06:17.280 --> 06:22.160
A few months later, Red Hat would split off a new RHEL version developed internally.

06:22.160 --> 06:25.020
And then after some months, that'd be put into the world, including all of the source

06:25.020 --> 06:27.560
from which then CentOS is built.

06:27.560 --> 06:31.920
That source drop would continue for updates, and sometimes those would include patches

06:31.920 --> 06:36.880
that were in Fedora, but there was never any real visible connection, and each step had

06:36.880 --> 06:37.880
problems.

06:37.880 --> 06:44.000
Intermittent attention, closed-door development, blind code drops, not quite enough ongoing

06:44.000 --> 06:48.600
transparency, but now with this shift, it's really opening all of that up.

06:48.600 --> 06:54.680
Fedora is the top upstream, it flows through CentOS stream, which makes it into RHEL, which

06:54.680 --> 07:00.720
opens up a whole layer of visibility we never saw before, and really, I think, safely positions

07:00.720 --> 07:05.840
each project logically, where you could see they would stick around and survive in the

07:05.840 --> 07:08.840
future IBM structure, IBM Red Hat structure.

07:08.840 --> 07:11.680
There's a clear value position for each of those.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.080
Yeah, I think that's true.

07:13.080 --> 07:18.520
And it makes me wonder, are we going to see Fedora taking more risks and trying more new

07:18.520 --> 07:21.880
stuff and kind of going out on a limb a little bit more?

07:21.880 --> 07:24.080
Because you've got that CentOS buffer now.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.080
Exactly.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.360
So I think this could potentially be very good news.

07:27.360 --> 07:31.680
Not so good news, though, for Docker, ironically, since a lot of the workloads these systems

07:31.680 --> 07:34.440
are doing now involves containers.

07:34.440 --> 07:38.860
Once valued at over a billion dollars, Docker has now told their employees they're having

07:38.860 --> 07:40.360
significant challenges.

07:40.360 --> 07:45.800
Yeah, an internal email has leaked from the CEO Rob Bearden, which says that they're looking

07:45.800 --> 07:50.800
to get some more funding and kind of hold tight while we do it.

07:50.800 --> 07:55.400
It does not paint a very good picture at all of how Docker is doing financially.

07:55.400 --> 07:58.320
But is this a real surprise?

07:58.320 --> 07:59.560
Not really, is it?

07:59.560 --> 08:05.560
Because Docker, although the technology is amazing and used by tons of people across

08:05.560 --> 08:09.080
the industry, they don't really have that much of a business model.

08:09.080 --> 08:13.520
Yeah, the company attempts to sell a range of products to help businesses manage their

08:13.520 --> 08:15.680
deployments of multiple containers.

08:15.680 --> 08:20.080
But the revenue hasn't really taken off in a way that matches the funding and the requirements.

08:20.080 --> 08:24.040
It appears, according to these emails, which will have a story linked in the show notes,

08:24.040 --> 08:29.680
that this has been an ongoing internal discussion about their struggle.

08:29.680 --> 08:35.160
And he writes, quote, thank you for persevering in spite of the lack of clarity we've had

08:35.160 --> 08:36.960
these past few weeks.

08:36.960 --> 08:40.360
That doesn't sound like a very pleasant environment to work in.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.800
And here's something else to consider.

08:42.800 --> 08:50.640
Martin joined in May, he became the fourth CEO, and just their third since 2017.

08:50.640 --> 08:54.400
They're really trying to get some traction here and they're struggling.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.940
They have around 500 employees on the books, they're based out of San Francisco, and they've

08:58.940 --> 09:03.080
raised more than $200 million in funding.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.440
And they're looking at going another round.

09:04.440 --> 09:09.740
But it's a really tricky thing because their core product is baked into the operating system.

09:09.740 --> 09:16.800
And like I just talked about, RHEL 8 is shipping Podman, which allows you to manage containers,

09:16.800 --> 09:21.760
some would argue in a more secure way, that doesn't involve Docker.

09:21.760 --> 09:27.660
And Canonical uses LexD, there's SystemD containers, there's several competing technologies that

09:27.660 --> 09:33.360
are baked into platforms that then have their own management tools on top of them.

09:33.360 --> 09:38.640
Or there's things like Kubernetes, which truly essentially make Docker just an implementation

09:38.640 --> 09:39.640
detail.

09:39.640 --> 09:43.880
I hope that they can sort themselves out because it would be a shame for them to go bust and

09:43.880 --> 09:44.880
go away.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.920
But somehow I'm not hopeful.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.480
I completely agree.

09:48.480 --> 09:52.180
It seems like there should be something there and they've done some good in this space.

09:52.180 --> 09:55.280
They deserve to find a way to make a living.

09:55.280 --> 10:00.080
I hope the Gnome Foundation gets some good news because they're currently facing a lawsuit

10:00.080 --> 10:03.720
from the Rothschild Patent Imaging LLC.

10:03.720 --> 10:08.120
There's a brief post about this on Gnome.org, where they quote Neil McGovern, the executive

10:08.120 --> 10:12.880
director of the Gnome Foundation, and he says, we've retained legal counsel and intend to

10:12.880 --> 10:15.720
vigorously defend against this baseless suit.

10:15.720 --> 10:20.880
But he also says, due to ongoing litigation, we unfortunately cannot make any further comments

10:20.880 --> 10:23.700
at this time, which is understandable, really.

10:23.700 --> 10:26.960
But this is just a straight up patent troll going after Shotwell.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.160
Yeah, and you are right, it is a patent troll.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.360
It's literally what they do.

10:30.360 --> 10:37.640
In fact, back in 2017, they sued a barbecue restaurant, as well as 15 other small franchises

10:37.640 --> 10:41.400
and restaurants and family owned businesses for using QR codes.

10:41.400 --> 10:47.040
And the real icing on the cake, of course, is the patent troll has enjoyed doing their

10:47.040 --> 10:53.200
work out of the Eastern District of Texas, where that federal court has been a hotspot

10:53.200 --> 10:57.800
for these types of patent suits and generally been one the patent trolls prefer to go to.

10:57.800 --> 11:03.320
It's classic patent troll material, stuff that we used to be commonly seen years ago.

11:03.320 --> 11:04.720
They're playing one of the greatest hits.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.840
Yeah, and once again, this highlights the absurdity of software patents in the first

11:08.840 --> 11:09.840
place.

11:09.840 --> 11:10.840
Yeah.

11:10.840 --> 11:14.240
And in this case, it seems to come down to how Shotwell can intelligently transfer images

11:14.240 --> 11:18.580
over Wi Fi, at least according to the initial research I did into this patent complaint.

11:18.580 --> 11:22.440
It's not something particularly unique to Shotwell.

11:22.440 --> 11:24.580
But they're willing, again, to go after barbecue restaurants.

11:24.580 --> 11:27.500
So they're gonna go after the Dome Foundation.

11:27.500 --> 11:31.360
By the way, we'll have a link in the show notes if you would like to donate to Dome.

11:31.360 --> 11:35.960
They offer things from PayPal, bank transfer, a check or even Bitcoin, any amount would

11:35.960 --> 11:36.960
probably help right now.

11:36.960 --> 11:40.520
We'll have that link at linuxactionnews.com slash one to five.

11:40.520 --> 11:43.520
Yeah, sounds like that's going to be very expensive for them.

11:43.520 --> 11:48.660
But something that's not expensive are Android Go edition phones, right?

11:48.660 --> 11:55.560
And now we have Android 10, Go edition, which says it's faster and includes that new encryption

11:55.560 --> 11:59.580
that we talked about before, AdMantium, I think it was called or AdMantium.

11:59.580 --> 12:04.460
And as well as a couple other like design for mobility apps, I'm gonna say I'm a little

12:04.460 --> 12:07.240
jealous Joe, I wish I could find a phone that had Android Go on it.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.920
Adiantium, by the way, shocker that you can't pronounce something.

12:10.920 --> 12:14.160
Yeah, I'm not the official pronunciation guy.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.160
That's not me.

12:15.160 --> 12:19.480
Well, there are some Android Go edition phones available in the US, but this is very much

12:19.480 --> 12:24.840
aimed at developing markets, phones with a gigabyte and a half of memory or less.

12:24.840 --> 12:28.980
And I think realistically, if you got hold of one of these, you'd be wanting your pixel

12:28.980 --> 12:30.360
back pretty quickly.

12:30.360 --> 12:34.200
Yeah, I just I'm in love with the idea.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.240
In some places, you can get a phone for as low as $27.

12:37.240 --> 12:41.960
It might only have 3g and no storage, but $27 phone prices.

12:41.960 --> 12:45.240
I feel like I'll never see those again in my life, at least for anything that I'd want

12:45.240 --> 12:46.240
to use.

12:46.240 --> 12:52.440
But I did grab their photo go gallery app that they've made available for Android Go.

12:52.440 --> 12:56.440
They don't seem to make the YouTube Go app available, which is a bummer because I think

12:56.440 --> 13:00.080
it supports like downloading and lower bit rate videos, which would be great when I'm

13:00.080 --> 13:01.560
on a MiFi.

13:01.560 --> 13:05.140
But their photo app that they make available for Android Go is nice.

13:05.140 --> 13:07.920
It's much lighter than Google Photos.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.860
When you get an official Android device with a real Google ROM, I know you're not familiar

13:11.860 --> 13:16.620
with these, Joe, but when you get one, they got this app on there called Google Photos.

13:16.620 --> 13:19.400
And of course, it's their upload photo analysis.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.560
Get all your information service.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.100
It's pretty good.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.040
And it's pretty creepy.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.600
But it's slow sometimes, especially when you have a bad connection and you just want to

13:27.600 --> 13:29.360
view some pictures you took.

13:29.360 --> 13:32.480
And this this app that they include here is really good.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.360
You can just get it on the Play Store.

13:34.360 --> 13:36.760
So I had a big recommendation on that one.

13:36.760 --> 13:40.500
Well, YouTube wise, my recommendation for that is new pipe, which is available from

13:40.500 --> 13:41.500
F-Droid.

13:41.500 --> 13:43.760
We talked about it on Choose Linux a couple of months ago.

13:43.760 --> 13:44.760
Yeah, that's right.

13:44.760 --> 13:45.760
You should definitely check that out.

13:45.760 --> 13:50.320
That's got the different bit rates or resolutions at least and supports downloading and all

13:50.320 --> 13:53.200
sorts and yeah, completely free software as well.

13:53.200 --> 13:57.220
It's called Gallery Go and I'll try to put a link to that in the show notes to the Play

13:57.220 --> 13:58.220
Store if I can.

13:58.220 --> 14:01.240
If they'll let me, they'll probably let me at least link to the US version.

14:01.240 --> 14:05.400
But this release has come pretty soon after the regular Android 10 release.

14:05.400 --> 14:09.360
So it shows that they are still very serious about this, which isn't a huge surprise given

14:09.360 --> 14:12.080
that they do want to get into these developing markets.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.480
It is pretty quick after the release.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.480
You're right.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.920
That's a fair observation there.

14:16.920 --> 14:23.140
Also, speaking of observations, a developer, quote, a recognized developer as XDA developers.com

14:23.140 --> 14:33.520
writes it, has found a new commit merged into AOSP titled, quote, mount multiple DSU partitions

14:33.520 --> 14:40.680
when present, end quote, which looking at the code and the name of it seems to offer

14:40.680 --> 14:47.200
the ability to try out an OEM update before you commit to it.

14:47.200 --> 14:50.840
You can try it and revert back if you don't like it.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.400
Why do you suppose they would offer this, Joe?

14:52.400 --> 14:54.920
It doesn't seem like this solves the issue.

14:54.920 --> 14:59.600
The issue is people aren't updating and upgrading often enough or can't, not that they want

14:59.600 --> 15:00.600
to revert back.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.160
But maybe I'm wrong.

15:02.160 --> 15:08.240
Well, anecdotally, I've seen people who are on older versions and have updates available,

15:08.240 --> 15:11.320
but don't want to do it because they're worried it's going to break something.

15:11.320 --> 15:14.920
So maybe it's aimed at those kind of people.

15:14.920 --> 15:19.640
I mean, I always just do all the updates that I possibly can because they're generally going

15:19.640 --> 15:21.880
to be security updates as well as feature updates.

15:21.880 --> 15:27.720
But some people I've seen on iOS specifically, people just not wanting to do those updates

15:27.720 --> 15:32.360
because what if it breaks X, Y and Z and people don't like change.

15:32.360 --> 15:35.840
So giving them the option to see, okay, it's fine.

15:35.840 --> 15:39.160
Everything works and then commit to it afterwards.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.160
Seems pretty logical.

15:40.160 --> 15:41.160
Yeah, perhaps.

15:41.160 --> 15:46.140
It would be a really nice feature just in, you know, just in case you didn't like some

15:46.140 --> 15:52.060
new thing, the carrier added or the OEM added, seems really nice.

15:52.060 --> 15:58.980
Not so sure about Microsoft Edge on Linux, though, that I guess I would give it a go.

15:58.980 --> 16:01.080
But there's rumors afloat, Joe.

16:01.080 --> 16:05.600
Yeah, this week, Sean Larkin, who is the technical program manager for various things at Microsoft

16:05.600 --> 16:10.800
including Edge, tweeted, we on the Microsoft Edge team are fleshing out requirements to

16:10.800 --> 16:14.420
bring Edge to Linux, and we need your help with some assumptions.

16:14.420 --> 16:18.240
And then links to a form, which is obviously not a Google form, but looks exactly like

16:18.240 --> 16:22.160
a Google form from Microsoft Office.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.560
And they're asking developers to fill in the survey for them.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.280
So it looks like this might actually be happening then.

16:27.280 --> 16:33.160
Yeah, they're curious about the, quote, scenarios you primarily use a web browser on Linux for.

16:33.160 --> 16:37.320
Some of the options are automated testing, web development, or personal browsing.

16:37.320 --> 16:38.800
They're curious about distributions.

16:38.800 --> 16:43.680
They offer Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE, Red Hat, Fedora, and other.

16:43.680 --> 16:47.280
Just trying to get an idea of maybe who their target audience would be.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.160
And I'd say, why not give them some help?

16:49.160 --> 16:53.680
We'll have a link to the tweet and which then links to the form if you'd like to give them

16:53.680 --> 16:55.600
your take on it.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.600
It's always good to have more software on Linux.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.400
And it would be a heck of a story, and really something to watch how they pull it off, like

17:02.400 --> 17:03.680
how do they deliver it?

17:03.680 --> 17:04.680
Do they snap it?

17:04.680 --> 17:08.120
Do they make it available as a PPA?

17:08.120 --> 17:13.280
How does Microsoft ship a browser on Linux in, say, early 2020?

17:13.280 --> 17:16.960
Yeah, I'll try it out, not on my main machine, obviously.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.480
Yeah, I'd give it a go to.

17:18.480 --> 17:24.560
I would, because honestly, I probably at this point in time have more trust in my web browsing

17:24.560 --> 17:26.720
data with Microsoft than I do Google.

17:26.720 --> 17:27.720
Sorry, Googs.

17:27.720 --> 17:31.760
I know that you probably don't want to hear that, but it's just where it's at right now.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.200
That's why every day Chris is using Firefox.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.480
Every day I'm using Firefox now.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.960
I still got Chrome installed.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.360
I'm all about Firefox.

17:38.360 --> 17:42.120
Also, side note, it's butter smooth on Wayland.

17:42.120 --> 17:47.720
Well something not so smooth this week is more rumblings in this Richard Storman saga.

17:47.720 --> 17:54.120
This week he sent an email to the InfoGNU mailing list saying, on September 16, I resigned

17:54.120 --> 17:58.360
as president of the Free Software Foundation, but the GNU project and the FSF are not the

17:58.360 --> 17:59.360
same.

17:59.360 --> 18:06.000
I'm still the head of the GNU project, in brackets, the chief GNU-sense, and I intend

18:06.000 --> 18:07.200
to continue as such.

18:07.200 --> 18:09.920
He's such a funny guy, isn't he?

18:09.920 --> 18:16.560
But then, later on in the week, a post appeared in his political notes, which is kind of his

18:16.560 --> 18:17.560
blog.

18:17.560 --> 18:22.520
He probably wouldn't like it being called that, but it is, saying that he was resigning

18:22.520 --> 18:23.520
effective immediately.

18:23.520 --> 18:29.480
Yeah, the quote, I hereby step down as head of the GNU project, effective immediately.

18:29.480 --> 18:30.480
That's it.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.480
Short and sweet on his site.

18:31.480 --> 18:36.520
Yeah, there were actually a couple of these that appeared and then subsequently disappeared.

18:36.520 --> 18:40.640
And now the whole political notes section of his site is 404ing.

18:40.640 --> 18:44.920
Which was loading when we started recording this podcast, which is interesting, Joe.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.200
It's gone down since we started recording.

18:47.200 --> 18:52.800
It's all very, very strange, except if you look at the 404 message and realize that he's

18:52.800 --> 18:56.840
running Apache 2.2.22 on Debian.

18:56.840 --> 18:57.840
Right.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.200
That's an old version of Apache, Joe.

19:00.200 --> 19:03.680
There's several CVEs that don't look so good that are open for that one.

19:03.680 --> 19:08.560
Additionally, if you were to connect to his SSH server and read the banner, it appears

19:08.560 --> 19:14.800
to be a version from Debian Wheezy, which generously got its last security patches in

19:14.800 --> 19:17.860
May of 2018, and that's being pretty generous.

19:17.860 --> 19:21.560
Perhaps the internet noticed that his server's out of date and is having a poke.

19:21.560 --> 19:26.440
That's been weird, though, because if you look at his notes page, his resignation has

19:26.440 --> 19:28.440
come and gone several times.

19:28.440 --> 19:30.440
I have two tabs open right now.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.840
One tab is before we started recording, and his resignation's right on there.

19:33.840 --> 19:38.520
I hereby step down as head of the GNU project, comma, effective immediately, period, Richard

19:38.520 --> 19:41.200
Stallman, end quote, right there on my page.

19:41.200 --> 19:44.840
I open up the other tab that I just clicked on as we started talking about this, and it's

19:44.840 --> 19:45.840
gone.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.400
I don't know what this means.

19:47.400 --> 19:52.760
If you go by what's in the mailing list, the GNU info mailing list, the last post there

19:52.760 --> 19:57.480
is Richard Stallman saying he's staying, and there's been no updates to that, no other

19:57.480 --> 19:58.480
posts.

19:58.480 --> 19:59.480
So I don't know.

19:59.480 --> 20:04.520
It was up on his site, and unless he lost control of his server, it went back several

20:04.520 --> 20:05.520
times.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.760
There's archive.org examples of this, and then was taken off several times.

20:09.760 --> 20:11.440
Perhaps they're finessing the announcement.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.440
Who knows?

20:12.440 --> 20:15.840
We're going to have to watch this this week, I think.

20:15.840 --> 20:19.000
Hopefully we'll get an official announcement on that mailing list, and then we'll know

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
for sure.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Well, we'll keep you up to date.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.080
Whatever happens on this and all the other stories, go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe

20:25.080 --> 20:28.240
for all the ways to get new episodes every single week.

20:28.240 --> 20:31.760
And go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

20:31.760 --> 20:36.400
And I want to really recommend you check out Self Hosted this week, selfhosted.show slash

20:36.400 --> 20:37.400
two.

20:37.400 --> 20:42.400
We traveled to see Wendell Wilson from Level One Techs, got to tour his setup, and then

20:42.400 --> 20:47.720
sit down and talk about why self host in that episode, and it turned out fantastic, selfhosted.show

20:47.720 --> 20:48.720
slash two.

20:48.720 --> 20:52.120
Yeah, there's all sorts in there, but what jumped out at me was him talking about his

20:52.120 --> 20:55.480
home server, which he was very casual about, oh yeah, it's just this minor thing, but the

20:55.480 --> 21:00.360
storage in that thing alone, you could run a small office from, so he's very serious

21:00.360 --> 21:01.360
about this stuff.

21:01.360 --> 21:06.240
Yeah, he has a great setup and a super cool trick for presence detection, which really

21:06.240 --> 21:07.240
got me thinking.

21:07.240 --> 21:11.560
But this here show, we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and

21:11.560 --> 21:12.720
open source news.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.120
I am at Chris LAS.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.840
I'm at Joel Rissington.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.200
Thanks for joining us, and we'll see you next week.

21:19.200 --> 21:42.200
See you later.
