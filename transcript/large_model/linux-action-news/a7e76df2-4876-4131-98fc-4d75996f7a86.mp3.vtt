00:00.000 --> 00:16.120
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.120 --> 00:20.720
This is episode 30, recorded on December 3rd, 2017. I'm Chris.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.720
And I'm Joe.

00:21.720 --> 00:26.560
Hello, Joe. It's good to be connected with you again. And now that you're a Bitcoin investor,

00:26.560 --> 00:31.520
I feel like we should start this week with a little Bitcoin news. The open source money

00:31.520 --> 00:36.160
has reached $11,000 as we record this episode.

00:36.160 --> 00:42.200
Yeah, the big news was 10,000. But it's been pretty volatile since then. I've seen it down

00:42.200 --> 00:49.760
as low as, I think, just under nine and up nearly 12. But yeah, kind of 10 or 11. That

00:49.760 --> 00:55.560
is big news, though. It's a psychological barrier, isn't it, to get over 10? And people

00:55.560 --> 01:01.240
have gone crazy as a result. Even I have sold my Litecoin. And by Litecoin, I mean singular

01:01.240 --> 01:07.480
Litecoin. And now I've got like 0.0 something Bitcoin. Yes, it's still worth like 500 pounds,

01:07.480 --> 01:08.480
though.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.560
Yeah, those of us who have been following the Bitcoin phenomenon now for years know

01:12.560 --> 01:17.800
that right now there is just an incredible level of transaction volume. As we record

01:17.800 --> 01:24.640
this episode, the value of Bitcoin is changing faster than I could read it to you. It's really

01:24.640 --> 01:31.160
something to see it. It's a new level of adoption for Bitcoin when it reaches this $10,000,

01:31.160 --> 01:37.200
this big number. It's so much more than Bitcoin. It's a validation of the blockchain technology.

01:37.200 --> 01:41.620
Because what it is saying is that all of these millions of people are willing to store their

01:41.620 --> 01:47.480
value in a blockchain technology, which, by the way, is open source. And a lot of companies

01:47.480 --> 01:50.480
are trying to crack that particular nut right now.

01:50.480 --> 01:53.480
You do realize that it jumped the shark this week, of course, though, because it was on

01:53.480 --> 01:57.600
the Big Bang Theory. Oh, was it? Yeah, it was pretty funny. They must have filmed it

01:57.600 --> 02:06.840
several months ago because they're like, it's worth over $5,000. Yeah, yeah. Well, ish.

02:06.840 --> 02:13.320
This is all sort of fluctuating as we record, but it's around a market value of $180 billion

02:13.320 --> 02:18.840
right now, which is a substantial amount more than, say, General Electric, just as a reference

02:18.840 --> 02:22.920
point. Yeah, it's bigger than some countries, isn't it? It is indeed. And so if you're not

02:22.920 --> 02:26.880
a... If you haven't followed Bitcoin very closely, or if you're even a little skeptical,

02:26.880 --> 02:33.360
you might be wondering, has people just completely lost their mind? And perhaps, perhaps, but

02:33.360 --> 02:39.000
I think what you're seeing here is a validation in a couple of fundamental factors. A validation

02:39.000 --> 02:44.760
in a currency that is verified via crypto, that's a pretty big winner for Bitcoin. And

02:44.760 --> 02:50.600
then a currency that has a shared public ledger, where everything is committed, and then it

02:50.600 --> 02:56.440
is permanently committed. And these two technologies coming together, all being open source out

02:56.440 --> 03:03.120
in the public, break down national barriers. So it's a bigger thing than it is in, say,

03:03.120 --> 03:08.140
the US or any of the Western countries. Because in the Western countries, we have a pretty

03:08.140 --> 03:13.960
stable currency. We generally have governments that are considered fairly stable. And their

03:13.960 --> 03:18.660
currencies, particularly in my case, their currencies are accepted all over the world.

03:18.660 --> 03:24.320
Cash is great. Everybody loves cash, the businessman to the terrorist. They all love using cash.

03:24.320 --> 03:28.560
So when you're in the US, you look at this and you go, what is going on with this Bitcoin

03:28.560 --> 03:34.720
stuff? This is crazy. But when you're in China, when you're in Iran, when you're somewhere

03:34.720 --> 03:40.240
in like Yemen, it's a completely different story. And they have a completely different

03:40.240 --> 03:45.320
perspective. And that's going to continue to be the case for Bitcoin for a long time.

03:45.320 --> 03:51.320
We're at the very beginning here. This stuff, the currency aspect of it, is just the tip

03:51.320 --> 03:52.320
of the iceberg.

03:52.320 --> 03:57.280
Well, I know that we're not quite at the end of the year yet. So we're not quite at predictions.

03:57.280 --> 04:02.280
But this time next year, where do you see it being? I know that you're very reluctant

04:02.280 --> 04:06.480
to be pressed on this. But do you think that it's going to be anywhere near where it is

04:06.480 --> 04:09.240
now? Or is it going to be way more or way less?

04:09.240 --> 04:13.240
Well, I'll give you my framework that I use to think about it. I don't know if I'm going

04:13.240 --> 04:17.600
to be right or not. But my framework is this. If we thought it was worth $100, and then

04:17.600 --> 04:24.360
we thought it was worth $500, and then people were willing to buy it at $1,000, and then

04:24.360 --> 04:31.240
all of a sudden $5,000, and now $10,000, then what stops us from thinking it's worth $15,000?

04:31.240 --> 04:38.660
What stops us from thinking it's worth $20,000, $25,000, $50,000? I don't know where it goes.

04:38.660 --> 04:43.480
It's a limited commodity. And there's a lot of use cases, from crime to legitimate trust

04:43.480 --> 04:51.320
transactions with Bitcoin. I got to think that there's going to be a drop. There generally

04:51.320 --> 04:55.460
is. Generally, these rides come with a lot of falls. That tends to be Bitcoin's history.

04:55.460 --> 05:00.080
So it's pretty hard to pin where it's going to be at. But it could become a new normal.

05:00.080 --> 05:04.160
$10,000 could become a new normal, just like $7,000 became a new normal and $5,000 became

05:04.160 --> 05:06.160
a new normal. We'll see.

05:06.160 --> 05:09.240
Right. I take that as $100,000 then.

05:09.240 --> 05:12.040
Maybe. I hope so.

05:12.040 --> 05:18.040
The way I see it, this time next year, it's either going to be worth $100,000 or under

05:18.040 --> 05:23.480
$100,000. How ridiculous is that? That's how volatile it is as a currency.

05:23.480 --> 05:27.840
Yeah, that's true. You know what's been surprising to me and something I really didn't expect

05:27.840 --> 05:33.640
is as it's gotten closer to $10,000, more normal people have all of a sudden gotten

05:33.640 --> 05:38.600
really interested. People that were never taking Bitcoin seriously are all of a sudden

05:38.600 --> 05:45.040
investing in Bitcoin. Because you don't have to buy one $10,000 coin. You can buy fractions

05:45.040 --> 05:50.960
of a Bitcoin. You can just buy in little itty-bitsy tiny bits. And this idea seems to be really

05:50.960 --> 05:55.880
taking off in more well-to-do upper middle class Americans right now. And I'm very surprised

05:55.880 --> 06:00.840
by it. And I started to see it within some members of my family. But I'm seeing it way,

06:00.840 --> 06:04.960
way more in people that are sending me emails asking about it. It's all of a sudden gotten

06:04.960 --> 06:10.200
a level of legitimacy. And in my world, when it reached $1,000, I said to myself, I don't

06:10.200 --> 06:14.040
know if I'm ever going to, I will never buy a Bitcoin again. Maybe I'll try to mine an

06:14.040 --> 06:21.520
alt crypto, but I'm never going to buy a Bitcoin. $1,000? No way. But for a different category

06:21.520 --> 06:27.280
of investor, if you want to call them that, $10,000 is all of a sudden bringing a level

06:27.280 --> 06:32.200
of legitimacy to it that has turned their interest in, which I did not see coming. So

06:32.200 --> 06:33.960
it's really hard to peg this stuff.

06:33.960 --> 06:40.320
Yeah. And what about the forks then, like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold? They are not doing

06:40.320 --> 06:45.120
as well as they had hoped, but they haven't damaged Bitcoin at all. In fact, they've almost

06:45.120 --> 06:46.760
legitimized it.

06:46.760 --> 06:51.480
Yeah. The thing about Bitcoin that is hard to understand is what gives it value is the

06:51.480 --> 06:56.320
fact that we're willing to give it value. And I think that means original Bitcoin will

06:56.320 --> 06:59.880
always have the most value because that's the thing collectively we've all decided to

06:59.880 --> 07:05.480
give value. The only reason gold has value is because it can be applied to many industrial

07:05.480 --> 07:11.240
applications and we've all decided that this shiny rock is valuable. To bring it to more

07:11.240 --> 07:15.960
current terms, the only reason the dollar has any value is because it's something we

07:15.960 --> 07:21.320
all agree has value and the federal government accepts it to pay taxes. But it's just, it's

07:21.320 --> 07:25.880
something we've all collectively agreed upon. If tomorrow President Trump declared that

07:25.880 --> 07:31.800
we'd all have to use the Trumpian to pay our taxes and pay for goods and buy gas and groceries,

07:31.800 --> 07:35.000
the market would pretty quickly switch over to Trumpians.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.640
Yeah. That's not even that far fetched, is it? Some of the stuff he does. Yeah. Well,

07:41.640 --> 07:46.700
it remains to be seen exactly where it's going to go, but I was quite skeptical in the past.

07:46.700 --> 07:51.760
I've called it a Ponzi scheme. I'm not saying it's definitely not a Ponzi scheme, but I

07:51.760 --> 07:56.400
think that its value is going to grow and seeing a hundred thousand dollars within a

07:56.400 --> 07:59.560
year or two, I don't think he's out of the question.

07:59.560 --> 08:04.440
I think when you wrap your head around the value that the blockchain brings, in short,

08:04.440 --> 08:08.680
it's two parties that don't trust each other can use the blockchain to have a verified

08:08.680 --> 08:14.600
transaction. That has applications across industry from individual to individual. It

08:14.600 --> 08:20.760
could be huge. And once big business fully wraps its head around that, IBM, the Linux

08:20.760 --> 08:27.720
Foundation, banks, they're all working on that right now. And that could be the subtext

08:27.720 --> 08:33.100
to why Bitcoin has so much value is the fundamental technology it's based on. Big business is

08:33.100 --> 08:38.080
trying to build a new product here. And speaking of big business, there's some big business

08:38.080 --> 08:39.080
news too.

08:39.080 --> 08:44.880
Yeah. So Red Hat, Facebook, Google, and IBM have all got together to announce the Common

08:44.880 --> 08:51.240
Cure Rights Commitment, which is very, very similar to what we heard from the Linux kernel

08:51.240 --> 08:55.920
contributors and copyright holders. And their assertion that they will, instead of suing

08:55.920 --> 09:01.680
people who violate the GPL v2, they'll do their best to bring them into compliance and

09:01.680 --> 09:06.960
actually release the code and go down that route rather than the litigious one.

09:06.960 --> 09:12.600
Anybody making the code will tell you that suing companies fails all the time. They just

09:12.600 --> 09:16.960
go into a defensive posture. They shut down their contributions to open source. And they

09:16.960 --> 09:21.080
say, oh, lesson learned. We're not doing that again. Oh, that was a mistake. But when you

09:21.080 --> 09:26.340
work with them and you inspire a culture within to contribute to open source, not because

09:26.340 --> 09:32.240
they legally have to, but because it is beneficial for their development cycle and their company

09:32.240 --> 09:37.480
and their end product, you actually get a full-fledged participant in open source, which

09:37.480 --> 09:42.200
is really what we want. That's what these signing statements are about at the core of

09:42.200 --> 09:43.200
them.

09:43.200 --> 09:47.920
What Red Hat has done here is they've created something that just about any company could

09:47.920 --> 09:54.160
take and apply it to their own GPL code. It's sort of this perfect little pre-made template

09:54.160 --> 09:58.680
that lets you put in your own company name and your own couple of disclosures. You take

09:58.680 --> 10:03.480
it off the blog, and boom, you now have your own signing statement. And that's exactly

10:03.480 --> 10:07.360
what Facebook and IBM and Google have done. If you go to their blogs right now, they've

10:07.360 --> 10:13.200
taken the text that Red Hat Legal has created, and they've just adapted it for their companies,

10:13.200 --> 10:18.200
and added a few definitions. Like in the case of Google, they define a couple of the terms.

10:18.200 --> 10:23.400
One of those is they do say, we're going to warn you. We're going to tell you you're screwing

10:23.400 --> 10:28.160
up and that there may be legal action in the future. That doesn't mean we're suing you.

10:28.160 --> 10:32.560
That just lets you know that we're beginning the process, and there does need to be a corrective

10:32.560 --> 10:37.840
action. And they define how that's going to look and give these companies predictability.

10:37.840 --> 10:42.960
So businesses and enterprises that are incorporating open source software have predictability,

10:42.960 --> 10:44.840
and that's what companies are looking for.

10:44.840 --> 10:48.680
This is very much the corporate side of all this, isn't it? It's all open source, never

10:48.680 --> 10:51.200
a mention of free software in any of this.

10:51.200 --> 10:56.420
Yeah, but this is all of the legalese that is necessary to get more Linux and more open

10:56.420 --> 11:00.040
source shipping in products, in consumer products.

11:00.040 --> 11:05.200
Yeah, definitely. It's something that I think has been long overdue, really, because a lot

11:05.200 --> 11:08.980
of companies have been a bit reluctant because they are worried about getting sued because

11:08.980 --> 11:13.920
there have been some very litigious people within the force world. And now we've got

11:13.920 --> 11:18.880
a situation where a lot of the big companies and the big hitters are getting together and

11:18.880 --> 11:23.120
saying, look, we're not interested in suing. We're interested in compliance. And that to

11:23.120 --> 11:25.760
me is how it should be.

11:25.760 --> 11:29.200
I'd like to know from the audience. They can give us some feedback, linuxactionnews.com

11:29.200 --> 11:34.760
slash contact or tweet us at linuxactionnews or YouTube comment. Does this take some of

11:34.760 --> 11:40.880
the wind out of the BSD and Apache licenses? Obviously, just some of the wind. There's

11:40.880 --> 11:45.300
still lots of legitimate reasons to use those licenses. But now as a corporation with these

11:45.300 --> 11:49.080
signing statements coming along, is there less risk?

11:49.080 --> 11:53.920
Well, speaking of the kernel, there's been some clarification recently with regards the

11:53.920 --> 12:00.560
LTS kernel. And we got it wrong, didn't we? We, along with a lot of other news sites and

12:00.560 --> 12:06.840
commentators in the Linux world, had incorrectly assumed that the 4.14 LTS kernel was going

12:06.840 --> 12:12.440
to be supported for six years. And now we know that is not the case.

12:12.440 --> 12:18.560
Yeah, we thought the LTS development cycle was shifting to six years for all kernel releases

12:18.560 --> 12:23.600
that were deemed LTS. Not true. They're going to be two years. So kernel 4.14 as of right

12:23.600 --> 12:29.480
now is going to be supported for two years. And that's kind of confusing. What it means

12:29.480 --> 12:35.100
is GregKH is responsible for LTS kernels, some of which get six years, some of which

12:35.100 --> 12:39.940
get two years. And you'd be forgiven for not necessarily knowing where the deciding line

12:39.940 --> 12:46.880
is because that's in Mountain View at Google's headquarters. They decide which kernels are

12:46.880 --> 12:53.520
going to get the six year LTS. And then we just do two years as a community or Greg does

12:53.520 --> 12:58.440
default beyond that. That appears to be my take from the outside is that essentially

12:58.440 --> 13:03.360
Google or some company that probably ships a lot of Linux kernels is going to come to

13:03.360 --> 13:08.600
the maintainers and say, please, please make this one an LTS kernel for six years. We're

13:08.600 --> 13:13.880
going to have lots of hardware OEMs and system-on-a-chip manufacturers targeting this. Please, please

13:13.880 --> 13:18.600
make this one a six year. And then Greg on his empire of Linux kernels will go, yes,

13:18.600 --> 13:22.940
I have decided that that kernel shall too be six years. And then there'll be an announcement

13:22.940 --> 13:26.560
about it. But by default, all other LTS kernels, two years.

13:26.560 --> 13:32.000
Well, while it is our fault for getting this wrong, you do have to wonder, could it have

13:32.000 --> 13:35.040
been communicated a little bit more clearly from the kernel team?

13:35.040 --> 13:39.920
Yeah, I think people have been mistaking this since the announcement of Project Treble

13:39.920 --> 13:45.200
for Android. That's kind of where this began to work its way in. Either way, you're right.

13:45.200 --> 13:49.040
It's our bad. And we always try to follow up when we learn a correction. We'll always

13:49.040 --> 13:54.760
try to include it in the show or put a link in the show notes.

13:54.760 --> 13:58.880
DigitalOcean.com. Go create an account and then use our promo code. Here's the thing.

13:58.880 --> 14:04.360
It's a way to create infrastructure on demand using the Linux distribution that you choose.

14:04.360 --> 14:08.200
Ubuntu, Fedora, whatever you like. I'm not going to judge. And you can get started in

14:08.200 --> 14:13.200
less than 55 seconds. Everything you deploy, if it's the low end, like two cents an hour

14:13.200 --> 14:18.480
rig, up to the big ones with hundreds of gigs of RAM is going to have SSD storage. And then

14:18.480 --> 14:23.940
you can add and upgrade as you need. You can deploy entire application stacks, say Nextcloud,

14:23.940 --> 14:28.000
the entire thing or just the base operating system and build it yourself, however you

14:28.000 --> 14:30.360
like to do it.

14:30.360 --> 14:35.160
Very straightforward pricing, very fast networking, 40 gigabits into the hypervisors. Of course,

14:35.160 --> 14:42.120
those hypervisors run Linux, KVM for the virtualizers, and then an amazing dashboard, a dashboard

14:42.120 --> 14:46.360
for days. Whether you're an expert or rather, if you're just a beginner, you're going to

14:46.360 --> 14:50.000
love the dashboard. It works really great. And then when you're ready to automate things,

14:50.000 --> 14:54.560
they have an API that's simple, intuitive, and easy to understand with lots of open source

14:54.560 --> 14:59.160
code already written to take advantage of it. And while you're there, go to digitalocean.com,

14:59.160 --> 15:04.400
create your account, use a promo code, here's the thing, and then go to the community section.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.320
You know that Docker thing, right? How do you actually get that installed and configure

15:07.320 --> 15:11.900
it? They got a guide. digitalocean.com, create your account, promo code, here's the thing,

15:11.900 --> 15:18.880
and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Action News.

15:18.880 --> 15:22.960
So Chris, I know you've had a lot of problems with GNOME, and you've had a lot of distro

15:22.960 --> 15:28.600
hopping in the studio lately. Well, hop no more, sir. Have I got the distro for you,

15:28.600 --> 15:33.080
and that is the Raspberry Pi desktop based on Debian Stretch, Raspbian.

15:33.080 --> 15:36.240
Really? Now I can run it on my x86, eh?

15:36.240 --> 15:38.520
Yeah, exactly. PCs and Macs.

15:38.520 --> 15:42.880
Yeah, that's just so exciting. In fact, they actually specifically mentioned Macs. They

15:42.880 --> 15:47.440
say, today we're launching the first Debian Stretch release of the Raspberry Pi desktop

15:47.440 --> 15:52.800
for PCs and Macs, and we're also releasing the latest version of Raspbian Stretch for

15:52.800 --> 15:53.800
your Pi.

15:53.800 --> 15:56.580
Yeah, so have you tried this out on x86 hardware?

15:56.580 --> 16:03.440
You know, I was almost going to, and then I read that they're using the LXDE desktop

16:03.440 --> 16:09.360
still in 2017, and to be honest with you, Joe, I thought, I like some of the modifications

16:09.360 --> 16:13.480
they're making, but it's obviously not designed for me, and I didn't want to come away with

16:13.480 --> 16:14.840
a bad taste in my mouth.

16:14.840 --> 16:20.760
Well, I downloaded it, and I installed it, but then it wouldn't boot. So that kind of

16:20.760 --> 16:27.200
sucked. But then I booted it again and went into the live session, and that worked perfectly.

16:27.200 --> 16:31.160
So I don't know quite what was going on there, and my touchpad didn't work in the graphical

16:31.160 --> 16:38.040
installer, so I don't know. But anyway, let's gloss over those bad points. And if you want

16:38.040 --> 16:44.400
to have an experience on a laptop or desktop computer that is identical to that of a Pi

16:44.400 --> 16:51.240
using the official Raspbian distro, then look no further. And this doesn't make sense to

16:51.240 --> 16:55.880
almost anyone listening to our show, I don't think, because as you say, it's using this

16:55.880 --> 17:01.960
old LXDE desktop. Wayland is not even something they're thinking about. They're looking for

17:01.960 --> 17:07.640
just pure stability, something that works and has been working for a long time. And

17:07.640 --> 17:15.260
so where this is aimed is educators, teachers, parents, Raspberry Pi enthusiasts who want

17:15.260 --> 17:21.320
to have feature parity between their Pi and a desktop or laptop computer. And if you look

17:21.320 --> 17:24.640
at it from that angle, it suddenly makes a lot of sense.

17:24.640 --> 17:31.400
Yeah, I suppose, in an ideal world. So let's back up a little bit. So it is a little different.

17:31.400 --> 17:37.860
The x86 version is a bit different than the Raspberry Pi version in that it lacks Mathematica,

17:37.860 --> 17:43.620
but it includes two applications that the ARM version does not have, and I think give

17:43.620 --> 17:50.520
you an indication of where they're going. Number one is Pi Server. This allows you to

17:50.520 --> 17:57.000
set up an operating system, such as Raspbian, on the PC, which can then be shared by a number

17:57.000 --> 18:02.260
of Pi clients networked to it. It's intended to make it easy for classrooms to have multiple

18:02.260 --> 18:07.240
Pi's all running exactly the same software, and for the teacher to have control over how

18:07.240 --> 18:09.200
the software is installed and used.

18:09.200 --> 18:15.280
Yeah, you can imagine this as all the Pi's plugged into a switch, all on the same network,

18:15.280 --> 18:19.560
all the Pi's are set to boot from the network, and then you can just manage it all from one

18:19.560 --> 18:23.960
central location, rather than having to mess around with SD cards and cloning them and

18:23.960 --> 18:30.600
DDing or whatever. That makes a lot of sense to me, and to have it as an application, okay,

18:30.600 --> 18:35.160
maybe that should just be a standalone application that you can run on Windows or Linux, but

18:35.160 --> 18:40.160
well, this is a start. At least you can boot into this Raspberry Pi desktop, which they've

18:40.160 --> 18:43.400
dropped the pixel branding. I think we've talked about that in the past. Let's just

18:43.400 --> 18:49.520
gloss over that one. They learned from that mistake. But it seems to me that for its niche,

18:49.520 --> 18:50.960
this makes a lot of sense.

18:50.960 --> 18:54.760
Maybe. So the other second application they've added is, which is a great idea, I think,

18:54.760 --> 19:00.220
an application which allows you on the x86 version to easily use the GPIO pins of a Raspberry

19:00.220 --> 19:06.880
Pi Zero connected via USB to a PC in an application using Stretcher Python. These things make

19:06.880 --> 19:11.920
sense. I want to back up though for a moment and tell you where I think perhaps I smell

19:11.920 --> 19:14.880
some missteps.

19:14.880 --> 19:21.080
So first, I feel like they're not being completely genuine with the audience. Now I'm not a big

19:21.080 --> 19:26.600
Raspberry Pi insider. I don't really follow it super closely. But when I read this, it

19:26.600 --> 19:32.120
reads smarmy to me, and that comes across as deception. So I'll read the paragraph for

19:32.120 --> 19:33.120
you.

19:33.120 --> 19:39.120
When we released our custom desktop environment on Debian for PCs and Macs last year, we were

19:39.120 --> 19:44.320
slightly taken aback by how popular it turned out to be. We really only created it as a

19:44.320 --> 19:50.280
result of one of these wouldn't-it-be-cool-if conversations we sometimes have in the office.

19:50.280 --> 19:56.440
So we were delighted by the Pi community's reaction. Seeing how keen people were on the

19:56.440 --> 20:02.520
x86 version, we've decided that we're going to try to keep releasing it alongside Raspbian,

20:02.520 --> 20:05.980
the ultimate aim to make simultaneous releases of both.

20:05.980 --> 20:10.780
Now the reason I don't like this is because it reads like this. We just happen to make

20:10.780 --> 20:15.980
an x86 version. And then it just happened to be popular. And so we just happened to

20:15.980 --> 20:23.220
spend hundreds of hours of time creating the Pi server to enable a total thin client environment

20:23.220 --> 20:27.500
around the Raspberry Pi. We just happened to create a software middle layer that will

20:27.500 --> 20:33.080
map GPIO pins on a USB-attached Raspberry Pi Zero to a Python application you're developing

20:33.080 --> 20:36.120
on a Linux desktop. Oops! Just happened to do that.

20:36.120 --> 20:40.280
And so here it is, everybody. And now we're going to alter our entire development scope

20:40.280 --> 20:46.520
to match these two releases up and synchronize their releases. That just happened. It just

20:46.520 --> 20:52.960
happened. And that reads as disingenuous to me. I don't disagree with them releasing on

20:52.960 --> 20:57.840
x86 and completing a product and making a development environment where you can use

20:57.840 --> 21:02.400
a larger powerful PC for applications that you might run on a Pi. That seems like a great

21:02.400 --> 21:08.000
idea too. But their messaging comes across as disingenuous. This feels like a part of

21:08.000 --> 21:13.320
a larger plan, a bigger strategy, but they don't know how to message it to the open source

21:13.320 --> 21:16.520
community. Just like they didn't know how to message the Pixel desktop, they're not

21:16.520 --> 21:21.040
messaging this correctly. And if you look at their approach around using LXDE, that's

21:21.040 --> 21:26.060
the second red flag. Now, no disrespect to LXDE. I love me a lightweight efficient Linux

21:26.060 --> 21:31.400
desktop that works for your workflow. That's awesome. But when asked about it, Simon Long

21:31.400 --> 21:36.160
says we've invested a lot of time and effort into LXDE-based solutions and see no reason

21:36.160 --> 21:40.760
to change. It works well for what we require. So then a commenter named Mike says, well,

21:40.760 --> 21:46.840
what about Wayland and Weston? LXDE seems to be dead, like a dead end to me. Simon replies,

21:46.840 --> 21:52.440
Simon again involved in all of this replies, LXDE is a mature working stable desktop environment,

21:52.440 --> 21:56.840
which does everything we need it to. This notion of dead ends is not one into which

21:56.840 --> 22:02.760
I subscribe to. As if software being end of life is a theory that one can subscribe to

22:02.760 --> 22:07.700
or not. So that's red flag number one. And then the second part is, we investigated Wayland

22:07.700 --> 22:12.160
seven years ago and decided it didn't go with anything we needed and was too bleeding edge

22:12.160 --> 22:18.740
to move to. They go on to say, we'll go on for a while because LXDE does everything we

22:18.740 --> 22:24.440
need, essentially, and don't anticipate that changing anytime soon. We'll stick with that

22:24.440 --> 22:28.400
desktop environment that we spent over three years tweaking, debugging, improving. Newer

22:28.400 --> 22:33.240
is not the same as better, certainly not in the world of software. But see, this betrays

22:33.240 --> 22:38.160
a fundamental huge misunderstanding about open source software. Because what people

22:38.160 --> 22:42.160
are really saying when they're asking about the future of LXDE is they're saying, well,

22:42.160 --> 22:47.800
what are you going to do? Are you going to maintain LXDE on X all on your own? Are you

22:47.800 --> 22:53.440
going to maintain Xorg and LXDE one day all on your own? Are you going to run a Raspbian

22:53.440 --> 22:58.760
fork of that desktop when the rest of the open source community is developing other

22:58.760 --> 23:02.120
solutions and moving towards Wayland? Are you going to go at your own just like you're

23:02.120 --> 23:07.440
going at your own on these other projects? It doesn't make sense. And it betrays a fundamental

23:07.440 --> 23:11.680
misunderstanding of the open source community and what they're even asking for.

23:11.680 --> 23:15.760
But hang on, it's all working fine right now. So therefore, it's going to work forever,

23:15.760 --> 23:16.760
right?

23:16.760 --> 23:20.360
Right. But when you're built, that's great for an end user, right? That's great. Great.

23:20.360 --> 23:24.800
That is super great for an end user, and that's how it should be. When you're a platform developer,

23:24.800 --> 23:29.240
when you're creating a platform for educators, for things that are going to schools for years,

23:29.240 --> 23:33.720
for things that students to learn upon, you have to think more than two years down the

23:33.720 --> 23:38.320
road. And you have to think about your resources and the people available to develop projects

23:38.320 --> 23:43.100
and how much you want to take on as a company yourself or as a foundation. How much in-house

23:43.100 --> 23:47.160
development do you want to do? How many software projects do you want?

23:47.160 --> 23:52.200
Now you've got an ARM distro and an x86 distro, both of which are now diverging from each

23:52.200 --> 23:55.380
other. How much further do you want to go down that path?

23:55.380 --> 23:58.920
But going back to your other point about education and creating an environment that's on the

23:58.920 --> 24:04.000
Pi and the desktop that are similar, I do kind of, I grok that. That makes sense to

24:04.000 --> 24:09.360
me. I'm doubtful that large IT organizations in these school districts are going to standardize

24:09.360 --> 24:14.240
on the Raspbian desktop, but I could see it in a few areas. I could see it in some workshops.

24:14.240 --> 24:19.480
I could see it in projects at home. And so it does make some sense to me. But there are

24:19.480 --> 24:21.240
those red flags there that I can't ignore.

24:21.240 --> 24:26.280
Yeah, well, you talk about workshops and stuff. They recently released that Makerspace magazine.

24:26.280 --> 24:30.920
So it kind of fits in with those smaller organizations, doesn't it?

24:30.920 --> 24:36.240
Yeah. And in that context, I can see it making sense. I hope that they understand that there

24:36.240 --> 24:40.680
is a certain point in which you need to just sort of go with the flow of open source. Canonical

24:40.680 --> 24:45.280
recently learned that lesson with Unity, and now they're working upstream with Gnome. That

24:45.280 --> 24:48.560
ticket will eventually come due for Raspbian too.

24:48.560 --> 24:55.080
Yeah. Well, we'll have to see. Well, let's talk about Mozilla. Now, you are a big fan,

24:55.080 --> 25:01.080
Chris, of voice assistants. You use your Amazon thing quite a lot to control things. And I've

25:01.080 --> 25:05.360
been skeptical of it. I have no interest in having a box listening to me all the time.

25:05.360 --> 25:12.200
But it seems that I'm a bit weird in that sense, because this is taking off massively.

25:12.200 --> 25:19.280
But the problem is the Alexa thing, Apple's one, Google's one, they're all proprietary

25:19.280 --> 25:25.520
and using a proprietary backend. Mozilla have decided to step up and see that this is part

25:25.520 --> 25:29.920
of the future, at least, if not the future. And now they've released their open source

25:29.920 --> 25:36.440
speech recognition model, which is pretty accurate. It seems that Mozilla are not being

25:36.440 --> 25:41.960
left behind on this. They're not doing a Firefox OS and waiting for the competitors to get

25:41.960 --> 25:47.320
way advanced. Maybe they're a little bit behind, but I think that they're far less behind than

25:47.320 --> 25:51.360
they were before. And it's good to see this, even though it's something I don't have a

25:51.360 --> 25:56.920
massive interest in. I think that it's good that we have Mozilla and who better than Mozilla

25:56.920 --> 26:01.640
to pioneer this space in an open source way.

26:01.640 --> 26:07.600
Yeah. So for full context here, speech recognition, the backend, real compute aspect to it, and

26:07.600 --> 26:12.120
all of the data is really locked down to like two, maybe three companies if you want to

26:12.120 --> 26:16.520
be generous. And so if you're working on a Mycroft project or even building a point of

26:16.520 --> 26:20.600
sale kiosk where you want to have voice recognition, you got to work with one of these companies

26:20.600 --> 26:27.240
and their incredible prices and their entire closed nature to have any success at all.

26:27.240 --> 26:31.760
So we've talked about project common voice in the past. This is the voice and speech

26:31.760 --> 26:37.400
data aspect of what Mozilla is working on. And today they're talking about project deep

26:37.400 --> 26:44.580
speech. Now project deep speech is the compute and algorithms that actually analyze the data.

26:44.580 --> 26:48.640
This is all open source stuff that the Mozilla Foundation is working on. And they're claiming

26:48.640 --> 26:55.000
that their speech to text engine has an error rate of just 6%. Essentially on a clean data

26:55.000 --> 27:00.280
set, it has the error rate of a human in understanding. And they're making this available to anyone,

27:00.280 --> 27:05.000
including all of the data. You can go download all 12 gigs of it right now.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.080
And this is the sort of thing that we want to see Mozilla doing, isn't it?

27:08.080 --> 27:11.160
Yeah. This is a considerable amount of data that they're contributing. I mean, it's just

27:11.160 --> 27:15.240
huge really. It's hard to even state it. And they're just getting started. They're working

27:15.240 --> 27:19.920
with English right now. And this is from their article, their blog post. They say they're

27:19.920 --> 27:24.680
working hard to ensure that common voice will support voice donations in multiple languages

27:24.680 --> 27:26.720
beginning in the first half of 2018.

27:26.720 --> 27:31.800
Yeah. It's kind of a shame that this didn't happen a year or two ago for Mycroft's sake,

27:31.800 --> 27:36.000
because maybe they'd be a lot further along had it happened then.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.560
So you might be wondering, how does Mozilla afford to do all of this? Well, actually we

27:40.560 --> 27:45.200
have a little bit of insights into that. You can read the full article at linuxactionnews.com.

27:45.200 --> 27:50.520
slash 30, but they've posted their annual report for 2016. And there's a brief here

27:50.520 --> 27:53.600
that I want to read because I think it'll help everybody understand how Mozilla works

27:53.600 --> 27:54.600
a little better.

27:54.600 --> 27:58.740
Mozilla is not your average organization. It was founded as a community open source

27:58.740 --> 28:07.520
project in 1998. Mozilla is structured as two organizations. The 501c3 Mozilla Foundation,

28:07.520 --> 28:11.320
which backs emerging leaders and mobilizes citizens to create global movement for the

28:11.320 --> 28:17.360
health of the internet. That's how I like that. And then their wholly owned subsidiary,

28:17.360 --> 28:22.680
the Mozilla Corporation, which creates products and explores new technologies that gives people

28:22.680 --> 28:28.000
more control over their lives and basically makes the Firefox and Thunderbird product,

28:28.000 --> 28:29.000
I believe.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.920
So you have two organizations, sort of the aspirational foundation and the corporation,

28:32.920 --> 28:38.280
which is making the products. And together, they're actually making pretty good money.

28:38.280 --> 28:44.280
Even though we've talked a lot about how Chrome and WebKit in general are dominating the web,

28:44.280 --> 28:45.280
Mozilla's had a good year.

28:45.280 --> 28:46.280
Yeah, thanks, Marissa.

28:46.280 --> 28:49.920
Yeah, really. There's some deals that they had in place. I mean, the big part of their

28:49.920 --> 28:54.520
revenue undoubtedly comes from search. Going back to Google and integrating their search

28:54.520 --> 29:02.880
partnerships, they earn the bulk of their revenue there. In 2015, they earned 414 million

29:02.880 --> 29:08.560
from their search deals. And in 2016, they've earned 506 million. They've localized a little

29:08.560 --> 29:12.080
more. So it's not just Google across the board. In different regions, they're going with more

29:12.080 --> 29:16.680
regional specific search engines. And here in the States, it's back to Google.

29:16.680 --> 29:22.600
Well, I can't wait to see this time next year when we get the 2017 numbers and see quite

29:22.600 --> 29:28.960
how much of that Yahoo money plus the new Google money is working out because it's got

29:28.960 --> 29:33.040
to be more than this, I would have thought, because they're getting paid twice now for

29:33.040 --> 29:34.040
search.

29:34.040 --> 29:37.640
You know, you often talk about how they spend their money. I think you probably like this.

29:37.640 --> 29:42.600
So the foundation, which is the more aspirational stuff, has about 80 employees and then about

29:42.600 --> 29:48.360
a thousand or more volunteers around the world. 80 employees for the foundation. But the corporation,

29:48.360 --> 29:52.160
the one making the products that you and I talk about all the time, a thousand employees

29:52.160 --> 29:55.520
worldwide. A thousand. That's a much bigger investment.

29:55.520 --> 30:00.720
The foundation does seem to be more volunteer driven. So some of these things that come

30:00.720 --> 30:04.320
out, some of these initiatives that you hear about from Mozilla, because both of these,

30:04.320 --> 30:09.480
the corporation and the foundation, they operate together as Mozilla. So sometimes what you're

30:09.480 --> 30:14.720
hearing about is just from a group of 80 people plus a bunch of volunteers. But the code that

30:14.720 --> 30:18.920
we all use every day is where the real employment and staffing investment is.

30:18.920 --> 30:22.600
Kind of reminds me of the Raspberry Pi Foundation. They have a similar setup that they've got

30:22.600 --> 30:29.280
two very distinct entities. Raspberry Pi Trading, which is what sells all of the pies and makes

30:29.280 --> 30:33.600
all the money. And then the Raspberry Pi Foundation, which is what spends all the money on the

30:33.600 --> 30:36.960
various education and outreach stuff and the magazines and everything.

30:36.960 --> 30:41.380
You know, I'll just wrap it up with this. My personal thoughts are Firefox is stronger

30:41.380 --> 30:46.480
than ever. 57 really did win me over. With the exception of just a couple of machines

30:46.480 --> 30:51.280
here in the studio, all of my machines and my machine at home are now running Firefox.

30:51.280 --> 30:55.520
And it does honestly feel faster and like it puts less load on my Linux box than Chrome

30:55.520 --> 30:57.160
does. And that's all it took for me.

30:57.160 --> 31:01.360
Well, I'm still using it. I haven't made the switch just yet. And I also have not made

31:01.360 --> 31:09.920
the switch to Sailfish OS, despite Yola's attempts to popularize it. And they've posted

31:09.920 --> 31:15.280
an update talking about Sailfish X, which is on the Xperia X and how that seems to be

31:15.280 --> 31:20.160
going well for them. And also they seem to be jumping on the blockchain bandwagon.

31:20.160 --> 31:25.320
Yeah. So this is the six week checkup. Can you believe it has been six weeks since we

31:25.320 --> 31:29.440
talked about Sailfish X and all of that? And they say it's going well, Joe. And they're

31:29.440 --> 31:34.900
expanding the program. They're going to focus on new Sony Xperia hardware in 2018. And they're

31:34.900 --> 31:39.800
going all in, like you said, on blockchain. They're working with a company called Zipper

31:39.800 --> 31:46.600
Global Limited, which is a blockchain specialized company. They work with Ethereum products.

31:46.600 --> 31:50.920
Here's your translation. And they're going to develop the world's first blockchain solutions

31:50.920 --> 31:56.800
on top of an open mobile operating system. These all sound like really big goals, like

31:56.800 --> 32:00.760
big things. And they back it up. They say the program is going to be utilizing Sailfish

32:00.760 --> 32:06.600
X as a development platform and targets to offer the world's best open source development

32:06.600 --> 32:12.800
environment for the rapidly expanding developer community of blockchain application developers.

32:12.800 --> 32:17.200
That's a lot of buzzwords and blockchain and developers, Joe. It's like a soup right there.

32:17.200 --> 32:22.180
Well, yeah, it used to be that you'd go into a VC meeting, mentioned VR, and they'd just

32:22.180 --> 32:27.120
throw money at you. Now the key word is blockchain and they throw money at you. And that's what

32:27.120 --> 32:32.600
this feels like. I can't see anything concrete at all here. I can see a lot of buzzwords

32:32.600 --> 32:36.720
and a lot of what looks like vaporware, but I just don't really see anything concrete

32:36.720 --> 32:41.680
and any details on how this is actually going to work. Did I miss something here?

32:41.680 --> 32:45.720
I tend to agree. I think there's a couple of ideas in here that if you had a company

32:45.720 --> 32:51.160
that had some real scale and some real user base might actually gain traction. And it

32:51.160 --> 32:56.520
seems easy enough. You just create your own crypto coin. The platform will have its own

32:56.520 --> 33:02.440
currency. It's called Zip and it's going to fuel the community and platform development.

33:02.440 --> 33:06.600
They're going to have like an incentive for the users, too. So it's not just going to

33:06.600 --> 33:13.120
be for developers. And as you create applications or give feedback or submit bug fixes, you

33:13.120 --> 33:17.800
could get Zip currency. And then maybe this Zip currency could be converted into something

33:17.800 --> 33:26.680
that actually matters. I don't know. But that idea might actually have something to it.

33:26.680 --> 33:31.720
If you're a large, say you're a Samsung, say you're a Google, if you're a large open source

33:31.720 --> 33:36.740
project and you could just go fork Litecoin and call it JoeCoin, and then all of a sudden

33:36.740 --> 33:41.080
everybody who's contributing to Project Joe gets a little bit of JoeCoin, you just need

33:41.080 --> 33:45.160
one exchange to convert that to Bitcoin and well, Bob's your uncle. You now got yourself

33:45.160 --> 33:46.160
a cryptocurrency.

33:46.160 --> 33:51.440
Yeah, I suppose. It just feels like an ICO, an initial coin offering to me.

33:51.440 --> 33:55.760
Yeah, it's a way to generate hype and value on a platform that otherwise wouldn't have

33:55.760 --> 33:56.760
it.

33:56.760 --> 34:01.400
Yeah. Just think that this week, especially with Bitcoin, as we said at the top of the

34:01.400 --> 34:06.640
show, topping 10,000, it just seems an awfully convenient time to announce this, doesn't

34:06.640 --> 34:07.640
it?

34:07.640 --> 34:10.640
Yeah. I mean, it is our job to be skeptical and look at these things from an objective

34:10.640 --> 34:15.240
position. But if something interesting develops here or another open source project takes

34:15.240 --> 34:18.760
this idea and runs with it, we might just be the very first place to tell you about

34:18.760 --> 34:23.680
it. In fact, you can get every single episode every week. Go to linuxactionnews.com slash

We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

34:38.680 --> 34:40.560
I'm at Chris LAS.

34:40.560 --> 34:42.200
I'm at Joe Ressington.

34:42.200 --> 34:44.920
Thank you for joining us and we'll see you next week.
