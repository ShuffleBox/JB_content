00:00.000 --> 00:09.760
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 127, recorded on October 13, 2019. I'm Chris.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.760
And I'm Joe.

00:10.760 --> 00:15.720
Hello, Joe. Good to be connected with you. Richard Stallman is the top of the news again

00:15.720 --> 00:16.720
this week.

00:16.720 --> 00:22.540
Yeah, last time we talked about him and his resigning from the FSF and MIT, we weren't

00:22.540 --> 00:26.860
sure what was going to happen with GNU, and things were a little bit uncertain with his

00:26.860 --> 00:31.960
website and everything. Well, then subsequently, it has turned out that he has not resigned

00:31.960 --> 00:38.080
from GNU. He's very much still the chief GNU-sense, as he puts it. And since that clarification,

00:38.080 --> 00:40.400
there's been a bit of controversy about that.

00:40.400 --> 00:46.280
This became news this week, primarily because the FSF released a statement, and we'll have

00:46.280 --> 00:50.820
the full statement linked in the show notes. But in part, it reads, GNU decision making

00:50.820 --> 00:56.840
has largely been in the hands of GNU leadership. Since RMS resigned as president of the FSF,

00:56.840 --> 01:05.360
but not as head of GNU, the FSF is now working with GNU leadership on a shared understanding

01:05.360 --> 01:11.760
of the relationship for the future. Now, that was published on October 6 of 2019. On October

01:11.760 --> 01:18.680
7 of 2019, a joint statement of the GNU project was released on the Geeks blog.

01:18.680 --> 01:24.800
Yeah, and this has been signed by a seemingly ever-growing list of GNU developers. And it

01:24.800 --> 01:29.320
basically says, thanks for all you've done, Stallman, but we don't want you to be in charge

01:29.320 --> 01:30.320
anymore.

01:30.320 --> 01:35.960
As we record this episode, that is 27 GNU maintainers have signed this letter. To put

01:35.960 --> 01:42.520
that in perspective, there's somewhere between 300 and 400 GNU maintainers overall. So you

01:42.520 --> 01:48.040
have just an idea here of what the actual ratio is. The next day, on the InfoGNU mailing

01:48.040 --> 01:53.360
list, which we talked about recently, Richard Stallman himself made a very quick post. He

01:53.360 --> 01:57.640
says, as the chief GNU-sense, I'd like to reassure the community that there won't be

01:57.640 --> 02:03.680
any radical changes in the GNU project's goals, principles, and policies. I would like to

02:03.680 --> 02:10.220
make incremental changes in some decisions because I won't be here forever. And we need

02:10.220 --> 02:15.640
to ready others to make GNU project decisions when I can no longer do so.

02:15.640 --> 02:21.100
So my personal read of that, Joe, is that Richard Stallman saying, I'm not going anywhere.

02:21.100 --> 02:25.920
I'm not even challenged about going anywhere. But we will make some slight modifications

02:25.920 --> 02:27.200
to reduce bus factor.

02:27.200 --> 02:31.600
That is one way to look at it. Another way to look at it is he's pretty much paying lip

02:31.600 --> 02:37.840
service to the idea that he won't be in charge. It feels very much like he feels that it's

02:37.840 --> 02:42.280
his baby, his project, and he's in charge of it.

02:42.280 --> 02:47.800
Well, he's right. It is. My understanding is GNU is not even a legal entity. It's not

02:47.800 --> 02:54.420
a charity. You can't give money to the GNU project. And besides the manifesto, GNU has

02:54.420 --> 03:00.120
no bylaws. It has no constitution. It has no founding document. You could describe GNU

03:00.120 --> 03:06.840
as a set of software packages that have been designated by RMS, really, as a forming part

03:06.840 --> 03:14.400
of GNU. It's as much of a group of maintainers and a philosophy as it is an organization.

03:14.400 --> 03:19.200
It's really, it's not something you can take from the man. You know what I mean? It's not

03:19.200 --> 03:22.800
something you can take from him. It's his. GNU is Richard Stallman.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.680
I suppose it's a loose collective of people who generally agree with his ideals.

03:26.680 --> 03:30.640
Right. I suppose that that loose collective could say, well, we'll follow somebody else's

03:30.640 --> 03:37.440
leadership going forward. But consider those that have stuck around this long have likely

03:37.440 --> 03:43.160
come to peace with who Richard Stallman is, except for that 30 or so that we've seen so

03:43.160 --> 03:44.160
far.

03:44.160 --> 03:49.600
So if it is such a small ratio of them, then the chances are that nothing's going to change

03:49.600 --> 03:54.960
here and it's just going to be business as usual. And the FSF is in a very awkward position

03:54.960 --> 04:00.280
where they have to decide what to do. I can't see a simple solution for them.

04:00.280 --> 04:05.400
I suppose some of these projects could spin off on their own. However, some of them are

04:05.400 --> 04:13.760
fairly significant. There's some maintainers of GCC, GNU GPG, Emacs, and a few other

04:13.760 --> 04:20.200
essential things that we rely upon like DNS utilities that are on this list. So if they

04:20.200 --> 04:26.560
chose to split off, it would be a pretty significant loss for GNU. So they do need to resolve this.

04:26.560 --> 04:30.640
And I think that's why they're doing these joint statements and they're attempting to

04:30.640 --> 04:35.960
really sort of parse this as carefully as they can. But there is pressure from a influential

04:35.960 --> 04:40.360
group of people saying there needs to be change here. But at the end of the day, there's no

04:40.360 --> 04:48.240
board to kick RMS off. There's no legal entity to go after. So it's a particular challenge.

04:48.240 --> 04:52.600
I suppose they could start the Nuganoo. Neo-Ganoo? I don't know.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.600
Nuganoo or something, yeah.

04:54.600 --> 04:55.600
Yeah.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.160
Well, I get the feeling that this is going to rumble on for quite a while. I don't think

04:59.160 --> 05:01.840
we're going to have a conclusion to it anytime soon.

05:01.840 --> 05:06.360
They just need a good message, Joe. At least that's according to SUSE. You just say you're

05:06.360 --> 05:11.720
focused on customers and then pretty much anything flies. Headline from the SUSE blog,

05:11.720 --> 05:17.120
quote, SUSE is focusing on application delivery to meet customer needs. In other words, they're

05:17.120 --> 05:19.800
dropping OpenStack and getting all in on Kubernetes.

05:19.800 --> 05:24.040
Well, as they say in this blog post, this decision clearly aligns with the developments

05:24.040 --> 05:27.800
in the market. And that's the feeling that I've had for quite some time. I mean, all

05:27.800 --> 05:33.800
of us have, right? That OpenStack is yesterday's news and now it's all about Kubernetes.

05:33.800 --> 05:41.280
I guess so, yeah. It's a big deal to see SUSE make this change though. I laugh at spinning

05:41.280 --> 05:46.460
this as customer focused because what about all the OpenStack customers that they've been

05:46.460 --> 05:49.560
selling to for a while? Not so great for those customers.

05:49.560 --> 05:53.240
Well, they do say they're going to keep supporting them throughout the length of their contract.

05:53.240 --> 05:58.480
Yeah, that's all good and well. They've invested pretty significantly into an infrastructure

05:58.480 --> 06:03.120
that, oh, by the way, we're no longer supporting because customers. But it does seem to be

06:03.120 --> 06:09.040
the way of the future. And I can really appreciate how the SUSE folks feel that they have a unique

06:09.040 --> 06:13.920
opportunity where they're not aligned with any one particular vendor. They're sort of

06:13.920 --> 06:18.800
the perfect neutral solution for this part in the stack. And when the distribution becomes

06:18.800 --> 06:24.680
merely an implementation detail and you're not really too set on what the base image

06:24.680 --> 06:30.120
is, barring many factors, then perhaps SUSE has a shot.

06:30.120 --> 06:34.720
I mean, I'm kind of reaching here, Joe, because to be honest, this would have been a hell

06:34.720 --> 06:36.680
of an announcement three years ago.

06:36.680 --> 06:40.800
Well, to get ahead of the game rather than follow it like they seemingly are now.

06:40.800 --> 06:45.600
Right. There is a quote in their blog that really cements this. They say, quote, as we

06:45.600 --> 06:51.680
make these bold customer driven investments and in order to maximize these opportunities,

06:51.680 --> 06:57.420
SUSE has carefully reviewed its business and has decided to cease production of new versions

06:57.420 --> 07:03.920
of SUSE OpenStack Cloud and to discontinue sales of SUSE OpenStack Cloud. It's a reaction.

07:03.920 --> 07:07.720
Well, they must have been looking at the numbers in the spreadsheets and realized that they're

07:07.720 --> 07:12.800
just not selling enough of it and therefore it doesn't make sense to keep doing it.

07:12.800 --> 07:16.760
Absolutely fair enough. Fair enough. But a real market leader and somebody who's going

07:16.760 --> 07:22.120
to pull ahead of the pack and really differentiate would have been onto that signal a while ago.

07:22.120 --> 07:27.400
That's my personal take. Just witnessing how Canonical and Red Hat have changed their business

07:27.400 --> 07:33.600
models to respond to the reality we live in, it's a little disappointing to see SUSE literally

07:33.600 --> 07:37.960
the last one to make this connection. And I think there could have been a way to bridge

07:37.960 --> 07:41.840
this gap a little more elegantly than they are doing now instead of this hard shift and

07:41.840 --> 07:47.360
now it's in support mode. But the details will definitely be what makes the difference

07:47.360 --> 07:48.800
in this particular story.

07:48.800 --> 07:52.960
Well, the details are what a lot of people were worried about with Google's AMP, formerly

07:52.960 --> 07:55.120
accelerated mobile pages.

07:55.120 --> 08:00.920
When they made that big, huge shift in governance model, one of the details they hinted at was

08:00.920 --> 08:06.080
that they may move AMP under a totally separate foundation than from under Google. Now we

08:06.080 --> 08:11.280
know that's the OpenJS Foundation. And we should probably mention upfront that AMP is

08:11.280 --> 08:16.740
joining the incubation program for the OpenJS Foundation. And to understand what that is,

08:16.740 --> 08:22.960
they write on their website, quote, over the coming months, AMP will work with the OpenJS

08:22.960 --> 08:27.540
Foundation to complete the onboarding checklist and then join the foundation.

08:27.540 --> 08:32.480
So there's this sort of incubator stage that they can get some of the benefits of being

08:32.480 --> 08:37.380
part of the foundation right now, some of the governance benefits, then they have time

08:37.380 --> 08:43.220
to complete the rest of the onboarding process. And Google will continue to employ staff to

08:43.220 --> 08:50.400
work on the AMP project full time. And also worth noting, Google is already a platinum

08:50.400 --> 08:57.800
member of the OpenJS Foundation and provides additional financial and other forms of support

08:57.800 --> 09:03.080
to the foundation already. So they're going to be great. I think that onboarding process

09:03.080 --> 09:04.480
is going to go real smooth.

09:04.480 --> 09:10.480
Yeah. And essentially, not much is really going to change, at least for now. But what's

09:10.480 --> 09:15.720
interesting is that they've chosen now, when AMP is about four years old, to transfer it

09:15.720 --> 09:22.420
out of Google's control completely, it seems like they waited long enough for it to properly

09:22.420 --> 09:28.440
establish itself as the standard. And they've kind of won at this point. And so they don't

09:28.440 --> 09:32.700
really need to be in full control of it anymore.

09:32.700 --> 09:40.460
I see it differently. I see it as the new version of a code dump. Only now there's foundations

09:40.460 --> 09:45.920
in the mix. So you build something up, you quote unquote open source it, but yet you

09:45.920 --> 09:51.460
maintain total control over it. You push it down the pipeline of existing value products

09:51.460 --> 09:56.940
that you already have and mandate adoption. And then you move it to a foundation which

09:56.940 --> 10:04.040
you are one of the primary financial and other quote unquote contributors to. And then you

10:04.040 --> 10:10.240
have heavy influence because A, you're supporting the foundation, and B, you're employing the

10:10.240 --> 10:12.940
full time developers of AMP.

10:12.940 --> 10:19.960
So it's sort of, I think, modern day. Let's be futuristic. Let's say it's the 2020 version

10:19.960 --> 10:23.920
of a code dump where you used to develop something and then just say, here it is. Here's a whole

10:23.920 --> 10:28.520
big bunch of code. Go use it, everybody. It's great. It works great. Now it's this. You

10:28.520 --> 10:33.080
build something up internally. You call it open source. You get adoption. And then you

10:33.080 --> 10:41.560
have, I'm going to say it, a puppet foundation. And you're set. You're all set. And I suppose

10:41.560 --> 10:46.700
it's still better than fully closed commercial software because at least it's a foundation

10:46.700 --> 10:54.180
and at least there's some oversight. And we have overview of open source code. So it's

10:54.180 --> 10:56.260
better than the alternative still.

10:56.260 --> 11:01.060
But it's not a proper open standard, really. They can dress it up as such, but you're saying

11:01.060 --> 11:02.540
that it just isn't.

11:02.540 --> 11:09.380
Not today, I suppose. Like so many of these things, five, 10 years from now, time will

11:09.380 --> 11:15.580
tell. We'll see. We will see how much influence Google leverages over the OpenJS Foundation.

11:15.580 --> 11:20.300
Perhaps it's a non-issue, but only time will tell us. I mean, they could proclaim from

11:20.300 --> 11:25.340
the tops of the hills that they are under no influence, but only truly their actions

11:25.340 --> 11:26.500
will tell us the real story.

11:26.500 --> 11:32.060
I can't help but think back to Kubernetes and how they did a fairly similar thing with

11:32.060 --> 11:33.060
that.

11:33.060 --> 11:39.300
Fair enough, I suppose. And in that instance, they were really coming from an underdog standpoint.

11:39.300 --> 11:44.820
The Google Cloud was the smaller of the available commercial cloud options. And so coming out

11:44.820 --> 11:50.740
with something that was cross cloud was perfect for them. In this situation, I think they've

11:50.740 --> 11:55.340
been met with a lot of resistance because they're so dominant in web search and in the

11:55.340 --> 11:59.060
web browser. So the stakes are just so much higher this time around.

11:59.060 --> 12:05.060
Well, Google's next big thing is Stadia, their cloud gaming platform. And they made a pretty

12:05.060 --> 12:06.860
audacious claim this week.

12:06.860 --> 12:12.380
Right. This is based on comments from a top streaming engineer, Alex Wiltshire from Google.

12:12.380 --> 12:18.460
He says the company is verging on gaming superiority from anything a PC could do in the next two

12:18.460 --> 12:23.300
years. Quote, ultimately, we think in a year or two we'll have games that are running faster

12:23.300 --> 12:30.300
and feel more responsive in the cloud than they do locally, regardless of how powerful

12:30.300 --> 12:32.020
the local machine is.

12:32.020 --> 12:38.000
So he's claiming that not only is Stadia going to be on a par with a local Xbox or whatever,

12:38.000 --> 12:42.380
it's going to actually be better. How is that even possible?

12:42.380 --> 12:48.900
Well, it's all thanks to something called negative latency, which will act as a workaround

12:48.900 --> 12:53.340
for any potential lag between the player and the server. This is according to him. And

12:53.340 --> 12:59.020
of course, it really comes down to a data angle. I mean, this is Google. The term describes

12:59.020 --> 13:04.860
a buffer of predicted latency, which is inherent to Stadia players and their connection. It'll

13:04.860 --> 13:10.540
figure that out as you play. So then after the Stadia system figures out your particulars,

13:10.540 --> 13:16.260
it will begin what's called lag mitigation. This will include increasing the frame rates

13:16.260 --> 13:20.340
rapidly in a bursty mode when needed and then lowering them in other situations to reduce

13:20.340 --> 13:27.420
latency that the player perceives unbelievably, but yet so googly at the same time. It will

13:27.420 --> 13:34.860
even try to predict user inputs and in certain situations play for you when there's latency

13:34.860 --> 13:35.860
disruption.

13:35.860 --> 13:38.980
So you're telling me that it's going to speculate what buttons you're going to press and then

13:38.980 --> 13:41.420
execute them ahead of time, right?

13:41.420 --> 13:45.820
It's going to learn how you play. It's going to learn the particulars of your connection

13:45.820 --> 13:51.640
and its issues. And then it's going to step in for you when the connection can't keep

13:51.640 --> 13:56.340
up in a way that you don't really perceive anything has happened.

13:56.340 --> 13:59.660
So speculative execution, what could go wrong?

13:59.660 --> 14:05.100
Also, you have to ask yourself, who's actually playing the game at that point? I guess you're

14:05.100 --> 14:08.420
still having a good time because your game's not getting screwed up.

14:08.420 --> 14:13.880
Yeah, people are comparing it to aim assist and stuff like that. It just seems a bit too

14:13.880 --> 14:19.500
futuristic and quite frankly impossible, really. I can imagine on a basic 2D game or something,

14:19.500 --> 14:25.580
you could do this quite easily. But on these really complex first person shooters and stuff,

14:25.580 --> 14:31.220
how is that even possible to anticipate what moves you're going to make? It just seems

14:31.220 --> 14:34.420
like an impossible dream to me.

14:34.420 --> 14:38.380
Unless you consider that they could have tens of thousands of other people playing that

14:38.380 --> 14:43.620
same game, and they're capturing and monitoring everything you do in that game, and then using

14:43.620 --> 14:48.780
that as a model to predict what you might need to do at the same exact moment. If they

14:48.780 --> 14:56.220
have the decision of say, 15,000 other players in that same exact moment of the game, and

14:56.220 --> 15:03.180
75% of them pushed X and looked up, they can probably pretty accurately predict that that's

15:03.180 --> 15:07.980
what you would do, and just do that move and stitch it all together.

15:07.980 --> 15:12.700
This is why I became a Stadia backer, because I think in a really kind of scary, creepy

15:12.700 --> 15:18.180
way, Google is the company that can figure this out. Between the network connectivity

15:18.180 --> 15:24.420
that they have, the hardware access that they have, and then this kind of stuff, I can actually

15:24.420 --> 15:29.580
see them pulling it off. We'll see. I have a lot of varying internet connections in which

15:29.580 --> 15:34.680
I can try this. I don't know how likely it is to work, but this is why I became whatever

15:34.680 --> 15:39.020
they call their backer, where you get the whole kit. I'm fascinated to see what they

15:39.020 --> 15:41.700
can pull off, and what it means for desktop Linux.

15:41.700 --> 15:47.140
Well, you have to assume that they won't open source any of the machine learning stuff that's

15:47.140 --> 15:52.380
required to do that, but it is all going to be running on a Linux backend, so we hopefully

15:52.380 --> 15:54.660
will get some of the benefits from it.

15:54.660 --> 15:58.420
Maybe I actually could see Google years down the road open sourcing it. They've kind of

15:58.420 --> 16:03.100
done that over time. They've implemented something, they've put it in production, they've gotten

16:03.100 --> 16:08.660
some benefit from it, they've trialed it or dog fooded it, and then released it. They

16:08.660 --> 16:12.260
just recently did that with a pretty sophisticated differential privacy library.

16:12.260 --> 16:17.060
Yeah, well, here's hoping, but speaking of things that you've spent or wasted your money

16:17.060 --> 16:22.740
on to see how it turns out, the Atari VCS is back in the news this week.

16:22.740 --> 16:29.260
Oh, it's too soon, Joe, too soon. I'm not quite as positive on the Atari VCS. Quick

16:29.260 --> 16:36.420
recap, Atari VCS is a retro-looking little Linux box that's going to have a custom Atari

16:36.420 --> 16:41.420
UI with an app store and some retro games, some modern games, and the promise to run

16:41.420 --> 16:49.140
your own OS. However, that promise looks a little more shaky as one of their key design

16:49.140 --> 16:54.380
contributors or a firm spilled the beans this week that things haven't been going so well.

16:54.380 --> 16:58.140
Yeah, they claim that they haven't been paid for six months and they've had enough and

16:58.140 --> 16:59.620
have quit the project.

16:59.620 --> 17:08.900
And that's after delay, after delay, after delay. But Atari does dispute this in sort

17:08.900 --> 17:13.160
of an indirect manner. They went to their blog and said, well, things are a little out

17:13.160 --> 17:16.660
of date with their information. We haven't worked with them for a while because we haven't

17:16.660 --> 17:21.180
paid them. And things are going really great. Everything's right on track. Don't worry about

17:21.180 --> 17:26.300
it at all. And by the way, the register, some of that is our IP, and we may ask you to take

17:26.300 --> 17:29.060
it down at any point. We reserve that right. Okay, thanks.

17:29.060 --> 17:33.660
Yeah, that register piece was a real deep dive and they spent two weeks investigating

17:33.660 --> 17:39.940
it and it looked pretty damning for the project. But then this Atari blog post kind of answers

17:39.940 --> 17:46.780
some of those questions, but then also kind of admits that it's nowhere near ready.

17:46.780 --> 17:53.340
Yeah, just about ready for production, though. That's the quote in the blog post. Just about,

17:53.340 --> 18:00.100
just real close. Yeah, this is rough because Atari as a company has the launch of this

18:00.100 --> 18:06.620
console listed as one of three major goals for the entire company.

18:06.620 --> 18:11.500
You talk about Atari like it's the same company as the 70s and 80s. But the reality is that

18:11.500 --> 18:16.620
it's just really the name and the trademarks that were just sort of sold. And now this

18:16.620 --> 18:21.820
company's got it. And yeah, they can call themselves Atari, but it's not the same company

18:21.820 --> 18:25.700
really. Yep. Perhaps that's why we are where we're

18:25.700 --> 18:28.060
at. Well, I couldn't help but bring this up just

18:28.060 --> 18:32.180
to troll you because I know that you are waiting for it. And I think you're going to be waiting

18:32.180 --> 18:37.140
for a very long time or you're going to get something that is a very nice looking little

18:37.140 --> 18:42.060
Linux box, which isn't massively expensive, but isn't going to do a huge amount.

18:42.060 --> 18:45.720
Yeah, unfortunately, like most of these things, it's going to not be very current either by

18:45.720 --> 18:51.580
the time it actually ships. But my end goal is that one day you can show up for a Linux

18:51.580 --> 18:56.420
fest and it'll be in the studio living room and ready to play.

18:56.420 --> 18:59.460
I think we'll still be using your Nvidia Shield for a while.

18:59.460 --> 19:03.060
Yeah, because then I'll be streaming games from Stadia on it. Of course.

19:03.060 --> 19:07.820
Yeah, and you'll be buying them with Open Libra, no doubt.

19:07.820 --> 19:12.140
Obviously, because this is a loose collective of individuals. Who else do I want backing

19:12.140 --> 19:18.060
my currency, Joe? Yeah, another loose collective of individuals.

19:18.060 --> 19:23.140
So this is essentially a fork of Facebook's Libra, which early in the week gained a lot

19:23.140 --> 19:28.140
of attention because it had a lot of claims. But then it turns out that a lot of the people

19:28.140 --> 19:33.300
who were supposed to be involved with it aren't really involved with it. And it's not really

19:33.300 --> 19:34.900
much more than a website.

19:34.900 --> 19:40.980
Oh, man, nothing else is more embarrassing than people pulling out at a rapid pace. And

19:40.980 --> 19:48.540
some of them with quotes like, I just showed up for a meeting. I was just present. I didn't

19:48.540 --> 19:54.580
mean to be on a slide that was given to a presentation. They have some great goals.

19:54.580 --> 19:58.820
They like the idea of the Libra currency, but they don't like the idea of it being tied

19:58.820 --> 20:07.080
with Facebook. All right, pretty understandable. I think the core issue that they miss is one

20:07.080 --> 20:11.860
that many of us, myself, all of us that are Linux geeks, make this mistake every now and

20:11.860 --> 20:18.100
then. And that is, sometimes we think something can be a success in the market based on its

20:18.100 --> 20:23.180
technical merits. And we forget that there's so many other factors at play in the market.

20:23.180 --> 20:30.580
So many other dynamics, as they like to say. And sometimes the worst product wins. I could

20:30.580 --> 20:34.260
make the cliche comparison of Betamax and VHS, but I think everybody gets what I'm talking

20:34.260 --> 20:40.180
about. Sometimes the worser tech wins out simply because it's some sort of market dynamic

20:40.180 --> 20:45.580
that makes it more available to consumers. And what they're attempting to solve here

20:45.580 --> 20:52.140
with a open Libra association, it's a great idea. From a technical standpoint, I totally

20:52.140 --> 20:58.740
follow it. But what Facebook is offering is corporate sponsorship, corporate backing,

20:58.740 --> 21:06.900
worldwide, new world corporate backing, nationless backing of a currency. And the whole central

21:06.900 --> 21:12.260
control and a business being behind it is what people will be drawn to. I'm not saying

21:12.260 --> 21:16.900
that's what appeals to me, but that's what makes Libra look interesting in comparison

21:16.900 --> 21:22.940
to things like Monero or Bitcoin or Ethereum. And so something like this that comes along,

21:22.940 --> 21:26.260
it's such a narrow view on the entire problem.

21:26.260 --> 21:30.500
Well, yeah. And apart from anything else, it's pretty much academic because Libra is

21:30.500 --> 21:35.380
going nowhere now that all of the payment providers have pulled out of it.

21:35.380 --> 21:41.260
Well, this is brutal. This is super brutal. Every US payment processor from PayPal to

21:41.260 --> 21:45.900
Stripe has pulled out of Facebook's Libra currency. That is devastating.

21:45.900 --> 21:51.500
Well, there's two reasons why this happens so quickly. One is pressure from regulators.

21:51.500 --> 21:56.300
And the other is that the first ever Libra council meeting is happening in Geneva on

21:56.300 --> 22:01.620
Monday the 14th, so the Monday that you're probably listening to this. And at that council

22:01.620 --> 22:06.500
meeting, that's where some firm commitments were going to have to be made. So it was kind

22:06.500 --> 22:12.980
of crunch time. It was either go all in or, as most of these payment processors have,

22:12.980 --> 22:13.980
just quit.

22:13.980 --> 22:18.860
Right. And it's pretty understandable for a payment processor in the US. There are very

22:18.860 --> 22:25.140
particular regulations that they are under, and the SEC loves to go after you if you violate

22:25.140 --> 22:30.260
those regulations. So it's pretty understandable why they would get sort of cold feet at this

22:30.260 --> 22:35.180
stage. Nothing says some of them couldn't go back in. If you look at that initial list,

22:35.180 --> 22:40.960
they were some of the heavy hitters. PayPal, Stripe, Visa, those are going to make a big

22:40.960 --> 22:43.300
difference in the potency of this currency.

22:43.300 --> 22:47.180
Yeah, Visa, MasterCard, and PayPal. Between the three of them, you can pretty much pay

22:47.180 --> 22:52.060
for anything anywhere in the world. And so it's going to be huge for Libra and therefore

22:52.060 --> 22:57.660
Facebook, whereas now the only organizations left are really sort of cryptocurrency people.

22:57.660 --> 23:04.620
Yeah. Well, and Spotify and Vodafone, they're in there too. But you're right, it really

23:04.620 --> 23:09.400
changes everything about this. And going back to Open Libra, there is one thing they touch

23:09.400 --> 23:14.660
on in their post on OpenLibra.io, which we have linked, that really kind of clicked with

23:14.660 --> 23:20.020
me. Quote, despite pushback from nation states, we believe that Facebook is likely to succeed

23:20.020 --> 23:25.140
in their goal. Governments will be focused on their own outcomes, and in reality have

23:25.140 --> 23:30.560
little legislative power to leverage against a transnational force such as Facebook Libra.

23:30.560 --> 23:36.180
For that reason, we are creating Open Libra. I don't think it has a snowball's chance,

23:36.180 --> 23:40.580
Joe. But you know, that part did kind of click with me. It does. It does seem like it's possible.

23:40.580 --> 23:45.940
Yeah, you never know. I was also very amused to hear that Facebook are being sued over

23:45.940 --> 23:52.540
the logo for Calibra, which is their wallet software. So not only did they pretty much

23:52.540 --> 23:58.900
steal the name from the ebook software, they also have got a logo that looks remarkably

23:58.900 --> 24:05.100
like the logo for Current, which is kind of one of these modern online bank things. But

24:05.100 --> 24:11.340
the twist in that story is it's the same design company who made both logos.

24:11.340 --> 24:16.420
That is good. My favorite cryptocurrency story was the bad news for Telegram. Remember we

24:16.420 --> 24:21.700
talked about Telegram's currency they were raising, and that if they hadn't reached their

24:21.700 --> 24:26.540
goal in time, they had to give the money back? Well, the SEC just poured cold water on that

24:26.540 --> 24:33.340
particular story. They said it's not happening in the US, and they have blocked their $1.7

24:33.340 --> 24:39.280
billion plan token sale. And this quote is pretty, pretty telling. It says, our emergency

24:39.280 --> 24:45.420
action today is intended to prevent Telegram from flooding the US market with digital tokens

24:45.420 --> 24:53.660
that we allege were unlawfully sold. That doesn't sound good for Telegram at all. I

24:53.660 --> 24:56.820
guess they're not going to become that big fancy crypto wallet after all.

24:56.820 --> 25:00.740
Well, no, it looks like they are going to have to pay back all the people who invested

25:00.740 --> 25:03.940
in it, which is going to be tricky for them.

25:03.940 --> 25:08.940
I don't know. I mean, God, it'd just be a shame if they just focused on messaging features.

25:08.940 --> 25:14.100
Wouldn't that be? What about presence awareness and D&D features? Oh, man, wouldn't that be

25:14.100 --> 25:18.820
a shame? That'd just be horrible. Man, if they want to make a buck, I'd pay for those

25:18.820 --> 25:23.220
features, tell you what. I just sort of feel like since they shifted gears and they started

25:23.220 --> 25:28.900
focusing on their cryptocurrency and their wallet and their identity stuff, the overall

25:28.900 --> 25:34.180
messaging features until just very recently have sort of suffered, especially in group

25:34.180 --> 25:40.720
chats where you have maybe close to 1,000, over 1,000 members, 1,000 plus. They've really

25:40.720 --> 25:46.300
failed to deliver on features that compete with things like Discord or even things like

25:46.300 --> 25:48.060
Slack and Rocket Chat.

25:48.060 --> 25:53.700
This cryptocurrency distraction reminds me of the mobile distraction that so many Linux

25:53.700 --> 25:54.940
companies get afflicted with.

25:54.940 --> 25:59.420
Well, yeah, and it was flavor of the month, wasn't it? When Bitcoin was at nearly $20,000

25:59.420 --> 26:05.100
and you have to assume that a lot of these cryptocurrency based plans were starting to

26:05.100 --> 26:11.620
be formed around then, they've taken a little while to get going. And now the kind of shine

26:11.620 --> 26:16.660
has come off cryptocurrencies. Blockchain as a fundamental technology is still doing

26:16.660 --> 26:21.900
relatively well. But I think that you're right. Yeah, it does feel very much like the mobile

26:21.900 --> 26:24.820
distraction that we had from the Linux companies.

26:24.820 --> 26:30.420
But in that time, the SEC and other U.S. government agencies have had time, like the IRS, have

26:30.420 --> 26:37.400
had time to learn about cryptocurrency and have a more aggressive approach now. It's

26:37.400 --> 26:43.320
less of a Wild West than it was even a year ago. And while they developed this product,

26:43.320 --> 26:47.740
the market has changed from right underneath them. And now they have a very aware government

26:47.740 --> 26:52.740
agency, which is ready to look into all of this. It really kind of, I don't know, if

26:52.740 --> 26:59.400
I was Telegram, I'd be worried. It's very possible that they could have to give that

26:59.400 --> 27:00.400
money back.

27:00.400 --> 27:04.900
