Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.560
This is episode 41, recorded on February 18, 2018.

00:20.560 --> 00:21.560
I'm Chris.

00:21.560 --> 00:22.560
And I'm John.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.560
Hello, Joe.

00:23.560 --> 00:26.800
It's good to be connected with you this week, and we start the week off with a bit of a

00:26.800 --> 00:34.640
celebrity project, D-Trace, the famous, world-famous D-Trace, has been relicensed as GPL version

00:34.640 --> 00:35.640
2.

00:35.640 --> 00:40.600
So hang on, this is Oracle dropping the CDDL and going to GPL?

00:40.600 --> 00:41.600
That can't be right.

00:41.600 --> 00:42.600
I know.

00:42.600 --> 00:43.600
Shocker, shocker.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.240
Well, in part, this has been in the works since August.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.880
So let's back up and talk about what D-Trace is.

00:48.880 --> 00:53.440
D-Trace is a really comprehensive tracing framework that was created by Sun Microsystems

00:53.440 --> 00:55.840
back in January of 2005.

00:55.840 --> 01:00.240
Now a tracing framework essentially allows a developer or administrator to watch everything

01:00.240 --> 01:05.520
an application does on a system from the application layer all the way down to the kernel.

01:05.520 --> 01:10.640
It can be used to get a global overview of a running system, such as the amount of memory

01:10.640 --> 01:15.360
or CPU or file system and network resources that an active process is taking.

01:15.360 --> 01:20.520
Extremely useful, but it's been rather closed off to Linux users for a long time.

01:20.520 --> 01:26.640
And Oracle is relicensing the bits that communicate with the kernel to GPL version 2.

01:26.640 --> 01:30.400
That doesn't mean the entire D-Trace stack is going to be GPL 2.

01:30.400 --> 01:35.640
In fact, some of the user bits are being relicensed to a totally new license, at least a new license

01:35.640 --> 01:42.760
to me, called the UPL, which is apparently the Universal Permissive License, which is

01:42.760 --> 01:45.100
compatible with the GPL version 2.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.100
Which is good enough, isn't it?

01:46.100 --> 01:51.000
At least it's not like the CDDL, which is incompatible with GPL, asterisk, not according

01:51.000 --> 01:52.640
to Canonical.

01:52.640 --> 01:55.560
But this is much more straightforward now.

01:55.560 --> 02:00.640
We're not going to have a problem with combining it with GPL software because it's completely

02:00.640 --> 02:02.880
permissive, that bit of it.

02:02.880 --> 02:08.400
And so this begs the question, if Oracle can do this for D-Trace, could they possibly do

02:08.400 --> 02:09.400
it for ZFS?

02:09.400 --> 02:11.680
I wonder about that myself.

02:11.680 --> 02:17.160
And there is a very interesting parallel here between ZFS and D-Trace.

02:17.160 --> 02:25.020
There is the Oracle D-Trace, and then there's Open D-Trace, which is a totally different

02:25.020 --> 02:28.320
project that's been going on for a while now.

02:28.320 --> 02:34.240
And just like with ZFS, there's Oracle ZFS, and then there's Open ZFS.

02:34.240 --> 02:40.400
Well, Open ZFS is nearly 50% new code from when they forked from Oracle.

02:40.400 --> 02:44.720
And so the question that's on my mind is what happens to both Open D-Trace and Open ZFS

02:44.720 --> 02:48.880
if Oracle does relicense at least their kernel bits to GPL, which it does seem they could

02:48.880 --> 02:49.880
do?

02:49.880 --> 02:51.960
This could be their GPL toe in the water, Joe.

02:51.960 --> 02:56.880
Well, let's hope so because it means that we can get things working on Linux without

02:56.880 --> 02:59.060
any question at all.

02:59.060 --> 03:04.360
As I said, we've got it on Ubuntu, but it would be nice for there to be no question

03:04.360 --> 03:06.400
mark as to whether that is allowed or not.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.760
Yeah, or put another way, maybe Ubuntu was right to ship it if they're eventually going

03:09.760 --> 03:11.580
to relicense anyways.

03:11.580 --> 03:12.580
Who knows?

03:12.580 --> 03:13.580
We'll just have to wait and see.

03:13.580 --> 03:15.040
A note back about D-Trace, though.

03:15.040 --> 03:18.800
So yeah, this started around August 1st of 2017, and they've been working towards it.

03:18.800 --> 03:24.460
But more recently, the D-Trace Linux kernel Git repository went live with D-Trace commits

03:24.460 --> 03:28.620
that have been re-based on top of recent upstream Linux kernel builds.

03:28.620 --> 03:33.240
So we may see this submitted upstream to the main Linux kernel, and it just could be something

03:33.240 --> 03:36.560
that we get as Linux users in short order.

03:36.560 --> 03:41.680
Yeah, hopefully, but from potentially good news to potentially bad news, and that is

03:41.680 --> 03:48.920
that Mozilla are adding sponsored stories to the Firefox new tab page, which has come

03:48.920 --> 03:52.120
from their Pocket integration.

03:52.120 --> 03:57.200
And from what I have seen of people's comments on this, this is just Mozilla moving in the

03:57.200 --> 03:58.960
wrong direction.

03:58.960 --> 04:02.080
What don't people freak out about Mozilla these days?

04:02.080 --> 04:05.360
When Pocket got shipped, it was a huge controversy.

04:05.360 --> 04:09.280
I still remember people being upset about Pocket, and as somebody who switched to Firefox

04:09.280 --> 04:13.160
after version 57 again, Pocket's one of my favorite features.

04:13.160 --> 04:17.360
And I got to admit something else, been using the new tab page, been using the recommendations

04:17.360 --> 04:21.920
on the new tab page when I want a nice, relaxing read in the afternoon or the evening.

04:21.920 --> 04:26.520
And while I'm not a huge fan of ads in my browser, if they do them right and it gives

04:26.520 --> 04:31.400
them a sustainable revenue stream that isn't the teat of Google, then I'm actually a fan

04:31.400 --> 04:32.400
of it.

04:32.400 --> 04:34.280
I'm not a huge fan of it, but I'm a fan of it.

04:34.280 --> 04:37.480
Well, that's kind of part of what they said when they announced this, that they want to

04:37.480 --> 04:42.400
have relevant adverts that are not just clickbaiting nonsense.

04:42.400 --> 04:47.000
And as you have proven, you're already finding it useful.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.840
And they do have to fund it somehow.

04:48.840 --> 04:52.720
And if that means that potentially moving away from the Googled money, which let's face

04:52.720 --> 04:54.800
it, that will dry up eventually, won't it?

04:54.800 --> 05:01.260
When crime just completely dominates as it basically already has, then they're going

05:01.260 --> 05:02.680
to need a new revenue stream.

05:02.680 --> 05:08.600
And this, I suppose, is less offensive than some of the ones, but just coming off the

05:08.600 --> 05:14.800
back of this Mr. Robot thing, it's just not the time, well, I suppose when is the time

05:14.800 --> 05:20.040
to announce new things like this, but it's just going to rub people the wrong way.

05:20.040 --> 05:23.760
And people don't want this from an open source browser.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.080
And you're saying Pocket's useful.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.640
I use Pocket all the time.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.240
They did promise to open source it.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.240
That was a long time ago.

05:29.240 --> 05:32.040
There's been a Git repository, there's not much happening there.

05:32.040 --> 05:35.840
They certainly not announced anything about running your own server.

05:35.840 --> 05:41.880
They just seem to be too much like the competition that they're not differentiating themselves

05:41.880 --> 05:43.560
in necessarily the right ways.

05:43.560 --> 05:48.080
And the right ways would be to be totally open source, not have these weird proprietary

05:48.080 --> 05:54.040
add ons thrust at you and to not be all about marketing and commercialization.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.040
Fair enough.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.040
I think those are all good points, Joe.

05:56.040 --> 06:01.680
The more you and I talk about Mozilla on this show, I realize they really suck at communicating.

06:01.680 --> 06:08.320
They communicate as if they were an offshoot of the Internet Explorer Department at Microsoft

06:08.320 --> 06:12.440
from the 90s and then they became a large company and all of a sudden they had to communicate

06:12.440 --> 06:13.520
with the world.

06:13.520 --> 06:19.580
If they came out and they communicated more effectively, I think people would be on board.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.580
How have they communicated?

06:20.580 --> 06:22.520
Well, here's an example.

06:22.520 --> 06:26.680
The reason for doing this is because they believe they can create a platform that supports

06:26.680 --> 06:31.960
high quality content that respects users' privacy and that puts control back into the

06:31.960 --> 06:34.080
hands of users.

06:34.080 --> 06:37.640
And they're going to do so in a way that is financially sustainable for the future health

06:37.640 --> 06:38.960
of the web.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.160
So they're going to explore the ways to do this.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.960
Now, what are they saying there?

06:43.960 --> 06:46.840
It sounds like they want to build a platform, it sounds like they want to create lock-in,

06:46.840 --> 06:50.680
it sounds like they want to generate revenue and have hand selected content.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.600
Those things all sound bad.

06:52.600 --> 06:57.940
But what I believe the intention behind that paragraph is we want to find a sustainable

06:57.940 --> 07:03.520
funding model so that way we can keep fighting for the free web because if we go down, then

07:03.520 --> 07:07.440
it's Microsoft and Google and a little bit of Apple that are going to run this whole

07:07.440 --> 07:08.620
show.

07:08.620 --> 07:12.640
And so we're trying to come up with a way to make money that still respects privacy,

07:12.640 --> 07:17.480
that can be done in a classy way, that takes lessons learned from the rest of the web and

07:17.480 --> 07:22.840
how we've tried to monetize, we being the internet, have tried to monetize ads on the

07:22.840 --> 07:23.840
web for all of these years.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.800
We're going to look at those lessons, we're going to take those lessons in and we're going

07:26.800 --> 07:30.660
to implement something that's better so that way we can stop taking money from companies

07:30.660 --> 07:34.020
like Yahoo and Google but keep fighting for a free web.

07:34.020 --> 07:37.940
And if they literally said it like that, I don't think there would be any question about

07:37.940 --> 07:40.760
why they're doing this, I don't think there would be any problem.

07:40.760 --> 07:45.500
But because they speak like there's some sort of offshoot from the Internet Explorer Department

07:45.500 --> 07:49.800
from the 1990s, they come across like bureaucrats.

07:49.800 --> 07:53.600
And we don't trust bureaucrats anymore, we as in people of the Internet.

07:53.600 --> 07:59.440
And when they start talking about platforms and high quality content and financially sustainable,

07:59.440 --> 08:03.760
it comes across like a bunch of bureaucrats that are trying to figure out their next revenue

08:03.760 --> 08:04.760
grab.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.880
Yeah, I can't argue with any of that, man.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.440
It's just communication issues.

08:08.440 --> 08:11.060
Yeah, I think here's what I've decided to do now.

08:11.060 --> 08:17.040
In light of the way I now look at Mozilla is I just have to go by their actions.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.040
I do like how they're rolling this out.

08:19.040 --> 08:22.540
So first of all, they're only going to do this in the US to start with.

08:22.540 --> 08:25.680
So if you're outside the US, you're not even going to see this for a while.

08:25.680 --> 08:30.180
It's only going to be in a certain small portion of the US user base.

08:30.180 --> 08:35.100
And it's only on the new tabs page where they're going to have recommendations from pocket,

08:35.100 --> 08:40.200
places you've been to recently, and one of their handpicked sponsored posts.

08:40.200 --> 08:44.180
See that's a totally different thing than something like Google ads where it's a bunch

08:44.180 --> 08:49.880
of machines that are just choosing the ads based on random auctions and then just putting

08:49.880 --> 08:52.840
up something based on keywords that they think is right.

08:52.840 --> 08:56.680
This is going to be something in theory that somebody who's been charged with a job at

08:56.680 --> 09:03.260
Mozilla is going to be handpicking and putting a tile on a small sub portion of the US user

09:03.260 --> 09:05.520
base of Firefox.

09:05.520 --> 09:07.840
And that's how this is starting.

09:07.840 --> 09:09.640
Those actions I completely agree with.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.660
That seems reasonable and like a good way to roll this out.

09:12.660 --> 09:18.120
And I'm also totally in support of them coming up with revenue models outside of their existing

09:18.120 --> 09:19.120
ones.

09:19.120 --> 09:23.360
It's just how they've talked about it, how they kind of slip it in, and the way that

09:23.360 --> 09:25.880
this whole pocket thing has been received to begin with.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.800
I think if this whole pocket controversy had been communicated properly from the beginning,

09:29.800 --> 09:34.680
we wouldn't be still experiencing the ripples of people's dissatisfaction with that pocket

09:34.680 --> 09:35.680
transaction.

09:35.680 --> 09:41.920
Yeah, well, Google are also kind of guilty of miscommunicating when it comes to AMP accelerated

09:41.920 --> 09:44.080
mobile pages.

09:44.080 --> 09:48.560
People have long since said it's disingenuous of them to claim that the idea is to make

09:48.560 --> 09:53.880
the web more open and faster for everyone.

09:53.880 --> 09:57.240
And we talked about that previously, but this week they've come out with AMP Stories and

09:57.240 --> 10:02.440
AMP for Email, which pretty much backs up that it's not about the open web.

10:02.440 --> 10:06.960
It's about Google wanting to dominate with things that they've come up with themselves.

10:06.960 --> 10:10.200
That's a really strong opening statement, but I can't disagree.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.880
The part that is the most offensive about this news today that I'm going to explain

10:13.880 --> 10:19.360
is the part that I was actually very dismissive at first, because when I hear something that's

10:19.360 --> 10:22.540
Snapchat-like stories, I have this mechanism in my brain.

10:22.540 --> 10:26.000
It's kind of like the cloud to bud extension for a lot of people's browsers, it just muted

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
immediately.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
Oh, Snapchat?

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
I tune it out.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.560
This is actually very insidious, though, and I can see why big organizations are going

10:33.560 --> 10:35.080
to gobble this up.

10:35.080 --> 10:43.200
In Google's failure to get buzz and failure to have Google Plus and even Wave take hold,

10:43.200 --> 10:47.520
they've realized where their strengths lie, email and search.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.520
That is their power zone.

10:49.520 --> 10:53.860
So why not introduce social-like features to these platforms?

10:53.860 --> 11:00.720
So AMP Stories is going to bring visual interactive elements to Google Search, just like Snapchat

11:00.720 --> 11:04.840
Stories, with visually rich storytelling, Google says.

11:04.840 --> 11:09.680
And of course, it's all powered using AMP, it's cross-platform, and it'll be right there

11:09.680 --> 11:10.840
in the search results.

11:10.840 --> 11:15.680
Where the knowledge cards are today, there's now going to be interactive visual stories,

11:15.680 --> 11:20.840
and all the publisher has to do is just turn a few extra features on on their publishing

11:20.840 --> 11:24.400
platform, install a few Google plug-ins, and they can start publishing these interactive

11:24.400 --> 11:27.360
stories right to Google Search results.

11:27.360 --> 11:31.840
Google is saying, ah, we don't need our own social network, we own Search with this move.

11:31.840 --> 11:36.340
But am I just radically out of touch here, or does this sound like a terrible idea, both

11:36.340 --> 11:38.580
stories and email?

11:38.580 --> 11:43.280
I don't want extra stuff added to these things.

11:43.280 --> 11:48.520
And the idea of animated graphics and stuff happening in Search, I can't help but feel

11:48.520 --> 11:53.400
that if this takes off, then 10 years down the line, we're going to look back on it the

11:53.400 --> 11:59.640
same way we looked at Blink and Marquee in the early websites and animated GIFs and stuff.

11:59.640 --> 12:02.160
It just is naff and just not what we need.

12:02.160 --> 12:06.500
We want simplicity, not trying to make it fancy for its own sake.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.720
So let's talk about the email part.

12:07.720 --> 12:13.200
So yeah, they're also announcing AMP for Gmail, starting with Gmail developer previews of

12:13.200 --> 12:15.840
AMP, which is available today.

12:15.840 --> 12:20.440
These new features will allow users to perform simple tasks, such as booking calendar appointments,

12:20.440 --> 12:24.560
checking into flights, all directly within an email using AMP for Email.

12:24.560 --> 12:28.160
Yeah, you said AMP for Gmail originally there, which is what this actually is.

12:28.160 --> 12:32.480
And yet they're calling it AMP for Email to try and suggest that it's for the open web,

12:32.480 --> 12:33.600
it's for anyone to use.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.760
But who else is actually going to use it?

12:35.760 --> 12:36.760
Exactly.

12:36.760 --> 12:43.080
Both AMP for the web and now AMP Stories and AMP for Email are solving problems that should

12:43.080 --> 12:44.880
be solved in different ways.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.960
And they're consolidating this all onto Google services.

12:47.960 --> 12:51.240
I think Google realized that when they couldn't build their own social network, they just

12:51.240 --> 12:52.720
needed to own the entire web.

12:52.720 --> 12:55.760
So they're making a hard play with Chrome right now, and they're eating up market share

12:55.760 --> 12:57.120
like a madman.

12:57.120 --> 13:01.060
They're rolling out AMP, iterating on that, and they're not slowing down.

13:01.060 --> 13:06.240
And then now you combine that with their new annoying ad blocking, quote unquote, they're

13:06.240 --> 13:10.880
baking into Chrome where Google, who makes all of their money from selling ads, is going

13:10.880 --> 13:16.120
to determine what ads people should be able to see in the world's most popular browser.

13:16.120 --> 13:21.380
And now in the world's most popular search, if you use their AMP technology, you can give

13:21.380 --> 13:26.560
users a very special experience that they'll only see on Google search.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.800
And it works best in Google Chrome.

13:28.800 --> 13:29.800
Obviously.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.600
Yeah, it's just them wanting to completely dominate.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.480
And can you really blame them?

13:34.480 --> 13:39.440
That's what a business's whole job is to do, is to dominate a market.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.720
And for us to complain about that is just ridiculous.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.880
That's what they should be doing.

13:44.880 --> 13:45.880
That's their job.

13:45.880 --> 13:46.880
I agree.

13:46.880 --> 13:50.480
Well, going back to our Mozilla discussion, Mozilla could be hammering these points.

13:50.480 --> 13:55.520
I suspect, and who knows, this is total rampant speculation, but perhaps the financial agreement

13:55.520 --> 14:00.400
with Google is too great to come directly out and hit these points hard.

14:00.400 --> 14:05.240
But we do need a Batman to swoop in with a cape on and save us from this particular problem.

14:05.240 --> 14:12.360
Mozilla could be that Batman, and yet they can't communicate it clearly.

14:12.360 --> 14:13.360
Last.ting.com.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.240
It's a smarter way to do mobile.

14:15.240 --> 14:19.680
And the average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.520
It's pay for what you use wireless.

14:21.520 --> 14:26.480
So you pay for your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes, and then $6 for the line

14:26.480 --> 14:27.480
itself.

14:27.480 --> 14:28.480
That's it.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.480
Well, then Uncle Sam's tax.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.480
That's it right there.

14:30.480 --> 14:31.480
$6 for a line.

14:31.480 --> 14:37.520
And then your usage, nationwide coverage, CDMA and GSM, no contracts, no quote unquote

14:37.520 --> 14:39.640
commitments or service agreements.

14:39.640 --> 14:44.400
And then, I don't know what, maybe it's just me, but all our sponsors have the best dashboards.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.700
And Ting, nobody beats Ting's dashboard in the mobile industry.

14:47.700 --> 14:48.700
Go check it out.

14:48.700 --> 14:49.700
Last.ting.com.

14:49.700 --> 14:50.700
Support the show.

14:50.700 --> 14:55.000
Get $25 in service credit if you bring a device, because remember, I did mention they support

14:55.000 --> 14:59.060
CDMA and GSM, which means there's lots of devices you can bring.

14:59.060 --> 15:03.120
They have a BYOD page, and there's lots of devices you can choose from.

15:03.120 --> 15:07.100
If you want to buy one brand new, I'm going to give a quick recommendation for the Moto

15:07.100 --> 15:09.000
G5s Plus.

15:09.000 --> 15:13.400
$254 when you go to last.ting.com, you own it outright.

15:13.400 --> 15:16.380
No payments, no contract, nothing.

15:16.380 --> 15:18.960
You own the device like you own your computer.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.540
And it has CDMA and GSM support.

15:21.540 --> 15:26.360
It has 32 gigs of built-in storage, but micro SD can go up to 128 gigs.

15:26.360 --> 15:30.320
And my favorite feature, the Motorola's have the turbo power charging.

15:30.320 --> 15:34.320
You can get six hours of battery life in 15 minutes of charging.

15:34.320 --> 15:41.700
It also runs Android 8.0, so it's a good future phone as well for $254.

15:41.700 --> 15:46.400
The Moto G5s Plus and many others are at Ting, last.ting.com.

15:46.400 --> 15:55.500
Okay, let's talk about Ubuntu and a bit of drama that came out this week from a seemingly

15:55.500 --> 16:00.040
innocuous mailing list post by Will Cook.

16:00.040 --> 16:05.000
It caused a massive storm on Reddit and all over, really.

16:05.000 --> 16:10.600
And it all boils down to they want to collect some data on their user base.

16:10.600 --> 16:15.400
And so there's no way that this could possibly be anything but evil and them spying on their

16:15.400 --> 16:16.400
users, right?

16:16.400 --> 16:20.160
Well, I think it's clear that they want to know exactly where every single Ubuntu user

16:20.160 --> 16:25.720
lives down to the room and maybe perhaps even grab screenshots of their computing sessions,

16:25.720 --> 16:26.720
right?

16:26.720 --> 16:27.720
That's what came out of this announcement?

16:27.720 --> 16:32.240
Yeah, and their webcams and stuff.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.840
I understand people are concerned about this kind of stuff.

16:34.840 --> 16:37.400
And yes, it would be checked on by default.

16:37.400 --> 16:41.220
But the way they're talking about this is it would be in the installer.

16:41.220 --> 16:44.000
So it would be an install option.

16:44.000 --> 16:47.960
And you know, I hope they picked the right verbiage here.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.720
Learn from our friends at Mozilla.

16:49.720 --> 16:54.680
Make sure you communicate clearly that this is going to be a one time shot of information

16:54.680 --> 16:56.200
after install.

16:56.200 --> 16:59.400
Once the networking comes online, they're going to upload the information.

16:59.400 --> 17:04.280
And then there's popcorn, which remains active in the background, which would report periodically

17:04.280 --> 17:06.080
about the packages you install.

17:06.080 --> 17:08.020
And then there's crash reporting software.

17:08.020 --> 17:12.660
So we're not talking telemetry from Windows 10 here, where it's everything you do is being

17:12.660 --> 17:15.760
submitted back to Microsoft on an ongoing basis.

17:15.760 --> 17:18.700
We're really talking about one big shot after you install.

17:18.700 --> 17:22.520
So that way, they get an idea if you have a trackpad and the kind of Wi-Fi that you

17:22.520 --> 17:23.520
have.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.280
And they're pretty clear about what they would look at.

17:25.280 --> 17:31.920
The CPU family, disk sizes, GPU, OEM vendor, if you have Livepatch turned on, the disk

17:31.920 --> 17:34.000
layout that you've chosen.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.360
I think all of these things would help them make a better product.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.560
So it makes sense why they would want this information.

17:39.560 --> 17:43.480
I'd like to hear what you think, because I definitely have a couple of concerns.

17:43.480 --> 17:47.080
A couple of red lights are flashing pretty rapidly in my brain right now.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.500
And I don't know, I'd kind of like to know what you think.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.960
I hate to sit on the fence, but that's where I am on this.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.240
I haven't made up my mind yet.

17:55.240 --> 18:00.360
Because on the one hand, it is incredibly useful information that they can make the

18:00.360 --> 18:02.120
product better with.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.640
And it's going to benefit the users.

18:04.640 --> 18:10.480
But on the other hand, it feels that they have to do it really, really well, otherwise

18:10.480 --> 18:12.560
it could go horribly wrong.

18:12.560 --> 18:16.600
Because he's talking about, in this mailing list post, publishing this data as well in

18:16.600 --> 18:21.840
an anonymized format, which is essentially statistics, which is useful.

18:21.840 --> 18:28.280
I would love to know what OEMs people are using and a bunch of that stuff, and how modern

18:28.280 --> 18:32.080
CPUs people are using statistically.

18:32.080 --> 18:38.200
But the thing is, although, yes, he's talking about the information being sent over HTTPS,

18:38.200 --> 18:45.840
what I would really love to see is them open source exactly what's at their end of this.

18:45.840 --> 18:50.840
And obviously, everything at our end is open source anyway, send it over a secure connection.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.760
And then really, people can't complain, can they?

18:52.760 --> 18:56.220
If they know exactly what's happening with this data and how it's being sent and how

18:56.220 --> 18:57.220
it's being collected.

18:57.220 --> 19:04.200
But I just fear that if they bungle even one slight part of that, it could go horribly

19:04.200 --> 19:05.200
wrong.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.960
I think the number one thing I do like about this is that they're going to make the data

19:08.960 --> 19:09.960
public.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.040
That could be fascinating for a lot of people.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.040
And you are so right.

19:13.040 --> 19:16.480
If they were open sourcing this, where it was something that other distributions could

19:16.480 --> 19:22.160
even jump in on and use, that would be really valuable, or at least self-host.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.640
The other thing I'll say that would make me feel a lot more comfortable about this, and

19:25.640 --> 19:33.680
they're discussing this right now, is a really clear checkbox to opt out later on after install.

19:33.680 --> 19:37.520
Because I have several questions about this, and making a clear, easy place for somebody

19:37.520 --> 19:42.200
to go, like in the privacy section of GNOME settings to turn this off, would be a slam

19:42.200 --> 19:43.200
dunk.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.880
Because how does this work for OEMs?

19:44.880 --> 19:50.520
If I buy an Ubuntu laptop from Dell, and they install it for me, are they checking that

19:50.520 --> 19:51.520
box?

19:51.520 --> 19:52.520
I would assume it would be a policy.

19:52.520 --> 19:56.800
And because Canonical is one of their trusted partners, they would probably turn it on by

19:56.800 --> 19:57.800
default.

19:57.800 --> 20:02.400
So I would like to have a checkbox in GNOME settings to turn it the hell off if I didn't

20:02.400 --> 20:03.400
like it.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.600
Personally, I'd actually probably leave it on.

20:05.600 --> 20:10.000
And then the other thing I have to wonder about is how does this affect downstream distributions,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.720
like Elementary OS or Ubuntu MATE?

20:13.720 --> 20:17.000
How will they be impacted by this code upstream?

20:17.000 --> 20:21.800
And it's even more interesting for distributions like Pop OS and Elementary OS that might not

20:21.800 --> 20:23.720
be using the Ubiquiti installer.

20:23.720 --> 20:27.840
Well, yeah, that is a big question about the downstream distros, and they need to work

20:27.840 --> 20:32.800
with them, essentially, or at least make it really easy for them to either disable this

20:32.800 --> 20:35.400
or enable it, depending on what they want to do.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.880
And the flavors like Ubuntu MATE, well, they're using Ubiquiti.

20:38.880 --> 20:43.560
So the question is, is it something that they're going to have to integrate into their control

20:43.560 --> 20:48.560
panel or settings menu somewhere to disable it afterwards?

20:48.560 --> 20:50.480
There's a lot of questions here.

20:50.480 --> 20:54.760
And I suppose that's the point of proposing this on an open mailing list where everyone

20:54.760 --> 20:56.440
can have their say.

20:56.440 --> 21:02.560
But I asked Poppy about when Will is planning to implement this or thinking about implementing

21:02.560 --> 21:07.680
this, and it is in 1804, which is in a couple of months' time.

21:07.680 --> 21:12.880
Which seems like an awfully short period of time to be thinking about this.

21:12.880 --> 21:15.320
But 1804 is going to be a huge release for them.

21:15.320 --> 21:18.080
It's going to have a lot of users, and there's a lot of valuable data there.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.160
So you can see why they want to put this in there.

21:20.160 --> 21:25.480
But is that enough time for all the flavors and downstream projects to be consulted and

21:25.480 --> 21:26.480
have their say?

21:26.480 --> 21:27.480
I suspect not.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.920
Yeah, you nailed my main concern right there.

21:29.920 --> 21:34.440
That's what I've kind of been biting my tongue about is it feels too soon for 1804, but I

21:34.440 --> 21:38.760
totally understand why you would want 1804 because for the next five years, that's going

21:38.760 --> 21:40.000
to have...

21:40.000 --> 21:44.920
And I know because I went to the Ubuntu rally, and Mark Shuttleworth talked about in one

21:44.920 --> 21:53.480
of his keynotes that the LTS has a ginormous larger user base than all of the other intermediate

21:53.480 --> 21:54.480
releases.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.520
People do jump from LTS to LTS.

21:57.520 --> 22:00.800
1710 bucks the trend a little bit because it's so different.

22:00.800 --> 22:06.500
But if you take 1710 out of the data, the LTSs can be as much as 20x users compared

22:06.500 --> 22:08.720
to the intermediate releases.

22:08.720 --> 22:13.040
And so there's a huge incentive to try to collect as much data as possible because those

22:13.040 --> 22:14.600
are the releases that really matter.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.920
I totally understand that.

22:15.920 --> 22:18.840
I realize those are the dynamics that they're working with.

22:18.840 --> 22:24.680
At the same time, 1804 comes out in April, and they are talking about building a back-end

22:24.680 --> 22:30.480
infrastructure to store all of this information securely and privately.

22:30.480 --> 22:34.440
That feels like that's a year-long project just in the design and building and testing

22:34.440 --> 22:35.440
phase.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.440
I don't know.

22:36.440 --> 22:37.440
Not necessarily.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.440
I think it is.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.440
Absolutely.

22:39.440 --> 22:42.360
Because you've got to test data leakage from the client side, transmitting it up to the

22:42.360 --> 22:43.360
server.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.840
You've got to make sure that nobody in the middle can figure out who's talking to the

22:45.840 --> 22:48.480
server by getting involved in the session.

22:48.480 --> 22:52.140
There's all kinds of things you discover when you take a data set and you make it public.

22:52.140 --> 22:56.200
People have been often shocked how people can wheel down who is who.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.560
It is really particular information.

22:58.560 --> 23:03.680
It's your hardware, it's a vague area of where you're at, it's your versioning.

23:03.680 --> 23:08.080
There's more and more layers to this that you can use to whittle down who an exact person

23:08.080 --> 23:09.240
is.

23:09.240 --> 23:11.880
There should be some public testing of that data first.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.240
It should really start with a small subset.

23:14.240 --> 23:17.600
Maybe it should have already been beta tested in 1710 at this point.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.600
People should be reporting on it, and we should be finding these bugs out.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.720
We should be discovering that things aren't working quite right.

23:23.720 --> 23:29.520
This could be me channeling a little bit of fear from the way that the Unity Dash search

23:29.520 --> 23:30.520
was rolled out.

23:30.520 --> 23:35.120
I hate to draw a parallel here because they are not the same things, but Unity Dash search

23:35.120 --> 23:39.600
came out, I think it was in 1204, mid-cycle.

23:39.600 --> 23:45.400
It was one of the quote-unquote surprise features of 1204, and it very quickly was discovered

23:45.400 --> 23:49.640
that it wasn't encrypting the data correctly, it wasn't storing the information correctly.

23:49.640 --> 23:54.420
There was a lot of little small things that weren't major issues to fix, but didn't get

23:54.420 --> 23:57.480
discovered until a lot of people were using the software.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.040
Yeah, but come on, it's a checkbox.

24:00.040 --> 24:03.160
It might be on by default, and most people might stick to defaults, but all you have

24:03.160 --> 24:05.640
to do is just uncheck that, problem solved.

24:05.640 --> 24:06.800
Yeah, okay.

24:06.800 --> 24:07.800
You know what though?

24:07.800 --> 24:12.160
If you go search Google today, you will still see people writing articles about the Unity

24:12.160 --> 24:13.720
spyware.

24:13.720 --> 24:19.160
That was true with the Amazon affiliate search stuff, and it still branded them badly.

24:19.160 --> 24:24.680
If it was me, Joe, if I was shipping this, I would take it a little bit safe.

24:24.680 --> 24:29.240
I would include the checkbox with all of the same information and the full disclaimer about

24:29.240 --> 24:33.160
the types of information that would be collected, but I would start small.

24:33.160 --> 24:38.800
And then over 1804's life cycle via updates, I would increase the functionality of what

24:38.800 --> 24:44.240
that thing collects, and how it collects it, and how we store it as it evolves.

24:44.240 --> 24:49.840
That you start small, you ship a minimum viable product, and you get the user consent upfront

24:49.840 --> 24:54.920
during installation of 1804, and then you iterate on it over the life cycle of 1804

24:54.920 --> 24:58.720
and make it more complete, and then you have time to build it properly.

24:58.720 --> 24:59.720
This is all new.

24:59.720 --> 25:03.200
We're learning about it this week, and those are my initial concerns.

25:03.200 --> 25:06.860
Thinking about it though, I could totally see how it helps them make a better product.

25:06.860 --> 25:09.840
If they have an idea that a lot of people are using a certain set of applications, then

25:09.840 --> 25:15.720
they can focus on that security-wise and feature-wise, trackpads, Wi-Fi chips, GPUs, et cetera.

25:15.720 --> 25:19.600
It is a necessary function for them to make a better desktop, and I'm going to turn it

25:19.600 --> 25:22.840
on on my systems, and I'm just having a lot of faith that they'll work these things out

25:22.840 --> 25:25.920
because I am concerned that they're rushing this whole thing.

25:25.920 --> 25:30.000
Well, one of the data points that they will no doubt be collecting is whether or not you're

25:30.000 --> 25:32.760
using the minimal install option in 1804.

25:32.760 --> 25:36.800
And this is going to be another checkbox in Ubiquiti, which is going to allow you to install

25:36.800 --> 25:40.080
Ubuntu but without loads of packages.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.640
It's pretty much just going to be GNOME and a web browser, and that's it, so not even

25:43.640 --> 25:46.480
an email client and no torrent client, that sort of thing.

25:46.480 --> 25:52.840
Yeah, not to be confused with the mini ISO, like Joe said, it's just a checkbox, and probably

25:52.840 --> 25:53.840
the one I'll be using.

25:53.840 --> 25:57.240
I don't need Thunderbird or Rhythmbox or Cheese or Shotwell.

25:57.240 --> 25:58.240
I think I'm going to use this.

25:58.240 --> 26:02.240
Yeah, it's certainly what I would use if I was going to install the main Ubuntu.

26:02.240 --> 26:07.160
Ubuntu have been offering a separate ISO for this for a while, but I think it's just a

26:07.160 --> 26:08.280
much more sensible thing.

26:08.280 --> 26:12.240
Why not just bake it into the installer instead of having to have a totally separate ISO?

26:12.240 --> 26:14.080
So yeah, this is a great move from them.

26:14.080 --> 26:20.040
Well, speaking of Ubuntu, if the dream of using your phone as the one device, the convergence

26:20.040 --> 26:24.320
device, if you will, then the Linux on Galaxy project has probably gotten your attention.

26:24.320 --> 26:28.800
We've talked about it before on the show, and there's been a bit of movement on Samsung's

26:28.800 --> 26:29.800
part this week.

26:29.800 --> 26:34.120
Yeah, now they're calling it Linux on DEX, D-E-X, which is the hardware that you need

26:34.120 --> 26:38.040
to use it, but there still seems to be a bit of confusion about the branding.

26:38.040 --> 26:43.200
But anyway, they've come out with a survey, and this is to try and ascertain exactly

26:43.200 --> 26:46.480
what people want from this.

26:46.480 --> 26:50.120
And as I always say with these surveys, if you don't take part in them and don't give

26:50.120 --> 26:54.040
them the data that they need to make the decisions, then don't go complaining when the actual

26:54.040 --> 26:55.040
thing comes out.

26:55.040 --> 27:00.400
And they ask you a whole bunch of stuff about whether you're a current Linux user and what

27:00.400 --> 27:02.160
distro and stuff you use.

27:02.160 --> 27:06.600
And also, I think the key question, one of the last ones is, would you be willing to

27:06.600 --> 27:08.400
pay for this?

27:08.400 --> 27:12.320
And I don't think many people are going to say yes to that, but you never know.

27:12.320 --> 27:15.820
They have to make money somehow, even if it's not just on the hardware, because there's

27:15.820 --> 27:18.160
a lot of software support, isn't there?

27:18.160 --> 27:21.840
It's not like the phones where they just push a few OTAs and then abandon it.

27:21.840 --> 27:27.520
They're going to have to, I think, to make this secure, do a lot of development work.

27:27.520 --> 27:30.720
So they're probably going to have to have a revenue stream in there.

27:30.720 --> 27:34.080
And so it's probably going to be some sort of subscription model, although I'm hoping

27:34.080 --> 27:39.920
that people will hack it and make it run lineage and totally open source software.

27:39.920 --> 27:40.920
Yeah, interesting.

27:40.920 --> 27:46.600
If you say you're willing to pay for Linux in the survey, they then ask you a 13th question,

27:46.600 --> 27:49.880
and that is, how much money would you be willing to pay?

27:49.880 --> 27:53.920
Well, you can see what I answered to that question then.

27:53.920 --> 27:54.920
Did you say no?

27:54.920 --> 27:55.920
Of course.

27:55.920 --> 27:56.920
Yeah, I can take you said no.

27:56.920 --> 27:57.920
Mm-hmm.

27:57.920 --> 28:03.640
Well, they ask you, would you be willing to pay $0 to $10, $10 to $50, $50 to $100, or

28:03.640 --> 28:07.200
over $100, money does not matter.

28:07.200 --> 28:12.400
I'm going to, you know what, just to skew the results, I'm going to answer that one.

28:12.400 --> 28:17.240
But when I think about it, I'm not sure if I would be willing, if I've got to drop $1,000

28:17.240 --> 28:23.000
on a phone, and I've got to drop $150 on a Dex doc, and let's be honest, to make that

28:23.000 --> 28:28.760
work, I probably need at least one or two, because you have to have the Dex doc to invoke

28:28.760 --> 28:30.360
this Linux desktop.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.880
So you're going to want that at home and at work, or you're going to want that at a couple

28:32.880 --> 28:35.600
of stations, otherwise, what's the point?

28:35.600 --> 28:42.080
So it is getting kind of expensive to then buy Linux access on top of that, especially

28:42.080 --> 28:47.520
if they end up using something that is just inherently available via kernel features.

28:47.520 --> 28:50.680
That gets a little harder to justify paying a lot of money for.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.800
They'd have to really nail the experience.

28:52.800 --> 28:56.680
And then I'd probably be willing to do it.

28:56.680 --> 29:00.000
But something tells me they would try to sell it through some sort of weird Samsung store

29:00.000 --> 29:01.600
and not the Play Store.

29:01.600 --> 29:02.600
Yeah.

29:02.600 --> 29:07.840
I think if it was a subscription model of, I don't know, $5 a month maybe, it might gain

29:07.840 --> 29:12.360
some traction in enterprise, but I think it all depends on what that experience is actually

29:12.360 --> 29:13.360
going to be like.

29:13.360 --> 29:16.120
Is it going to be good enough for developers and stuff?

29:16.120 --> 29:21.040
Because I can't see normal people using this, people who would use Windows normally switching

29:21.040 --> 29:22.880
to Linux because it's available on this.

29:22.880 --> 29:28.120
You're talking about people who are using the subsystem in Windows, pretty much, who

29:28.120 --> 29:30.840
would be interested in having a device for this.

29:30.840 --> 29:35.880
I don't know, there's been a lot of attempts at this before, and Samsung is a huge company,

29:35.880 --> 29:39.920
and maybe it'll spur a bit more Linux adoption, but I don't know, I'm not holding my breath

29:39.920 --> 29:42.320
for a massive success here, really.

29:42.320 --> 29:45.600
You know, I'm about to hit the road and go to scale, and I have to be honest, it would

29:45.600 --> 29:51.000
give me a bit of peace of mind if I knew I could take my phone with me and do everything

29:51.000 --> 29:52.980
I need from the road.

29:52.980 --> 29:54.640
That's where they're getting for developers.

29:54.640 --> 29:58.240
They're not there for content producers yet, but that's where they're getting for software

29:58.240 --> 29:59.240
developers.

29:59.240 --> 30:04.120
And if you put your mind in that sort of frame of reference, it is sort of a compelling device,

30:04.120 --> 30:10.240
a $1,000 phone, which you almost have to get anyways these days if you're a software developer.

30:10.240 --> 30:14.420
It also can be your emergency workstation where you can bring up the Firefox web browser

30:14.420 --> 30:17.200
and a terminal and maybe Eclipse.

30:17.200 --> 30:18.800
I can see where their head's at.

30:18.800 --> 30:21.520
I don't know if anybody's willing to put their wallets there, but I guess we'll just have

30:21.520 --> 30:22.520
to wait and see.

30:22.520 --> 30:23.520
Yeah.

30:23.520 --> 30:28.080
Well, a quick follow-up on last week, we talked about Linux running on the Nintendo Switch,

30:28.080 --> 30:31.780
and it was just kind of a command line, and I said, we're not going to have GNOME running

30:31.780 --> 30:35.080
on this, and then I kind of jokingly said, ah, someone will probably hack it.

30:35.080 --> 30:38.480
And sure enough, we've now had from the same people who hacked it in the first place fail

30:38.480 --> 30:43.800
overflow, a demo of it running the Plasma desktop and Chromium browser, and actually

30:43.800 --> 30:47.000
running quite nicely with touchscreen and everything.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.720
Yeah, it does run really good.

30:48.720 --> 30:52.000
That was the thing I noticed, and I was like, oh, damn, the Switch has good touchscreen

30:52.000 --> 30:54.100
support under Linux.

30:54.100 --> 30:58.360
This is the moment where I realized, I bet I could justify this as a tax write-off for

30:58.360 --> 30:59.360
the job.

30:59.360 --> 31:04.000
Maybe if I end up with one, but it totally crossed my mind.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Nice.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.440
Well, you heard me mention earlier, I'm going to be at scale in just a couple of weeks.

31:09.440 --> 31:13.600
March 8th through the 11th is scale in Pasadena, California.

31:13.600 --> 31:14.600
I know, I know.

31:14.600 --> 31:16.200
But if you're going to be there, come say hi to me.

31:16.200 --> 31:20.640
