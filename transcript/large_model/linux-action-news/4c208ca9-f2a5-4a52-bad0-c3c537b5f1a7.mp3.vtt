Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News. Episode 198, recorded on July 17th, 2021. I'm Chris.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.480
And I'm Wes.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.140
Hello, Wes. Let's do the news.

00:12.140 --> 00:17.000
And this is Steam Deck. It's a handheld, high-powered gaming device that lets you take your Steam

00:17.000 --> 00:21.800
library with you wherever you are. It's got a beautiful seven-inch display, ergonomic

00:21.800 --> 00:26.880
controls that are really built for long play sessions, and a new look for Steam designed

00:26.880 --> 00:31.800
for Steam Deck. You can think about Steam Deck like a portable gaming PC with built-in

00:31.800 --> 00:32.800
controllers.

00:32.800 --> 00:37.640
And it runs Linux. Arch Linux, actually, with a Plasma desktop.

00:37.640 --> 00:42.240
Yep, that's right. And it's available for reservation right now. The first units, Valvik

00:42.240 --> 00:44.840
Specs, will ship in December 2021.

00:44.840 --> 00:53.840
It comes in at three different price points. $399, $529, and $649. Each price brings more

00:53.840 --> 00:59.240
storage with the top two tiers offering faster built-in storage, but all levels come with

00:59.240 --> 01:01.620
an SD card slot for some expansion.

01:01.620 --> 01:05.580
In an interview with IGN, Gabe Newell says they had to work aggressively to get the price

01:05.580 --> 01:10.520
points down to where they are now. Note, this clip I'm about to play from IGN, it has music

01:10.520 --> 01:14.680
baked in. I apologize for that. But we think that the information from the bearded horse's

01:14.680 --> 01:19.600
mouth is worth it.

01:19.600 --> 01:24.000
One of the things we're testing on this is that price performance is going to be one

01:24.000 --> 01:30.420
of the critical factors in the mobile space. And so we've had to be very aggressive in

01:30.420 --> 01:34.320
terms of pricing on the deck.

01:34.320 --> 01:38.880
Because of its form factor, many people are comparing the deck to the Nintendo Switch.

01:38.880 --> 01:42.840
Sure, that was one of my first thoughts as well. But when you look at the specs, Valve

01:42.840 --> 01:46.840
has managed to cram into the deck. I think maybe the comparison becomes a little less

01:46.840 --> 01:52.600
clear. The deck has an AMD Zen 2 processor with 4 cores and 8 threads. It's got 16 gigabytes

01:52.600 --> 01:58.200
of RAM and has an 8 core GPU that bursts up to 1.6 GHz. So in a lot of ways, this is more

01:58.200 --> 02:03.400
comparable to a modern Xbox, but just in a portable form factor. And Valve's actually

02:03.400 --> 02:09.040
hoping that the combination of this hardware running at 720p on the display will produce

02:09.040 --> 02:14.960
really good gameplay, even at rather high game settings. And their goal is to potentially

02:14.960 --> 02:15.960
sell millions.

02:15.960 --> 02:20.880
So our view is if we're doing this right, that we're going to be selling these millions

02:20.880 --> 02:28.800
of units, and it's clearly going to be establishing a product category that ourselves and other

02:28.800 --> 02:33.440
PC manufacturers are going to be able to participate in. And that's going to have long-term benefits

02:33.440 --> 02:37.240
for us. So that's sort of the frame in which we're thinking about this.

02:37.240 --> 02:43.480
Valve is talking about defining a whole new product category here. One that would be powered

02:43.480 --> 02:44.480
by Linux.

02:44.480 --> 02:49.920
And the reaction overall seems really positive. You can really see if you've been watching

02:49.920 --> 02:55.040
Valve for a while, a lot of the lessons they've learned building hardware over the years are

02:55.040 --> 02:56.360
baked into the deck.

02:56.360 --> 03:01.300
Ultimately, it's an evolution of years of hardware and software design work. We've taken everything

03:01.300 --> 03:06.320
we've learned from developing the Steam Controller, Steam Machine, Steam Link, and Valve Index,

03:06.320 --> 03:10.680
along with the Steam Client, and applied all of that collective experience in designing

03:10.680 --> 03:11.680
Steam Deck.

03:11.680 --> 03:16.560
That's Eric from Valve, and a video they created for developers interested in supporting

03:16.560 --> 03:18.160
the Deck.

03:18.160 --> 03:22.760
One of those hardware lessons that set the Deck apart from devices like the Switch are

03:22.760 --> 03:28.960
the built-in trackpads. And while definitely something we'll want to go hands-on with,

03:28.960 --> 03:32.600
the way Valve describes them sounds promising.

03:32.600 --> 03:37.040
The trackpads here are an evolution of the same technology that we've been working on

03:37.040 --> 03:42.360
since the Steam Controller days and experimenting with internally. You also have seen some of

03:42.360 --> 03:45.920
our trackpad work as part of the Index Controller, for example.

03:45.920 --> 03:50.440
They can be used for many different things. We have a keyboard that lets you do dual thumb

03:50.440 --> 03:56.160
typing. In-game, you can map them to areas of the screen for a mouse cursor to jump there

03:56.160 --> 04:02.240
and be kind of a one-to-one region type input. You can create on-screen menus that pop up

04:02.240 --> 04:09.360
on top of the game and have many customizable macro buttons or keyboard keys. And you can

04:09.360 --> 04:14.400
just use it for mouse input, where it's really powerful and reliable for the people that

04:14.400 --> 04:16.760
are comfortable with that sort of input.

04:16.760 --> 04:22.400
And something that Valve stresses multiple times in their interviews is the Deck is just

04:22.400 --> 04:28.240
a PC. An open PC at that, you could even load Windows on it. And users will be able to connect

04:28.240 --> 04:35.280
just about any device compatible with Linux to the Deck, but Valve is also working on

04:35.280 --> 04:36.960
a direct dock solution.

04:36.960 --> 04:40.080
Yes, we're producing a dock. It'll be sold separately.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.800
Is there a price on that yet?

04:41.800 --> 04:43.840
We don't have a price for you today.

04:43.840 --> 04:46.120
Will that be available at launch?

04:46.120 --> 04:48.120
Don't have that answer for you yet today either.

04:48.120 --> 04:52.840
There's plenty of existing off-the-shelf solutions. I don't think that it'll be, you know, providing

04:52.840 --> 04:56.340
this nice experience, but a similar functionality.

04:56.340 --> 05:02.360
Any USB-C dock that you can buy off the shelf will work with this, and it'll do USB, Ethernet,

05:02.360 --> 05:05.160
and HDMI out, all of the things you would expect from a dock.

05:05.160 --> 05:10.080
One thing we don't have a very clear picture of just yet is the battery life.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.960
Well, there's a wide variety of experiences there. It's about two to eight hours, depending

05:13.960 --> 05:17.480
on what you're doing. You can play Portal 2 for four hours on this thing. If you limit

05:17.480 --> 05:20.440
to 30 FPS, you're going to be playing for five to six hours.

05:20.440 --> 05:25.360
That's something we're going to want to test when we get our hands on the actual hardware.

05:25.360 --> 05:29.880
One aspect that's caught the attention of some developers is the Deck's launch is really

05:29.880 --> 05:34.440
focused on Proton for game compatibility. In fact, there's hardly a word about native

05:34.440 --> 05:39.880
gameplay at all from Valve in the announcements or in their documentation for developers.

05:39.880 --> 05:44.280
Steam Deck runs games using Proton. And if you aren't familiar with Proton, it was originally

05:44.280 --> 05:50.200
released back in 2018, and it's a compatibility layer that allows Windows games to run on

05:50.200 --> 05:51.200
Linux.

05:51.200 --> 05:56.160
And it seems Valve is shooting for the moon when it comes to compatibility with Proton.

05:56.160 --> 06:00.560
The team has been working on and improving Proton for a while now. Most APIs are already

06:00.560 --> 06:05.000
supported by Proton, and most games already just work. And the team is building support

06:05.000 --> 06:08.560
for more APIs and enabling more games by default.

06:08.560 --> 06:12.940
Our goal is for every game to work by the time we ship Steam Deck. We are constantly

06:12.940 --> 06:16.880
building on Proton, and there's a lot of work that has been done that doesn't yet affect

06:16.880 --> 06:21.460
the public version of Proton, including testing of thousands of games, engaging with third

06:21.460 --> 06:26.160
parties like anti-cheat providers, work targeting game compatibility, and more.

06:26.160 --> 06:30.400
Yeah, Valve says they're actually going for 100% compatibility and that they'll be working

06:30.400 --> 06:35.440
with anti-cheat vendors directly to try to get Proton compatibility. I have been contacted

06:35.440 --> 06:40.760
by some developers in the Linux game space, however, that say that they've been nudged

06:40.760 --> 06:45.880
or encouraged by Valve to focus on a Proton version of their game instead of a native

06:45.880 --> 06:49.520
Linux port that they might have already had in the works. I don't know if that's true

06:49.520 --> 06:53.600
or not, those are just the rumors going around on the internet that Valve seems to be really

06:53.600 --> 06:57.680
pushing for Proton, but I could see in this early stage they really want the narrative

06:57.680 --> 07:02.340
to be around compatibility. They don't want users or developers thinking games are all

07:02.340 --> 07:06.320
going to have to be ported in order for them to work on the Deck. I can see Valve wanting

07:06.320 --> 07:09.240
to focus a lot on that Proton compatibility right now.

07:09.240 --> 07:13.440
Yeah, it seems clear that they want to have a narrative out there for developers. Listen,

07:13.440 --> 07:17.800
this is new, it's different, you might not be experienced supporting a Linux-based platform.

07:17.800 --> 07:18.800
We've got your back.

07:18.800 --> 07:23.860
They definitely are getting developers hardware. It's just going to be a little bit and it

07:23.860 --> 07:28.020
sounds like developer kits will be in very limited supply.

07:28.020 --> 07:31.720
The answer is we're currently building dev kits and have earmarked some of those units

07:31.720 --> 07:36.760
for partners like you to test your games. And these dev kits will be identical to the

07:36.760 --> 07:40.620
same Steam Decks that we'll be shipping off to customers that they'll be playing later

07:40.620 --> 07:46.060
this year, except for a few small cosmetic differences. And supplies are really limited

07:46.060 --> 07:50.400
and so we're going to have a program where you're going to be able to request a dev kit

07:50.400 --> 07:53.760
soon and we'll be sure to keep you posted and let you know the moment you can submit

07:53.760 --> 07:54.760
a request.

07:54.760 --> 07:58.560
Now I am a little concerned if they are pushing everyone towards Proton, if this is true or

07:58.560 --> 08:03.360
not, and I could see that creating some incentives around the Steam platform, developers would

08:03.360 --> 08:07.800
really be targeting the Proton environment, especially if something like the Deck really

08:07.800 --> 08:11.480
took off and there were multiple versions by multiple hardware makers. I don't know

08:11.480 --> 08:16.540
if you remember this, Wes, but Dell actually took a shot at creating a Switch-like machine

08:16.540 --> 08:18.640
a little while ago too, but bailed on the project.

08:18.640 --> 08:19.640
Oh really?

08:19.640 --> 08:23.680
Yeah, so you could see maybe if this sells well, Dell picks a project like that up again

08:23.680 --> 08:27.520
and of course they're going to use SteamOS, it's free, and Valve is going to want to guarantee

08:27.520 --> 08:32.320
that those games work like a console. And so maybe that's why they'd be pushing something

08:32.320 --> 08:37.120
like Proton. I don't love that though, because I think the dream about Steam coming to Linux

08:37.120 --> 08:42.440
originally was availability for all Linux distributions, getting games just native on

08:42.440 --> 08:46.720
Linux, but if this is the case, I still am compelled to get one.

08:46.720 --> 08:50.920
I mean, at the end of the day, it's a Linux machine that plays your games, right?

08:50.920 --> 08:54.960
I love the form factor, I love that they're going to include the Plasma desktop, and like

08:54.960 --> 08:59.120
they stressed over and over and over again, it's an open PC so you could really throw

08:59.120 --> 09:00.300
anything on there.

09:00.300 --> 09:04.520
Are you locked into Steam or can you, because you mentioned this a minute ago, Pierre-Luc,

09:04.520 --> 09:10.080
or can I log into the Microsoft Store with my Game Pass Ultimate account or my Epic Game

09:10.080 --> 09:11.080
Store account?

09:11.080 --> 09:15.640
Again, you can really do anything that you would expect a PC to be able to do, so the

09:15.640 --> 09:17.360
answer to those things is yes.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.520
Yes, excellent.

09:18.520 --> 09:24.760
The switch to Arch as the base for SteamOS is, frankly, a little surprising, and Valve

09:24.760 --> 09:31.360
has confirmed users will have full access to Pac-Man and the usual Arch package repos.

09:31.360 --> 09:36.040
We're going to dig more into the DeX Linux implementation with our expanded coverage

09:36.040 --> 09:39.760
in this week's Linux Unplugged.

09:39.760 --> 09:45.200
Well speaking of handheld-powered Linux devices, Ubuntu Touch OTA 18 has introduced a new way

09:45.200 --> 09:49.300
for Ubuntu Touch to scale down the wallpapers that you have set.

09:49.300 --> 09:51.600
You know, your high-resolution wallpapers, guess what?

09:51.600 --> 09:54.960
They take a fair amount of RAM, and that's really going to benefit some of the lower-end

09:54.960 --> 09:59.860
devices running Ubuntu Touch, like phones with less than a gigabyte of RAM.

09:59.860 --> 10:04.960
This release also comes with an updated MediaHub component, which is being used by Ubuntu Touch

10:04.960 --> 10:10.800
apps for audio and video playback, so expect a smoother, more reliable experience there.

10:10.800 --> 10:14.880
And of course, there is, as always, a batch of bug fixes that just make your experience

10:14.880 --> 10:20.800
smoother and more stable, but there is a significant fix in here for Google Pixel 2 devices that

10:20.800 --> 10:23.760
were having audio call quality problems.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.980
You'll definitely want to check the notes for that.

10:26.980 --> 10:33.160
We covered Amazon's announcement of their Elasticsearch fork back in episode 173 in

10:33.160 --> 10:35.000
late January.

10:35.000 --> 10:42.440
This week, Amazon announced the first production-ready version of that fork, named OpenSearch.

10:42.440 --> 10:46.160
Amazon first released OpenSearch back in April, but it was in alpha then.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.800
It just really wasn't ready for production use.

10:48.800 --> 10:52.800
Amazon's making the statement now with version 1.0, which is available up on GitHub, that

10:52.800 --> 10:57.920
OpenSearch is ready for production environments, and Amazon is eager to remind everyone it's

10:57.920 --> 11:01.080
very much open source and they would like your contributions.

11:01.080 --> 11:02.680
In a blog post, they wrote,

11:02.680 --> 11:09.920
We encourage anyone to use, modify, extend, embed, monetize, resell, and offer OpenSearch

11:09.920 --> 11:13.120
as part of their products and services.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.600
They go on to say,

11:14.600 --> 11:18.080
Broad adoption benefits the entire community.

11:18.080 --> 11:23.200
This has been in the works, really, since AWS launched its Elasticsearch service in

11:23.200 --> 11:25.760
October of 2015.

11:25.760 --> 11:32.120
That kicked off a whole series of events that have led us to this announcement today.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.600
We are now living in a post-server-side public license era.

11:35.600 --> 11:36.600
Yeah.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.600
Okay.

11:37.600 --> 11:42.280
So back in March of 2019, AWS created its own distribution of Elasticsearch.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.840
Now that's distribution and not fork.

11:44.840 --> 11:50.120
Because at the time, while they were unhappy that Elastic, the upstream developer of Elasticsearch,

11:50.120 --> 11:54.240
sort of keeping some of their more useful components out of the core open source project

11:54.240 --> 11:57.240
and making you pay for those.

11:57.240 --> 12:01.920
Amazon's new distro was called the Open Distro for Elasticsearch, and they were pretty clear

12:01.920 --> 12:06.880
that they were not forking Elasticsearch and still intended to contribute back upstream.

12:06.880 --> 12:11.800
Yeah, however, Elastic remained unhappy with the use of the Elasticsearch name by Amazon

12:11.800 --> 12:14.200
and its trademarks, essentially.

12:14.200 --> 12:18.920
And at the start of 2021, they changed the product to be dual license under their own

12:18.920 --> 12:24.400
Elastic license and that SSPL or the server-side public license that was originally created

12:24.400 --> 12:25.900
by MongoDB.

12:25.900 --> 12:31.520
This relicensing had the effect of making it difficult for cloud providers to run Elasticsearch

12:31.520 --> 12:36.880
as a service, since now they would have to publish all the proprietary magic in the backend

12:36.880 --> 12:39.360
that actually makes that service work.

12:39.360 --> 12:43.560
Elastic's move was also kind of unpopular with the open source community, especially

12:43.560 --> 12:48.160
those who had contributed code, believing it would always be free to use under the Apache

12:48.160 --> 12:59.800
2.0 license, but this time around with a new name and explicitly forked from Elasticsearch

12:59.800 --> 13:02.800
just prior to those license changes.

13:02.800 --> 13:08.120
The company also introduced open search dashboards, a fork of Kibana.

13:08.120 --> 13:13.540
But now all of that is history, and the key question going forward is how successful was

13:13.540 --> 13:19.200
the company be in actually building a community around open search?

13:19.200 --> 13:24.940
Linode.com slash LAN.

13:24.940 --> 13:29.040
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account.

13:29.040 --> 13:34.720
Linode started in 2003 as one of the very first companies in cloud computing.

13:34.720 --> 13:40.120
And now, 18 years later, Linode is the largest independent open cloud provider in the world

13:40.120 --> 13:45.680
with 11 global data centers serving nearly a million customers and businesses around

13:45.680 --> 13:46.680
the globe.

13:46.680 --> 13:50.800
Linode's mission, though, remains unchanged since the day it began, to accelerate innovation

13:50.800 --> 13:55.480
by making cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible to all.

13:55.480 --> 14:00.240
That's led to one of the best experiences out there, and why we host everything on Linode.

14:00.240 --> 14:04.960
Linode has an easy-to-use, powerful cloud dashboard, S3-compatible object storage, bare

14:04.960 --> 14:09.160
metal service cloud firewalls, DDoS protection, VLAN support, a powerful DNS manager, block

14:09.160 --> 14:13.880
storage, object storage, Kubernetes support, and even simple one-click applications, plus

14:13.880 --> 14:19.040
super fast networking and so much more, with pricing that's 30% to 50% cheaper than other

14:19.040 --> 14:20.920
major cloud providers out there.

14:20.920 --> 14:26.080
I find a simple $5 a month Linode offers a surprising amount of performance, and we love

14:26.080 --> 14:28.680
their dedicated CPU instances for our encoding jobs.

14:28.680 --> 14:33.880
And if you ever run into any trouble, Linode's got the best customer support out there, with

14:33.880 --> 14:36.560
hundreds of guides and tutorials to help you get started.

14:36.560 --> 14:39.400
And their community support, it runs deep.

14:39.400 --> 14:44.080
They're making our Colony Reunion trip possible, with meetups in Salt Lake City and Denver,

14:44.080 --> 14:47.340
and more along the way, all powered by Linode.

14:47.340 --> 14:48.600
So what do you gotta do?

14:48.600 --> 14:53.920
Go use our $100 60-day credit to performance test your network, to build an application,

14:53.920 --> 14:55.360
or to learn something.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.840
You know, they do have a tutorial on IPperf.

14:57.840 --> 15:01.720
You can use that to diagnose your network performance and see what's up.

15:01.720 --> 15:05.100
Plus, Linode could just be part of a multi-cloud strategy.

15:05.100 --> 15:06.640
That's why you gotta go check it out.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.720
There's a ton you can do, and a ton you can learn.

15:09.720 --> 15:12.080
So go take advantage of that $100.

15:21.000 --> 15:38.880
News at linode.com slash LAN.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.080
Are you ready for mobile to get simple?

15:41.080 --> 15:42.080
Linux.ting.com.

15:42.080 --> 15:46.420
You see, Ting is an MVNO, a mobile virtual network operator.

15:46.420 --> 15:50.240
That means they're not digging holes and putting towers in, but they're getting access to the

15:50.240 --> 15:51.240
same towers.

15:51.240 --> 15:55.520
They're getting access to the big networks, but at a lower cost.

15:55.520 --> 15:59.480
And with Ting Mobile, you get the same coast-to-coast coverage as you would with, say, one of those

15:59.480 --> 16:05.640
big carriers, but you just pay less, and you get Ting's fantastic customer service.

16:05.640 --> 16:10.320
All of Ting's plans are simple and straightforward, like their new set 12 plan, 12 gigs of data,

16:10.320 --> 16:14.640
35 bucks a month, unlimited talk, unlimited text.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.120
It's pretty great for 35 bucks a month.

16:17.120 --> 16:20.360
And of course, they have family plans that are flexible that let you add as many lines

16:20.360 --> 16:23.760
as you need, and every line has unlimited text and calls.

16:23.760 --> 16:27.880
You get a shared pool of LTE and 5G, and they have flexible pricing.

16:27.880 --> 16:33.200
If you use 2 gigs, 20 gigs, or a lot more, there's a perfect Ting plan just for you.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.700
And every plan is contract-free.

16:35.700 --> 16:41.680
With their great interface, fantastic, straightforward UI, it's simple to switch to Ting.

16:41.680 --> 16:45.700
And pretty much any phone works with Ting because they do support so many networks.

16:45.700 --> 16:51.520
So to get started, just go to linux.ting.com, check your current phone, create an account,

16:51.520 --> 16:53.520
and pick the plan that's right for you.

16:53.520 --> 16:55.920
When everything lines up, Ting will send you a SIM card.

16:55.920 --> 16:58.920
You pop that in your phone, and you get activated in minutes.

16:58.920 --> 17:02.640
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier with Ting's brand new plans.

17:02.640 --> 17:04.840
It truly is the next generation of Ting mobile.

17:04.840 --> 17:09.120
I've been a longtime customer, and I can tell you they've never had plans this great.

17:09.120 --> 17:18.080
So go see how much you could save and take $25 off of that at linux.ting.com.

17:18.080 --> 17:24.720
On Wednesday, July 14, Microsoft announced Windows 365, a new service that makes it possible

17:24.720 --> 17:30.520
for users to run a full version of Windows right in a web browser on a device of their

17:30.520 --> 17:31.520
choice.

17:31.520 --> 17:37.700
The new service is based on a similar Azure offering, but at first will only be available

17:37.700 --> 17:39.160
for businesses.

17:39.160 --> 17:44.160
Although given Microsoft's tone and the announcements, it seems pretty likely it will become available

17:44.160 --> 17:46.600
for consumers pretty soon.

17:46.600 --> 17:53.240
Today we are continuing this journey and creating a new category with Windows, the cloud PC.

17:53.240 --> 17:57.340
I'm excited to announce Windows 365.

17:57.340 --> 18:02.100
With Windows 365, we are making Windows available not just on Windows devices, but any device

18:02.100 --> 18:04.180
harnessing the power of the cloud.

18:04.180 --> 18:06.440
This has never been done before, and think about it.

18:06.440 --> 18:09.800
Just like applications were brought to the cloud with SaaS, we are now bringing the operating

18:09.800 --> 18:12.120
system to the cloud with Windows 365.

18:12.120 --> 18:16.400
That was Satya Nadella during the introduction, and they really emphasized the fact that you

18:16.400 --> 18:21.840
can run this on Linux and Android and iPads, because Windows 365 is creating a virtual

18:21.840 --> 18:24.280
PC in the cloud that you get access to.

18:24.280 --> 18:28.580
The cloud PC you set up with Windows 365 can be completely personalized.

18:28.580 --> 18:32.920
You get to choose how much RAM you want, like up to 16 gigs at least, and how much storage

18:32.920 --> 18:35.600
you want, at least up to 512 gigabytes.

18:35.600 --> 18:40.440
Things you tweak and change about the PC remain persistent even after you disconnect.

18:40.440 --> 18:44.800
Microsoft says they've built this thing around a zero trust architecture, and they're also

18:44.800 --> 18:49.240
offering an instant on boot experience, and well, I have to say all that seems pretty

18:49.240 --> 18:50.240
likely.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.760
I would expect Microsoft to invest heavily in the security architecture of this thing

18:52.760 --> 18:58.560
such as it is, so that way services like Windows 365 would be compliant with some of the more

18:58.560 --> 19:03.360
rigorous regulatory requirements out there, at least eventually.

19:03.360 --> 19:07.060
And really, instant on, that sounds like a natural evolution of what Microsoft has been

19:07.060 --> 19:09.920
building with virtual machines for years.

19:09.920 --> 19:10.920
Right.

19:10.920 --> 19:15.600
There's a lot of things they've been working on here, including RDP, which is the back-end

19:15.600 --> 19:16.600
protocol.

19:16.600 --> 19:24.840
Now, Microsoft's been working on that since 1998 with Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition.

19:24.840 --> 19:29.000
They've built numerous ways to deliver an RDP session, so it's not really a surprise

19:29.000 --> 19:32.720
that they could get broad device compatibility that way.

19:32.720 --> 19:39.440
What is new here is that this is a first-party offering right from Microsoft, and they're

19:39.440 --> 19:43.200
strongly positioning it as a hybrid solution.

19:43.200 --> 19:49.480
With Windows 365, the operating system itself becomes hybrid, accessible on the device as

19:49.480 --> 19:50.480
well as the cloud.

19:50.480 --> 19:55.100
Well, I guess in the aggregate, this might mean more Windows users.

19:55.100 --> 19:58.440
You could especially see the use case scenario in the enterprise environment where you could

19:58.440 --> 20:03.480
deploy cheap low-end hardware, maybe even Raspberry Pis, and just spin up a client that

20:03.480 --> 20:07.720
connects to a Windows machine in the cloud that Microsoft is continually updating.

20:07.720 --> 20:14.400
It's really going to be ideal, I hope, for potential and existing desktop Linux users.

20:14.400 --> 20:18.760
You know, the ones that have that one Windows app that you just have to have for work or

20:18.760 --> 20:19.760
whatever.

20:19.760 --> 20:24.680
Now you'll be able to immediately and instantly load up a modern version of Windows that has

20:24.680 --> 20:28.800
been built on a virtual server that is run by the OS vendor.

20:28.800 --> 20:32.920
So not only does that mean more people are going to be able to use desktop Linux, Microsoft

20:32.920 --> 20:36.480
says this is a long-term project, so it means they're going to be pushing the industry to

20:36.480 --> 20:42.040
take this thing seriously and support Windows 365 like a full-fledged version of Windows

20:42.040 --> 20:43.840
in a universal way.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.280
That's huge for Linux users.

20:45.280 --> 20:48.640
That means when they need Windows software, they're likely going to be able to run it

20:48.640 --> 20:50.520
on Windows 365.

20:50.520 --> 20:52.880
It's funny how this changes the framing a little bit.

20:52.880 --> 20:57.680
I'm realizing that, okay, I don't love Windows in general, but I really don't like it running

20:57.680 --> 20:58.680
on my device.

20:58.680 --> 21:03.920
And if Microsoft makes it easy for me to just use Windows when I have to, that's honestly

21:03.920 --> 21:04.920
pretty nice.

21:04.920 --> 21:08.880
I've played with Azure virtual desktops a little bit and played with running VMs on

21:08.880 --> 21:13.400
Azure, and none of it was as seamless as it sounds like Windows 365 is going to be.

21:13.400 --> 21:17.080
And I'll say this too, Wes, I've always felt like the best way to run Windows is in the

21:17.080 --> 21:21.040
safety of a virtual machine, and now they're just going to do it for you.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.720
It is funny how long it took them to get here in a sense.

21:23.720 --> 21:28.920
I mean, other providers like Amazon have had this for a while, but Microsoft being the

21:28.920 --> 21:34.200
maker of the operating system, I think, does give them pretty good advantage as an example.

21:34.200 --> 21:38.840
They've got some nice tie-ins with existing Microsoft admin tools built into this thing

21:38.840 --> 21:39.840
already.

21:39.840 --> 21:40.840
Yeah, I agree.

21:40.840 --> 21:45.420
It does seem like this has been a long time in the works, a lot like the first story we

21:45.420 --> 21:47.400
started with with the deck.

21:47.400 --> 21:51.280
The Steam Deck also feels like it's something that Valve has been working towards for a

21:51.280 --> 21:52.480
long time.

21:52.480 --> 21:58.520
But where Microsoft is going to stand out from, say, like the Amazon Web Services workspace

21:58.520 --> 22:04.720
service, is Microsoft is going to offer a flat rate fee instead of a consumption-based

22:04.720 --> 22:07.800
fee structure like it does for Azure and AWS does.

22:07.800 --> 22:12.240
So they may have something that people can just pay a flat rate, maybe consumers could

22:12.240 --> 22:17.920
pay like $10 a month and they get access to Windows 365 and Office 365 and they get everybody

22:17.920 --> 22:19.160
all nice and locked in.

22:19.160 --> 22:22.720
You know, that seems like where this is going.

22:22.720 --> 22:26.600
But I look at it as an opportunity to enable more desktop Linux and I prefer to look at

22:26.600 --> 22:27.600
it that way.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.240
But we'll keep an eye on it and we'll keep an eye on everything else going on in the

22:30.240 --> 22:31.240
open source Linux world.

22:31.240 --> 22:36.200
