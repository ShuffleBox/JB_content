00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,960
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,120
This is episode 68, recorded on August 26, 2018.

3
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,120
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,120
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,120
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,280
It's great to be connected with you.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,960
We have some major milestones to get into this week, and let's start with Flatpak hitting

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,880
version 1.0.

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,960
Yes, talk about a major milestone.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,640
This is them setting their stall out, isn't it?

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,280
Saying that Flatpak is ready for mainstream adoption now, mainstream use.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,280
It's 1.0.

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,100
There's nowhere for them to hide now.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:50,280
This is the successor to the 0.10x series, which was first introduced in October of 2017.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,020
And there are many new features, which we will have linked in the show notes.

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,460
But I wanted to call out a couple of my personal favorites, the new portals that allow apps

17
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:02,560
to create sandboxes and then restart themselves so they've been maybe updated or they have

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
new permissions.

19
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:07,040
They'll be smarter about that and more on those portals in a moment.

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,240
Apps can now also use D-Bus services better by giving specific names to the applications

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,880
on the D-Bus rather than just trying to guess what the application ID means.

22
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,360
And one of the cooler ones, apps can now request access to the host SSH agent to securely get

23
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,120
access to a remote server or maybe even like a Git repository.

24
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,520
There's a whole bunch of stuff in there, including one of my favorite ones, like Flatpak no longer

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,880
requiring file systems that support extended attributes, hello Dropbox.

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,400
And those portals, those portals are going to be great because they're more separated

27
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,680
now from Flatpak and they've been moved to the XDG desktop portal project and they're

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,620
working with snaps as well.

29
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,000
And this is going to grant users the ability to say, deny access to my camera or allow

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,160
access to my camera to a completely containerized secure application.

31
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,280
It's great stuff.

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,640
One thing that struck me about this is quite how many new features they've got in this

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,640
1.0 release.

34
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,540
And you do have to wonder, does this mean now they're at 1.0, they're going to slow

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,940
down a bit or are they just going to keep adding more and more features all the time?

36
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,080
It's nearly a weekly basis that I see some new use for Flatpak inside the larger GNOME

37
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,640
project as well.

38
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,800
And I bet a lot of the features that are being driven in Flatpak are coming from that tight

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,160
integration.

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,280
And I imagine that's going to continue.

41
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,560
And you mentioned snaps there.

42
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,240
I mean, that's kind of the elephant in the room here, isn't it?

43
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,240
Snaps are progressing at a really, really fast pace.

44
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,560
Canonical have thrown a lot of resources at snap.

45
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,900
And so is this 1.0 a kind of response to that?

46
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,720
Is it them saying, look, we're just as relevant too?

47
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,840
Yeah, we've really seen a lot of wins for snap packages this entire year.

48
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,400
I think almost on a weekly basis, you see some new project that everybody loves or some

49
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,840
new commercial application that's now a snap package.

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,880
What I find fascinating about this is this not really like this head-to-head dogfight

51
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,180
over two different package formats, because they're both kind of working together.

52
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,360
Snaps will be taking advantage of this XDG portal stuff.

53
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,040
Poppy and I got into this a little bit on last week's Linux Unplugged.

54
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,460
There's really a lot of cross-pollination happening here.

55
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:18,720
And it's not the kind of head-to-head battle that you might see blogs sort of frame it

56
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
as.

57
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,760
There is a bit of friendly competition there.

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,800
And you see them kind of spurring each other on and matching each other feature for feature.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,840
And that's the good thing about open source, they can collaborate while also being in competition

60
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,920
with each other.

61
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,600
And because all the code is out there in open source, you can take bits from each other

62
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,580
and certainly inspiration from each other.

63
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,680
And ultimately, everybody benefits as a result.

64
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,120
And like I said, last time we talked about this, there's not going to be one winner.

65
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,360
We're going to end up with snaps being great and flat packs being great and systems using

66
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
a mixture of both.

67
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,920
Well, congratulations to them, 1.0 is a major milestone.

68
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,040
And now let's move to the petro coin.

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,960
Joe's always looking for these stories that validate real world use cases for blockchain

70
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,040
technology.

71
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
You found a zinger this week, Joe.

72
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,360
Yeah, it's certainly a real world implementation, but I'm not sure how much value it has.

73
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,200
And so this is Venezuela.

74
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,900
Now they have had economic problems for quite some time now.

75
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,060
And their currency, their fiat currency has been going through hyperinflation.

76
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:25,680
And so in an attempt to kind of stabilize that, they have introduced a state backed

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,560
cryptocurrency and tied their fiat currency to it.

78
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:35,040
Yeah, it's called the petro and it's based itself on like their oil basket of assets.

79
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,740
And so their currency is pegged to a crypto coin, which is then pegged to a basket of

80
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,160
oil assets.

81
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,520
It's supposed to be a liquid asset reflective of the price of oil.

82
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,260
And of course, there's a white paper on it, which you can go read and it will tell you

83
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,520
basically nothing because this whole thing is an idea out of the president's office.

84
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,640
But it bakes down to an attempt to lend some credibility and stability to the country's

85
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,920
currency.

86
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,700
And this crypto coin is how they're doing it, including apps for mobile devices to help

87
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,960
do conversions and math.

88
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,220
And it is kind of working right now, but it's very early days.

89
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,980
The crypto coins really only existed since March.

90
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,460
It is on some exchanges as of right now, but not many.

91
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:24,100
And there is a lot of seeding, quote unquote, going on where people are investing, quote

92
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,880
unquote, with currency that the government set aside and kept for itself.

93
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,140
We'll see where all this goes.

94
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,760
But it is it's happening.

95
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,980
You have a country that is attempting to use a crypto coin and they're talking about it

96
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,640
to their citizens.

97
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,960
That seems like a big story, at least the beginning of one.

98
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,280
Yeah, I've been watching this for months now and I've seen nothing but skepticism about

99
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,680
it.

100
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,720
But I thought it was finally worth mentioning because this is something new.

101
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,400
This is a precedent being set here.

102
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,420
This is the first government actually implementing a state backed cryptocurrency.

103
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,440
This is not just people within a country using it and it becoming popular.

104
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,520
This is officially sanctioned.

105
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,000
And you wonder if this experiment goes badly, is that going to reflect badly on the rest

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,840
of the whole cryptocurrency and blockchain world or will people chalk it off?

107
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,720
I mean, I'm assuming it's going to go badly.

108
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,460
I mean, just from what I've read, I've read nothing but skepticism.

109
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,920
Nobody seems to be positive about it.

110
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
No, they don't.

111
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,200
I don't think it will spell doom for all crypto, though, because so many times I've seen these

112
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:37,920
one off crazy ideas and they blow up and then they fizzle away.

113
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,760
In the end, it's really hard to know how successful this thing is going to be.

114
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,760
What do we know?

115
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,560
Yeah, this is not our area of expertise.

116
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,760
There's a couple of details of this that I would love to just have looked at further.

117
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:56,360
The fact that they've pegged the value of a crypto coin to a physical asset is fascinating.

118
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,600
So Bitcoin, you know, we often refer to Bitcoin as its value compared to the dollar.

119
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,720
So it's pinned to the dollar.

120
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,240
A Bitcoin is worth six thousand six hundred and eighty nine dollars right now as we record.

121
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,680
It's pegged to the dollar's value.

122
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,080
But the petro coin being pegged to this basket of oil assets, that's interesting.

123
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,720
And then the fact that their fiat currency is pegged to the value of the cryptocurrency

124
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,740
is also new territory.

125
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,900
And those things, regardless of this whole shebang is successful or not, I'd love for

126
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,120
people to look at those things particularly because it seems like, for better or worse,

127
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,160
it gives the government full control over their own currency backed by a real physical

128
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
asset.

129
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,080
And again, I'm a Linux user, not an economist, but that seems worth studying.

130
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,720
Yeah, well, it's definitely going to be one to keep an eye on.

131
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,880
What is it about this time of year that means we have so many birthdays in the Linux and

132
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,920
open source world?

133
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Is it that people launch a lot of stuff at the end of summer?

134
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,400
They've been working throughout summer and then it was time to launch it?

135
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,560
Yeah, maybe it's those final summer projects, the last days of summer, you're doing your

136
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
code drop.

137
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Here it is.

138
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
Here's my announcement.

139
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
And we have a couple of great ones.

140
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,800
This week is Linux's 27th birthday.

141
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,240
And yes, Linux has two birthdays.

142
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,600
Yeah, but this is the official one for my money.

143
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
Yeah, you think so?

144
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:17,280
So you have, okay, some people say it's October 5th, 1991, because that's when the original

145
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,640
code was dropped.

146
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,840
But then others say, like yourself, that it's really August 25th, 1991 is the actual birthday

147
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,640
because that's when the announcement took place on the mailing list where Linus introduced

148
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,200
his humble operating system that would only work on 386s and would only work with ATH

149
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,200
clones.

150
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,480
Yeah, and it wouldn't be big and professional like GNU and all that stuff.

151
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,640
That for me is like the real milestone.

152
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,720
And I think that's when we should really celebrate the birthday.

153
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Yeah.

154
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,720
But 27 years, eh?

155
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Yeah.

156
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
It's a long time.

157
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
Yeah.

158
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,820
And yet, I think there's still quite a future ahead of it.

159
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,840
Something else even older this week, IRC hit 30.

160
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,200
And yet we're kind of still using it.

161
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,680
I use it occasionally, not as much as I used to, but there are some people and some projects.

162
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,040
Okay, a lot of people have gone to things like Slack and Mattermost and whatever, but

163
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,760
IRC is still going strong.

164
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,200
There's often bridges to IRC, aren't there, from everything, from Matrix and everything.

165
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Oh yeah.

166
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,200
IRC is actually really my favorite.

167
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,100
It's not the one I use the most these days, but it's still my favorite.

168
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,240
Something else that's interesting about some of these is these are born out of universities

169
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,240
back then.

170
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,040
That's where a lot of these projects came from, were universities.

171
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,480
Whereas now, we see a lot of the stuff coming out of corporations, Googles and Amazons.

172
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,440
You see these big projects like Kubernetes and whatnot that started at Google, where

173
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,040
in the past, they were starting at universities like IRC did.

174
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,800
Yeah, I think I'd be inclined to use IRC a bit more if they had Taylor Swift stickers

175
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
like Telegraph.

176
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,580
Yeah, T-Swift stickers makes everything better.

177
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,680
And just recently, last week, Debian turned 25, announced by Ian Murdoch on August 16th,

178
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,680
1993.

179
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,760
And he was just looking for something better than the competition, something better than

180
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,960
soft landing Linux system, which was founded by Peter MacDonald in May of 92.

181
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,400
Yeah, and it was almost around the same time as Slackware, but Slackware has been around

182
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,760
for just that little bit longer.

183
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,560
We talked about that recently.

184
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,000
And then last but not least on our list for this week, Gnome marks 21 years.

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,080
They're celebrating their 21st birthday, and they're doing it by releasing Gnome 3.29.91,

186
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,880
which is a second beta leading up to Gnome 3.30.

187
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,400
Yeah, that looks like it's shaping up to be a pretty decent release with improvements

188
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:33,440
to Network Manager, and they're also starting to talk about GTK4.

189
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,440
Last.ting.com.

190
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,400
Ting is smarter than unlimited.

191
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,360
If you use less, you just pay for less.

192
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,520
You don't have to try to guess how many minutes or messages you might use.

193
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,160
You just pay for the ones you use.

194
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,800
It's $6 to have a line, and then it's your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes,

195
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,600
however much you talk, text, and data you use is what you pay.

196
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,640
It's a system that's worked for me for over four years.

197
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,320
I've been a happy Ting customer with three lines now for a long time because it's $6.

198
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,440
I can have a phone, and I have two MiFis, one on CDMA and one on GSM, and I just keep

199
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
them active.

200
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,840
I could use the Ting control panel and turn services off when I don't want them, but it's

201
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,160
$6 a month.

202
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,440
The value there to have them available when I need data on either GSM or CDMA networks

203
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,120
is worth that $6.

204
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
And that's what I love about Ting.

205
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,520
They got you covered nationwide.

206
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,200
They have two different networks you get to choose from.

207
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,720
There's no contract if you do want to turn stuff off for a bit, and it's all manageable

208
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,560
through a great control panel where you can see your usage at a glance.

209
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,800
You can take complete control of any individual aspects.

210
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,140
And if you got kids, some of them might be kind of handy, is you can set usage alerts.

211
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,400
Maybe when they get to like 5 or 10 gigs of data, get a usage about that.

212
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,380
Hey, kid, go turn your Wi-Fi back on.

213
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,920
That's usually what it is for my kid.

214
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,520
And the thing I love about Ting is they have radically different customer service.

215
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,160
It's better than anybody else's out there.

216
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,520
And if you go to last.ting.com, not only are you supporting the show, but you're also going

217
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,360
to get $25 off a device or $25 in service credit if you bring a device.

218
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,280
They have a BYOD page where you can check your own.

219
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,560
Now there's also a limited time back-to-school promo where you can get a $100 Ting credit

220
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,720
when you get a Moto G6, which is a great phone, and they have details up on their blog.

221
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,780
It's just $250 for this phone, and then you own it outright with no contract.

222
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:15,180
There's no experience that Ting wants to flash on there.

223
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,920
You can just get updates when they push updates.

224
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,760
It's got a bright, beautiful screen for $250.

225
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,140
And as a back-to-school promo, you can get $100 credit for $23 per month phone on average.

226
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:29,960
That's $100 credit is going to last you for a long time.

227
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,480
Now, if you don't qualify for a back-to-school promo, don't worry.

228
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,960
If you go to last.ting.com, you still get a $25 service credit, which is likely going

229
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,200
to pay for more than your first month of Ting service.

230
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,900
That's how economical it is.

231
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,680
And you got a bunch of devices you can buy directly or you can bring your own.

232
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,440
Just get started by going to last.ting.com.

233
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:55,680
Okay, let's talk about Intel and their microcode updates, and specifically the license that

234
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,960
they released them under this week, but then changed their mind after quite a lot of pressure.

235
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,840
After getting called out by Debian in particular on one of them and many others, there was

236
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,980
a licensing term that got applied to the new microcode, amongst many things, like the fifth

237
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,680
new provision in there was.

238
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,460
You cannot publish or provide any software benchmark or comparison test results for anything

239
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,760
at least that used microcode.

240
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,180
Well, that would pretty much include all benchmarks for everything because microcode is running

241
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,680
for every single instruction on the system.

242
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,860
So it would have been a massive restriction on the entire benchmarking community if there

243
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,000
is such a thing.

244
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,220
And that rule applied to anything that used microcode.

245
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:43,440
And since every instruction on your system uses microcode, it seemed to apply to everything.

246
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,120
And people responded very strongly.

247
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,240
Debian immediately refused to distribute that to their credit.

248
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,140
And Intel thought about it a bit and looks like have changed things.

249
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:59,100
The question I think that first pops into the mind, though, is how does this happen?

250
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,980
How does language like this just show up in these microcode updates?

251
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,620
Like it isn't anything really flashy either.

252
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,460
It was a text file that gets added to the whole bundle and you just had to like read

253
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,140
the included text files.

254
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,340
Thankfully the people that are responsible for this stuff did.

255
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,280
And in there is where you see this restriction.

256
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,740
It's not up like on some new blog post where Intel's talking about a change in stance on

257
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,040
benchmarks or anything like that.

258
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,300
It's just this little text file that somehow a lawyer in Intel got included with the bundle

259
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,160
of microcode that goes to distributors.

260
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,160
How does that happen?

261
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,380
Well, why it happened was clearly because they're worried about people benchmarking

262
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,260
the difference before and after.

263
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:46,600
Because these speculative execution workarounds and mitigations do have a fairly significant

264
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,580
performance impact and they wanted to try and hush that.

265
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:56,860
But how that managed to happen, how it went through legal and PR and stuff, it just beggars

266
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,820
belief because clearly you're going to have a Streisand effect here.

267
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,820
Yeah, exactly.

268
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:02,820
And I think you nailed it.

269
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:09,900
I think it was a fear that these series of microcode updates are going to lead to worsening

270
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:14,100
and worsening performance and perhaps maybe even if we could speculate for a moment, there's

271
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,780
more in the future that are going to worsen performance even more.

272
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:21,100
But Intel wouldn't have been able to unilaterally apply this to all benchmarks.

273
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,180
So this would have been a tool that they would have selectively used against certain individuals

274
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,180
that they wanted to silence.

275
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:32,980
That's a, I grant you an extreme take, but it seems like the most likely use for this

276
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,160
tool that they were creating themselves.

277
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:41,460
I've seen a lot of discussion about this over the last week and even before that about how

278
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,860
if you look at someone like DigitalOcean, clearly they need to be applying these updates

279
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,520
because of VMs and people breaking out of that into other VMs and stuff.

280
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:55,560
But if you're just running this on your own machine, say your own laptop, there are people

281
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,900
who say you don't really need to install this proprietary code and take the performance

282
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,820
hit because the security risk is not that great.

283
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,860
I mean, I do not subscribe to that.

284
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,520
I will just update everything that I can.

285
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,740
Just why not?

286
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,820
It's better to be safe than sorry, but how do you feel?

287
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,420
Are you doing these updates where available?

288
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,980
I really have two thoughts on it.

289
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,620
Number one, I don't consider these to be just security updates.

290
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,780
Maybe some of these microcode updates are, but I generally consider these low-level firmware

291
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:35,180
updates to be improvements, security, and maybe even fixes to stuff that could actually

292
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,180
be really bad.

293
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:43,180
I kind of look at it as like a vendor recalling a flaw in the core logic inside my machine.

294
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,100
Sometimes they can make a mistake again, but sometimes they're trying to fix something

295
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,140
that they've now identified since something's been out in the field for a while.

296
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,020
So I try to look at microcode updates as a complex thing.

297
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:57,660
And then the second part of it is I also have to be aware that there's a lot more computer

298
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,860
in these individual chips than there used to be.

299
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,860
These are getting to be very sophisticated chips with some of them even having their

300
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:08,120
own operating systems and their own environments in there that need to be tended to.

301
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,780
And I don't like that, but if I neglect them, the system may suffer for it.

302
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,540
It's not as simple as it used to be, I guess is what I'm trying to say.

303
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:22,840
And so when I consider all of those factors, I do tend to be pretty religious about applying

304
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,120
these microcode updates and firmware updates.

305
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:31,600
If I saw an MV and eDrive update come down, thanks to LVFS in the future, I would do a

306
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,460
backup and then I would apply it because I am assuming that's a pretty important update

307
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,060
to make sure that my disk is safe long-term.

308
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,840
And that's just kind of my general outlook on these things.

309
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,220
But I do understand wanting to avoid all of that and just assume if it's working, it's

310
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,220
working.

311
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,140
If it's broken, don't fix it.

312
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,340
And you got to draw the line somewhere.

313
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,780
It's one thing to keep your desktop OS up to date, but the individual components inside

314
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,140
your PC?

315
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,140
Where do we draw the line?

316
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,340
I'd like to ask the audience to linuxactionnews.com slash contact.

317
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,340
All right.

318
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,180
Well, let's talk about the biggest story of the week.

319
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,400
And again, this is proprietary software, but it's got a lot of people excited.

320
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,840
We teased it last week, but now it's official.

321
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:16,200
You're going to be able to play some at least Windows games on Steam for Linux officially.

322
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,800
And they're calling it Steam Play, and they say it's powered by Proton.

323
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:25,680
Now Proton is a wrapping up of Wine and other tools, some of them which we talked about

324
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:33,020
last week, like DXVK, all into one subproject that then the Steam client sits on top of.

325
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,260
So what many people speculated last week, including myself, that DXVK was going to be

326
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,140
sort of at the core of this, turns out it's even more than that.

327
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,340
Not only is it the core of Steam Play, it has been funded by Valve.

328
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,580
They actually employed the DXVK developers since February of this year.

329
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:55,500
And on top of that, they also help fund VKD3D, which is a direct 3D12 implementation based

330
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,860
on Vulkan.

331
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,180
And they've been contributing towards OpenVR.

332
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,300
So the big question is why?

333
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,200
Why are they doing this?

334
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,820
We speculated that they started the whole Steam on Linux and Steam OS thing in the first

335
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:14,420
place because of potential changes to Windows and moving to an App Store only software installation

336
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,420
level.

337
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,180
That turned out not to be the case.

338
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:23,820
And so for a while, we've been thinking that Steam OS was pretty much dead.

339
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,180
The market share for Linux in Steam hasn't been growing significantly.

340
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,420
It kind of hovers around, what, 1%, if that.

341
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,520
And so why are they putting these resources into this?

342
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,620
It kind of doesn't make that much sense unless they see another potential change with Windows

343
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,620
coming.

344
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,620
Yeah, I follow you.

345
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,500
I mean, some people have even said this is going to hurt native game development now.

346
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,300
Developers will not be incentivized to release a Linux version anymore because they can just

347
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,300
use Steam Play, as if developers were just on the edge of their seat to release a whole

348
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,460
bunch of new games.

349
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:59,020
I think this is part of a bigger strategy.

350
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:04,200
I don't think it's 100% about Steam OS, and I don't think it's 100% about hedging against

351
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,660
Windows going to ARM or Windows locking everything down to a store.

352
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:16,460
I think it's about Valve having a store that when you buy a Steam game, you can play it

353
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,860
on any of your devices.

354
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,500
And it really kind of fits in with Steam Home Streaming as well.

355
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,620
I kind of see all of this stuff as one and the same.

356
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,580
With Steam Home Streaming, you could have a Windows PC in a closet that streams the

357
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,800
game to the Steam client on your Linux box or on your Chromebook even.

358
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,420
It's really just an H.264 video stream.

359
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,020
And they also do that with a Steam link, so you could have them on your TV with a controller

360
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,340
streaming off of a Windows PC or a Linux PC in your closet.

361
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,900
And that's not about advancing any one particular agenda either.

362
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,580
It's about you buy a game and you can play it across any platform, be it console, your

363
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,020
desktop, your Linux box, your Mac, all of it.

364
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,780
Because this also is being worked on on the Mac side too, by the way.

365
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,020
I don't think we've mentioned that.

366
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:04,020
But this stuff is also, they have a Mac build, haven't tested it, have tested the Linux version.

367
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,260
And when I tested the Linux version, the impression I got is, this is about your games

368
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,260
everywhere.

369
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,460
It's not even really about Steam OS.

370
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,860
And what was the performance like then?

371
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,420
Presumably you've tried Windows games with Wine and stuff before.

372
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,700
Is this significantly building on top of that?

373
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,700
So it's been pretty good.

374
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,020
I wouldn't say the performance blows me away, but the ease of use is great.

375
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,580
When this landed, I went and bought Age of Empires.

376
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,820
I don't own Age of Empires because I've never really been able to get it to work very well

377
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,180
on Linux.

378
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,500
And Microsoft's not going to re-release a game from the 90s on Linux.

379
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,920
That's not happening.

380
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,680
So I took this as an opportunity to buy it, because now I can finally play it reliably

381
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,680
from my Steam library.

382
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,340
I just install Steam, I switch over to the beta, I install Age of Empires, and I can

383
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,340
play now.

384
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,900
It's really straightforward and simple, and that matters.

385
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,900
And that's the kind of market where I think this is going to be great for.

386
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,340
The games that were never going to come to Linux anyways, I don't really care if it's

387
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,340
not the best performance.

388
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,580
I don't really need that for a game from the 90s.

389
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,580
I can play it now.

390
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,020
Well, that sounds like exactly what you need, yet more distractions.

391
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,340
And more things from the 90s.

392
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:13,220
Speaking of distractions and things from the 90s, there is now Windows 95 running inside

393
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,500
an Electron app.

394
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
The full thing.

395
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,900
Yeah, this has done the rounds on Twitter and stuff this week.

396
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,060
Everyone's talking about it, and it's funny that the developer apologizes everywhere he

397
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,060
can.

398
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,220
He's like, I'm sorry, I just had to do this, I couldn't resist.

399
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,940
And it really is a blast from the past, isn't it?

400
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,060
Although it does make you look at Windows 95 and think, well, certainly me.

401
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,060
I'm looking at XFCE.

402
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:38,760
It's really not very different from what I'm running as my desktop now, to be honest.

403
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,700
It's not that much different.

404
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,980
When you start getting into it, this is basically where we've been for a long time.

405
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,860
And you can kind of understand why there's been some open source projects that have tried

406
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,520
to throw the whole thing out and start over.

407
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,900
And by the way, for those of you who grabbed this when it first started making the rounds,

408
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,940
it's been updated a couple of times.

409
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,260
And there's a couple of nice improvements.

410
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,940
The ability to mount external disks, some more stats, a little bit of a code tweak.

411
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,860
Everything seemed a little snappier, so you can grab it again.

412
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,540
And then just download this Electron app and play around with Windows 95.

413
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,260
Yeah, it's obviously been Electron.

414
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,980
It's cross-platform as well.

415
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,740
So if you can run it on Windows 10, if you want, or a Mac even.

416
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,820
But it's funny that I swear I'd remembered this from before.

417
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,560
And I looked it up, and sure enough, I found the link.

418
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,620
Because this is based on JavaScript, I think it was the same as this web version before.

419
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,020
So you don't even need an Electron app.

420
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,620
You can just run it in the browser.

421
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,220
We'll stick a link to that in the show notes.

422
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,780
But that was from a good couple of years ago.

423
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,460
But it is a bit of fun, isn't it?

424
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,140
I don't think it's much more than that.

425
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:46,860
And I've seen a bit of talk about how this is clearly copyright infringement.

426
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,740
And so I would say grab it while you can, because it may well get pulled down.

427
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:53,780
Yeah, I'm surprised Microsoft hasn't taken action yet.

428
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,140
Maybe they'll be good about this.

429
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,140
It really is a tribute.

430
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,660
Nobody is using this to make it rich selling copies.

431
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,700
It's a Windows 95 bundled in Electron app.

432
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,280
Yeah, it's a bit of computer history, isn't it really?

433
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,220
And it's a way to preserve that history.

434
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,700
I would like something for Linux, like early GNOME desktops and KDE desktops all wrapped

435
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,940
up in a system in an Electron app.

436
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,100
The idea is actually valid.

437
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,740
I don't know about a JavaScript virtual machine, maybe something else for the virtual machine.

438
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:25,940
But the idea itself as a way to revisit historical software, I think kind of works.

439
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,100
Yeah, but I would definitely disable the network because a lot of the old software is pretty

440
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,860
riddled with security holes.

441
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,300
No network and no access to the local file system by default.

442
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,300
Yeah, yeah.
