00:00.000 --> 00:16.560
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.560 --> 00:21.440
This is episode 92, recorded on February 10th, 2019.

00:21.440 --> 00:22.440
I'm Chris.

00:22.440 --> 00:23.440
And I'm Joe.

00:23.440 --> 00:24.440
Hello, Joe.

00:24.440 --> 00:30.200
And I assume you are reporting live on the scene this week from the brand new Raspberry

00:30.200 --> 00:32.200
Pi IRL store.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.460
Yeah, I should be really, shouldn't I?

00:34.460 --> 00:37.680
Because it's only about an hour's drive from my place.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.240
But no, I'm afraid I haven't visited this yet.

00:40.240 --> 00:44.080
It's in Cambridge, right in the center of town.

00:44.080 --> 00:50.280
And yeah, it's an actual bricks and mortar shop where they sell Raspberry Pis and books

00:50.280 --> 00:55.720
and accessories and everything Raspberry Pi, including the Babbage, their little mascot

00:55.720 --> 00:57.200
thing, the little cuddly toy.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.200
Well, that's good to know.

00:59.200 --> 01:03.040
Yeah, I gotta say, if there's one about an hour from me, I would probably visit.

01:03.040 --> 01:08.040
I like the idea of going in there and plugging a Raspberry Pi into a few accessories, building

01:08.040 --> 01:12.560
something and then buying a kit, taking it home and building the same thing at home.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.200
That is a neat idea.

01:14.200 --> 01:20.000
I do gotta kind of say, though, it reminds me of the Apple store.

01:20.000 --> 01:25.140
You've got the Raspberry Pi logo out front, lit up like the Apple logo, and then it's

01:25.140 --> 01:29.480
sort of a white with wood tables kind of look going.

01:29.480 --> 01:33.520
But at the same time, I would totally visit one if they had one nearby.

01:33.520 --> 01:37.000
Yeah, if parking wasn't such a nightmare in the town center, then I would have probably

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
gone up there by now.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
Yeah.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
And maybe I will at some point.

01:40.000 --> 01:47.960
But you do have to wonder why they've done this, though, because either they are expecting

01:47.960 --> 01:53.760
to make a lot of money selling this stuff, or they're willing to put a lot of money into

01:53.760 --> 01:54.760
it.

01:54.760 --> 01:58.880
Because retail spaces in this country, well, they always talk about the high street is

01:58.880 --> 02:00.920
dying, for example.

02:00.920 --> 02:06.860
It's very, very expensive to run a retail space in this country, and it has to be making

02:06.860 --> 02:09.840
a lot of money, otherwise you don't do it.

02:09.840 --> 02:12.960
But then again, they have got a lot of money to spend on this, maybe.

02:12.960 --> 02:13.960
I don't know.

02:13.960 --> 02:18.000
I don't really understand exactly the motivation for doing it.

02:18.000 --> 02:25.240
Any way you look at it, from like logistics, or money spent hiring, this is a massive investment.

02:25.240 --> 02:28.000
So there must be several really good reasons behind it.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.560
Not just one, but I would bet several.

02:31.560 --> 02:35.480
Reading their posts and kind of reading between the lines, they say things in here that I

02:35.480 --> 02:36.880
think kind of frame it up for us.

02:36.880 --> 02:37.880
Like here's an example.

02:37.880 --> 02:41.440
This is a quote from the raspberrypi.org post, which we'll have linked in the show notes.

02:41.440 --> 02:45.720
They write, explore some of the things you can do with a pie.

02:45.720 --> 02:51.760
Discover our accessories and books, and get your hands on store-only exclusives.

02:51.760 --> 02:54.760
Discover what you can do with a Raspberry Pi.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.520
That I think is a key sentence right there.

02:56.520 --> 02:59.060
Come explore some of these different opportunities.

02:59.060 --> 03:02.640
And I think what they're trying to say is, average people, you know, a mom that walks

03:02.640 --> 03:07.680
in with her son, or a dad that walks in with his daughter, can connect things up and build

03:07.680 --> 03:12.520
something and learn about something that if they weren't following tech circles online,

03:12.520 --> 03:14.680
they would otherwise be unaware of.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.600
I think that's the plan here.

03:16.600 --> 03:20.560
And they must see this as a big opportunity to make an investment like this.

03:20.560 --> 03:25.120
It feels like you'd need to have a lot of these shops everywhere for it to be a huge

03:25.120 --> 03:26.120
success.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.920
But I suppose they have to start from somewhere.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.960
And maybe they will gauge the success of this one.

03:30.960 --> 03:37.200
And if it does turn a profit for them, then maybe they will expand into other cities around

03:37.200 --> 03:38.200
the UK.

03:38.200 --> 03:43.280
And maybe they'll end up with this even bigger empire than they've already got.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.680
I'd love to see more of these stores.

03:44.680 --> 03:49.440
At the same time, I don't want to see the foundation's focus drift too far from the

03:49.440 --> 03:50.440
core mission.

03:50.440 --> 03:54.140
I'll give you a clear line for me.

03:54.140 --> 03:57.760
If they could launch three more stores, maybe one could even be like in the Seattle area

03:57.760 --> 03:59.800
or something like that.

03:59.800 --> 04:05.320
But it meant no Raspberry Pi 4 until 2021, I would definitely opt for the new Raspberry

04:05.320 --> 04:06.320
Pi 4.

04:06.320 --> 04:11.360
I want to have that sooner and have the foundation's focus there than on opening retail stores.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.340
That said, perhaps they can chew gum and walk at the same time.

04:14.340 --> 04:16.800
And I hope so because I'd love to see a few more of these.

04:16.800 --> 04:21.160
The idea would be way more powerful if they had a bigger presence.

04:21.160 --> 04:24.400
Well, one thing they're not going to have to worry about is cashing up at the end of

04:24.400 --> 04:26.520
the day because they're not going to take any cash.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.320
It's card only.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.320
Very modern.

04:29.320 --> 04:33.360
And I don't know how I feel about that really makes me feel like an old man.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.680
You only pay cash for stuff?

04:34.680 --> 04:41.320
Well, I'm not quite as bad a storeman, but I carry a bit of cash with me in just in case

04:41.320 --> 04:42.320
things go wrong.

04:42.320 --> 04:48.400
I remember there was a big outage maybe last year and I was at the supermarket and no one

04:48.400 --> 04:50.160
could pay for anything.

04:50.160 --> 04:53.200
And the cash machine, the ATM outside was empty.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.240
Obviously that happened within an hour or so.

04:56.240 --> 04:58.760
And everyone else was just not able to buy their stuff.

04:58.760 --> 05:03.200
But because I had a little bit of cash, I was able to buy the essentials and not rely

05:03.200 --> 05:04.200
on my card.

05:04.200 --> 05:08.680
So it's just a bit of a weird future for me where, you know, we moved to this cashless

05:08.680 --> 05:09.680
society.

05:09.680 --> 05:12.240
I mean, I do use my card most of the time, but it's just handy to have a little bit of

05:12.240 --> 05:13.240
cash there, I find.

05:13.240 --> 05:17.580
Joe, can I tell you about the good word around Bitcoin and just take a moment to tell you

05:17.580 --> 05:18.760
about the power of the blockchain?

05:18.760 --> 05:19.760
No, I kid.

05:19.760 --> 05:20.760
I do actually follow.

05:20.760 --> 05:25.960
In fact, I'd be a little sad if we went to an all electronic payments for everything

05:25.960 --> 05:27.360
society.

05:27.360 --> 05:32.880
That said, I also prefer to pay with my phone because I always forget my wallet, but I never

05:32.880 --> 05:34.200
forget my phone.

05:34.200 --> 05:38.200
And so just the pragmatist in me finds it appealing.

05:38.200 --> 05:43.340
I just wish we could have like a perfect world where it was a totally open source stack,

05:43.340 --> 05:46.320
like something that was maybe blockchain based.

05:46.320 --> 05:48.480
But that's not 2019.

05:48.480 --> 05:49.480
That's not happening now.

05:49.480 --> 05:55.480
And I think the Raspberry Pi folks are pretty clever in this because you save on a bunch

05:55.480 --> 05:58.720
of security issues holding cash on site.

05:58.720 --> 06:03.280
And for the things people are buying, that crowd probably has a form of electronic payment,

06:03.280 --> 06:05.920
be it a debit card, a credit card or even phone.

06:05.920 --> 06:06.920
Oh, yeah, definitely.

06:06.920 --> 06:10.480
I mean, the overhead, I mean, it costs money to pay cash into the bank.

06:10.480 --> 06:14.120
You've got to count it and it's easy for staff to steal it and stuff.

06:14.120 --> 06:18.360
If it's all just contactless payments and card payments, it's just much easier.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.280
So I totally understand why they do it, but I don't know.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.280
It does.

06:22.280 --> 06:23.880
It just makes me feel old, man.

06:23.880 --> 06:24.880
What can I say?

06:24.880 --> 06:28.200
Well, you might feel old, so let's talk about old school stuff for a moment.

06:28.200 --> 06:32.840
OpenOffice, I don't think we've ever mentioned it on the show before, but this week, LibreOffice

06:32.840 --> 06:36.520
and OpenOffice are vulnerable to the same bug.

06:36.520 --> 06:41.840
Only one of them has been patched and spoiler alert, it's not OpenOffice.

06:41.840 --> 06:47.200
Yeah, the fix came in very quickly for LibreOffice, so that has filtered down to the distros now.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.400
So there's very little chance that you're going to be vulnerable.

06:50.400 --> 06:56.520
And to be fair, the OpenOffice bug isn't quite as exploitable and potentially not as serious,

06:56.520 --> 07:00.960
but it does go to show that you should not be using OpenOffice.

07:00.960 --> 07:06.600
Now, I wouldn't imagine anybody listening to this is still using it, but I do often

07:06.600 --> 07:10.720
come across people who are still using OpenOffice because that was such a big brand.

07:10.720 --> 07:17.080
It was considered the free, as in beer, alternative to Microsoft Office for so long, and it's

07:17.080 --> 07:18.080
still around.

07:18.080 --> 07:21.960
You can still go and download and install it on Windows or Mac OS or whatever.

07:21.960 --> 07:28.020
And so a lot of people are still using it, and it's not being properly maintained.

07:28.020 --> 07:32.160
So I don't know what we do to get everyone to realize that they should move over to LibreOffice

07:32.160 --> 07:35.640
because that OpenOffice brand is so strong.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.680
This is why I have always stuck with StarOffice.

07:38.680 --> 07:44.700
No, I joke, but I do follow what you're saying, and I think there's no helping these people.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.640
These are the same people that are on Internet Explorer 6 and whatnot.

07:47.640 --> 07:51.360
I don't mean to be disparaging if you're one of them listening to the show.

07:51.360 --> 07:57.440
Maybe your corporate environment or educational environment mandates OpenOffice.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.620
If it is, email me, and I will advocate on your behalf.

08:00.620 --> 08:02.880
Let me know, chris at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

08:02.880 --> 08:07.320
But the reason why this has some momentum behind it is the Australian researcher that

08:07.320 --> 08:13.220
reported the vulnerability on Friday also included some proof of concept exploit code

08:13.220 --> 08:16.240
in his overall report.

08:16.240 --> 08:20.760
And the chief vulnerability exploited is a path traversal flaw that allowed the attack

08:20.760 --> 08:24.880
code to move out of its current directory and then jump into the one that contained

08:24.880 --> 08:30.560
sample Python scripts for LibreOffice or OpenOffice, depending on what you were using.

08:30.560 --> 08:36.040
And once in there, they could use another vulnerability to take over the machine.

08:36.040 --> 08:40.800
And essentially, the user had very minimal interaction to trigger this, which is really

08:40.800 --> 08:41.800
the concern.

08:41.800 --> 08:44.620
Now, like Joe said, LibreOffice developers were all over it.

08:44.620 --> 08:49.680
They fixed this in version 6.1.4.2 and 6.0.7.

08:49.680 --> 08:54.040
And of course, in version 6.2, which has just come out as a feature release.

08:54.040 --> 09:00.120
With that major new headline, the brand new notebook bar, which is a new, as they say,

09:00.120 --> 09:02.840
radical approach to the user interface.

09:02.840 --> 09:07.440
And it provides different options for how you might like the toolbar laid out from

09:07.440 --> 09:13.100
the traditional standards kind of style to a sort of a tabbed browser look to something

09:13.100 --> 09:19.080
that is somewhat familiar to the Microsoft ribbon, which they call grouped.

09:19.080 --> 09:22.600
I actually like that one the most trying them all out myself.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.600
And it's not bad, Joe.

09:25.600 --> 09:29.080
I hate to be the one here to get a little hype on the LibreOffice because usually I'm

09:29.080 --> 09:34.280
the one that downplays the LibreOffice stories traditionally because it's kind of boring.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.680
It's great software, but it's kind of boring.

09:36.680 --> 09:42.000
Having used it for the weekend, I might just do all of my writing now in LibreOffice Writer.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
It's pretty good.

09:43.000 --> 09:48.440
Well, I installed it on Ubuntu by just downloading the tar file with all of the devs and just

09:48.440 --> 09:55.720
doing the dpkg install star.deb, and I was quite surprised that it just worked perfectly.

09:55.720 --> 09:59.840
And when I opened it, I thought, well, hang on, isn't there supposed to be something different

09:59.840 --> 10:00.840
about this?

10:00.840 --> 10:04.840
And then I actually went and read the post and, oh, you have to enable it, which I think

10:04.840 --> 10:07.320
is a good move at this stage.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.280
Don't just shock people with a new UI.

10:10.280 --> 10:13.120
Make it trivial for them to turn it on and off.

10:13.120 --> 10:17.240
But if you don't want this, then it's not going to be a problem for you, at least for

10:17.240 --> 10:19.520
now because nothing has changed by default.

10:19.520 --> 10:20.520
I agree.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.680
Having these new toolbars off by default, I think it was a pretty good move because

10:23.680 --> 10:27.440
they don't feel 100% baked to me.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.100
None of them have really clicked.

10:29.100 --> 10:32.260
They all have kind of like small little issues.

10:32.260 --> 10:37.400
Everything but the standard toolbar has essentially a hamburger menu, but they don't call it that

10:37.400 --> 10:40.000
and they don't use the hamburger menu icon.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.720
It's just like a little down arrow or in some cases it says menu.

10:43.720 --> 10:47.660
And in different layouts, there's different stuff in that menu and there's different areas

10:47.660 --> 10:51.440
you go to even change the layout depending on which layout you use.

10:51.440 --> 10:59.080
There's just stuff in there that it's not 100% done, but it's like 90, 95% done.

10:59.080 --> 11:02.360
And so I think leaving it off by default, but letting people opt into it, try it out

11:02.360 --> 11:06.600
and give feedback and then another release cycle or two, then they can pick one and stick

11:06.600 --> 11:07.600
to it.

11:07.600 --> 11:12.440
But this is all about making the transition from proprietary office suites easier.

11:12.440 --> 11:16.640
Now I must admit, I haven't used Microsoft Office for years.

11:16.640 --> 11:22.080
I've used Google Docs extensively and I've used LibreOffice, so I'm not really in a great

11:22.080 --> 11:23.360
position to compare.

11:23.360 --> 11:28.640
Have you used Microsoft Office enough to know whether this will aid the transition?

11:28.640 --> 11:32.240
Oh for sure, yeah, absolutely.

11:32.240 --> 11:36.440
Especially for those that are coming from the standard desktop versions of Microsoft

11:36.440 --> 11:41.320
Office and don't want to necessarily make a leap to a subscription cloud version or

11:41.320 --> 11:44.400
just tired of paying the upgrade license cycle.

11:44.400 --> 11:50.820
And one of the important things about this release is they have greatly improved interoperability

11:50.820 --> 11:52.880
with proprietary file formats once again.

11:52.880 --> 11:57.140
I mean they do this every release, but just like all those previous releases, they've

11:57.140 --> 11:59.080
done a lot more work again.

11:59.080 --> 12:03.960
And one of the things I think is great about LibreOffice is they've specifically put work

12:03.960 --> 12:09.520
into supporting old Microsoft formats that Microsoft is no longer supporting.

12:09.520 --> 12:13.920
Which if you think about it, long term, that's the real strength of an open source project

12:13.920 --> 12:14.920
like this.

12:14.920 --> 12:18.640
They can just for years work on improving that compatibility after Microsoft leaves

12:18.640 --> 12:20.200
those users way behind.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.640
Yeah, which is a very serious problem.

12:22.640 --> 12:28.160
A few years ago I dug out an old computer that my dad had done some writing on and that

12:28.160 --> 12:29.600
had a SCSI hard drive in it.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.700
That tells you how old that was.

12:31.700 --> 12:37.000
And managed to hook it up and I can't remember exactly how I managed to read the Clarisse

12:37.000 --> 12:43.440
Works docs that were on there, but I managed to convert them and I've got them I think

12:43.440 --> 12:45.440
in ODT now.

12:45.440 --> 12:50.280
And that is a prime example of data that is just locked up in this proprietary format

12:50.280 --> 12:52.900
that you otherwise can't access.

12:52.900 --> 12:57.720
And yeah, as you say, the beauty of an open source project is that they can do up resources

12:57.720 --> 13:04.720
to this and potentially keep that data alive and valuable for a lot longer than a company

13:04.720 --> 13:06.160
like Microsoft would.

13:06.160 --> 13:10.840
This release gave me an opportunity to look at LibreOffice in a new light.

13:10.840 --> 13:16.020
When you combine their new look that they have and the fact that I run so many stinking

13:16.020 --> 13:19.560
Electron apps now that my bar has just shifted.

13:19.560 --> 13:26.720
LibreOffice is like a lightweight efficient app with tons of features compared to my Electron

13:26.720 --> 13:27.720
apps.

13:27.720 --> 13:31.640
And in the past when I used LibreOffice it was like this huge application that took all

13:31.640 --> 13:37.520
of this memory and that all now has completely shifted when I look at how much RAM these

13:37.520 --> 13:39.120
Electron editors take.

13:39.120 --> 13:44.440
And so I'm sitting here using a native Linux application with a great spell checker, incredible

13:44.440 --> 13:50.440
file format compatibility, a great editor and a new modern look on the UI.

13:50.440 --> 13:55.060
And I'm just left a little disappointed and a little frustrated that the project isn't

13:55.060 --> 13:56.720
treating Linux users better.

13:56.720 --> 14:01.960
And I appreciate that they probably have exponentially more users on Windows and a lot more users

14:01.960 --> 14:03.440
on Mac OS.

14:03.440 --> 14:09.660
But throw us a bone that there's so many ways you could do a better job at packaging for

14:09.660 --> 14:15.000
Linux that it's ridiculous you're not stepping up at least in one avenue.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.440
Now the folks over at Flathub have you covered.

14:18.440 --> 14:25.360
You can get the brand new latest version of LibreOffice 6.2.03 that they have, the Flathub

14:25.360 --> 14:28.960
maintainers have packaged up on behalf of LibreOffice.

14:28.960 --> 14:34.760
Or you can go get a snap that the snap maintainers, the snap craft folks are packaging up on behalf

14:34.760 --> 14:36.040
of LibreOffice.

14:36.040 --> 14:40.900
But if you want to install it on your own Linux box like Joe mentioned, you got to download

14:40.900 --> 14:47.020
a tar file that extracts out into several directories with some archaic install script

14:47.020 --> 14:51.720
or a directory full of RPMs or devs depending on which distribution you choose.

14:51.720 --> 14:52.720
And good luck.

14:52.720 --> 14:53.720
Good luck.

14:53.720 --> 14:54.720
You know what?

14:54.720 --> 14:55.720
Let's do it.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.440
Because for some of us, it works just fine.

14:57.440 --> 14:59.400
And for others, it breaks like hell.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.240
You end up having multiple icons on your system.

15:02.240 --> 15:05.400
I installed this on an Ubuntu system and a Fedora system.

15:05.400 --> 15:08.540
And I got different results both times.

15:08.540 --> 15:11.260
And I can't help but think they could do a much better job.

15:11.260 --> 15:12.720
They can make an app image.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.680
They could maintain a Flatpak themselves.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.320
And they have Flatpak documentation on their website.

15:17.320 --> 15:20.920
And it's embarrassingly out of date.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.560
There's no excuse for it.

15:22.560 --> 15:25.480
I appreciate that they have more Windows users.

15:25.480 --> 15:30.840
But the reality is, they may have one of the most competitive editors on Linux right now.

15:30.840 --> 15:34.200
Man, if they put Markdown support into this thing, it'd be next level.

15:34.200 --> 15:37.880
In fact, if anybody in the audience knows how to get Markdown support in LibreOffice

15:37.880 --> 15:40.000
at Chris Ellis, me on Twitter, I'd love to know.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.040
I mean, really, it's close there.

15:42.040 --> 15:45.840
Because comparing it to all of the other heavy editors now, it's got a lot of competitive

15:45.840 --> 15:49.080
options, especially when you add the new file compatibility stuff.

15:49.080 --> 15:53.400
I would just love to see them be a little more competitive on how it gets distributed.

15:53.400 --> 15:57.480
And a big tip of the hat and thank you to the Flathub maintainers and to the staff at

15:57.480 --> 16:01.160
Canonical that are packaging up and staffing Flatpaks for those of us that want to try

16:01.160 --> 16:05.680
this on our system without breaking it by installing 15 different RPMs.

16:05.680 --> 16:10.320
The Snap's still on the 6.1 branch at the moment, but I would imagine that that will

16:10.320 --> 16:11.880
get updated this week.

16:11.880 --> 16:15.680
Well, that's the problem when somebody has to volunteer their time to package it.

16:15.680 --> 16:21.800
If LibreOffice was snapping it up directly themselves, then we wouldn't have this problem.

16:21.800 --> 16:25.080
And that's why I say thank you to the folks at Canonical, they're doing it because we

16:25.080 --> 16:26.080
wouldn't have it otherwise.

16:26.080 --> 16:30.360
Yeah, although a lot of people won't actually use 6.2 for quite a while until it turns up

16:30.360 --> 16:32.960
in their distro's repos.

16:32.960 --> 16:37.720
I won't be using it day to day because I don't really need those features right now.

16:37.720 --> 16:41.800
And maybe when I upgrade to 20.04, it'll be in there.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.400
So I think that it's more relevant on the Windows side, really.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.400
Right.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.400
I agree.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.800
I mean, most users will just get it when their distribution refreshes.

16:50.800 --> 16:56.880
However, if you took a lifelong Mac user or Windows user and told them that they weren't

16:56.880 --> 17:00.220
going to get the next version of their Office suite until they upgraded their operating

17:00.220 --> 17:02.720
system, they would laugh in your face.

17:02.720 --> 17:08.720
So while I agree it works, and from a practical standpoint, it's perfectly functional, but

17:08.720 --> 17:10.320
it really feels out of date.

17:10.320 --> 17:14.680
In a modern marketplace, it just seems super antiquated.

17:14.680 --> 17:20.040
Well, it's almost as antiquated as the Android security situation.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.040
Everything's fine unless you view a PNG.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.440
I mean, what's the big deal?

17:22.440 --> 17:26.400
You just innocently view a PNG on your device and you get owned.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.400
Why is that a problem?

17:27.400 --> 17:30.680
Well, it's a problem because almost no one is actually going to get a patch for this.

17:30.680 --> 17:35.480
Well, maybe that's harsh, but a lot of devices out there will never be patched against this

17:35.480 --> 17:36.480
vulnerability.

17:36.480 --> 17:40.640
The way you'll know you're secure is if it says you have the February 2019 patches.

17:40.640 --> 17:44.880
If you don't have that, then you kind of have a problem because the most serious of what

17:44.880 --> 17:49.400
are several vulnerabilities that got patched is this PNG vulnerability where you're just

17:49.400 --> 17:55.200
viewing a PNG image, like in an email, on a webpage, in a chat app, whatever it is,

17:55.200 --> 18:00.000
you can actually have malicious code smuggled in that PNG image and the viewer on Android,

18:00.000 --> 18:03.000
if it's using the system viewer, will render it.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.160
So not all applications, but many of them.

18:05.160 --> 18:09.840
A few other holes in there, one of them involving Bluetooth signal handling, which even just

18:09.840 --> 18:14.560
a malicious Bluetooth signal can own your rig.

18:14.560 --> 18:19.280
But I think out of everything in this list, that PNG one is definitely the worst.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.080
The ping file, I guess some people call it a ping file, Joe.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.240
I have never called it that.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.840
I've heard it called that, but it's a PNG.

18:25.840 --> 18:26.840
Thank you very much.

18:26.840 --> 18:27.840
Thank you.

18:27.840 --> 18:31.880
Now, I was all set to be smug about this with lineage running on my phone and I've been

18:31.880 --> 18:33.880
doing the daily updates.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.440
I normally do them every week or so, but I've been doing them every day to try and get up

18:37.440 --> 18:42.800
to the February patch level and no, I did it today and still 5th of January, 2019.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.020
So I am still vulnerable.

18:45.020 --> 18:49.240
So even lineage on a OnePlus 3T is vulnerable.

18:49.240 --> 18:53.240
Yeah, but as we record, we're only 10 days into the month, so I'm sure pretty soon you'll

18:53.240 --> 18:54.240
have it, Joe.

18:54.240 --> 18:59.200
And you know, it's not all doom and gloom because there's ASLR built into Android, which

18:59.200 --> 19:01.620
will sort a lot of exploits like this.

19:01.620 --> 19:07.700
So there is mitigation technologies and I don't see any reports in the wild yet.

19:07.700 --> 19:09.600
So there is time for the patches to land.

19:09.600 --> 19:15.760
Yeah, but it does potentially impact at least half of all Android devices that are still

19:15.760 --> 19:22.120
active and maybe even more than that because it may go far back beyond Android 7.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.220
It could go several versions beyond that.

19:24.220 --> 19:25.220
We just don't know.

19:25.220 --> 19:29.320
There's not much information about this specifically from Google at the moment, which is a bit

19:29.320 --> 19:30.840
of a shame really.

19:30.840 --> 19:36.840
It'd be nice to have some clarity on exactly what is vulnerable, but I suppose it pretty

19:36.840 --> 19:40.160
much goes without saying that if you've got an old version of Android that isn't being

19:40.160 --> 19:44.080
patched, then you're going to be vulnerable to a lot more than just this.

19:44.080 --> 19:50.920
Yeah, that is so often sort of the ending note for a story like this and it really drives

19:50.920 --> 19:52.520
me crazy.

19:52.520 --> 19:56.300
I feel like this is a much, much bigger problem than it gets recognition for.

19:56.300 --> 20:01.420
So anybody on Android 5, for example, which is still a very, very popular version of Android,

20:01.420 --> 20:02.760
you're not getting a patch.

20:02.760 --> 20:09.100
And if you have a Qualcomm chip in your Android device, there's 19 security screw-ups in this

20:09.100 --> 20:15.140
February patch alone that fix driver issues for Qualcomm chipsets.

20:15.140 --> 20:19.760
If you're not getting these patches and you have a Qualcomm chip, you're vulnerable.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.920
And that's just the hard math of it and it drives me crazy that this still is allowed

20:23.920 --> 20:30.400
to exist, that they have this slow solution, Project Treble, and encouraging the Linux

20:30.400 --> 20:35.020
community to have much longer support windows for the kernels and it's a very, very, very

20:35.020 --> 20:36.020
slow burn.

20:36.020 --> 20:38.720
And when you look at how long it takes this stuff to roll out to Android, it makes this

20:38.720 --> 20:43.840
next story sort of anticlimactic because what we're about to talk about won't even land

20:43.840 --> 20:50.040
until Linux 5.0 and who knows how long that'll take to get out to Android handsets.

20:50.040 --> 20:57.680
Yeah, this is Adiantum, which is encryption for low-end Android Go devices as essentially

20:57.680 --> 21:02.280
an alternative to spec, which we talked about towards the end of last year, which was the

21:02.280 --> 21:06.120
one that originally came from the NSA and didn't hang around in the kernel for very

21:06.120 --> 21:07.120
long.

21:07.120 --> 21:08.120
Right.

21:08.120 --> 21:11.220
Spec was pulled from the Linux kernel in 4.20 just simply because nobody wanted to step

21:11.220 --> 21:12.220
up to maintain it.

21:12.220 --> 21:16.080
That didn't make it very long.

21:16.080 --> 21:20.680
So I think this is actually, in a sense, not like the true meaning of the word, but in

21:20.680 --> 21:23.580
a sense, it's more competing with AES.

21:23.580 --> 21:28.240
Android offers storage encryption using advanced encryption standard, which is AES.

21:28.240 --> 21:35.360
Most new Android devices have hardware support for AES via the ARM version 8 cryptography

21:35.360 --> 21:40.360
extension, which means accelerated hardware decryption for AES.

21:40.360 --> 21:45.520
That's most Android devices, but not all, like the Android Go devices, which are in

21:45.520 --> 21:51.640
developing countries, and Android Wear devices, and all the other kind of random devices that

21:51.640 --> 21:56.560
Android happens to run on that still need data protection but don't have hardware-accelerated

21:56.560 --> 21:57.560
AES decryption.

21:57.560 --> 22:02.240
Now, my first thought was, hmm, what about performance?

22:02.240 --> 22:08.040
Because with my Nexus 9, I had to disable encryption because it was just useless with

22:08.040 --> 22:10.440
encryption enabled.

22:10.440 --> 22:16.880
So that was my biggest concern, but it looks like this will be fairly efficient.

22:16.880 --> 22:21.440
But there will still be a bit of a performance hit, which does matter on these low-end devices.

22:21.440 --> 22:25.320
The performance thing they're pulling off here is particularly neat, and it has to do

22:25.320 --> 22:29.760
with block sizes, and how they're doing the encryption, and how they stream that to the

22:29.760 --> 22:33.440
decryption system, and all of that, which we all have linked to the show notes.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.440
But a couple of things to note about this.

22:35.440 --> 22:39.000
Number one, one of the core goals behind the project was to find a way to encrypt file

22:39.000 --> 22:45.280
system data on low-end devices, and then be able to decrypt it very quickly without annoying

22:45.280 --> 22:50.920
the end user, or, very importantly, negatively impacting the battery.

22:50.920 --> 22:52.640
So that was their benchmark.

22:52.640 --> 22:56.120
But the other thing to note is this isn't limited just to Android.

22:56.120 --> 23:01.280
It's going to be mainlined in 5.0, so it will be available via DMCrypt, and it'll be on

23:01.280 --> 23:02.280
Linux systems.

23:02.280 --> 23:05.440
It'll be an option for Linux users to secure their file system.

23:05.440 --> 23:10.080
Yeah, so it sounds good in theory, but I think I would have to see it in action, and almost

23:10.080 --> 23:14.560
compare side by side to see whether or not there is that performance and battery, as

23:14.560 --> 23:15.560
you say, impact.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.280
Hopefully, they've got it sussed.

23:17.280 --> 23:18.280
I agree.

23:18.280 --> 23:21.120
Whenever you're messing with your data, you have to be very careful.

23:21.120 --> 23:24.480
Not only do you need to have backups, but you need to do your own measures.

23:24.480 --> 23:27.000
Measure twice, cut once on this kind of stuff.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.880
But it is worth noting that it's not a new encryption algorithm as such.

23:30.880 --> 23:37.520
Instead, it's a repackaging of the cha-cha stream cipher that makes it useful for disk

23:37.520 --> 23:38.520
encryption.

23:38.520 --> 23:44.120
So we're dealing with repackaging existing technologies here, and this whole system was

23:44.120 --> 23:50.120
in development before spec was even proposed as a faster-to-deploy solution.

23:50.120 --> 23:53.320
So it's been in the works for longer than it may seem.

23:53.320 --> 23:59.600
Naturally, though, development did hit a faster pace when spec didn't really work out.

23:59.600 --> 24:02.840
The developers realized where that was going, like, this is our chance.

24:02.840 --> 24:07.640
But they've been working on this for a long time, and it's not a new fundamental encryption

24:07.640 --> 24:08.740
system they're using here.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.880
It's just a repackaging of existing, safe encryption standards.

24:11.880 --> 24:15.760
Yeah, well, the first rule of crypto is don't roll your own crypto.

24:15.760 --> 24:16.760
Telegram.

24:16.760 --> 24:23.940
Yeah, use existing technologies, ideally open-source ones, so that gets a thumbs up straight away.

24:23.940 --> 24:28.160
Our last story for the day brings a big smile to my face, because long-time Linux users

24:28.160 --> 24:34.280
know that whenever a new advanced fancy-pants video codec was in the works, there's a few

24:34.280 --> 24:37.120
things about it that were immediately turned off for Linux users.

24:37.120 --> 24:43.180
It usually incorporated some kind of crazy DRM, it was patented like crazy, and it wasn't

24:43.180 --> 24:45.320
available to Linux users.

24:45.320 --> 24:48.580
And us Linux users would just sit back and go, yeah, yeah, have your crazy great video

24:48.580 --> 24:50.040
codecs.

24:50.040 --> 24:53.080
That, Joe, is no longer true.

24:53.080 --> 24:58.520
In fact, things have really shifted in video codecs and audio codecs over the years.

24:58.520 --> 25:02.640
For those of you that don't know, a lot of the patents and encumbranments around MP3

25:02.640 --> 25:06.740
have finally, finally faded away.

25:06.740 --> 25:11.640
But we still have all these issues around H.264, the most common video codec on the

25:11.640 --> 25:12.640
web.

25:12.640 --> 25:18.440
But Intel is hoping to encourage the adoption of a future codec that is royalty-free.

25:18.440 --> 25:26.080
Yeah, AoMedia Video 1, or AV1 for short, which has been gaining quite a lot of momentum recently.

25:26.080 --> 25:32.320
And there's a great talk on YouTube from linuxconf.au, which we can link in the show notes, from Timothy

25:32.320 --> 25:39.680
B. Terabury, I think you say his name, explaining just why AV1 is a great codec, apart from

25:39.680 --> 25:41.120
being royalty-free.

25:41.120 --> 25:44.120
But even technically, it's just a next-generation codec.

25:44.120 --> 25:48.200
It's a very in-depth talk, but it's well worth watching.

25:48.200 --> 25:53.120
But one of the problems that they had up until recently is that although decoding was very

25:53.120 --> 25:58.320
quick, the actual encoding of the video in the first place was fairly slow.

25:58.320 --> 26:06.560
And what Intel have done now is released, as open source, SVT AV1, which is their CPU-based

26:06.560 --> 26:08.120
encoding software tool.

26:08.120 --> 26:10.560
Let's make sure we understand what we're talking about hardware here.

26:10.560 --> 26:11.800
We're talking about hardware here.

26:11.800 --> 26:18.060
You're gonna need a Skylight generation or newer Xeon processor with at least 112 threads

26:18.060 --> 26:24.960
that has at least 48 gigabytes of RAM if you want to do 10-bit color space 4K video encoding.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.600
Requirements go down from there.

26:26.600 --> 26:31.560
But when you hear about how Linux is used in video production, imagine yourself a room

26:31.560 --> 26:37.260
full of rack-mount Linux boxes with tons of CPUs in them and RAM that are encoding videos

26:37.260 --> 26:39.600
like this for Hollywood studio machines.

26:39.600 --> 26:43.480
This is where Linux excels in video production, is when you need a ton of horsepower, you

26:43.480 --> 26:47.400
need to send your video job into something to really chew through it, you just can't

26:47.400 --> 26:49.160
beat the economics of Linux.

26:49.160 --> 26:53.360
But even as a publisher, on a much smaller scale than that, it is nice to know that there's

26:53.360 --> 27:00.240
this royalty-free codec that can be baked into open source software.

27:00.240 --> 27:04.120
And although it's early days at the moment, it'd be nice to see a lot of sites supporting

27:04.120 --> 27:06.040
this and just pushing it forward.

27:06.040 --> 27:11.120
And I think that Intel's move here might make that a reality sooner rather than later.

27:11.120 --> 27:15.200
Well, the support is looking really good on the playback side, Chrome, Firefox, all those

27:15.200 --> 27:21.880
current versions have support, MPV, VLC, they have support, FFmpeg nightlies have support,

27:21.880 --> 27:24.280
so it's going to be coming to Handbrake very soon.

27:24.280 --> 27:28.160
But this is all kind of CPU-based now.

27:28.160 --> 27:33.000
But about a year from now, Intel says we're going to be seeing actual hardware encoders

27:33.000 --> 27:38.240
that can churn out video in the AV1 codec much, much faster.

27:38.240 --> 27:42.880
So this isn't a long-term solution, this is like for people that want to deal with high-resolution

27:42.880 --> 27:46.860
video right now and distribute it at incredibly small file sizes.

27:46.860 --> 27:51.360
This is something you can do, but in about a year, it could be baked into chips for a

27:51.360 --> 27:52.360
lot of us.

27:52.360 --> 27:56.420
Yeah, and anything that gets us away from patents and royalties and all of that horrible

27:56.420 --> 28:02.040
mess has got to be good, so I'm really hoping that this works out as a new industry standard.

28:02.040 --> 28:09.040
Yeah, really, H.264 has been great, and X.264, technically amazing.

28:09.040 --> 28:12.240
Blackmagic, having worked in video for many years, I am so impressed.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.880
I'm also ready to move on.

28:14.880 --> 28:19.600
AV1 looks even better, it's royalty-free, it's just going to be a process.

28:19.600 --> 28:23.440
Early support is there, but we just have to wait and see where this goes.

28:23.440 --> 28:28.880
And if something interesting develops with this or any story in Linux or the open-source

28:28.880 --> 28:30.560
world, we'll cover it.

28:30.560 --> 28:35.000
Go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.680
And go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

28:38.680 --> 28:43.580
And if you're well-networked in the open-source world, Linux Academy is hiring an instructor

28:43.580 --> 28:50.680
recruiter to help us grow the training architect team here from around 30 people to 100 people.

28:50.680 --> 28:54.560
Our students have high expectations and they want to add a ton of more content and need

28:54.560 --> 28:58.560
to hire a lot more people, but we need somebody that can put us in touch with great people.

28:58.560 --> 29:01.640
If that's you, linuxacademy.com slash careers.

29:01.640 --> 29:05.800
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open-source news.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.520
I'm at Chris LAS.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.960
I'm at Joel Ressington.

29:08.960 --> 29:12.040
Thank you for joining us and we will see you next week.

29:12.040 --> 29:38.160
Until then, have a great day.
