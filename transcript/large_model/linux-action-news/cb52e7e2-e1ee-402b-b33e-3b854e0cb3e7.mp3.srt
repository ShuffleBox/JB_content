00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 196, recorded on July 5th, 2021.

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,800
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,800
Well, hello, Wes.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,840
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,800
System76 has released PapaWes 2104 with their new COSMIC desktop.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,760
COSMIC, which System76 says stands for Computer Operating System Main Interface Components,

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,480
has their new experience on top of the GNOME Shell.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,420
I like that backronym there.

10
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,420
That's a good one.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,800
Computer Operating System Main Interface Components.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,360
System76 says the COSMIC desktop is the result of user feedback that they collected from

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,600
various sources and polling Pop OS users, and it has been designed to be compatible

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,280
with GNOME Shell 338.

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,480
So in theory, it's portable to other distributions with the correct dependencies.

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,720
As the name implies, Pop OS 2104 itself is based on Ubuntu 2104, so that means it includes

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,320
the Linux 5.11 kernel and all the goodies of that general Ubuntu release.

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,600
What's the new experience like?

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,520
Well, COSMIC uses a dock on the bottom of the screen by default.

20
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,900
You may not love that it takes up the entire bottom of the screen by default, actually,

21
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,200
but there's a little toggle if you want the more minimal version.

22
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,040
Also quite notably, it separates GNOME's activities overview into individually accessible

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,520
workspace and application screens, and does that quite prominently, both with icons in

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,840
that new dock and with some stuff up in the top bar.

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,380
So I think this is a feature they want people to try and to play with.

26
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,080
And notably, they're vertical workspaces, too.

27
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,080
Indeed.

28
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,760
And for you keyboard warriors out there, there's also a new keyboard-centric app launcher.

29
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,520
They need a good name for that that doesn't sound like Launch because their actual keyboard

30
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,520
is called Launch.

31
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
I'm confused already.

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,000
I mean, they have a keyboard-driven app launcher, but it's pretty great.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,600
When you first install Pop, one of the things that I like now with the COSMIC layer on top

34
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,000
is you get a couple additional setup questions that are really easy to go through.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,480
And anything that you decide right there in the beginning can easily be found in GNOME

36
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,520
system settings later if you change your mind.

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,040
Like for example, I tried the full bar down at the bottom, but ultimately I decided I

38
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,200
wanted it on the side of my screen and I didn't want it to go end to end.

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,200
I just wanted it to take up as much space as the icons required.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,840
And I just kind of took a guess as to where that might be in GNOME system settings.

41
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,160
And it was exactly where I expected it to be.

42
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,200
And it was really simple to change that.

43
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,560
But that launcher you mentioned, Wes, that is special.

44
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,080
This might be one of my favorite launchers I've ever used.

45
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,560
When you tap that super key, it pops right up, faster than when you would say traditionally

46
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,060
see the GNOME overview come up.

47
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,080
And then they have truly instant search results.

48
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,360
So as you begin typing the application, like you'd expect, it starts giving you answers.

49
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,520
Each answer has a control plus a number that you can tap and it'll immediately execute

50
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,080
that application.

51
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,560
And you can do a lot of the things that I love with KRunner on Plasma, but now you can

52
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,040
do it on a GNOME-based desktop, which is nice because they've done a really good job

53
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,680
implementing it.

54
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,720
Along with that, they've done a fantastic job of integrating gestures into the cosmic

55
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
experience.

56
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,260
You can swipe four fingers right on the trackpad to open the applications overview.

57
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,760
If you swipe four fingers left, it opens up the workspace overview.

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,680
Four fingers down, you can go to a different workspace.

59
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,880
Three fingers to switch between open applications.

60
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,400
There's several gestures in there that you can work with.

61
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,960
And then, of course, baked in as well is their latest iteration of their tiling extension,

62
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,400
which sits in a pretty good sweet spot for me.

63
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,400
My only kind of complaint with it is I wish I could just turn it on for certain workspaces.

64
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,600
If I could have like tiling on workspace two and three, but workspace one was free floating

65
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,320
or something like that, oh, man, that'd be the sweet spot.

66
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,320
And maybe it'll get there one day.

67
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,480
Yeah, I think it's still pretty early days for Cosmic.

68
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,120
And its design choices and the way it works, I think, means there's some upsides and downsides.

69
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,720
I really like that it's just a set of components that you can kind of have on or off individually

70
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,120
and you could bring to your own desktops.

71
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,580
But that does mean, you know, they're just building on top of GNOME, and I think that

72
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,780
constrains and limits quite everything that they might be able to do, at least so far.

73
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,520
It's especially nice to see that multi-touch gesture support you mentioned, because one

74
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:24,240
thing that is quite notably missing from this release is GNOME 40, and especially some of

75
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,560
that GTK4 GPU acceleration that we've come to love.

76
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,680
But again, that's something that's somewhat constrained based on how Pop!

77
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
OS works, right?

78
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,800
It's building on top of Ubuntu, and you kind of wait for Ubuntu to catch up first.

79
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
Yeah.

80
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,800
And I suppose the idea might be get this built now while they're in the pre-LTS phase, and

81
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,840
maybe it's easier to bring it to GNOME 40 than wait.

82
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,840
Right.

83
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,200
This is, in many ways, the time you have to flesh all this out, figure it out, and it's

84
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,540
easy to criticize something that's new.

85
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,960
We do plenty of that.

86
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,340
But sometimes you do have to put something out there before you can really start making

87
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,420
it better.

88
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,480
But even with the warts it has, I think Pop!

89
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,400
OS is starting to feel like its own unique experience.

90
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,700
There's a bit of a question there, right?

91
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,000
Because isn't it just Ubuntu and GNOME?

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,080
But when you sit down in front of Pop!

93
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,080
OS 2104, it feels like something all its own.

94
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,040
Although if GNOME Shell in general isn't your thing, well, I don't think Cosmic will

95
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,040
likely be for you.

96
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,680
But if you're a Linux desktop nerd, it's definitely worth a look.

97
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,960
And be sure to tune into recent episodes of Coder Radio for ongoing coverage of using

98
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,720
Pop and Cosmic as a development workstation.

99
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,440
Speaking of us long-time desktop Linux nerds, we've been reeling over what's happening

100
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
to Audacity.

101
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,040
You may have noticed there's a pitchfork shortage this week.

102
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,080
That's because the Muse group that now owns Audacity has got everyone upset again.

103
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,760
Now, if you're not familiar with what I'm talking about, it all starts about two months

104
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
ago.

105
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,440
Audacity was acquired by the Muse group.

106
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,940
They're known for their MuseScore app.

107
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,680
They also run the Ultimate Guitar website.

108
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,200
Since their purchase of Audacity, they have introduced a data collection policy that greatly

109
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,740
upset the community.

110
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,720
They introduced a CLA that had vague justification and was also quite alarming.

111
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,980
And this week, things really came to a peak.

112
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,980
Some headlines have summed it up as Audacity is now spyware.

113
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,960
But of course, the truth really lies somewhere in between.

114
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,080
In a privacy notice update, the Muse group outlined what users can expect in Audacity

115
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
3.0.3.

116
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:38,560
The multinational company updated the policy stating they collect OS version, user IP,

117
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:45,680
CPU, error messages, and, quote, any data necessary for law enforcement.

118
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,080
As to who those law enforcement agencies might be, their policy reads,

119
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,840
All your data is stored on our servers in the European Economic Area, however, we are

120
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,000
occasionally required to share your personal data with our main office in Russia and our

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,440
external counsel in the USA.

122
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,600
Additionally, they state that they might share your data with anyone they classify as a third

123
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,480
party, advisors, or potential buyers.

124
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:19,600
That same page contains a boilerplate attempt to prevent kids under the age of 13 from using

125
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,320
Audacity in their privacy policy, which, in my opinion, is a violation of the GPL.

126
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:30,400
As you would expect, however, somehow surprising to the Muse group, there were a lot of angry

127
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,100
reactions all over the open source community.

128
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,240
Users on GitHub and Reddit and many other places are calling to fork Audacity, which

129
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,360
seems like it's actually picking up traction.

130
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,800
We're probably going to see one of these actually gain adoption, which we'll keep an eye on

131
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
for you.

132
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,920
Yeah, really, this entire privacy policy reads kind of just like some legal boilerplate,

133
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,600
you know, something that might be considered perfectly normal, or at least, you know, what

134
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,680
you see day to day in the commercial software world.

135
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,120
But of course, that kind of stuff is deemed pretty invasive and rude in the free software

136
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,680
community.

137
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,080
Especially since Audacity represented a set of ideas and philosophies about software,

138
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,880
how that software should respect its users, who that software is for.

139
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:19,520
From what it looks like on the outside, the Muse group doesn't really seem to get that.

140
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,880
As we record on this Monday morning, Daniel Ray, the head of strategy at the Muse group,

141
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:30,160
posted a clarification of the privacy policy and essentially confirmed the boilerplate

142
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,040
nature of the language, and said he believed the strong reaction was due largely to unclear

143
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,000
phrasing in the privacy policy.

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,960
Yeah, and then he goes on to say that they are in the process of rectifying that, and

145
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,960
he makes some solid attempts to walk back the harshness of the language in the privacy

146
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:50,240
policy and tries to put context around the term personal data and its relation to the

147
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,680
GDPR.

148
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,720
What I don't read in there is any correction or update regarding the age restriction of

149
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,820
Audacity.

150
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,960
And again, in my opinion, that's possibly a GPL violation.

151
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,640
It would be nice to have seen them address that since a GPL violation could be a pretty

152
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,320
big deal, especially if they managed to do one in two months of owning the thing.

153
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,720
Well, the other part too, I think, is whether or not it is violating the letter of the GPL

154
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,880
or exactly which version of the software this applies to, since it's on their actual website

155
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,280
and not the GitHub repository, at least to my knowledge.

156
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:24,840
It certainly violates the spirit, and Audacity is widely used for educational purposes for

157
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,920
children in schools.

158
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,440
So it's really a shame if they think this software is not intended for children, because

159
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,440
at least up to now, it's been a huge benefit.

160
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,380
Yeah, it seems like it's fork time, Wes, and it seems like the community's language and

161
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:44,320
tone has shifted to a resignation that, yeah, it's just unfortunate that it's fork time.

162
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,320
When I looked around GitHub this morning just before we recorded, I saw several that have

163
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
already launched.

164
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,880
But, you know, I wonder, Wes, if this isn't going to end up like the OpenOffice, LibreOffice

165
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,800
situation, where the original brand name of OpenOffice is so strong that it continues

166
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
on.

167
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,660
Even with slow, lackluster updates, people still are recommending you go get OpenOffice

168
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,760
and people are still downloading it by the hundreds of thousands.

169
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,880
It's possible, like, you know, Audacity is so established at this point, and people that

170
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,400
want to grab it, like schools and whatnot, they're not really following these news stories.

171
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Exactly.

172
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,600
And there doesn't seem to be any mechanism in place to control access.

173
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,600
And at least for some of the telemetry here, that's all still configured behind build time

174
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
flags.

175
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,900
So much like OpenOffice, you imagine that there's going to be distributions and things

176
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,000
that they ship the regular brand of Audacity, even if they've perhaps got both in the repo.

177
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yeah, and that never is really a great place to be in, where distributions start stripping

178
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,360
out things that the upstream developers are including.

179
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,280
And if they include this stuff, I'm going to just start using Audacity with a Flatpak

180
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,800
and I will just disable network access for that Flatpak.

181
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,480
That is an option.

182
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,840
But I would much rather just have something that the community maintains that can take

183
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,360
the GPL bits of Audacity's improvements that work and not be associated with the Muse group.

184
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,280
Because it's obvious to me at this point that the Muse group doesn't really even appreciate

185
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,060
or understand what they have.

186
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,880
And in my opinion, they have destroyed their relationship with the community.

187
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,640
When you read through the GitHub comments, even on the retraction, all faith is lost.

188
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,440
Because every time it's been this total screw up from the introduction of the project and

189
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,440
how it was introduced and how they handled that, from the communication of the CLA and

190
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,640
the telemetry information, each time the Muse group is shocked and surprised that people

191
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,440
could possibly be upset.

192
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,880
That a community made up predominantly developers and computer users and geeks could be upset

193
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,680
by a privacy policy that is the exact kind of privacy policy that upsets developers and

194
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,680
computer geeks.

195
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,800
Like they're just totally out of touch and that doesn't seem like the right group that's

196
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:55,880
in charge of what used to be, and I hate to use the past tense, what used to be the quintessential

197
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,840
free audio editor.

198
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,840
It's really a shame.

199
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,880
And amidst all of these little scandals, we also haven't necessarily seen the sort of

200
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:08,500
investment and improvements in Audacity that I think many of us were hoping might sort

201
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,080
of make any of these changes worth it in the long run.

202
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,400
Yeah, that's a great point.

203
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,800
It wouldn't have been fantastic to see some of the improvements land first and then some

204
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:23,680
of these extreme changes land second and maybe communicated better.

205
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,440
In the meantime, though, it doesn't really come into effect for you.

206
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,900
It's not until the next release of Audacity that this all comes into effect.

207
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:37,300
The current version, 3.0.2, does not contain data collection or has any kind of networking

208
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,920
features added to it yet.

209
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,400
In 3.0.3, they intend to ship it with data collection and networking features that will

210
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,600
report home your IP, your CPU information, et cetera.

211
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,840
They hold the IP for 24 hours because, for some reason, they need to know when you're

212
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,800
converting a WAV file to an MP3.

213
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,000
More bad news.

214
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,160
Announced last summer, and starting this August, Google will require that new Play Store apps

215
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,200
will have to be published using something known as the Android App Bundle format.

216
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,760
If you're not familiar, and I certainly wasn't, the Android App Bundle is Android's new official

217
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:20,000
publishing format that replaces APKs, at least for developers, when submitting apps to the

218
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,360
Play Store.

219
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,640
Google says it should offer a more efficient way to build and release your app.

220
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,120
It works essentially like this.

221
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,940
Instead of building a bunch of different APKs and uploading those to Google's store after

222
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:37,520
signing them yourself, now you'll just upload the one Android App Bundle format.

223
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:43,560
Google will generate a whole bunch of device-specific APKs and then sign all of those itself.

224
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:49,040
Right, so the Google Play Store is doing the signing, and they're still distributing APKs

225
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,560
to the phones, but developers will not be producing APKs anymore.

226
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,480
I think some people are a little uneasy about this because the APK is an open format, and

227
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,080
it's also easier to sideload, say, an APK than an app bundle, as far as I could tell.

228
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,600
But this requirement is only going to apply to new apps, according to Google, and they're

229
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,920
going to do the backend work to actually generate APKs and then make it available for you as

230
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:18,360
a developer to download that APK from the Play Store if you want a local copy of it.

231
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,760
But I think the question we had was, how does this impact, say, F-Droid?

232
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,600
I think there will be some confusion for sideloaders because one of the features of these app bundles

233
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,300
is you can have sort of dynamic parts, like you might have an optional feature for your

234
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,900
app that only gets loaded on some platforms or downloaded later after the fact.

235
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:39,060
But it sounds like if you don't have all the required components, you might get some failures

236
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,480
during sideloading.

237
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,360
But for actual F-Droid itself, it's almost like Google Play is becoming more like F-Droid

238
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,540
because while F-Droid has only open source apps, they actually build all of the APKs

239
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,840
and sign them on F-Droid.

240
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:57,620
I didn't realize that until we looked into this, but you submit your app as source code,

241
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,760
they do the building, they do the signing with a few exceptions, and there are some

242
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,640
well-known exceptions out there.

243
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,960
But this is the way it's been done for a while.

244
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:11,720
Now the Play Store is kind of changing to this model.

245
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,480
And I still don't like it.

246
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,480
I know there's just something about that bundle that I just, I feel like it's just adding

247
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,000
one more layer to making it a little bit trickier to get outside the Play Store.

248
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,040
In some ways, this reminds me of AMP, where there are some benefits out there, faster

249
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,800
load pages, smaller asset sizes that are beneficial for some pages, the biggest pages, the most

250
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,120
complicated pages.

251
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,000
I think that's probably true of app bundles for some applications.

252
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,960
But there are real downsides that are costs here, and is anyone really weighing those?

253
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:56,160
Doesn't feel like it.

254
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,680
Leno.com slash LAN.

255
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,600
Go there to get $100 in credit and support the show.

256
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,680
No matter what skill level you're at or what technology stack you use, Leno can help your

257
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,200
ideas come to life on the web.

258
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,840
And if you ever have any trouble, Linode has the best customer support in the business.

259
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,760
Awarded by the people, and along with hundreds of guides and tutorials, you're gonna get

260
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,600
up and going in no time.

261
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Linode feels like part of our team.

262
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,160
Behind the scenes, it's what makes JB possible.

263
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,720
If it weren't for these spots, you'd never know that Linode is making all this infrastructure

264
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,240
hum because it just runs.

265
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,920
It's fast, it's reliable, and it's making your experience great.

266
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,560
Linode's been easy to use and has a powerful cloud dashboard.

267
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:40,580
With S3 compatible object storage, cloud firewalls, and simple one-click application deployments

268
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,600
with their super fast networking, they are their own ISP, and so much more, you'll find

269
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,200
there's tons of uses of that $100 credit.

270
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,200
So go over there to Leno.com slash LAN and get that credit and support the show.

271
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,160
Their one-click Minecraft server lets you specify features like NPCs, game mode, all

272
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,920
the critical little things you need to set up all in one nice, easy-to-use screen.

273
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,080
And you know, 66% of companies save money working with a mix of alternative cloud providers

274
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,980
instead of just relying on one big old hyperscaler.

275
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,500
Linode can be part of your multi-cloud strategy.

276
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,520
That's why you gotta check it out for yourself.

277
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:25,200
Linode.com slash LAN.

278
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Linux.ting.com.

279
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,920
Thank you to Ting for sponsoring this episode of the Linux Action News.

280
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,920
If you're sick of overpaying for cell service, go see how much you could save and then take

281
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,880
$25 off of that at linux.ting.com.

282
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,840
Ting is an MVNO, or a mobile virtual network operator.

283
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,840
That means Ting mobile customers get the same access as the customers of, say, the big networks,

284
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,720
but with better customer service and at a lower cost.

285
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,200
With Ting mobile, you get the same coast-to-coast coverage as you would with the big guys, but

286
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,280
you just pay less for it.

287
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,040
And Ting's plans are way simpler and straightforward.

288
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,940
In fact, I love their new set 12 plan, which gives you 12 gigs of data with unlimited talk

289
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,660
and text for just 35 bucks a month.

290
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,480
And a good family plan is hard to find.

291
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,200
But with Ting's Flex plans, they address this particular pain point in a way only Ting can.

292
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,200
You add as many lines to your account as you need, you just pay 10 bucks per line.

293
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,800
Every line gets unlimited texts and calls, and every line shares that same pool of data.

294
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,640
And if you need two, 20, or a lot more gigs, Ting's got a perfect plan for you.

295
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,880
And every plan gets access to Ting's award-winning customer service with nationwide LTE and 5G

296
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,440
coverage, plus the freedom of no contracts ever.

297
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,840
It's simple to switch to Ting.

298
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,920
Pretty much any phone works on Ting, so just head over to linux.ting.com, check your current

299
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,760
phone, create an account, pick the plan that's right for you, and then Ting will send you

300
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,760
a SIM card.

301
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,040
You pop that in, you get activated in minutes.

302
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,640
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier with Ting's brand new plans.

303
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,880
The next generation of Ting mobile is here.

304
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:04,040
Go see how much you could save, and then take 25 bucks off of that at linux.ting.com.

305
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:09,400
On June 27th, Linus Torvalds released Linux 5.13.

306
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,640
And as expected, the development cycle turned out to be a busy one.

307
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:20,660
The AMD GPU driver alone is almost 2.4 million lines of code, but never fear, there were

308
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,480
some things that also got cleaned up and removed, and there's still a lot of patches that are

309
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,000
landing as a result of the University of Minnesota patch review.

310
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:36,120
LWN reports that 5.13 was supported by a minimum of 232 different employers and a record-setting

311
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,120
2,062 developers.

312
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:43,080
Believe it or not, this is the first time more than 2,000 developers have participated

313
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,080
in a single release cycle.

314
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,440
And some notable features for 5.13 include support for Apple's M1 Silicon Macs, at least

315
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,760
initial early support, the beginnings of support for wireless wide area networks, and improved

316
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,240
support for the advanced configuration and power interface spec on laptops.

317
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,320
Well, Microsoft's been busy with 5.13.

318
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,920
Their Azure network adapter was merged, a tool which makes it easier to build hybrid

319
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,480
networks, as well as more support for their line of Surface laptops, and some interesting

320
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,360
early work to support Linux as an ARM64 Hyper-V guest.

321
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:24,360
We've also seen plenty of enhancements to RISC-V support, and a change long in the making,

322
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,720
the merging of the Landlock Linux security module.

323
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,240
This is a big one, Wes, Landlock is a stackable Linux security module, and it aims to make

324
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,880
it possible to create safe, secure sandboxes for unprivileged programs, in addition to

325
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,600
the existing system-wide access controls, hence the stackable part of this.

326
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,720
This kind of sandbox is expected to help mitigate the security impact of bugs or even malicious

327
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,960
behaviors in userspace applications.

328
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,640
Landlock is inspired by Seccomp BPF, but instead of filtering syscalls and their raw arguments,

329
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:05,560
a Landlock rule can restrict the use of kernel objects directly, things like file hierarchies,

330
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,480
making it simple to say, restrict the directories a program is allowed to access.

331
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,280
If this sounds familiar to security models on other operating systems, well, that's

332
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,440
because it is.

333
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,520
Landlock was directly inspired by efforts like XNU Sandbox, FreeBSD's Capsicum, and

334
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,440
OpenBSD's Pledge.

335
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,240
Now you might be thinking, why not use some of the mechanisms that the kernel already

336
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
provides?

337
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,880
The Linux Security Module Subsystem, or LSM, offers mechanisms like SE Linux and SMAC,

338
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,600
but those are really meant for administrators and not necessarily end-users.

339
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,280
Not only can their configuration be complex, but the critical part here is that those policies

340
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,540
require system-level privileges to modify.

341
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,680
Often you have to be root, where Landlock is built for end-users with the goal of working

342
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,800
for unprivileged accounts.

343
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:01,480
Of course, with the release of kernel 5.13, the merge window for 5.14 is now open.

344
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,760
Among the features slated for inclusion already are Raspberry Pi 400 support, updates to handle

345
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:14,480
some recent or upcoming x86 CPUs from Intel and AMD, and support for more GPUs including

346
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,160
Qualcomm's Adreno 660.

347
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,560
Well it's not all perfect in 5.13 land, though just a quick note, there's also a bug that's

348
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,480
biting people right now that you should know about.

349
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,680
Dave Jones reported the following.

350
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,800
This made it into 5.13 final and completely breaks NFSD for me.

351
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,840
Existing mounts on clients hang, as do new mounts from new clients.

352
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,160
Rebooting the server back to RC7, everything recovers.

353
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:44,600
The good news is, a fix is already merged and it's an RC1 of Linux 5.14, and it was

354
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,200
really caught before any distributions shipped this thing at scale anyways.

355
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
What went wrong?

356
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,880
Well, a previous commit optimizing bulk page allocations added a bug where the allocation

357
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:57,400
would appear to fail if already allocated.

358
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,560
Thankfully that meant the fix was just a simple one line change.

359
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,940
Really just a bit of a PSA for everyone before we leave this week.

360
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,920
We started this episode with the release of POP2104 and we are wrapping this week with

361
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,840
the end of life for Ubuntu 2010.

362
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:18,640
It's true, official support for Ubuntu 2010 ends on July 22nd, 2021.

363
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,200
We wanted to let you know so you can make some plans if you need to.

364
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Yes, indeed.

365
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,840
Perhaps a good chance to try something new and we hope you make plans to listen every

366
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
single week.
