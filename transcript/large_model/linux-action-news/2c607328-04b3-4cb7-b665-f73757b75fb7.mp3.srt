00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,260
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 182, recorded on March 28th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,260
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,260
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,260
Well, hey, Wes.

5
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,260
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,660
After weeks of anticipation, GNOME 40 has been released.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,700
A range of improvements came together in 40.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,100
To get the details, we went right to the source.

9
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,720
My name is Neil McGovern, and I'm the executive director of the GNOME Foundation.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,460
And of course, we had to ask Neil what the big changes were in GNOME 40.

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,960
So yeah, I guess the change that everyone's talking about is the move from the sort of

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,480
vertical to horizontal in the dash in the overview.

13
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,720
Yeah, so that certainly caused quite a few concerns when we first talked about it, but

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,520
I think we've ended up with something that works really well and seems to be, that seems

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,560
to have people quite excited for.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,320
The overview change is GNOME 40's biggest feature and maybe most controversial.

17
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,440
And that's why the GNOME team was glad to have user research to back up their decision.

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:10,280
So I asked Neil, how did those research studies impact GNOME 40's changes?

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,720
So one of the things is that the overview hasn't really sort of seen the way of design

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,360
updates since its introduction in 2011.

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,560
And other aspects of the desktop have evolved, so we had notifications, system status, unlock

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,000
login, things like that.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,960
But the overview hasn't really seen much in the way of improvements.

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,000
So not only did the overview need a refresh, but there was a number of limitations in designs

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,360
that kind of became apparent over the years.

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,280
So things like the somewhat unhelpful blank boot state, the sort of lack of coherent touchpad

27
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:53,960
gestures and, in particular, some ambiguous nature of things like the workspace switcher.

28
00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:02,320
So what we did is we went back through some original conversations, which started about

29
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,080
2017.

30
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,760
And as that design took place, a great deal of user research took place.

31
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:14,820
So we included sort of exploratory interviews, surveys, user testing, diary studies.

32
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,360
And so it is that research that sort of fed into the ongoing design work to sort of make

33
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,080
sure that the new design is attractive to both new and existing users.

34
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,020
And while the overview changes are the biggest user interface change, there's a lot of technical

35
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,440
changes under the hood as well.

36
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,680
Some of them relate more to GTK4, but some of them relate to the changes made to input.

37
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,720
I asked Neil if moving input to its own thread will be noticeable by us end users.

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
Yeah, absolutely.

39
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,240
Fortunately, we've managed to pull that out.

40
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:53,280
It's quite technical the way it works, but basically the Linux kernel really, really

41
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,880
doesn't like anything interrupting when you do things with disk access.

42
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,360
So it doesn't really care what your mouse or your keyboard is doing.

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,520
If it's touching your disk a lot, then it'll just drop those vents on the side.

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,400
So hopefully this helps speed up things a little bit and sort of helps us capture a

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,320
bit more of that to make things smoother.

46
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,680
Now with these technical changes and the overview changes, that means there's going to be some

47
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,680
work for extension developers, and there's really just no way around that.

48
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,680
And I've noticed, and something Wes and I touched on in a previous episode, the GNOME

49
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,800
project seems to be reaching out more to shell extension developers, and I asked for some

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,040
details on those efforts.

51
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
Sure.

52
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,560
So this was started by a few members of our community.

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,400
It's a fairly long running initiative, I think.

54
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,440
It's called Extensions Rebooted, and it's a collaborative effort to kind of address

55
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,920
those issues around the GNOME shell extension ecosystem.

56
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,320
So we wanted to make a few different policy changes and technological improvements to

57
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,000
try and build that sustainable community.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,640
So I mean, its ultimate goal is to get the extension community to work with each other

59
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,320
and have closer ties with GNOME shell developers and to provide documentation and tools.

60
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,240
But no conversation around GNOME extensions goes very long until API is brought up.

61
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,480
Somebody wants an API for GNOME extensions in every conversation.

62
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,120
So I asked just about that.

63
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,600
Is GNOME considering a stable API for extension developers to utilize?

64
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:30,440
Well, so you have a strange duality here of there's been a lot of talk about GNOME providing

65
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,080
an API, which is all stable, and that to make sure extensions don't break between versions.

66
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,280
But the downside to that is that extensions just can't be as powerful as they are now.

67
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,940
So by writing extension, you have full access and full control to all of GNOME shell.

68
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:54,880
But what we're really interested in is making sure that there's proper documentation about

69
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,560
how extensions work and doing things like providing tooling so people can find out what

70
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,620
they need to do when a new shell version comes out and their extension needs updates because

71
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,360
the underlying shell has changed.

72
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,960
So that's everything from like a CI pipeline and providing a virtual machine where people

73
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,560
can see the nightly version of GNOME to kind of really test and get more involved with

74
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,680
GNOME upstream rather than just working somewhere else on them by themselves.

75
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,840
And it leads one to wonder, what are the next technical challenges for GNOME?

76
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:34,440
So yeah, the next kind of big thing where we're looking at is the move from a lot of

77
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,640
the core apps into GTK4, which was just released in December.

78
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:45,040
And I mean, GTK4 has been a huge, colossal multi-year development endeavor, starting

79
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,280
I think late 2016, and it just released at the end of the year.

80
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,280
And there's a few things that have really come in from that.

81
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:59,280
So I mean, just on a pure technical point of view, there's been a lot of work like creating

82
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,520
a new GL renderer for GTK.

83
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,680
So the initial motivation for that was to improve rendering performance on Mac OS where

84
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,800
the GL drivers are not as forgiving as they are on Linux, but it also gives us a chance

85
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,180
to apply the things we've learned over our current GL render and sort of reorganize the

86
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,200
code with the night of future improvements and such as reordering, batching of draw commands,

87
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
et cetera.

88
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,500
Now, I hate to ask this, but with all that in mind, I had to know what is in store for

89
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,820
GNOME 41.

90
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:35,080
The big move towards GTK4, I think, is going to be a real good set of things that you can

91
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,080
get from that.

92
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,680
And those can be, let's imagine, better graphics, harder acceleration, things like that.

93
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,040
But also, there's some simple things in there that we can actually do with GTK4 now.

94
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:55,780
So for example, pop-ups that happen when you click on a menu or something like that was

95
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,880
always tricky because you have a little beak that sort of points to the button which you

96
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,160
clicked on.

97
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,800
And so now with the new positioning protocols, then quite frankly, it makes the beak point

98
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,720
where it's meant to and also allows like shadows underneath and around the popover, which you

99
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,820
can, and as they're window shadows, you can actually sort of click through them to go

100
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,520
to the underlying window.

101
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:24,760
Or simple things like we now have with GTK4 actually sort of accelerated smooth scrolling

102
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,640
that has kinetic properties as well.

103
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,200
So it just makes that experience a whole lot smoother and feels a lot more natural.

104
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,080
And to a simple one, which I personally just love and it seems a bit odd, but it's just

105
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,800
wonderful, is that when you have a text editor, instead of just blinking the cursor on and

106
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,320
off, you can put a slight fade in and fade out at the end and it just makes it look so

107
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,360
much nicer.

108
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,480
So I think a whole lot of polish around there just to make things look and feel really good

109
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
to use.

110
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,640
Thanks to Neil McGovern for answering all our GNOME 40 questions.

111
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,880
If you're feeling brave and want to give it a try, check out the Fedora 34 beta which

112
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,840
was just released.

113
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:06,080
And if your distribution is not upgrading to GNOME 40 just yet, don't feel left out.

114
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,200
There's a new stable release of the GNOME 3 series, 3.38.5.

115
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,560
It's a bug fix release with patches for numerous issues and crashes, along with support for

116
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,960
handling monitor changes during screencasts.

117
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,640
Sis admin or not, there comes a time when we must all update.

118
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,360
This was one of those rare moments, though, where we got a heads up something was coming.

119
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,400
The OpenSSL project warned us on Monday, March 22nd, that critical security fixes were forthcoming.

120
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:40,900
Then on March 25th, OpenSSL version 1.1.1h was released, with a check to disallow certificates

121
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,940
in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters.

122
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,280
As we record, patches have landed in just about every Linux distribution, so update

123
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,080
from your local repo today.

124
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:59,120
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account and support the show.

125
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,040
Linode makes cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible.

126
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,920
We use Linode for everything in JB 3.0.

127
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,980
Just over the weekend, we were spinning up new rigs on Linode because once you start,

128
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,980
you just can't stop.

129
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,200
It's like potato chips, and that's why that $100 credit is great, because you can get

130
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,680
a real sense of what you can do with Linode.

131
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,240
There's a lot there, but it's nice, easy to use, and accessible.

132
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,360
And with 11 data centers around the world, there's probably something close to you that's

133
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,200
going to work really fast.

134
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,280
Linode's been around since 2003, one of the first companies in cloud computing, three

135
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,760
years before AWS and other enterprise providers.

136
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,160
So they've refined this well.

137
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,960
They really have this thing dialed in.

138
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,080
Their SSDs are super fast.

139
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,900
Their interconnect between their data centers is nuts, because they're their own ISP.

140
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,640
They're truly dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

141
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,760
If it runs on Linux, it'll run on Linode.

142
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,160
Linode.com slash LAN.

143
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,040
While you're there, check them out, create an account, get that $100 credit, and support

144
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
the show.

145
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,480
I often talk about Linode's fantastic support, and how they'll let you do just about anything

146
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,720
you can that's legal with the system.

147
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,160
I think this is really making the point this week, though.

148
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,560
In the show notes, I'll have a document that's forked from Linode's own documentation on

149
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,600
installing Windows on Linode.

150
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,360
Yeah, there's actually people that want to run Windows on Linode.

151
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,680
You never know what reasons somebody might have, and it is indeed possible.

152
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,000
Myself, I love Linode for all the distributions they support.

153
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,240
Arch, CentOS, Alpines, Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE, all of them.

154
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
They're all on there.

155
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,600
I mean, they really get Linux, and it shows when you start to use Linode.

156
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,680
So go try them out.

157
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,600
See why they're our hosting provider of choice, while we host everything for JB 3.0 on Linode,

158
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,840
and see what they can do for you.

159
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,540
Linode.com slash LAN.

160
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,520
Free Software Advocate Richard Stallman is rejoining the board of the Free Software Foundation.

161
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:54,200
Stallman founded the FSF in 1985 and acted as its president until 2019, when he resigned

162
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,880
after making widely criticized statements about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

163
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,360
Stallman announced the news during LibrePlanet's livestream last week.

164
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,720
I have an announcement to make.

165
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,920
I'm now on the Free Software Foundation board of directors once again.

166
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:18,040
We were working on a video to announce this with, but that turned out to be difficult.

167
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:25,000
We didn't have experience doing that sort of thing, so it didn't get finished, but here's

168
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,760
the announcement.

169
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:32,440
Some of you will be happy at this, and some might be disappointed, but who knows?

170
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,400
In any case, that's how it is.

171
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,900
And I'm not planning to resign a second time.

172
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:47,380
Stallman had resigned from the FSF, as well as his position at MIT, after participating

173
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,920
in a conversation about MIT's leadership and its ties with Jeffrey Epstein.

174
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,820
Stallman defended MIT professor Marvin Minsky, who had allegedly had sex with one of Epstein's

175
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,640
trafficking victims, saying, quote, the most plausible scenario was that Minsky had been

176
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,240
unaware that the woman was being coerced.

177
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,840
For some critics, the problems went beyond that exchange, covering other statements and

178
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:14,040
actions he'd made over his years in the free and open source software community.

179
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:18,240
Even after his resignation, Stallman remained in charge of the GNU project.

180
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,800
This news does not change that status, and Jeffrey Knoth remains the president of the

181
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,200
Free Software Foundation.

182
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,000
The major development since the news became public now is that a range of pushback about

183
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,420
his return has come out, as well as concerns around how the voting process was conducted.

184
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:39,400
An open letter by major free software projects is urging the removal of Richard Stallman

185
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,040
and the entire FSF board.

186
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,200
In part, the open letter states,

187
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,920
Richard M. Stallman, frequently known as RMS, has been a dangerous force in the free software

188
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,800
community for a long time.

189
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,920
He has shown himself to be misogynist, ableist, and transphobic, among other serious accusations.

190
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,320
They then go on to say, these sorts of beliefs have no place in the free software, digital

191
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,180
rights, and tech communities.

192
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,760
With his recent reinstatement to the board of directors of the Free Software Foundation,

193
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,800
we call for the entire board of the FSF to step down, and for RMS to be removed from

194
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,960
all leadership positions.

195
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:18,180
Letter signers include Neil McGovern, GNOME Foundation executive director and former Debian

196
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:24,100
Project leader, Deb Nicholson, general manager of the Open Source Initiative, Matthew Garrett,

197
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:30,300
a former member of the FSF board of directors, all eight members of the Xorg Foundation board

198
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,000
of directors, Elena Hashman of the Debian Technical Committee, Open Source Initiative

199
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,840
and Kubernetes Project, Molly de Blanc of the Debian Project and GNOME Foundation, and

200
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,560
more than 2,000 other signatures.

201
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,520
As you might expect, an open letter in support of RMS has also been created, and it has been

202
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,720
signed by over 3,500 individuals as of this recording.

203
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,240
A section of their letter that gives us insight to their position states the following.

204
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Historically, RMS has been expressing his views in ways that upset many people.

205
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,160
He is usually more focused on the philosophical underpinnings and pursuing the objective truth

206
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,440
in linguistic purism, while under-emphasizing people's feelings on matters he's commenting

207
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
on.

208
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,800
This makes his arguments vulnerable to misunderstanding and misrepresentation, something which we

209
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,680
feel is happening in the open letter calling for his removal.

210
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,080
His words need to be interpreted in this context and taken into account that more often than

211
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,440
not he's not looking to put things diplomatically.

212
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,280
Regardless, Stallman's opinions on the matters he is being persecuted over are not relevant

213
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,320
to his ability to lead a community such as the FSF.

214
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,960
Furthermore, he is entitled to his opinions just as much as anyone else.

215
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,800
Members and supporters do not have to agree with his opinions, but should respect his

216
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,720
right to freedom of thought and speech.

217
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,800
Having read both letters, I hear what each side is saying, and some of his defenders

218
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,900
points might even have some legitimate merit.

219
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,900
But this isn't one of those things that's going to go away with time.

220
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,560
This isn't going to get better in a few months.

221
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,560
In fact, this very reaction we are seeing right now, even a year and a half after RMS

222
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,880
originally resigned, proves that point.

223
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,920
People will never forget the history of things that RMS has said.

224
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,560
They're online and documented forever.

225
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,000
And here is the crux of the issue.

226
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,360
The Free Software Foundation is an establishment of ideas, which they would claim are moral

227
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,680
ideas.

228
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,160
The public's reaction and memory to all of this is totally incompatible with the Free

229
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,800
Software Foundation's mission to campaign against threats to computer user freedom and

230
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,760
their other stated goals.

231
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,120
To truly win that campaign, they must provide moral leadership to all of society, and they

232
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,160
must do so effectively, regardless of anyone's personal opinion about RMS and what he has

233
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
said.

234
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,560
The effectiveness of the FSF will be limited by the situation, limited in many ways from

235
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,040
mindshare to community.

236
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,960
And I suspect nothing short of a full board change will actually make those who are concerned

237
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,760
about all this trust the FSF again.

238
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:13,000
The reality is the human aspects of creating software eventually become the hardest aspects

239
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,200
to manage.

240
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,120
And if the world truly needs saving like RMS says it does, then perhaps he should reflect

241
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:26,120
on the wise words of Batman.

242
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,120
Or put another way, the steady progress of time inevitably brings a shift in the way

243
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,480
and what society values.

244
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,920
The FSF was not immediately available to provide comment on Stallman's return or what role

245
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,080
he will play on the board.

246
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,360
We'll keep an eye on this story, and you'll find extensive links at linuxactionnews.com

247
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,480
slash 182.

248
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,720
Linux dot ting dot com.

249
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,560
New plans, same great service.

250
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,840
And I can tell you friends, a good family plan is hard to find, but Ting's new flex

251
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,440
plan addresses that particular pain point in a very customer friendly way.

252
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,840
You can add as many lines on your account as you need, just ten dollars per line.

253
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:09,120
Every line has unlimited texting calls, and every line shares the same pool of data.

254
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,940
Then you just pay five dollars per gigabyte of data needed.

255
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,320
But if you need two gigs or 20 gigs or more, there's a perfect Ting plan for you.

256
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:21,800
Every Ting plan gets access to Ting's award winning customer service with nationwide LTE

257
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,400
and 5G coverage, plus the freedom of no contracts ever.

258
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,080
And the thing that's great about Ting is you have three fantastic networks to choose

259
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
from.

260
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,480
I like Verizon these days, but there's several you can pick, and it's simple to switch

261
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
to Ting.

262
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,380
Pretty much any phone works on Ting with all those networks.

263
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,160
So just head to linux.ting.com.

264
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,640
Check out your current phone, see if it works, create an account and pick the plan that's

265
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
right for you.

266
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,480
When you go to linux.ting.com, you're going to get $25 off to work with.

267
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,820
That might pay for your entire first month.

268
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,280
That's what a great deal Ting is.

269
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,720
Ting will just send you a SIM card and you pop that in and you are good to go.

270
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,480
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier with Ting's new plans.

271
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,260
Get everything you need at linux.ting.com.

272
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:09,360
I can tell you as a long time customer, it's great and there has never been a better time

273
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,760
to try Ting than right now.

274
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,000
Bring your phone and get $25 off at linux.ting.com.

275
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,600
It caught our attention this week when the new CEO of Qualcomm said the current global

276
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,000
chip shortage might not end until late 2021.

277
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,600
So we wanted to bring you up to date and tell you how this might impact the Linux ecosystem.

278
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,840
How did this all start?

279
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,840
In short, COVID-19.

280
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,440
Obviously, supply chain shutdowns from the pandemic are going to play a role here.

281
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,200
That has a knock-on effect.

282
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,560
But additionally, sales are up across the board.

283
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,800
Anything that has a chip in it, it's selling more of right now.

284
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,960
People are upgrading their gear and CNBC's business news reporter, Kith Leswing, put

285
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,960
it this way.

286
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,520
So what became very clear is that, you know, there was a supply chain disruption, but one

287
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,640
step kind of started working its way through in the summer and China started getting back

288
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,360
to work, but trust companies knew that they needed to increase production by a lot.

289
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,000
And there is no sign sales are slowing.

290
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:26,120
Global semiconductor sales have grown from $412 billion in 2019 to $439 billion in 2020.

291
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,160
Car manufacturers are some of the hardest hit, but this is a problem throughout the

292
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,680
tech sector.

293
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:37,720
How quickly things get back to normal depends on the planning companies did before the lockdowns,

294
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,560
at least according to Daniel Newman, research analyst.

295
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,560
It sort of depended on the stockpiling that these different companies did.

296
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,560
You know, I mentioned Toyota.

297
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,880
Toyota's in better shape, had stockpiled more, where other companies, when they cut their

298
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:54,800
forecasts, cut their, you know, manufacturing for periods of time, and now they're waiting

299
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,280
in the back of the line.

300
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,760
So we wanted to take the temperature of the Linux ecosystem and contacted System76's

301
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,160
CEO Carl Rochelle on how the shortage is impacting their systems born to run Linux.

302
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,520
And Carl wrote in with this, he says, chip supply constraints have caused procurement

303
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,200
issues for motherboards, CPUs, and GPUs.

304
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,540
We've adjusted our purchasing strategy and hold more in stock in an attempt to even out

305
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,460
supply for our customers.

306
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,000
Even with that, it is a challenging environment.

307
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,760
Carl goes on to note that their new AMD laptop, the Pangolin, sold out faster than anticipated

308
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:35,120
and AMD CPU supply is too tight for them to provide even estimates for new stock arrivals.

309
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,920
GPUs are a nightmare, Carl says.

310
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,200
Tariffs and demand are pushing up prices and forcing OEMs to speculate in the GPU market

311
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,200
just as much as everyone else, particularly with Nvidia chips.

312
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,760
Both AMD and Nvidia are beginning to loosen up, but that's starting from an extremely

313
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,360
tight supply situation to begin with.

314
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,000
Carl goes on to say, well, I suppose we're happy that we're getting the tiny amount of

315
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,520
stock at all because it's absolutely better than nothing.

316
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,420
He says that they anticipate at least another six months of challenging supply.

317
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,000
And in general, it means fewer options for the entire Linux ecosystem until the supply

318
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,780
chain can catch up with demand.

319
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:20,920
Not an easy situation to deal with, but I have faith they'll eventually figure it out.

320
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,880
And it just makes me look forward to our tips for getting the best performance out of Linux

321
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
in the future.

322
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
Linux Unplugged.

323
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Absolutely.

324
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,080
You'd be surprised the kind of kick you can get out of an old machine with the right tweaks.

325
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
But we'll be back next week.
