Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.080 --> 00:19.680
This is episode 43, recorded on March 4th, 2018.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.680
I'm Chris.

00:20.680 --> 00:21.680
And I'm Joe.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.680
Hello, Joe.

00:22.680 --> 00:26.920
It's good to be connected with you one last time before I head out to Scale 16x.

00:26.920 --> 00:32.400
And we start with some news that is decidedly retro for me, but it has lots of possibilities.

00:32.400 --> 00:37.960
Yes, Yolo have announced Sailfish 3, the next generation of the independent mobile operating

00:37.960 --> 00:38.960
system.

00:38.960 --> 00:42.000
And they sure use the word independent a lot in this announcement, don't they?

00:42.000 --> 00:46.160
They're very keen to stress that they are an alternative to Android and iOS.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.020
Yeah, independent jumps out a lot.

00:48.020 --> 00:50.600
There's another phrase that I thought was kind of funny.

00:50.600 --> 00:55.040
Regional licensing jumps out a few times, and it's all over their video as well.

00:55.040 --> 00:59.040
Those are two phrases I also heard come out of the lips of Mark Shuttleworth.

00:59.040 --> 01:05.140
He said that that was one of Canonical's primary advantages against Google and Apple and Samsung.

01:05.140 --> 01:09.260
They were independent, but yet still a business you could depend on to create a good product

01:09.260 --> 01:11.960
and establish a business relationship with.

01:11.960 --> 01:15.120
And that was one of their propositions.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.400
Sounds like that's the same proposition Yolo is trying to make.

01:17.400 --> 01:22.000
Yeah, and speaking of regional, there are some regions where smartphones are not really

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
affordable.

01:23.000 --> 01:28.200
But now, Yolo want to go after the feature phone market with Sailfish 3, which is kind

01:28.200 --> 01:29.560
of a pivot for them, isn't it?

01:29.560 --> 01:30.860
Yeah, I mentioned retro.

01:30.860 --> 01:31.920
This is what I was talking about.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.640
I'm actually really looking forward to seeing where this goes.

01:34.640 --> 01:38.720
These feature phones are pretty popular in developing nations, but I think they're also

01:38.720 --> 01:41.640
making a resurgence in Western nations.

01:41.640 --> 01:44.840
And the version of Sailfish that's coming to these feature phones will come pre-installed

01:44.840 --> 01:49.520
with some core Sailfish applications, including Facebook.

01:49.520 --> 01:50.520
And more will be coming.

01:50.520 --> 01:54.920
As well as some open source ones and an app store where users can download a few select

01:54.920 --> 01:58.600
Android apps, depending on the capabilities of the feature phone.

01:58.600 --> 02:03.400
This version will also be compatible with non-touchscreen phones and numerical keypads,

02:03.400 --> 02:09.000
like a small, tiny phone with a week of battery running a free operating system.

02:09.000 --> 02:15.240
Now, Sailfish 3 is going to roll out in stages sometime in Q3 of 2018, first landing on the

02:15.240 --> 02:16.240
Sony Xperia XA2.

02:16.240 --> 02:21.880
Yeah, there are a few new devices, including the Gemini PDA, which was supposed to be dual

02:21.880 --> 02:26.880
booting Linux and Android, but now with Sailfish as an extra option on there, suddenly I'm

02:26.880 --> 02:28.360
wishing I'd back that project.

02:28.360 --> 02:32.080
Yeah, also a forthcoming tablet out of Russia is going to be running Sailfish.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.440
I don't know much about it, but could be interesting.

02:34.440 --> 02:39.360
Yeah, just when we thought they were dead or dying, it looks like they're making a comeback.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.100
But I don't know how much faith I have in them as a company, really, because they've

02:43.100 --> 02:48.840
been really up and down, haven't they, and mostly down, to be fair, with failed deliveries

02:48.840 --> 02:51.520
of the tablet.

02:51.520 --> 02:56.240
They've got this new licensing model, and they are very keen to stress it, as you said,

02:56.240 --> 02:58.480
so maybe there is hope for them.

02:58.480 --> 03:03.880
I don't think that in the West it's going to be a huge competitor to iOS and Android,

03:03.880 --> 03:09.600
but I think that perhaps it will find its niche in developing countries, and maybe in

03:09.600 --> 03:15.040
feature phones in the West, but I'm not convinced that there's as much demand for those as people

03:15.040 --> 03:16.780
like to think.

03:16.780 --> 03:21.520
You had that Nokia 3310 reboot last year, now you've got the banana phone from the Matrix

03:21.520 --> 03:22.760
coming back.

03:22.760 --> 03:26.320
I think that there's a lot of people who think they would be interested in that and may in

03:26.320 --> 03:33.560
fact buy one, but come on, a week with that or even a day with that, you're going to be

03:33.560 --> 03:37.520
wanting your Android phone back or your iPhone pretty quickly, I think.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.560
The pragmatist in me says, you're probably right, Joe.

03:40.560 --> 03:44.520
I have a sense I would get a feature phone and maybe just keep it around for novelty

03:44.520 --> 03:49.100
sake or use it when I'm looking to disconnect for a day or two, but probably wouldn't end

03:49.100 --> 03:51.400
up my daily driver.

03:51.400 --> 03:55.000
Now something that Google's trying to do to make Chromebooks your daily driver is allow

03:55.000 --> 04:00.440
you to run full-fledged Linux applications potentially, at least according to some screenshots

04:00.440 --> 04:03.960
and information we've seen leak out onto the web.

04:03.960 --> 04:08.920
Something called Crostini, which is being billed as virtual machines, but it may just

04:08.920 --> 04:14.680
be containers, but either way, this seems to me to be a direct competitor to the Windows

04:14.680 --> 04:18.240
subsystem for Linux that you have on Windows 10.

04:18.240 --> 04:22.120
It seems like Google don't want to be left behind here and they want developers to be

04:22.120 --> 04:23.520
able to use their Chromebooks.

04:23.520 --> 04:27.960
Yeah, now we have seen some screenshots of how this would be implemented and it's a pretty

04:27.960 --> 04:28.960
straightforward UI.

04:28.960 --> 04:33.040
In the case of the screenshot that's come out, it's actually installing the terminal,

04:33.040 --> 04:37.280
which that would seem to open up a lot of possibilities, and hence the Windows subsystem

04:37.280 --> 04:38.760
for Linux comparison.

04:38.760 --> 04:42.720
You have different companies now taking major positions here.

04:42.720 --> 04:47.780
You have Microsoft with the subsystem, you have Google with potentially this Crostini

04:47.780 --> 04:51.120
or whatever it is they're calling it, and then we're going to talk about Samsung later

04:51.120 --> 04:54.800
on in the show also positioning that for developers.

04:54.800 --> 04:59.360
Everybody is trying to carve out an on-the-go development workstation because if anything

04:59.360 --> 05:02.880
Dell has shown the market, you can really succeed when you target them specifically

05:02.880 --> 05:03.880
with hardware.

05:03.880 --> 05:09.880
Yeah, I was going to say, XPS 13 seems to me the ultimate developer on-the-go workstation,

05:09.880 --> 05:10.880
doesn't it?

05:10.880 --> 05:13.520
Yeah, and they seem to figure that out, what, four years ago, five years ago?

05:13.520 --> 05:16.360
Yeah, and now the other companies seem to be catching up.

05:16.360 --> 05:21.000
Do you think that any of these solutions really are going to compete with a full-blown Linux

05:21.000 --> 05:24.240
laptop running an i7 with 16 gigs of RAM plus?

05:24.240 --> 05:25.240
I don't think so.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.120
I think the momentum is already too strong there.

05:27.120 --> 05:31.280
I think the edge cases where you need that extra resource or you need the real machine

05:31.280 --> 05:36.040
or you need to be running closer to production, those add up and they end up just putting

05:36.040 --> 05:41.920
you on a full-fledged Linux desktop, but if you're traveling, you need to just do something

05:41.920 --> 05:45.600
really quick, you need an SSH connection, you need to build something, check something

05:45.600 --> 05:48.500
in or out, that it could work for.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.360
It could be a supplemental tool.

05:50.360 --> 05:55.160
Yeah, possibly, possibly, and I suppose the education factor as well because Chromebooks

05:55.160 --> 06:01.040
are much, much cheaper and so it makes them even more attractive to schools teaching computer

06:01.040 --> 06:02.240
science, doesn't it?

06:02.240 --> 06:08.160
That was my first thought, was my son has been issued a Chromebook as part of his school

06:08.160 --> 06:09.160
curriculum.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.920
They create him a Google account, he's in there using Google Docs every day, he's getting

06:12.920 --> 06:17.400
indoctrinated just like they used to do back in the day with Microsoft and Apple, and that

06:17.400 --> 06:22.720
would mean potentially he could start playing around in the Bash terminal, I assume it's

06:22.720 --> 06:28.320
Bash, in the Linux terminal of some kind on his Chromebook, and I really can't find anything

06:28.320 --> 06:29.320
wrong with that.

06:29.320 --> 06:33.340
Yeah, it's almost like an escape hatch, isn't it, from the otherwise being completely locked

06:33.340 --> 06:34.640
in to Google.

06:34.640 --> 06:39.820
I like to think that maybe Google wants to give people the power to compute on these

06:39.820 --> 06:42.120
devices that are capable of doing more.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.320
That would sure be a nice non-evil scenario.

06:44.320 --> 06:50.800
Well, yeah, I mean, even my really ancient C720 is well capable of running proper Linux,

06:50.800 --> 06:55.360
you're not going to be compiling kernels really quickly or anything, but you can do pretty

06:55.360 --> 06:59.640
much basic browsing on it, and that's only got two gigs of RAM, and now the modern Chromebooks,

06:59.640 --> 07:04.600
not even the really fancy ones, like the Pixel or whatever, but even a standard Chromebook

07:04.600 --> 07:09.960
that's like two, three hundred dollars, is well capable of running proper Linux applications,

07:09.960 --> 07:14.600
so I think this was long overdue, really, adding this functionality, at least as an

07:14.600 --> 07:16.160
option for people who want it.

07:16.160 --> 07:19.520
Well, as you say, proper Linux may not be required anymore, because you're going to

07:19.520 --> 07:24.000
be able to run applications on Chromebooks, and on the Windows side of things, when the

07:24.000 --> 07:29.920
subsystem no longer does it for you, you'll be able to run an enhanced version of 18.04

07:29.920 --> 07:35.400
inside a hypervisor VM, with what they say is going to be surprisingly good performance.

07:35.400 --> 07:42.840
Yeah, Microsoft is extending their hand to us Linux users yet again, and making it really,

07:42.840 --> 07:50.000
really easy to run Ubuntu VMs on Windows with proper mouse integration and just no hassle

07:50.000 --> 07:55.200
whatsoever, it really feels like bad news for Linux, as far as I can see, because it's

07:55.200 --> 07:59.280
yet another reason for people to not bother installing Ubuntu to bare metal.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.700
Why would you, when you can have such a flawless VM experience?

08:02.700 --> 08:05.340
So they say it's going to be three mouse clicks away.

08:05.340 --> 08:10.780
They're testing it today on Ubuntu 16.04, but they plan to ship 18.04, and I'll tell

08:10.780 --> 08:11.920
you why that is.

08:11.920 --> 08:16.440
So like Joe said, it's got mouse integration, it also has full clipboard functionality,

08:16.440 --> 08:20.080
drive redirect icon support, but there's something even bigger.

08:20.080 --> 08:24.760
This is where the performance really comes in, is they've baked in XRDP.

08:24.760 --> 08:30.600
It relies on the RDP protocol, which anybody that's used RDP on Windows servers knows,

08:30.600 --> 08:33.160
it's probably the best thing out there as far as remote desktop goes.

08:33.160 --> 08:38.280
You can really just work on it 24-7, and they've implemented that on Linux using the open source

08:38.280 --> 08:40.280
XRDP project.

08:40.280 --> 08:44.560
Over on the hypervisor side, they're connecting to Hyper-V sockets, which light up all these

08:44.560 --> 08:45.560
great features.

08:45.560 --> 08:48.120
These sockets enable this functionality.

08:48.120 --> 08:55.480
And on the Linux side, it's called HV underscore SOC, which is baked into Ubuntu 18.04's kernel

08:55.480 --> 08:57.120
out of the box.

08:57.120 --> 09:01.580
4.15 has this upstream, this HV underscore SOC.

09:01.580 --> 09:07.480
That supplies a byte stream based communication mechanism between the host partition and the

09:07.480 --> 09:14.720
guest VM, the Ubuntu 18.04 VM, which is sort of similar communication style to TCP, except

09:14.720 --> 09:19.080
it's going over an optimized transport layer called the VM bus.

09:19.080 --> 09:24.560
And they have contributed those changes, which allow XRDP to utilize these hypervisor sockets

09:24.560 --> 09:25.560
back upstream.

09:25.560 --> 09:30.960
So it'll probably be coming to the XRDP project, but that means they're using this Hyper-V bus

09:30.960 --> 09:36.440
at the kernel level to communicate between the VM and the 18.04 guest to really make

09:36.440 --> 09:37.640
the display fast.

09:37.640 --> 09:41.360
Yeah, the script's available to test this on 16.04 now.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.840
And then in a few months when 18.04 comes out, you're going to be able to use it in

09:44.840 --> 09:46.300
production.

09:46.300 --> 09:51.220
And I just have to ask myself, how much longer can I pretend to be positive about this from

09:51.220 --> 09:55.560
a Linux point of view and a FOSS community point of view?

09:55.560 --> 10:01.880
Because you can say, well, it shows that Linux is serious, Microsoft has to take it seriously.

10:01.880 --> 10:08.440
But a company that size embracing this stuff, it's like they've woken up over the last few

10:08.440 --> 10:11.120
years and realized that they have to do that.

10:11.120 --> 10:15.920
And they're just potentially going to trample over any market share that we could have otherwise

10:15.920 --> 10:16.920
had.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.160
I look at it a little bit differently.

10:18.160 --> 10:23.200
I look at it in the same light that I look at LibreOffice and Firefox and a bunch of

10:23.200 --> 10:27.160
really other great open source applications being available for Windows.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.420
They made it easier for people to switch to Linux in the long run.

10:30.420 --> 10:34.320
In my opinion, the best way to switch somebody to Linux is for the first six months to a

10:34.320 --> 10:38.760
year, switch them to a full open source suite of applications on their Windows or Mac desktop

10:38.760 --> 10:41.140
and let them get used to that workflow.

10:41.140 --> 10:44.280
I think that could be happening here because at the end of the day, you're going to have

10:44.280 --> 10:49.000
more users running Ubuntu and Linux and using GPL software.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.880
They might be doing it on the Windows desktop, but it's going to be more users using open

10:52.880 --> 10:53.880
source software.

10:53.880 --> 10:58.820
Well, that in of itself is good, but is it going to prevent them from moving over to

10:58.820 --> 11:03.080
using Linux full time because it's just so easy to use the good bits of Linux, the best

11:03.080 --> 11:05.720
bits that they need from within Windows?

11:05.720 --> 11:07.100
Or will it whet their appetite?

11:07.100 --> 11:09.280
I think that's the part we just have to wait and see.

11:09.280 --> 11:14.720
Well, let's hope that you're right and that I'm wrong.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.560
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

11:16.560 --> 11:20.960
Go to Linux Academy and go to the slash unplugged page to sign up for a free seven day trial

11:20.960 --> 11:23.280
and support the Linux action news.

11:23.280 --> 11:28.240
Linux Academy is an advanced training platform to learn more about Linux and all of the fundamental

11:28.240 --> 11:33.160
features around it, with self-paced in-depth video courses, hands-on labs, and real human

11:33.160 --> 11:36.720
beings that are full time instructors that are there creating content and available to

11:36.720 --> 11:37.720
help you.

11:37.720 --> 11:41.880
And a great feature of the Linux Academy platform is the course scheduler.

11:41.880 --> 11:43.720
You simply log in and create a course schedule.

11:43.720 --> 11:48.380
You can specify how many hours you have available for each day of the week, and then they will

11:48.380 --> 11:51.220
create a training schedule to fit your availability.

11:51.220 --> 11:56.460
And if you want, they'll also send you emails to remind you about the studies and the tests

11:56.460 --> 12:01.040
that you are going to be taking to accomplish that learning track or course or whatever

12:01.040 --> 12:02.280
it is that you have set up for yourself.

12:02.280 --> 12:06.960
They have a wide range of types of courses, like ones for getting ready for certifications

12:06.960 --> 12:12.880
or ones to deep dive on a single topic, say, firewalling on Linux, or entire sets, like

12:12.880 --> 12:17.220
you want to learn this industry, Android development, as an example.

12:17.220 --> 12:19.280
It's this entire umbrella topic.

12:19.280 --> 12:23.000
You can work with all of that within their system and find something that works for your

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
schedule.

12:24.000 --> 12:30.380
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

12:30.380 --> 12:33.260
Another week, another purism story, but don't worry.

12:33.260 --> 12:34.700
It's not about their phone this time.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.440
It's about their laptops.

12:36.440 --> 12:40.020
And so they've got this Librem line of laptops, and what makes them stand out from the various

12:40.020 --> 12:46.980
other Linux laptop sellers is their focus on attempting at least 100% free software

12:46.980 --> 12:51.400
and the privacy that comes along with that and the security, of course.

12:51.400 --> 12:55.300
And so now they've announced a new feature for the laptops that run core boot, which

12:55.300 --> 13:00.660
makes them tamper-evident, which means that you know with 100% certainty that none of

13:00.660 --> 13:06.320
the code has changed since you last booted it, and that it can be trusted and is 100%

13:06.320 --> 13:07.320
secure.

13:07.320 --> 13:11.400
Yeah, and that certainty goes all the way from the BIOS level to the kernel to the initrid

13:11.400 --> 13:13.080
to the boot configuration.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.040
You can verify that they haven't changed.

13:15.040 --> 13:19.600
This is a post by Purism's chief security officer over on their blog, and he writes,

13:19.600 --> 13:24.100
we're excited to announce that we have successfully integrated HEADS into our TPM-enabled core

13:24.100 --> 13:25.880
boot running Librem laptops.

13:25.880 --> 13:30.400
This integration effort began in April of 2017 with the partnership of Purism and Trammell

13:30.400 --> 13:35.920
Hudson's HEADS project, which required hardware design changes, core boot modifications and

13:35.920 --> 13:40.720
operating system updates to reach the point where they could have this unified stack.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.600
And now they have a tamper-evident boot process.

13:43.600 --> 13:48.060
If you're running PureOS and their hardware, you do have to buy their hardware to make

13:48.060 --> 13:52.140
this work, or you can find one of the projects that HEADS supports, which there are some

13:52.140 --> 13:54.560
ThinkPads out there, to accomplish this.

13:54.560 --> 13:59.920
And for certain types of workloads, like government workloads and enterprise-level security workloads,

13:59.920 --> 14:01.280
this is a really big deal.

14:01.280 --> 14:04.960
And HEADS has a lot of advantages over all the other boot verification technologies for

14:04.960 --> 14:05.960
Purism specifically.

14:05.960 --> 14:10.480
It's sort of in alignment with their goals, and it seems to be really solid, open-source

14:10.480 --> 14:11.480
free software.

14:11.480 --> 14:15.240
Secondly, the other thing they're emphasizing in this post is that they're able to use the

14:15.240 --> 14:20.320
TPM chip, which has been a bit of a controversy in the Linux community, to their advantage

14:20.320 --> 14:23.320
in this particular configuration to give the user control of the keys.

14:23.320 --> 14:30.000
I spoke to Todd, the CEO of Purism, on Late Night Linux episode 31, and he really stressed

14:30.000 --> 14:35.320
how this is a really attractive proposition to enterprise, and that is really where they're

14:35.320 --> 14:36.320
going with this.

14:36.320 --> 14:40.800
You kind of think of Purism and their lead-room line of laptops as being for enthusiasts and

14:40.800 --> 14:46.080
people who really care about freedom and wanting to run core boot and all the rest of it, but

14:46.080 --> 14:50.320
the reality is that where they're making their money is selling to enterprise.

14:50.320 --> 14:54.680
And all that enterprise money is kind of going back in and hopefully going to give us this

14:54.680 --> 14:59.960
lead-room 5 phone, and hopefully going to spread this idea that we can have completely

14:59.960 --> 15:03.480
free software running machines, be it laptops or phones.

15:03.480 --> 15:08.480
So I've been skeptical in the past of what Purism are doing, and you certainly pay a

15:08.480 --> 15:14.160
premium for these products, but we're starting to see some real results now from them.

15:14.160 --> 15:16.640
So I think you have to say fair play to them, really.

15:16.640 --> 15:22.320
I still have my skeptical pants on for the lead-room 5 effort, but the laptop line is,

15:22.320 --> 15:28.480
I think, one of the most differentiated custom Linux-first products on the market.

15:28.480 --> 15:33.520
First of all, I've had their early build, and now I've had their latest build line of

15:33.520 --> 15:37.960
laptop, and there's clear, solid lines of improvement where on each iteration they made

15:37.960 --> 15:38.960
it better.

15:38.960 --> 15:40.960
That's a great trend line in and itself.

15:40.960 --> 15:44.360
Now they've been making these constant efforts towards secure boot, locking that down and

15:44.360 --> 15:48.840
giving users control, and now we have the whole stack that's verifiable.

15:48.840 --> 15:52.000
That's a big win, again, that they're at the front line of.

15:52.000 --> 15:57.080
Yeah, and apart from anything else, Todd and the team that he surrounded himself with are

15:57.080 --> 16:00.060
excellent at PR, and we need that in this space, don't we?

16:00.060 --> 16:06.120
We need people to go out and, not evangelize, but certainly spread the word about how important

16:06.120 --> 16:10.520
software freedom is to security and privacy, and that's exactly what they're doing.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.760
Yeah, and to that end, it doesn't hurt that the laptops don't look too bad either.

16:13.760 --> 16:17.160
Yeah, I wouldn't mind having one for sure, but in the meantime, when I'm using other

16:17.160 --> 16:22.120
laptops, it looks like the mainline kernel might be getting some UEFI secure boot improvements

16:22.120 --> 16:23.120
of its own.

16:23.120 --> 16:27.700
Yeah, this is an effort that has been brewing for a couple of years now, and it appears

16:27.700 --> 16:32.660
to be pushed by Red Hat, and there's calls now for it to be integrated into the Linux

16:32.660 --> 16:36.640
Next tree, which would suggest it's going to be coming to Linux stable soon.

16:36.640 --> 16:41.140
From a high level, once this code is upstream, administrators will be able to enable further

16:41.140 --> 16:46.000
restrictions that would be placed on a Linux kernel when running in a UEFI secure boot

16:46.000 --> 16:50.440
enabled environment, like blocking access to certain kernel parameters and modules,

16:50.440 --> 16:54.980
blocking access to areas of slash dev, which obviously that's good because you could manipulate

16:54.980 --> 16:56.760
aspects of the system there.

16:56.760 --> 17:00.920
Does this mean that I have to start actually using UEFI boot and not legacy mode like I

17:00.920 --> 17:03.080
do for all the machines that I buy?

17:03.080 --> 17:04.360
Yeah, Joe, I guess so.

17:04.360 --> 17:06.080
No more legacy boot for us.

17:06.080 --> 17:10.000
Well, you'll take my legacy boot from my cold dead hands, I'm afraid.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
It's so much easier, I find.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.860
You're just not going to have any problems.

17:12.860 --> 17:17.720
But I think if you are in the enterprise space, again, this is where this is really targeted,

17:17.720 --> 17:18.720
isn't it?

17:18.720 --> 17:20.800
Absolutely, and I totally grok why they would want that.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.760
And I could even understand why people that are just on their laptops working out in the

17:23.760 --> 17:28.320
public would want something like this, and it is even good for us to have on consumer

17:28.320 --> 17:29.320
end devices.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.560
So I can't complain that much when you compare it to a phone.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.520
They're not nearly as locked down as these phones are.

17:34.520 --> 17:38.880
Yeah, and as long as legacy boot remains available, then you can boot whatever you want.

17:38.880 --> 17:44.440
But if you're the kind of company that's using Red Hat Enterprise Linux, then I think you're

17:44.440 --> 17:46.800
going to be very interested in this sort of thing.

17:46.800 --> 17:51.680
Speaking of phones and running Linux, Samsung would really like you to run Linux on the

17:51.680 --> 17:53.780
Galaxy or don't say the Galaxy.

17:53.780 --> 17:54.780
Maybe you say Dex.

17:54.780 --> 17:57.120
They seem to be waffling a bit on the terminology.

17:57.120 --> 18:01.240
Yeah, well, Dex is the hardware interface, isn't it, that you plug the phone into, and

18:01.240 --> 18:03.920
then you plug that into your screen and mouse and keyboard and everything.

18:03.920 --> 18:08.040
Yeah, in fact, they just announced a new update to the Dex doc at Mobile World Congress.

18:08.040 --> 18:11.240
Yeah, they seem to be taking this stuff really seriously, and it seems like they've got the

18:11.240 --> 18:12.920
hype train full steam ahead.

18:12.920 --> 18:13.920
I agree.

18:13.920 --> 18:17.120
I've been able to glean a few insights out of the hype.

18:17.120 --> 18:21.520
Number one is this is clearly and hard positioned towards developers.

18:21.520 --> 18:26.600
Number two is they appear to be experimenting with different UIs.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.680
I've seen what looks like Enlightenment on there.

18:29.680 --> 18:33.880
I've seen a Gnome-looking desktop on there that I don't think was Gnome, but it seemed

18:33.880 --> 18:35.240
to mimic Gnome.

18:35.240 --> 18:39.100
There's a lot of different UI elements in this one video that we have linked in the

18:39.100 --> 18:41.560
show notes that I found to be kind of interesting.

18:41.560 --> 18:45.720
The other thing that's neat, you put it in the Dex doc now, the new Dex doc, the phone

18:45.720 --> 18:51.800
turns into a giant touchpad, which is kind of a neat idea, and it appears you can still

18:51.800 --> 18:56.360
use the speakers on the phone and the microphone on the phone in the Linux session.

18:56.360 --> 19:03.160
The Linux session is using the Android kernel, and in some demos, it looks like when you

19:03.160 --> 19:08.000
mouse up to the top of the screen, another menu drops down, like you might see when you're

19:08.000 --> 19:11.000
in VirtualBox, and you go to the top of your VirtualBox window, and then the host menu

19:11.000 --> 19:12.720
drops down.

19:12.720 --> 19:16.720
That was some of the things I was able to glean out of this current hype batch.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.560
Using the phone screen as a touchpad, eh?

19:19.560 --> 19:21.680
If only someone had thought of that a few years ago.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.440
Hang on, they did with Ubuntu phone.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.080
That didn't do them any good, did it?

19:26.080 --> 19:29.080
They also push Eclipse hard.

19:29.080 --> 19:33.200
You see screenshots of GIMP, Firefox, Thunderbird, Terminal.

19:33.200 --> 19:37.720
There's a clear, clear product push towards developers, and the message that they kind

19:37.720 --> 19:41.440
of have buried in all of this is one that I've thought about a lot.

19:41.440 --> 19:46.780
In my opinion, these phones haven't arrived until you can write software for the phone

19:46.780 --> 19:47.840
on the phone.

19:47.840 --> 19:51.960
As long as you still have to have a PC to write Android apps and iPhone apps, they're

19:51.960 --> 19:55.800
baby operating systems, and you still need an adult operating system to actually get

19:55.800 --> 19:56.880
the work done.

19:56.880 --> 20:03.240
But Samsung is attempting to give developers a current day development environment on an

20:03.240 --> 20:08.720
Android phone, where you could write Android apps in this environment.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.680
That's at least a good idea.

20:10.680 --> 20:15.620
I just don't trust, after watching this video, that Samsung's the company to pull this off.

20:15.620 --> 20:16.800
It's some custom environment.

20:16.800 --> 20:22.800
They appear to have bundled like Office 365 web apps on there, and it's just sort of what

20:22.800 --> 20:26.500
you would expect from a large corporation taking a stab into a market that they've never

20:26.500 --> 20:28.240
tried to be in before.

20:28.240 --> 20:31.600
You kind of see them making the same mistakes that a lot of people have made before, trying

20:31.600 --> 20:38.240
to write their own custom UI and trying to write as much new software as possible, when

20:38.240 --> 20:42.320
you think they should maybe be doing something more like what MaruOS is doing, where they

20:42.320 --> 20:47.320
take the Android open source project code, they take the Debian code, they take some

20:47.320 --> 20:53.040
container code and just mash it all together, and it remains all open source.

20:53.040 --> 20:54.040
That's the point.

20:54.040 --> 20:58.540
That's the good thing about open source, it's not just some idealist view.

20:58.540 --> 21:04.200
There are pragmatic reasons to use it, and if you just bolt together loads of existing

21:04.200 --> 21:08.160
open source software, it makes your job far easier.

21:08.160 --> 21:13.800
But then there's always that lack of commercial advantage argument, but if they're selling

21:13.800 --> 21:18.600
the hardware that makes this possible, then surely that's enough for them.

21:18.600 --> 21:22.880
But maybe I'm speculating too much, but just looking at what they've done here, I'm just

21:22.880 --> 21:26.040
very worried there's going to be a lot of proprietary code involved.

21:26.040 --> 21:30.080
They do seem to have the budget to invest over the long haul to make this work, assuming

21:30.080 --> 21:34.280
this isn't just some sort of sub-branch of the Dex product line, and if the Dex product

21:34.280 --> 21:36.480
line goes away, this whole effort goes away.

21:36.480 --> 21:37.480
Very possible.

21:37.480 --> 21:43.360
My thoughts are, if this was like you say, running mainline Debian, or like Debian testing,

21:43.360 --> 21:49.880
or Ubuntu, or Fedora, it would be immediately much more compelling, and it would be much

21:49.880 --> 21:51.680
more useful.

21:51.680 --> 21:55.680
It may be Debian under the hood for all we know, they're not really releasing the details.

21:55.680 --> 21:59.400
So I'd really like to call on Samsung or their Dex team, if they really want to interface

21:59.400 --> 22:03.440
with the Linux community, give us some details so we can start discussing this, we can start

22:03.440 --> 22:05.960
maybe even participating a bit.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.600
Reach out and let us know.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.360
Go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact.

22:10.360 --> 22:11.500
What's running under the hood?

22:11.500 --> 22:12.500
What's running on top?

22:12.500 --> 22:13.560
Is that enlightenment?

22:13.560 --> 22:16.880
Give us some details so we as a community can start discussing this.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.440
Linuxactionnews.com slash contact.

22:18.440 --> 22:23.080
