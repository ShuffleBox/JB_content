00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News Episode 112, recorded on June 29th, 2019.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,400
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,400
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,400
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,400
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,480
So many stories to jump into this week.

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,400
Let's start with a brand new fresh Raspberry Pi 4 that was announced just really kind of

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,840
a few hours after our episode went live last week.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,840
Dang it.

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,920
Yeah, no, this shouldn't have happened.

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,240
We reported a few months ago that there was going to be no Raspberry Pi 4 this year at

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,240
all.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,240
And then suddenly, boom, it shows up.

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,640
Not only did it show up, but it showed up with a skew that I am very happy with at the

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,640
higher end.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,140
Of course, the starting price is $35, but at the higher end, it's $55, US greenbacks,

17
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,360
and you can get it with four gigabytes of LPDDR4 RAM now.

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,360
Yes, that is exactly what I wanted.

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,800
Well that and gigabit Ethernet, I am very excited about dedicated Ethernet now as well.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,600
Those two things alone, I feel like game changers for the Pi, but I believe you actually have

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,600
gotten your hands on one.

22
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,680
Yeah, I got hold of the four gigabyte version, which apparently is quite rare, but I found

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,360
a site, someone linked me to it that was selling it.

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,600
I was not confident it was going to actually turn up, but it did a couple of days later.

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,760
I did have to buy a power supply with it, which actually I'm grateful for now because

26
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,680
it really does need the three amp power supply to run it.

27
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,360
This is a power hungry beast now.

28
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,080
Instead of being based on the 40 nanometer silicon, this time it's 28 nanometer, so it's

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,680
not the very latest technology, but it is significantly improved.

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,440
As a result of that, not only is the RAM faster and DDR4 now instead of two, it is just a

31
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,400
much faster machine.

32
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,000
There's no doubt.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,720
Just general browsing and just everything you do with it is faster.

34
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,840
So I'm curious about two things really, Joe.

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,560
Let's start with the first one.

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,120
New set of adapters required, right, because you've got micro HDMI, USB-C, as you kind

37
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,160
of alluded to, so it's a new set of cables.

38
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,160
How did all that go fiddly?

39
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,320
Did you have to go pick stuff up?

40
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,040
Well, I was forced to buy the power supply with it, so that was taken care of, and I've

41
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,480
got other USB-C cables and chargers and stuff, so I wasn't too worried about that.

42
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,540
It's got two micro HDMI outs now, so you can run two monitors, and I just got the Amazon

43
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:26,040
Basics micro HDMI to HDMI cables for like Â£5.60 or something for the pair.

44
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,920
So I just consider that part of the cost of it, really.

45
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,920
They're pretty short, though.

46
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,840
They're only three foot, but I have got a coupler if I need to make it longer, but so

47
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,840
far it's not been an issue.

48
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,880
I'm happy to see USB-C, to be honest.

49
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,400
It's worth a new power adapter as far as I'm concerned.

50
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,080
The second thing I'm wondering, this is a lot faster of a chip.

51
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,460
In fact, they're claiming it's 3X the performance they're claiming.

52
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,440
It's desktop performance grade that has to equal in more heat.

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,900
When you're consuming more power, you've got a faster processor.

54
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,380
Did you get a sense of heat output, and especially when it was under load, did you get a sense

55
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,720
of how hot it was getting?

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,400
Dangerously hot, I'm afraid.

57
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,220
That's the downside of this.

58
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,560
Everything else is great, but the heat is a real issue.

59
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,800
I would not feel comfortable giving this to my little nephew to play with unsupervised.

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,400
Maybe if it was in a case, I would, but...

61
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,480
You think he'd burn himself?

62
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,040
I think there's a real risk of it.

63
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,840
He's pretty sharp and switched on, but I'd be at least keeping one eye on him to make

64
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,760
sure he didn't touch it.

65
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,200
You cannot hold it for more than a couple of seconds before it starts to burn your fingers.

66
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,820
It's funny that the 3B Plus I noticed was hotter than the 3B, and this is one step up

67
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,800
in terms of temperature.

68
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,620
The whole thing gets hot, and specifically the CPU.

69
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:42,620
It needs cooling.

70
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,720
It's funny, I was listening to the Friday stream from last week, and you guys were talking

71
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,080
about your first PCs on there, and how originally they didn't even have heat sinks, and then

72
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,240
they started to have heat sinks, and then, wow, this one's got a heat sink and a fan,

73
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,880
and that was kind of a big deal.

74
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,120
I think we're getting there now with these pies.

75
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,620
I think we're going to get to the point where you're going to have to use some sort of active

76
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,620
cooling on it.

77
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,620
Perhaps, yeah.

78
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,960
And maybe even if it's not officially recommended, you might find that enthusiasts just start

79
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,640
doing it, you're already starting to see them do it with the previous models.

80
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,480
One difference here now from way back in the day, like we were talking about in the Friday

81
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:25,360
stream, is there is active thermal management and active downclocking.

82
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:33,080
This, as they say, is really designed for bursty performance, which is really their

83
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,340
way of saying after a little bit of high performance time on the CPU, we have to start clocking

84
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,340
down a bit.

85
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:46,320
Let's not forget, not only does this have a faster quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex A72 CPU

86
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,180
in it, but along with all of that is their faster graphics, which is now using a real

87
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,760
full OpenGL stack, in part, thanks to some really fresh software they're shipping on

88
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,760
these new pies.

89
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,280
Yeah, there's a new version of Raspbian that goes along with this, and it's based on the

90
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:09,200
upcoming release of Debian, which is Debian 10 Buster, which is pretty much ready to go

91
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
that.

92
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,680
I think we're going to be reporting on the release of that in the next couple of weeks

93
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,720
probably.

94
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,400
And it generally feels pretty stable and pretty good.

95
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,240
There's a few little rough edges here and there, but in some fronics benchmarks, it

96
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,200
is that little bit faster, I think about 3% faster on a 3B plus at least.

97
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,120
It looks like Michael didn't get a hold of one, but it feels all right, this new version

98
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,760
of Raspbian, but I think that there's a bit of a way to go.

99
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,100
If you look at the earlier versions of Raspbian when they came out, it's come such a long

100
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,100
way.

101
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,720
And with this new hardware and the new system on a chip, there's a lot of work has had to

102
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
go into it.

103
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,480
And I think a bit of the polish still needs to happen.

104
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,680
So I'm hoping that with updates over the next few months, it's going to significantly improve.

105
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
I would imagine.

106
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,520
The official launch date of Debian Buster is July 7th.

107
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,360
So they are a couple of weeks ahead.

108
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:10,040
That said, keep in mind, it's been frozen Buster for a couple of months, I believe now.

109
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:17,000
And they've been testing Buster on the new Raspberry Pi internally since January of 2019.

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,820
So they've had a really good go at it.

111
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,480
They're pretty confident shipping it to end users, but I suspect you're right, Joe.

112
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,520
In a couple of weeks after Buster shipped, there's probably going to be a round of updates

113
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,120
for Raspbian that sort of brings it up with fixes or other little tweaks that I'm sure

114
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,600
will be discovered as more and more users start to use this.

115
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,560
Because not only do you have the upcoming release of Buster, which will put it in the

116
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,400
hands of a lot more people, but you're also just going to have a lot more users now using

117
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:50,280
the Raspberry Pi 4 with this version of Raspbian, they'll discover things, submit them upstream,

118
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,800
and there'll be a natural round of fixes that'll come from this.

119
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,180
It's kind of nice to see them pushing it forward.

120
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,280
And to be clear, the reason why they really went all in on Buster is for that OpenGL video

121
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,520
driver that's now being used by default.

122
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,560
And the development of that driver has been taking place upstream in the most recent version

123
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,960
of Debian.

124
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,520
And they looked at backboarding it to stretch, but they thought, you know, our effort is

125
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:16,520
better spent getting Buster up to production because it's so close already.

126
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,000
And that's what they decided to do.

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,220
They weren't sure if Buster would land before the new hardware or not to when they made

128
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,220
that decision.

129
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,520
It was sort of up in the air.

130
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,720
I'm glad to see it.

131
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
And the early reports are good.

132
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
I ordered one.

133
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,120
I ordered the whole desktop kit of the four gigabyte model because they're really talking

134
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,200
about using this on the desktop when I thought, let's give it a go.

135
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Let's see what it's like.

136
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,040
I'm going to go in with reasonable expectations, but it's nice to see this update because if

137
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:48,280
they get close to desktop performance, maybe kiosk performance, or perhaps nice Kodi media

138
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,040
center performance, I'd be a pretty happy customer.

139
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:54,920
I know there's other devices on the market that have reached this level of performance,

140
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,040
but it's nice to see a Raspberry Pi that's really competitive now.

141
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
Do you know what I mean?

142
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,880
Oh, yeah, definitely.

143
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,120
One thing I was a bit disappointed about was that it doesn't boot from USB.

144
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,000
I was confused for a little while trying to make it work.

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Is it my cable?

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Is it this monitor?

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What's going on?

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,960
But then I looked in the comments for the original post on the Raspberry Pi blog.

149
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,080
And yeah, Eben is commenting there that he says, at present, we only support booting

150
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,960
from SD card.

151
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,520
We will support booting from USB and network in due course via an upgrade to the onboard

152
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,640
SPI flash.

153
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,860
So yeah, a bit of a disappointment there, but hopefully that will be coming soon because

154
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,460
it's USB 3.

155
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:44,840
And if you've got a fast USB flash drive or USB 3 SSD, you could potentially have a really

156
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,120
fast boot experience.

157
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,320
So you can still do it now by moving partitions around and stuff, but it'd be nice to be able

158
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,280
to just stick USB stick in and just have a really simple, fast boot.

159
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,200
I believe him when he says it'll come because when it does arrive, you can see a lot of

160
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:08,120
people taking a USB 3 SSD of any size they want and making that the primary boot disk

161
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,360
for Raspberry Pi and essentially having as much storage as a desktop PC.

162
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
That's the exciting thing.

163
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,080
In the meantime though, you could have a pretty high performance SD card, a boot from that

164
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,840
and then use the attached storage.

165
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,880
And the nice thing is with the Raspberry Pi 4, the USB 3 bus is its own dedicated USB

166
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
bus now.

167
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,480
You're not competing for resources with the network anymore.

168
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,240
So using real storage is an option.

169
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,000
So it'd be nice to see it, but there's ways to make it work in the meantime.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah.

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,120
And I've installed Samba on it with just a spinning drive that is USB 3 that's reasonably

172
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
fast.

173
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,560
Bear in mind that I was transferring from that to my other NAS box, which is not built

174
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,680
for performance at all.

175
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,640
It was built for budget and I was getting three to four to maybe 500 megabits a second

176
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,440
of a ethernet.

177
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,560
So I wasn't pushing it to the gigabit, but I'm sure that you probably could push it a

178
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,800
bit closer if the other end was faster.

179
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
Yeah.

180
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,800
I bet we'll see some projects based around this to turn them into NAS's and all kinds

181
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
of stuff.

182
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
I mean, that's what I'm going to do with mine.

183
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,520
I'm going to play around with that.

184
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,240
Maybe I can make a solid state NAS in the RV or something that's potentially fanless.

185
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,440
We'll see about that.

186
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,320
In the meantime, I'll spend my time waiting for my Raspberry Pi 4 by checking out the

187
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:26,240
new reinvented Firefox preview, at least for Android.

188
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
Yeah.

189
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,240
They call this a preview and it kind of doesn't really have a proper name yet.

190
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,080
And really it's a replacement for Firefox Focus, which was their really stripped down

191
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,200
browser, which is still available, but it's kind of been parked and shelved and there's

192
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,200
no active development on it anymore.

193
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,640
And it's kind of splitting the difference between Firefox Focus and regular Firefox.

194
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,780
It's faster and leaner, but it has far more features than Firefox Focus.

195
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,200
And I feel like it could potentially compete.

196
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,680
It's a little bit rough around the edges, a bit buggy at this point, but it is only

197
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,680
a preview.

198
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,720
It's really for enthusiasts and people wanting to test it for bugs and developers and stuff.

199
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,520
So my expectations were pretty low going into it, but I was kind of pleasantly surprised

200
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,520
by it.

201
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,840
Although I was annoyed that the tabs are at the bottom rather than at the top where they

202
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,840
belong.

203
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,240
I would be willing to bet that's going to change.

204
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,560
A lot of people will have that feedback.

205
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm glad you got a chance to try it because I did actually bring my Android device with

206
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,040
me on the trip to try out stuff, but did not get a chance.

207
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm down in Texas right now.

208
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,560
But I did read through this and I noticed a couple of things that jumped out at me.

209
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,200
And so I did some digging and you're right, Joe.

210
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,240
There is a real emphasis on this not being quite production ready yet.

211
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,520
In fact, if you read through their announcement, they refer to it as A, a preview, B, a pilot

212
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,080
and C, available for early adopters.

213
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,840
So they're really trying to make it clear this isn't for everyone.

214
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,520
But I'll tell you one of the features that jumped out at me, and then I want to talk

215
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
about the performance.

216
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:04,480
But just feature wise, I was really kind of lukewarm to this bundles idea that they have.

217
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,960
They call them collections in this browser, but different browsers have done this concept

218
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,480
before.

219
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,280
And I kind of looked at the way they've done these collections of different websites and

220
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,280
I get it now.

221
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,960
In their example, they show a morning routine collection or perhaps your favorite place

222
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,400
to go plan for trips or shopping for clothes.

223
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,800
And they bundle all those sites together in one like easy to execute group, also easy

224
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,520
to share with other users.

225
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:37,520
And that I kind of dig, like news bundles I could see us using, but that's kind of neat.

226
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,240
So I'll be playing around with it pretty soon.

227
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,040
I might give it a couple of weeks to bake, but let's talk about the performance here

228
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,680
just for a moment.

229
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,640
This is powered by something we've covered on the show before and we're kind of unsure

230
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
where it was going to go.

231
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,560
And now we really have a clear answer.

232
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:56,160
This is running GeckoView, Firefox's new mobile browser engine.

233
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,800
That's the same high performance engine that focus is already using.

234
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,920
And on the Mozilla blog, they say implementing GeckoView paves the way for a complete makeover

235
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,320
of the mobile Firefox experience.

236
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,800
They say all major browsers today are based on blink on Android and reflective of Google's

237
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
decisions about mobile.

238
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:22,160
This is GeckoView engine ensures us and our users independence, that's some bold talk

239
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,160
about GeckoView.

240
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,820
Like this is GeckoView is turning out to be like a key part of their Android strategy

241
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,800
of their reinvention on Android.

242
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
Well, it's like quantum on the desktop, isn't it?

243
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:38,040
It's the basically the only alternative to Chrome and Chromium based browsers now.

244
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,120
And they've realized that that's what differentiates them and then just go in with it.

245
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,400
Yeah, they even kind of talk about how this is their take on quantum for Android.

246
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,760
Like we're going to do what we did for the desktop now on mobile.

247
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,600
They're going to make it faster at a code level, but they also say they're going to

248
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,840
make it faster by designing it to be a little more efficient at a usability standpoint.

249
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,440
And then for the rest of 2019, they're directing their efforts into optimizing the Firefox

250
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,020
experience on Android.

251
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,680
This is of course the mobile teams focus.

252
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,800
And they say in order to have a strong foundation for the next generation of mobile Firefox

253
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,740
browsers, we're going to put all of our efforts into GeckoView.

254
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,440
And that's also at the expense of, like you mentioned earlier, focus going on hold for

255
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,380
a bit or I guess potentially indefinitely, and then maybe being eventually replaced by

256
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,640
this new effort.

257
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,760
We don't quite know yet.

258
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,880
They're not necessarily spelling it out yet.

259
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,480
No, but it certainly looks like focus is going to go away, I think.

260
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,680
Yeah, that would be my inclination from it.

261
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,240
And I think what you're going to end up with is like you said, something that splits the

262
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,200
difference and makes for a pretty good browser.

263
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,280
And along with overall Firefox improvements, one of the things that's landing in Firefox

264
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,720
69 is a random password generator, which is nice because a lot of the other major browsers

265
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,800
offer that now.

266
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,360
So when you get a prompt to create a password for our website, it will suggest something

267
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,080
that's randomly generated and then in theory, I would imagine, offer to save it for you.

268
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,280
Yeah, I think this is long overdue really.

269
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,080
So good to see them doing it.

270
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,080
Yeah.

271
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:07,960
Well, something Microsoft feels is overdue is getting in on that insider circle of Linux

272
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,640
distros that know about those security problems before the rest of us.

273
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:18,640
Yeah, Microsoft employee Sasha Levin has applied to join the Linux distros mailing list, which

274
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:26,160
as you say is where the various distros communicate and coordinate on security disclosures before

275
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,020
the rest of us find out.

276
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,880
And Microsoft are kind of claiming that they deserve to be part of this now because they

277
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,680
have got WSL2 and Azure Sphere, which are proper distros.

278
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,680
So yeah, let us in please.

279
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,960
You would think something called the Linux distros list was something else.

280
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,680
But nope, this is where they discuss these security issues.

281
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,040
And from that standpoint, I can kind of see Microsoft point, I think this is probably

282
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
legit.

283
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,040
You see, there's eight different criteria in which you must meet to get access to this.

284
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,400
Like they're different ones like actively maintain a Unix like operating system distro

285
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,720
with substantial use of open source components.

286
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,480
Like Joe said, they argue the WSL2 does that, that Azure Sphere does that.

287
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,200
They also argue that products like Azure HD Insight, their Kubernetes services and other

288
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:20,040
things on Azure make them a public provider of access to Linux based distributions.

289
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,120
So they also meet another criteria.

290
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
There's other things in here.

291
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,480
Like I said, eight different criteria.

292
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,200
Once they get accepted in theory, they would then get access to these discussions that

293
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,360
are crucial for getting an early heads up on coordinating and handling the deployment

294
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,440
of fixes before they're made public.

295
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,960
Once they're made public, then they go on a mailing list called OSS security, which

296
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,600
you would think would be the mailing list they talk about security issues that are private,

297
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,980
but is in fact the one where they talk about public security issues.

298
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,260
So there's two different mailing lists.

299
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,120
And right now they only have access to the public one.

300
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,320
So they've submitted Sasha on behalf of Microsoft, all those different criteria, he's got an

301
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,040
answer for all of them.

302
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:03,200
Just word noting, he is endorsed by Greg KH, who I think people probably know who Greg

303
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
is.

304
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,900
He's longtime contributor to Linux kernel.

305
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,840
He maintains the LTS branch.

306
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,760
He's Linus's number two.

307
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,340
And the reason why he signed off on Sasha is quite simply, if you just glance at the

308
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:19,280
change log for the more recent Linux kernels, Sasha's all over it.

309
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,200
He's been contributing to Linux kernel pretty steadily recently.

310
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,680
And so he's obviously got the attention of Greg and he is giving Sasha his blessing.

311
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,480
So I think it's probably pretty likely they're going to get in and it makes sense.

312
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,040
They've got cloud infrastructure that's running user loads, powered by open source and Linux.

313
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,520
They should probably stay safe and secure.

314
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Yeah.

315
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,280
And as the register points out, it really does complete their transformation almost

316
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,840
from back in 2001, calling Linux a cancer to here we are 18 years later, and they're

317
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,320
taking part in some of the low level stuff like this.

318
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,280
So I don't know, maybe Microsoft have changed.

319
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,040
Let's see what the YouTube comments say about that.

320
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,560
They love it when you say that.

321
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,560
Yeah.

322
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,560
But speaking of the kernel, when Google Plus went away, suddenly Linus had nowhere to

323
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,560
post and a bunch of the other kernel people.

324
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,680
So they decided to start people.kernel.org.

325
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,400
Following the different kernel developers on Google Plus was quite literally for me

326
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,200
the best thing about Google Plus and the thing I missed about Google Plus when it went away.

327
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,500
So it is really great to see people.kernel.org pop up.

328
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,720
Now there's already a place where you can follow a lot of the kernel developers.

329
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,640
That's planet.kernel.org.

330
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,920
It's an aggregator of a bunch of different blogs.

331
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:39,440
The difference here with people.kernel.org is it's focused on Linux related development

332
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,860
topics, whereas the other is sort of just their blogs, whatever they're talking about.

333
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,080
This is just the kernel development stuff.

334
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,440
And it's kind of one of our secret sauces here that's made a little easier for everyone

335
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:54,240
now is we go out and individually follow these developers and sort of aggregate their blogs

336
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,720
to watch for news.

337
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,440
And now they're doing it for everyone.

338
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,320
So it's people.kernel.org if you want to follow just Linux related topics of different kernel

339
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
developers.

340
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,500
And as you'd expect, it is an ActivityPub enabled federated platform powered by write

341
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,360
freely and some nice hosting by the folks at write.as.

342
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,360
So that's pretty cool.

343
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,840
And you'll be able to see the individual blogs that are on topic.

344
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,840
Yeah.

345
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,000
And unlike planet.kernel.org, they've actually configured the SSL cert properly.

346
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Really?

347
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I hadn't noticed that.

348
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,240
I only follow the feed, so I've never really gone to the website.

349
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,880
Yeah, I haven't for a while, but I've just checked it now.

350
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,920
And yeah, it's misconfigured, unfortunately.

351
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,920
It's pretty cool.

352
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,980
Like I went I've been going there for the last couple of days because I saw this announcement

353
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,160
earlier in the week and was following it since then.

354
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,520
And it's really technical.

355
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,840
Like if you get into like the really geeky low level stuff, this is it.

356
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,640
This is really great.

357
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,960
And you can get an idea a little flavor of the different kernel developers like you can't

358
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,880
do this with other operating systems.

359
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
So it's so cool.

360
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,880
Yeah.

361
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,120
And all running free software as well, which is cool.

362
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,100
So it's kind of the silver lining to Google Plus going away.

363
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,640
Following up to one of the notable topics from last week, we did get a statement as

364
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:10,560
expected from Canonical on the support for 32-bit i36 packages for Ubuntu 1910 and Ubuntu

365
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,120
2004 LTS.

366
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,600
Yeah, and they did the U-turn that we were kind of expecting, but hoping they wouldn't.

367
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,360
And so they are going to support a limited number of 32-bit packages to make stuff like

368
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,160
Steam and Wine work, which I suppose it was just inevitable, wasn't it really?

369
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Yeah.

370
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,780
You got to give Canonical one thing.

371
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,400
They make a strong stance and then they typically will listen to the feedback and it may take

372
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,420
them a while, but they eventually reverse course or compromise.

373
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,200
You can look at Upstart and SystemD, Unity to Gnome.

374
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,740
I mean, just the list goes on and on.

375
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,880
And this is another example.

376
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,120
They say we'll put in place a community process to determine which 32-bit packages are needed

377
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:54,940
to support legacy software and can add to that list post-release if we miss something

378
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
that is needed.

379
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,700
Let's stop here for a second because in the end, I think what we ended up with is a pretty

380
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,160
workable compromise.

381
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,880
Instead of having to manage and maintain hundreds of 32-bit libraries, perhaps they will limit

382
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:14,120
that problem domain down to 30 or 40, which not only makes it more sustainable, but keeps

383
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,760
the end users happy and their partners happy.

384
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,060
Like Valve, it's kind of a great compromise because it's way easier than maintaining hundreds

385
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:24,940
of libraries while also keeping end users and partners happy.

386
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,940
Like everybody wins.

387
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:31,960
Yeah, but they did have plans and ideas for how to solve this problem in another way.

388
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,100
And it feels like just pressure from the community has forced them to just do it the way the

389
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:44,400
community wants rather than pushing forward using containerization and snaps and other

390
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,480
technologies, newer technologies.

391
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,360
They are just going to keep supporting at least some of these old I386 packages, which

392
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,760
it just feels like a bit of a backwards step to me to do that.

393
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,640
It feels like they need to move on, but I suppose people's games are very important

394
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
to them.

395
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,680
There's quite a lot of feedback about our stance on this, and obviously, Canonical got

396
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,760
even more than ours, way more, and I suppose they were going to have to do this.

397
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:23,280
But this means that it could be 2030 by the time they stop supporting 32-bit I386 packages

398
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,080
for people who are paying.

399
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,360
That's an awfully long time.

400
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,360
It is.

401
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,560
And as part of this process in our research, we went back to the original announcement

402
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,400
of the 64-bit transition to just sort of try to take the temperature of what it was like

403
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,920
going from 32-bit to 64-bit.

404
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:44,880
And on linux.com, which we have linked in last week's Linux Unplugged, there is an interview

405
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,560
with some kernel developers in there, and they're clearly talking about this as a temporary

406
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,040
transitional technology.

407
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:56,100
Oh, the 32-bit supports there, but it's really just while we move into 64-bit, and they talk

408
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,280
about it like it's a temporary thing.

409
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,400
And so it's kind of funny to think if that was in 2001, and Canonical may end up supporting

410
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,040
that until 2030s, that temporary transition will have been a 30-year transition around

411
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,240
there, some 29, 28-year transition.

412
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,480
It's like when you do construction work on a house, and you just have a temporary thing

413
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,440
there, and then you just end up stuck with it forever, because it's just more hassle

414
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,280
than it's worth to sort it out.

415
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,560
Just that pipe, we'll just temporarily run it along the surface or whatever, and we'll

416
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,640
sort it out later, and then 30 years later, it's just there all rusty and stuff.

417
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,800
And that's pretty much what we've got here.

418
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,880
I want to talk about Valve's response here in a moment, because they also posted a statement.

419
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,040
But just to wrap this up, I do kind of think this is a pretty nice compromise.

420
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,680
So I think it's not, in the end, that bad of a solution.

421
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,440
I do still believe that we already have existing technology that could have solved this problem.

422
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,720
It is possible today to install a 64-bit-only Linux distro, and then add a Steam Flatpak

423
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,560
that includes 32-bit support.

424
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,560
And you can play the game.

425
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,360
I mean, that's technology that exists today.

426
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,360
Yeah, but someone has to build those 32-bit components though, right?

427
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,360
Oh, sure.

428
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
But that's being done today already.

429
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Like, it's happening.

430
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,200
So we have the technology, I guess is what I'm saying, is it's a possibility.

431
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,160
Steam could also have just included more in their runtime, which they talk about in a

432
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,720
little bit in their post.

433
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,960
I think, ultimately, what made me think this is not necessarily a bad idea to try to work

434
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:28,720
these old 32-bit subsystems and libraries out is the messaging from Canonical.

435
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,400
It's been extremely subtle, but it's there every time they talk about this.

436
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,560
Even in their latest statement, they write, there is a real risk to anybody who is running

437
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,960
a body of software that gets little testing.

438
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,380
The facts are that most 32-bit x86 packages are hardly used at all.

439
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,760
This means fewer eyeballs and more bugs.

440
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,960
They in different ways have tried to say, without having to scare people, we feel we

441
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,720
are shipping vulnerable software that isn't getting properly checked out and tested.

442
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,200
And as a platform vendor, we think this is bad, but they don't want to come out and say

443
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,480
we're shipping vulnerable software because that looks really bad and we get them a lot

444
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,200
of crap, but they have to kind of also communicate to their end users at the same time.

445
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,640
We're really worried about the security of this.

446
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,440
We think you should know that.

447
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,400
That's been completely overlooked in this entire thing.

448
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,080
Yeah, it's not necessarily about it being vulnerable.

449
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,800
It's about it being potentially vulnerable.

450
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,560
It's about simply not knowing because there's not enough testing.

451
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,760
Well, we do know for a fact that they are vulnerable from Spectre and Meltdown type

452
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,680
attacks because no one's ever backboarded the mitigations to that to 32-bit.

453
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,880
Yeah, but that is quite an extreme example, isn't it?

454
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:50,240
Sure, but it is an example of a very well-known, extremely publicized vulnerability that hasn't

455
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,440
made it back to 32-bit.

456
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,120
And so you got to wonder if maybe other things that are a little less known, maybe didn't

457
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,340
get as much publicity, also aren't getting fixed.

458
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,600
I would bet that's true.

459
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,000
Yeah, I remember once there was a bug in Ubuntu that stopped mumble working and that was after

460
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,600
a kernel upgrade.

461
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,000
But the 32-bit kernel upgrade had no effect on it and it still worked perfectly well.

462
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:20,960
And so there are clearly differences between 32-bit and 64-bit x86 and who knows what they

463
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,440
are because if hardly anyone is using 32-bit, then there could be all sorts of bugs.

464
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,080
Maybe they're just bugs like I was talking about there with mumble where it just doesn't

465
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,600
work and just crashes or whatever, or maybe they are security issues.

466
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,600
There's just no way of knowing.

467
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,720
Something that's a bit interesting, again, the last episode of Linux Unplugged where

468
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,920
we talked about this, we did a breakdown of what happens on a Linux box when you launch

469
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,280
a 32-bit application on a 64-bit system.

470
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,340
You think it's, oh, it loads one or two libraries.

471
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:53,840
It's actually extremely complicated, including libraries and components that get loaded that

472
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,520
you may never use, kernel subsystems that get activated the entire stack all the way

473
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
down.

474
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,560
There are ramifications.

475
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:05,000
And I think it's interesting, I never knew it myself until we looked it up and wasted

476
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,200
a full breakdown in the last Linux Unplugged.

477
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,960
Yeah, I was going to say we looked it up.

478
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,840
You mean Wes looked it up.

479
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,840
Yeah.

480
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,840
Yeah.

481
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,120
Or I think I looked it up and said, Wes, this is really complicated.

482
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,360
Could you break this down for us?

483
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,360
He's good at that.

484
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,240
Well, Valve also made a statement.

485
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,960
Now, the same individual that tweeted that, oh, we have to drop support for Ubuntu, this

486
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,760
is outrageous, posted an update as an official statement on the Steam Community website.

487
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,400
And he goes into some background here and mentions the fact that Steam already bundles

488
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,500
a lot of the dependencies needed by 32-bit games, but it currently relies on some key

489
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:46,760
components being available on the host system, a 32-bit GLIB C, an ELF loader, MESA, and

490
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,740
the NVIDIA graphics driver libraries, to just name a few.

491
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,640
He says, we've been investigating ways to avoid these system dependencies for a while

492
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,640
now by looking into light containerization and other approaches.

493
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,200
So this is something Valve apparently has already been looking at.

494
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,800
But the issue is that they wouldn't have it ready by the 1910 release time.

495
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,360
And that's where the upset came from, because it'd either require a fundamental rushing

496
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,360
or a fundamental change in the Steam runtime, either one they weren't happy with in a short

497
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,660
time period.

498
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:24,000
He touches on as well as the response mentioning not recommending Ubuntu to Steam users.

499
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Steam currently, he says, really kind of pushes users to use Ubuntu.

500
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,420
And there may be some changes to that, sounds like, in the future.

501
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:38,720
He writes, there's technical and non-technical reasons behind their concerns, but the bottom

502
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,040
line is that we would have to drop what we're doing and scramble to support 1910, and that

503
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,040
was the main issue.

504
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,320
Well, something that jumped out at me is towards the end of the post where he says, the Linux

505
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,480
landscape has changed dramatically since we released the initial version of Steam for

506
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
Linux.

507
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,440
And as such, we are rethinking how we want to approach distribution support going forward.

508
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,560
And then he says that there are several distributions on the market today that offer a great gaming

509
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:06,320
experience, such as Arch, Manjaro, Pop OS, Fedora, and many others.

510
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:13,760
So that feels like a fairly thinly veiled threat to Canonical, that if you don't play

511
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,400
the game with us, then we're going to start recommending a different distro.

512
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,720
Yeah, or we're going to start recommending all of the distros.

513
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,600
Perhaps some sort of containerized version of Steam would do just that.

514
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,240
The end result would be good, I think, for all Linux users.

515
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,600
I thought it was funny that he mentioned Arch and Manjaro, which are both sort of the same

516
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
code base, essentially.

517
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:38,080
And then Pop OS, which is based on Ubuntu.

518
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,320
The only thing that was really its own unique standout distro in that list was Fedora, which

519
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,640
only just recently got easier to install the NVIDIA driver and flat pack up Steam.

520
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,080
I mean, it works great now, I'll grant you.

521
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,280
That's only a recent development.

522
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:55,360
But in the case of some past attempts at distributing Steam on some of these platforms, they've

523
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,200
come up with their entire own packaging scheme, which I imagine Valve wouldn't be really a

524
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,160
huge fan of either.

525
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:07,960
So it is, it's a weird kind of thinly veiled attempt to throw shade at Canonical.

526
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:15,040
I went through the history of this individual's Twitter feed, Pierre's, and he doesn't seem

527
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,180
to be overall super satisfied with Ubuntu as a platform.

528
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,960
You can see him complaining about the way PPAs are distributed.

529
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,920
You can see him complaining that there was a regression that happened upstream, but Canonical

530
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,040
didn't catch before it landed in Ubuntu.

531
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,440
There seems to be other factors at play.

532
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:40,300
In fact, even in this post, he writes, there are technical and quote, non-technical reasons

533
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,020
behind our concerns.

534
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,020
That's a shame.

535
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:47,560
You know, my personal experience is Canonical is a pretty easy company to work with.

536
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
And they're pretty accommodating.

537
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,840
In fact, they'll work pretty damn hard to accommodate a partner like Valve.

538
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:58,000
But at the end of the day, if Valve can come up with a way to distribute Steam that makes

539
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,040
it essentially a common Steam runtime across all distributions and works really well, that's

540
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:09,400
a win for all Linux users, Ubuntu users, Manjaro users, even Puppy Linux users.

541
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,960
Yeah, and Flatpak seems to be the obvious solution or snap, but given the hostility

542
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,240
towards Canonical, it seems unlikely that it'd be a snap.

543
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,360
But yeah, if they could get a really great Flatpak that worked across all the distros,

544
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,720
then everyone would be happy.

545
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,800
It would be a more appropriate way to distribute Steam because you can't really expect all

546
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:34,440
the different distributions across all the different hardware to really have a specific

547
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,000
set of host libraries like they do now.

548
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,600
It's really kind of created a hot mess.

549
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:44,460
It's created all these different Steam solutions and all of these arch wiki posts and forum

550
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,480
posts and everywhere where people are trying to figure out how to get certain 32-bit games

551
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,980
to work.

552
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,480
It's good if you are in a certain track of Linux.

553
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,960
You know, if you're on one of these distributions he mentioned or you're on mainline Ubuntu,

554
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,900
you really don't have any problems or even Fedora now.

555
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,160
But there are distros, especially ones that are maybe a little more technically modern.

556
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,520
Maybe they only ship 64-bit.

557
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,000
Those distributions, it has been a challenge in the past and you can't necessarily rely

558
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,300
on the host operating system to even have the libraries in the path Steam expects them

559
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,520
to be in.

560
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:20,680
So they do need to fix this problem and you really got to come up with a way to use Linux

561
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,600
as the platform to deliver your product.

562
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
That's how you have to treat it.

563
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,320
And I think that's where they're going.

564
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,400
It'd be nice to see them do it without having to throw shade.

565
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
We'll see.

566
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,400
We'll see how future posts go.

567
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,900
Yeah, we'll keep following it and everything else in the Linux world.

568
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,400
And you probably want to follow that too.

569
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,460
So go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for the ways to get all the future episodes.

570
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,560
And let us know what you think about these stories or feedback for the show, linuxactionnews.com

571
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,360
slash contact for ways to get in touch.

572
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,560
And just a couple of items of note, we recently did a study group on understanding burnout.

573
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,640
It was a really good one.

574
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,360
Major Hayden from Red Hat joined L and we had some great contributions from the Mumble

575
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,360
Room.

576
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,060
That'll be up on our YouTube channel, youtube.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

577
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,100
Highly recommend that to everyone out there who's ever struggled with some burnout.

578
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:14,500
Another note, this upcoming Linux Unplugged that'll be out in a few days as you're listening

579
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,480
to this is all about our experience with PCI pass through.

580
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,480
It's so awesome.

581
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,120
Even if you're not currently thinking about it, I encourage you to listen because it's

582
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:26,600
a new way to distro hop and run Windows, Linux, and Mac OS all at once.

583
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,440
So check out Linux Unplugged coming up soon.

584
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,600
Yeah, I'm going to listen to that tomorrow while I edit it.

585
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,300
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux Diamond Source news.

586
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,920
I'm at Chris LAS.

587
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,520
I'm at Joe Rissington.

588
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,160
Thank you for joining us and we will see you next week.

589
00:33:41,160 --> 00:34:09,000
Take care, bye-bye, see you later.
