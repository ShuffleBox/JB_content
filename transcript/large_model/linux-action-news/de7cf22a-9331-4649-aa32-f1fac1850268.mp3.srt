00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News Episode Zero, recorded May 5th, 2017.

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,360
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,360
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,780
Joe, we've got some really interesting stories this week, and the first one that piqued both

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,100
our interests is one that's coming out of GR Security, and I'm not sure if it's on very

6
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,000
many radars out there.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,160
What's going on with our first story?

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,000
Yeah, so GR Security, they take the kernel, and they add some security patches to it,

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,320
and then sell it.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,120
And up to now, you have been able to see these patches and use them even if you're not a

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,720
customer of theirs.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,960
But now they've decided to pull the plug on that.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,960
And so only if you pay them will you get these changes.

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,600
And that rings alarm bells, right?

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,440
Well, hang on, they're making changes to GPL software.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,800
Shouldn't they have to release the changes?

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,080
So to give it some context, too, you could compare it somewhat to GR Security to SE Linux

18
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,080
or AppArmor.

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,060
In some cases, GR Security would say it's even more complete of a solution.

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,920
And so there are folks out there on Debian systems that are all hardened up with this

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,920
GR Security.

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,160
They're essentially hooked on the good sauce, the good security sauce.

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,240
And they base their audits off this stuff.

24
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,020
It's a very important tool for some people that have these installations, and it's been

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,500
free historically.

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,040
What I thought was interesting, too, Joe, is GR Security is put out by a corporation

27
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,760
that runs it, the Open Source Security Inc. company.

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,640
And they did some sort of big company reforming in 2015.

29
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,440
And this is sort of a big bombshell announcement.

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,920
And I got to wonder if when they reformed, if maybe something was in the works, a way

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,640
to try to get to profitability.

32
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,560
And they essentially say, if you don't want to pay, well, then you can use the one that's

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,500
based on Linux kernel 4.9.

34
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,280
It's an LTS kernel, and it'll last for quite a while, and you can just stay on that.

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,880
But if you want something new, you have to purchase a subscription.

36
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,200
Oh, what's the cost of that subscription?

37
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
Just ask us.

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
We're not putting it on the website.

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Yeah.

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
It's funny.

41
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,520
You talk about corporate restructuring in open source projects.

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
That sounds familiar, doesn't it?

43
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,200
Trying to make a profit all of a sudden.

44
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
Yeah.

45
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,460
This is an interesting approach, though, because it's like you touched on.

46
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:21,280
It's taking GPLed software and saying you can't have access to it unless you pay a subscription.

47
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,200
And I don't think RMS would have a problem with that, necessarily.

48
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,800
But there is a contract agreement, I believe.

49
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,140
It's hard to get details, because there's only vague information online.

50
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,740
But it sounds like you have to agree that you will not redistribute GPLed software.

51
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,780
And if you do agree to that, and you still share the code with somebody, like you give

52
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,800
them some of the GR security software magic, they will terminate your contract.

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,880
So you can share it, because legally, they have to let you, since it's GPLed software,

54
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,080
but they'll punish you for it.

55
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,120
And it's really not in the spirit of open source and free software, this, is it?

56
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,760
Well, how is this different than what Red Hat does?

57
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,160
Well, Red Hat, the source is available.

58
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,160
You've got Centos.

59
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,160
You've got Scientific.

60
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,160
You've got Unbreakable.

61
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,120
The source is available, and it's just not the binaries.

62
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
Right.

63
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Yes, that's true.

64
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,560
But in the same sense, though, they're distributing GPLed software that you pay for with the Red

65
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,520
Hat subscription.

66
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,400
And they are telling you not to redistribute that GPLed software, in some sense.

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
I agree.

68
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,000
It's not a good analogy.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,640
And actually, Red Hat does make binaries available as well.

70
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,480
So the analogy doesn't quite hold up, but it's not, I would say, unprecedented that

71
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,120
there isn't some sort of contract that almost seems to override some inherent aspects of

72
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
the GPL.

73
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,960
Yeah, but even though it's legal what they're doing, probably, although there are some people

74
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,320
online who are kind of arguing that it's not.

75
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:45,080
But even if it is legal, which I think it is, it's just not in the spirit, is it?

76
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,560
The whole point of open source software is that you make your changes available to everyone.

77
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,840
They would argue that they're putting a lot of work into this, and they're seeing demand

78
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,960
to move over to ARM platforms.

79
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,600
They're seeing demand for Android protection and mobile in general.

80
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,360
And there's no funding to do that.

81
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,080
And there's demand.

82
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,800
People are deploying Linux on ARM systems.

83
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,040
They want GR security, and they want to deliver it.

84
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,520
I mean, what are they going to do?

85
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
They've got to make a buck.

86
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,160
Yeah, but that's the argument that kind of just falls down.

87
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,200
If you can't make money from it, then should you be in open source in the first place?

88
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
I don't know.

89
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,960
I mean, I can see why they want to charge money for it.

90
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,960
It's fine.

91
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,120
A lot of work goes into it.

92
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,840
But at the same time, they are taking something that has been contributed to by a lot of people

93
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,160
and is free to anyone.

94
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,520
And yeah, they're working on that.

95
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,200
And then they're not releasing their changes.

96
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,520
It's just not in the spirit of open source.

97
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,640
And I keep saying that because there's one thing to be within the rules and within the

98
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,880
law and the contracts and all the rest of it.

99
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,960
But to be in the spirit of open source, it just looks bad to me.

100
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,560
It feels too corporate.

101
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,920
And I suppose that's probably what they want.

102
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,920
They want to be corporate.

103
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,920
They want to make money, right?

104
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:04,080
Well, I mean, Richard Stallman doesn't have a problem with people making money off of

105
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
GPL software.

106
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,920
Here's where I'll give you something.

107
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,160
I don't know if I completely agree with you, but where I do kind of feel like they definitely

108
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,400
win against the whole spirit of the community is they've been around, they've been doing

109
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,000
this for like 16 years in one form or another.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,300
They haven't been a corporation, I don't think, for that long.

111
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:26,600
But they've been a community, I think, for 16 years and doing this for free for 16 years.

112
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,280
And you got to ask yourself, at what point do you have to make some kind of change to

113
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,320
turn this thing around, to make it in from a hobby to a day job to make it sustainable,

114
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
to grow it?

115
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,360
But that, I think, is one conversation.

116
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,760
Then I think there's a second conversation, and this is where I'm going to give you some

117
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:46,560
ground here, is the second conversation, how they went about it.

118
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,800
How they went about this is rough.

119
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,080
It's brutal.

120
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,620
The change is effective the day of the post, April 26, 2017, that that post went online.

121
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,600
The change was immediate.

122
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,000
No more options, no warning, just done.

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,720
We're switching gears, enjoy your 4.9 based release, we're moving on.

124
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,480
And that, to me, that immediate kind of abruptness, no warning.

125
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:17,120
When you're talking enterprise installations, it's almost like they pulled the rug out from

126
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,760
underneath people and the only way to pick yourself back up is to subscribe.

127
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:26,360
In fact, they even talk about it in their frequently asked questions, where they say,

128
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,800
what do I do if I'm dependent on this?

129
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,520
They say, well, then you should probably subscribe.

130
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
You should probably.

131
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,520
Yeah.

132
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
Yeah.

133
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,640
At least what Canonical did with Ubuntu, changing to GNOME, if you want to stay on

134
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:42,280
community, at least you've got 16.04 for another four years, which you can make your plans.

135
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,280
Whereas this, exactly.

136
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,440
It just feels, it leaves a bad taste in my mouth, put it that way.

137
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
Yeah.

138
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,000
And it seems to be that there could have been a different route, there could have been a

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,800
different path to take here.

140
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,480
I didn't really follow GR security super closely before this because for myself, SE Linux or

141
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,120
AppArmor has always sort of done whatever I've needed.

142
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,760
But it is interesting to check it out.

143
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:09,360
You can go to grsecurity.net and if you want to know how it compares to SE Linux and AppArmor

144
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,460
and why I'm making that comparison, even though it's not exactly apt, you can find it at grsecurity.net

145
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,460
slash compare.php.

146
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,740
Everyone's favorite subject, secure boots in the news this week coming from Debian.

147
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,480
The final stretch of Debian 9 stretch is upon us.

148
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,200
And one of the revelations that's come out from that is secure boots been booted.

149
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Yeah, Joe?

150
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,520
Well, it's considered no longer a blocker to release.

151
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,040
So it's not looking good for its inclusion straight away, put it that way.

152
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,880
So it's not that they're explicitly excluding it, it's that they're not going to let it

153
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,540
hold up the release.

154
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,680
So it could come after release then possibly, I would imagine.

155
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,840
Yeah, I would have thought so because yeah, it's kind of important, but they just don't

156
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,320
deem it important enough to stop the release.

157
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,600
And that's the question you have to ask yourself.

158
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,520
If you are capable of installing Debian and want to install Debian rather than one of

159
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,680
the more, well, I was going to say mainstream, but easier distros like Ubuntu, Fedora, that

160
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,880
kind of thing, are you really the kind of person who's going to worry about going into

161
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,840
your BIOS, well, your EFI and turning off secure boot?

162
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,800
I mean, it's not going to be an issue for someone like me.

163
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,000
I suppose it's dependent on who the target is because there are some servers that have

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,720
secure boot as well and enterprises potentially for security reasons would want to use secure

165
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
boot.

166
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,120
I don't really have the hate for secure boot that the entire Linux community apparently

167
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
has.

168
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,160
Having talked to some people that helped develop it, they seem to have very rational approaches

169
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,160
on it.

170
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,920
The Linux Foundation doesn't seem to have a big issue with it.

171
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,960
They don't even seem to have a big issue with Microsoft asking OEMs to include Microsoft

172
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,140
keys by default.

173
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,560
They say as long as it's consumer choice, they don't really seem to have a big issue

174
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
with it.

175
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
How do you feel?

176
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,720
Because to me, this seems like almost like a non-issue.

177
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,000
Secure boot, either it's on or off, almost doesn't seem like it matters to me.

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,800
Well, where it matters is with the kind of person who goes to their local electronics

179
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:00,560
store, buys a Windows laptop, uses it for a couple of years, it gets so slow that they

180
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,120
can't reliably use it anymore.

181
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,560
Then they start hearing about things like Linux Mint or Ubuntu, and they want to try

182
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
that out.

183
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,480
They follow some instructions, and then it won't boot because secure boot doesn't work.

184
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,840
That isn't going to be an issue with the more mainstream distributions.

185
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,440
Whereas with Debian, that's what I said at the beginning of this.

186
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,560
If you're the kind of person who's wanting to install Debian, then you're going to have

187
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,800
the technical skills to get into the EFI and turn off secure boot anyway.

188
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,960
For me, secure boot, I can't stand it.

189
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
It just gets in the way.

190
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,200
It makes it harder to boot Linux.

191
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,480
The first thing I do, I got a new laptop this week from entryware, and the first thing I

192
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,880
did was turn off secure boot, and then I've just never looked back, basically.

193
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,920
It's been working fine since then.

194
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,960
But the kind of person who isn't going to turn that off, that's why you need to have

195
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,400
support for it.

196
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,240
But for me, Debian, I don't think they need it.

197
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,080
It would be nice to have it, but I think it's justified to say it's not a blocker.

198
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,400
I agree, and I think you have a good point.

199
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
I do take your point.

200
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,480
And also, if you're the type of person that would probably be comfortable installing Debian

201
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,300
and turning on or off secure boot, you might also be someone who would be more inclined

202
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:20,320
to try dev1, the GNU slash Linux project that is Debian Jesse now without systemd, and they're

203
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,060
supporting new devices.

204
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,060
Are they going to get you, Joe?

205
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,560
Are they going to pull you in with their Chromebook support?

206
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,200
Well, not the Chromebook stuff, but the Raspberry Pi stuff, maybe, because dev1, to me, I didn't

207
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,280
think it would even get to a 1.0, and we're at release candidate two now, so we're almost

208
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,520
there.

209
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,320
Because to me, it just feels a bit irrelevant, because systemd, it's one.

210
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,280
There's no point trying to fight against it, and from my experience, I haven't really noticed

211
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
the difference.

212
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,580
I don't really get down and dirty with init scripts and stuff anyway, so as long as the

213
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,720
system boots, that's all I care about.

214
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,160
And in most cases, with systemd, it seems to boot faster.

215
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,440
Well, yeah, exactly.

216
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,480
So that's kind of a plus for me.

217
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,360
Yeah, although I started, you know, Joe, I started as a dev1 skeptic.

218
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,960
I made fun of the name a little bit, and I kind of thought it was a bunch of gray beards

219
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,120
that just wanted everybody off their lawn.

220
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,560
And I still don't quite grok all of the use cases for the project, but I'm starting to

221
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,760
see more of it, especially when it comes to lower-end devices with lower, maybe perhaps

222
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,140
some system memory.

223
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,880
But also, I think it could potentially be a really great distribution to base other

224
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:37,120
distributions off of that want to do very niche solutions, distros that are very targeted.

225
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,700
Dev1 could be a really great base distribution for those, too.

226
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,720
So as time goes on, I'm starting to respect the project a little more and more, and I

227
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:47,080
also got to respect the fact that they're nailing these releases.

228
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,400
You know, they're on their second release candidate just two weeks after the first release

229
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,240
candidate came out, and they're already talking about turning their attention to the ASCII

230
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,620
release, which is their current development branch, once Jessie's released.

231
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,240
So they really seem to have their t's crossed and their i's dotted.

232
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,800
Yeah, well, fair play to them, and choice is always good.

233
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,600
I don't think it's necessarily going to be something I'm going to choose on the desktop

234
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,040
or server, but what interests me is the fact that it's going to be available for a ton

235
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,240
of ARM devices, including the Raspberry Pi 1, 2, and 3.

236
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,840
And I have been pretty vocal in the past about not being a huge fan of Raspbian, the kind

237
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:32,320
of default Debian-based distro for the Raspberry Pi.

238
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:39,080
So maybe, dare I say it, a properly implemented Debian might be nice on the Pi.

239
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,160
And so it's something I'm keen to check out.

240
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,880
Only once we get a proper release, I'm going to check it out, and yeah, maybe I can report

241
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,880
back on it.

242
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,360
I have also been very, very interested in Google's SDK of Google Home, the whole Google

243
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,980
Assistant AI that you can now load on a Raspberry Pi.

244
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,040
And I'm not the only one that's kind of interested.

245
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,400
It looks like, is it MagPi that's putting together a kit, like a do-it-yourself kit

246
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,600
to create a really cheap Google Home?

247
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah, so the Raspberry Pi official magazine called the MagPi, which is funded and subsidized

248
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,320
by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, they have given away a few things in the past, including

249
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,960
the Raspberry Pi Zero, which was pretty amazing.

250
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,880
I mean, people were talking about, in my day, we used to get software disks given away with

251
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,360
magazines, and now we get a computer given away.

252
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,200
And now they've kind of upped it a little bit by giving away this kit, which is basically

253
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:39,960
a cardboard box, a speaker, and a button, and then the other necessary hardware to connect

254
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:47,220
to the Google SDK and get Google Assistant talking to you and interacting with you.

255
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:52,840
And the whole point of the Raspberry Pi Foundation is to get kids into computing.

256
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:59,160
And so on the one hand, I feel that this is a great thing, because you've got kids tinkering

257
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:05,240
with this stuff, and potentially Raspberry Pis that have been sitting in a drawer might

258
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,720
end up being brought out and actually used for this thing.

259
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,920
But then at the same time, I think, well, Google are kind of a big evil corporation,

260
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:21,080
and should the Raspberry Pi Foundation really be encouraging kids to get more enveloped

261
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,240
in that Google world, where everything's tempting because it's free and cool and shiny?

262
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,560
Yeah, but in the world, in the reality of Chromebooks, YouTube, and the Chrome browser,

263
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,520
I feel like that's probably the last worry.

264
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,160
In fact, one of the things I kind of thought was neat about it for the security-conscious

265
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,760
folks that are still curious, it doesn't have always-on listening.

266
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
You have to push the button.

267
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,960
So when you're not pushing the button, it can't hear you, which might be some folks'

268
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,920
preferred way to interact with a Google Assistant.

269
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,160
Well, that's what they tell you.

270
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
Yeah, maybe so.

271
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,640
I think the button press has to be used because that's what activates the microphones off

272
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
on the Raspberry Pi.

273
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,200
I don't remember the details.

274
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,480
Yeah, well, this kit comes with a microphone, and so, yeah, that makes sense.

275
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,160
But you can hook up any mic and speaker to any Raspberry Pi, and you can sort the software

276
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,400
out yourself.

277
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:18,160
So you're not limited to just this kit, but if you do get this kit, then it's free with

278
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,760
a magazine which is like four pounds or something, or five pounds, ridiculously cheap for what

279
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,040
you're getting.

280
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,680
And you wonder how much of that money is Google money and how much of it's Raspberry Pi money.

281
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,960
They've both got a few quid, I think.

282
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Good point.

283
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Good point.

284
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,080
Also, you get at least a good project.

285
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,980
This is the thing with the Raspberry Pi for kids is I've always felt like it's great,

286
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,520
but you actually need something to accomplish that is desirable by the average person to

287
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,120
play with this.

288
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,860
Even if you and I might have concerns about the security implications of always listening

289
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,800
devices or assistance, to be able to say to a kid, you can assemble this box with this

290
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,360
little Linux computer in here, and then you can ask it questions and do Google searches,

291
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,600
that's actually an achievable thing that kids would want to get involved in, or actually,

292
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,760
let's be honest, even adults.

293
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,720
And so I do like that aspect of it.

294
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
I'm not totally sold.

295
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,600
I would love to say I would love to be doing a story that was a Mycroft box, and you came

296
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,360
with all the kit you needed, and it was just a really great, super responsive Mycroft box.

297
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
We're not there yet.

298
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
We're just not there.

299
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,000
The Google Assistant is a real product.

300
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,860
The SDK came out recently.

301
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,420
You can set up yourself, or you can get a kit like this.

302
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,320
And I think it's actually going to get people to get their hands on these things.

303
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,160
I think it's going to be a huge hit.

304
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,440
Man, Mycroft.

305
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,760
That was the word that I just kept thinking about, Mycroft.

306
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,680
And the next word was, why?

307
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,120
Why don't we have that yet?

308
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Where are you?

309
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,640
I don't know, everyone had such good hopes for that, and here we are.

310
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,400
They still haven't delivered.

311
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,640
The opportunity's lost now, surely.

312
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,640
You've got Alexa.

313
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,320
I mean, the thing is, even the real hardcore open source people that I know, like you and

314
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,000
Wimpy and Poppy and those kind of people, you've all bought Echoes now.

315
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,720
You've kind of just given up on that whole Mycroft thing.

316
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,600
You know what else?

317
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,080
He'd probably kill me for saying this.

318
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,160
But if you ask him, he'd admit it.

319
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,160
Noah is looking at the Echo 2 now.

320
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,480
He can connect it to his offline home automation system and use it as the voice bridge.

321
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:26,160
And he was obviously a skeptic, but then working in the studio throughout the last week and

322
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
using it to-

323
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
He sold him on it.

324
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
To control the studio.

325
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
It did.

326
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
It sold him on it.

327
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,560
And you see the benefits of it, especially when you're moving stuff around and working

328
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,240
with equipment.

329
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,360
And so there is something to it.

330
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,760
And you could, the Google Assistant in the Raspberry Pi can connect all the same services

331
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,640
and APIs and control your lights and all of that in that little cardboard box.

332
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,240
And somehow, I don't know, I'd probably prefer Google than Amazon somehow.

333
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
I don't know why.

334
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
Really?

335
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,240
Yeah.

336
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
I don't know why that is.

337
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,240
I just don't really like Amazon.

338
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,000
I think the lack of taxpaying and stuff like that.

339
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yeah.

340
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I have those concerns too.

341
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,160
I mean, they're the Walmart of the internet for sure, but I find their motivation understandable.

342
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,000
They want to put a storefront in my house and they want to sell me goods from their

343
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,360
website that I buy goods from.

344
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,440
But Google has a totally different motivation for putting an assistant in a Raspberry Pi

345
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,880
or in a tube.

346
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,480
And that is data collection.

347
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,000
And they're already experimenting with the advertisements.

348
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,680
So if you can ask these assistants, you can ask all these ladies in a tube, what's going

349
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
on?

350
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
What's new?

351
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
What's the report?

352
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,480
And they'll start kicking off your different news feeds and give you a verbal reading of

353
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,200
what's going on in whatever news feeds you follow.

354
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,600
And then now what they're just doing is they're slipping in an ad for a movie, also playing

355
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,840
today at a theater near you, and it's a paid ad that they're just slipping into the feed

356
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
now.

357
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,920
You can already see the trajectory that they're going with the Google assistant.

358
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:56,520
So for me, when I look at the motivations, it seems like Amazon's probably the most trustworthy.

359
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
I don't even want to say it.

360
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
I can't even say it.

361
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:04,280
Well, you can trust them to be a company that's selling things, whereas Google, what do they

362
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
sell in advertising?

363
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,480
It's kind of a little bit shadier, isn't it?

364
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
Yeah.

365
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
Amazon just wants to sell you shoes.

366
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
Yeah.

367
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,640
I want to take a moment and thank DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Action News.

368
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,640
DigitalOcean.com.

369
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,480
Go there, sign up, and use our promo code.

370
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,480
Here's the thing.

371
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Oh, Joe, we've got to come up with a new promo.

372
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
We'll think about that.

373
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,460
But for right now, go retro.

374
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,460
Here's the thing.

375
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,680
You create an account and you apply to DigitalOcean.

376
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,060
DigitalOcean is an easy way to spin up a server on their infrastructure.

377
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,240
They call them droplets.

378
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,240
I call them magic, and they have a great interface to manage it.

379
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
Really nice services.

380
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,460
And Joe, have you seen DigitalOcean's documentation?

381
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,600
It's like ArchWiki good.

382
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Yeah.

383
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,600
I use it all the time for all kinds of stuff, yeah.

384
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,600
Yeah.

385
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
It's a really convenient way.

386
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,480
Once you get a system set up, they have one-click deployments of an entire application stack,

387
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,960
or you can just do a base system and then go read the documentation.

388
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,040
It's really top-notch.

389
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:03,120
They're also rolling out high CPU droplets, so if you just need a ton of CPU power, they're

390
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,120
rolling that out.

391
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
You can get early access right now.

392
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,620
They've recently rolled out monitoring.

393
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,960
They have block storage.

394
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,400
You can get a machine spun up in less than 55 seconds, and if you use our promo code,

395
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
here's the thing.

396
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,280
You can try out the $5 rig, two months for free, and you're voting for the new show,

397
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,920
which we really appreciate that.

398
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,440
Let our sponsors know that you're still listening.

399
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,120
Go over to DigitalOcean.com, use our promo code, here's the thing.

400
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,000
Spin up a droplet on their incredible infrastructure with 40 gigabit e-connections, SSDs for all

401
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,040
of the storage, and maybe some ponies.

402
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,480
DigitalOcean.com, promo code, here's the thing.

403
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,920
Okay, let's talk about Nexus phones and devices, shall we?

404
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,720
This is a story that I've seen floating around this week, and it wasn't really news to me,

405
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,740
but it seems that it is news to quite a lot of people, and that is that you basically

406
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:54,040
get about three years of support with a Nexus device for official ROMs from Google.

407
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,860
Well, three years if you're lucky, really, because if you buy a Nexus device, say, nine

408
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:05,400
months to a year into its release, which is not unusual because sometimes the Nexus devices

409
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,720
or Pixel devices are actually very hard to get your hands on because Google doesn't seem

410
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,920
to make enough of them.

411
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:16,040
And so if you buy them nine months, a year into release, the phone will stop receiving

412
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,080
updates before your carrier agreement is up.

413
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,520
Yeah, which isn't very good, is it?

414
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,680
As somebody who's bought just about every Nexus, just about, this is something I've

415
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:32,600
definitely noticed, and it does sting a little bit because I thought that was the point of

416
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,920
the Nexus program, was to keep getting updates directly from Google, and I was surprised

417
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:43,080
when little things like a contract with Broadcom expired, so they just stopped shipping updates.

418
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,440
That surprised me when that happened.

419
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,840
And I used to tell myself that this was fine because the Nexus devices, like the 5 and

420
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,420
the 5X, are reasonably cheap compared to other smartphones on the market.

421
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,440
And so if I have to replace them somewhat more frequently, in the end, it's probably

422
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,960
about the same cost.

423
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:06,120
However, now with the Pixel phones being $700, $800, that whole math has changed now.

424
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,640
Yeah, and we're talking about three years here, that is the security updates.

425
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:18,440
The major versions of Android are only two years for the 6P, the 5X, the 9, the 6, and

426
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
the 5 even.

427
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,520
Yeah, and let's be honest, I actually care more about that than I even do security.

428
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
I mean, I want my security updates too, but...

429
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,520
Yeah.

430
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,320
I mean, the thing is that the phones are not completely useless without the security updates,

431
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,800
and let's face it, billions of people or billions of devices out there running, you know, the

432
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,760
cheaper ones, Samsung and other OEMs, that basically you buy the device and never get

433
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,360
a single update.

434
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,000
People are happily using them, logging into their bank and all the rest of it.

435
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,180
So it's not like it gets bricked after three years, but yeah, you'd think that coming straight

436
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:57,540
from Google, and I mean, the thing is that if you buy a laptop running Windows, how many

437
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,280
years are you expecting to get in terms of security updates with that?

438
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,640
I don't know, seven maybe?

439
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
I mean, I would think.

440
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Yeah.

441
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,560
I mean, XP got like 10, you know?

442
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:14,000
So in theory, you can buy a laptop or you used to be able to buy a laptop, a computing

443
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,280
device, which let's face it, phones and tablets are as well, and you could get at least five,

444
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,960
six, seven plus years of security updates, right?

445
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,840
Whereas now with these ARM devices, because it's so difficult to update them because they're

446
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,160
all unique and they all need their unique ROM and drivers and all rest of it, that you

447
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:41,400
get these situations where the kind of shining poster child for updates, the Nexus series,

448
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,640
are only getting three years.

449
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,940
I mean, thankfully you've got custom ROMs and that's something that I have been into

450
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,640
for a long time because I don't want all of the Google stuff.

451
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,040
I want some of the Google stuff, but Open GApps Pico for the win is all I would say

452
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
there.

453
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,240
You get the Play Store and that's it, and then you can build that up.

454
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,280
You can install whatever you want, and I'm hoping that my Nexus 9 and my Nexus 7 will

455
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,760
continue to be supported with security updates.

456
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,800
Right now they're basically up to date, but if you're the kind of person who's not into

457
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,000
doing that kind of stuff and flashing ROMs and just wants stock, then you're just out

458
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
of luck basically.

459
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,440
Well, and that's really, that's really not saying the majority of the market is an understatement

460
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
really.

461
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
That is the market.

462
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,960
It is such a niche to do this custom ROMs.

463
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:34,200
That's why I sort of wince when it even is brought up because it's so often an excuse

464
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,440
for what to me seems to be inadequate customer support.

465
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,320
The iPhone 5, I mean, I don't mean to make this comparison, but the iPhone 5 and the

466
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,640
iPad 4 released in 2012, still getting updates, still getting fixes.

467
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,120
Well my friend just upgraded from a 4S to a 7 and she was still getting security updates.

468
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Yeah.

469
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,320
I'm not saying that should be for all Android phones, it just doesn't seem scalable with

470
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,980
the multi-vendor model, but for Pixel devices and Nexus devices, it seems like that would

471
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,980
be reasonable.

472
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,960
So if you're wondering, the Pixel phones that are on the market right now will stop getting

473
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,080
updates in October 2018.

474
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Which is not very far off, is it?

475
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,080
Yeah.

476
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,020
And then I think you get like security for another year after that.

477
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,640
So you know, take it for what it is, I guess.

478
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,360
At least you know going in, I suppose now.

479
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,360
That was the other thing, Joe, really, is this wasn't really official official.

480
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,920
Like it was not really quite clear for many years with the Nexus program.

481
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,480
So at least now we have some numbers, we have some expectations to be said.

482
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,360
Well they kind of said two and three years, but it had always been from the last time

483
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,360
it was available.

484
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,560
Whereas now we've got some actual, as you say, in numbers.

485
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,260
September 2017, September 2018, that kind of stuff.

486
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,160
So at least people know where they are now.

487
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,760
But maybe it'll drive people to custom ROMs, and maybe even in a dream world, not installing

488
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,080
the Google stuff on there, but yeah, F-Droid and stuff, maybe a better dream on that one.

489
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,200
And maybe convergence will take off, and we'll all be running Ubuntu on our phones.

490
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Oh wait.

491
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,120
Oh well, you never know with Maru, they've got proper conversions.

492
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
Maybe so, maybe so.

493
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,920
And at least we'll all be able to play and encode MP3s.

494
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
So that's good.

495
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,760
Yeah, so there's been quite a hoo-ha about this, the final MP3 patents running out.

496
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,000
And even Fedora now is adding full MP3 support.

497
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,840
So you could previously decode, so you can play back your MP3s, but now you can even

498
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:35,080
encode, or you will be able to on Fedora, which is kind of a sign to me that a legal

499
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:38,560
team as big as Red Hat have got, seem to think it's fine.

500
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,040
So therefore it must be, right?

501
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
Yeah.

502
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,360
Well, and to me, the big signal was that the folks that originally held some of the licensing

503
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,040
posted on their website, essentially saying, have at it.

504
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,880
And I thought, OK, that's a pretty clear communication.

505
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,040
It's still not free software fully.

506
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:59,880
I mean, it's free as in cost, and it's free as in speech, but it's not open source code.

507
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,600
But here's my question to you.

508
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Is this enough?

509
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,280
And is this going to be the death of Ogg?

510
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,600
Could be.

511
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:13,400
Could be, because, yeah, I suppose now that you don't have to worry about MP3.

512
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,880
But then again, is this not a sign that MP3 is a defunct format?

513
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,760
I mean, it's basically ubiquitous at this point.

514
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,080
Yeah, that was actually what they implied when they posted it.

515
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,080
Was it Fraha?

516
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,080
How do you say their name, Joe?

517
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,080
Do you know?

518
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,080
The Fraunhofer?

519
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,080
Fraunhofer?

520
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,760
I would say Fraunhofer.

521
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,760
OK.

522
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,520
So they essentially said on their blog, yeah, we're done.

523
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,520
We're over MP3.

524
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,020
There's other things we're moving on to.

525
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,640
There's other better stuff out there.

526
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,200
And we have plenty of patents on those things.

527
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,560
But there's probably petabytes of MP3 sitting on various people's hard drives and NASes

528
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
and stuff.

529
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Oh, for sure.

530
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
For sure.

531
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,400
And the reality is, when I asked you about the Ogg thing, the reason why I asked is we've

532
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,040
recently, for our new shows, been doing a whole new renovation on the back end.

533
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:02,240
And that includes moving to different hosting providers for our files and doing a lot of

534
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,920
market research.

535
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:10,880
And Joe, in my market research, what I found was that MP3 is the de facto supported format

536
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,240
everywhere.

537
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,440
And if a platform like Libsyn or another one has support, it's sort of like hacked on.

538
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,520
And if they do have a secondary format support, it's almost always M4A, AAC Audio.

539
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,320
And Joe, these companies, their entire business is hosting podcasts.

540
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,400
That's what they do.

541
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,320
And they don't have Ogg support.

542
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
And this is not one of these many companies.

543
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,000
They simply don't have Ogg support.

544
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,820
They maybe, maybe have AAC support.

545
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,480
And they definitely have MP3 support.

546
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,580
So in the podcasting world, it's getting harder.

547
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,840
It's getting harder to distribute Ogg files.

548
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,040
It's costing more because you have to build your own hosting solutions.

549
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,960
And if you have a lot of downloads, it gets expensive.

550
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,920
Yeah, well, hopefully this will mean that people will stop complaining, why don't you

551
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
have an Ogg?

552
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
Why don't you have an Ogg?

553
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,040
Because MP3 is relatively free now.

554
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Yeah.

555
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Can we all just move on to Opus?

556
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,440
I want everybody asking, where's the Opus?

557
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Where's the Opus?

558
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,440
What about Speaks?

559
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,440
Yeah, where's Speaks?

560
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
I want Opus, Speaks.

561
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,760
I want it in VP9, too.

562
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,480
Just I want to take an image file and encode it in VP9 with a Theora audio track.

563
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Why not?

564
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
I don't know.

565
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,080
I don't know if we're going there.

566
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
Let's face it, Chris.

567
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,080
We should be putting this out in FLAC.

568
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
Right.

569
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,400
That's the only format that matters.

570
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,400
I agree.

571
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,400
We can only do it for two minutes, though.

572
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
We have to make it a two-minute show.

573
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,400
That way it fits.

574
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Yeah.

575
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,200
Well, that does bring us to the end of our first episode, episode zero of Linux Action

576
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
