00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News Episode 142, recorded on January 26th, 2020.

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,360
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,360
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,680
Good to be connected with you, although not so good to start out with a story that gets

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,240
me all fired up.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,520
Yeah, we have to start with bad news again, and this is that Rocket League will no longer

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,640
be supported on Mac and Linux after March.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,440
That really upsets me because, A, we play Rocket League in my household, B, I have been

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,240
to some awesome Rocket League tournaments at Linux Fest Northwest, all on Linux, and

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,400
it was a very memorable experience for me and the boy.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:48,340
And three or C, whatever I'm on, I'm so frustrated now, it was one of the example launch platforms

13
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:49,340
for SteamOS.

14
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:55,480
And so it's, I mean, it really stings, Joe, it just stings so hard because, A, I've bought

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:02,280
this thing three times over for Linux, and, Z, it has started a whole round of trolling

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,200
by developers who are using this as an opportunity to shame Linux.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,240
Well, that's one way to look at it.

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,960
And yes, there has been some trolling, which I'm choosing to ignore.

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,200
But the reality of this situation is that Psyonix and Epic want to make changes.

20
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,660
They want to upgrade the DirectX version.

21
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:26,760
And it is not economically viable for them to make the equivalent changes on the Linux

22
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,500
version and the Mac version.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:37,820
Because combined, they say that Linux and Mac users form under 0.3% of the user base.

24
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,580
So what's Linux then?

25
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:44,000
Let's say 0.15, let's be charitable on that.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,520
It would be fiscally irresponsible of them to spend resources supporting Linux.

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,200
They just can't do that.

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
Yeah, okay.

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,440
That is the hard number and there's no avoiding.

30
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:01,040
Yeah, when you combine both of Mac and Linux together, it's still only 0.3%.

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,300
And considering it was one of the early games to support the platform, and it's a fairly

32
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,920
well known game, and it's often featured in eSports, you'd think it'd be one of the more

33
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
popular ones.

34
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,440
Well, yeah, the thing is that it is very popular in our community, in the desktop Linux community.

35
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,460
But I think that sometimes we delude ourselves about how popular desktop Linux really is

36
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,600
in the grand scheme of things.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:32,840
And gaming on Linux is a tiny niche of basically a tiny niche of computing.

38
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,860
And although a few hundred people that we know of might be into it, maybe even less

39
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,680
than that, and they're very vocal about it, the reality is that gaming on Linux is not

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,400
really as big a thing as a lot of people like to pretend.

41
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,280
I can't argue with your core point there.

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,300
But I think there are benefits to porting to Linux.

43
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,340
It's a great way to find performance issues that can actually improve your primary platforms

44
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,840
edition as well.

45
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,840
But if you base it around the correct technologies, like Vulkan, for example, instead of DirectX,

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:15,200
then future platforms like potential gaming Chromebooks, or Android, or even iOS and MacOS

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
with MoltenVK.

48
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,880
So you open yourself up automatically to just options if you adopt the right standards.

49
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,800
Although that does not necessarily apply in the case of Rocket League.

50
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,440
They've started development many years ago.

51
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,960
They're committed to the DirectX platform.

52
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,080
And then there's the other elephant in the room here.

53
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,880
And they even pointed out in an update that we'll have linked in the show notes, the reality

54
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,800
is Proton is a thing.

55
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,400
And they expect that it will continue to play under Proton.

56
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,740
They say it won't be officially supported.

57
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:48,080
But their argument backs up what you're saying, Joe.

58
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,800
It just doesn't make financial sense.

59
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:57,120
If natively 0.3% of customers are playing on Linux or Mac, and that 0.3% could use Proton,

60
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,760
or at least a good portion of them, how can you argue that?

61
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,360
You could just see that conversation going nowhere in some sort of meeting, and there's

62
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,920
really just no way to argue it.

63
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,040
It's just absolutely disappointing, I guess, as somebody who was a big fan of this initiative

64
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,000
many years ago, to see we're still at this point.

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,660
To be clear, you will still be able to play it offline after March, but you just won't

67
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,320
get any updates, and you're just going to be playing one player.

68
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,280
And some people have said, well, why can't they just make it so that at least Linux players

69
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,720
can play against each other online?

70
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,360
And that's just a naive question.

71
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,360
That takes resources to allow to happen, and there's still going to need to be some sort

72
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,640
of security updates and potential bug fixes, which is all costing them money, which they

73
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,720
just can't really justify.

74
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,960
But they are going to refund people, at least, and they're breaking the steam rule.

75
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,360
Normally, if you've had a game more than two weeks, or if you've played it more than two

76
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,400
hours, you can't get a refund.

77
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,240
But that actually didn't work at first, but they said they're sorting it out and you can

78
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,480
open a support ticket, so at least you can get your money back if you've bought it.

79
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,800
And this is a good reminder that it is a complicated path for developers to make a great game for

80
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Linux.

81
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,520
And if they haven't chosen the correct path, which hasn't always even been available, they

82
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
may end up here.

83
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,240
If they want to move the game forward, if it's a popular game and they want to move

84
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,040
it to a new stack of the technology they base their graphics on, a new set of APIs, there

85
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,520
could be other games out there like this, I don't know if it's directly an indictment

86
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,840
of the Linux platform.

87
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,640
Because I go back to my original point, if they had created this game in 2019 or 2018

88
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,720
and used Vulkan instead of DirectX 9, they may never be in this position.

89
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,800
There may be some influence from upstairs at Epic, but from their explanation, it simply

90
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,560
just comes down to updating from DirectX 9 to 11.

91
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,660
Yeah, it seems like a reasonable technical explanation to me rather than Epic buying

92
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,160
them and then shutting out the Linux players.

93
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,160
It's clear that if Linux had a larger player base, this wouldn't be such an easy argument

94
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
to decide.

95
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,760
They'd have to, like if it was, imagine just for a moment, just crazy here, but imagine

96
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,560
if it was 10%, then maybe they'd be a little less inclined to just cut it off.

97
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,280
But there's nothing we can do other than just get more people using Linux and then convincing

98
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,440
them to pay good hard earned money for games that are not free software.

99
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,120
Yeah, or convince devs to use open standards like Vulkan to make the games in the first

100
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
place.

101
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,920
And maybe Stadia will help that.

102
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
Who knows?

103
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,920
In the meantime, good old reliable wine that just continues to chug on decade after decade

104
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,800
has released version 5 now, which is remarkable because I remember discussing when version

105
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,160
1.0 came out.

106
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,240
But there's some major improvements in this new version of wine.

107
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,720
Yeah, a lot of that work on Proton from CodeWeavers is landing in 5.0.

108
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,760
Yeah, this has been a year in the works.

109
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,280
So a lot of stuff that has just sort of been accumulating hits here as the official release

110
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:07,200
also dramatically improved multi-monitor support, Vulkan 1.1 support, but maybe something that's

111
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,360
more significant, I don't know yet, is they've changed the way they build modules.

112
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,320
In the past, they built them in the ELF format, the executable linkable format, which is the

113
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,400
generic file format for executables and Linux systems.

114
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Instead of building it as an ELF, the modules have been built as the Windows PE format,

115
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,640
which is the Windows file format for executables.

116
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:37,640
And the reason why that matters is games and piracy checkers are looking for those differences.

117
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,820
And by wine shifting over to the Windows PE format, it's one less thing to trigger these

118
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,400
gotcha systems or any kind of detection system to realize it's not on Windows.

119
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,640
That's a major leap.

120
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,880
I have yet to test if it really makes a difference.

121
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,640
I'm definitely looking for feedback, linuxactionnews.com slash contact.

122
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,040
But all of the other features combined with this new executable format makes Wine 5.0

123
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
really impressive.

124
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,560
I really hope that means that gamers can get around this anti-cheat stuff because that

125
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,800
is one of the biggest concerns that I heard regarding the Rocket League news is that they'll

126
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,800
inevitably add some of that and then it will break it in Proton and then you'll be stuck

127
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,120
only using Windows to play it.

128
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,200
Yeah, that's exactly what I'd love to hear feedback on.

129
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,320
But Joe, what if you ever wanted to, I don't know, run a desktop application on an Android

130
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,320
device?

131
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,040
Maybe you don't have access to a desktop.

132
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
You only got Android.

133
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,480
Or maybe you're running Android on your desktop for some reason.

134
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,880
Yeah, maybe you're running Android x86.

135
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,640
This is something that I'd not really thought about much before.

136
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,880
But I read an article on XTA developers that pointed out that Wine is available for Android

137
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
as well.

138
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:46,360
Now, because Wine is not an emulator, as we know, it means you can't use x86 applications

139
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,160
on an ARM CPU.

140
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,960
But increasingly, we're seeing more of the Windows ARM stuff.

141
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
So it seems interesting.

142
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,980
I'm going to have to try this out, I think.

143
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,980
That's pretty slick, Joe.

144
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,320
But I'm more about running my Android apps in the cloud and Canonical might just have

145
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
something for me.

146
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,280
Yeah, and box cloud that they've announced this week with quite a lot of fanfare.

147
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,080
And unfortunately, not a lot of detail.

148
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,620
Oh, I get it.

149
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,620
What detail do you need?

150
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,980
It's Android apps in the cloud.

151
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,980
Actually think about it.

152
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,800
I see a couple of use cases for it.

153
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,380
It creates an on-demand experience for gamers.

154
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,200
So you could have phones that are lower specs, say free phones for certain carriers that

155
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,160
are still fully capable of running games.

156
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,700
You could even sell that as part of a monthly subscription.

157
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,520
This is a big way for carriers to say, hey, look at the capability of our 5G network.

158
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,440
But outside of gaming, I mean, think about all kinds of ways to test multiple different

159
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,340
types of virtual Android devices in the cloud.

160
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,400
You could have different, maybe even thousands of hardware configurations, and you spin it

161
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,240
all up at once and test your application and laugh in the face of fragmentation.

162
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,840
Yeah, I can definitely see a lot of use cases for it.

163
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:59,240
But what I couldn't seem to find was to what extent this is open source and how easy is

164
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,240
to run on premises.

165
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,600
I know they've partnered with packet to make it possible to run it on premises, but to

166
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,100
what extent are you going to have to rely on them?

167
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,840
It's just all a bit unclearly.

168
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,680
There's a lot of hype and business speak, but there's not a lot of detail about the

169
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,520
technical aspects of exactly how it's going to work.

170
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,000
If you have to ask that, then you can't afford it.

171
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't know.

172
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,920
You basically have to pay them, it seems canonical, to get this going.

173
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,280
I think it is very much a service, whether it be on premises or in their cloud.

174
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,560
I actually kind of like that in a way, that you have the option of having it on premise,

175
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,460
but still have the ease of management of something that's outsourced and taken care of.

176
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,240
Businesses and enterprises love that kind of thing.

177
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,720
I just love that.

178
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,960
So that's sort of in line, I think, with who the potential customer base is.

179
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:55,280
I don't think it's so much you or I individuals, but companies that want to build an experience

180
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
around this.

181
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:02,480
Again, I go back to the carrier image that comes preloaded with a stream Fortnite button.

182
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,800
Oh, yeah, definitely.

183
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:10,800
This is not aimed at tinkerers and people like me, but it's just a bit disappointing

184
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,720
to me because the good thing about everything that Canonical does is it is all open source.

185
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,960
Although yes, a lot of it is aimed at the cloud and enterprise, you can actually dig

186
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
into the code.

187
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,120
You can run it on your own test systems or whatever, whereas this seems to be...

188
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,600
Maybe I'm completely off base here, but just the way this has been marketed in a couple

189
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,800
of blog posts on the Ubuntu blog is like that doesn't really matter to them, and it's just

190
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,200
all about enterprise and cloud.

191
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,600
I could agree with that.

192
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,280
The only way I might change that is those details don't matter to the customer base

193
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,320
they're pitching this to, so they didn't write about it.

194
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Yeah, you're right.

195
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,200
And hopefully I'm wrong about this, and in the next few days we'll see some more technical

196
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
details of it.

197
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,440
But you know, look at this.

198
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:58,160
Anbox was originally written for the Ubuntu phone, which as we know, they abandoned and

199
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,240
the Ubiports guys picked it up.

200
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,160
But what we're seeing here is them pivoting that technology that they have originally

201
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:10,600
written to something that can actually make them some money here in the cloud as usual.

202
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,080
I had a similar thought when I read the story.

203
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:19,480
My thought was it's nice to see a real coming together of different canonical technologies

204
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,080
into a solid service offering.

205
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,480
And I think it speaks well for the company.

206
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,920
Take the service or its licensing aside, the ability to take an acquisition, take different

207
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,840
technology expertise, and layer a service offering on top of it with their Ubuntu Advantage

208
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,640
program additionally, because it's 1804 and LXD powering this whole thing.

209
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,940
So it really is, yeah, a coming together of everything, and then they've productized it.

210
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,080
It's I think a good sign for Canonical's ability to execute right now.

211
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,720
Yes, further evidence of them getting very serious about the business side of things

212
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
and actually making some money.

213
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,620
Google's getting a lot more serious about Chrome OS and education and is giving a pretty

214
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,480
generous update to the support of future devices.

215
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,620
This was a bit confusing this week because there was some reporting earlier on that suggested

216
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,720
that all new Chromebooks would get eight years of support, and then with various updates

217
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,540
and kind of a back and forth with Google, it turns out that some of the Chrome OS education

218
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:23,040
devices will be getting eight years of support, but not necessarily every Chromebook.

219
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
Right.

220
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:30,720
So previously, and I guess essentially still, most Chrome OS devices will receive six years

221
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,920
of software support, but Google is extending the length of time it plans to support new

222
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,160
Chrome OS education devices with security and platform updates.

223
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,880
So starting in 2020 with initially two devices, one from Lenovo and one from Acer, they will

224
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,940
get automatic updates until June 2028.

225
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,960
To pay for the additional support, Google is also increasing the price of its Chrome

226
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:58,480
education upgrade, which is a one-time license that school boards can purchase, which is

227
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,340
usually a pretty large scale.

228
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:05,880
So it's going from $30 to $38 per device, which doesn't initially sound like a lot,

229
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:12,280
but if you're buying 5,000 or 10,000 of them, it can add up.

230
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,200
But it means that investment also lasts considerably longer.

231
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,320
So I think when you look at the cost to support, it's a pretty reasonable price increase from

232
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
$30 to $38.

233
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
Yeah.

234
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,840
And you're not going to get eight years of support out of an iPad, are you?

235
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,240
You're going to get what, about five or six?

236
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Yeah.

237
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,040
I mean, they'll continue to use them for another five, but they won't be supported.

238
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,800
The other knobs Google is turning here to make these more attractive to educators is

239
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,200
alongside the new devices, they're adding new search features to the Chromebook app

240
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,560
hub that teachers use that make it easier for the teachers to find specific programs.

241
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,120
So they've tailored a UI for educators to find specific things.

242
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
But here's another one.

243
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,680
I don't know how this would have affected you as a child, Joe, but Google is rolling

244
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:02,640
out originality reports, a feature that has been beta testing.

245
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,140
It's designed to help detect plagiarism.

246
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:14,360
So it looks at, quote, helps both teachers and students spot plagiarism because it can

247
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,360
look at everything.

248
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,040
And of course it has the power of Google and they're feeding this machine all the time.

249
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,720
And then different teachers, when you assign them like an English teacher role, get access

250
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,080
to these features, which will start rolling out over the next month.

251
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,620
It's going to support multiple languages.

252
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,400
And you could see like as an educator, you'd be looking at that going, hmm, eight years

253
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,960
of support, helps with built in app search, takes care of a lot of the maintenance.

254
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,680
It's easy to shuck these things when they got to go.

255
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,640
And now it helps detect plagiarism and they keep adding features like this, really making

256
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,000
it ideal when you add in the management features and all that stuff too.

257
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,920
Plagiarism was not a problem when I was a kid because I didn't really have access to

258
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
the internet.

259
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
I had no Wikipedia.

260
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,720
The only thing I had was Altavista on school computers.

261
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,080
So I wrote all my own essays.

262
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Thank you very much.

263
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,080
No cheating from me.

264
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,440
I may have done it once and it may have been one of my best graded papers, but I was a

265
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
pioneer.

266
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,440
As long as the nineties, so I'll have to tell that story one day, but not today, no, not

267
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
today.

268
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
I really like to see this.

269
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,960
I, I'm not a huge fan of Chromebooks in schools, but I'm also a pretty big fan of my text dollars

270
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,240
being used effectively and eight years of support is pretty reasonable.

271
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,760
I've seen sectors of the industry where some systems have 30 years of support.

272
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,200
I know it's not reasonable, especially for education devices because students are very

273
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,780
hard on them.

274
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,640
So eight years is a pretty reasonable compromise.

275
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,360
Do you really think that any of these devices will last eight years in the hands of kids?

276
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,640
It seems very unlikely to me.

277
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Possibly not.

278
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,600
I could also see different sellers that come up with agreements with the different districts

279
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,940
to do replacements and swaps.

280
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,960
And the thing is too, when you buy 5,000 of these, you end up with a few hundred in the

281
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,820
IT department that you can use for Frankenstein parts and you can keep machines running for

282
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,960
a really long time that way.

283
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Yeah, true.

284
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,560
It's about having a reference device that if you're going to replace them and then it's

285
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,620
not something completely different.

286
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:15,880
So there is a very clever strategy by Google to basically take on Apple in education and

287
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,840
Microsoft to some extent, but it also rubs me a little bit the wrong way.

288
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:25,720
I suppose I'd rather have them use Chromebooks than iPads.

289
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:30,200
At least it's a bit more like a proper computer and you can get a terminal and stuff on there

290
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
if you want to.

291
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,540
I mean, there's reality and then there's what I'd like.

292
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,520
In Chris's world, Endless would have some sort of massive education deal and just be

293
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,720
a total dominator in the education space.

294
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,000
And these students would be using Linux technologies with endless hardware and an endless desktop,

295
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
which I think would be great for schools.

296
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And that would be the education workstation of children of the future.

297
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,840
But we don't live in that fantasy world.

298
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,400
We live in a world where you need a large corporation to make deals with large districts

299
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,080
and shuck and jive on prices with hardware manufacturers in between, they get squeezed

300
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,080
on both ends.

301
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,280
And yeah, that's the world we live in and Chrome OS is, well, I guess it's not Windows.

302
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
I don't know.

303
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,600
Actually, sometimes I wonder because at least Windows would be a local company, Microsoft's

304
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,600
in my backyard.

305
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,920
So yeah, I don't know, Joe.

306
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
I don't know.

307
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:26,360
But I do know that I have little faith that the Free Software's Upcycle Windows 7 initiative

308
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,360
is going to be successful.

309
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:34,540
Yeah, so the Free Software Foundation posted this article, Upcycle Windows 7, and talking

310
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,600
about how Windows 7 has reached its end of life now.

311
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,300
And the best thing that Microsoft could do is make it free software.

312
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,800
You could make the environmental argument because it would keep machines out of the

313
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,540
landfill.

314
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,560
And Microsoft's big on that these days.

315
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,160
They write on the Free Software Foundation post, we call on them to release it as free

316
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,680
software and give it to the community to study and improve as there is already a precedent

317
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,360
for releasing some core Windows utilities free software.

318
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,780
Microsoft has nothing to lose by liberating a version of their operating system that they

319
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,080
themselves have say it's reached an end.

320
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,520
You know, that's kind of, I mean, it doesn't take into account like intellectual property

321
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,040
agreements and the fact that there's tons of components of Windows that have been licensed

322
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,480
from third party creators and they don't want that open sourced, I suppose they can rip

323
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
all that out.

324
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,780
But where they kind of go a little bit off the rails with me, Joe, is when they get kind

325
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,920
of demandy, quote, we demand that Windows 7 be released as free software.

326
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,800
It's life doesn't have to end.

327
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,760
Give it to the community to study, modify and share.

328
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,000
And then to like try to make it as if you don't do this, then you don't love Linux.

329
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,560
They write, we want more proof that you really respect users and users freedom and aren't

330
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,320
just using those concepts as marketing when convenient.

331
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,760
Which like as if these two are related at all.

332
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:56,960
My question to you, is this a PR stunt or do they actually think this could work and

333
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,120
are sort of unaware of all of the legal entanglements that would exist with something like that?

334
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,680
That is a very difficult question to answer and I actually had a conversation with my

335
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,840
wife about this and she said that, yes, that's exactly what it is.

336
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,580
They're not really expecting Microsoft to do this.

337
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:21,480
This is just an attempt to create some debate and maybe move the Overton window slightly.

338
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,560
And it's not them just being completely deluded.

339
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
But I don't know.

340
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:31,300
I had really hoped that when Stallman left the FSF, they would get real and sort of become

341
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,160
a bit more, well, in touch with reality.

342
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,720
And this kind of thing suggests that maybe they're not either that or they're just doing

343
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,640
epic trolling because apart from the stuff that you've mentioned, there's of course the

344
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,160
issue that a lot of Windows 10 is based on Windows 7.

345
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:54,580
And not only that, to throw code over the wall is not straightforward.

346
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,420
You have to spend resources cleaning it up and there's probably some quite embarrassing

347
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,760
stuff in that source code.

348
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,180
So it just could never happen.

349
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,720
And they say the precedent and they link to the open sourcing of Calculator.

350
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,280
Now even open sourcing that Calculator was probably quite a big effort to clean the code

351
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,720
up compared to an operating system.

352
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,760
I just really hope this is them trolling for publicity.

353
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:24,240
I'll give you my most skeptical take on it is it's a grab for mailing list signups that

354
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,900
they can then pester for donations because they end with, we need your help to send Microsoft

355
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,900
a strong message.

356
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:39,060
We want 7,777 supporters to take a stand with us not just for ourselves but for future generations.

357
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,120
Please stand with us today and sign below to show your support.

358
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,060
Now you're not signing up for a mailing list about this in the future.

359
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,720
It's not like a change.org petition.

360
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,000
You are signing up for their primary mailing list.

361
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,520
So what it says right here.

362
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,320
This is the Free Software Foundation's primary mailing list.

363
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,560
Subscribers receive a monthly newsletter called the Free Software Supporter which includes

364
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:12,480
news about the FSF activities over that month as well as other news and requests for donations.

365
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,880
It's a grab for a mailing list signup and it sounds like I'm being really skeptical

366
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,800
but the reality is for an organization like the Free Software Foundation that mailing

367
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,760
list is their lifeblood.

368
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:32,880
It is extremely valuable and they've gotten 4,111 new subscribers thanks to this already.

369
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,880
And maybe that's a good thing.

370
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,320
Maybe we need more people hearing the good news about the foundation and free software

371
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,060
and maybe it just takes a slightly disingenuous campaign to get them the good word.

372
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,780
I don't know how I feel about that but I guess you could justify it that way.

373
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,760
That sounds a little disingenuous to me though.

374
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,120
Well, to be fair to them you don't have to sign up to the mailing list to sign this petition.

375
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,880
There's a checkbox which says sign me up which you can just leave unchecked.

376
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,000
So of those 4,000 odd people who have signed who knows how many did check the box.

377
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,040
It's kind of your instinct to check the box.

378
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,320
Well because the way it's arranged it's like you're not done unless you check that box.

379
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,280
That's what it kind of looks like but you can sign up without it.

380
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,240
Yeah and you're right and perhaps a lot of people do and maybe it has nothing to do with

381
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,840
the mailing list at all and they just happen to put that in there because what a great

382
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,800
opportunity but when I look at all and I look at the likelihood that this is going to succeed

383
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:35,480
and if I want to believe that the people running the foundation are intelligent and I do want

384
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:40,280
to believe that then I have to believe that they know this would never happen because

385
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:47,160
of like you said current products are still based on the source code and legal entanglements

386
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,440
not to mention the support costs and Microsoft because of their stature in the industry would

387
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,040
need to do it properly so it need to be staffed and it's just never going to happen right

388
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,040
and then you combine that with this sort of jab at the end that's designed to really rile

389
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:05,040
people up and then this mailing list sign up which is right here right where you signed

390
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:10,720
where you're signing the petition that's the checkbox and then you hit submit.

391
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,560
I don't know could be could be totally wrong on this one but I just don't like the feel

392
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:21,040
of it and I like you was indeed hoping for a change in tone and this is a little silly

393
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,760
but I guess it raises awareness.

394
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,680
Well we're talking about it it's interesting though that they've edited the original post

395
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,120
because when I first read it there was language in there talking about how Microsoft had poisoned

396
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,980
education and it seemed like if you really want them to do this then that's not the way

397
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:42,520
to go about it and maybe after people pointed that out they cleaned it up I don't know but

398
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,800
yeah I have to believe you I want to believe that this is just a way to draw attention

399
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,400
to the FSF and to try and get people to sign up so ultimately they can get some donations

400
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,920
and keep going.

401
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:00,400
You would kind of expect any other organization of this nature to try to take advantage of

402
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,240
industry news to raise awareness to what they do I mean that might just be considered part

403
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,240
of the business.

404
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,920
I'll tell you what though if it ever happens I'll be the first to go on air and talk about

405
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,320
it you know what I mean like could you imagine and also would it be good for Linux if Windows

406
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,920
7 was open sourced and you could run Windows 7 and get it continued to be patched and fixed

407
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,160
and improved would that be good for free software I guess?

408
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,280
Well yeah because in of itself would be free software.

409
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:35,260
For a single free software project yes it would be a software project that is free but

410
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:40,180
the other free software out there may suffer I mean I don't I don't know if I actually

411
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:45,160
want Windows 7 available to the community let's a lot of nice things have happened on

412
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,440
the Linux desktop since Windows 7 and I wouldn't want to lose that.

413
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,360
Well imagine how good this would be for the wine project.

414
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,360
Yeah imagine how good it would be for all kinds of different individuals I mean for

415
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:00,960
sure now I guess for overall for for humanity Joe it would be good and I'd give it a go

416
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,280
I mean I love React OS I think that's a lot of fun so I'd probably give it a try.

417
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,960
Yeah imagine React OS but actually works.

418
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,120
Well you know if it happens we'll talk about it right here and we have an episode every

419
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,320
single week telling you what's gone down in the world of Linux and open source and you

420
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,740
can get new episodes by going to linuxactionnews.com subscribe for all the different ways to get

421
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,740

424
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,080
you can jump right in one of my favorite episodes in a long time and I love the conversation

425
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,560
around improving Linux conferences so check that out error.show slash 83.

426
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,080
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

427
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,600
I'm at Chris LAS.

428
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,240
I'm at Joe Rissington.

429
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,560
Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next week.

430
00:26:51,560 --> 00:27:09,960
Have a great day, have a great time.
