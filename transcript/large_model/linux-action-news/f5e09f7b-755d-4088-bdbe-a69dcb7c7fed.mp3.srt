00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,100
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,220
This is episode 58, recorded on June 17th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,220
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,220
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,220
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,340
I think this is my last episode from Texas, and we're kicking it off with one of my favorite

7
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:30,640
topics these days, a new release of the Plasma Desktop.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,120
Yeah, 5.13 is being released, and there's quite a few little improvements that have

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,920
sort of come together to make one big improvement.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,720
I think the things that really stand out in this release are the browser integration for

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,200
Chromium-based browsers and Firefox.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,680
Now the media controls and download status are integrated into the Plasma Desktop notification

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,680
areas.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,900
They've redesigned the system settings, and there's a few other things they've slipped

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:01:00,000
in there, like improved blur effects and early support for GTK global menu integration.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,480
So presumably you've upgraded to this on KDE Neon then.

17
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,980
Yeah, and overall, like all of the previous updates, it's gone pretty smooth with the

18
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:14,160
exception of one new bug that's already been reported, and I think work's already being

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,500
done to fix it.

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,040
But I don't know the exact circumstances, but on my system, which is a Dell XPS 13 with

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,160
a high DPI display, and I'm using the breeze dark theme.

22
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:29,060
When I click on the Wi-Fi menu, I get this cluttered huge icon list where I can't click

23
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,300
on the individual Wi-Fi connections.

24
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,760
The Wi-Fi signal icons are about 15 times the size they should be, and they're all sort

25
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,240
of jumbled in the list, which is a big bummer when you're on the road and you're switching

26
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,560
between Wi-Fi networks several times in a day.

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,100
It's become tricky.

28
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,480
The quick workaround for me has been to just go into the Wi-Fi settings area itself and

29
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,840
just connect in there and not use the pop-up menu.

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,880
Others have said they can clear caches and it seems to resolve it.

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,240
Hasn't fixed it for me.

32
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,520
Outside of that one problem, though, this must be the third release I've upgraded on

33
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,480
the Dell XPS 13, and I just love it.

34
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,240
I just love having this fresh plasma, and it reminds me that Kubuntu is great for those

35
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,680
of us that need to use their system in production.

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,160
All of my studio machines, Kubuntu 18.04, all day, and it isn't getting this 5.13 release

37
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,160
of plasma.

38
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,480
But if you're on Neon or some of the rolling distros like Arch or OpenSUSE, you might give

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
it a go.

40
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,960
With that exception of that Wi-Fi menu bug, it's pretty solid, and the performance is

41
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,160
noticeably better.

42
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,520
But it is possible to enable it via PPA on Kubuntu 18.04, but presumably you're not going

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,280
to be doing that on the production systems then.

44
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
Oh, yeah, that's right.

45
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
I forgot about that.

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,560
Yeah, that could be another way for folks to go.

47
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720
I don't know if I'd recommend it yet.

48
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
I'm not doing that.

49
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,640
I'm going to stick with the LTS release of plasma on Kubuntu 18.04, which is also an

50
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,640
LTS.

51
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,360
That was one of the things that really attracted me to it, so I'm going to stick with that

52
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,880
supported LTS version.

53
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,200
You're pretty much all in on plasma these days, aren't you?

54
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Yeah, I really am.

55
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,140
It's been sort of the star of the road trip, because not only have I used it for every

56
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,960
single show that I've done on the road, but I converted a couple of people from Nome at

57
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:14,120
Linux Academy over to the plasma desktop, including Anthony, the CEO himself, who's

58
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,160
giving Kubuntu a go next week.

59
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,360
So I kind of became a bit of a pitch man while I was there.

60
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
Who, me?

61
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
Never.

62
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,840
Well, yeah, there's this video showing off all the features, and it's pretty good apart

63
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,840
from the voiceover.

64
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
I didn't think much of that one.

65
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,840
Yeah, no.

66
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,320
You know, I think that guy was in his RV or something.

67
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
You can kind of...

68
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
It sounds a little weird.

69
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,320
Yeah.

70
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,320
That was weird.

71
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,520
I just pressed play, and the last one was Michael, so I was kind of expecting him again,

72
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,240
and it was like, oh, wow, yeah, there's Chris talking about that.

73
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,240
He'll probably be back in the next one, I would imagine.

74
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,200
I think he was crunched for time because he was itself.

75
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Right.

76
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Yeah, yeah.

77
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,360
Well, it's a very slick video, though, isn't it?

78
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,000
The visuals of it and everything, it's very well put together.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I completely agree.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,440
The video's great, and I am really happy to see Nome doing that, as well as a few other

81
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,440
open source projects.

82
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,640
I think it was just a few years ago, I was sort of strongly advocating that projects

83
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,700
should do this to really showcase the good work they're doing, but also as a user of

84
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,360
these desktops, they do so much, even Nome, that it's nice to be reminded what's new,

85
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,920
and it was because of that video that I went over and got the Plasma integration extension

86
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,640
for my Firefox browser, and now I'm really liking that media player stuff because when

87
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,960
I'm on the air, like if something starts playing, I don't even have to go into my browser.

88
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,760
I can use the play pause keys on my keyboard that control the Plasma widget, which then

89
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,020
stops the browser.

90
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,360
So it's even faster now, I can stop an interruption, it's a great feature.

91
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,120
And I didn't really grok it until I saw that video.

92
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,800
And as usual, it's just slow and steady improvement to me.

93
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,480
It's almost tempting to switch over.

94
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,320
I must say, every new release of Plasma that comes out, I think, hmm, maybe I should jump

95
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,080
ship, but then I think, no, no, XFC is good enough for me, thank you very much, but it's

96
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,440
certainly a potential backup for me, I must say, and I'm tempted to put it on just one

97
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:08,680
or two systems that I don't use very much, just to give it a really good go, but I don't

98
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,720
want to move away from XFC, I'm too scared of change, I think.

99
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,160
I'm going to just admit that it's a lot to take in.

100
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,200
There's just so much going on with Plasma Desktop, and that's what I love about it,

101
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
actually, that there's so much going on.

102
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,600
But it takes a bit, it took me three times.

103
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,340
This was my third time that it actually stuck for me, because each time I got a little more

104
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,400
familiar with it, and I'm going to put a call out there, if anybody in the audience has

105
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,480
like a guide or could write up a quick, like, text-based how-to to configure Plasma Desktop

106
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,180
as close to, like, the default Xubuntu desktop, go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact and

107
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,400
send that in, because I bet you there's some maniac in the audience that has configured

108
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,240
his Plasma Desktop to look exactly like Xubuntu.

109
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,840
Yeah, well, the only thing is I want the panel on the bottom, though.

110
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,480
Gotta have the panel on the bottom, mine's on the bottom, gotta be on the bottom.

111
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,160
Yep, old XP style, thank you very much.

112
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,160
Speaking of being on the bottom, Mycroft's been on the bottom of personal assistance

113
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
since the beginning.

114
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,400
They've been behind, and now they're reaching out to the community once again to try to

115
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
pull ahead.

116
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,120
Yeah, but instead of doing a Kickstarter or IndieGoGo crowd funder, this time it's an

117
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,440
opportunity to invest in Mycroft.

118
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,880
And it's not just VCs anymore, anyone can invest for the low, low price of $250.

119
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,600
Joe, have you been frustrated that you've been left out of the wealthy VC game for a

120
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,600
long time?

121
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,640
You know, it's been kept to accredited investors and wealthy individuals who make more than

122
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,480
$200,000 per year and have more than a million in assets.

123
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,960
Well, if you've been frustrated that they haven't been able to accommodate you, well,

124
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,240
that's all changing now.

125
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,600
Yeah, well, if I was going to invest in something, I'm afraid it would not be Mycroft.

126
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,400
Because you know, the voice assistants are booming, there's no doubt, but I am personally

127
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
not convinced by them.

128
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,920
I mean, you are all in on the Amazon one.

129
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,800
And when you're back in the studio, everything's automated with that.

130
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,500
And you presumably would like to have that be totally open source, but Mycroft, how much

131
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,440
money are they going to need to be able to compete with the likes of Amazon and Google

132
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,680
and Apple on this stuff?

133
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,060
Millions and millions.

134
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,640
They point out in their own post, which by the way, I was reading from earlier as well,

135
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:23,360
that they say to build the Echo, our friends at Amazon made three acquisitions and assigned

136
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,680
hundreds of employees to the project.

137
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,040
Here at Mycroft, we have a benefit of a great community, but we need additional resources

138
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,440
to achieve that goal.

139
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,280
Right there, right there, they're basically saying, we can't do this unless we can scale

140
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,520
the way Amazon did.

141
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,760
It's sort of an impossible goal at this point.

142
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:48,120
And the problem is, I think we actually too often focus on the lady tubes from Amazon

143
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,280
or from Google, but I think the real competition is the ones that are baked into the phones

144
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,780
and the ones that are baked into TVs like the Google Assistant can be, because those

145
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,560
are creating something that's going to be called ambient voice assistants.

146
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,040
I'm coining that term, ambient assistant.

147
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,720
What happens, especially in the case of the Siri ecosystem, is if you have a couple of

148
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,540
iPhones and iPads in your house and then you get a HomePod, what essentially happens because

149
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:21,080
of all of the great microphones on those different devices, anywhere you are, when you say the

150
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,980
perfect incantation to that device, they essentially activate anywhere in your house.

151
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,320
And there's an immediate Bluetooth network the moment you say those words that is created

152
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:35,880
between all of the devices and they vote which one is the closest and then that device responds

153
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,880
to you.

154
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
You never think about it.

155
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,080
It all happens instantaneously, even devices that aren't yours.

156
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,320
So if you have a partner who has a separate iCloud account, has a completely separate

157
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,200
phone, they still participate in this Bluetooth voting and it's creating this ambient network

158
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,840
of virtual assistants.

159
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:59,320
And that's the real competition because that's using the platform.

160
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,520
That's Google with Google Assistant and Apple with Siri.

161
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,440
And that's what really is the competition, not the single tubes.

162
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,760
Tubes are part of it, but they're just one part of this whole ambient assistant that's

163
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,520
going to take over everyone's homes.

164
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,080
It's already there if you have a phone.

165
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
It's already there.

166
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
It's already happened.

167
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,040
It's just you only have one or two microphones at this point, but there will be more.

168
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,040
Right.

169
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,480
And so they can't possibly help to compete with that, even if they got millions in investment

170
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,520
here.

171
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:32,480
So maybe they would be better off going down the open source privacy route and saying that

172
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,240
this thing's going to work without access to the internet.

173
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,520
It's going to be totally based on your LAN and you're going to be totally private.

174
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,960
Maybe that would be the way to do it.

175
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,360
And then people would accept that the voice is not going to be as good.

176
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,240
I mean, it was almost laughable in this post by the Mycroft CEO saying that their goal

177
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,040
is to have Mycroft be indistinguishable from a human being.

178
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,320
And so you wouldn't even know you're talking to a robot.

179
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Oh man.

180
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
That is such a pipe dream.

181
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:07,000
I mean, even the Amazon and Google and Apple ones, you can blatantly tell.

182
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,320
I mean, it's a great voice from them and you can understand it perfectly, but they are

183
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,640
years away from that being indistinguishable.

184
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,280
I mean, I know Google did that demo and everything that got headlines, but duplex.

185
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:24,420
Yeah, but it's that feels a long way off even for the big players.

186
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,320
So to be talking about that, it's just a pipe dream, isn't it?

187
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,320
Definitely.

188
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,080
And I like your idea of just going the opposite direction because you said something early

189
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
in our conversation.

190
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,040
You said you've got the echo tube, but if it was open source, you'd be using it.

191
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,200
If it had 10% of the functionality and it was open source, if it could still turn my

192
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,920
Wi-Fi devices on and off and issue those commands, I'm good.

193
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,440
Really, I'm good.

194
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,820
And that's why I really think if they could focus on the offline or the small scale office

195
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,960
deployments where this could be great in a small business.

196
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,300
Imagine you walk into a conference room and you can set up the projector and the lights

197
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,560
and all of that, the temperature, everything with your voice.

198
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,140
You never have to train staff on how to use any of the devices in that room.

199
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,920
They just bark into the air and it happens.

200
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,360
There's really no reason Mycoff couldn't do that because you could build special recipes

201
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,440
just for your office environment, name your devices that you have them named, the quirky

202
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,300
little office name that you have for them.

203
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:27,120
And that could be the piece that they own, enterprise and business and privacy nuts like

204
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
us.

205
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,640
And they could open source as much of this stuff as they want because they're not even

206
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,140
competing with the echoes of the world.

207
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:41,460
But this idea that they could topple Amazon at this point or Google or Apple is ludicrous.

208
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,760
It's ludicrous.

209
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,200
It's like somebody launching a device right now saying they're going to topple Android.

210
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,200
It just would be laughable.

211
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,220
Yeah, you've got to find somewhere else to compete.

212
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,440
And for me, the main feature would be nothing leaves your land.

213
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,900
If they could say that, then that's going to be hugely attractive to a lot of people.

214
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,580
Just make sure that if you're deploying it on your land in a Docker image that you check

215
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:08,180
where that image came from because recently it was discovered that backdoor Docker images

216
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,500
were downloaded five million times from the official Docker hub.

217
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,080
This does not look good for Docker hub, does it?

218
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,620
Especially given that they were reported within a few weeks of them first going up and they

219
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,500
did nothing about it for months.

220
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
Yeah.

221
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,620
And the thing that's really sort of like insult on top of injury is that the user account

222
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:35,100
that these, I think, 17 different images got published to was docker123321.

223
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,020
Obviously just like a rando account that somebody threw together that if a human being even

224
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,660
looked at it for 10 seconds would be a little suspicious.

225
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,140
But the way this hub stuff works, if you guys aren't familiar with, is anybody can publish

226
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,700
to the hub.

227
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,420
And the idea is kind of great because it means some rando sysadmin could really solve a problem,

228
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,160
put it all up in a Docker container and put it on the hub and now thousands of other sysadmins

229
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,100
or developers or whoever can take advantage of that person's cleverness.

230
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,780
That is a great idea.

231
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,260
And then the whole theory is a sort of reddit dig style.

232
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,560
The votes and the comments and app store review style stuff filter out the good and bad.

233
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,220
But as we've all experienced on Amazon and Google Play and Apple's app store, it never

234
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,220
works like that.

235
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:26,460
So of course, images with oh, I'm sorry, it was I believe 14 images, 14 images with malware

236
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,500
in them, in this case, crypto mining malware just went up and some of them got some pretty

237
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,220
large deployments.

238
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
It just sits there.

239
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,080
And because Docker is probably not paying people to go through the hub full time, even

240
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,380
when people start speculating in different avenues that there might be something wrong

241
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,040
with these images, like Joe said, nothing happens.

242
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,880
It's funny that when you and Wes were talking about this on the latest tech snap, I just

243
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:56,300
kept thinking you could substitute Docker hub for the snap store, you know, because

244
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,540
that again, anyone can upload to it.

245
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:01,620
And yes, okay, they have confinement and everything.

246
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,540
But we've actually seen crypto mining stuff on there as well.

247
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,380
And yes, it was dealt with very quickly and everything.

248
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,800
But I think that this is a growing problem.

249
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,220
If you have an app store that anyone could upload to, then you can't necessarily trust

250
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,300
everything that's in there.

251
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:23,020
And then it becomes up to the user to assess who has uploaded it and see whether they trust

252
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,020
them.

253
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,140
And this seems to be a major problem to me.

254
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,580
I think with Docker, it's probably less of a problem because the kind of people who are

255
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:38,540
using that are going to be sysadmins and people who are very technical, but with snaps, it's

256
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,420
a very different story, isn't it, because that is aimed at everyone.

257
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:48,740
I would say because of docker's huge scale deployment, I mean, mega scale deployment,

258
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,260
there's probably a lot more noobs installing Docker images than snap.

259
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:58,140
Snap's sort of a little newer, less widely known, so you probably have more sysadmin

260
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,740
knowledgeable people using them at this point, I'm guessing, rampant speculation, obviously.

261
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:09,180
I think this is really true for any kind of software store or repo or even a website that

262
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,900
collates links.

263
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:11,900
This is an issue.

264
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,940
And so the thing that we have to just acknowledge here for a moment, and maybe it just sucks,

265
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,720
but this is the way the world works right now, is the onus is on the user to double

266
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,860
check this stuff.

267
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,060
And so that's why I think when you give users tools beyond just thumbing something up, it's

268
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,060
valuable.

269
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,780
So in the case of the Snap store, they're going to be adding verified publisher status

270
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,500
and things like that.

271
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,860
That is, even though it seems like an incremental improvement, is exactly the kind of tool you

272
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,540
can give a user to make an educated guess.

273
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,580
Now I wish I could sit here and tell you that using machine learning, artificial intelligence,

274
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,740
and Google duplex, they could suss out all of the bad software on the internet.

275
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,460
But the reality is it's just not going to happen.

276
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,660
So it's got to be on the user.

277
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,480
But the problem is, I think, is there is some responsibility all of a sudden when a corporation

278
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,660
begins to curate and manage something.

279
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,700
That's where it becomes a grey area.

280
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:08,700
Well, that's the thing for however many years we've been using Linux 20 plus, we've had

281
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:16,240
curated repositories that have been the responsibility of the distro in question, whereas now we're

282
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,900
moving away from that model, more towards the old fashioned Windows style where it's

283
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,380
just random binaries downloaded from the internet.

284
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,620
And okay, it's not quite the same and it's not as bad.

285
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,980
But for me, that is a step backwards.

286
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:36,380
I can see why these things are solving problems, but it's still a step backwards.

287
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,140
I wish there was some better way to do it.

288
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:45,300
And verified publishers seems to be the very best solution that we have right now.

289
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,260
Funny enough, in a lot of these cases, it always could have been worse.

290
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,540
It always seems to be Monero.

291
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,260
In fact, we'll have a link in the show notes.

292
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,180
Around 5% of all Monero currency in circulation right now has most likely been mined using

293
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,180
malware.

294
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,820
Monero Project themselves, you know, the group, the collective, can really only account for

295
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,860
about 20% of the overall hash rate.

296
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:10,300
They really can't account for about 80% of it, so I just love Monero.

297
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:17,780
And it's just like, of course, of course these Docker images were mining Monero.

298
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,540
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

299
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,500
You go there to support the show and you can sign up for a free seven day trial.

300
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Yeah, unplugged.

301
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,300
We stole it from those jerks over at the unplugged show.

302
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,780
I want to tell you about Linux Academy because it's a platform to learn everything about

303
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,820
Linux and all of the stuff that runs Linux.

304
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:37,420
And that includes these days, things like OpenStack and Azure and AWS and Google Cloud.

305
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:42,460
And of course, the basics of Linux, Red Hat certifications, the whole empire that is Linux

306
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,100
now, and they create courseware for it.

307
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,500
Now back in April, I told you that they were launching 70 plus new challenges, coursewares,

308
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,780
they were improving old content, new videos.

309
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,900
I was like, this is a huge release.

310
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,060
70 new bits of content and whatnot.

311
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,100
Well in July, it's gonna be 150 new ways to learn.

312
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,460
So you can start to see if you've been a subscriber for

313
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,340
a little while to Linux Academy.

314
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,340
You just continually get value out of your subscription.

315
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,860
And I'm really excited for them because I started to get a little bit of the scuttle

316
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,460
butt while I was down there at Linux Academy about some of the stuff they have

317
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,860
in the works for July.

318
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,580
What they're committing to is 150 new bits of content.

319
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:24,500
That's like challenges or courseware or all that kind of stuff.

320
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,980
Red Hat certification exams, Azure exams, they're launching security exams and

321
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,220
training courseware, it's a big push.

322
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,780
And the thing is, is that they're not standing still.

323
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,820
While they're working on that, they're already working on the next phase.

324
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,460
They have folks on board that are going through and updating the old content.

325
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,180
And the thing about Linux Academy is you can get the whole suite.

326
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,780
Like if you wanna go in and follow an entire track and

327
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,980
learn up on a whole new area of IT, you can do that.

328
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,140
But if you just need to know something specific,

329
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,980
like a deep dive into a single topic, they have that functionality as well.

330
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,900
And if you're busy, they've got a scheduling tool that helps you put

331
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,220
a time frame on your learning, and then they help you stick to it with goal

332
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,580
reminders, quizzes, things like that.

333
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,300
It's a pretty great system, and I encourage you to go to linuxacademy.com

334
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:11,580
slash unplugged, and then click over to their blog and learn about the 150 bits

335
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,420
of new way to learn that are coming to Linux Academy in the month of July.

336
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,060
That's one of the reasons I was down there,

337
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,780
was to get their live stream system all up and running on Linux.

338
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,580
That way, they could stream announcements about the different aspects of this

339
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,420
content release in July.

340
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,460
But don't tell anybody I told you that, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

341
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:34,820
Okay, so let's talk about something that is brand new and

342
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:39,820
we've never spoken about before, and that is security problems with IoT devices.

343
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,820
No, well, knock me over with a feather.

344
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,220
Although this one is particularly bad because it really comes down to just bad

345
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,100
OEMs shipping either debug developer versions of Android, or

346
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,740
somehow having ways to turn it back on, which is just wreaking havoc on devices.

347
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,580
Yeah, why would they ship a device with ADB enabled?

348
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,300
It just doesn't make any sense to me, but it turns out that there are a lot of

349
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,700
manufacturers doing this, and that effectively gives you a root shell

350
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,740
on the devices, if you know what you're doing.

351
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:16,940
I mean, it's definitely the most in China, and North Korea, and South Korea,

352
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,100
and Taiwan, it looks like are on the list as well.

353
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:24,220
But the United States is on the list, so is Sweden, Russia, and Canada, and Israel.

354
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,980
So it is in Western nations as well.

355
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,660
But I think it kind of makes a little more sense when you consider that some of

356
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,300
these are set top boxes, like cheapo TV boxes,

357
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,580
that people are connecting to their devices to watch Kodi and stuff.

358
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,780
Yeah, that's true, they just knock them out really cheaply, and yeah,

359
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:46,660
they probably don't have any QA and probably need ADB to do certain things on

360
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,540
it and then just forget to disable it afterwards, yeah.

361
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:54,380
Yeah, but researchers also found that they were able to turn ADB back on on some

362
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,540
devices, which I didn't realize was actually possible, but they say it's

363
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,260
highly problematic, because it allows anybody without a password to remotely

364
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:07,780
access this device as root over port 5555, and then silently install software,

365
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,300
and of course, execute malicious functions.

366
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,620
And for whatever reason, these are listening on the network, and there is a

367
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:19,860
worm that is based on the Mariah Botnet code that is installing, you guessed it,

368
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:25,340
a crypto miner, and then spreading peer-to-peer via that port 5555.

369
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,220
Now, this had me a little bit worried at first, because I have ADB enabled on my

370
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,420
phone, just in case anything goes wrong or whatever, but thankfully, I don't have

371
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:38,740
ADB of a network enabled, which okay to have USB ADB makes sense, right?

372
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,900
You need to have physical access to the device to be able to do anything.

373
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,980
And if you have physical access to any device, all bets are off.

374
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,620
But to have ADB over the network, that is a pretty bad oversight,

375
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,300
shipping devices in that state.

376
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,740
Yeah, I agree, and it looks like right now, that worm I just mentioned,

377
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,220
it's mining cryptocurrency.

378
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:03,300
The researchers, as of June 5, saw about 40,000 unique IP addresses that were

379
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,940
infected, and it would be perhaps even wider spread if it wasn't for the fact

380
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,660
that there's a bug in the cryptocurrency mining software that makes it not work

381
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,580
on some processors.

382
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,340
Oh, man, it's just a complete tale of whoa, isn't it?

383
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:20,780
This race to the bottom and just no proper quality control,

384
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,460
and this is the result of that.

385
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,980
Yeah, and unfortunately, some of us that try to take action into our own hands and

386
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:30,620
solve the problem by maybe loading a different image or something like that,

387
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,740
perhaps have one less choice this week.

388
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,580
Yeah, Copperhead OS looks to be in pretty serious trouble.

389
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,940
Yeah, there's clearly some kind of dispute between the founders of the project,

390
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:46,380
and there is a, quote, open letter on Reddit that was written to the co-founder,

391
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,140
Daniel McKay, and it's essentially kicking him out of the company.

392
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:54,260
There is a pretty in-depth conversation over on lwn.net, which we'll link to in

393
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,260
the show notes, linuxactionnews.com, slash 58.

394
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,460
I hate to speculate, but it looks like there's been some sort of division

395
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,380
between the two.

396
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,540
Yeah, and when he left, he deleted his signing keys, which means that it's not

397
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,660
possible for them to push any OTAs again, which means that the whole point of

398
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:15,500
Copperhead OS being this security-focused version of Android, that just goes out of

399
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,860
the window, because if you can't update it, then it's not going to be secure, is it?

400
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,940
Yep, exactly.

401
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,860
I mean, it's really too bad, too, because I know a couple of people that have used

402
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:29,100
it for a while now, and they both really like it, and I don't know what to suggest

403
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,700
to them, because it sort of scratched a particular itch for them.

404
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,260
I mean, I know there's many others out there, but Copperhead OS was their choice,

405
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,740
and both of them had talked to me about how it seemed like they'd paid attention

406
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,620
to small things that other projects hadn't paid attention to, and they really

407
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,580
appreciated that.

408
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:46,540
But they're a company who are not without controversy in the first place, aren't

409
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,740
they, especially with their licensing model?

410
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:49,260
Yes.

411
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,060
Now, that is true.

412
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:55,820
So they do have this sort of, and I wouldn't be surprised if the revenue

413
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,420
aspect of this model is maybe at the core of the dispute here.

414
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:05,060
I hate to speculate, but there is some sort of legal entity as a company that

415
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,380
now has to be dissolved or split up.

416
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,940
I mean, there's more to the story.

417
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,100
Yeah, well, we'll have to keep an eye on what happens with this.

418
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:15,260
I suspect we're going to find out more about it over the next week or so, and

419
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,180
hopefully they can resolve it, but it doesn't look good.

420
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,580
But I suppose let's move on to something a bit more positive, and that is

421
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,220
Debian seeking artwork for their 10.0 release.

422
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,660
Holy smokes.

423
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,380
Debian 10.0, are you kidding me?

424
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,940
Yep, it's true.

425
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:35,660
I couldn't believe it, but I read it twice, it is true.

426
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,420
And they're calling it, as you know, Buster.

427
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,700
And so this is the spot in the Buster cycle where they want

428
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,060
to start taking in artwork.

429
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:48,140
And I like this line here that I thought was maybe a bit braggadocious,

430
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,780
but maybe was actually accurate.

431
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,140
They said, would you like to create a desktop look and feel that will be

432
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,060
seen by trillions of people?

433
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,340
Yeah, I think that was a little bit tongue-in-cheek, wasn't it?

434
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,260
To be fair.

435
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,180
Maybe, but maybe it could end up on a television show that is very famous

436
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,820
and is watched for generations.

437
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,260
And in totality, it could be trillions.

438
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,100
You never know, Joe.

439
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,340
Yeah, I hadn't thought about that.

440
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,820
But it's funny that the criteria that they're going to select this on

441
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,100
are that it must be the most Debian.

442
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,660
And they don't really say what that means, but it just has to be Debian.

443
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:28,060
Which I suppose if you are familiar with Debian, it does make sense.

444
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,540
Because it's not, dare I say, it's not super modern looking,

445
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,220
but it's also not really old looking.

446
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,580
They don't go for a fashionable look, do they?

447
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:44,060
They just kind of go for something that's fairly minimal and inoffensive.

448
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:48,740
Yeah, clean, simple, and a little bit of legacy, maybe.

449
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,100
Maybe put it that way.

450
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,060
Yeah, maybe.

451
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,180
Speaking of legacy, though, just sort of a heads up for those of you

452
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,740
that are still rocking the Pebble watch.

453
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,260
First of all, I salute you, and second of all,

454
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,860
you better go make sure all your Rebel account details are in order

455
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,420
and that everything is up to date.

456
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:08,580
Because the original Pebble services go offline June 30,

457
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,700
and you need to get everything moved over to the Rebel equivalencies

458
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,500
if you want to continue to use them and have your watch function.

459
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,740
This isn't actually open to the public yet,

460
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,740
but you can register in advance.

461
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,280
And they're going to hopefully switch the servers on just

462
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,820
in time for this switchover.

463
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,820
And not everything is going to be supported straight away,

464
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,380
but it's pretty much your only option at this point.

465
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,780
So you've got no choice.

466
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,300
Sign up for your Rebel account and get it ready.

467
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,060
I will put a link to that Rebel auth page,

468
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,500
as they put it, in the show notes so you guys can just click right to it.

469
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,660
I have a Pebble watch, and I gave it to my old man.

470
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,220
And now he rocks it, so I'm going to text him after the show

471
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,460
and make sure that he's doing this, because he loves it.

472
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,100
Yeah, I've got a first generation Pebble,

473
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,780
and I've dug it out of the drawer and charged it today,

474
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,420
so I will have to say about this as well.

475
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,020
Very nice.

476
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,020
