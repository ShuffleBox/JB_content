00:00.000 --> 00:09.480
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 261, recorded on October 5th, 2022.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.480
I'm Chris.

00:10.480 --> 00:11.480
And I'm Wes.

00:11.480 --> 00:12.480
Hello, Wes.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.560
Let's do the news.

00:14.560 --> 00:20.760
This week, IBM announced it was slicing off another part of Red Hat, loosely known as

00:20.760 --> 00:27.600
the Red Hat Storage Team, and transferring it to the IBM Storage Team.

00:27.600 --> 00:33.080
Stating in their announcement, quote, with the move, IBM will integrate the storage technologies

00:33.080 --> 00:41.640
from Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation, or ODF, as the foundation for IBM Spectrum Fusion.

00:41.640 --> 00:47.400
This combines IBM and Red Hat's container storage technologies for data services, and

00:47.400 --> 00:52.640
helps accelerate IBM's capabilities in the burgeoning Kubernetes platform market.

00:52.640 --> 00:58.240
Well, I can't speak to names like Spectrum Fusion and if Kubernetes is still a burgeoning

00:58.240 --> 01:03.440
platform, but in my opinion, IBM's focus on storage here, it's probably a savvy one,

01:03.440 --> 01:07.520
even if it's a bit alarming to some of us long timers.

01:07.520 --> 01:12.000
Storage really seems like an area that IBM still holds a lot of credibility in the industry.

01:12.000 --> 01:17.120
And it's been clear to some of us that OpenShift and the technologies around it, well, they

01:17.120 --> 01:21.480
were a significant motivating factor for that $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat a couple

01:21.480 --> 01:23.440
of years ago.

01:23.440 --> 01:29.600
And it truly is part of their whole hybrid cloud strategy that they're just so on about.

01:29.600 --> 01:33.200
And storage is obviously a big part of that.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.240
Ceph also, widely deployed, is part of this as well.

01:36.240 --> 01:41.820
But IBM says Ceph will remain 100% open source, and IBM will assume the premier sponsorship

01:41.820 --> 01:44.000
of the Ceph Foundation.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.600
But somewhat ironically, IBM made a big deal about Red Hat being a neutral vendor that

01:50.600 --> 01:55.840
would remain independent to eliminate any vendor lock in concerns while they're building

01:55.840 --> 01:59.240
out that bold hybrid cloud future.

01:59.240 --> 02:02.200
Those might have just been things you say during an acquisition because we got a new

02:02.200 --> 02:05.600
CEO now and those concerns are out the window.

02:05.600 --> 02:10.840
I mean, I recall right after the acquisition for a while, Jim Whitehurst must have been

02:10.840 --> 02:17.120
quoted a dozen times he became famous for saying, quote, Red Hat will still be Red Hat.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.680
How many times did we hear that?

02:18.680 --> 02:23.200
I guess the thing he just left off was there was an expiration date on that statement.

02:23.200 --> 02:29.920
And even more recently, on July 13th, 2022, IBM's CEO was asked about Red Hat, the CEO

02:29.920 --> 02:33.080
transition and the future changes coming to Red Hat.

02:33.080 --> 02:36.680
Speaking of Red Hat, new CEO just named.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.280
What changes will this bring?

02:38.280 --> 02:39.460
This doesn't really bring any change.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.320
This has been planned for a while.

02:41.320 --> 02:46.720
Look, Paul Cormier gave us four years since we announced the acquisition.

02:46.720 --> 02:47.720
He's not gone, by the way.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.880
He's still here as chairman.

02:49.880 --> 02:53.120
And Matt has been in his wings for a long time.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.760
Matt has worked for Paul for almost 16 years.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.400
So we shouldn't expect any significant change.

02:58.400 --> 03:04.400
And Matt was the leader behind our OpenShift strategy, behind containers for the last three

03:04.400 --> 03:05.400
years.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.200
He's been leading products inside Red Hat.

03:07.200 --> 03:11.520
So you should expect more of the same, more intensity, more of a doubling down on the

03:11.520 --> 03:14.000
winners, but not a significant change.

03:14.000 --> 03:19.760
Now, it seems perhaps those winners are being divided amongst the strongest departments

03:19.760 --> 03:22.480
within IBM.

03:22.480 --> 03:28.380
And with a tone that almost reads a bit like rewriting history, in the announcement materials

03:28.380 --> 03:36.140
provided in advance by IBM, they now state that, quote, IBM acquired Red Hat to become

03:36.140 --> 03:40.320
the world's number one hybrid cloud provider.

03:40.320 --> 03:47.080
Going on to say, IBM now offers the only open hybrid cloud solution to unlock the full value

03:47.080 --> 03:49.360
of cloud for our customers.

03:49.360 --> 03:55.080
Well, I think it's also notable that this, quote, acquisition wasn't announced maybe

03:55.080 --> 03:59.800
just a few days ago at Mobile World Congress, Las Vegas, where Red Hat announced OpenStack

03:59.800 --> 04:02.360
Platform 17.

04:02.360 --> 04:06.240
Staffers were there, exulting the virtues of integration of the OpenStack platform with

04:06.240 --> 04:10.720
OpenShift platform and seemed to really be all about the integration of the two.

04:10.720 --> 04:15.840
In fact, it's been suggested that the staff didn't even know about the news about essentially

04:15.840 --> 04:24.520
becoming IBM employees until hours before the public did.

04:24.520 --> 04:31.520
NextCloud Hub 3 was announced this week with three significant areas of development and

04:31.520 --> 04:35.120
a whole lot of performance improvements.

04:35.120 --> 04:40.920
But the change you might notice the most is what they're calling a fresh, accessible,

04:40.920 --> 04:42.720
and personalized interface.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.920
Yeah, there's a lot of work that has gone in there.

04:45.920 --> 04:51.560
And also to that end, a lot of work went into mouseless options, assistive software such

04:51.560 --> 04:58.880
as screen readers, light and dark modes, keyboard shortcuts, and a font for people with dyslexia.

04:58.880 --> 05:02.720
I suspect though the headline feature for many of our listeners who use NextCloud at

05:02.720 --> 05:05.560
home will be Photos 2.0.

05:05.560 --> 05:09.840
It's got a new UI for viewing and editing your photos.

05:09.840 --> 05:14.360
NextCloud Photos can also now automatically tag photos, recognizing things like cars,

05:14.360 --> 05:17.640
trees, food, faces, and a whole lot more.

05:17.640 --> 05:23.720
Plus it's going to group those in the people tab, allowing you to name them and naturally

05:23.720 --> 05:27.220
search for them based on those tags.

05:27.220 --> 05:32.700
And I suspect the headline feature for those using NextCloud in an organization will probably

05:32.700 --> 05:35.560
be the improvements to NextCloud Talk.

05:35.560 --> 05:38.800
It's looking very slack these days, and I mean that in a good way.

05:38.800 --> 05:43.520
NextCloud is touting its improved widgets that expand in chat for website links, videos,

05:43.520 --> 05:46.600
tasks, other things that are integrated in with NextCloud.

05:46.600 --> 05:52.320
And just Talk seems overall extremely integrated into many aspects of NextCloud now, making

05:52.320 --> 05:56.640
it a genuine collaboration suite for a group or a business.

05:56.640 --> 06:02.640
And to kind of round out what's seeming like a Teams and Office 365 killer all in one vibe,

06:02.640 --> 06:10.160
Mail 2.0 debuted with much improved performance, a whole new user interface, and streamlined

06:10.160 --> 06:12.040
account setup.

06:12.040 --> 06:17.000
The NextCloud team made special effort to highlight a range of performance and security

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
improvements.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.280
Just a couple of highlights for you are now end-to-end encryption performance impact was

06:22.280 --> 06:25.040
reduced by 75%.

06:25.040 --> 06:29.500
And also key management for users was introduced into the user settings.

06:29.500 --> 06:34.880
And server-side encryption's data usage was reduced by 33% in this release and it introduces

06:34.880 --> 06:38.560
support for S3 primary storage and group folders.

06:38.560 --> 06:43.280
I also think that there's some new integrations that are worth a quick mention here, including

06:43.280 --> 06:48.600
Zimbra and Open Project integrations that will probably be handy for some users.

06:48.600 --> 06:53.320
But I could really see our crew digging the new Google Drive integration that lets you

06:53.320 --> 07:00.180
import your Google calendars, contacts, photos, and files directly into NextCloud.

07:00.180 --> 07:03.920
If you're interested, we'll have a link to the full announcements in the show notes with

07:03.920 --> 07:11.560
screenshots of that shiny new UI.

07:11.560 --> 07:17.200
With NVIDIA recently open sourcing their kernel module, Jason Ekstran over at Collabrub, along

07:17.200 --> 07:23.400
with help from Carol Herbst and Dave Erlie at Red Hat, believe right now might be the

07:23.400 --> 07:27.440
ideal time to reboot the Nuvoo driver stack.

07:27.440 --> 07:30.880
And Jason is calling this project NVK.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.040
So what is NVK exactly?

07:33.040 --> 07:39.680
Well, it's a new open source Vulkan driver for NVIDIA hardware in Mesa.

07:39.680 --> 07:44.880
It's been written almost entirely from scratch using those new official headers provided

07:44.880 --> 07:46.960
by NVIDIA.

07:46.960 --> 07:52.480
But one of Jason's personal goals for this project is to become the new reference Vulkan

07:52.480 --> 07:56.100
driver within the Mesa code base.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.820
This mad lad, I love it.

07:57.820 --> 08:02.280
Jason says he's trying to build NVK to be as modern as possible.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.060
He's building with Vulkan in mind.

08:04.060 --> 08:09.140
He says in the announcement, quote, I'm building NVK with all the best practices we've developed

08:09.140 --> 08:12.660
for Vulkan drivers over the last 7.5 years.

08:12.660 --> 08:16.160
And I'm trying to keep the code base clean and well organized.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.340
That sounds pretty great to me.

08:17.340 --> 08:23.760
He then goes on to say, quote, long term, the hope is for NVK to be for NVIDIA hardware,

08:23.760 --> 08:26.360
what RADV is to AMD hardware.

08:26.360 --> 08:28.480
However, that's a pretty high bar.

08:28.480 --> 08:34.600
RADV is quite a mature driver with a lot of features and fantastic runtime performance.

08:34.600 --> 08:40.480
There's a lot of work between where we are now and RADV level driver quality, but it

08:40.480 --> 08:43.200
gives us a goal.

08:43.200 --> 08:48.280
And it seems like things are actually moving pretty darn quickly considering NVK has only

08:48.280 --> 08:54.500
been in development for just a few months and it's already passing 98% of the Vulkan

08:54.500 --> 08:57.120
testing suite.

08:57.120 --> 09:02.360
As for supported hardware, well, Jason says that currently they're targeting Turing

09:02.360 --> 09:06.500
Plus and he's using an RTX 2060 for testing.

09:06.500 --> 09:10.800
But with the Loveless cards coming out soon, he'll likely upgrade to one of those for

09:10.800 --> 09:17.540
development before too long.

09:17.540 --> 09:22.800
The results are in on Debian's general resolution vote regarding including non-free firmware

09:22.800 --> 09:24.800
in the installer image.

09:24.800 --> 09:29.540
And the winning option does indeed allow the installer image to include firmware necessary

09:29.540 --> 09:31.280
to use your system.

09:31.280 --> 09:36.220
The vote also changes the Debian social contract to make it clear that including non-free firmware

09:36.220 --> 09:39.300
in this manner is allowed.

09:39.300 --> 09:45.500
As one commentator on LWN said, quote, nobody is excited about binary blobs, but this is

09:45.500 --> 09:52.280
a huge step forward for usability.

09:52.280 --> 09:58.680
An alarming bug has been discovered in the Linux kernel version 5.19.12 and as a result,

09:58.680 --> 10:03.600
Intel laptop users are being advised to avoid that version.

10:03.600 --> 10:09.720
Intel Linux laptop users on Linux 5.19.12 have begun reporting white flashing display

10:09.720 --> 10:16.640
issues, with one user describing it as, quote, the laptop display starts to blink, like lights

10:16.640 --> 10:20.100
in a 90's rave party.

10:20.100 --> 10:24.840
An Intel Linux kernel engineer posted on the kernel mailing list, quote, after looking

10:24.840 --> 10:31.600
at some logs, we do end up with potentially bogus panel power sequencing delays, which

10:31.600 --> 10:34.640
may harm the LCD panel.

10:34.640 --> 10:41.760
As a result, Greg Hage has immediately released Linux 5.19.13, with the problematic Intel

10:41.760 --> 10:45.240
graphics driver patches reverted.

10:45.240 --> 10:50.160
Greg commented, quote, this release is to resolve a regression on some Intel graphics

10:50.160 --> 10:54.200
systems that had problems with 5.19.12.

10:54.200 --> 11:01.920
And if you do not have this problem, there's no need to upgrade.

11:01.920 --> 11:06.240
Linode.com slash LAN, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and it's

11:06.240 --> 11:08.360
a great way to support the show.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.520
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

11:10.520 --> 11:14.280
Developers trust Linode and Linux geeks love it.

11:14.280 --> 11:17.780
That's really how we've built and run everything that we deploy in the cloud for the last couple

11:17.780 --> 11:18.900
of years.

11:18.900 --> 11:22.560
Linode is even a huge part of the infrastructure that we use when I go on the road.

11:22.560 --> 11:25.960
And of course, Linode makes it possible for us to go on the road.

11:25.960 --> 11:30.040
I first discovered Linode at a Texas Linux fest.

11:30.040 --> 11:34.360
They were like, one of the few vendors that took this really early event serious and made

11:34.360 --> 11:38.440
it possible with both their support and just, you know, throwing bodies at it and being

11:38.440 --> 11:39.440
there.

11:39.440 --> 11:42.120
And I thought, you know, they're not getting a lot from this, but they are investing in

11:42.120 --> 11:43.120
the community.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.560
I thought that's, that's worth checking out.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.080
I put them on the back of my mind.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.220
Next time I'm building something, I'm going to try them out.

11:48.220 --> 11:49.920
And sure enough, I did just that.

11:49.920 --> 11:54.280
I tried out Linode for myself for my own personal stuff that I was building and I loved it.

11:54.280 --> 11:58.620
And when Jupiter Broadcasting went independent, Linode was one of the first names I called

11:58.620 --> 12:00.580
because I was such a happy customer.

12:00.580 --> 12:03.840
And now it's, you know what, it's been over three years.

12:03.840 --> 12:04.840
Wow.

12:04.840 --> 12:05.840
Wow.

12:05.840 --> 12:06.840
That's incredible.

12:06.840 --> 12:07.840
And Linode has been a big part of that story.

12:07.840 --> 12:12.080
Linode has been a big part of the story of us going independent and really the infrastructure

12:12.080 --> 12:16.080
we have built that has really been competitive is thanks to Linode.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.940
And they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the big hyperscalers that want to lock you into their

12:19.940 --> 12:23.740
crazy platforms where they got weird names for everything.

12:23.740 --> 12:25.720
And Linode has the best performance.

12:25.720 --> 12:29.360
This is shown over and over again by third party reports.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.280
You can find them online.

12:31.280 --> 12:35.340
I've done some testing myself and they have 11 data centers for you to choose from with

12:35.340 --> 12:41.020
great features like object storage, cloud firewall, and VLAN support that lets you span

12:41.020 --> 12:44.600
a private network across multiple regions with Linode.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.360
Some powerful stuff there.

12:46.360 --> 12:50.240
And of course, if you ever need help with support, if you ever need to do any data recovery,

12:50.240 --> 12:54.420
they have clear, easy to understand backups and your infrastructure management tools are

12:54.420 --> 12:56.220
going to work great with Linode.

12:56.220 --> 12:57.220
Just us.

12:57.220 --> 12:58.220
We do it already.

12:58.220 --> 13:01.180
So go build something, go learn something and try it for yourself.

13:01.180 --> 13:04.720
And it's a great way to support the show while you're getting a hundred bucks at linode.com

13:04.720 --> 13:05.720
slash LAN.

13:05.720 --> 13:09.320
Go get that 60 day credit, kick the tires for yourself and support the show.

13:09.320 --> 13:18.360
That's linode.com slash LAN, collide.com slash LAN.

13:18.360 --> 13:23.280
Collide is endpoint security that just uses the most powerful untapped resource in IT,

13:23.280 --> 13:24.520
the end user.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.640
When you're trying to achieve security goals, whether it's for yourself or a third party

13:27.640 --> 13:29.400
audit, maybe it's new leadership.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.400
I have been there.

13:30.400 --> 13:34.680
The conventional wisdom is to treat every device like Fort Knox.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.320
You know what I'm talking about?

13:36.320 --> 13:41.520
Old school device management tools like MDMs that force disruptive, awful agents onto employees

13:41.520 --> 13:46.600
devices that slows down performance and treats privacy as an afterthought.

13:46.600 --> 13:51.600
And let's be honest, sometimes introduces their own security vulnerabilities.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.240
That's the way things have always been done.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.880
And it turns IT admins and end users into enemies.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.220
It creates this weird energy.

13:58.220 --> 13:59.440
It's not good.

13:59.440 --> 14:04.640
And often it'll result in sort of like these shadow IT projects where somebody who knows

14:04.640 --> 14:08.720
just enough to be dangerous will help everybody get set up on Dropbox or something like that.

14:08.720 --> 14:13.280
And then you walk in one day and discover your users are all violating your policy.

14:13.280 --> 14:16.160
Collide does things differently.

14:16.160 --> 14:21.500
Instead of forcing changes on users, collide sends them security recommendations via Slack.

14:21.500 --> 14:25.520
Collide will automatically notify your team when their devices are insecure and then give

14:25.520 --> 14:29.440
them a step by step instruction on how to solve the problem.

14:29.440 --> 14:33.680
And by reaching out to employees via a friendly Slack DM and educating them about company

14:33.680 --> 14:39.880
policies, collide can help you build a culture in which everyone contributes to security

14:39.880 --> 14:42.920
because everyone understands how and why to do it.

14:42.920 --> 14:46.760
And for IT admins, collide provides a single dashboard that lets you monitor the security

14:46.760 --> 14:48.200
of your entire fleet.

14:48.200 --> 14:51.800
Maybe they're on a Mac, maybe they're on Windows, or maybe they're on Linux.

14:51.800 --> 14:56.060
Yep, you can manage it all and see at a glance which employees have their disk encrypted,

14:56.060 --> 15:01.120
their OS up to date, a password manager installed, and it just makes it easy to prove compliance

15:01.120 --> 15:05.120
to yourself, your auditors, leadership, customers, whoever it be.

15:05.120 --> 15:10.260
So that's collide, user centered, cross platform and security for teams that Slack.

15:10.260 --> 15:12.780
You can meet your compliance goals by putting users first.

15:12.780 --> 15:15.820
So visit collide.com slash land to find out how.

15:20.680 --> 15:25.160
trial there, they're going to give you a goodie bag that includes a free t shirt.

15:25.160 --> 15:28.300
So you don't even have to bump into us on the meetup to get some free swag.

15:28.300 --> 15:30.660
You just go to collide.com slash land.

15:30.660 --> 15:44.560
Well, it's finally here, Linux 6.0 has been released.

15:44.560 --> 15:49.920
After a rather funny back and forth debating if this latest version should be called 5.20

15:49.920 --> 15:50.920
or just 6.0.

15:50.920 --> 15:58.800
And while it's not quite as ambitious as it once looked, 6.0 does bring many new features

15:58.800 --> 16:06.680
from hardware to software, AMD and Intel hardware in particular have seen many additions.

16:06.680 --> 16:14.560
Boy have they that is impressive, but there was another really big finally in this release.

16:14.560 --> 16:19.520
The Raspberry Pi V3D kernel driver is in version 6.0.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.080
Thank you, Linus.

16:21.080 --> 16:26.160
It's also fantastic to see some improvements to XFS is scalability.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.540
Love that file system.

16:27.540 --> 16:33.720
We're also seeing a batch of new IOU ring optimizations and a new IOU ring block driver

16:33.720 --> 16:35.880
for user space.

16:35.880 --> 16:38.320
And just in time for fedora to take us away.

16:38.320 --> 16:43.960
We now have an H264 and HVAC media user space API that's been promoted to stable.

16:43.960 --> 16:49.400
Oh, don't worry, though, Chris, with the many vert IO improvements that landed in 6.0.

16:49.400 --> 16:54.840
I'm sure you'll be able to emulate some desktop that can play back basic media files.

16:54.840 --> 16:59.920
But hey, maybe you're doing it on a clevo machine, in which case your issues with touchpad

16:59.920 --> 17:05.960
and keyboard being messed up after suspending, well, that's now fixed.

17:05.960 --> 17:12.000
Also in 6.0, butterFS users get the send protocol V2.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.000
If you're not familiar, butterFS send and receive functionality generates a stream of

17:16.000 --> 17:21.120
changes between two sub volume snapshots, something that's super handy for taking incremental

17:21.120 --> 17:22.520
backups.

17:22.520 --> 17:28.160
The V2 protocol update adds support for directly reading and writing compressed data, which

17:28.160 --> 17:33.660
means no decompression on the send side and no compression needed on the receive side,

17:33.660 --> 17:37.000
at least if there's support on both ends.

17:37.000 --> 17:42.880
ButterFS with Linux 6.0 also now shows commit stats via sysfs, it's got various patches

17:42.880 --> 17:51.260
for zoned storage, and another big finally here, fixes for RAID 5 and 6.

17:51.260 --> 17:52.880
That's great to see.

17:52.880 --> 17:59.040
And we are just scratching the surface of what is new in 6.0.

17:59.040 --> 18:04.880
It's impressive to say this is a banner hardware release is putting like a mild tone on how

18:04.880 --> 18:07.640
much updates are in here.

18:07.640 --> 18:10.260
And don't worry, because we're not done.

18:10.260 --> 18:16.440
We already are following 6.1, which includes even more butterFS improvements and amongst

18:16.440 --> 18:18.480
a whole bunch of other things.

18:18.480 --> 18:22.840
The one that's going to get all the headlines, initial Rust support is confirmed for version

18:22.840 --> 18:24.760
6.1.

18:24.760 --> 18:28.960
So yeah, we'll be keeping an eye on all of that and everything else in the world of Linux

18:28.960 --> 18:29.960
and open source.

And this is the last Linux action news from the road.

18:47.480 --> 18:51.360
If you're curious what we've been up to and how our trip to NASA's JPL went, well,

18:51.360 --> 18:54.360
don't miss Linux Unplugged 478.

18:54.360 --> 18:59.920
And we'll be back next week with an in-studio Chris and all the latest Linux and open source

18:59.920 --> 19:00.920
news.

19:00.920 --> 19:01.960
Thanks for joining us.

19:01.960 --> 19:19.560
And that's all the news for this week.
