Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode one, two, three, recorded on September 15th,

00:08.480 --> 00:09.480
2019.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.480
I'm Chris.

00:10.480 --> 00:11.480
And I'm Joe.

00:11.480 --> 00:12.480
Hello, Joe.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.440
I didn't upset you with that introduction, did I?

00:14.440 --> 00:15.440
A little bit.

00:15.440 --> 00:16.440
It should be 123.

00:16.440 --> 00:17.440
I know.

00:17.440 --> 00:18.440
I know.

00:18.440 --> 00:19.440
I just, I had to do it.

00:19.440 --> 00:23.240
Well, we start out with some great news for users of the GNOME desktop.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.860
Version 3.34 is released.

00:25.860 --> 00:28.080
And this is all about performance, it seems.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.080
Yeah.

00:29.080 --> 00:34.400
It's got some last minute mutter patches that made it in just under the wire, as they say,

00:34.400 --> 00:36.880
as if there is such a thing in open source development.

00:36.880 --> 00:43.240
And it introduces some nice performance improvements in just sort of basic animation things.

00:43.240 --> 00:47.000
And some areas that turns out were just a minor correction.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.720
In one case, Joe, they were using GPU acceleration for a certain task.

00:51.720 --> 00:57.340
And it turned out that the CPU overhead to execute on the GPU was pretty considerable.

00:57.340 --> 01:02.340
And so by just taking it back to the CPU, they saved a ton of time and increased performance.

01:02.340 --> 01:06.600
Small tweaks now, some of which are coming right out of Canonical now that they're using

01:06.600 --> 01:08.920
the GNOME desktop as their default desktop.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.680
Yeah, I was talking to Will about that on late night Linux.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.320
And he said that it's amazing.

01:14.320 --> 01:18.440
It's night and day between 18.04 and 19.10.

01:18.440 --> 01:24.480
I haven't made the upgrade myself, but I've been using some patches from upstream on my

01:24.480 --> 01:26.800
current GNOME installation.

01:26.800 --> 01:28.400
And I've noticed an improvement.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.280
So it is really good.

01:30.280 --> 01:34.820
And when you have this now as the primary quote unquote enterprise desktop, seeing these

01:34.820 --> 01:38.880
kinds of performance improvements benefits more than just one distribution.

01:38.880 --> 01:41.620
This is something that benefits a lot of users now.

01:41.620 --> 01:46.500
It doesn't address some of the core concerns I have about GNOME's fundamentals.

01:46.500 --> 01:49.240
But it's great for what we have right now.

01:49.240 --> 01:53.540
And on top of these performance improvements, there's simple, nice quality of life improvements

01:53.540 --> 01:54.720
that are also landing.

01:54.720 --> 01:59.440
GNOME 3.34 introduced a custom folders area in the applications overview.

01:59.440 --> 02:02.880
So sort of like on a smartphone, how you can drop things inside a folder.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.620
You can now do that in the application overview.

02:05.620 --> 02:11.100
And Sysprof is making performance profiling of applications on the GNOME desktop even

02:11.100 --> 02:12.240
easier.

02:12.240 --> 02:16.880
And there's also multiple improvements to Builder, which include an integrated D-Bus

02:16.880 --> 02:17.880
inspector.

02:17.880 --> 02:21.560
All in all, though, this is telling a story that this is becoming an even more mature

02:21.560 --> 02:25.240
platform for developers, and a more mature platform for power users.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.520
Well, I actually did try this out.

02:27.520 --> 02:32.480
I installed Xubuntu 19.10, the daily image a couple of weeks ago, and I've been keeping

02:32.480 --> 02:33.480
that up to date.

02:33.480 --> 02:37.760
And I thought, well, why not just install the Ubuntu session on top of that, and then

02:37.760 --> 02:38.760
logged into it.

02:38.760 --> 02:42.840
And I don't know, it's just GNOME, I just can't get on with it.

02:42.840 --> 02:46.660
But I did notice on my little Vivo book that really isn't very powerful, that it was very

02:46.660 --> 02:48.720
smooth with the animations and everything.

02:48.720 --> 02:52.600
And it did feel faster than the last time I checked it out.

02:52.600 --> 02:57.720
But it's still just too fancy, too many animations, just not like a proper desktop enough for

02:57.720 --> 02:58.720
me, I'm afraid.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.920
Oh, yeah, all that polish is just, it's so frustrating.

03:02.920 --> 03:07.960
Well, yeah, the promotional video talks about how it's animation centric and everything.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.520
It's just not for me.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.080
But this is our flagship desktop.

03:11.080 --> 03:14.040
It's default on Ubuntu and Fedora.

03:14.040 --> 03:18.360
So it's important to get those things like the animations working really smoothly, because

03:18.360 --> 03:20.520
most people actually like that stuff.

03:20.520 --> 03:24.840
I take your point with the animations, because you convinced me to really tone it way down

03:24.840 --> 03:26.540
on my Android device.

03:26.540 --> 03:30.480
And I feel like that's made it perceptibly faster to me.

03:30.480 --> 03:35.520
And I've wondered why I haven't been compelled to turn off the animations on my iPhone, when

03:35.520 --> 03:39.680
I find it to be a net enhancement on Android, but I don't find it to be a net enhancement

03:39.680 --> 03:40.680
on iOS.

03:40.680 --> 03:45.640
In fact, they're, even for my taste, they're a little too, they're too long, the animations

03:45.640 --> 03:50.320
coming in and out of folders and closing applications and the application switchers, it could be

03:50.320 --> 03:51.320
a little bit faster.

03:51.320 --> 03:54.160
And I've wondered why I've turned them off for a little bit, and then I've turned them

03:54.160 --> 03:56.020
back on.

03:56.020 --> 04:00.020
And what I realized, it's sort of the same with GNOME versus Plasma for me.

04:00.020 --> 04:04.420
In GNOME Shell, the animations provide context.

04:04.420 --> 04:10.440
The applications overview and the way the windows open and close provide sort of a hint

04:10.440 --> 04:12.160
of functionality, what's happening.

04:12.160 --> 04:16.260
They give me a context of awareness on my desktop.

04:16.260 --> 04:20.680
On Plasma, I can turn it way too far, where things are just animated like crazy, and there's

04:20.680 --> 04:22.360
no real rhyme or reason.

04:22.360 --> 04:24.840
It's not a particular flow.

04:24.840 --> 04:26.540
It's kind of the same thing on iOS.

04:26.540 --> 04:30.740
When you close or open an application, they zoom in and out of the icon.

04:30.740 --> 04:35.420
They give you spatial awareness of where that's at, and there's a utility to it.

04:35.420 --> 04:39.620
And so when the animations provide functionality, utility, or even if they're just subconsciously

04:39.620 --> 04:44.520
giving me cues on how to navigate my UI, I find them useful.

04:44.520 --> 04:48.200
And when they're more candy, they're just extras that are just all over the place, no

04:48.200 --> 04:51.840
real rhyme or reason, over time, I just tend to turn them all off.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.200
I might try them for a bit, but then I turn them all off.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.860
And GNOME Shell's really struck that balance for me.

04:57.860 --> 05:00.920
The animations are minor.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.120
They're in the right place.

05:02.120 --> 05:03.440
They're smooth now.

05:03.440 --> 05:06.440
They don't seem like they detract from the experience.

05:06.440 --> 05:10.880
They provide some level of context to the experience, so I really like it.

05:10.880 --> 05:16.280
I'm still using XFCE on my workstation here in the studio, still using Plasma in the actual

05:16.280 --> 05:24.540
recording area, but on my laptop, I've switched over to GNOME Shell on Wayland because of

05:24.540 --> 05:30.300
the smoothness and richness of the whole UI, in part because I find these animations actually

05:30.300 --> 05:31.300
add to the experience.

05:31.300 --> 05:35.720
Well, I get it, and I get why people are into it, but I'm just not, I'm afraid.

05:35.720 --> 05:39.200
That's why there's more desktops than you can shake a stick at, Joe.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.200
Indeed.

05:40.200 --> 05:44.080
And if you're on a desktop that isn't GNOME and you want to update the firmware on your

05:44.080 --> 05:50.120
device and you want to use a GUI for it, well, there's now a release of GNOME firmware, which

05:50.120 --> 05:52.100
we talked about a couple of weeks ago, I think.

05:52.100 --> 05:57.720
We did indeed, and to keep things fun, it's just arbitrarily being called 3.340 to celebrate

05:57.720 --> 06:00.920
the new release of GNOME as well.

06:00.920 --> 06:02.560
I think that's great.

06:02.560 --> 06:06.680
It's just really kind of an indication this thing is ready to be used by end users.

06:06.680 --> 06:10.360
It's not going to be installed by default, at least right now, but it is available right

06:10.360 --> 06:11.360
now on Flat Hub.

06:11.360 --> 06:16.540
I loaded it up, and I guess I've seen it in the screenshots, but one thing I didn't expect

06:16.540 --> 06:22.120
when I put it in my actual system, it read all my hard drives and got all of their vendor

06:22.120 --> 06:28.080
information, their BIOS or firmware, whatever you want to call it, what kind of steps I

06:28.080 --> 06:30.600
have to take to do the updates to that particular device.

06:30.600 --> 06:36.120
But I guess I was expecting more like my traditional BIOS and just sort of completely forgot that

06:36.120 --> 06:40.000
my SSDs all have firmwares on them as well that need updating.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.520
So it's a pretty nice project just in that sense.

06:42.520 --> 06:44.480
You see a list of everything that's supported.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.360
You get firmware information.

06:46.360 --> 06:49.360
You get serial information, vendor information.

06:49.360 --> 06:50.360
It's a really handy app.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.960
Yeah, I tried it out, and it's very simple.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.440
It's not much to it.

06:54.440 --> 06:59.240
Unfortunately, the machine I tried it out on didn't have any devices that had any updates

06:59.240 --> 07:03.840
available for them, so I wasn't able to fully try it out, but I do like the simplicity.

07:03.840 --> 07:04.840
Did you flat pack it?

07:04.840 --> 07:05.840
Yeah, I got it off Flathub.

07:05.840 --> 07:06.840
Yeah.

07:06.840 --> 07:07.840
It wasn't too bad, was it?

07:07.840 --> 07:09.120
There's just a couple of commands to get it going.

07:09.120 --> 07:13.600
Well, yeah, but on XFCE, it did have to download about 300 megabytes of stuff.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.240
I don't even know what it was getting, but it worked.

07:17.240 --> 07:18.240
Yeah.

07:18.240 --> 07:22.480
I suppose you might have been missing some of the theme stuff.

07:22.480 --> 07:28.840
Also I noticed this week that LVFS announced that Acer has joined the group, although it's

07:28.840 --> 07:29.840
only one rig right now.

07:29.840 --> 07:32.600
Yeah, but you have to start somewhere, and hopefully this is going to mean that there's

07:32.600 --> 07:34.560
a bunch more machines coming soon.

07:34.560 --> 07:38.320
Well, Joe, it's not quite dead yet.

07:38.320 --> 07:43.520
Firefox is reintroducing the test pilot program that was shut down earlier.

07:43.520 --> 07:48.200
Yeah, they shut it down back in January of this year, but they've resurrected it seemingly

07:48.200 --> 07:50.680
as a way to try out their new VPN service.

07:50.680 --> 07:51.680
Brilliant.

07:51.680 --> 07:55.500
I think that's brilliant, because that's something people are interested in.

07:55.500 --> 07:59.400
So why not relaunch this program with a hot commodity?

07:59.400 --> 08:03.000
This has been a long, strange, twisted tale.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.600
It originally started as an add-on, I think, more than three years ago, and then eventually

08:07.600 --> 08:11.200
was baked into Firefox, and then, like Joe said, killed back in January.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.560
On January 15th, they announced they were ending the program, and now they're relaunching

08:15.560 --> 08:16.560
it.

08:16.560 --> 08:22.120
They even write on their site, like a cat, the test pilot program has many lives.

08:22.120 --> 08:27.560
And starting now with VPN, the Firefox Private Network, which is an extension that will provide

08:27.560 --> 08:33.320
a secure, encrypted path to the web to protect your connection and your personal information

08:33.320 --> 08:36.480
anywhere and everywhere that you use the Firefox browser, end quote.

08:36.480 --> 08:40.640
Well, I'd be keen to give this a go for sure, but unfortunately, right now at least, it's

08:40.640 --> 08:42.960
only available to Firefox users in the US.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.960
Oh, don't worry, Joe, they want your money, too.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.440
This is just the very beginning.

08:47.440 --> 08:52.040
We don't have any information on what the eventual pricing will be or what other things

08:52.040 --> 08:54.420
that they'll bundle in this whole little thing.

08:54.420 --> 08:58.340
So I'm sure eventually, they'll get to you because they need everyone's money, Joe.

08:58.340 --> 08:59.340
They all do.

08:59.340 --> 09:03.240
And I think, rumor has it, Mr. Westpain is giving this a go right now, so we may hear

09:03.240 --> 09:05.200
from him how it's gone.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.640
I think this is pretty smart.

09:07.640 --> 09:08.960
Build this right in.

09:08.960 --> 09:15.460
This is something that Mozilla can do much more flexibly than Google can do.

09:15.460 --> 09:19.540
It's something that Apple has zero interest in, so they're the major browser provider

09:19.540 --> 09:22.080
that's best positioned to try something like this.

09:22.080 --> 09:27.960
I also, time will tell, but right now, I trust the Mozilla brand, so if I was trying to pick

09:27.960 --> 09:32.140
between VPN providers and I just wanted something to make sure that when I'm checking my bank

09:32.140 --> 09:36.760
account at the coffee shop is secure, I would trust something built into Firefox, something

09:36.760 --> 09:38.600
with Mozilla's name on it.

09:38.600 --> 09:43.360
So I think it's pretty smart for them to try it, and don't worry, they'll get to everybody

09:43.360 --> 09:44.360
soon.

09:44.360 --> 09:49.760
He's using Cloudflare, though, and I've seen a bit of a negative reaction to that.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.600
I don't think anybody likes centralization.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.720
It's notable, too, this week that Cloudflare had their IPO.

09:55.720 --> 10:00.920
They rose 20% in the first day of trading on the public market, and I think on their

10:00.920 --> 10:03.280
first day, ended at $18 a share.

10:03.280 --> 10:08.560
So Cloudflare has a lot going on right now, including being closely connected with another

10:08.560 --> 10:13.960
feature that Mozilla is rolling out to Firefox users in the US.

10:13.960 --> 10:20.160
This month, DNS over HTTPS will begin turning on for some.

10:20.160 --> 10:24.600
And once again, Mozilla have come in for a bit of criticism for partnering with Cloudflare,

10:24.600 --> 10:30.560
because although with the DNS over HTTPS thing, you can change the provider, the default is

10:30.560 --> 10:31.900
going to be Cloudflare.

10:31.900 --> 10:36.480
When I dug around on this, Mozilla's response appears to be, Cloudflare is the only provider

10:36.480 --> 10:39.200
that would agree to our privacy terms.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.520
That's a hard answer to argue with.

10:41.520 --> 10:45.000
I guess we have only Mozilla to trust in this.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.600
Much like the VPN functionality, we're really putting our faith in Mozilla to do their due

10:49.600 --> 10:51.520
diligence with Cloudflare.

10:51.520 --> 10:55.560
For those of you that aren't familiar, and I probably do this for a little bit longer,

10:55.560 --> 11:04.060
DOE, or DNS over HTTPS, allows DNS requests to look like normal HTTPS traffic to special

11:04.060 --> 11:08.040
DOE compatible DNS servers that are called DOE resolvers.

11:08.040 --> 11:14.920
Basically it hides DNS requests inside a normal deluge of HTTPS traffic over a network.

11:14.920 --> 11:20.600
And that has the advantage of bypassing censorship, monitoring, keeping the requests secure, but

11:20.600 --> 11:26.200
it also forfeits some of the advantages of DNS, like network-wide resolving and decentralization

11:26.200 --> 11:27.640
of the protocol.

11:27.640 --> 11:33.140
One thing I like to remind people in this whole DNS over HTTPS conversation, you have

11:33.140 --> 11:35.960
implementation and you have technology.

11:35.960 --> 11:41.400
The implementation can be done wrong and you can have centralization and you can have monitoring

11:41.400 --> 11:45.160
and you can have all kinds of awful things happen.

11:45.160 --> 11:48.640
That doesn't mean the technology is necessarily flawed.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.120
There's two separate issues here.

11:50.120 --> 11:53.520
Yeah, Mozilla is actively working on the implementation of this.

11:53.520 --> 11:57.640
They're making sure that it doesn't break parental controls, for example, and they're

11:57.640 --> 11:59.560
taking on board some of the criticism.

11:59.560 --> 12:01.320
Yeah, we'll see where this goes.

12:01.320 --> 12:06.560
The old sysadmin in me is a little bothered by just ignoring the system DNS settings,

12:06.560 --> 12:11.760
because often those are set specifically on an enterprise network in a very particular

12:11.760 --> 12:12.760
way.

12:12.760 --> 12:17.600
However, like you said, Mozilla is testing this and I'm not the only one that's concerned.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.640
Others are concerned as well.

12:18.640 --> 12:22.240
So we'll see this work itself out in the quote unquote marketplace.

12:22.240 --> 12:28.680
But like an example, OpenBSD is going to ship their redistribution of Firefox with DOE turned

12:28.680 --> 12:34.880
off because their view as a project is that all applications should respect the system

12:34.880 --> 12:35.880
DNS settings.

12:35.880 --> 12:36.880
Well, yeah.

12:36.880 --> 12:41.320
And just because it's default doesn't mean that you as the administrator can't turn it

12:41.320 --> 12:42.320
off.

12:42.320 --> 12:46.360
And if you're controlling the machines in a whole enterprise and you are controlling

12:46.360 --> 12:49.960
the DNS, then there's no reason why you can't just turn it off.

12:49.960 --> 12:54.440
I also kind of feel like the genie's out of the bottle on this one.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.920
Apps on phones are going to start implementing this.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.360
And even Google is working on it with Chrome in version 78.

13:01.360 --> 13:07.360
For a small group of users running Chrome 78, Google will run an experiment.

13:07.360 --> 13:12.400
The checks of their DNS provider is part of a small list of known DOE compatible providers.

13:12.400 --> 13:18.480
If your DNS provider is on that list, Chrome will automatically upgrade to DOE just in

13:18.480 --> 13:19.540
the background.

13:19.540 --> 13:24.120
So if you're using Google DNS or Cloudflare or OpenDNS, which are a couple of popular

13:24.120 --> 13:28.760
ones, it may detect this and just start trying it and see how it works.

13:28.760 --> 13:32.640
Yeah, it does feel like this is going to end up being default in all the browsers before

13:32.640 --> 13:33.640
too long.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.460
I also think messaging applications will be quick to adopt this.

13:36.460 --> 13:38.000
Just picture something like Telegram.

13:38.000 --> 13:42.360
If they have censorship issues at the state level, using something like DOE might help

13:42.360 --> 13:45.460
bypass that censorship.

13:45.460 --> 13:48.360
It could give people a voice in some cases.

13:48.360 --> 13:54.640
There's a lot of pro-humanity arguments that can be made, as well as, oh my god, think

13:54.640 --> 13:59.040
of the children arguments that can be made saying, well, you'll bypass parental filters.

13:59.040 --> 14:01.920
You'll bypass social media filtering.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.920
So this is going to be a fascinating one.

14:03.920 --> 14:07.560
Well, in the short term, you wouldn't think that the next release of CentOS was going

14:07.560 --> 14:09.740
to be hotly anticipated.

14:09.740 --> 14:15.120
But even apparently the CentOS community gets pretty excited about the next big release.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.320
And unfortunately, they're going to have to wait a little bit.

14:18.320 --> 14:23.100
So Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 came out on May 7, 2019.

14:23.100 --> 14:28.840
The moment that happens, everyone asked the question, when CentOS 8 shipping?

14:28.840 --> 14:34.240
And as happened, CentOS users started complaining on the development mailing list, which kind

14:34.240 --> 14:36.600
of felt like old times.

14:36.600 --> 14:40.680
Back in the good old days when CentOS was like way behind a RHEL release, and there's

14:40.680 --> 14:45.520
all kinds of responses in the thread, the traditional like people that get very upset

14:45.520 --> 14:48.280
and then people that are very thankful for all the hard work.

14:48.280 --> 14:51.400
There's some name calling in there, lots of back and forth.

14:51.400 --> 14:57.320
But you eventually get to the nugget that the team just has limited time, limited resources.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.920
Which is a shame, given that Red Hat bought them, you think they would have given them

15:00.920 --> 15:02.920
a few more people to work on it.

15:02.920 --> 15:07.680
Is it a shame or is it a sign that they've taken sort of a hands off approach and they

15:07.680 --> 15:11.160
let the project continue on its organic original path?

15:11.160 --> 15:12.720
I don't know.

15:12.720 --> 15:17.600
Maybe it's a good sign, but on the CentOS page on Wikipedia, there's a very handy table

15:17.600 --> 15:24.280
that shows you the CentOS releases next to the RHEL releases and the delay in the number

15:24.280 --> 15:25.280
of days.

15:25.280 --> 15:29.720
And looking at them, it's usually around about a month, maybe a little bit more than that,

15:29.720 --> 15:30.720
five or six weeks.

15:30.720 --> 15:36.560
But you get to 7.7 of RHEL, which came out on the 6th of August, and that hasn't come

15:36.560 --> 15:37.560
out yet.

15:37.560 --> 15:40.600
So production is kind of due any day now.

15:40.600 --> 15:46.400
And that is what's holding up CentOS 8 here, they need to get 7.7 out first.

15:46.400 --> 15:53.360
But that seems to be a totally fair and understandable priority because you have many more users

15:53.360 --> 15:56.560
that have CentOS 7.x in production.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.080
No one has 8 in production.

15:58.080 --> 16:02.120
So take care of the users that are running the production OS right now.

16:02.120 --> 16:08.240
And who uses something like CentOS and expects to have the latest and greatest the moment

16:08.240 --> 16:09.240
it comes out?

16:09.240 --> 16:12.800
Like that just seems completely opposite of what the expectations of the distro should

16:12.800 --> 16:13.800
be.

16:13.800 --> 16:16.920
It's supposed to be a slow-moving enterprise-grade distro.

16:16.920 --> 16:17.920
Well, exactly.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.080
Well, this isn't very enterprise, Joe.

16:20.080 --> 16:26.860
But in terms of anticipated releases, the Pine64 folks blew my mind this week when they

16:26.860 --> 16:34.240
tweeted a picture of the PineTime, a Linux-compatible smartphone companion.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.000
They say it's a side project of theirs.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.200
Yeah, I wasn't expecting this to be announced quite so soon.

16:39.200 --> 16:43.240
I did know about it through my connection to Pine64.

16:43.240 --> 16:46.800
But I wasn't expecting it to be so cheap as well.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.000
And the reason that it's cheap is that it is very low spec.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.860
We're not talking about an Android Wear-type device here that's going to run Linux.

16:55.860 --> 16:59.560
We're talking about something that's much more like the original Pebble, only instead

16:59.560 --> 17:03.080
of the e-ink screen, it's going to have a touchscreen LCD.

17:03.080 --> 17:07.640
But it's going to be running something like RTOS, something much, much lighter than Linux.

17:07.640 --> 17:11.600
And so the feature set is going to be very much limited.

17:11.600 --> 17:15.080
Limited might be okay, depending on what that limited feature set is.

17:15.080 --> 17:17.200
Well, I'm really surprised by this.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.520
We know just a little bit right now.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.560
It seems that the watch will be made of a zinc alloy and plastic.

17:22.560 --> 17:26.980
It'll come with a charging dock, a wristband, and a heart rate monitor.

17:26.980 --> 17:31.000
And it said it could possibly last several days on a charge.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.440
Development kits should be available in one to two months.

17:34.440 --> 17:40.040
PineTime seems to be really similar to an existing fitness tracker that's sold on AliExpress.

17:40.040 --> 17:43.080
But it appears this might be slightly nicer.

17:43.080 --> 17:47.440
For example, this has a full touchscreen, whereas the AliExpress has just a one touch

17:47.440 --> 17:52.180
button, as well as this may have firmware that is fully freeable.

17:52.180 --> 17:54.240
We don't really know quite yet.

17:54.240 --> 17:58.960
But if it got some of the basic health tracking stuff right and reported them back to my OS

17:58.960 --> 18:02.260
in a way that was usable, that'd really be the big tick.

18:02.260 --> 18:05.940
If you can tell time and do the health tracking stuff, I'm pretty much in.

18:05.940 --> 18:10.300
I'd love to have a free, cheaper alternative to Fitbit that isn't tied to a cloud service

18:10.300 --> 18:11.660
of any kind.

18:11.660 --> 18:13.400
This would be an easy $25 for me.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.540
Well, I think we all need to not get carried away here.

18:16.540 --> 18:21.560
Because how Pine64 does things is they make the hardware, and then they rely on the community

18:21.560 --> 18:22.560
to make the software.

18:22.560 --> 18:27.060
That's always been the case for all of their single board computers and the pine books

18:27.060 --> 18:30.600
and the pine phone that's coming out.

18:30.600 --> 18:36.280
This tweet was really just trying to generate a bit of buzz and see if anyone was interested

18:36.280 --> 18:39.580
in collaborating with them to make this software.

18:39.580 --> 18:43.260
Because this is a very niche thing that we're talking about here.

18:43.260 --> 18:46.480
We're not even talking about mobile Linux, we're talking about, as I said, something

18:46.480 --> 18:48.680
like RTOS.

18:48.680 --> 18:51.160
There aren't that many devs of that.

18:51.160 --> 18:55.420
So this could not happen at all, potentially, if no one's interested in making the software

18:55.420 --> 18:56.420
for it.

18:56.420 --> 19:00.660
And even if they are, then you still need the companion apps to be written for the various

19:00.660 --> 19:01.660
platforms.

19:01.660 --> 19:05.820
And the idea of this is it's going to be a companion to things like Ubuntu Touch or post

19:05.820 --> 19:09.280
market OS with plasma mobile on it.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.860
It's not designed to be working with iOS and Android.

19:11.860 --> 19:15.540
I mean, there's no reason why anyone couldn't make those apps for iOS and Android.

19:15.540 --> 19:19.740
I think it'd be easy with Android to publish the app, because you could do it in something

19:19.740 --> 19:21.460
like F-Droid, for example.

19:21.460 --> 19:25.500
But I think that we need to not get too excited about this.

19:25.500 --> 19:28.780
It's not a finished product by any stretch of the imagination.

19:28.780 --> 19:30.500
Yeah, you're right.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.580
Fair points all around.

19:31.580 --> 19:35.860
I think on the iOS and Android side, it would really be a matter of either figuring out

19:35.860 --> 19:39.720
how to A, integrate with HealthKit, or B, just adding support to an existing health

19:39.720 --> 19:42.060
tracking app for this device.

19:42.060 --> 19:46.860
So it may be more feasible than it seems initially for that aspect of it.

19:46.860 --> 19:50.940
The reason why I think it's kind of clever, and it both makes me think that they're trying

19:50.940 --> 19:55.060
to bite off more than they can chew, which we'll see, that's yet to be determined.

19:55.060 --> 20:00.220
But it also makes me think this is the area where we should be pushing.

20:00.220 --> 20:02.180
Smartphones are done.

20:02.180 --> 20:05.560
When I look at the Pine 64 phone, I think to myself, the Pine phone is going to be great

20:05.560 --> 20:11.300
for individuals like yourself and I, who love to mess around with this kind of stuff, load

20:11.300 --> 20:14.700
different firmwares, build tools out of them.

20:14.700 --> 20:21.340
It's a real nice market to serve, but it's not going to compete with iPhones or LGs or

20:21.340 --> 20:22.340
Samsungs.

20:22.340 --> 20:23.700
It's never going to compete.

20:23.700 --> 20:24.700
That's done.

20:24.700 --> 20:27.260
The Pepsi and Coca-Cola of that world has been established.

20:27.260 --> 20:32.580
You need ecosystems, you need developers, you need tons of marketing, you need deals

20:32.580 --> 20:36.460
with carriers, et cetera, et cetera.

20:36.460 --> 20:40.440
But wearables still seems really nascent.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.700
You have the Apple Watch, and then you have everything else.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.900
But everything else is a bit of a mix.

20:45.900 --> 20:48.460
Fitbit seems to be doing pretty strong.

20:48.460 --> 20:52.860
Nothing's really grabbed hold of the Android wear market particularly strong.

20:52.860 --> 20:54.460
But Fitbit seems to be decent.

20:54.460 --> 21:00.340
There's a couple of competitors out there, but there's still room to dominate the wearables

21:00.340 --> 21:05.580
market to offer something that's just a damn watch, but also contract your heart rate and

21:05.580 --> 21:09.880
your steps and help you lose a few pounds.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.580
That's the value of the Apple Watch.

21:11.580 --> 21:15.300
That's why even when I'm carrying my Pixel 3, I still have my Apple Watch on my wrist.

21:15.300 --> 21:18.500
Well, I don't think they're aiming for mass market adoption with this.

21:18.500 --> 21:25.140
Having spoken to Lucas from Pine64 about it, it's pretty much ready to go, just needs the

21:25.140 --> 21:26.140
software for it.

21:26.140 --> 21:30.300
The factory is ready to spin up and make them, but they just need the software.

21:30.300 --> 21:34.140
That software is going to take a long time to come.

21:34.140 --> 21:39.460
We're talking about next year, definitely, before this is a reality.

21:39.460 --> 21:44.380
Could you imagine a watch where the community could create different apps for health?

21:44.380 --> 21:49.100
I follow the sleep apnea community and their adventures in hacking their CPAP machines.

21:49.100 --> 21:53.540
I wonder, could somebody make a sleep app for a watch designed specifically for those

21:53.540 --> 21:55.180
of us that have sleep apnea?

21:55.180 --> 21:56.380
There's all kinds of possibilities.

21:56.380 --> 22:00.580
If we could just open the doors a little bit, it doesn't need to sell tens of millions.

22:00.580 --> 22:05.980
And also, Joe, what a statement does it make about how approachable this level of hardware

22:05.980 --> 22:06.980
is getting?

22:06.980 --> 22:09.900
It's going to be some performance monster.

22:09.900 --> 22:15.060
But a watch that can run an operating system with wireless chips in it and heart tracking

22:15.060 --> 22:19.980
that can be sold for less than hundreds of dollars, it's just kind of a remarkable statement

22:19.980 --> 22:21.980
about where hardware is at right now.

22:21.980 --> 22:23.340
It is, yeah.

22:23.340 --> 22:30.140
All I want is notifications on my wrist and security, something that's going to get patches

22:30.140 --> 22:35.660
and when the next Blue Born or whatever it is comes along, it gets patched against that.

22:35.660 --> 22:39.300
Man, notifications on the wrist are the worst.

22:39.300 --> 22:41.140
That's the worst thing.

22:41.140 --> 22:42.500
That's what I hate the most about my watch.

22:42.500 --> 22:48.580
I actually spend a fair amount of effort making sure that only a certain kind of notifications

22:48.580 --> 22:52.500
get through my watch because it's a different level of intimacy.

22:52.500 --> 22:57.060
They are vibrating something on your body that's attached to your arm.

22:57.060 --> 23:02.660
And so when somebody's sending you a stream of consciousness that's 15 messages long,

23:02.660 --> 23:05.420
that's 15 times that your arm will buzz.

23:05.420 --> 23:06.980
It just drives me nuts.

23:06.980 --> 23:10.620
So I really, that's the one thing I hate about these watches is the notifications.

23:10.620 --> 23:16.100
Sorry, I better stop doing that then, sending you my streams of consciousness.

23:16.100 --> 23:17.100
Actually you're pretty good at it.

23:17.100 --> 23:20.180
I was just thinking this earlier today, I'm not kidding, I was thinking before the show

23:20.180 --> 23:23.760
you and I were having a chat and you put everything in one message and I was actually doing it

23:23.760 --> 23:24.760
to you.

23:24.760 --> 23:29.180
In fact, I even did a correction as a separate message instead of doing an edit, which I

23:29.180 --> 23:30.180
apologize.

23:30.180 --> 23:31.820
Yeah, I try and edit the message.

23:31.820 --> 23:35.700
If someone hasn't read it, then I'll try and edit in all the extra stuff as I think about

23:35.700 --> 23:38.220
it, rather than sending a bunch of extra messages.

23:38.220 --> 23:41.020
It's kind of a polite thing to do, I think.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.020
It's the decent thing to do.

23:42.020 --> 23:45.900
I try to do it too, but I was on a roll, Joe.

23:45.900 --> 23:48.940
Well speaking of rolling, this show rolls right on.

24:19.300 --> 24:22.420
And being under three minutes means that it is just the headlines and the need to know

24:22.420 --> 24:23.420
details.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.420
Our first week is out.

24:24.420 --> 24:29.860
We're just getting started, and it also makes for a great flash briefing on the Echo.

24:29.860 --> 24:31.220
Very proud of the team for launching that.

24:31.220 --> 24:32.220
Go check it out.

24:32.220 --> 24:35.820
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

24:35.820 --> 24:37.940
I am at Chris LAS.

24:37.940 --> 24:39.300
And I'm at Joe Rissington.

24:39.300 --> 24:42.100
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week.

24:42.100 --> 25:00.420
Until then, have a great day, and we'll see you later.
