1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 146, recorded on February 23rd, 2020. I'm

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,680
Chris.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,680
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,680
Hello, Joe. Good to be connected with you. And I got to say, I just barely made it. I

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,600
was so busy installing the new Linux Defender from Microsoft.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,480
Yeah, they've announced a public preview of Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,320
Antivirus for Linux. What?

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,800
Finally, finally, now I can finally browse the web on my Linux box. I've been waiting.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,800
Okay, I might be joking a little bit. I actually have not installed this because it's not for

10
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,000
me. It's not for you, Joe. It's for the enterprise. They write, we are aiming to protect the modern

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,240
workplace environment across everything that is being Microsoft or non-Microsoft. We are

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:55,280
protecting endpoints across Mac. And today, we're extending this endpoint to protect Linux

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,440
and iOS and Android.

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,520
So the idea is they are selling the concept of end-to-end device protection, regardless

15
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,960
of its OS, all feeding sensor data, shared sensor data, back to this Microsoft protection

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,160
system, which is going to be part of Microsoft Threat Protection Suite, MTP, which is a bundle

17
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,160
of services.

18
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,400
Now, I know this is a lot, but how Microsoft is talking about this is like next level.

19
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,080
What makes Norton Antivirus look like your grandparents' antivirus? They write on the

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,840
Microsoft blog, this is artificially intelligence-powered sensors all over the place, designed to stop

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,320
attacks from spreading and auto-healing impacted assets. And they write one more that I just

22
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:47,640
loved, coordinated defense to uncover the full attack kill chain can help block nation-state

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,240
level attacks. So this is nation-state antivirus level here. That's pretty good, Joe.

24
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,080
Yeah and it all ties into Azure as well, obviously. The way Microsoft are talking about this,

25
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:06,800
they want to just control the whole antivirus security sector in enterprise. And they want

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:13,680
ATP to be that box that you check on your compliance form. And I think that it's genius.

27
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,320
I think that this really goes to show what a good CEO Satya Nadella is. This is a strategy

28
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,380
to stay relevant in the enterprise over the next 10 or 15 years, while Windows on the

29
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:32,640
desktop becomes less relevant and Windows Server becomes less relevant. And as the market

30
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,320
changes, they're going to still be in the enterprise. Their salespeople will use that

31
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,560
Microsoft name and they will stay relevant and stay making a ton of money.

32
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:49,080
As we talk about this, I am of two clear minds, which are very much in conflict with each

33
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,240
other. There's the version of me that wants to sit here and just yell how this is totally

34
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,160
unnecessary. It's going to be a major impact on your performance. It's likely invasive

35
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,800
in some way because of the amount of information it needs to collect to do this job properly.

36
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,120
But then there's the enterprise, Chris, that knows that this means more people can now

37
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,560
run Linux on their desktops because they can be compliant with corporate requirements.

38
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,520
And as you just alluded to, often audit policies that they're held to, which is a really big

39
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,540
deal to make a breaker. So it means no Linux for some companies. This change could now

40
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,000
mean employees have an option they didn't have before. On that hand, I'm like, wow,

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,240
that's great. And I can also see Microsoft's pitch here. If we have sensors on all of the

42
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:40,840
endpoints, iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and on your servers and on your cloud servers,

43
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,040
then we're collecting all of that. We're using our training to analyze it and identify threats

44
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,560
and then automatically shutting down services or blocking access proactively while alerting

45
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,420
you. And only Microsoft can do it because only Microsoft has it across this entire range

46
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,360
of devices and services.

47
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,100
If I feel like software like that or a service like that is essential to my business, that's

48
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,980
a pretty compelling argument. I would be drawn to that. Now there's that other side of me

49
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,640
that's like screaming right now at how I would never want anything like this. But that's

50
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,680
often the case for things that are designed for the enterprise.

51
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,680
Well, yeah, I don't want anything to do with this, but I can see it being massively successful.

52
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,000
This bundling of security products that Microsoft has will be rolled out in various different

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,260
ways to existing subscribers to some of the Office 365 products, as well as others. But

54
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,520
speaking of services, we have an update on one of Mozilla's much talked about services.

55
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,640
Yeah, their VPN service, which is still invitation only and costs $4.99 per month, now has an

56
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,240
Android app.

57
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,160
As a reminder to everyone out there, the Firefox private network VPN is powered by Mulvad VPN.

58
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,800
And they make claims on their website, which I just went through again this morning, that

59
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,840
they do not log and monitor user data. And here's something else that's kind of interesting.

60
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,800
They're using WireGuard for the back end connectivity. So this may end up being one of the largest

61
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,480
commercial deployments of WireGuard to date. Now, be aware at this point, they do not have

62
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,400
as many WireGuard servers as they do open VPN servers. As of this recording, they have

63
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,640
169 WireGuard servers distributed throughout the world. So it's still a pretty good amount.

64
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,640
But the Android app for the Firefox private network is using WireGuard to connect back

65
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,660
to Mulvad. And they're wrapping it up in a pretty nice to use package that supports the

66
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:34,380
Mozilla Corporation. $4.99 per month isn't bad, because when I looked into Mulvad, they

67
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,720
seem like they check out like obviously, I don't have access to their logs and stuff.

68
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,260
So I can't make full claims. But a lot of what they use, they have contributed back

69
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,540
upstream and their own code that they've written, they've open sourced and posted on their GitHub.

70
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,460
And I went through a lot of it and it looks really good. They seem at least solid to me

71
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,540
like Mozilla has made a good choice as outwardly as you can judge these kinds of things.

72
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,360
And $4.99 doesn't seem outrageous, does it? That seems to be about the going rate for

73
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,000
a VPN service, at least a decent one.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,140
Sure that and WireGuard may actually be a little more performant than OpenVPN. So you

75
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:14,380
may be able to argue this is one of the faster VPN services for Android. I wouldn't mind

76
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:20,500
if the industry as a whole, tap the old brakes on the whole VPN thing, because it's a product

77
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,900
that's sold in various different ways, often using scare tactics, sometimes proclaiming

78
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,180
ways to pirate content and bypass region restrictions, which all of that feels a little gray area

79
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:36,500
to me. But additionally, it's advocating for consolidating user traffic, which ultimately

80
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,020
makes it more vulnerable to attack than having it distributed all over the place from people's

81
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,820
local networks.

82
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,580
So I kind of just I want us to think really carefully and be sure that when people are

83
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,340
choosing VPN providers, they're really looking into them because there's a lot of flashy

84
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:56,900
ones out there that make it really easy to one click VPN. Now, maybe that's a good thing

85
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,200
for average users, but maybe we're running a risk of consolidating traffic and actually

86
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:06,180
making people more vulnerable in the long term. What do I know? We'll have to just wait

87
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,620
and see at least this one here seems legit. And it seems like they have a really easy

88
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,020
to use implementation. Those two combinations hopefully will be a success for them.

89
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:20,660
Did you see that video that Tom Scott made about VPNs about a month ago, maybe talking

90
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:27,420
about some of the claims that they make and how HTTPS really does solve a lot of the problems

91
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,780
that they claim they're solving with VPNs?

92
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,500
No, no, I'll have to look that up.

93
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,860
Yeah, it's a good video. I didn't learn a huge amount. But I think that he put it in

94
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,300
very simple terms that non techie people can understand. So it's worth a watch.

95
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,740
While we're still talking about VPNs, we should mention that private internet access is planning

96
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,580
to open source their Android app.

97
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,420
Yeah, the process has started. And they've also some of the dependencies and it's going

98
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,380
to be happening shortly, according to their blog. And it's part of an overall strategy

99
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,300
to open source everything we possibly can, which I think in this day and age of like

100
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,220
you say, some of the VPN providers seeming a bit shady. I think it's good PR for them

101
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,860
to have it all be open source.

102
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,080
Yeah, absolutely. And I suspect that's why IVPN got in on it as well. They're open sourcing

103
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,000
their applications for Android, Mac OS, iOS and Windows under the GPL three. And it does

104
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,340
give me more confidence. Now, I don't still fully have a view into how they handle logs.

105
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,660
And I'd be curious to see who's going to step forward on that. I don't even know how you

106
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,180
would do that, how you could be publicly responsible and publicly prove that you're not logging

107
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,740
out. Maybe somebody clever will think of it.

108
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,180
Well, private internet access talk about having random audits. So that's one solution, at

109
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,180
least for now.

110
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,020
Yeah, I can see that. And I suppose it's just a matter of how you communicate the results

111
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,420
and follow up if there's something found, I guess. Well, let's talk about turning it

112
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,780
up to 11. Joe, get ready for that joke to be made for about a year.

113
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:58,060
Yeah, this is the first developer preview of Android 11. And this is unusual for them

114
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:02,820
in that they're calling it Android 11. It used to be the letter of the dessert. But

115
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:07,300
since they've dropped that, I suppose they're not doing that anymore. So it's just Android

116
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,460
11 developer preview.

117
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:15,900
I think I like it now. I think I think I prefer this. It's just simpler and a little a little

118
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:22,200
more serious, I guess. Android 11 has a whole bunch of changes, as you would expect. There's

119
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,580
probably the most noticeable change in the notification area where they're going to have

120
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,520
a dedicated conversations section in the UI. So there'll be a top level of your notification

121
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:38,540
shade where you'll find ongoing conversations with quick ways to reply. Additionally, you're

122
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,220
gonna love this, Joe. They're making an OS wide API for message and chat bubbles. So

123
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,900
you can have chat bubbles all over your OS. I'm sure you'll love that.

124
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,980
It doesn't make sense on a small phone screen. But I suppose on some of the big foldables

125
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,340
that they're also now supporting. That kind of makes sense, maybe.

126
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:59,060
Yeah, yeah. And it felt like a tablet to back in the day when I had Android on a tablet

127
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,020
and a Samsung, it kind of worked. But I don't know, on a small, I want my phone smaller.

128
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:08,180
So I'm just those kinds of things. I'm not super stoked about I am really happy to see

129
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:12,540
improvements and notifications. And I'm happy to see the one time permission dialog box

130
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,140
come to Android. So if you've used iOS before, you know this one, you launch an app. For

131
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,900
the first time, it says, Hey, this app wants access to your location. Do you want to only

132
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,420
allow it this time? Do you want to allow it only when you're using the app or just totally

133
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,060
deny it? That's going to now be the modal dialog that comes up in Android 11. When you

134
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,680
launch an application, similar things for not just location, but also your microphone

135
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,380
and your camera. And with those, which is kind of a neat trick, you can now grant temporary

136
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,940
one time access, which didn't exist before in Android, which has existed in iOS. And

137
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,020
it's something that I think is the just right amount. I'm trying out an app one time. I

138
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:54,540
have no idea if this thing's bogus or not. Only allow it this once, and then proceed.

139
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,140
I think that's a great option. And it's nice to see that evolve over the last couple of

140
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,140
Android releases.

141
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,700
Yeah, that's the standout feature to me. I think it's needed that for quite some time.

142
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,820
And it may not be original, but who cares? It's a great feature.

143
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,940
I thought you were going to say scheduled dark theme.

144
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,500
That's pretty cool, but I just have a dark theme all the time anyway. So yeah, I don't

145
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
really want to schedule that.

146
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,940
No, I'm not surprised. I'm not surprised. Also some new UI stuff around setting options

147
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:25,020
for do not disturb and whatnot. It doesn't seem to me like it's a blow away release,

148
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:30,760
but it appears there's just enough security tweaks that they've had to provide some backwards

149
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,780
compatibility options for Android developers that aren't ready to totally modernize and

150
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,940
11 eyes their app that they can throw in their code to let Android 11 know that they haven't

151
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,940
gotten up to snuff yet and not abuse them as bad. I'll be curious to see if that works

152
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,900
out and I'll be curious to see if app developers even bother updating their apps with that

153
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:55,640
flag in there because a lot of times the new releases get neglected for so long that even

154
00:11:55,640 --> 00:12:00,300
something as simple as that often gets overlooked or adding support for a notch or whatever.

155
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:06,020
But maybe, maybe those things are finally starting to shift on the old Android.

156
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:10,420
Maybe one thing I'm not sure if this is in iOS, but something that's going to be really

157
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:16,740
useful for me is when you put the phone into airplane mode, it doesn't disconnect Bluetooth

158
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,620
by default, which used to sting me a lot when I would go into the tube, the underground

159
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:28,780
trains here in London where we have no service down there, no signal. And so you either just

160
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:34,300
leave it not on airplane mode and drain your battery or you have to pause your podcast,

161
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,220
put it in airplane mode, re-enable Bluetooth, hear the ding and then start playing again.

162
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,340
And now you won't have to do that on the tube or on airplanes.

163
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:48,900
Fascinating. Interesting. So yeah, iOS did roll that out about the time the Apple watch

164
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,940
came out because guess what? People were buying their Apple watches, turn it off their Bluetooth

165
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,060
and then all of a sudden their watch that was totally dependent on a phone was dumb.

166
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,540
And their AirPods will quit working. You know, these Apple users were not happy about it.

167
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,740
So what iOS does is when you get to the control panel and you toggle off Bluetooth there,

168
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:13,100
it disconnects most devices, but not certain devices like your watch, your headphones,

169
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,220
things like that. If you go into the settings app, you go into the actual settings and go

170
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,540
into the Bluetooth settings where you'd see all your pairings and stuff like that. And

171
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,700
if you turn it off there, it actually completely turns off Bluetooth.

172
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,660
All right. I don't know how I feel about it not killing all the radios though. It is a

173
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:35,060
convenient feature, but I like the fact that with airplane mode you just toggle it and

174
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,900
that's it. It's totally disconnected in theory at least.

175
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,980
Yeah. Well this, when Apple made this change, I think it was probably one of the bigger

176
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:48,340
upsets about that release of the OS. People were shocked by it and it was, it was a story.

177
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,680
So I wouldn't be surprised if it isn't a little, although Android 11 will probably roll out

178
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,620
so slow that I doubt it'll be, it probably won't hit as hard.

179
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,680
Yeah. I mean, I'm still stuck on Android 9 with my old lineage release. So I'll probably

180
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,140
get 10 around the time that 11 comes out. But they have now enabled screen recording

181
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,700
from the kind of pull down menu. There's been a screen recorder built into lineage for quite

182
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,700
some time, but it's not as easy as it will be on Android 11. So that's quite nice I think.

183
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:23,180
Like to see more screen caps hitting Twitter in a feed near you. That's what I see people

184
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,820
using their iOS device for though, like write notes or you won't believe what just happened

185
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,660
and they'll screen record them recording or something. And then they posted on Twitter

186
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,060
and it's always such a funny way to like get a longer message across. So you might start

187
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,980
seeing that. It's a nice feature though when you're just trying to explain to somebody

188
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,780
like go here, tap this and then select this item. You can just now flip that down, hit

189
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,560
record, you do the action really quick and then in two seconds you can send it off to

190
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,260
somebody over a message. Yeah, and it's just what the world needs, more vertical videos

191
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:57,260
out there. Well, despite the JavaScript package repository, MPMs best efforts, they have yet

192
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:03,540
to find a way to fully fund open source development. The ambitions were high and so far the deliveries

193
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,980
have been low. Yeah, this is starting to irk people now because originally MPM had promised

194
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,820
to launch an open source funding platform by the end of 2019. Well, here we are in late

195
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,760
February and all they've managed to do is add the fund command. Yeah, they talked big.

196
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:23,280
The plan was to really create a platform to fund all of these dependencies and make it

197
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,860
worth people's time at least to contribute to the MPM repository. In fact, MPM Inc's

198
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,620
co-founder and CTO back when they announced it said, quote, the problem we're solving

199
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:37,660
is open source projects need funding and there are very few ways people can do that and get

200
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:43,860
that information in front of people using their code. But like so many great ambitions,

201
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:51,160
things can shift and change. I think you have to mention in this conversation that MPM went

202
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:57,620
through a major change recently. Their CEO left and that's kind of a big shift. There

203
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:03,940
was a leadership shuffle in general and the register contacted individuals at MPM like

204
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:11,260
Darcy Clark who suggested that this is just a reaction of company initiatives being reevaluated,

205
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:16,700
roadmaps getting adjusted and priorities changing. They had one plan, then new leadership comes

206
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,240
in and now their plans have changed. And it's not that they're abandoning this, but they're

207
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,000
obviously taking a lot slower approach. And I think you can kind of see that Joe in a

208
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,260
phone call that the CTO and co-founder had with the register. He says, ecosystems that

209
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,780
are sustainable won't happen overnight. A platform is a collection of features people

210
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:40,380
use. We're continuing to work on this. I don't think anything has changed, but we're making

211
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,020
steady progress and engaging with the community. I can appreciate that some folks, the progress

212
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:51,140
might seem a little lackluster. And then he continues, funding open source projects is

213
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:56,980
still a very big problem and it's still a very unsolved problem. And I wonder if they

214
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,260
haven't had a leadership change and they didn't come in and think, you know, this is a big

215
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:04,580
problem and we're not going to solve it. It's not our core competency. Let's scale this

216
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:05,980
initiative back a little bit.

217
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,620
Yeah, that seems to be exactly what they've done here.

218
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,140
It's a really hard position for NPM that is dependent on a vibrant community that they

219
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,380
really have to be careful how they interact with that community because they don't want

220
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,120
to upset them and demotivate people from participating in creating code that makes their platform

221
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,900
more valuable. At the same time, while they're making commitments, their leadership is changing.

222
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,660
And so they go out and say one thing and then things change after that. And now they're

223
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,980
kind of held to what they committed to, but held to the expectations of the new leadership.

224
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,660
It's a really difficult spot for the staff that have to interact with that community.

225
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,380
I hope leadership is able to appreciate that for them.

226
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,220
Well, as an aside, this story made me think about the Linux Foundation and Harvard Labs

227
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,980
report that came out that is attempting to quantify some of the most popular in terms

228
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:59,020
of usage open source software and maybe identify better practices they could follow. It's a

229
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,140
doozy, Joe.

230
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:05,660
This had a focus on JavaScript and frameworks and that side of open source and the most

231
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:11,580
popular and most widely used pieces of open source software are things that you wouldn't

232
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,740
necessarily have heard of.

233
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,820
Yeah, it's all the little bits that make the bigger things run. This is actually the second

234
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:25,340
census they have done. Census one looked at system packages specifically for Debian to

235
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:30,740
get a sense of how popular packages there are, assuming that other distros base off

236
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,580
Debian, you kind of get a baseline. This second census that was run by a different group in

237
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:40,860
the Linux Foundation wanted to look more at language level packages. The report discusses

238
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,380
some of the challenges in that things are not named consistently, so it's hard to talk

239
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,180
about them. And they also talk about how, like you just said, Joe, a lot of these little

240
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:56,080
pieces of interdependency packages that people create don't really have the same level of

241
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:03,460
eyes or auditing or even maybe even quality that you'd want in a production system.

242
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:10,020
This isn't necessarily new news, but the report is attempting to actually quantify what that

243
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:14,500
is. Like, what are they? What are the top 10 at least? And then this is just a first

244
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,220
pass, the intention being to get a baseline to figure out what they can't quite get a

245
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,220
hold of what they can't figure out and then take another pass at this again later.

246
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:27,580
This all comes back to Heartbleed, the open SSL bug that was discovered in April of 2014.

247
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,980
So nearly six years ago at this point. And shortly after that, the core infrastructure

248
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:38,220
initiative was established. And the aim was to stop something like that happening again.

249
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:44,660
Well, nearly six years later, we're not any closer really, it seems to avoiding the next

250
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,860
Heartbleed.

251
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,240
This doesn't really get us there. The Linux Foundation writes on their site, the report

252
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,300
begins to give us an inventory of the most important shared software and potential vulnerabilities

253
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,900
and is the first step to understand more about these projects so we can create tools and

254
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,680
standards that result in trust and transparency in software. The argument the report makes

255
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,840
is that free software now contributes to 80 90% of what runs the world even when you

256
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,100
look at large commercial applications and services underneath them is a bunch of little

257
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,860
individual open source components and free software components. And so their thinking

258
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,100
here is they want to make this something that businesses can rely on. Like all of a sudden,

259
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,740
it's become a big deal. It's really important that went from hobby software that people

260
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,660
are scratching an itch to something that people are seriously using in business. And according

261
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,600
to the census that they conducted, most of the people that contribute full time to open

262
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:45,080
source are doing so under a large corporation like Intel, or Microsoft, or Red Hat, or others.

263
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:51,100
This seems to be them establishing processes around this and realizing that you can't just

264
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:56,420
kind of randomly look at software and decide what you're going to put your efforts into.

265
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,900
You need to have a process of looking at what's most widely used and, and divert your resources

266
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:07,660
appropriately, which is the kind of standard big business way to do things, which is kind

267
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,680
of where the Linux Foundation fits into this whole ecosystem.

268
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:17,160
Because of just that, I think this is particularly vulnerable to Foundation scope creep here.

269
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:21,460
They're advocating in this consensus that all open source developers get on a big old

270
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,760
Zoom call, I'm being facetious, they don't actually advocate that part, and come to a

271
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,760
kumbaya on all naming schemes. And this is critical, Joe. The Linux Foundation believes

272
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,860
that until one exists, quote, strategies for software security, transparency, and more

273
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:42,220
will have a limited effect, organizations will remain categorically unable to communicate

274
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:47,020
with each other, because of all the silly names that silly open source developers choose.

275
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,460
Well, they do have something of a point, don't they?

276
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,020
Yeah, but there's something of a point of having some fun. It's kind of like coming

277
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:58,140
into a group that says, Hey, guys, you know, this entire open source software ecosystem

278
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:02,300
that you've built over the last 20 years that now even by our own report says you run 80

279
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:07,660
to 90% of the world's software, you've been doing it wrong. I agree. Could it be better?

280
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,720
Could it be simpler? And I grant you here, we're not talking about distribution names.

281
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,300
We're talking about names of libraries, names of MPM packages here.

282
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,900
Well, what they're trying to do is solve a fundamental problem here. And I think we all

283
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:25,480
agree that that problem is there. Heartbleed shows you that. So there has to be some way

284
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,980
of solving it. If you've got a fundamental problem, then you maybe need a fundamental

285
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:34,900
rethink of how it all works. And open source software may be successful, but it has this

286
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,940
flaw in it that a lot of that older code just never gets looked at.

287
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,240
So this is where I say foundation creep is very possible. Because when you start talking

288
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,460
about things like how people name their software, you really start having to come up with a

289
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:53,460
pretty big solution to that problem. And that's where the creep potential really comes in.

290
00:22:53,460 --> 00:23:00,020
Yeah, I think that this is somewhat over ambitious, but I can't say that I have a better solution

291
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,020
for the problem.

292
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:06,220
You know, ultimately, I think the tone of the report, and then also ZDNet's take on

293
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:12,620
it, sort of has me upset. Because it seems like they're talking down to these developers

294
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,740
who have contributed their time and their energy and years of their life into building

295
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,100
software that Jeff Bezos and others can get super rich off. Here's a line from the ZDNet

296
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,420
article that really got me fired up. Quote, in short, open source developers must start

297
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:31,400
addressing the problems of legacy software. Maintaining code is never as much fun as developing

298
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:38,380
new code, but it's necessary work, says blogger who's never written a line of code. I think

299
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:44,200
it completely dismisses all of the hard work that so many open source developers do out

300
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,860
of a labor of love, not because they want to back port fixes and software, but because

301
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:54,660
their users need it. It is a huge part of what our distributions and upstream software

302
00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:00,280
projects spend a significant amount of resources on is maintaining old software that people

303
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,560
don't want to leave. It's where a disproportionate amount of energy goes towards instead of creating

304
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:10,580
new software, and it completely dismisses all of the effort that they do. Could it be

305
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:16,580
better? Yes, especially in some of these NPM repos and things that are distributed amongst

306
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,980
many, many applications that end up, oops, big vulnerability in there. Obviously, we

307
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,700
have the data that shows it could be better. But this kind of whole tone throughout the

308
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,160
report and throughout ZDNet's article, it treats open source developers like they're

309
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,740
kids playing with their toys, and it's time for them to grow up and get serious. Meanwhile,

310
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:39,420
at the same time saying they're responsible for contributing to all of this ecosystem

311
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,380
that's made so much money. It's like they're complimenting and telling them they've changed

312
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,060
the world at the same time telling them that they're not serious, and that they're not

313
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,420
adults. I really just don't like the tone of it. And I think that's my core problem

314
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:57,000
with the way the Linux Foundation is approaching all of this. I encourage anyone to go look

315
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,860
at the link we'll have in the show notes for the Linux Foundation's official announcement

316
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:05,160
about this. Go ahead and have a read of that. And tell me about how that's going to inspire

317
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:10,620
more people to get into free software and open source. It's a boilerplate piece of PR.

318
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,340
I see where you're coming from here. It does feel as if it's coming from people who don't

319
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:21,380
necessarily have that experience of actually writing open source software. And maybe a

320
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,720
better approach would be to put together a panel maybe of developers who have got a proven

321
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,020
track record within the industry. Maybe that would be a better approach to this.

322
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,580
I think that would be a good way to go. Because ultimately what we want out of this is code

323
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:40,620
to be developed for free software and open source that patches security vulnerabilities

324
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,740
and leaves people confident in the software. That's the ultimate goal.

325
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:49,700
Well, at the complete other end of the spectrum from the Linux Foundation is the GNU project.

326
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,380
And it appears to be business as usual for them.

327
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,300
Yeah, and that's in light of the social contract we'd mentioned a couple of episodes ago that

328
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:02,180
was submitted by the community, reviewed and modified, and then presented for contributors

329
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:08,660
to agree upon. And they decided, no, we're going to just do business as usual. Thanks

330
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,660
for the idea, though, guys. I don't know if you remember, Joe, but we went through that

331
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:18,060
contract here on the air and it stated the four freedoms. It stated their goal of creating

332
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:23,780
free software and said that anyone was allowed to participate. That was the near totality

333
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,780
of the social contract.

334
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:30,660
Yeah, and the deadline for either accepting or rejecting that was Monday the 24th. It's

335
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:35,920
nearly Monday the 24th when we're recording this. And it seems that instead of accepting

336
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:41,340
or rejecting it, they've just ignored it. Stormin is just saying, I'm the chief nuisance

337
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:47,340
and I decide what happens. And it's just a reiteration, just writing down what has been

338
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,020
the almost unspoken hierarchy before that he just calls all the shots.

339
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,940
Well, this surely is resolved now. We can just file that one away as everyone has made

340
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:03,940
their statements and I'm sure it won't come up again. Yeah, we'll see about that. Well,

341
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,180
we keep track of that and all the other stories in Linux and open source. So why not get every

342
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,900
single episode? Go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get those.

Well, if you want something just a little extra, check out extras.show slash 57. Brent

345
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,380
has brunch with Heather Ellsworth from Canonical and it was a fascinating chat.

346
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,580
Yeah, well worth a listen. We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest

347
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:35,020
Linux and open source news. I'm at Chris LAS. I'm at Joe Ressington. Thanks for joining

348
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:55,540
us and we'll see you next week. See you later.
