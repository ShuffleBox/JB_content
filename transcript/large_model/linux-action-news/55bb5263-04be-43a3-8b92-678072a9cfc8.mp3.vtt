00:00.000 --> 00:10.920
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 264, recorded on October 26, 2022, I'm Chris.

00:10.920 --> 00:11.920
And I'm Wes.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.600
Hello Wes, let's do the news.

00:14.600 --> 00:20.440
Canonical announced Ubuntu 22.10 this week, codenamed Kinetic Kudu.

00:20.440 --> 00:25.040
This interim release seems to have a particular focus on the Raspberry Pi.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.440
I don't mind that at all.

00:26.440 --> 00:31.720
Ubuntu 22.10 now supports the MicroPython goodness on various microcontrollers, including

00:31.720 --> 00:39.240
the Raspberry Pi Pico W. Also, the Ubuntu graphics stack has transitioned to KMS, meaning

00:39.240 --> 00:44.560
developers can run Pi-based graphical applications, say using something like Qt, without a desktop

00:44.560 --> 00:46.680
session, and without Pi-specific drivers.

00:46.680 --> 00:50.200
You can see that's great for a lot of hardware installations.

00:50.200 --> 00:54.240
This complements also expanded support in this release of Ubuntu for all kinds of displays

00:54.240 --> 01:00.480
like E Ink Hat series, the HyperPixel range, and even the Raspberry Pi official touchscreen.

01:00.480 --> 01:08.100
The GNOME desktop was updated to version 43, which includes GTK4 theming for improved performance.

01:08.100 --> 01:14.160
And Pipewire also becomes the default audio system with 22.10, along with WirePlumber

01:14.160 --> 01:21.020
as the session manager, making this now a common stack across modern Linux desktops.

01:21.020 --> 01:25.920
And finally, an area that Canonical was drawing special attention to is their new Steam Snap.

01:25.920 --> 01:30.920
They noted that it includes the latest Mesa, presumably with the ability to decode video,

01:30.920 --> 01:34.440
and gamers can now be confident that they'll always be up to date, regardless of their

01:34.440 --> 01:39.440
host OS, without needing to configure any of those gross PPAs that somebody came up

01:39.440 --> 01:40.440
with.

01:40.440 --> 01:44.240
And you know, maybe this isn't absolutely necessary on an interim release like this

01:44.240 --> 01:48.560
particular one, but you could see how this Snap is going to be very useful on future

01:48.560 --> 01:49.560
LTS releases.

01:49.560 --> 01:53.280
But you can hear more of our thoughts on the overall release in Linux Unplugged episode

01:53.280 --> 01:58.760
481.

01:58.760 --> 02:04.680
Git T, a lightweight, self-hostable GitHub alternative written in Go, hits six years

02:04.680 --> 02:06.880
old this week.

02:06.880 --> 02:11.920
And for their birthday, well, they've had a few announcements, the biggest of which

02:11.920 --> 02:15.760
is the formation of a company called Git T Limited.

02:15.760 --> 02:21.360
Okay, they say of course, quote unquote, that Git T will remain open source, and they say

02:21.360 --> 02:22.920
a community project.

02:22.920 --> 02:28.960
It seems the primary goal of forming the company is around engaging in commercial support contracts,

02:28.960 --> 02:34.360
instance hosting, managing trademarks, and offering part-time employment to some maintainers,

02:34.360 --> 02:39.380
perhaps expanding that to full-time employment in the future.

02:39.380 --> 02:45.160
One rather surprising aspect of this announcement though, is that it seems Git T is considering

02:45.160 --> 02:50.600
creating a decentralized autonomous organization, or a DAO.

02:50.600 --> 02:54.320
Now they say that's to preserve the community aspect of the project and contributors would

02:54.320 --> 03:00.240
receive benefits based on their participation, such as from code, documentation, translations,

03:00.240 --> 03:05.720
and perhaps even assisting individual community members with support questions.

03:05.720 --> 03:11.480
Not a structure we see commonly adopted in open source, but possibly could be done well,

03:11.480 --> 03:14.280
and of course could also be done very poorly.

03:14.280 --> 03:20.960
But it is something we'll be keeping an eye on.

03:20.960 --> 03:26.960
The Asahi Linux team shared some big updates on their path to getting Apple M-Series SOC

03:26.960 --> 03:29.600
support in the Linux kernel.

03:29.600 --> 03:34.800
The Apple M-Series CPU frequency driver is finally looking like it's in good shape,

03:34.800 --> 03:40.280
which will definitely help the system manage performance, thermals, and power efficiency.

03:40.280 --> 03:44.200
Yeah, that is really good because these laptops and some of these systems are famous for their

03:44.200 --> 03:48.600
good battery life, and this is going to help accomplish that under Linux too.

03:48.600 --> 03:53.480
It also seems that the GPU driver is getting a lot closer.

03:53.480 --> 03:56.840
Originally they were really banging on this thing under Mac OS and trying to pass all

03:56.840 --> 04:01.520
the compliance tests in theory under Mac OS and then move it over to Linux.

04:01.520 --> 04:06.620
Well that's been done now, and now it's passing 99% of the compliance tests under Linux, which

04:06.620 --> 04:14.800
means the driver is getting to a really good state.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.920
While it might be a little hard to hear for those of us who still remember the excitement

04:18.920 --> 04:26.040
of the 486 CPU, the discussion around maintaining support for that classic architecture in the

04:26.040 --> 04:30.600
Linux kernel came up again this week.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.080
After reviewing code that mostly just seemed to be a series of workarounds for various

04:34.080 --> 04:42.120
older CPUs, Linus mused, quote, we got rid of i386 support back in 2012, maybe it's time

04:42.120 --> 04:46.520
to get rid of i486 support in 2022?

04:46.520 --> 04:52.960
He later went on to say, quote, so I really don't think i486 class hardware is relevant

04:52.960 --> 04:53.960
anymore.

04:53.960 --> 05:00.040
Yes, I'm sure it exists, but from a kernel development standpoint, I don't think they

05:00.040 --> 05:01.800
are really relevant.

05:01.800 --> 05:08.860
At some point, people have them as museum pieces, they might as well run museum kernels.

05:08.860 --> 05:14.120
And perhaps what really matters, and was pointed out later in the thread, it seems no one really

05:14.120 --> 05:20.040
wants to stand up and offer to do the work to maintain that support.

05:20.040 --> 05:31.240
The i486 architecture debuted in 1989 and was succeeded by Intel's Pentium in 1993.

05:31.240 --> 05:35.840
Linode.com slash LAN, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.840
It's a great way to support the show too.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.480
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

05:40.480 --> 05:43.920
It's simple, affordable and accessible to whatever your skill level is.

05:43.920 --> 05:47.280
And they have the best support in the business because they're architected like nobody else

05:47.280 --> 05:48.640
in the business.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.360
Linode's how we run everything.

05:50.360 --> 05:54.040
Whatever we built in the last couple of years, we deploy it on Linode.

05:54.040 --> 05:58.600
My personal site, my family stuff, game servers, I run it personally on Linode too.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.840
They have a Linux culture that runs deep.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.840
They've got fantastic support.

06:02.840 --> 06:07.040
And they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers out there that want to lock into their crazy

06:07.040 --> 06:08.040
platforms.

06:08.040 --> 06:09.920
But I also think Linode truly has the best performance.

06:09.920 --> 06:14.160
And today they got 11 data centers around the world, with a dozen more coming online

06:14.160 --> 06:15.160
next year.

06:15.160 --> 06:19.000
And they have a bunch of great features besides just running your applications really well.

06:19.000 --> 06:24.280
S3 object storage, cloud firewalls, easy to understand backups, Kubernetes support and

06:24.280 --> 06:26.700
a dashboard for days.

06:26.700 --> 06:31.280
To go build something, go learn something, try it for yourself for real.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.400
$100 means you can really try it.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.000
Linode.com slash LAN.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.320
Go there to support the show and try it out.

06:38.320 --> 06:43.920
Linode.com slash LAN.

06:43.920 --> 06:47.320
Kalyde.com slash LAN and a big thank you to Kalyde.

06:47.320 --> 06:51.840
Kalyde is endpoint security that uses the most powerful untapped resource in IT, your

06:51.840 --> 06:52.840
end users.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.120
They do things differently.

06:54.120 --> 06:58.000
Instead of treating every device like Fort Knox that locks it down and makes it slow,

06:58.000 --> 07:00.920
they work with your users.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.720
Kalyde will automatically notify your team when their devices are insecure and give them

07:04.720 --> 07:07.740
step by step instructions on how to solve the problem.

07:07.740 --> 07:11.200
They reach out with a friendly Slack DM and educate them.

07:11.200 --> 07:15.120
And for IT admins, you get a brilliant dashboard that lets you monitor the security of your

07:15.120 --> 07:17.020
entire fleet.

07:17.020 --> 07:20.880
Maybe it's a Mac, maybe it's Windows, or maybe it's Linux.

07:20.880 --> 07:21.880
Kalyde supports it all.

07:21.880 --> 07:26.480
And just a couple of days ago, their official macOS Ventura support dropped.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.680
They're right on top of that kind of stuff.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.880
It's truly great because in a snapshot, you can see if they have a password manager, if

07:31.880 --> 07:36.760
they have their OS up to date, if they've been following the guidelines and the requirements

07:36.760 --> 07:37.800
of IT.

07:37.800 --> 07:43.840
And it's perfect for generating a report for yourself, for leadership, maybe an audit.

07:43.840 --> 07:44.840
That's Kalyde really.

07:44.840 --> 07:48.920
It's user-centered cross-platform endpoint security for teams that Slack.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.940
You can really meet your compliance goals by putting users first.

07:52.940 --> 07:56.160
You visit Kalyde.com slash LAN to find out how.

07:56.160 --> 07:58.400
When you go there and activate a free trial, they're going to hook you up with a goody

07:58.400 --> 08:01.280
bag too that includes a free t-shirt.

08:01.280 --> 08:10.240
So that's K-O-L-I-D-E.com slash LAN, Kalyde.com slash LAN.

08:10.240 --> 08:14.280
We end this week with a roundup of recent Red Hat news.

08:14.280 --> 08:17.800
Now, Linux in the clouds, that's nothing new.

08:17.800 --> 08:23.760
But an on-demand remote Red Hat Enterprise desktop is rather noteworthy.

08:23.760 --> 08:30.080
Red Hat announced the general availability of RHEL Workstation on AWS, joining Ubuntu

08:30.080 --> 08:36.080
and Windows, which both already offer remote virtual desktops on Amazon's cloud.

08:36.080 --> 08:40.400
The product is basically just a virtual Linux workstation that can be accessed using a thin

08:40.400 --> 08:43.640
client or just a web browser.

08:43.640 --> 08:48.520
It's a cheaper alternative for some specific types of workloads and includes dedicated

08:48.520 --> 08:53.760
GPU options and other G family accelerated instance types that are suitable for remote

08:53.760 --> 08:54.760
workstations.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.360
Yeah, that makes sense.

08:56.360 --> 09:01.480
And hopefully it gives Red Hat a solid business reason to invest more in desktop technologies.

09:01.480 --> 09:06.680
I note that customers with Red Hat's cloud access can use their existing subscription

09:06.680 --> 09:10.920
to RHEL Workstation to deploy on AWS with no additional license required.

09:10.920 --> 09:15.880
I mean, of course, you still got to pay for your machine time on AWS, but that's nice

09:15.880 --> 09:16.880
to see.

09:16.880 --> 09:21.920
And keeping things in a Red Hat theme here, Stratus 3.3.0 was released this week.

09:21.920 --> 09:27.000
They say it includes one significant enhancement and several more minor enhancements, as well

09:27.000 --> 09:31.000
as more than just a couple of stability and efficiency improvements.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.940
Just a reminder for some of you out there, Stratus is a storage tooling solution from

09:35.940 --> 09:42.540
Red Hat that leverages XFS and LVM to manage Linux storage devices and provides features

09:42.540 --> 09:46.080
similar to ZFS and ButterFS.

09:46.080 --> 09:53.600
And in 3.3.0, it's become easier to use additional space on devices and behind the scenes, Stratus

09:53.600 --> 09:59.840
is a bit more conservative now when allocating space for the Thinpool metadata device.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.560
That's also really nice to see.

10:01.560 --> 10:05.400
There is some good tech in Stratus and some really good work going into it.

10:05.400 --> 10:09.280
It's sort of a shame that it just doesn't seem to be the solution the industry wants

10:09.280 --> 10:10.280
right now.

10:10.280 --> 10:13.800
Thankfully, Fedora has ButterFS and that seems to be going great.

10:13.800 --> 10:19.040
However, this week, we did get an update that Fedora 37's release will probably slip

10:19.040 --> 10:20.040
again.

10:20.040 --> 10:23.940
Yeah, you know, this happens sometimes.

10:23.940 --> 10:29.200
As we record, the decision has not yet been finalized, but the team is trying to decide

10:29.200 --> 10:35.840
how to deal with an impending critical open SSL update that was only just recently announced.

10:35.840 --> 10:41.520
Understandable, and the patch won't ship until next Tuesday, November 1st.

10:41.520 --> 10:47.260
It's going to be version 3.0.7 and it includes a fix for potentially multiple issues, one

10:47.260 --> 10:50.360
of which has been marked as critical.

10:50.360 --> 10:54.840
So as we record, like Wes said, the team is debating the best move.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.600
You can follow Matthew Miller on Twitter directly.

10:57.600 --> 11:01.680
For the latest, he'll have that, I'm sure, or, you know, tune in here because we'll

11:01.680 --> 11:06.040
keep an eye on Fedora 37, that open SSL vulnerability, and everything else going on in the world

11:06.040 --> 11:08.660
of Linux and open source.

11:08.660 --> 11:14.640
So head over to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get every single episode.

11:14.640 --> 11:19.960
And linuxactionnews.com slash contact to take a guess at when you think Fedora 37 will actually

11:19.960 --> 11:20.960
ship.

11:20.960 --> 11:21.960
Did we miss a story?

11:21.960 --> 11:25.200
Boost in with a new podcast app and tell us which story you would have liked to have seen

11:25.200 --> 11:26.200
us cover.

11:26.200 --> 11:31.200
We'll be back next week with our take on the latest Linux and open source news.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.520
Thanks for joining us.

11:32.520 --> 11:57.080
And that's all the news for this week.
