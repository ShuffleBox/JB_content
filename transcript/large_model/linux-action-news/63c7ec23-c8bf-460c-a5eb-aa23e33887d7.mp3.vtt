Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.360 --> 00:20.560
This is episode 20, recorded on September 24th, 2017.

00:20.560 --> 00:21.560
I'm Joe.

00:21.560 --> 00:22.560
And I'm Wes.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.560
Hello, Wes.

00:23.560 --> 00:24.760
Thank you for joining me this week.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.680
The boss is away, driving to New York.

00:26.680 --> 00:27.680
He's almost there.

00:27.680 --> 00:29.240
I saw his Rover log.

00:29.240 --> 00:31.520
Yeah, sounds like a great trip.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.440
I'm a little bit jealous, that's for sure.

00:33.440 --> 00:34.440
Thank you for having me.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.080
It looks like we have an excellent show today.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.040
Yeah, well, let's get straight into it then.

00:38.040 --> 00:43.140
So the Librem 5 is a device that we've been talking about on this show for two weeks already,

00:43.140 --> 00:45.800
and now it's going to get a third outing.

00:45.800 --> 00:50.400
And this time it's because the Gnome Foundation have officially partnered with Purism.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.920
They've given it their official backing.

00:52.920 --> 00:58.640
So I don't know whether to think that this is just good publicity or what, but either

00:58.640 --> 01:02.800
way, it seems to have bumped up their crowdfunded total that little bit more.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.520
Hey, that's definitely what counts in the end.

01:05.520 --> 01:09.780
And from my perspective, I've definitely had a little bit of Purism skepticism in the past.

01:09.780 --> 01:15.440
So having more of the technologies they rely on, having the sort of official endorsement,

01:15.440 --> 01:18.380
that plus a lot of other changes that I've seen, some of the momentum they've been building

01:18.380 --> 01:23.260
recently, and I think their improved transparency of late, all of those have kind of come together

01:23.260 --> 01:27.080
and I'm feeling a lot better about them, you know, as a company and a project.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.080
Yeah.

01:28.080 --> 01:32.080
So the Gnome Foundation say they're committed to partnering with Purism to create Hackfest

01:32.080 --> 01:37.840
tools, emulators, and build awareness that surround moving Gnome and GTK onto the Librem

01:37.840 --> 01:38.840
5 phone.

01:38.840 --> 01:44.860
A little bit nebulous, not any kind of concrete promises there, but it's still good that they've

01:44.860 --> 01:49.540
got Gnome and KDE, and I spoke to Jonathan Riddle about it, and he said that it's almost

01:49.540 --> 01:53.680
like the early noughties KDE Gnome wars all over again.

01:53.680 --> 01:56.400
Hey, that's got to be good, you know, some competition.

01:56.400 --> 02:00.000
Maybe they'll both be able to compete here, we'll end up with two awesome stacks on a

02:00.000 --> 02:01.480
largely free phone.

02:01.480 --> 02:04.800
Yeah, I'm just wondering which way they're going to go in the end.

02:04.800 --> 02:08.880
That's actually if it meets its crowdfunding total, when it's still like a million dollars

02:08.880 --> 02:11.040
away from that, so let's not forget that.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.400
Ooh, yeah, that's a very good note.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.720
Here's hoping, but that is a lofty goal.

02:15.720 --> 02:21.080
Yeah, well, it's still a fair way off, and the trajectory looks good, but I don't want

02:21.080 --> 02:25.640
to get too excited yet, and I just, I'm not willing to take the risk, so good luck to

02:25.640 --> 02:27.320
him, and I keep saying that.

02:27.320 --> 02:30.280
I hope it happens, and then maybe I can buy one afterwards.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.280
Amen.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.520
So, speaking of phones, let's talk about Replicant.

02:33.520 --> 02:39.080
So Replicant is the totally free software version of Android, and they've had another

02:39.080 --> 02:40.640
release this week.

02:40.640 --> 02:41.640
6.0.

02:41.640 --> 02:45.920
Well, they did have a 6.0 out before, so this is just another 6.0 release that's got some

02:45.920 --> 02:52.320
security fixes, but most importantly, some new devices, when I say new devices, they're

02:52.320 --> 02:57.200
all pretty old devices, unfortunately, and that kind of reflects the situation that you

02:57.200 --> 03:02.400
have with Android, that the newer devices are just basically impossible to run totally

03:02.400 --> 03:03.400
free software on.

03:03.400 --> 03:07.360
Yeah, it's a little disappointing when you read, I mean, I'm glad that this exists.

03:07.360 --> 03:08.360
We sort of need that, right?

03:08.360 --> 03:12.440
It helps the ecosystem, I think, at least in some ways, even if only in theory, but

03:12.440 --> 03:16.160
reading through it, it's a little hard to get excited about when I don't have any of

03:16.160 --> 03:17.160
those devices.

03:17.160 --> 03:22.120
I'm not about to go get one, so I just, I'm not going to play with Replicant anytime soon,

03:22.120 --> 03:23.120
unfortunately.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.960
Yeah, the device that seems most attractive to me is the Galaxy S3, because that is still

03:26.960 --> 03:28.520
a reasonably good phone.

03:28.520 --> 03:32.200
Yeah, and especially if you're running some open-source software, you're not loading the

03:32.200 --> 03:36.040
latest giant proprietary app, you could still get some real use out of it.

03:36.040 --> 03:41.040
Yeah, so even with lineage and no Google apps, you could still get pretty decent performance

03:41.040 --> 03:42.040
out of that phone, I think.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.400
Oh, that's a great point.

03:43.400 --> 03:49.920
With just F-Droid, so this is, basically, that on steroids, if you want free software,

03:49.920 --> 03:52.880
they do their very best to make all the drivers free.

03:52.880 --> 03:56.000
So yeah, I thought it was worth giving them a shout out anyway, it would be great to see

03:56.000 --> 04:01.800
more development and more money go into this, because there's just so little free software

04:01.800 --> 04:04.720
when it comes to phones, we've just accepted that you're going to have all these blobs

04:04.720 --> 04:07.960
going on, even if you're running lineage, like I am, there's still going to be a load

04:07.960 --> 04:12.080
of proprietary software blobs running in the background.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.080
You just can't escape it.

04:13.080 --> 04:16.140
So yeah, it's nice to see a little bit more momentum here.

04:16.140 --> 04:17.840
Good luck to Replicant.

04:17.840 --> 04:25.440
And yet more mobile news, UbiPorts have released OTA2, and there's more devices there as well.

04:25.440 --> 04:29.800
So UbiPorts is, well, they're still calling it Ubuntu Touch, it's a bit confusing, they

04:29.800 --> 04:34.160
don't seem to have their branding quite sorted out yet, because as we know, Shuttleworth

04:34.160 --> 04:39.980
pulled the plug on Convergence and Ubuntu Touch and Unity 8 and all that kind of stuff.

04:39.980 --> 04:45.960
But the mobile stuff was forked, well, I suppose just carried on really by the UbiPorts team.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.720
Yeah, in the grand tradition of open source.

04:48.720 --> 04:49.720
Yeah.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.720
And I was a bit skeptical that they would have enough resources to do it.

04:52.720 --> 04:57.000
But here we are, they've released two proper releases now.

04:57.000 --> 05:01.840
And this one is pretty solid, I tried it out today on a Nexus 5, which is one of the officially

05:01.840 --> 05:03.400
supported devices.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.840
And it works quite well.

05:04.840 --> 05:09.080
I mean, it's basically Ubuntu Touch, it's a little bit more polished than it was when

05:09.080 --> 05:13.800
Ubuntu and well, Canonical killed it.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.040
But it's still not ready for mainstream use.

05:16.040 --> 05:20.760
But that's the thing that my whole attitude to it changed.

05:20.760 --> 05:24.200
I don't know if that was the same for you, when it stopped being this consumer product

05:24.200 --> 05:30.760
and started to be just a community project again, suddenly, my expectations for it were

05:30.760 --> 05:31.760
kind of lowered.

05:31.760 --> 05:35.560
And I just accepted that, hey, it's a good project.

05:35.560 --> 05:36.560
It's got potential.

05:36.560 --> 05:37.560
Right.

05:37.560 --> 05:41.840
And it has the potential where it needs to be to be successful kind of changes, right?

05:41.840 --> 05:46.040
Like, if it supports some phones, if people can get some use out of it, that's totally

05:46.040 --> 05:50.400
successful in the open source world, not as a like mainstream consumer product, though.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.960
So I think you're right, mine has to and I've tried it on a Nexus 5.

05:53.960 --> 05:56.440
Unfortunately, my Nexus 5 is really on its last leg.

05:56.440 --> 06:01.320
So I'm in another situation here where I don't have a phone that I can run this on today.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.560
But I would love to see it.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.800
I've enjoyed using Ubuntu Touch in the past.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.900
And certainly, I might not use it on my main mobile device.

06:07.900 --> 06:11.800
But for projects, for embedded devices, anything that I maybe have an old tablet laying around,

06:11.800 --> 06:14.240
I would love that to be able to run Ubuntu Touch.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.240
Yeah.

06:15.240 --> 06:20.040
And so they say with this release, we're officially supporting the Nexus 4 and Nexus 7 2013 Wi-Fi

06:20.040 --> 06:22.000
version.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.040
And users of this device will find that they can install Ubuntu Touch 15.04 using the UbiPorts

06:27.040 --> 06:30.560
installer, which I tried the app image of today.

06:30.560 --> 06:32.040
And that worked absolutely brilliantly.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.040
Oh, great.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.120
So yeah, I recommend that.

06:35.120 --> 06:40.680
They've got an AXE and a DMG if you're on a evil proprietary operating system.

06:40.680 --> 06:41.880
And they've got a dev as well.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.680
So there's plenty of ways to install it.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.880
And it just makes it so much easier than messing around with the command line.

06:46.880 --> 06:50.360
It's just you run this nice, simple GUI, and it gets it sorted out.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.920
No fastboot, no ADB, just boom, done.

06:52.920 --> 06:56.680
Yeah, well, all that stuff's embedded in that, I assume, because it needs to be.

06:56.680 --> 06:57.720
Right, it has to be.

06:57.720 --> 07:01.560
And that's one of those little things adds a lot of polish and makes it seem like a successful

07:01.560 --> 07:03.120
project with momentum.

07:03.120 --> 07:08.120
And hey, maybe you could even get your only a little technical friend to play with it.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.120
Yeah.

07:09.120 --> 07:15.040
And I was actually speaking to Marius Gripsgard, I think it is, in the Late Night Linux Telegram

07:15.040 --> 07:17.920
channel yesterday about this.

07:17.920 --> 07:26.240
And he basically admitted, if that's the word, that he is testing a 16.04 version with Halliam

07:26.240 --> 07:27.600
on a OnePlus 3.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.600
Wow.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.840
So that is coming.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.400
It's not anywhere near official at this point.

07:34.400 --> 07:37.160
It's very much internally developed and tested.

07:37.160 --> 07:41.560
But this latest release isn't based on Halliam, which, is it Halliam?

07:41.560 --> 07:42.920
I never know how to say that one.

07:42.920 --> 07:43.920
I don't know either.

07:43.920 --> 07:52.880
Yeah, which is a project that's kind of bringing together a lot of the Linux based mobile OSs.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.880
So that's still in the future.

07:54.880 --> 07:57.440
But it's on the horizon, which is good to see.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.360
Yes, I would love 16.04 on my phone.

08:00.360 --> 08:01.360
Oh, man.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.440
Yeah, it would be good.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.120
It's kind of strange that it's all based on 15.04, which is...

08:05.120 --> 08:06.460
Right, that's a weird base.

08:06.460 --> 08:09.000
It's not a standard LTS or anything like that.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.840
Yeah, yeah, strange.

08:10.840 --> 08:11.840
Not supported anymore.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.920
And just, you know, it must be a bit of a hack.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.680
So there we go.

08:15.680 --> 08:19.620
All right, well, let's move on and talk about PipeWire.

08:19.620 --> 08:26.760
So PipeWire is the latest creation from one of the co-creators of Gstreamer called VimTamans

08:26.760 --> 08:27.760
or WimTamans.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.640
I've butchered that, sorry.

08:29.640 --> 08:33.600
And it is basically the pulse audio for video.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.920
Is that fair to say?

08:34.920 --> 08:36.320
You know, it's something like that.

08:36.320 --> 08:39.540
What I found really interesting was it's not only going to be for video.

08:39.540 --> 08:43.220
This first release is for video, but there's plans to include audio as well.

08:43.220 --> 08:46.800
So it's pulse audio plus video.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.480
Yeah, which kind of makes sense, doesn't it?

08:49.480 --> 08:55.060
Because one of the major multimedia issues that you have with Linux is syncing of audio

08:55.060 --> 08:56.440
and video together.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.220
Yes, definitely.

08:58.220 --> 09:00.580
And I think that speaks well of the development here, too.

09:00.580 --> 09:04.420
It seems like they understand, you know, they're not just trying to develop the tool that scratches

09:04.420 --> 09:05.420
their itch.

09:05.420 --> 09:09.540
They look holistically at the problem space and they want to build, you know, the next

09:09.540 --> 09:12.460
foundation of audio visual tools on Linux.

09:12.460 --> 09:16.060
And that's definitely something we need, especially if we want more developers to be able to target

09:16.060 --> 09:17.060
the platform.

09:17.060 --> 09:24.460
Yeah, but the thing is that this is not just for audio visual stuff like video editing

09:24.460 --> 09:29.600
and streaming and OBS stuff like JB does all the time.

09:29.600 --> 09:33.620
It's also got wider implications, hasn't it, for remote desktops and stuff.

09:33.620 --> 09:34.620
Yes, definitely.

09:34.620 --> 09:38.900
It sounds like they've done some great work trying to put in some, you know, put in some

09:38.900 --> 09:43.060
new shims, some build some foundations for the Wayland era that we are fast approaching

09:43.060 --> 09:48.140
so that we have remote desktop capabilities, screenshot capabilities, but in a, you know,

09:48.140 --> 09:52.920
at a foundational level that doesn't have to be hack implemented in each window manager.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.740
The fact is we are moving to Wayland.

09:54.740 --> 09:56.300
There are no two ways about it.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.680
It's happening.

09:57.680 --> 10:03.580
And you can't expect to have things that are based on working with X that are going to

10:03.580 --> 10:04.660
work long term.

10:04.660 --> 10:06.180
So we need to rethink stuff.

10:06.180 --> 10:09.860
Now is the time as we're moving to Wayland to do this, I think.

10:09.860 --> 10:12.260
And calling it pulse audio, I don't know.

10:12.260 --> 10:17.980
People have had a lot of bad experiences because that was introduced too early into Fedora.

10:17.980 --> 10:20.620
And this is going to be in the next version of Fedora.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.340
So the question is, is it going to be ready?

10:23.340 --> 10:27.540
Is it going to be another pulse audio gate, as it were?

10:27.540 --> 10:30.220
Here's hoping that it's going to be more ready than Pulse was.

10:30.220 --> 10:31.220
Yeah.

10:31.220 --> 10:36.500
I think it seems like people have learned a little bit from that mistake and are trying

10:36.500 --> 10:37.500
to avoid it.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.980
This first release looks like it just has video and audio will be added later partially

10:40.980 --> 10:43.780
because they are worried about that problem.

10:43.780 --> 10:48.620
But it does, you know, we had Wim on Linux Unplugged 2.15.

10:48.620 --> 10:52.540
Based on that, I had a lot of trust for the development models that they're doing, that

10:52.540 --> 10:58.180
they really know the problem space well and that they're not trying to just rush in and

10:58.180 --> 11:00.460
be the next big hyped thing in the Linux platform.

11:00.460 --> 11:06.540
Yeah, do check out Linux Unplugged episode 2.15 and you can hear more from Wes.

11:06.540 --> 11:07.540
Exactly.

11:07.540 --> 11:10.900
And it looks like, you know, if you're an Arch user, or PipeWire has already packaged

11:10.900 --> 11:17.740
an Arch and a few other distributions, so you might be able to just try it at home yourself.

11:17.740 --> 11:18.740

want to script it.

11:47.940 --> 11:53.540
Loads of the JB infrastructure runs on DigitalOcean, and I've been using it for years personally.

11:53.540 --> 11:57.460
And now, as well as block storage, you can also use object storage with DigitalOcean

12:18.780 --> 12:23.820
$10 in credit to get you started.

12:23.820 --> 12:27.880
Well Joe, I know how much you love proprietary software running on your machine outside of

12:27.880 --> 12:29.300
your control.

12:29.300 --> 12:32.980
We've got some new developments over on the EFF's website.

12:32.980 --> 12:40.140
They've got a new open letter about the recent W3C decisions around encrypted media extensions.

12:40.140 --> 12:43.900
And for people who might not know, could you explain encrypted media extensions?

12:43.900 --> 12:51.580
Well, to massively oversimplify it, it's a standard in HTML which allows encrypted media,

12:51.580 --> 12:52.580
as it would suggest.

12:52.580 --> 12:54.100
DRM is what we're talking about here.

12:54.100 --> 12:59.180
So the likes of Netflix can stream stuff to you without you being able to dump it and

12:59.180 --> 13:01.180
save it.

13:01.180 --> 13:06.580
And this was proposed a few years ago to be added to the W3C standards.

13:06.580 --> 13:11.380
And to say there was a bit of a controversy here is a bit of an understatement.

13:11.380 --> 13:15.940
There's been an argument going on for years.

13:15.940 --> 13:20.780
And this week it was officially voted into the standards.

13:20.780 --> 13:25.900
Now at some point there was a suggestion of compromise whereby it would be brought in,

13:25.900 --> 13:31.980
but security researchers could still hack on it and try and find vulnerabilities and

13:31.980 --> 13:38.140
responsibly disclose them, but that was shot down and is not happening now.

13:38.140 --> 13:47.700
So there was a vote of 108 in favor and 57 against with quite a lot of people abstaining.

13:47.700 --> 13:51.980
And the thing is that the W3C is supposed to be about consensus.

13:51.980 --> 13:55.500
And that is not exactly a consensus, is it?

13:55.500 --> 13:58.180
That's democracy, but it's not a consensus.

13:58.180 --> 13:59.180
Decidedly not a consensus.

13:59.180 --> 14:03.020
And especially when we have, you know, this will have far-ranging implications and this

14:03.020 --> 14:08.820
is about the only real kind of somewhat governance we have for the Wild West of the World Wide

14:08.820 --> 14:09.820
Web.

14:09.820 --> 14:10.940
Yeah.

14:10.940 --> 14:19.020
And so the EFF, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, were members of the W3C for quite some time,

14:19.020 --> 14:21.300
but that's it.

14:21.300 --> 14:27.820
Cory Doctorow has said, we're leaving, I'm resigning, and you can just get on with it,

14:27.820 --> 14:32.780
which is really sad because the EFF are a really important organization.

14:32.780 --> 14:38.900
And for them to basically be forced into leaving over this is not good.

14:38.900 --> 14:44.060
I wonder if they had to, I suppose they kind of did, but I think that maybe there was a

14:44.060 --> 14:51.220
way to work through this and vocally, very publicly voice their concerns about it and

14:51.220 --> 14:56.420
their distaste about it, but still be within the organization because we need that voice

14:56.420 --> 14:57.860
of reason.

14:57.860 --> 14:59.780
So it's a real disappointment here.

14:59.780 --> 15:02.400
Yeah, it's like at one hand it makes a big fuss.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.780
We're obviously talking about it here because of that, but what do we lose in the future

15:05.780 --> 15:08.980
by their voice not being on the council?

15:08.980 --> 15:09.980
Yeah.

15:09.980 --> 15:15.780
So where do you stand on encrypted media extensions anyway, and DRM as an HTML standard?

15:15.780 --> 15:20.540
The idea is that we get away from these plugins and Flash and Silverlight and everything.

15:20.540 --> 15:25.560
And do you accept, are you pragmatic enough to realize that you're going to have DRM one

15:25.560 --> 15:26.820
way or another?

15:26.820 --> 15:30.940
I think at the end of the day I am, and I do want to be able to watch Netflix or other

15:30.940 --> 15:36.140
services or still be able to pitch Linux and open source operating systems to friends and

15:36.140 --> 15:40.700
family and they're going to want to do those things, even if I might not want to.

15:40.700 --> 15:45.460
I thought that the compromise that was ultimately rejected was fairly reasonable because we

15:45.460 --> 15:51.540
are going to have to interact with these proprietary blobs that are running, managing the DRM.

15:51.540 --> 15:55.580
The least thing that we can be allowed to do is still introspect, still poke at our

15:55.580 --> 15:58.140
system, still have the ownership and control.

15:58.140 --> 16:02.900
Otherwise, what was ultimately accepted here, it really does start to take away from this

16:02.900 --> 16:08.660
open web feeling and, yeah, sure, I downloaded Chrome, I'm running it on my laptop.

16:08.660 --> 16:09.660
It's different now.

16:09.660 --> 16:16.080
It's going to be farther away from Chromium and I feel less free to use and it's either

16:16.080 --> 16:18.060
my control or their control.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.460
I don't feel as in control.

16:19.460 --> 16:21.740
You're starting to sound like Stallman there.

16:21.740 --> 16:22.740
I know.

16:22.740 --> 16:27.820
And so that's, I definitely have those feelings at the end of the day, this is going to happen

16:27.820 --> 16:30.660
and I'm certainly going to use it.

16:30.660 --> 16:31.820
It's definitely sad though.

16:31.820 --> 16:38.020
Yeah, it's not ideal, but I think it was inevitable and we just have to deal with it, unfortunately.

16:38.020 --> 16:41.160
Find other ways that we can continue to be free on the web.

16:41.160 --> 16:42.160
Yeah.

16:42.160 --> 16:43.700
So let's talk about Facebook.

16:43.700 --> 16:44.700
What?

16:44.700 --> 16:46.540
Why are we talking about Facebook?

16:46.540 --> 16:49.900
Well, we're talking about ReactJS.

16:49.900 --> 16:54.260
So this is another controversy that has been brewing for a while.

16:54.260 --> 17:04.600
So React and Jest and Flow and Immutable, loads of the modern web developer type frameworks

17:04.600 --> 17:13.340
were licensed by Facebook as the BSD plus patents license, which basically meant that

17:13.340 --> 17:19.820
if you use the software, you can't sue Facebook even if they infringe on your patents, which

17:19.820 --> 17:24.200
is questionable at best.

17:24.200 --> 17:30.700
And so Apache a few weeks ago, the Apache Foundation, actually back in July, it feels

17:30.700 --> 17:31.860
like a few weeks ago.

17:31.860 --> 17:32.860
It sure does.

17:32.860 --> 17:33.860
Where did some go?

17:33.860 --> 17:41.060
But anyway, they said that no new projects can use it, any software that has this license.

17:41.060 --> 17:45.540
And then more recently, Automatic, who are the developers of WordPress, announced that

17:45.540 --> 17:51.660
they are not going to use React in their next major update, which is called Gutenberg.

17:51.660 --> 17:57.220
And also, they were going to rewrite the last one called Calypso to not include it.

17:57.220 --> 18:03.080
And shortly after that announcement, here we are, Facebook have caved in and they have

18:03.080 --> 18:06.940
relicensed it as just plain old MIT.

18:06.940 --> 18:07.940
It's big news.

18:07.940 --> 18:11.620
But I think on one hand, it's kind of also not big news.

18:11.620 --> 18:15.020
The real takeaway I saw from a lot of this discussion is just software patents are a

18:15.020 --> 18:21.420
huge existential crisis that the software world is not really dealing with.

18:21.420 --> 18:25.780
And what Facebook did with this kind of nonstandard license is make everyone have to start thinking

18:25.780 --> 18:26.780
about patents.

18:26.780 --> 18:31.700
Because right now, now we're in a situation where under MIT, there's some legal opinions

18:31.700 --> 18:35.800
that MIT includes an implicit patent grant, but it doesn't specify that.

18:35.800 --> 18:39.260
So before you had an actual grant of the patents.

18:39.260 --> 18:42.100
With MIT, it's somewhat less clear.

18:42.100 --> 18:45.220
While you don't have this other clause that takes away some of your rights, you're not

18:45.220 --> 18:46.540
sure about the actual patents.

18:46.540 --> 18:50.820
The other part that just shows how messed up this whole situation is, is in all the

18:50.820 --> 18:54.460
discussions no one's even sure if there were like patents on some of these things.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.780
Do they have patents on what the technology underneath React?

18:57.780 --> 18:58.780
Nobody knows.

18:58.780 --> 18:59.780
It's too hard to tell.

18:59.780 --> 19:01.300
There's too many bad patents that exist.

19:01.300 --> 19:05.540
I can also somewhat understand Facebook's motivations originally because they put out

19:05.540 --> 19:07.340
a lot of open source software.

19:07.340 --> 19:11.820
And because of the patent situation, I'm sure they must get all kinds of frivolous lawsuits.

19:11.820 --> 19:16.020
And so this was their somewhat heavy handed attempt to try to put a stop to that.

19:16.020 --> 19:20.260
And while that's not ideal, I do value the amount of open source work that they do.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.220
They have a large number of developers, and they've given the world a lot of really good

19:23.220 --> 19:24.220
software.

19:24.220 --> 19:25.900
That's a very pragmatic view.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.100
And I haven't really heard that.

19:27.100 --> 19:32.100
All I've heard is, for the last few months, just ragging on Facebook saying that they're

19:32.100 --> 19:35.860
a terrible company and why they're taking advantage of people like this.

19:35.860 --> 19:40.380
So it's interesting to hear the other side of it and a more reasonable approach.

19:40.380 --> 19:45.020
Yeah, I'm hopeful that after this change, even if it's not really changed, it doesn't

19:45.020 --> 19:46.920
solve a giant problem.

19:46.920 --> 19:50.620
Even for WordPress, it sounds like WordPress's decision wasn't even that they were that concerned

19:50.620 --> 19:54.700
about the patent part, but that switching to the nonstandard license was causing other

19:54.700 --> 19:58.300
people to have concerns and they were worried that that would hurt WordPress adoption.

19:58.300 --> 20:01.460
So if we can just get back to a, you know, all right, well, no one's thinking about patents

20:01.460 --> 20:05.340
anymore and people can continue to use React, which I personally, that's my framework of

20:05.340 --> 20:06.340
choice for UI work.

20:06.340 --> 20:08.220
I think it's a great technology.

20:08.220 --> 20:09.940
I'd like to see it continue to succeed.

20:09.940 --> 20:16.420
Yeah, and Matt Mullenweg, I think that's how you say it, who is the founder of WordPress,

20:16.420 --> 20:21.300
has written a blog post a few hours ago that hasn't quite cleared up whether or not they

20:21.300 --> 20:25.780
are going to go with it, you know, to change their mind basically back to going with it.

20:25.780 --> 20:29.760
But they've certainly left the door open with his blog post there.

20:29.760 --> 20:34.580
So we'll have to see because my understanding is it is a very popular framework.

20:34.580 --> 20:36.220
Yes, very much so.

20:36.220 --> 20:40.940
It sort of changed the way people looked at frameworks because it operates on this diffing

20:40.940 --> 20:41.940
mechanism.

20:41.940 --> 20:46.060
So instead of having to, you know, manually update various things, add a new div or something,

20:46.060 --> 20:48.020
you just describe what you want it to look like.

20:48.020 --> 20:50.620
React handles all the automatic diffing and figures that out for you.

20:50.620 --> 20:54.860
So it makes it really simple to work with, very clean UI architectures that you can build.

20:54.860 --> 20:59.900
There are some like drop-in compatible, Preact is one, basically API compatible with React,

20:59.900 --> 21:01.780
but by going there, you lose out.

21:01.780 --> 21:06.540
Like Facebook just has such, not only dominance, but just they have such infrastructure and,

21:06.540 --> 21:10.980
you know, just sheer number of developer hours, plus with the React ecosystem, you get things

21:10.980 --> 21:12.300
like React Native.

21:12.300 --> 21:15.340
So if you already have, you know, you're a web developer, maybe you don't know how to

21:15.340 --> 21:19.420
write Objective-C, but with React Native, maybe you don't have to.

21:19.420 --> 21:22.100
That seems like it'd be really lucrative, especially if you work on a small startup

21:22.100 --> 21:23.100
or a small team.

21:23.100 --> 21:26.140
Well, hopefully people will be less reluctant to use it now.

21:26.140 --> 21:30.740
I know people were worried about it and hopefully this has put that fire out.

21:30.740 --> 21:31.740
Exactly.

21:31.740 --> 21:37.900
So speaking of patents, then Red Hat have announced a broad expansion to their open

21:37.900 --> 21:40.300
patents promise.

21:40.300 --> 21:46.940
And that promise is to not sue you for using any of their patents as long as the software

21:46.940 --> 21:49.300
is open source.

21:49.300 --> 21:53.860
Now what has been expanded here is that it's now going to cover permissive licenses.

21:53.860 --> 21:59.320
So pretty much anything that is OSI or FSF approved is covered.

21:59.320 --> 22:05.320
So the Open Source Initiative and the Free Software Foundation have got these lists of

22:05.320 --> 22:12.620
approved licenses and it pretty much means any open source license is covered.

22:12.620 --> 22:18.540
And they have got over 2,000 software patents, it seems, Red Hat.

22:18.540 --> 22:22.960
So it's good to see them extend this promise and people can sleep that little bit easier

22:22.960 --> 22:24.300
at night now, hopefully.

22:24.300 --> 22:28.300
Yeah, and it's, you know, it's one of those interesting, we live in such a business dominated

22:28.300 --> 22:29.300
world.

22:29.300 --> 22:33.300
It's kind of nice we have good actors like Red Hat here who really, I mean, obviously

22:33.300 --> 22:36.580
they make their money, it's good for their business model to support open source.

22:36.580 --> 22:40.180
But you know, when you're a small open source developer, maybe you want to launch your new

22:40.180 --> 22:44.820
product or you're just trying to, you know, help and support people in the United States.

22:44.820 --> 22:47.780
Trying to interact with the patent system, trying to understand that, trying to even

22:47.780 --> 22:49.920
just begin, that's a nightmare.

22:49.920 --> 22:52.320
You don't have a budget for a lawyer.

22:52.320 --> 22:53.320
Red Hat certainly does.

22:53.320 --> 22:56.940
So if they can be this bridge between the open source community and the legal community

22:56.940 --> 23:00.460
and just make sure that, yes, we are not going to do this, we're setting the standard that

23:00.460 --> 23:04.880
if you're doing open source software, we realize you're not like a, you're not a business competitor,

23:04.880 --> 23:07.300
you're not trying to take advantage of our patents.

23:07.300 --> 23:11.100
I imagine there's a lot of people at Red Hat who don't even like all these software patents,

23:11.100 --> 23:14.340
but to be defensive in the industry, they have to have them.

23:14.340 --> 23:16.820
Here they're just on the open source side, which is great.

23:16.820 --> 23:20.880
So how much of this is actually going to be a practical benefit to people and how much

23:20.880 --> 23:24.800
is it just a publicity grab by them, you know, trying to improve their image that little

23:24.800 --> 23:25.920
bit further?

23:25.920 --> 23:26.920
That is a good question.

23:26.920 --> 23:30.740
You definitely want to be seen as this open source friendly company.

23:30.740 --> 23:35.320
There is a lot of details here reading through their actual patent promise, you know, covered

23:35.320 --> 23:37.080
free and open source software.

23:37.080 --> 23:42.640
So it seems a lot more clear now whether or not projects are actually even considering

23:42.640 --> 23:43.640
this.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.520
I think there is kind of a put your head in the sand approach to patents a lot of the

23:46.520 --> 23:49.760
time where we're just not going to look, we're not going to investigate, just do it.

23:49.760 --> 23:53.240
If someone sees us down the road, then I guess we deal with it then.

23:53.240 --> 23:57.600
I don't know how practical this is, but if you happen to be using some Red Hat technology,

23:57.600 --> 23:59.720
I guess you're in the clear.
