00:00.000 --> 00:09.900
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 229, recorded on February 23rd, 2022.

00:09.900 --> 00:10.900
I'm Chris.

00:10.900 --> 00:11.900
And I'm Wes.

00:11.900 --> 00:12.900
Hello, Wes.

00:12.900 --> 00:15.120
Let's do the news.

00:15.120 --> 00:25.000
We start with the next generation of the TrueNAS platform, TrueNAS Scale 2202 has been released.

00:25.000 --> 00:35.220
Unlike FreeNAS and TrueNAS 13, though, Scale is based on Linux, Debian Linux, to be specific.

00:35.220 --> 00:40.520
When IX Systems announced that back in the summer of 2020, it's kind of a big deal, right?

00:40.520 --> 00:43.360
Because they were really seen as a BSD shop.

00:43.360 --> 00:48.120
And I remember them explaining some of the motivations and then mentioning KVM virtualization

00:48.120 --> 00:53.000
was in there, Docker container support and Kubernetes support, those things were all

00:53.000 --> 00:57.360
mentioned, but it just seemed like, wow, what a radical idea.

00:57.360 --> 01:02.040
But as time has gone on and the team has worked on this project, it's just made more and more

01:02.040 --> 01:05.160
sense and they've hit their milestones now.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.960
It's great to see this release.

01:06.960 --> 01:12.200
You know, we certainly like the BSDs here at Linux Action News, but there's no arguing

01:12.200 --> 01:17.560
that if you want to do more than just storage, you know, run some applications, well, the

01:17.560 --> 01:22.460
industry kind of expects things like Docker and Kubernetes these days.

01:22.460 --> 01:26.780
And for Scale, well, IX Systems had to put in some work to migrate all their old app

01:26.780 --> 01:32.280
capabilities that were using FreeBSD's jails over to their new Kubernetes infrastructure

01:32.280 --> 01:38.320
that's powered by their own version of Helm charts called TrueCharts.

01:38.320 --> 01:41.900
It's not all just taking of Linux goodies, though.

01:41.900 --> 01:49.320
They're pretty proud that they added NFS v4 Windows style ACLs to open ZFS on Linux.

01:49.320 --> 01:53.880
By default, Linux only has sort of more limited POSIX ACLs, but if you're going to use this

01:53.880 --> 02:00.080
thing as a robust storage solution for primarily Windows hosts, as many do, well, you're going

02:00.080 --> 02:02.280
to want fancy ACLs.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.360
That's actually really great.

02:03.360 --> 02:09.800
I have done crazy things like run RiserFS on top of SUSE to get ACL support.

02:09.800 --> 02:15.320
I ran Gen2 for a while to get extended attribute support for Windows clients.

02:15.320 --> 02:17.480
I moved mountains, Wes, I moved mountains.

02:17.480 --> 02:24.440
It's also noteworthy that IX Systems is still keeping TrueNAS 13, which is based on FreeBSD.

02:24.440 --> 02:28.320
It's still in production, and they still have it in their product lineup.

02:28.320 --> 02:34.240
In fact, they've got some terms to help customers pick which TrueNAS is best for them.

02:34.240 --> 02:42.000
They have the TrueNAS 13 scale up storage product, and now they have TrueNAS Scale 2202,

02:42.000 --> 02:45.880
which they say is a scale out hyper converged product.

02:45.880 --> 02:51.480
I think one is build storage up and one is scale out the actual application platform

02:51.480 --> 02:54.000
horizontally is how I read that.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.400
Yeah, with scale, they're actually integrating the Gluster file system on top of OpenZFS

03:00.400 --> 03:04.680
to sort of let you do exactly that kind of scaling out, which we haven't really seen

03:04.680 --> 03:07.240
before in the TrueNAS product line.

03:07.240 --> 03:12.080
All of this is a really compelling grouping of stuff, and so we are absolutely going to

03:12.080 --> 03:17.520
spend some time with this in studio and give it a full test on the future Linux unplugs.

03:17.520 --> 03:23.840
Keep an eye out for that, but I'm impressed, and I can clearly see this addressing the

03:23.840 --> 03:24.840
scale part.

03:24.840 --> 03:29.720
I mean, TrueNAS is a wide product range, but the scale aspect now based on Linux, I would

03:29.720 --> 03:36.080
really love to deploy this at previous clients of mine that have 20 to 200 people.

03:36.080 --> 03:41.080
They maybe buy one small business server that runs at their operation, and it's maybe their

03:41.080 --> 03:42.200
directory.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.800
It is their file server.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.440
This is less and less common these days, but there's still millions of them out there,

03:47.440 --> 03:51.640
millions of them, and now you could put something in there that's modern.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.160
It's easily supportable.

03:53.160 --> 03:54.320
It's easy to expand it.

03:54.320 --> 03:58.360
It can run all the different applications you need, and then also on the on the enthusiast

03:58.360 --> 04:02.700
side of the market, I could see this slowly eating away at the QNAP and Synology markets

04:02.700 --> 04:07.800
out there, at least on their high end, because the capabilities of this unit are going to

04:07.800 --> 04:13.840
be way more than the capabilities of those appliance units, and they've also just invested

04:13.840 --> 04:17.920
a ton in the UI, which is available on some of their other products, so they've got like

04:17.920 --> 04:25.120
a lot of R&D going into all aspects of this, and as a Linux user, I'm really excited now

04:25.120 --> 04:27.400
that they have a Linux based offering.

04:27.400 --> 04:33.160
I've been a FreeNAS fan before, but I ultimately migrated away because it was BSD based, and

04:33.160 --> 04:35.240
my skill set is in Linux.

04:35.240 --> 04:39.440
Although that might just mean you feel a little too confident about getting into that low

04:39.440 --> 04:45.600
level system shell and messing things up.

04:45.600 --> 04:49.200
Often when we talk to developers building tools out in the real world, or sometimes

04:49.200 --> 04:53.140
on the surface of Mars, they almost always tell us the same thing.

04:53.140 --> 04:57.160
They're actually running their gear that's based on Linux with the pre-amped RT real-time

04:57.160 --> 04:58.720
kernel patches.

04:58.720 --> 05:04.800
Well, the group behind that patch that has recently been acquired by Intel.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.720
In a statement on that acquisition, Intel said, quote,

05:08.720 --> 05:14.120
Linutronics is comprised of a team of highly qualified and motivated employees with a wealth

05:14.120 --> 05:19.040
of experience and involvement in the ongoing development of Linux.

05:19.040 --> 05:25.640
Led by CEO Heinz Eiger and CTO Thomas Kleiksner, Linutronics is the architect of pre-amped

05:25.640 --> 05:31.040
RT and the leading technology provider for industrial Linux.

05:31.040 --> 05:36.400
Particularly noteworthy is that Kleiksner has been the principal maintainer of the x86

05:36.400 --> 05:41.680
architecture in the kernel all the way back since 2008.

05:41.680 --> 05:44.240
Intel went on to say that, quote,

05:44.240 --> 05:48.920
By acquiring Linutronics, we're deepening our longstanding relationship with a highly

05:48.920 --> 05:53.760
respected team of globally recognized Linux experts, adding to the remarkable breadth

05:53.760 --> 05:57.000
and depth of Intel's hardware and software talent.

05:57.000 --> 06:02.440
Linutronics will continue to operate as an independent business within our software division,

06:02.440 --> 06:04.840
led by Eiger and Kleiksner.

06:04.840 --> 06:05.960
There's no way around it.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.320
This is a huge get for Intel.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.840
And it's noteworthy that they're specifically calling out that it's going to remain an independent

06:11.840 --> 06:14.480
business unit within the software division.

06:14.480 --> 06:20.960
So it's a department inside a department that likely reports to a lead.

06:20.960 --> 06:24.840
But nonetheless, I think this is actually a good move.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.560
Intel has been a good steward of the kernel.

06:26.560 --> 06:29.160
There has been some rough patches.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.160
There has been a few issues.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.760
But that's pretty normal when you look at the scope and depth of what Intel's involved

06:33.760 --> 06:34.760
in.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.840
And they participated with the kernel team for a long time.

06:36.840 --> 06:44.200
And it's also noteworthy that back in June of 2021, the team was seeing some funding

06:44.200 --> 06:45.640
issues, right?

06:45.640 --> 06:50.080
And so it's conceivable that they got to a point where they needed to get some kind

06:50.080 --> 06:51.080
of acquisition.

06:51.080 --> 06:55.280
So it may mean that now they get paid to do this full time.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.960
And this could be a good benefit for them as well.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.960
So overall, I can see a lot of positive upshot to this.

07:00.960 --> 07:04.320
And then I think the other thing that gives me some peace of mind is I don't see any kernel

07:04.320 --> 07:06.400
developers freaking out about it right now.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.680
They all seem pretty pleased.

07:07.680 --> 07:13.360
No, hopefully this just means more robust preempt RT support for a long time in the

07:13.360 --> 07:16.360
future.

07:16.360 --> 07:21.640
Podman 4.0 came out this week and the new version supports a new network stack while

07:21.640 --> 07:23.560
keeping compatibility with the old stack.

07:23.560 --> 07:24.560
So don't worry.

07:24.560 --> 07:25.560
It uses Netivark.

07:25.560 --> 07:29.200
It's a Rust based network stack for containers.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.720
Now don't worry if you're not ready.

07:31.720 --> 07:34.800
Only new installs of Podman will be getting Netivark by default.

07:34.800 --> 07:39.560
You'll still be using OCI networking if you previously were using Podman.

07:39.560 --> 07:46.120
Another big focus for Podman 4.0 was improving the Podman experience on non Linux operating

07:46.120 --> 07:47.120
systems.

07:47.120 --> 07:52.060
Yes, yes, I know we try not to mention them, but Windows and Mac OS do exist.

07:52.060 --> 07:56.860
Support for Podman on those platforms is enabled by Podman Machine, which somewhat like how

07:56.860 --> 08:01.160
Docker Desktop does it, basically creates and manages a virtual machine under the hood

08:01.160 --> 08:03.840
that actually runs all your containers.

08:03.840 --> 08:11.080
Now Podman Machine is not new in this release, but it has seen some really nice improvements.

08:11.080 --> 08:16.880
Particularly that Podman Machine now automatically mounts the Podman API socket to your host

08:16.880 --> 08:17.880
system.

08:17.880 --> 08:24.480
So if you're using the regular Docker CLI or, important for our use cases, Docker Compose,

08:24.480 --> 08:30.680
you can just point that at the Podman socket, forget about Docker, perhaps entirely.

08:30.680 --> 08:36.520
Another nice improvement is WSL2 support on Windows.

08:36.520 --> 08:41.500
This means that instead of creating a QEMU based virtual machine, Podman can hook into

08:41.500 --> 08:45.840
the Windows subsystem for Linux directly and get all the nice features that Microsoft's

08:45.840 --> 08:48.040
been baking in there.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.280
Now it's not all quite good news.

08:50.280 --> 08:55.440
One thing I was hoping to see in 4.0 was support for volume mounts from the host.

08:55.440 --> 08:59.880
I want my containers to be able to interact with the files I might have on my Mac or Windows

08:59.880 --> 09:01.360
desktop.

09:01.360 --> 09:09.360
We didn't get that with 4.0, but sounds like that's coming in version 4.1.

09:09.360 --> 09:14.040
This week, the executive director of the GNOME Foundation gave us a heads up that his term

09:14.040 --> 09:15.720
is coming to an end.

09:15.720 --> 09:20.240
Neil McGovern has been there nearly five years and he's decided the timing is right to step

09:20.240 --> 09:23.000
back from GNOME and start looking for its next leader.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.920
It's been an interesting five years though.

09:25.920 --> 09:29.160
As a foundation, they've gone from a small team of just about three to now employing

09:29.160 --> 09:34.320
people to work on marketing, investment in technical frameworks, conference organization,

09:34.320 --> 09:36.000
and really a lot more.

09:36.000 --> 09:41.800
And of course, during this time, GNOME has become the default on many major Linux distributions.

09:41.800 --> 09:46.960
And something I've watched blossom while Neil has been the executive director is Flathub.

09:46.960 --> 09:52.240
Even if they just as a project just help them, encourage them, it's been great to see this

09:52.240 --> 09:56.120
flourish and now it gives developers a way to publish applications directly to their

09:56.120 --> 10:00.560
users and for users like me to discover applications on a daily basis.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.940
All powered by free software.

10:02.940 --> 10:05.800
Of course, it hasn't all been fun and games.

10:05.800 --> 10:10.920
During his tenure, Neil also helped the foundation deal with patent suits, trademark disputes,

10:10.920 --> 10:12.440
and by-law changes.

10:12.440 --> 10:18.160
He also helped oversee the move of the entire GNOME development platform to GitLab, while

10:18.160 --> 10:26.280
at the same time seeing 10 new GNOME releases, the development of GTK4, and of course a monumental

10:26.280 --> 10:29.000
release itself in GNOME 40.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.260
If you're curious to hear a little bit about his perspective, well, this here show did

10:33.260 --> 10:38.860
an interview with Neil back in Linux Action News 182, which we'll have linked in the show

10:38.860 --> 10:39.860
notes.

10:39.860 --> 10:43.360
It's also noteworthy that GNOME 42 beta landed this week.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.000
This is a feature freeze release.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.760
This is a great one to help the team track down last minute bugs.

10:48.760 --> 10:52.520
A lot of big core components have been ported to GTK4.

10:52.520 --> 10:57.560
Dark theme support, like real dark theme support has been added to several applications now.

10:57.560 --> 11:00.280
GNOME Shell and Mudder also see a lot of changes and improvements.

11:00.280 --> 11:03.100
What I'm saying is big things have landed.

11:03.100 --> 11:08.080
It's definitely worth testing and this is going to be a very special version of GNOME.

11:08.080 --> 11:12.960
Well, we've been following this next story for a little while and it actually looks like

11:12.960 --> 11:17.120
the hardware side of all of the rumors is getting really close.

11:17.120 --> 11:23.400
So back in January of 2020, Google said it would bring Steam to Chromebooks.

11:23.400 --> 11:26.840
And now it seems like that plan is really starting to get close.

11:26.840 --> 11:35.360
Yeah, it appears that HP, Lenovo, Acer, and Asus are going to be releasing some gaming

11:35.360 --> 11:41.240
focused Chromebooks using Project Borealis, which is Google's code name for bringing

11:41.240 --> 11:43.760
Steam support to Chrome OS.

11:43.760 --> 11:49.540
9to5Google has been doing some excellent work sleuthing around in the code base and according

11:49.540 --> 11:55.880
to a developer comment from January, Google now has firm timelines for when this stuff

11:55.880 --> 12:01.400
actually needs to ship and we maybe have some requirements for what your Chromebook would

12:01.400 --> 12:09.360
need, which include an 11th gen Intel Core i5 or i7 and a minimum of 7 gigs of RAM, which

12:09.360 --> 12:14.840
kind of eliminates all but those Chromebooks that are really in the upper mid or high end

12:14.840 --> 12:15.840
range.

12:15.840 --> 12:21.320
Another interesting little tidbit about this is that Nvidia appears to be directly involved

12:21.320 --> 12:25.920
with the development of Steam support on Chrome OS with some of the code changes actually

12:25.920 --> 12:29.360
being developed and submitted by Nvidia employees.

12:29.360 --> 12:34.920
I can't say I really understand what's going on, but it'll certainly be interesting to

12:34.920 --> 12:41.800
see how Google's plans for Chrome OS continue to play out.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.720
Linode.com slash LAN.

12:43.720 --> 12:48.080
Linode makes cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible and when you go to Linode.com

12:48.080 --> 12:53.680
slash LAN, you'll get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you can go there to support

12:53.680 --> 12:54.920
the show.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.840
Linode is fast and reliable.

12:56.840 --> 13:02.400
Put simply, it's the only place we host user facing content machines like our systems that

13:02.400 --> 13:04.660
are designed to serve you up stuff.

13:04.660 --> 13:11.080
Anything we build, we put it up on Linode and now that Linode has upgraded to MVME storage,

13:11.080 --> 13:13.440
your systems can fly on there.

13:13.440 --> 13:16.220
I mean, you'll get performance like you've never seen before.

13:16.220 --> 13:21.000
You can get massive parallelism with MVME drives and so if you've got a database, something

13:21.000 --> 13:25.600
that helps maybe like, I don't know, keep track of user information or backend stuff

13:25.600 --> 13:29.000
that has a lot of IOPS, you might want to look at that.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.640
In fact, Linode's support, which is excellent, can also help you work through these kinds

13:32.640 --> 13:33.640
of things.

13:33.640 --> 13:37.360
They've got a range of systems that you can pick depending on what your needs are.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.800
And don't worry, it's all simple and easy to sort through.

13:39.800 --> 13:44.200
They've been doing this for 19 years and they just keep getting better and better.

13:44.200 --> 13:48.180
And now they're powered by Akamai, so it's going to get taken to the next level.

13:48.180 --> 13:49.520
Go try it for yourself.

13:49.520 --> 13:53.560
It's real, it's here, and you can get $100 in credit while you support the show.

13:53.560 --> 13:58.480
Linode.com slash LAN.

13:58.480 --> 14:01.920
And a big thank you to Ting, linux.ting.com.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.640
Go there and take $25 off.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.920
This is my cell phone provider.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.680
I've been a customer since 2013.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.760
It's just a simpler way to do mobile.

14:10.760 --> 14:14.340
Ting is an MVNO or a mobile virtual network operator.

14:14.340 --> 14:16.600
They run on top of the carrier networks.

14:16.600 --> 14:21.720
They interface with those awful duopolies and create a meta company that is great to

14:21.720 --> 14:25.520
work with, that is customer focused and has fantastic support.

14:25.520 --> 14:31.040
And I can say that because again, I've been a customer since 2013 and their plans are

14:31.040 --> 14:32.040
simple.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.760
Go to linux.ting.com, review them.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.320
They got one that's going to work for everybody.

14:36.320 --> 14:39.760
Really it's a great option for small businesses and family too.

14:39.760 --> 14:45.400
Often I talk about the individual possibility to save, but if you've got like five or more

14:45.400 --> 14:49.600
lines, the savings could really add up with Ting.

14:49.600 --> 14:53.920
It's tremendous and every plan gets access to Ting's award-winning customer service with

14:53.920 --> 14:56.500
nationwide LTE and 5G.

14:56.500 --> 15:01.440
And of course, Ting just recently was named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports

15:01.440 --> 15:02.940
in 2021.

15:02.940 --> 15:06.340
So it's simple to switch to Ting and there's no contracts ever.

15:06.340 --> 15:09.840
And pretty much any phone's going to work because of Ting's multi-network support.

15:09.840 --> 15:14.220
So just go to linux.ting.com, check your current phone, create an account and pick the plan

15:14.220 --> 15:15.220
that's right for you.

15:15.220 --> 15:18.040
Ting will send you a SIM card, you pop that in your phone and you're going to get activated

15:18.040 --> 15:19.040
in minutes.

15:19.040 --> 15:23.280
It happened so quick, you won't believe you weren't saving money earlier than this.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.520
You can thank me later.

15:24.520 --> 15:28.440
Go to linux.ting.com.

15:28.440 --> 15:35.200
We bring you back to reality just for a moment to tell you about a new Linux-powered virtual

15:35.200 --> 15:37.820
reality device.

15:37.820 --> 15:44.360
It's called the Simula One and it's a full portable Linux computer built right into a

15:44.360 --> 15:46.920
VR headset.

15:46.920 --> 15:53.720
Powered by WL Roots and the open source Godot game engine with NixOS under the hood.

15:53.720 --> 15:57.800
And best of all, it's not made by Meta.

15:57.800 --> 15:58.800
No it is not.

15:58.800 --> 16:03.320
In fact, the team behind it has been working on this for about four years.

16:03.320 --> 16:08.600
And one of the things that really makes this headset stand out from all of the other VR

16:08.600 --> 16:12.440
headsets on the market, besides the fact that it has a Linux box strapped to it, is the

16:12.440 --> 16:21.000
super high resolution screen, 35.5 pixel per degree, with a real focus on making your VR

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
terminals look good.

16:22.000 --> 16:27.040
Yeah, I'm talking your text terminal in VR because the team stresses they are focused

16:27.040 --> 16:31.680
on work and productivity, not gaming.

16:31.680 --> 16:35.120
Now this thing also features a detachable computer so you can actually take that Linux

16:35.120 --> 16:40.580
box off and then dock it on a desktop unit at some point in the future.

16:40.580 --> 16:45.000
And I have to say it is actually kind of nice to see some Linux action in this VR space

16:45.000 --> 16:50.220
because so far this has really been felt like it's been dominated by commercial players.

16:50.220 --> 16:53.880
Which speaking of, I tried one this weekend for the first time.

16:53.880 --> 16:58.140
So if I would have seen this news story last week, I would have been Mr. Skeptical pants

16:58.140 --> 16:59.140
on here.

16:59.140 --> 17:04.940
I would have told you the price is outrageous, the idea is silly, I can just get monitors,

17:04.940 --> 17:06.920
all that kind of stuff.

17:06.920 --> 17:11.440
But I just happened to actually try a virtual work environment this weekend.

17:11.440 --> 17:16.160
And I have changed my tune a little bit.

17:16.160 --> 17:21.640
Having unlimited monitors at any size is like a utopia for me.

17:21.640 --> 17:27.920
Sitting here right now recording this, I have one, two, three, four, five physical screens.

17:27.920 --> 17:32.480
And that's not even counting like meters and stuff like that, spectrum analyzers, I'm just

17:32.480 --> 17:34.360
talking computer screens.

17:34.360 --> 17:38.960
And I mean, we definitely want a few more in the studio if we had anywhere to put them.

17:38.960 --> 17:39.960
I really would.

17:39.960 --> 17:43.720
And like when I'm recording shows with remote hosts, I'd love to do that in a virtual studio

17:43.720 --> 17:44.720
environment.

17:44.720 --> 17:48.360
And this is where it really started to click for me, is when I realized at home, I have

17:48.360 --> 17:52.960
a tiny home, a very small space, it's not a private space to work.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.160
I can put on this VR headset.

17:55.160 --> 18:02.480
And I'm in a gigantic studio log cabin with a wood ceiling, panoramic windows that look

18:02.480 --> 18:07.320
down on a lake with fog, with rain that drips down those windows, and I've got a big blue

18:07.320 --> 18:08.320
couch.

18:08.320 --> 18:13.960
And I have got six ginormous, you know, 110 inch screens in front of me are running all

18:13.960 --> 18:15.600
kinds of stuff.

18:15.600 --> 18:19.440
And that's when I realized, man, I could take this virtual environment.

18:19.440 --> 18:23.720
And I could go to the studio or I could, I could go to a hotel room, I can put on this

18:23.720 --> 18:28.880
headset, and I am working right back in my infinite office, I can take my infinite office

18:28.880 --> 18:30.560
with me everywhere.

18:30.560 --> 18:34.940
But the missing piece was it needed to connect to a computer, I had to bring a laptop with

18:34.940 --> 18:37.040
me, which just isn't super portable.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.720
I mean, when I'm traveling, I'll just bring the laptop and that's good enough.

18:40.720 --> 18:45.240
But with Simula, they put the Linux box in the headset.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.020
That's the game changer.

18:47.020 --> 18:50.740
Having everything self contained, not being tethered to a full computer, but having the

18:50.740 --> 18:54.360
headset itself be a full computer.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.840
That's a game changer when it comes to VR.

18:56.840 --> 18:59.800
Now there's so much that's going to it's like the smartphone West, it's like you got to

18:59.800 --> 19:03.880
have an ecosystem, it can't really just be a single purpose device.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.160
So I'm still a bit skeptical here.

19:06.160 --> 19:11.360
But man, it looks like the team has really worked hard on a really good software hardware

19:11.360 --> 19:12.640
combination.

19:12.640 --> 19:17.080
Everything checks the boxes I was looking at, it's got an i7 under the hood, it's going

19:17.080 --> 19:21.840
to have 16 gigabytes of RAM, it'll have Intel Xe graphics.

19:21.840 --> 19:26.180
So you know, you're going to have a really good desktop Linux experience with this thing.

19:26.180 --> 19:32.320
But I fear, West, this is one of those things you got to try to really appreciate.

19:32.320 --> 19:38.120
And at this price point, I don't think enough people will be convinced on the premise to

19:38.120 --> 19:39.120
go all in.

19:39.120 --> 19:41.280
What do you think?

19:41.280 --> 19:46.960
You know, I do share some of your concerns a lot about VR right now has has social aspects.

19:46.960 --> 19:51.840
And as you say, many are not convinced about the possibilities here.

19:51.840 --> 19:55.480
I can see what they're getting at though, you know, longer term, we may have multiple

19:55.480 --> 19:59.960
VR systems, you might have one thing that your gaming setup, whereas you want a slightly

19:59.960 --> 20:04.880
tweaked setup to get your sys admin or development job done during the day.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.780
But yeah, it's pricey.

20:07.780 --> 20:12.640
So it's probably worth pointing out that you don't actually need this fancy new hardware

20:12.640 --> 20:13.880
if you don't want it.

20:13.880 --> 20:18.160
The underlying window manager and operating stuff, I mean, it's all out in the open and

20:18.160 --> 20:24.520
Simula, that customized environment built on top of Godot, well, it's officially compatible

20:24.520 --> 20:27.800
with Steam VR headsets like the Valve Index.

20:27.800 --> 20:31.880
There's experimental support for some open XR headsets.

20:31.880 --> 20:36.640
And while this being Linux, some enterprising hackers have gotten it kind of working with

20:36.640 --> 20:42.740
the Oculus Rift S. But that hardware does look really nice.

20:42.740 --> 20:47.800
And if you'd like to see these initial takes at Linux VR continue, you may want to consider

20:47.800 --> 20:48.800
supporting it.

20:48.800 --> 20:53.360
They're working on a Kickstarter, hoping to raise 2.5 million.

20:53.360 --> 20:56.000
We'll have a link in the show notes.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.200
I mean, that's not an impossible goal.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.280
We'll see where it goes.

20:59.280 --> 21:05.080
But be it in the real world or the virtual world, if it involves Linux or open source,

21:05.080 --> 21:07.240
we are going to cover it right here.
