00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,320
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 238, recorded on April 7th, 2022. I'm Chris.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,320
And I'm Wes.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,300
Hello, Wes. Let's do the news.

4
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:20,780
We start this week, in the midst of the spring release season, with the new 22.04 LTS version

5
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,780
of Pop!OS hitting the mirrors.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:30,120
That's on top of the well-received Ubuntu 22.04 core, System76's release is putting an emphasis

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:37,000
on workflow customization, auto-tiling, and a heavy focus on a ready-to-go development

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,600
environment.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,480
And 22.04 features their GNOME-based Cosmic Desktop, which is really pretty close in terms

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,180
of overall look and theme from what you saw in 21.10, but of course now with improvements

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:55,200
throughout some of those that you get just by now being based on GNOME 42, and all of

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,840
the goodies that has, including GTK4, which means you're going to see some improvements

13
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,000
in performance likely as well.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,080
And one thing that I wanted to mention that just sort of jumped out at me was Pop!OS 22.04

15
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,760
now introduces this updated support panel in the GNOME Settings app. And in there, this

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,020
page tells you what your computer and OS model and version are. It provides links to documentation

17
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:24,080
and the Pop! community chat, and the ability to archive your recent logs up and send them

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,740
off to support.

19
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:31,400
Pop! Shop also received some nice updates, now highlights recently updated apps, and

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:37,480
features improved package management operations. But with those more, let's say, mundane

21
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:43,500
changes out of the way, one of the bigger changes as far as we're personally concerned,

22
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,960
Pop! now defaults to Pipewire.

23
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,120
This feels like a big step because this is an LTS release, let's keep in mind. And so

24
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:56,360
this is something maybe we wouldn't have expected traditionally, but I love it. And I think

25
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,640
that personally, you take some decisions like that, and you combine them with System76's

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,560
commitment to ship newer kernels as they release. That to me is going to be an interesting recipe

27
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,660
for a new kind of LTS that I want to keep my eyes on.

28
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,920
And speaking of those updates, Pop! 2204 has automatic update options now in the GNOME

29
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,240
panel that you can set like a time of day and week to automatically do the updates for

30
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:28,240
the system. And in there, there is now an option for not just Debian packages, not just

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,160
Flatpacks, but for Nix packages as well.

32
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,720
Wait, Nix? Really?

33
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,280
Isn't that something? I did not expect this. I haven't followed the beta super closely

34
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,400
for this. And so I was really surprised when I saw this. We dug into this a bit. We'll

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,240
have some links in the show notes, and we've emailed System76 for more information. But

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:57,320
it seems that there's like a backend service called the Pop! System Updater. And this has

37
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,120
facilities for these different types of packages that you might have installed, Debs, Flatpacks,

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,720
and Nix packages.

39
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:12,320
And of course, it's written in Rust. It's not all good news just yet, though. It's

40
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,640
probably worth mentioning that the Raspberry Pi 4 images for 2204 with Pop! Well, they're

41
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,680
not quite ready yet. So the ones available are still based on 2110. But it does sound

42
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:31,400
like work is underway. We'll just have to be a little bit patient.

43
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,960
While speaking of Ubuntu 2204, one of the new features Canonical drew attention to during

44
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,160
the release was the support for a real time kernel beta. But now we're learning some

45
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,000
more details on how that's exactly going to work.

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,720
Now most of us never actually need a quote real time kernel day to day. But for some

47
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:59,280
industrial applications, a guaranteed window of execution is absolutely critical. You know,

48
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,820
for industries like telecom, manufacturing, and of course, space robots. And while real

49
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:13,200
time patches, known as preempt RT, have been out there for years now, there was never really

50
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,520
an official way to get that kernel built on Ubuntu and supported by Canonical.

51
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:26,280
Well, 2204, that's changing. Well, as long as you're willing to sign up for Ubuntu

52
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,600
Advantage. If you're interested, there is the free tier of Canonical's Linux enterprise

53
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,960
subscription plan with extended security maintenance, kernel line patching support, landscape, and

54
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,600
a few other offerings. Now, that comes with the Ubuntu real time kernel access as well.

55
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,760
I suppose this isn't super surprising. This is a kind of a continuation of Canonical's

56
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,880
enterprise OS as a service. You can get the free Ubuntu, you can even run it for five

57
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,180
years for free. But if you want to pay for Ubuntu Advantage, you get all of these enterprise

58
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,880
capabilities that make it appealing. And it sells itself to a lot of customers. And now

59
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,320
they're adding another perk to that program, another feature set to that program. I was

60
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,000
actually surprised by the real time kernel support itself, because didn't really see

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,120
it come up much during the beta. It wasn't in the repos. So you know, we didn't see it

62
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,920
like at one point, I did look at all the available kernels. But now we know why because it's

63
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,760
been rolled into this Ubuntu Advantage program. And so it's going to be coming from there.

64
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,760
And I wouldn't be surprised going forward, if we see other enterprise specific features

65
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,760
may be similar to this or in the same vein, show up as Ubuntu Advantage only over time,

66
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,760
maybe with some time, a free PPA becomes available or something like this. But this does seem

67
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:51,640
to be a continuation of this idea they have to monetize Ubuntu on the server. And when

68
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,080
their goal is to IPO next year, it makes sense that they would be wanting to add competitive

69
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,280
features like this.

70
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,480
What feels like a million years ago, back in 2020, we covered the new NTFS file system

71
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,040
driver that Paragon software was contributing to the kernel. This driver was previously

72
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,840
a proprietary commercial offering from Paragon, who after years of selling that commercial

73
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,960
driver decided to contribute that code upstream. It features full read write support and a

74
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,960
ton of other features that were not found in the old NTFS driver.

75
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:36,040
Right, this was seen as a bit of a moment because finally, we would have a real true

76
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:44,520
safe NTFS driver in Linux. And then when we covered the actual deployment in Linux 515,

77
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:51,240
we thought, well, okay, we can wipe our hands of this. It's a start of a new era. We have

78
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:58,280
full NTFS support in Linux. It was time to format your drives, boys.

79
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, it was a sweet, sweet feeling. But seems not destined to last because unfortunately,

80
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,560
less than one year later, concerns are being raised that the driver is already orphaned

81
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:20,440
and not being actively maintained. Paragon software did pledge to keep the driver maintained

82
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,840
as part of the process of getting it upstreamed into the kernel. But since 515 landed, there

83
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:33,520
haven't been any major updates, despite there even being a few fixes already queued up.

84
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,840
Man, that is unfortunate. And you know, the kernel team tried to get that pledge. Yeah,

85
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,880
hey, all right, we'll do this. But don't leave us high and dry. And props to Michael Larbel

86
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,800
over at Feronix, who kind of put all this together. And he notes that one of the developers

87
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,240
that contributed a number of patches to that NTFS3 code during the review process, Cary

88
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,160
Oligrander, well, they raised concerns over the state of the Paragon driver to several

89
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:04,080
people. They've also noted that they've been unable to get any response from Paragon's

90
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,440
maintainer. It's been virtual radio silence.

91
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,760
Yeah, Cary raised those concerns on the mailing list and kind of classified the driver as

92
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:19,120
this point being effectively orphaned at the same time making an offer to co maintain the

93
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,800
driver. Although that offer is complicated because so far, there's been no response yet

94
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,000
from the currently recognized maintainer.

95
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,360
Oh, what a mess, Wes. What a what a stinking mess. You hate to see this happen. And now

96
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,160
it's naturally raised questions if this driver should be removed from the mainline, or at

97
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,680
least what action should be taken now. We'll definitely be keeping our eyes on this one,

98
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:52,160
but maybe don't rely too much on that NTFS support on Linux for now.

99
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,800
Checking in on the slow rollout of the Steam Deck for a moment, it seems sales have remained

100
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,720
strong. The Deck has held the number two top grossing product on Steam for five weeks in

101
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,440
a row, according to SteamDB. And this week, the Steam Deck grossed more sales than even

102
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,640
the massively popular new game Elden Ring.

103
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:20,640
And probably all this success likely means delays the our Steam Deck community estimates

104
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:28,240
that Valve is still working through the first 15 minutes of pre orders from July 16 2021.

105
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,520
Now it depends on the model you ordered. Some queues have been moving faster, but the US

106
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:39,400
only just made it past hour one, and only with the 64 gigabyte model. Now this is changing

107
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,620
all the time. So we'll put a link to that thread so you can get the most up to date

108
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,920
community estimates.

109
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,840
And while most of us sit here and wait, the Decks client software keeps getting better

110
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:59,080
and better. From pushing firmware updates, OS fixes, and just some nice to have features,

111
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:05,640
it seems like Valve is pushing development ahead at a pretty rapid pace. Though it does

112
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:11,840
leave us wondering a bit if it might still be some time before we see a standalone release

113
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,400
of SteamOS 3.

114
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,480
Oh, come on, Valve. We want it already. Although I could see what you're saying there. If they're

115
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,760
still doing a bunch of updates, they're probably not likely to drop it over the fence for the

116
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
public yet.

117
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,420
Let us test it for you, Valve. We'll give it a go. There's also good news in Deckland,

118
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:35,000
the compatibility layer that makes those Windows games go on Steam and on the Deck. That got

119
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,200
a solid update this week. Proton 7.0-2 is out now, and it is considered the new main

120
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:48,000
stable version of Proton going forward. And it has an impressive new list of games that

121
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,240
are now playable via Proton. And that Elden Ring we just mentioned is one of them, as

122
00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:00,040
well as many others.

123
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,960
As you may have noticed, Matrix is one of our favorite up and coming platforms. And

124
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:13,320
in some exciting news, the leading chat client Element has rolled out threads in beta.

125
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,600
Threads help you separate conversations from the main timeline. Starting a new thread opens

126
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,540
a thread view where you can continue your conversation without interruption or interrupting

127
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:28,520
any other conversations or topics that are going on in the main timeline. It's really

128
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,720
quite great to see this feature roll out as more and more free software projects and fans

129
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:39,960
adopt Matrix as sort of their main place to communicate. But it's also been nice to

130
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:45,240
see because Element the client, well, it just keeps getting better with improvement after

131
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:51,720
improvement and more layers of polish. If you haven't checked it out in a while, maybe

132
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,320
go create an account on Matrix.org and then join us in the Linux Action News Feedback

133
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,880
channel that we'll have linked in the show notes.

134
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:10,200
Linode.com slash LAN. Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you

135
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,320
go there to support the show. Linode is the Linux geeks cloud with 11 data centers worldwide.

136
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,220
They've been hard at work for almost 19 years, creating the best experience for running applications

137
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,520
on Linux. If you need a personal small site or you need something that's going to possibly

138
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:30,640
entertain millions of visitors, they have systems that scale to that. I was just thinking

139
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,200
of the large box that we deployed for our Matrix installation just recently. That's

140
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,020
a great example. I think we started at a $10 a month Linode and then over time we just

141
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:47,520
resized it as we needed. As the user base grew, we resized the system to meet our needs

142
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:53,240
and it's worked so great. Now we have a system with 48 cores and 96 gigs of RAM. You know,

143
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,120
it's pretty screaming fast and also you can get them now with NVMe PCIe storage. So it

144
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,820
can just be unbelievably fast on disk IO as well. And they have the best customer support,

145
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:08,800
super fast rigs and networking, and a Linux culture that runs deep in that company. There's

146
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,320
so many great reasons to choose Linode. After you've been using it for a minute, you'll

147
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,360
come up with a list of your own. And if you're like me, you'll really appreciate that you

148
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,800
can tell where the Linux love is baked into the product. So go put it over the top and

149
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,880
get $100 in credit. Try it for yourself. See why I've been talking about it and support

150
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,120
the show. What a great opportunity. So it's linode.com slash LAN. You go there, you get

151
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,120
that $100, you create the new account, you build something, you learn something. Linode.com

152
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:45,200
slash LAN. Linux.ting.com. And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring this episode of

153
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,840
Linux Action News. Ting has been my cell phone provider since 2013. So go to linux.ting.com

154
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:58,060
and see how much you could save and then take $25 off by using our URL. Ting is an MVNO

155
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,000
or a mobile virtual network operator. That means they don't focus on digging holes in

156
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,820
the grounds and working with all the different local regulations. They work as a meta network

157
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:12,440
on top of the big nationwide carriers. So they get access to the same LTE and 5G networks.

158
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:16,440
But you deal with Ting who has to focus on customer support and value to survive. It's

159
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:23,000
like their whole bread and butter is customer service. Right? Where the duopolies, they

160
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,560
just they get you locked in and you know what that service is like. And Ting was recently

161
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:34,240
named number one by Consumer Reports in 2021. And I think what I love about Ting is their

162
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,980
plans are always simple and straightforward. They've changed them over the years a bit

163
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,640
as the industry has evolved, but they've always remained simple and easy to understand. And

164
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:49,040
one thing that's always stayed true. No contracts ever. It's simple to switch to Ting. And pretty

165
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,060
much any phone will work. You'll be blown away by the prices. They have cell phone plans

166
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,940
that are as cheap as 30 bucks a month, 15 bucks a month, depending on what you need.

167
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,540
You know, maybe you don't use your phone a lot. Maybe you use it a ton. Maybe you need

168
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,240
a data device. They also will sell you a device and you can take 25 bucks off that when you

169
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,600
go to linux.ting.com. Go check your current phone, create an account and pick the plan

170
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:21,400
that's right for you. It's linux.ting.com.

171
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:27,880
The folks behind the modular laptop, the framework have now made the laptops mainboard available

172
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,640
as a standalone component in the framework marketplace. They write in their announcement

173
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:40,120
quote, we designed the mainboard from the start as a standalone module to make upgrades

174
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:46,680
easy in the framework laptop. All you need to do is insert some memory, plug in a USB-C

175
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:53,640
power adapter and hit the tiny power button on board and you've got a powered up computer.

176
00:15:53,640 --> 00:16:00,040
I love this idea and it's so great that they designed this mainboard from the beginning

177
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,520
to be standalone like this. What a cool idea. And not only just that Wes, but they've also

178
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,760
released a GitHub repository with 80 different CAD drawings. They've got electrical documentation

179
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,200
on there for the mainboard and they're putting it all under a creative commons license. And

180
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,720
in addition to that, they've got some 2D drawings of the mainboard so that you can get the exact

181
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:26,120
dimensions and they've released two 3D printable reference designs with the hope that the community

182
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,900
starts creating cases and accessories to house the mainboard. You could actually see like

183
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:38,880
a Raspberry Pi style case for a framework laptop mainboard, giving those of us who self-host

184
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,140
or maybe you just need a small headless machine, a low cost, low power, easy to repair, easy

185
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:50,020
to upgrade headless x86 system.

186
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:57,400
Maybe I can finally get you off that Pi habit. Maybe. But speaking of pricing, there are

187
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:04,340
three main options and price points here. It starts at $399 that's in USD and that gets

188
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:15,560
you a i5 11th Gen Intel, $549 for the base i7 mainboard and $799 for the i7-1185G7 board

189
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,440
if you want to get fancy. Then of course, add whatever memory and storage your use case

190
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
requires.

191
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,660
Yeah, and those are introductory prices too. So these prices will likely go up at some

192
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,400
point in the near future. And that is sort of the killer for the casual play around with

193
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,440
a little computer and learn Linux user. But it still doesn't necessarily put it out of

194
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,720
the price range of an enthusiast necessarily.

195
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,360
Yeah, and you know, that's obviously one use case here folks who like assembling hardware

196
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,480
who like building their own systems and now have a new modular sort of base that they

197
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,020
can build from. I get that. It also makes me wonder though, you know, with this being

198
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:59,120
so out in the open, is some of this research, some of this, you know, the hard work that

199
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,880
the framework team have done here, could any of it be used by other vendors looking to

200
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,960
maybe build off or build similar products?

201
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,080
Hmm, right. Like this is almost like a base platform. And you could take this main board

202
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,720
and you could put it in a whole different chassis or something like that. And maybe

203
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,720
you could see other vendors create products around this. I wonder, you know, you could

204
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,960
see it. I think clearly the major use case, which we haven't even really mentioned yet,

205
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,320
but is the obvious primary use case for this and these, all these standalone main boards

206
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,480
is for framework laptop owners that either need to do a replacement or maybe, maybe they

207
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,840
bought like a low end i5 model a year ago. And maybe in a year or two, they want to pop

208
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,400
in a high end i7 model and essentially get an entirely new PC.

209
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:54,000
It's a whole new era of laptops, or at least maybe if things like this continue to go well,

210
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,280
we'll see. For now, the framework folks are also giving away 100 of the i5 main boards.

211
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,520
But you do need to live in an area that they currently shipped to. And you have to apply

212
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,160
via a special form. But don't worry, we'll have that linked in the notes.

213
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,000
Indeed, that's pretty cool. The notes are always at linuxactionshow.com slash episode

214
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,300
number. So for this episode, it is linuxactionnews.com slash 238. But we'll keep an eye on all these

215
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:29,080
stories and so be sure you go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe. So that way you can get updates

216
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,520
