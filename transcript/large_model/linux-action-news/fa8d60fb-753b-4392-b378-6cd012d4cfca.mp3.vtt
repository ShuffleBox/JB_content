00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 134, recorded on December 1st, 2019.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm Chris.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
And I'm Joe.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Hello, Joe.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
It's good to be connected with you.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.200
And we start this week with the contract for the web officially launching.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.860
Yeah, this was on the mainstream news here in the UK.

00:19.860 --> 00:23.680
And Tim Berners-Lee has been working on this since at least the summer.

00:23.680 --> 00:29.080
We talked about it on Linux Action News 117 back in August.

00:29.080 --> 00:31.120
But now it's officially launched.

00:31.120 --> 00:35.920
And it's got the website, and it's got various companies and governments signed up to it.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.040
And it's going to save the web.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.080
We're going to not have a digital dystopia.

00:39.080 --> 00:43.760
Yeah, this contract, which has been worked on by over 80 organizations for, really, I

00:43.760 --> 00:48.640
think more than a year total, outlines nine central principles to safeguard the web.

00:48.640 --> 00:51.580
Three each for governments, companies, and individuals.

00:51.580 --> 00:55.760
This document was published by Berners-Lee's Web Foundation, has the backing of more than

00:55.760 --> 01:01.960
150 organizations, Microsoft, Twitter, and Google, and Facebook are on that list, as

01:01.960 --> 01:04.720
well as the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

01:04.720 --> 01:08.040
At the time of this episode, notably, Amazon's not on that list.

01:08.040 --> 01:10.120
Yeah, and also Mozilla is not on the list.

01:10.120 --> 01:13.840
And they put up a brief blog post about why.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.000
And they pretty much say it's because there's no accountability.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.200
And this thing's pretty much toothless.

01:19.200 --> 01:22.440
They are broadly positive about it and say they support it.

01:22.440 --> 01:27.080
But they say there's no point signing it until there's some accountability there.

01:27.080 --> 01:30.920
I think they have very tactfully put what is a major concern.

01:30.920 --> 01:34.680
They write, we've decided not to sign the contract, but would consider doing so if stronger

01:34.680 --> 01:37.560
accountability measures are added.

01:37.560 --> 01:43.440
That's my problem with it, is the W3C, which Tim Berners-Lee is the director of, has really

01:43.440 --> 01:49.640
kind of shown us how the exact corporations that are signed on to this document have co-opted

01:49.640 --> 01:53.680
it to implement things like DRM in the browser.

01:53.680 --> 01:58.480
Tim Berners-Lee really hasn't, unfortunately, been a very good steward of that.

01:58.480 --> 02:02.760
And so now I have very little confidence in this contract that's being signed by the very

02:02.760 --> 02:04.480
same influencers.

02:04.480 --> 02:09.040
And when there's no particular accountability clauses in here, other than you just lose

02:09.040 --> 02:14.020
membership, so you can't put a badge on your website, I don't really understand what the

02:14.020 --> 02:19.940
mechanism is to keep things in check, to actually go for all of these privacy goals and other

02:19.940 --> 02:21.080
such things.

02:21.080 --> 02:24.680
And I hate to say something like that about him, because I know he's made a very significant

02:24.680 --> 02:28.280
contribution to the World Wide Web.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.120
But it seems like the wolves are in the henhouse on this one.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.720
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

02:33.720 --> 02:38.800
What triggered me as a pedant is the fact that they kind of interchange web and internet

02:38.800 --> 02:44.100
as if they're synonymous, which to a lot of people they are, but it just always annoys

02:44.100 --> 02:46.400
me when people get those two confused.

02:46.400 --> 02:51.040
And the only real assurance we have here that the tech giants, as he puts them, he calls

02:51.040 --> 02:54.360
them tech giants, is that they are committed to action.

02:54.360 --> 02:59.160
That's our reassurance that they won't influence this thing, such as they have with the W3C.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.800
I just find this whole thing kind of flabbergasting.

03:01.800 --> 03:06.880
It seems like legacy making, and at least an attempt at it.

03:06.880 --> 03:09.720
I don't see what action is going to result of this that's actually going to improve the

03:09.720 --> 03:10.720
situation on the web.

03:10.720 --> 03:12.760
I completely agree with Mozilla on this one.

03:12.760 --> 03:16.520
Well, it might be a good basis from which they can add accountability.

03:16.520 --> 03:17.520
I don't know.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.400
Maybe that's clutching at straws for this.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.040
But the principle, too, for the governments, keep all of the internet available all of

03:23.040 --> 03:24.200
the time.

03:24.200 --> 03:28.900
If that actually happened, that would be good, because right now, if I go to certain sites

03:28.900 --> 03:34.480
like the Pirate Bay or whatever, it's blocked by my ISP, by order of my government.

03:34.480 --> 03:38.400
So the UK government literally could not sign up to this, I don't think.

03:38.400 --> 03:45.780
And I think you might recall the EFF left the W3C after they advocated for the inclusion

03:45.780 --> 03:53.520
of DRM in web standards, because in the EFF's view, that made the web less accessible.

03:53.520 --> 03:58.760
So you could argue his existing organization has already been directly involved in making

03:58.760 --> 04:02.000
the web less accessible and making information available to fewer people.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Well, you could argue that.

04:03.000 --> 04:06.800
But at the time, I was broadly in favor of adding it as a standard, rather than just

04:06.800 --> 04:10.080
having every company just create their own standard.

04:10.080 --> 04:14.060
Yeah, I don't necessarily mean to reopen the debate, because there are advantages.

04:14.060 --> 04:17.000
But I do see where the EFF was coming from.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.600
They're the ones that left the W3C.

04:19.600 --> 04:22.880
And so I can completely understand their point.

04:22.880 --> 04:23.880
You're right, though.

04:23.880 --> 04:28.660
I do think what you were saying earlier is that there is some positive side effects to

04:28.660 --> 04:32.180
having an aspirational framework in which we should work towards.

04:32.180 --> 04:36.180
But it also could just be used as a marketing badge to say, you know, you support user rights

04:36.180 --> 04:41.060
and user privacy, and you can tell because I'm a part of this club, with no actual changes

04:41.060 --> 04:42.060
happening.

04:42.060 --> 04:43.060
I don't know.

04:43.060 --> 04:44.200
I guess I'm being a little pessimistic on this one.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.500
But it just seems like the ship has sailed.

04:46.500 --> 04:51.820
When I mentioned Mozilla, they've published their annual State of Mozilla report for 2018.

04:51.820 --> 04:55.000
And they are really emphasizing the privacy stuff that they've been doing.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.520
Yeah, you might wonder why they report for 2018 at the end of 2019.

04:59.520 --> 05:01.480
Well, of course, that's how these things work.

05:01.480 --> 05:06.560
Really, this report release is timed to coincide with when they submit their Mozilla nonprofit

05:06.560 --> 05:08.960
tax filing for the previous calendar year.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.040
So they time these things to come together.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.720
They really do, Joe.

05:12.720 --> 05:18.180
They really do focus on their efforts in privacy, and I'd say also in social change.

05:18.180 --> 05:24.880
And they highlight as well, like their efforts to try to speak and advocate to legislation,

05:24.880 --> 05:27.960
which surprised me that they kind of hit on that so hard.

05:27.960 --> 05:29.920
Very little in there about the browser.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.960
Yeah.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.960
As it is often, they really like to highlight what makes them different.

05:34.960 --> 05:40.280
And I think this line in here is a key thing to understand and fully appreciate about Mozilla.

05:40.280 --> 05:43.800
And we'll have a link to this annual report, by the way, in the notes.

05:43.800 --> 05:49.160
They say, we measure our success not only by the adoption of our products, but also

05:49.160 --> 05:55.600
by our ability to increase the control people have in their online lives, our impact on

05:55.600 --> 06:01.040
the internet, our contribution to standards, and how we work to protect the overall health

06:01.040 --> 06:02.040
of the web.

06:02.040 --> 06:07.280
Now, I don't know how they measure and get data metrics on any of those particulars,

06:07.280 --> 06:11.380
but I think that really speaks volumes about them as an organization.

06:11.380 --> 06:12.840
It's much more than a browser now.

06:12.840 --> 06:17.600
Yeah, it does sound a bit ethereal, but they have launched some other products and services

06:17.600 --> 06:19.160
over the last year or so.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.160
Indeed.

06:20.160 --> 06:24.960
And would you really, really want to see the Mozilla folks all focused on profit and nothing

06:24.960 --> 06:25.960
else?

06:25.960 --> 06:28.120
I think that'd make us all just a bit uncomfortable.

06:28.120 --> 06:32.040
And it is a really wide umbrella when you define it like that.

06:32.040 --> 06:39.240
It's from everything from VPN services to helping people shop for products that don't

06:39.240 --> 06:40.600
spy on you as much.

06:40.600 --> 06:47.480
It's a weird wide spectrum, but I guess it kind of makes sense if you want some authority

06:47.480 --> 06:50.000
you can trust and Mozilla says, hey, that's us.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Yeah.

06:51.000 --> 06:56.440
They've ramped up their privacy not included, be smart, shop safe, gift giving guide for

06:56.440 --> 06:57.440
this year.

06:57.440 --> 06:58.440
Yeah.

06:58.440 --> 07:04.020
Over on the foundation.mozilla.org site, they've set up a shopping browser that lets you filter

07:04.020 --> 07:10.280
a bunch of products with large pictures on their creepiness factor so you can have something

07:10.280 --> 07:15.280
that's fairly creepy or not creepy at all and the likelihood you would buy it and if

07:15.280 --> 07:18.320
it meets their minimum security standards.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.320
More on that in a moment.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.920
And what you get is a product listing from various vendors and they have everything on

07:22.920 --> 07:25.760
here from Sonos products.

07:25.760 --> 07:32.760
Like they have one here, the, the Ikea Sonos speaker and they have like witty little summaries.

07:32.760 --> 07:37.240
They've rewritten the product summaries, which is kind of odd, but also fun.

07:37.240 --> 07:40.520
Like they're one here, a Sonos speaker with Ikea design.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.520
That's all.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.380
That's the blurb or, or like they have one for the Apple TV.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.140
They recommend that as a less creepy set top box.

07:47.140 --> 07:52.960
If money's no object, the Apple TV and like, well actually Apple TV is not much more expensive

07:52.960 --> 07:53.960
than Nvidia shield.

07:53.960 --> 07:54.960
Like it's, I don't know.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.800
It's kind of funny like their takes on it and they have the Apple watch on here.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.160
You ever notice the Apple watch only becomes a watch if you jiggle your wrist or tap its

08:02.160 --> 08:03.160
face.

08:03.160 --> 08:04.160
Some watch, huh?

08:04.160 --> 08:08.800
Well, the 2019 upgrade to the new Apple watch five fixes all of that.

08:08.800 --> 08:14.180
Like they're, they're like, they're copy editors over here and there's products on here I wouldn't

08:14.180 --> 08:21.000
expect like the nest outdoor security camera, a Google nest security camera that is literally

08:21.000 --> 08:25.080
streaming video 24 seven to Google's data centers.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.080
They don't mind it.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.780
It meets their minimum security standards.

08:27.780 --> 08:33.620
Of course it's had a lot of votes and 58% of the people said they would not buy it,

08:33.620 --> 08:39.280
but it's on here and it has all the stars.

08:39.280 --> 08:43.920
I guess if it depends on what your standards are, if the security standard is, it uses

08:43.920 --> 08:50.000
encryption between your home and their data center and it does updates and it supports

08:50.000 --> 08:55.560
passwords and it self updates if there's a vulnerability, then yes, I suppose that is

08:55.560 --> 09:00.200
a good metric to judge by, but I would like to know what are they doing with this video?

09:00.200 --> 09:04.880
Like when you, when it comes to smart devices, they need to go a layer deeper.

09:04.880 --> 09:10.200
Like they recommend the switch, but they don't tell you how Nintendo online is tracking you.

09:10.200 --> 09:14.000
They're not telling you what metrics Nintendo's collecting and I'm not saying they have to

09:14.000 --> 09:16.880
know these things, but that would be real value.

09:16.880 --> 09:21.120
Instead of witty rewrites of product descriptions that these companies have probably worked

09:21.120 --> 09:26.080
very hard on, I would way rather they spend some money getting statements and quotes from

09:26.080 --> 09:27.080
these companies.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.160
That would be a tremendous value.

09:28.160 --> 09:33.840
Yeah, it would be, but I think what they've done does have value showing you that there

09:33.840 --> 09:38.440
are certain products out there that are just never going to get updates and not using proper

09:38.440 --> 09:42.680
encrypted connections back to the data center because most people don't care about their

09:42.680 --> 09:45.480
data or don't necessarily think about it.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.640
So I suppose, yeah, it would be good if they flagged up the fact that these things were

09:48.640 --> 09:55.600
hoovering up data, but at least they're kind of excluding really, really dodgy IoT devices.

09:55.600 --> 09:59.880
Yeah, I can't disagree with that and I think the one that really stood out to me as really

09:59.880 --> 10:04.160
adding some value is you can go look up the ring video doorbell products from their different

10:04.160 --> 10:08.320
types of cameras they have and they're pretty straightforward.

10:08.320 --> 10:12.000
There's both positive things to these and there's negatives and one of the negatives

10:12.000 --> 10:16.280
they point out is just beware, these doorbells do have some potential privacy vulnerabilities.

10:16.280 --> 10:21.400
That's how they're referring to them as vulnerabilities that could let someone go big brother on you

10:21.400 --> 10:22.680
in your home.

10:22.680 --> 10:27.580
They also mentioned that they had a hard time figuring out the exact information around

10:27.580 --> 10:32.160
what kind of encryption it uses and they note that in September 2019, security reachers

10:32.160 --> 10:34.120
discovered a vulnerability.

10:34.120 --> 10:38.080
So there does seem to be real value added to some of these, especially for people who

10:38.080 --> 10:42.640
don't follow the tech news very close, but they've heard of some of these product names

10:42.640 --> 10:44.900
and they decided they want to pick a few of these up.

10:44.900 --> 10:47.120
This could help eliminate a couple off that list.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.480
Yeah, and it might only have two stars, but now I've learned about this, I'm definitely

10:50.480 --> 10:51.480
going to get it.

10:51.480 --> 10:57.000
It's a $500 Wi-Fi enabled automatic self-cleaning litter box.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.760
I'm getting it for my foster cats.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.080
Right the Litter Robot 3, is that the one you're looking at?

11:01.080 --> 11:02.080
Yeah.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.080
I saw that.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.880
I thought of you when I saw that one.

11:04.880 --> 11:05.880
Now what's the problem?

11:05.880 --> 11:07.000
What don't they like about it?

11:07.000 --> 11:10.480
Looks like it doesn't support strong passwords and then it's not clear if they have a formal

11:10.480 --> 11:11.480
bug bounty program.

11:11.480 --> 11:12.480
Yeah.

11:12.480 --> 11:17.240
No privacy policy as well, although it does get security updates and it does use encryption.

11:17.240 --> 11:19.880
So that's why it gets two stars.

11:19.880 --> 11:20.880
I like this.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.120
They say occasionally it has third party professionals perform security audits.

11:24.120 --> 11:29.200
So there's clearly been some real work done to look into these things.

11:29.200 --> 11:32.560
Wouldn't it be incredible if they had comments from the companies on here?

11:32.560 --> 11:36.960
I think that would be next level, not necessarily allow them to respond to everything, but

11:36.960 --> 11:41.240
maybe for some things, like what's the Nest video storage policy after a year?

11:41.240 --> 11:44.840
Just get some information from Google's Nest division.

11:44.840 --> 11:49.000
Those kinds of things would, I feel like empower somebody like myself who I already know these

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
things.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
I already know it's using SSL.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.320
I already know that Ring can share footage with the police, that they can request that.

11:53.320 --> 11:58.060
I already know these things, but the things I can't as a regular consumer get access to,

11:58.060 --> 12:00.120
they might be able to get comment on.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.120
Bad news though, I'm afraid.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.600
When I told my wife that we should get it, she replied with two words that I can't say

12:04.600 --> 12:05.600
on air.

12:05.600 --> 12:11.560
Anything that makes the flat smell better seems like a net positive increase in quality

12:11.560 --> 12:12.560
of life.

12:12.560 --> 12:13.560
Yeah, exactly.

12:13.560 --> 12:14.560
I'll sell it to her that way.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.360
You know what you should have done, Joe?

12:16.360 --> 12:17.640
Christmas gift for the cat.

12:17.640 --> 12:18.640
Never even brought it up.

12:18.640 --> 12:19.640
It's the holidays.

12:19.640 --> 12:20.640
Good thinking.

12:20.640 --> 12:25.920
Now you know to look for the next Black Friday sale though.

12:25.920 --> 12:32.600
Well, by this time next year, most IoT devices will probably be using Alexa voice service

12:32.600 --> 12:35.840
integration for AWS IoT Core.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.220
You said the trigger word.

12:37.220 --> 12:38.920
We apologize.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.480
This might happen over the next couple of minutes for this story.

12:42.480 --> 12:47.200
You might be wondering why we're covering this because on the surface here, it may seem

12:47.200 --> 12:50.920
like not a Linux story, but that's actually what's so neat about this.

12:50.920 --> 12:58.700
This is not only going to run on Linux, but this is going to mean a whole new level of

12:58.700 --> 13:05.360
Echo devices built into things from washing machines to light switches to microwaves because

13:05.360 --> 13:14.280
they're putting out a nearly DIY complete kit that you can use for development purposes.

13:14.280 --> 13:21.640
And then they've created a secure way to tunnel MQTT messages back up to the AWS servers.

13:21.640 --> 13:25.880
Now self-hosted listeners will recognize that's a big deal.

13:25.880 --> 13:30.520
They're going all in on MQTT with this, and they write on their website, devices will

13:30.520 --> 13:35.480
communicate with AVS, that's the, we won't say her name, voice service, over a single

13:35.480 --> 13:42.800
secure MQTT connection to AWS IoT Core, and it connects with your account, it uses a key

13:42.800 --> 13:49.000
exchange system, and it allows their cloud service that you deploy to subscribe to certain

13:49.000 --> 13:53.120
topics on each one of these IoT devices, like take a smart plug.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.960
Is it on?

13:54.960 --> 13:56.320
What's the current draw?

13:56.320 --> 13:58.080
How long has it been running?

13:58.080 --> 14:02.960
These are topics that the service can subscribe to and get updates on when the device provides

14:02.960 --> 14:08.440
them, and then it stores them at the AWS cloud infrastructure instead of those things having

14:08.440 --> 14:09.440
to remain on device.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.960
So they can be pretty low-end devices.

14:11.960 --> 14:16.200
You pair that up with what are like these little platforms, everything with boxes with

14:16.200 --> 14:22.400
screens to crazy microphone array hardware boxes that are just really bare bones dev

14:22.400 --> 14:29.720
kits, and it's going to mean systems that need less than a megabyte of RAM and have

14:29.720 --> 14:36.200
a really low-end ARM Cortex M class CPU can now do echo services.

14:36.200 --> 14:42.200
Yeah, it used to be that devices needed 50 megabytes or more of memory and run a proper

14:42.200 --> 14:47.440
full-blown operating system like Linux or Android, whereas now it's going to be just

14:47.440 --> 14:54.640
real bare bones, very cheap devices, and all of that processing is going to happen on AWS,

14:54.640 --> 14:58.880
and that's the genius of this because Amazon wants to win the voice assistant war, and

14:58.880 --> 15:02.340
they also want to drive companies and people to AWS.

15:02.340 --> 15:07.760
It's kind of a double win for them, and if these companies making light switches or dishwashers

15:07.760 --> 15:13.640
or whatever use this tech, which seems very likely to me because they're lowering that

15:13.640 --> 15:19.800
barrier of entry now, it's going to mean that the echo devices and the word that you don't

15:19.800 --> 15:24.880
want me to say becomes ubiquitous, and it's all going through AWS, and if you look at

15:24.880 --> 15:27.720
the pricing for it, it's the typical cloud pricing.

15:27.720 --> 15:32.040
It's just a little bit for this, a little bit for that, but it soon adds up, and if

15:32.040 --> 15:38.260
you're shipping hundreds of thousands of dishwashers or washing machines or whatever, you're going

15:38.260 --> 15:42.320
to end up spending a lot of money on AWS, and Amazon gets to cash in.

15:42.320 --> 15:43.920
Yeah.

15:43.920 --> 15:47.920
You joke about the washing machine situation, but I actually think it's going to happen.

15:47.920 --> 15:52.440
Imagine a scenario where the latest Whirlpool or Samsung, maybe this is already a thing,

15:52.440 --> 15:56.060
I haven't shopped for a washing machine in a while, they want to have integration with

15:56.060 --> 16:01.040
cloud services, so that way you could just check in on if your load is done washing yet.

16:01.040 --> 16:04.440
Commercial washer and dryer outfits have this all over the states now.

16:04.440 --> 16:07.160
You start a load, you can check the status on your phone, and you get a notification

16:07.160 --> 16:08.160
when it's done.

16:08.160 --> 16:12.400
Consumers are going to want that, and even the most basic washer and dryers in a few

16:12.400 --> 16:13.400
years.

16:13.400 --> 16:17.840
It sounds crazy, but you know it will happen, and so Amazon creating these kits that when

16:17.840 --> 16:21.040
you buy one of these kits, you go through them, it comes with out-of-box connectivity

16:21.040 --> 16:23.040
to AWS IoT Core.

16:23.040 --> 16:27.320
It's already qualified and ready to go for their audio algorithms for far field voice

16:27.320 --> 16:28.320
pickup.

16:28.320 --> 16:35.320
It supports their algorithms for echo cancellation and the A-word, wake word system, all already

16:35.320 --> 16:39.420
set up and ready to connect back to their IoT Core, and you can get it for super cheap,

16:39.420 --> 16:41.680
and you can scale that way, way up.

16:41.680 --> 16:47.720
You touched on it, Joe, but having had some real hands-on experience with the Echo products

16:47.720 --> 16:51.920
and watched how they've developed over the last few years, nobody is playing the game

16:51.920 --> 16:54.160
as seriously as Amazon is.

16:54.160 --> 17:00.940
The Nest line of products and the HomePod are both perfectly great for their own reasons,

17:00.940 --> 17:06.900
if you're into those kinds of things, but nobody is bringing the fight like the Echoes.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.220
There's way more variations of products.

17:09.220 --> 17:11.240
They update them on a routine basis.

17:11.240 --> 17:15.340
They have really kind of moonshot products like the ring coming soon that is an actual

17:15.340 --> 17:21.840
ring on your finger, and on top of that, it's constantly asking me for information as like

17:21.840 --> 17:26.900
a, I don't know how to put it, like a self-learning mechanism.

17:26.900 --> 17:30.640
One of the things that the Google products have historically been good at is random knowledge.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.060
You can ask it something and it'll pull up a knowledge card.

17:34.060 --> 17:37.680
They're solving that now on the Echo platform by sourcing things from different places like

17:37.680 --> 17:42.520
Wolfram Alpha and Wikipedia, and there's a system in there where it judges if it's the

17:42.520 --> 17:47.040
right time to ask me, and it says, by the way, was that the information you were looking

17:47.040 --> 17:48.040
for?

17:48.040 --> 17:52.560
And I can give it self-correcting information every now and then, and it gets better and

17:52.560 --> 17:53.560
better.

17:53.560 --> 17:58.960
Plus, they roll out new features and celebrity integrations and different size screens and

17:58.960 --> 18:03.500
all of these fancy products that show they are so much more serious about this.

18:03.500 --> 18:09.520
But when I saw that they were embracing MQTT and they were doing it this way over the internet,

18:09.520 --> 18:13.160
my mind really started racing where this could go in the future.

18:13.160 --> 18:17.180
On the Self-Hosted podcast, we talk about the Tasmota firmware, which you can re-flash

18:17.180 --> 18:23.440
smart devices with this open source firmware, and it's all about using MQTT to communicate

18:23.440 --> 18:25.580
back to your home system.

18:25.580 --> 18:30.600
It's something that the open source community has embraced because back in 2010, it went

18:30.600 --> 18:31.600
royalty-free.

18:31.600 --> 18:36.440
It's been around since the late 90s, and in 2010, the floodgates opened, and we've seen

18:36.440 --> 18:41.160
some really cool implementations of different uses of MQTT.

18:41.160 --> 18:47.160
So there's a lot of products out there that you can re-flash and use MQTT, or cool projects

18:47.160 --> 18:51.320
that use it already, and I could see how they could expand this to include and support all

18:51.320 --> 18:52.320
of those, too.

18:52.320 --> 18:54.760
Well, so you think that's a possibility then, you don't think they're going to be locked

18:54.760 --> 18:55.760
down?

18:55.760 --> 18:56.760
It's hard to say.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.760
I mean, they could.

18:57.760 --> 18:58.760
That's the thing.

18:58.760 --> 18:59.760
That's the beauty of it.

18:59.760 --> 19:03.680
If they really wanted to take over and let you really integrate all kinds of devices

19:03.680 --> 19:09.120
into their AWS IoT platform with some tech switches they flip, they could enable that.

19:09.120 --> 19:13.520
And they may never, but they're positioned to if they feel like it's necessary, it seems.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.800
Well, I mentioned the word dystopia earlier.

19:15.800 --> 19:19.720
This is what it feels like to me, not being someone who uses any of these devices.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.800
I would never have an Echo in my house.

19:22.800 --> 19:23.800
Thank you very much.

19:23.800 --> 19:28.480
Yeah, I think it's going to be like, I suspect, I think it's going to be like how you just

19:28.480 --> 19:32.680
really can't buy non-smart TVs anymore, they're all smart TVs now.

19:32.680 --> 19:37.360
I suspect it's sort of like smartifying everything, it's the smartification of everything.

19:37.360 --> 19:41.880
And it's really obnoxious, because you're right, there's clear privacy implications.

19:41.880 --> 19:45.960
We do have a podcast that covers these types of things, including how you can block these

19:45.960 --> 19:48.840
types of things at the DNS level, which is what I do at my house.

19:48.840 --> 19:52.740
I experiment with these things on and off, and when I'm done, I actually just leave the

19:52.740 --> 19:55.600
devices in, but I just block the functionality at the DNS level.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.600
And it works really well.

19:56.600 --> 20:00.840
Well, like I always say, I'll get into this when I can run it completely on my LAN and

20:00.840 --> 20:04.880
not have to connect to any sort of cloud services, which seems like it's getting closer, but

20:04.880 --> 20:06.000
we're not quite there yet.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
Yeah, not yet.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.520
But I think it will be sooner than later.

20:08.520 --> 20:11.680
I think there'll be a couple of, oh, maybe I should save this for a prediction.

20:11.680 --> 20:12.680
Hmm.

20:12.680 --> 20:13.680
I think I will, Joe.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.740
I think I'm going to save it for a predictions episode.

20:16.740 --> 20:20.600
Maybe you should predict that someone will crack these devices using Kali Linux.

20:20.600 --> 20:24.280
Hey, yeah, especially the new release, which looks great.

20:24.280 --> 20:30.160
Kali 2019.4 is out with lots of new fancy features, but I think there's one main feature

20:30.160 --> 20:34.200
that has nothing to do with vulnerability assessments or exploitation that you care

20:34.200 --> 20:35.200
about.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.640
Yeah, they've switched to XFCE by default.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.520
Very sensible idea.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.920
And it's a pretty slick looking XFCE too.

20:41.920 --> 20:43.200
Yeah, it's pretty nice.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.960
It's a little bit too dark for my taste.

20:44.960 --> 20:49.720
I know you're all in on dark mode, but for me, it's a little bit hard to read sometimes.

20:49.720 --> 20:52.720
I knew you were going to say that.

20:52.720 --> 20:56.240
But one cool feature of it is Kali undercover.

20:56.240 --> 21:00.840
And so you just type Kali-undercover in the terminal and it just instantly switches to

21:00.840 --> 21:02.460
look like Windows 10.

21:02.460 --> 21:06.960
So if you're out in public somewhere and you don't want people to know that you are up

21:06.960 --> 21:11.760
to whatever it is you're up to with Kali Linux, it looks like Windows 10 and no one will bat

21:11.760 --> 21:12.760
an eyelid.

21:12.760 --> 21:13.760
Okay.

21:13.760 --> 21:14.760
All right.

21:14.760 --> 21:16.560
But be honest, did you really think it looked like Windows 10?

21:16.560 --> 21:22.120
I think it looked enough like it to not attract attention.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.120
From like across the room.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.120
Oh, yeah.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.120
And that's all it needs to do, right?

21:25.120 --> 21:26.120
Yeah.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.120
Okay.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.120
All right.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.120
Yeah, I'll give it that.

21:29.120 --> 21:31.080
That'd be my level of passes the sniff test there.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.080
I wouldn't use it though.

21:32.080 --> 21:33.840
I liked that GTK theme.

21:33.840 --> 21:37.400
I thought it was great and they did have a light version of it too if you wanted to go

21:37.400 --> 21:38.400
back.

21:38.400 --> 21:42.040
There's a couple of things about this release that really impressed me.

21:42.040 --> 21:47.520
I think it's been maybe a couple of years since I've given Kali a go.

21:47.520 --> 21:49.180
Man they've done a lot with this thing.

21:49.180 --> 21:54.000
So we've talked about the way it looks, but what's really remarkable in my opinion is

21:54.000 --> 21:58.040
their commitment to documentation everywhere throughout the menu.

21:58.040 --> 22:03.520
It's very easy to get information about things you could try doing, ways to learn, even ways

22:03.520 --> 22:05.360
to get professional training.

22:05.360 --> 22:10.120
And when you launch a command line tool, it opens up in the shell with the TAC TAC help

22:10.120 --> 22:11.120
already set.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.700
You get all the information that that command can do.

22:13.700 --> 22:14.920
You get what I mean by that.

22:14.920 --> 22:19.000
It's really helpful because you get all of the flags, all the information right there

22:19.000 --> 22:21.100
and it makes it approachable.

22:21.100 --> 22:25.680
But on top of that, they've made it super simple to set persistent USB mode because

22:25.680 --> 22:27.560
it's right in the grub menu.

22:27.560 --> 22:32.120
So people that aren't necessarily Linux pros but are trying to learn a Linux tool so that

22:32.120 --> 22:37.360
way they can improve their network security have really easy, obvious options.

22:37.360 --> 22:42.600
And then last but not least, they've made a commitment to moving their documentation

22:42.600 --> 22:48.120
to Markdown and putting it up on GitHub so people can make pull requests and merge requests.

22:48.120 --> 22:51.040
And it's approachable being in Markdown that just about anybody except for Joe could write

22:51.040 --> 22:52.040
it.

22:52.040 --> 22:55.480
That's kind of say, yeah, I was like Markdown.

22:55.480 --> 22:59.000
It's interesting that they've added PowerShell to it, which is not something I'm going to

22:59.000 --> 23:04.280
use, but I think potentially a lot of Windows users coming over may be used to using.

23:04.280 --> 23:05.960
Yeah, I think that's pretty neat.

23:05.960 --> 23:11.340
PowerShell because honestly, it's a multi-operating system world right now and to be able to go

23:11.340 --> 23:16.080
after Windows boxes and Linux boxes from one OS is, well, it's a feature.

23:16.080 --> 23:18.840
So there's one other really kind of large headlining feature here that we haven't touched

23:18.840 --> 23:19.840
on.

23:19.840 --> 23:22.680
Again, I think it's important to mention that Kali offers so much more than these headline

23:22.680 --> 23:24.760
features, but this is pretty neat.

23:24.760 --> 23:29.680
It's called NetHunter Kex and it's a full Kali desktop on your Android phone.

23:29.680 --> 23:35.000
So in a nutshell, it allows you to attach your Android device to an HDMI output along

23:35.000 --> 23:40.480
with a Bluetooth keyboard and a mouse and you get full, as they put it, no compromise

23:40.480 --> 23:42.800
Kali desktop on an Android phone.

23:42.800 --> 23:46.760
Of course, it's up on an HDMI screen, but the idea could be maybe you've got a Raspberry

23:46.760 --> 23:52.000
Pi device or a laptop or a VM that's headless and then you can just sit down, plug an Android

23:52.000 --> 23:54.960
device in and get full access to it using this NetHunter.

23:54.960 --> 23:58.560
Yeah, that is pretty slick and GNOME users, don't worry.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.160
There is still a GNOME version of it.

24:00.160 --> 24:02.160
It's just XFC by default.

24:02.160 --> 24:03.880
There's also a Marte and Plasma versions.

24:03.880 --> 24:04.880
Oh, really?

24:04.880 --> 24:05.880
Yeah.

24:05.880 --> 24:06.880
Pretty much all the bases are covered.

24:06.880 --> 24:07.880
Yeah.

24:07.880 --> 24:08.880
I didn't even bother checking for those.

24:08.880 --> 24:12.000
That's normally would be part of my overall review, but I would really recommend giving

24:12.000 --> 24:16.680
the XFC version a go because they really strike a balance between decent performance, look

24:16.680 --> 24:18.400
and resources.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.320
This is such a powerful distribution.

24:20.320 --> 24:24.120
This is a real gift and I don't say that lightly.

24:24.120 --> 24:28.160
Having done this professionally back in the day and before Kali existed, but other tools

24:28.160 --> 24:33.680
before it did and it made all the difference because I had one spot to sit down and learn

24:33.680 --> 24:39.680
these things because they also link you to vulnerability databases and scenarios that

24:39.680 --> 24:45.160
you can use to learn that are publicly available that the community posts.

24:45.160 --> 24:49.160
And I've got to dig more into this because they've done so much good work with this distro.

24:49.160 --> 24:52.440
There's other things they've included by default that we can't even touch on because it would

24:52.440 --> 24:53.920
just take the whole episode.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.600
So I think Wes and I will talk about it more in Linux Unplugged this week.

24:56.600 --> 24:59.560
Well, as I always say, I look forward to listening to it three times.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.560
Yes.

25:00.560 --> 25:04.800
Yes, as the editor, I'd say at least three times, probably not to mention if you tune

25:04.800 --> 25:05.800
in live.

25:05.800 --> 25:06.800
Yeah.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.000
Make it an even four.

25:08.000 --> 25:12.800

We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.780
I'm at Chris LAS.

25:22.780 --> 25:24.200
I'm at Joe Rissington.

25:24.200 --> 25:26.920
Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next week.

25:26.920 --> 25:42.920
See you later.
