00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,840
This is episode 107, recorded on May 26th, 2019. I'm Chris.

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,840
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,200
Hello, Joe. Good to be connected with you. We have a packed week, like a whole range

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,400
of news stories. So let's kick things off with a brand new, faster than ever, Firefox

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,400
release.

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:39,200
Yeah, Firefox 67 and Mozilla are very proud of this release, saying that it is the fastest

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,360
ever. And I've been running this for a few days, and I've not noticed it be any slower,

9
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,880
but I can't say I've noticed it be any faster. What about you?

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,240
Oh, that's funny. You know what? I noticed it immediately. I noticed it specifically

11
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,960
in the way that Firefox paints the web pages now. And I did some looking into it, and it

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,380
turns out there's some reason. First of all, they deprioritized the least commonly used

13
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,320
features so they they just did a full review of all of the areas they felt could cause

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,080
delay on delivering that painting effect of the web page. And they went through there

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,440
and they looked at things like delaying the set timeout in order to prioritize scripts

16
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,220
for things you need first, while maybe delaying other components on the website. This looks

17
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:27,200
really great on Amazon or on Twitter or on Instagram where you'll see it will load the

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,200
components necessary for you to navigate and read the page. And then the really complex

19
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,180
little objects that are just sort of add ons. It adds those second and adds the images second

20
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,480
like so that you immediately get the content. And the other thing that's very nice is if

21
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,280
you're in a low memory situation, which Firefox seems to be lower than 400 megabytes of free

22
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,320
RAM, it will now auto suspend unused tabs. It has some sort of timeout. If you haven't

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,440
looked at them for a while, it just puts them to sleep. That's great. I noticed the painting

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,720
stuff but having a whole bunch of tabs open is sometimes a bad habit of mine. So having

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,720
that suspend feature could be very nice.

26
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:12,080
Well, maybe it's because I relatively recently built this fairly fast machine and Firefox

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,520
has just felt fast ever since then. But I don't know, I just don't see it. Now that

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,000
you're talking about that painting thing, I've opened a few tabs and I can kind of see

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,120
it but I don't know, maybe I'm just not observant enough. I think maybe if I went back to the

30
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,160
old version, then I'd suddenly notice it. That's always the way with speed improvements

31
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,840
for things. I can remember putting an SSD in my wife's laptop and said to her, so have

32
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,920
you noticed it's faster? She's like, no, not at all. I said, right, I'm putting your hard

33
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,040
disk back in and then she's like, okay, yes, this is significantly slower.

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,920
Yeah, that's a great way to put it. I think I noticed it more because I was coming from

35
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,560
Chrome as my daily driver and when I saw the Firefox update come down, which I got to say,

36
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,840
both Fedora and Ubuntu updated pretty quickly. When I saw it land, I was like, all right,

37
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,820
I got to give this a go. I noticed it because it's different than how Chrome renders the

38
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,300
webpage and I think I prefer it. Something else they slipped in 67 is what they're calling

39
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:15,680
the world's fastest AV1 decoder. AV1 is a new video decoder by Dave 1D, which is now

40
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,560
enabled by default in Windows, OS 10, and Linux builds of Firefox, both 32-bit and 64-bit.

41
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:32,160
It claims files that are 30% smaller than VP9 WebM codecs and 50% smaller than H.264.

42
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,840
The other cool thing about this is that it's sponsored by the Alliance for Open Media,

43
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,480
which is a joint effort between Videolan, the VLC folks, and FFmpeg, and it's baked

44
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,000
into Firefox 67 now.

45
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,560
Yeah, we talked about AV1, it must be a couple of months ago now, and that is a royalty-free

46
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,140
video codec. It looked like it was going to be a bit of a kind of slow transition over

47
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,100
to it, but thanks to being baked into Firefox, hopefully that's going to really push it forward

48
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,880
and become the standard much sooner.

49
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,540
It's really buried the lead though with the new Firefox 67 release. This is what really

50
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:13,780
matters is there's this new support for smart dark mode. There's this prefers color scheme

51
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,920
media feature now that allows sites to adapt their styles to match the preferences for

52
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,880
the browser. So if you come to a website with dark mode enabled for Firefox, the website

53
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,000
will load a dark version. I think that's so cool, and there is a great dark theme now

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,600
for Firefox, and I'm just really happy because I love dark mode for the web.

55
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,920
You may have predicted that dark mode was going to be the thing for this year.

56
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,240
I know, so this is just wonderful.

57
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,680
Yeah. Well, it does show that they're in tune with what's going on because the whole tech

58
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,520
industry seems to be going over to dark mode.

59
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,800
Hey, it's easy on the eyes, man. It's easy on the eyes. There's one kind of major change

60
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,940
that landed in 67 that is messing with some folks. If you launched Firefox 67 and your

61
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,240
add-ons were gone, your history was gone, all of your customizations were gone, that's

62
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,600
being caused because the browser created a new profile for 67 instead of using your original

63
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,800
one. This isn't a super uncommon problem. Firefox keeps each set of user data in their

64
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:22,360
own profiles, and starting in 67, Mozilla has switched to individual profiles for each

65
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,320
installed version of Firefox.

66
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,640
Yeah, which could be super handy if you've got the beta or nightly or whatever alongside

67
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,240
the standard one and you want to have a separate profile, but it seems that that has caused

68
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,740
issues for quite a number of users.

69
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,840
It is nice because sometimes those nightlies or those betas don't maybe support an extension

70
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,800
or et cetera. There's lots of reasons why you might want to have that. It's a necessary

71
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,880
change, but yeah, it's causing some workflow disruption.

72
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,960
It is possible to rescue your old profile though, so all is not lost here. It's only

73
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,040
a few clicks away, but it still must be very annoying. Thankfully, it hasn't happened to

74
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,760
me, but I've read quite a lot of reports of it happening to people. But yeah, it's a bit

75
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,880
embarrassing, but it's not quite on the scale of the last time people lost all their extensions,

76
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,720
but let's not dwell too much on that, eh?

77
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,800
No, hot off the mirrors in Germany, we have new releases of OpenSUSE, so let's dwell

78
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,920
on that for a moment. A brand new release of 15.1 OpenSUSE Leap.

79
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,320
Yeah, this is OpenSUSE Leap, which is their snapshot version, not to be confused with

80
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,060
Tumbleweed, which is the rolling release. This is much closer to the Enterprise Edition

81
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,120
SLE, as they call it.

82
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,480
And 15.1 really seems to be about pulling in features that just make it a great stable

83
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,240
Linux station. Lots of notes in here about improvements to Yast functionality, and they've

84
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,820
backported the graphics hardware stack in the 4.19 Linux kernel to the kernel that ships

85
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:52,100
in Leap, which is based on 4.12. And that's pretty nice, because that includes improved

86
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:58,200
support for the AMD Vega chipset, now in a stable Enterprise-style distribution.

87
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:04,600
Also in here is GNOME 3.26, and the long-term support version of Plasma 5.12. You can also

88
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:11,260
install XFCE, if you like. And of course, Leap out of the box works with x86-64. But

89
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,640
there's all kinds of now what they call deployment scenarios for physical machines, virtual machines,

90
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,860
and they've got some cloud and container discussion in here as well. And they talk about the community's

91
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,740
work to port it to ARM64 and power architectures.

92
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:29,960
And then last but not least, nice to see a line in here about OpenSUSE for the Raspberry

93
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:36,160
Pi now being simplified into one image that is very customizable. I downloaded it. I have

94
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,520
it on my desktop upstairs right now. I'm going to give it a go here pretty soon. If I have

95
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,080
anything to report, I might share my additional hands-on thoughts in Linux Unplugged this

96
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,040
week. But initially, I want a stable Enterprise-grade workstation perspective. This looks like a

97
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,820
super solid release, and it's nice to see them bring some of those graphics stack stuff

98
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,520
back to their 4.12 kernel. And to see it based around 5.12 Plasma, which I'm running here

99
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,000
in the studio, is a fantastic release of the Plasma desktop. Nice long-term support stack

100
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
there.

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,840
It's interesting that OpenSUSE really is there to try and hook you in, and then they can

102
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,000
upsell you on the Enterprise edition because you can update directly from an OpenSUSE 15.1

103
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,680
release to SUSE Linux Enterprise 15.1. And that update is seamless, supposedly. So they're

104
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,440
quite transparent about that, that this is just to hook you in. And I like that. I like

105
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:35,320
how they're just straightforward about it. This is our community edition, but hey, if

106
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,280
you want to pay us for support, then it's really easy.

107
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,920
Yeah. No pressure. Kick the tires. See it. Drive it. Put it in production. Make sure

108
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:47,560
it's a good fit. And then if you decide that it's valuable enough that you want to upgrade

109
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,320
to a paid support version, well, here's our phone number. I think it's actually a very

110
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,840
clever move. This release comes at a very pivotal time for SUSE. Right now, as we record,

111
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:01,420
OpenSUSE Con 2019 is happening. They're up there tweeting about it right now. But the

112
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:07,200
other significant thing happening around this release is that OpenSUSE is considering changing

113
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,200
their governance model, or at least they're looking at their options.

114
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,120
Yeah, it's very, very early days for this. But they're looking around at the reality

115
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,180
of this situation. SUSE keeps getting bought, doesn't it? And at the moment, they are completely

116
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,520
dependent on the parent company. And things are working absolutely fine at the moment.

117
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:30,120
They're perfectly happy. But who knows what's going to happen next time they get sold, which

118
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,960
does seem inevitable. They are owned by an investment firm at the moment. And maybe that

119
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,800
company isn't going to be necessarily as friendly to the OpenSUSE side of things. And so if

120
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,240
they had more independent governance, then maybe they'd be in a stronger position. And

121
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,280
so that's the discussion that they're having now. And because it's all open source, it's

122
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,160
all out in the open. But I think it's going to be a long time really before anything happens.

123
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,520
We're talking about months at minimum here.

124
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,000
Well, good on them. Then that is exactly when they should be having this conversation. And

125
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,800
also, good on them for how frank this conversation is. And the message seems pretty clear. Today,

126
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,800
as things stand, they're not really an issue. And they're pretty happy with the public commitment

127
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,400
that SUSE has made to OpenSUSE. But there is, like you said, that really kind of honest

128
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,680
underpinning line here that says, it was an equity firm. And they're going to make them

129
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,880
into a valuable purchase again for a reason, to sell them to somebody that's willing to

130
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,400
spend money on them. And what happens then? Does that commitment change at that point?

131
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,480
Because we don't know who the new owners would be. They could be somebody great, or not.

132
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,800
And how does that affect us as a long term project who has commitments we want to make

133
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,520
to our users? I think it's brilliant. They're thinking about that absolutely necessary.

134
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:50,200
And honestly, if I was a daily driver of OpenSUSE, seeing that the team is willing to have this

135
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,920
frank of a conversation around the issue and have it in the public would give me a lot

136
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,820
of comfort to know that their heads in the right space and they're planning for the future.

137
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,440
And they're doing it respectfully too. I think the conversation is respectful. Their timing

138
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,080
is right. And the whole thing is, I think, being done really well. Also credit to Richard

139
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,520
Brown, who seems to be very open to having this conversation and listening to what matters

140
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,320
to these people. And he's not necessarily validating all of the concerns, but he's listening.

141
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,720
And I think that's a big credit to him as well.

142
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,040
Yeah, and thinking about governance structure and making proper plans is something that

143
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,840
a lot of Linux distros could afford to do. Unfortunately, it seems that didn't happen

144
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:34,880
with Antegos. And so that project is shutting down and pretty quickly.

145
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,000
Whoo, boy, this hit me hard. You linked me to this. I think I was just about to go on

146
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,960
air to record last week's Linux Unplugged and this dropped and it was like a ton of

147
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,000
bricks had landed in the studio. I also I have to say I really respect and appreciate

148
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,480
the way they're communicating this while I'm supremely disappointed because I think it

149
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,300
was a really great distribution. They're being forefront. They're not dragging this thing

150
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,280
on for a year. They're not ghosting out. They write, we came to this decision because we

151
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,760
believe that continuing to neglect the project would be a huge disservice to the community.

152
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,080
And they're right. So handling it this way, explaining what's going on and telling them

153
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,380
what the exit strategy is, which they write, soon we will release an update that will remove

154
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,000
the Antegos repos from your system, along with any Antegos specific packages that no

155
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,920
longer serve a purpose due to the project ending.

156
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,880
Yeah. So if you're running Antegos, you're just going to be running vanilla arch. So

157
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,760
you're not completely left out in the cold at all. You're still going to get all your

158
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:40,880
updates and everything, but it is still disappointing to see this happen. Although there is a move

159
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,480
to potentially carry it on under a different name.

160
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,840
That's right. When one project closes a door, another opens a window, Joe. It's called Endeavor.

161
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,160
This is a post over on the Antegos forum. And they write that they're going to continue

162
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,680
on in the spirit of Antegos. And the first stage is to set up a spot for the community

163
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:08,760
to get together. I guess I applaud them. I think if I could go all Pacific Northwest

164
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,560
artist on you for a moment, though, I feel like they should let Antegos go, man. Like

165
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,360
let the art die and go create something new, man. Go create your own thing.

166
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,480
Yeah. Well, we say it's called Endeavor. That's only the code name for now. They do want the

167
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,760
community to help them come up with a new name. And a few things have been tossed around,

168
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,240
but it doesn't look like they've decided yet. But this does feel a little bit like kind

169
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,120
of clutching at straws. And perhaps the people involved in this don't really understand how

170
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,540
much effort is involved with running a distro. It is an enormous amount of effort. And always

171
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,600
people will jump up and say, hey, yeah, I can carry it on. But then when the reality

172
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,960
dawns on them, you do have to wonder whether they will actually follow through with this.

173
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,400
You kind of have to give them the benefit of the doubt at this stage, but I'm not massively

174
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,760
hopeful for it, I'm afraid.

175
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,640
You know, the pragmatist in me says there's a couple of nice things that Antegos brings

176
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,840
to the table. Number one, you have a graphical installer called Cinchy that's actually pretty

177
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,580
legit and they could continue to use that. It's open source. And just really putting

178
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:16,680
that on top of what would otherwise be a fairly vanilla Arch install. That's great. If Endeavor

179
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,280
turns into that, if they can avoid the whole custom repos, custom packages, because that

180
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,600
is actually where Antegos got a little off in the weeds sometimes anyways. So if they

181
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,680
could avoid all of that and continue to use Cinchy just to give people a nice 10 minute

182
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,040
way to install Arch and pick your desktop and be done, I think it's nice. People always

183
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,160
discount these kind of distributions and you always get people saying all the time, and

184
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,960
this has been the number one comment since this news came out is, ah, Arch isn't that

185
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,920
bad, just install it yourself. What people don't appreciate is A, that's true, and B,

186
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,160
it doesn't matter. Straight up doesn't matter. Does not matter at all. There is just a simple

187
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:01,240
barrier to entry where closing that gap, closing that tiny 5 to 10% gap makes all of the difference

188
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,800
in the world. That's why jails have been around for decades, but Docker is a huge deal. They

189
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:12,240
made, they closed that, the 10% difference often makes a significant one. And a graphical

190
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,240
installer that you boot into in a live environment that lets you check a box for ZFS, gives you

191
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,500
forms to fill out all of your users, and then you can choose one of the great open source

192
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,280
desktop environments from a list, and then you hit a couple of buttons and you'll walk

193
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,040
back in 10 minutes and you have a fully up to date, ready to go Arch install. I don't

194
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,960
care who you are, that's convenient and it's that convenience that people want. That's

195
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:41,160
why people buy apps in app stores. It's convenience, it's nice, it's simple. They got other things

196
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,040
to do with their day. That was the gap Anagros filled.

197
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,680
Yeah. And to some extent, Manjaro has filled that as well. And call it a coincidence, but

198
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,460
this week Manjaro tweeted that they've had over a million downloads so far this year.

199
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,360
So that's only just over one quarter's worth, which is pretty impressive.

200
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,520
That is. People love Manjaro. And I'm sure it's a total coincidence since Anagros mentioned

201
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,960
they had 900,000 downloads since 2014. I bet you it's a total coincidence.

202
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:16,200
But there are a couple of other simple ways and scripts and stuff to install Arch. So

203
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:21,560
I don't think we necessarily need Endeavor to continue and actually work out. There are

204
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,560
simple ways to do it. But I don't know, Anagros was just the go to, wasn't it? If you want

205
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,740
Manjaro and the customizations that they have, then you go down that route. But if you want

206
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,600
something more vanilla, then you go for Anticross.

207
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,840
Yeah. And you're right. There's plenty of different ways to install Arch that are very

208
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,520
quick and simple. And that's why I think maybe Endeavor doesn't need to be a thing. When

209
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,480
I put the Pacific Northwest hat on, which is nice, man. It's actually got a wood veneer

210
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,560
front. I'm not kidding. I got a Pacific... It really is cool. It's a ball cap with a

211
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,600
wood front. That's why I feel like just let it go. It was here. The market didn't really

212
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,920
seem to respond super strong. Just let it go. But the pragmatist says, well, that sentry

213
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,240
is nice. But there are a lot of others. I did a look around and I saw a couple, just

214
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,480
within a couple of minutes of searching, and then some extra research was done by the team.

215
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,000
And we found another handful of distributions that are basically vanilla Arch with an easy

216
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,440
to use installer. Some of them are command lines. Some of them are graphical.

217
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,020
Yeah. Maybe they should just let it go. Unlike Google, who will not let go of Google Glass.

218
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,080
We keep thinking that it's going to die, but it seems to just keep coming back.

219
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,200
Maybe there's a good crossover here. You could get flair that says, I'm an Arch user, and

220
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,600
people that have Google Glass could see that flair above your head. You see, there could

221
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:46,040
be a crossover. Just get it out of the way right there when you walk up. Yeah, it's back,

222
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:51,540
Joe. Google is ready to have you purchase Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2 if you're

223
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:57,260
willing to spend $1,000, which is actually a discount from the 1500 the last Enterprise

224
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,960
Edition was. This one has a faster processor, an improved camera. It jumps from, I believe,

225
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,800
five megapixels to now it's at eight megapixels. Still 720p video, but it looks better. And

226
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:15,040
probably the biggest standout difference is you can get it with these Smith Optics safety

227
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:19,160
frames. So it kind of looks like you're supposed to be on a construction site or something.

228
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,520
I think they're telling us who this is targeted at, Joe. We did actually talk about this back

229
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,220
in March on the show, but at the time that was just kind of speculation. Yeah, we saw

230
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:32,360
the rumors and it did seem like back then they were making a straight beeline for business.

231
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:38,480
Yeah. And here we are with the actual reality of it. And sure enough, yeah, it is very much

232
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,680
aimed at enterprise and it's actually slightly higher spec than everyone had thought back

233
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,640
then. Right. So not only does it have those nicer specs, but on the software side, Google

234
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,700
is touting in sort of a big way that this is now quote unquote easier to develop for

235
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,320
because it's now built on Android. I thought the previous versions were, but apparently

236
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,000
it was its own custom OS and they continue. It can now leverage existing APIs as well

237
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:11,560
as, and this is a big one, Android enterprise mobile device management for scaled deployments.

238
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,760
So I think one could pretty easily see how this could be used by different manufacturing

239
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,560
plants, say like a Tesla or some other modern place that's working with technology like

240
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,280
this. You get a fleet of these things and then you use that central management system

241
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:29,240
to flash work specific applications for the work of the day. I actually could see this

242
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:34,060
being useful. It's weird and creepy obviously because it's a Google device strapped to your

243
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:39,640
face that's always connected to the internet. We have to make that disclaimer obviously,

244
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,680
but when they focus on business like this, the use cases become a little more obvious.

245
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:48,120
Yeah, you do have to wonder if they will eventually make that crossover back into the consumer

246
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:54,680
space, but I think that ship has sailed really. I think this is just them completely pivoting

247
00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:01,160
and realizing that there is a market for it where it kind of doesn't matter. Like at work,

248
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,580
everyone's on camera all the time anyway and you're all being watched by bosses and stuff.

249
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,920
So it doesn't really matter that privacy aspect of it. Whereas out and about in the real world,

250
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:16,320
people are just not really going to go for this. So it's kind of weird to see it live

251
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,520
on and I don't know, a thousand dollars, it still seems very expensive for what you're

252
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:28,600
actually getting there. So I don't know how popular it's going to be really. Maybe they

253
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:34,120
can do some bulk deals with enterprises, but I don't know. I think that it's just still

254
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,040
a bit too pricey. That was always my concern with it in the first place. Not even really

255
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:43,480
the privacy stuff. It was just, I'm not spending a thousand dollars or pounds on this thing.

256
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,360
Well, for me, I was always waiting for the Huawei edition to come out, but I guess that

257
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,080
won't be happening now.

258
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,680
Yeah, probably not.

259
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,920
Maybe they'll run KaiOS though. The rate things are going. This might be the third OS.

260
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:02,280
Yeah, it's possible. And this week, KaiOS got another $50 million of funding and announced

261
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,000
that it's hit a hundred million handsets that have been shipped.

262
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,760
Soak that in for a second. A hundred million shipped devices across a hundred countries.

263
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:20,720
And by the way, that new $50 million infusion brings our total fundraising up to $72 million.

264
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,600
You'll recall the last time we talked about them, Google had just invested $22 million

265
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
into the business.

266
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,800
Yeah, yeah. And so this is the continuation of Firefox OS of course. And that again is

267
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,480
something I didn't expect to see live on. But this KaiOS seems to be going from strength

268
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:41,320
to strength. I actually did have a hands on with it on the Nokia, is it the 8110? I can't

269
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:47,920
remember, the Banana, the Matrix phone anyway. And I wasn't really very surprised by it.

270
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:53,360
It was just exactly what I expected, which is like somewhere in between a feature phone

271
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,840
and a smartphone. It had apps to some extent, but didn't have a touchscreen. And so navigation

272
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,960
was really clunky on it, but it was a very cheap device. So I can see the market they're

273
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,080
going for. And that market is not in Europe or the US, it's in developing countries. And

274
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,000
well, obviously it must be doing well.

275
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,520
It's funny how up my alley a phone like this. So first of all, they have like the, the Banana

276
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,760
phone styles, but they also have like the traditional flip phones. I miss having a flip

277
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,320
phone where I could flip it closed, put it in my pocket. And I don't need a ton of stuff.

278
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,520
In fact, in a way I'd like to have a simpler phone, but I wouldn't mind still having navigation.

279
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,240
I wouldn't mind having YouTube on there as well. So it's, I actually, I would probably

280
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,240
consider buying one of these if they sold them here in the West. I think it's also an

281
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,640
interesting thought exercise to just talk about the numbers again, one more time, but

282
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,440
keep the Librem five in mind. Now, when we talk about these numbers, they've shipped

283
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:01,000
to a hundred million devices across a hundred countries. They've raised $72 million in funds

284
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,880
just to do this one thing, just to do this.

285
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,840
And they, they're not even a blip on anyone's radar in, in our circles. I just think we

286
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:17,880
don't even have a appreciation as average users to the scale of the mobile market. I'll

287
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,640
give you another number that's kind of staggering right now. It's estimated that today there

288
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:27,840
are around 1.5 billion feature phone users active in the market. Feature phones still

289
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:34,760
account for almost 25% of all handset shipments in Q3 of last year alone, which works out

290
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:41,200
to be about a $28 billion market opportunity. I think we have a hard time conceptualizing

291
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,680
the size of this market and the scale in which a company must reach in order to even have

292
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:52,640
what would be considered somewhat sustainable success. And when you think about that and

293
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,720
Purism's also building their own operating system, they're building laptops, they're

294
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,240
trying to do hosted services. They're trying to build a phone. They're also trying to free

295
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,580
the firmware on Intel management systems. They're trying to make applications convergent

296
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:12,740
across their custom desktop and their phone OS. Plus they also have to support the devices

297
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,400
they ship at the end of the day, and now the service they've launched. It's a massive undertaking

298
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,060
and the scale of success in which you must reach to even really become sustainable I

299
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,720
think is beyond our comprehension right now, but we're about to learn.

300
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,840
Well, yeah. I mean, imagine KaiOS was just totally independent and not based on Firefox

301
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,960
OS. We probably wouldn't have even heard of it.

302
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,000
No. Or if it hadn't gotten $22 million from Google alone.

303
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Well, yeah.

304
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,760
I mean, it's raised $72 million now. It takes a lot of money to do this and it takes a big

305
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:51,400
team and it takes a lot of deals. It's a fascinating market and I think we have a hard time conceptualizing,

306
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,160
especially when it goes to anything outside the West.

307
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
That's true.

308
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,560
I would have loved to have seen KaiOS or Firefox OS continue on though in these types of handsets.

309
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:05,920
Imagine one of these things, $80 to $100 with a day or two battery life that gives you basic

310
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:11,000
connectivity and functionality. Man, I'd be all over that device. I'd buy that.

311
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,440
Well, you might buy it, but you wouldn't use it very long.

312
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,200
I think I would on the weekends. It'd be like my weekend phone, Joe. I'd be that guy.

313
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,400
I'm telling you, man. I used it for a day or two and it was so frustrating.

314
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,280
Wow. Okay.

315
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:28,520
You don't realize how dependent you are on a proper smartphone until you try and use

316
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,720
one of these. Fair enough, if you live in a country, you don't have much money and this

317
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,760
is all you've got available to you, then it's way better than nothing, but we are very spoiled

318
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,880
by Android phones and iPhones and everything. I'm telling you, you would not enjoy using

319
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,880
it.

320
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,800
Okay, fair point because here's what I just started thinking about was I think I'm romanticizing

321
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:55,160
the good old days of my cell phones because I do the same thing with my computers. Now,

322
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:00,920
in 2019, if the internet goes out, my computer is like freaking worthless. I can poke around

323
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,960
on it for a while, but I can't install software. I can't update my games. I can't really do

324
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,660
anything. It's kind of, without the internet, it's kind of worthless and I imagine that's

325
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,920
kind of what one of those phones would sort of feel like.

326
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Yeah, pretty much.

327
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:18,040
Well, rounding out the news this week is something from GitHub. They have announced GitHub Sponsors,

328
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,880
which they say is a new way to contribute to open source.

329
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,280
Yeah, not content with trying to own the whole developer space in terms of code. Now, Microsoft

330
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:30,680
wants to get involved with how people get paid for open source, which is a very cynical

331
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:37,560
way to look at what is ultimately potentially a great new revenue stream from source developers,

332
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,880
but I'm going to be cynical nonetheless.

333
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,360
There's always an angle. There is always an angle. Even when they do something pretty

334
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,280
remarkable, at least for the first year, they've done a couple of things that are pretty remarkable.

335
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:57,560
No fees, so everything goes 100% goes to the developer and they're matching up to 5,000

336
00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:04,520
per sponsor developer in the first year. I love how it's beyond gracious. It's more generous

337
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,400
than any other model out there, anything Patreon could hope to do, and yet people are still

338
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,300
very skeptical. I guess stay skeptical. It's healthy, everybody.

339
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,760
The basics of how this thing is going to work is anyone with a GitHub account can sponsor

340
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:22,480
anyone with a, quote, sponsor developer profile through a recurring monthly payment. You can

341
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,320
choose different sponsorship tiers and different monthly amounts with benefits that are set

342
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,160
by that sponsor developer. Your sponsorship shares your existing billing date and payment

343
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,880
method information that you might already have in your GitHub account.

344
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,760
Now right now, today, this is kind of like a future thing. There's a very small number

345
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,160
of sponsor developers that are currently participating in what they call a limited

346
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:50,820
beta. Eventually, the goal is anyone who contributes to an open source project is eligible to become

347
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,480
a sponsor developer in the future.

348
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,800
We're not trying to completely control things here because it's really easy to just add

349
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:04,480
a YAML file to your GitHub that has the various places that you want to be supported. Patreon

350
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,400
is one of the supported places, as well as the community bridge, which we've talked about

351
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,800
before from the Linux Foundation. It's not open source, but yeah, well, let's cross over

352
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:21,240
that. It's not purely a GitHub thing, which is nice to see. Clearly, they want to centralize

353
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:28,020
it around GitHub, but they are giving other options there. Maybe I'm being cynical just

354
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:35,760
for the sake of it, just to kind of play up to my role, but I do have to wonder what Microsoft's

355
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,860
end game is, what's in it for them. Maybe it's just good PR for them, and good PR is

356
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,040
always good for any company.

357
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,360
Maybe. Or maybe this has nothing to do with Microsoft. Maybe this is just something the

358
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,480
folks in GitHub saw an opportunity to do. Who knows, really? That's probably a little

359
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,680
naive, but we don't really know the full story. Perhaps we can look into it. Right now, I

360
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,600
think they're really only taking sponsorships too from individuals, which feels like it's

361
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:09,240
good. That's a good start, but it's not really going to change anybody's life, and that's

362
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,920
why I'm not like buying into this whole like it's a way to take over the finance of open

363
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,500
source. Let's not kid ourselves here. This is going to be coffee and pizza money for

364
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:22,560
these people. We're not talking like wages here. Now, if GitHub came up with a way to

365
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:28,480
entice companies to invest part of their marketing budget into developers so that that way the

366
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:35,040
company got some sort of public recognition for supporting open source, then you could

367
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:41,460
change things because individuals can't contribute a lot, but even companies with not a lot of

368
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:47,280
money to donate generally have a lot of money in the marketing budget. If you can get ahead

369
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:51,120
of them and it becomes a common practice to sponsor open source projects where there's

370
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,400
some sort of... There would have to be a return on investment that everybody's comfortable

371
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,600
with, but then we'd start seeing serious money come into the system. Then I would probably

372
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,040
buy it's the conspiracy to change funding of open source because that would actually

373
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,160
make a difference, but until something like that comes along, this is coffee money for

374
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:13,160
folks and it's really good to see it. I'll probably participate because hell, if I can

375
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,200
at least get somebody a coffee or a beer, at least that's something, but we're not changing

376
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
lives here yet.

377
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,320
Well, not yet, but I'm sure that's the plan long term and whether that does mean proper

378
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,880
corporate sponsorship or just individuals remains to be seen. It's very early days for

379
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,160
this as we said.

380
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,100
As they say, Joe, but we'll keep our ears to the ground and learn more as this thing

381
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:37,120
develops because it's brand new right now, but your Jupiter Broadcasting team is on it.

382
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:41,800
Just like we're on all of the stories in Linux and the open source world every single week
