00:00.000 --> 00:10.200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, Episode 247, recorded on June 29, 2022.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.200
I'm Chris.

00:11.200 --> 00:12.200
And I'm Wes.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.200
Hello, Wes.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.840
Let's do the news.

00:14.840 --> 00:20.080
We start this week with the leading edge of the Linux desktop, and some new details about

00:20.080 --> 00:22.280
what's coming in Fedora 37.

00:22.280 --> 00:24.520
Yeah, there's a lot here.

00:24.520 --> 00:26.400
In fact, we're gonna have to link to most of it.

00:26.400 --> 00:30.320
But there's just so many things landing right now because the Fedora Engineering and Steering

00:30.320 --> 00:35.920
Committee has approved a fresh batch of features for the next version of Fedora.

00:35.920 --> 00:36.920
And there's a lot in here.

00:36.920 --> 00:43.840
But what does jump out at me is just some serious movements around the servers, I guess,

00:43.840 --> 00:49.080
editions of Fedora, including both the cloud workloads and the CoreOS workloads.

00:49.080 --> 00:54.000
For example, CoreOS may actually get promoted to an official edition this release cycle.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.640
But something that I'm surprised we haven't seen before, but is definitely much needed

00:57.640 --> 01:02.720
for Fedora in the cloud, we're now going to have a Fedora KVM disk image, which will be

01:02.720 --> 01:06.400
shipped as part of Fedora 37 Server Edition.

01:06.400 --> 01:11.280
Well, sticking with that server focus for just a moment, a change proposal has now been

01:11.280 --> 01:16.520
filed for getting Stratus 3.1 into Fedora 37.

01:16.520 --> 01:22.360
The proposal notes, quote, Stratus 3.1.0 includes significant improvements to the management

01:22.360 --> 01:27.240
of the thin provisioning layers, as well as a number of other user visible enhancements

01:27.240 --> 01:28.840
and bug fixes.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.760
So if you are a Stratus user out there, sounds like a release you don't want to miss.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.840
I have a feeling this is one of those LAN episodes that you and I are going to have

01:35.840 --> 01:39.080
like a big to do list afterwards because this is one of those things and we're going to

01:39.080 --> 01:41.940
get to another one in a minute that we're going to have to try.

01:41.940 --> 01:46.960
On the desktop side of things, especially for us x86-64 users, Fedora is now going to

01:46.960 --> 01:53.480
use GPT partitioning on new installs rather than MBR or MS-DOS for BIOSystems.

01:53.480 --> 01:57.520
Currently Fedora only uses GPT disk labels on an EFI system.

01:57.520 --> 02:03.000
And perhaps the biggest news buried in all of this is this new long term effort by Red Hat

02:03.000 --> 02:08.040
that's recently just begun to address general accessibility issues in Fedora.

02:08.040 --> 02:13.960
Yeah, on June 27, Christian Schaller announced that Red Hat has hired a blind software engineer

02:13.960 --> 02:20.120
to lead their efforts in, quote, making sure Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora Workstation

02:20.120 --> 02:23.640
has excellent accessibility support.

02:23.640 --> 02:27.880
And it looks like some of Lucas's first work will be going through applications which reported

02:27.880 --> 02:32.280
to GTK4 as part of the recent GNOME development cycle.

02:32.280 --> 02:36.640
Then it sounds like they plan to expand out from there and get broader and broader.

02:36.640 --> 02:41.560
In the announcement, they also write, quote, what we hope to get from this is not only

02:41.560 --> 02:46.640
a better experience for our users, but also to allow even more talented engineers like

02:46.640 --> 02:51.520
Lucas to work on Linux and open source software at Red Hat.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.440
We'll have a link to the announcement in the show notes.

02:54.440 --> 02:58.080
And you know, it's really just kind of a great read to get a high level understanding of

02:58.080 --> 03:01.840
the state of accessibility on Linux as it stands right now.

03:01.840 --> 03:09.480
And of course, where we might see improvements in the not too distant future.

03:09.480 --> 03:13.680
Two listener favorites got big updates this week, starting quickly with Firefox 102.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.640
I mean, there's really nothing too exciting in this release.

03:16.640 --> 03:17.640
There's a few things.

03:17.640 --> 03:21.240
I mean, I guess maybe you're a big fan of reading PDFs in high contrast mode or you've

03:21.240 --> 03:24.080
been looking forward to improved geolocation support under Linux.

03:24.080 --> 03:27.280
But in general, it's nothing that's going to knock your socks off.

03:27.280 --> 03:34.380
Well, if that doesn't excite you, maybe Thunderbird 102 should because this one seems like a big

03:34.380 --> 03:35.380
upgrade.

03:35.380 --> 03:40.320
For one, it introduces a new address book implementation, which surely took some work

03:40.320 --> 03:45.280
and maybe the biggest change in this entire release.

03:45.280 --> 03:50.680
But there's also a new import export wizard, a redesigned message header, and a few UI

03:50.680 --> 03:56.120
refinements like new icons and color folders that really pop.

03:56.120 --> 04:01.920
And of course, there's also that matrix chat support, which is probably something we should

04:01.920 --> 04:02.920
be trying.

04:02.920 --> 04:06.440
I was telling you, Wes, this is one of those episodes where we're going to have a to-do

04:06.440 --> 04:07.440
list.

04:07.440 --> 04:11.880
I mean, I've never thought about matrix in my email client, but I have to admit, I recently

04:11.880 --> 04:16.360
have been thinking about giving Thunderbird a go again, and I would probably try out the

04:16.360 --> 04:17.360
matrix stuff.

04:17.360 --> 04:21.000
There's some notable UI changes since I last looked at Thunderbird that have landed in

04:21.000 --> 04:22.580
this release specifically.

04:22.580 --> 04:24.640
There's this new spaces toolbar.

04:24.640 --> 04:28.080
They say it gives you fast and easy access to the most important activities.

04:28.080 --> 04:32.160
So in a single click, you can navigate between mail, your address book, your calendar, your

04:32.160 --> 04:35.820
tasks and your chats, or any of the other add-ons that you've installed.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.200
And the UI looks really slick.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.500
They've done a good job of making it easy to jump through there without taking up a

04:40.500 --> 04:45.400
huge portion of your UI sidebar to actually make it possible.

04:45.400 --> 04:48.660
And we have it on good authority that Thunderbird 102 is just the start of many good things

04:48.660 --> 04:49.660
to come.

04:49.660 --> 04:51.800
We did have a chat with Ryan Sipes recently.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.880
That was an episode 245 of Linux Action News.

04:54.880 --> 05:00.120
Don't miss that.

05:00.120 --> 05:05.720
Speaking of matrix, Synapse admins had to jump to action this week when it was discovered

05:05.720 --> 05:12.800
that in some cases, a URL preview could trigger a denial of service attack on a home server.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.600
Just a good old URL preview.

05:14.600 --> 05:19.680
Yeah, it seems like it was possible for this to be used maliciously, either by a user on

05:19.680 --> 05:26.680
the home server, or if a remote user sent a URL, which then a local user of that server

05:26.680 --> 05:31.720
tried to preview automatically with their client, it could then trigger the exploit.

05:31.720 --> 05:32.960
That's kind of the funny thing about it.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.080
Remote users were not actually able to directly trigger the exploit.

05:36.080 --> 05:42.880
But if a local user is in that room, and their client set to preview the URL, guess what?

05:42.880 --> 05:43.880
It's going to trigger it.

05:43.880 --> 05:47.960
Thankfully, though, the mitigation is pretty easy.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.800
URL previews aren't enabled by default.

05:49.800 --> 05:57.200
So if you do have them on, you need to flip that off ASAP, or update to release 1.61.1

05:57.200 --> 05:58.720
or greater.

05:58.720 --> 06:02.600
Not really a huge issue since it's just a denial of service and thankfully not something

06:02.600 --> 06:03.600
worse.

06:03.600 --> 06:09.720
But we want to make sure the word gets out.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.480
So are you still waiting on your Steam Deck?

06:11.480 --> 06:14.800
Well, we have some good news and some bad news.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.640
Valve tweeted this week saying it has more than doubled the number of Steam Decks being

06:18.640 --> 06:20.480
produced every week.

06:20.480 --> 06:25.960
The company also says it just sent out the last batch of Q2 reservation emails, and is

06:25.960 --> 06:30.880
prepared to start kicking off Q3 reservations on the 30th of June.

06:30.880 --> 06:38.800
That said, the expected availability date hasn't changed, it still says October 2022

06:38.800 --> 06:39.800
or later.

06:39.800 --> 06:45.680
But, you know, there is a chance that this date will change with production ramping up,

06:45.680 --> 06:50.680
since, you know, so far it's basically remained the same for months.

06:50.680 --> 06:56.480
All this makes me curious, Chris, have you been checking on your order status?

06:56.480 --> 06:57.800
Of course I did.

06:57.800 --> 06:58.800
Of course.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.480
Nothing's changed.

07:00.480 --> 07:01.480
Anyone can check.

07:01.480 --> 07:06.080
You can go to store.steampowered.com slash Steam Deck, and then you have to log in with

07:06.080 --> 07:07.080
your Steam ID.

07:07.080 --> 07:12.440
I ordered the 512 gig version, and Steam tells me that my expected order availability is

07:12.440 --> 07:21.120
Q3 July through September of 2022, which could be any day as we record, or could be a ways

07:21.120 --> 07:22.120
away.

07:22.120 --> 07:27.520
But the funny thing is, Wes, as time goes on, honestly, the less I'm excited about it.

07:27.520 --> 07:28.920
I don't know, we'll see what happens first.

07:28.920 --> 07:32.920
I get my Steam Deck, or I lose interest and cancel my pre-order.

07:32.920 --> 07:38.600
Stay tuned and find out.

07:38.600 --> 07:45.000
Video fans need not apply, because the world's truly best text editor has taken a big step

07:45.000 --> 07:47.520
with a major new release.

07:47.520 --> 07:53.680
Vim 9.0 has been announced, and besides many small additions, the spotlight this time around

07:53.680 --> 07:59.840
is on a new incarnation of the VimScript language, Vim9Script.

07:59.840 --> 08:03.520
A new incarnation of the VimScript language?

08:03.520 --> 08:04.560
What is this, Emacs?

08:04.560 --> 08:05.560
What does Vim need this for?

08:05.560 --> 08:08.680
Okay, okay, let's set a little context here.

08:08.680 --> 08:14.160
Vim's been around for a long time, as has its scripting language, and it's basically

08:14.160 --> 08:18.520
preserved backwards compatibility most of that time.

08:18.520 --> 08:23.300
And that means whatever perhaps bad choices from the past that were made, those are still

08:23.300 --> 08:24.600
haunting us today.

08:24.600 --> 08:30.360
Keep in mind, there's also some compatibility with things like legacy VI that are a factor

08:30.360 --> 08:31.800
here.

08:31.800 --> 08:36.600
All of that adds up, and it means that execution is slow.

08:36.600 --> 08:41.640
Doesn't help that each line is parsed and interpreted every time it's executed.

08:41.640 --> 08:47.680
So one of the main goals of this new script is to dramatically improve performance.

08:47.680 --> 08:52.160
One way that's accomplished is by compiling commands into bytecode that can be more efficiently

08:52.160 --> 08:55.200
executed, so it doesn't have to be parsed every time.

08:55.200 --> 09:02.680
And that leads to an expected increase in execution speed of something like 10 to 100

09:02.680 --> 09:03.680
times.

09:03.680 --> 09:08.400
Now, besides that great performance improvement, a secondary goal of this whole new script

09:08.400 --> 09:14.400
version is to avoid some Vim-specific oddities, which are definitely there, and get a lot

09:14.400 --> 09:19.160
closer to something more like a programming language developers are already using.

09:19.160 --> 09:26.080
You know, something like JavaScript, Python, or Java.

09:26.080 --> 09:28.040
Linode.com slash LAN.

09:28.040 --> 09:33.040
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and you go there to support the

09:33.040 --> 09:34.040
show.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.140
Linode is really the Linux geeks cloud.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.400
With 11 data centers worldwide, they've been working at this for nearly 19 years, and they

09:39.400 --> 09:43.120
have built the best experience for running applications on Linux.

09:43.120 --> 09:44.840
I hear it from listeners all the time.

09:44.840 --> 09:48.080
They're blown away by the performance, the support, and the pricing.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.820
All the things that drew me in.

09:49.820 --> 09:53.000
And if you like to build things yourself, or you like to do things with simple one-click

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
deployments, Linode has infrastructure that's going to work for you.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.360
Pricing, skill level, they got something to match all of it.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.080
I think once you get in there, you'll be damn impressed by the performance.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.720
It's fricking incredible.

10:03.720 --> 10:06.200
They got their own ISP connections, right?

10:06.200 --> 10:08.240
They don't deal with somebody else.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.720
They are their own ISP.

10:09.720 --> 10:12.120
And with 11 data centers around the world, there's something that's going to work for

10:12.120 --> 10:14.720
you, something that's close to you.

10:14.720 --> 10:17.320
And one of the things I really appreciate is I've been a customer now for over two and

10:17.320 --> 10:21.800
a half years, is Linode is always rolling out better and faster stuff.

10:21.800 --> 10:28.440
AMD EPYC processors, NVME-based block storage, physical servers, database as a service, object

10:28.440 --> 10:29.440
storage expansion.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.560
It has just been something like every month.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.120
Linode's always working on stuff.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.320
And their team is always analyzing what's going on in the world.

10:37.320 --> 10:41.880
In fact, they publish a security digest report that's super useful for anyone in the industry,

10:41.880 --> 10:43.440
even if you're not a Linode customer.

10:43.440 --> 10:45.940
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

10:45.940 --> 10:50.800
It's a good read if you're looking for a snapshot of what you need to know about in the Linux

10:50.800 --> 10:52.960
security world right now.

10:52.960 --> 10:56.280
After you've been using Linode for a minute, if you're like me, I think you'll learn to

10:56.280 --> 10:58.160
appreciate some of the tooling built around it.

10:58.160 --> 11:02.200
They have a really straightforward API, super easy to understand.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.200
There's libraries for like Python and just about everything else out there that you could

11:05.200 --> 11:09.000
plug in with an existing application, or you could use their pre-built CLI application.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
I do that.

11:10.000 --> 11:14.400
It's a great way to interface with their S3 object storage, which is fricking great.

11:14.400 --> 11:17.400
And what really puts things over the top is you can get a hundred dollars and support

11:17.400 --> 11:18.720
the show and then you can go build something.

11:18.720 --> 11:19.720
You can learn something.

11:19.720 --> 11:20.860
You can try something.

11:20.860 --> 11:24.480
See what professional grade services are like from people that have been doing this for

11:24.480 --> 11:28.760
nearly 19 years that really know their stuff.

11:28.760 --> 11:29.760
Go try it.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.760
Go support the show and get a hundred bucks in credit.

11:32.760 --> 11:38.640
Linode.com slash LAN.

11:38.640 --> 11:44.000
You might've heard Apple has some shiny new M chips and maybe you were wondering just

11:44.000 --> 11:48.200
how long it's going to take to get Linux working on them.

11:48.200 --> 11:53.800
Well Hector Martin has been leading the effort to get Linux working on Apple's new SOCs,

11:53.800 --> 12:00.600
held a marathon live development stream this week to kick that bring up process off.

12:00.600 --> 12:01.600
So yeah.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.600
Hello everyone.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.960
It's been a while.

12:03.960 --> 12:12.680
Today I'm going to be bringing up Asahi Linux on the new Apple M2 chip.

12:12.680 --> 12:14.320
And this was quite the stream.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.740
I think it was over 11 hours long.

12:17.740 --> 12:20.540
So yeah, you're going to get to see the whole process.

12:20.540 --> 12:25.960
And kind of ironically, even though the stream was over 11 hours long, it only took Hector

12:25.960 --> 12:30.000
about 20 minutes to get Linux booting on the M2.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.000
Yay.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
It's alive.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.000
Cool.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
All right.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
So we're good.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.000
It runs.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
That was easy.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
First try.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
And there we go.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.000
It's alive.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
You could really tell he was excited.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
He was happy to get that going.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.080
But then he spent the rest of the stream just tweaking things.

12:45.080 --> 12:49.240
And then his chat room joked that they'd gone to bed and woke up to find Hector still hacking

12:49.240 --> 12:51.280
away on the stream.

12:51.280 --> 12:54.160
But of course, there's still more work to be done.

12:54.160 --> 12:58.400
Unfortunately, the keyboard and the trackpad with the new Apple M2 devices will require

12:58.400 --> 13:00.440
a new driver to work properly.

13:00.440 --> 13:06.200
Additionally, SPMI will need a new driver and the PCIe support needs a fuse map in the

13:06.200 --> 13:09.280
mini code to initialize properly.

13:09.280 --> 13:14.080
There's also PMU, Thunderbolt and a bunch of other functionality that's still on the

13:14.080 --> 13:16.080
growing to do list.

13:16.080 --> 13:19.240
Yeah, that's a lot of stuff.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.840
And of course, there's also that Apple graphic stack.

13:21.840 --> 13:25.200
That's really the elephant in the desktop room right now.

13:25.200 --> 13:30.000
Progress has been made there, though, including we got a triangle drawn on the screen.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.440
But let's be real, there's still just a long ways to go just on the graphic stack.

13:34.440 --> 13:40.120
Yeah, I require at least two triangles from my desktop minimum, please.

13:40.120 --> 13:44.800
I'd say it's safe to say set your expectations to months at best before we have something

13:44.800 --> 13:50.520
like a full featured OpenGL driver or a DRM kernel driver that was suitable for upstreaming

13:50.520 --> 13:52.440
or anything close to those.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.320
Yeah, I'd say that's probably fair.

13:55.320 --> 14:01.000
Maybe we'll be pleasantly surprised, but I'd say months to keep an eye on this and everything

14:01.000 --> 14:04.240
