00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,600
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,120
This is episode 82, recorded on December 2nd, 2018.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,120
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,120
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,120
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:30,520
I do not believe it's December already, but I can believe the news around ClearLinux.

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,640
I won't spoil a prediction, but I think ClearLinux is going to turn a lot of heads, and I think

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,040
they're just getting started.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,960
They caught my attention a few weeks ago when they announced KDE support, but now it seems

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,520
they're trying to up the desktop effort, including a new installer and other goodies.

11
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,440
Yeah, it's traditionally really been more for containers and, you know, cloud workloads,

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,440
doesn't it?

13
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,920
But I know that the team working on it use it as a desktop.

14
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
And it used to be Xfce.

15
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,240
They made a transition to GNOME, which no idea why they did that, but it has been used

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,880
as a desktop internally.

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,440
But now they're making it a bit easier to actually try out with a live image that has

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,160
got an installer in it.

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,120
The installer is a little bit basic, shall we say.

20
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,320
It's kind of in Curses style, but it is actually much easier than it used to be to get going

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,500
on the desktop now.

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,040
You do kind of wonder, right, if this is anything to do with Aiki going back to the team.

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,320
Aiki used to be the lead developer for Solus.

24
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,880
Now he's back working in Intel, working on ClearLinux.

25
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,480
And here we see initiatives focused at the desktop, which was a line of work that Aiki

26
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,000
was in when he was working on Solus.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,560
It seems like it's a possible connection to me.

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
I don't know about that.

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,000
This seems like the kind of thing that they must have been working on for a little while,

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,920
and he's only just rejoined that team, hasn't he?

31
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,080
So maybe he's had an influence there.

32
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,040
But you're right about it being one to watch, ClearLinux.

33
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,420
Because if you look at the Ferronix benchmarks, you know, Michael loves doing his benchmarks

34
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,880
over at Ferronix.

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,680
And ClearLinux seems to be up there, if not winning, almost every time, doesn't it?

36
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,240
Whether it's boot times or performance or whatever, it is a seriously solid distro.

37
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,640
But it just doesn't seem to get much attention, because I suppose it's not been that easy

38
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
to install.

39
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,520
But now it's a little bit easier.

40
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
Maybe it will.

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Yeah.

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,960
What I'm kind of getting at is it has that vibe to it that some projects get sometimes.

43
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,200
When you can see there's a lot of potential.

44
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,880
There's a clear industry sponsor behind it, Intel, that has a motivation for continuing

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,880
to work on the project.

46
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,240
And there is the groundwork for it to go big.

47
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,520
And I hear so many complimentary things from the audience about ClearLinux anytime we talk

48
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,000
about it.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,760
And when I go through the screenshots that Michael's dutifully put in the article that

50
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,760
we'll link at linuxactionnews.com slash 82, what I see here is something that is early

51
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,240
days but competent and ready to use.

52
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,240
It's NCURSUS-based.

53
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,400
You know, it's text-based.

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,120
But you go through, you select your package groups, you use their new partitioning tool,

55
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,960
which this is one of the new big features.

56
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,080
To your point, Joe, I think they have been working on this for a while.

57
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,280
That's one of those things they've been working on for a while.

58
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
It's all in there.

59
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,360
If you've ever installed a Linux distribution before, you're going to be able to do this,

60
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,820
even if you're not a command line pro.

61
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,680
And that's just one little rough edge that over time they could make even nicer.

62
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,640
They could replace that with a graphical installer.

63
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,280
And they're introducing features like this desktop live image that clearly is trying

64
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,520
to make it more accessible.

65
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, it sounds to me like you and Wes should have a look at this, install it on some hardware

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
and talk about it a lot.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yeah.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,760
I think it'll be coming to Linux Unplugged soon.

69
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,280
Will it work as a desktop?

70
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,560
That's something I'm willing to give that a go for a little bit.

71
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,040
I'll report my findings.

72
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,840
Well, my pro tip for you is don't try and install it on a legacy boot machine because

73
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,720
it needs EFI boot, by the looks of things, from my testing of it.

74
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
You know what?

75
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,000
Coming from Intel, that doesn't surprise me.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah, exactly.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I think the clear Linux boot manager is supposed to be one of the things that's pretty great

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
about it.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,280
Obviously, Intel want everyone to move over to proper EFI boot, but they'll take my legacy

80
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,360
boot from my cold dead hands, I'm afraid.

81
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,520
I've managed to build a system before they made that change, so hopefully I'll get four

82
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,540
or five years out of this and then just suck it up afterwards.

83
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,540
You know what, Joey?

84
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,240
It's not so bad.

85
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,080
I've just had to bite the bullet with my more recent systems, and it's not so bad.

86
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,380
In fact, they boot up a little faster.

87
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,380
It's actually kind of nice.

88
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,080
Yeah, but I don't like all those extra partitions.

89
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,520
You are old school.

90
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,720
Yeah, you and your XFCE.

91
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,400
I do actually kind of agree with you there.

92
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,360
I don't like it either, but I've just learned to live with it.

93
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,440
I just go crazy now with my partitioning.

94
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
Yeah.

95
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,480
So, speaking of Linux Unplugged then, you had Matthew Miller on last week talking about

96
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:03,720
Fedora 31 and how that is fairly likely to be delayed by six months.

97
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah, a proposal that they have out there right now is to say, let's essentially skip

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,640
the 31 release cycle and spend that time retooling the distribution, reorganizing parts of how

99
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,880
we do the release, and fixing some of the tools that have really grown over the years

100
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,080
and make it hard to just spin off one particular edition of Fedora or something like that.

101
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,080
And the timing is precarious for multiple reasons.

102
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,280
Yeah, this is IBM coming along and ruining it already.

103
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,040
Yeah, before the thing's even complete, they're already...

104
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,280
Yeah, the deal hasn't actually gone through and they're already, no, this has nothing

105
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,280
to do with that.

106
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
You think?

107
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,280
Well...

108
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
I don't know.

109
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,920
I mean, the timing is...it does mean that by the time the next Fedora would be released,

110
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,680
the acquisition would be final.

111
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,600
I honestly don't think that that has got much to do with it.

112
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,760
I think this has been looming for a very long time because you only have to listen to what

113
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:04,880
Matthew said to you on Linux Unplugged, and you can hear that they've been collecting

114
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,960
this technical debt for so long, and it's taken them just a day to put the distro together,

115
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,040
not even build the packages, just kind of compose, he calls it, where they pull all

116
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,080
the packages together and make the image and everything, and that's just unsustainable.

117
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,960
They want to get that down to just a few hours, and it sounds like they just need to get their

118
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,440
technical house in order, and maybe the IBM thing has got a slight influence over this,

119
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,040
but I like to think that it's far more technical in nature and much less political.

120
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,640
Something else that Matthew said was that this is really in service of a larger objective

121
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,600
they set a while ago, and this is one of the ways they think they can accomplish that as

122
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,720
a project.

123
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,920
The timing is also just precarious because Gnome Shell is in a rapid state of improvement

124
00:06:52,920 --> 00:07:01,440
right now, and to miss a release cycle of Gnome Shell is tricky for a distribution that's

125
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,520
supposed to be the Gnome Shell showcase.

126
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,880
I think they're going to have to solve that problem, maybe either via modularity in the

127
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,120
software repository, flat packs, snaps, I don't know how they're going to solve it,

128
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,520
but wouldn't that be something?

129
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,560
Just for a laugh, canonical out of a rush to get the Gnome 3 desktop all snapped up

130
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,080
and then Fedora users could give it a go.

131
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,120
I don't know, it's a precarious time, but I'll tell you my first reaction before I talked

132
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:38,960
to Matthew was personally kind of just a little negative because I have this bias as a longtime

133
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,040
sysadmin from days back that developers will often try to have, they'll get stuck, they'll

134
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,760
get stuck on a really hard problem and they'll start obsessing over their tools.

135
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,560
What editor they're using, what their laptop, the monitor layout, all of it, they'll just

136
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,400
start going at it and open source developers do this too and a lot of times they'll stop

137
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,600
and they'll decide, you know what, it's time to break this into a modular architecture

138
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,120
with a client server architecture or we need to rebuild our infrastructure or we can't

139
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,200
really complete this project until we have this new bug tracker in place.

140
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,380
As an open source consumer, it often feels like progress will all of a sudden halt on

141
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:26,120
your favorite project while the project does like some sort of self-analysis and self-correction

142
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:33,920
that ultimately is in service for the consumer, but as a consumer feels like it's sort of

143
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,600
seems like navel gazing from the project standpoint.

144
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,680
And so that was my initial reaction was, oh no, we're going to get caught in another one

145
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,640
of these tool spirals, but it was pretty clearly outlined in a problems document that they

146
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,800
have on their Wiki that they're trying to solve and there is some serious technical

147
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,480
debt in there and when I read through that and after I talked to Matthew, I kind of feel

148
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,160
like it'd be good for the project, not only because they could solve some of these issues,

149
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,480
but according to their own data, the last time they did this, when they switched to

150
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,140
additions of Fedora back in like the 2021 release era, that became one of their most

151
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:14,800
popular releases ever because people could run it for a year and they had batches and

152
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,060
they loved it and they built servers on it and products on it.

153
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,280
So Fedora 30 may end up being the most popular Fedora release ever.

154
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,680
Well, it would make me more likely to use it if you had that extra support and it seems

155
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,880
that I'm not alone in thinking that because there was a proposal on the mailing list to

156
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:38,840
kind of offshoot from the discussion of whether or not to delay 31 and that was a discussion

157
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,400
about well, why don't we just move to an annual release cycle rather than every six months

158
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:49,920
and for me, that seems like a brilliant splitting of the difference between Fedora as it stands

159
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,720
now and the Ubuntu LTSs.

160
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,920
I kind of like the idea.

161
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,440
I do kind of like it and I kind of like where you're going with it too because you don't

162
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,340
need to solve the problems the same way we've always solved them.

163
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,800
There's lots of new ways to solve those problems, including software modularity and Flatpak.

164
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,480
I mean, I know I just made a joke about those, but you could just Flatpak up Gnome Shell

165
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,200
and deliver Gnome Shell as Flatpaks and have that on top of a stable Fedora 30 release

166
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,320
or 31 release, especially if they go to a longer cadence and if modularity would allow

167
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,960
me to get deeper user land or maybe even kernel repositories that are from newer versions

168
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,880
or maybe even rawhide, we could really be talking business here.

169
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,180
Now, as much as you and I might think this would be pretty great, this is probably not

170
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,180
going anywhere.

171
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,040
It's not even formally drafted as an actual proposal.

172
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,600
It was really just kind of a discussion that kicked off on the mailing list.

173
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,560
But I guess I do see why there is a fair amount of pushback.

174
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,800
It would really change the way they've been doing things for a long time.

175
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,900
I guess if I was going to see this go any way there, I would kind of like to see it

176
00:10:52,900 --> 00:11:00,440
go the other direction instead of like these big old static yearly dumps.

177
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,120
Why not something a little more closer to rolling and this is Fedora we're talking about

178
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
here.

179
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,080
Now, I know like rawhide is not really in a suitable state to do this with, but what

180
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:16,960
if it was kind of something closer to KDE neon and it was a pretty stable Fedora base

181
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:23,780
that didn't change much, new kernels and you got fresh user land stuff and then they would

182
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,400
maybe rev the base, which would be the core, which would be what the cloud and server editions

183
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,580
are based off of.

184
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,580
You do that.

185
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,160
That's the part you can rev once a year.

186
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,600
And they've got DNF, the upgrade process down so great that if you're not having to worry

187
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,800
about having to upgrade all your user land and your lower level stuff at the same time,

188
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,600
it's going to be a lot cleaner, a lot simpler.

189
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,320
That is a Fedora workstation I could kind of get excited about.

190
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,840
I think you might be dreaming there because even though Fedora is known for being sort

191
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,840
of cutting edge and everything, it's a major change you're talking about there that would

192
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:02,300
take a lot of planning and if they're in the middle of retooling the entire build process

193
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,920
and everything, that is just a bridge too far I think right now.

194
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,840
Maybe in a few years they could think about something like that, but again, Fedora seems

195
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,240
to be working quite well as it is on a six monthly cycle.

196
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,280
It's not really for me, but I think that it has its target audience as it is.

197
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,280
And now with the modularity, I don't think you need to push that as far as you're talking

198
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:29,680
about to make it useful and it just doesn't feel broken so it doesn't need to be fixed

199
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,680
to me.

200
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,960
I see what you're saying, I just think it's going to be, again, it's just what I started

201
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,260
this thing with.

202
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,160
It's a tricky time to be doing this because you've got CentOS out there that's also free,

203
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,840
it's going to be based on RHEL 8 when that ships.

204
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,960
You could flat pack and modular the crap out of that and make yourself a pretty nice up

205
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,600
to date workstation that has like 10 years of support.

206
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,920
And I'm just wondering like where's Fedora going to fit in this future in a couple of

207
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:01,240
years if they don't do something interesting and different, I could see a world where I'm

208
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,020
sitting here on a ThinkPad running CentOS 8 subscribed to the latest GNOME and user

209
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,900
land applications and I'm pretty happy and I don't really change it.

210
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,080
That could be a future for me.

211
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,000
It's a long shot, but it may be more likely than this being a Fedora workstation anytime

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
soon.

213
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,160
Would Red Hat slash IBM care, probably not.

214
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,440
Everybody seems to want that developer market, that Sputnik market.

215
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,360
You know, the XPS Sputnik effort just hit their six year anniversary and I think it

216
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,760
took a while, but just about the entire industry has recognized what they're doing over there

217
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
at Dell.

218
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,320
I mean, you've got Microsoft now shipping the Windows subsystem for Linux, Google has

219
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,320
built in Linux into Chrome, including full GUI applications as well as terminals.

220
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,080
And next Tuesday on Linux Unplugged, I'm going to have a chat with the ISH developer-ish.

221
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:03,800
It is a Linux user land for iOS, a full-fledged Alpine Linux environment with a package manager,

222
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:10,160
tools like YouTube DL and ping and traceroute, all on iOS.

223
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,040
And this isn't just out of nowhere.

224
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,600
It's because there is a market for this stuff, for the Sputniks, for the machines running

225
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,600
Linux.

226
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,680
There's a market for it.

227
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,120
It's just a particular kind of market.

228
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,840
And if IBM had any sense at all anymore, they'd be going after that market because those are

229
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:31,280
the individuals that are building applications for that hybrid cloud that they want to own.

230
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
Yeah.

231
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,680
I've actually tried out that ISH thing on an iPad that I borrowed and it is rock solid.

232
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,760
So yeah, look forward to listening to that.

233
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
Yeah.

234
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,920
I just had to, I was like, I had to find out.

235
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:47,960
Like was he a diehard Apple user trying to dabble in Linux or was he a diehard Linux

236
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,120
user trying to get it on iOS?

237
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,680
So I had to call him up and I had a chat with him.

238
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,680
I already recorded it.

239
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,320
So I'm just going to put it in the next episode of Linux Unplugged.

240
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
All right.

241
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
Well, you mentioned Google there.

242
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,020
And one thing that they have been pushing for the last few years is AMP, accelerated

243
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,880
mobile pages.

244
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,080
And we reported on this a couple of months ago that they were looking to go for a new

245
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,760
governance model, which would mean that they weren't as in charge of it and they'd make

246
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,280
it more of a community effort.

247
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:20,160
Well, that has now happened and there are now a lot of companies involved in this officially.

248
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Yes.

249
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Yes.

250
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
This is good.

251
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,640
I mean, the two key features we're seeing really become established is the governance

252
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,000
models, the technical steering committee and the advisory committee.

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,480
So you have the TSC and the AC and these are the committees that Joe's talking about that

254
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:46,240
are pretty well-established companies, ACMI, CloudFlare, Washington Post, Vox Media, several

255
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,560
Google employees, eBay, 1-800-Flowers, it goes on.

256
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,680
The list, the technical steering committee has more Google members, has three Google

257
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,320
members and then a few other from the rest of the industry like Microsoft and Twitter

258
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
and Pinterest.

259
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,640
However, I really don't get a sense of this is really much more independent from Google.

260
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,100
In fact, when you look at the people that are organizing all of this and the people

261
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,320
that are sort of organizing those committees and that are sort of at the top, they're all

262
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
Google.

263
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
It's all Google.

264
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,440
I mean, I understand and appreciate that this is their baby and it's just moved out and

265
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,880
it just got its first apartment and I'm sitting here going like, well, but your folks are

266
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,280
still paying for your car insurance, like what the hell, kid?

267
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,660
Like I get it, but we're not there yet, right?

268
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,360
This is still early days.

269
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,040
Well, the cynical person would say that they're just paying lip service to the complaints

270
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,160
that the community had and that this is really just a bone doggle.

271
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,000
It's not really them making any serious changes, whereas the optimist might say that it is

272
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
a good first step.

273
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,600
It's a very solid first step and it shows that they are serious about bringing the community

274
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,500
into this thing and that that community involvement will expand over time and Google's grip on

275
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,560
it will get lighter and lighter until they are just one of many companies involved in

276
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
it.

277
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:08,920
I think the reality is probably somewhere in between those two, but I probably lean

278
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,040
a little bit more on the first one, to be honest.

279
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,580
I'll give Google this.

280
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,520
This is a good effort and this is a little bit of a different tact than they normally

281
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,840
take with their open source projects.

282
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:25,240
I think this is going to serve them well and if it is successful and it perhaps gets more

283
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:29,840
adoption in the industry, I think Google's going to be happy with this and they'll probably,

284
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,800
like you say, let it essentially be run by the industry.

285
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,940
I think if it's a failure and it really doesn't get them any more traction, they'll pivot.

286
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:40,640
If this goes nowhere, I don't think Google's done with AMP.

287
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
Oh yeah.

288
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,920
Well, it's been very successful for them.

289
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,840
If you do virtually any Google search on a phone, you're going to hit an AMP page as

290
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
one of the first results.

291
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
Yeah.

292
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,140
And for the most part, it's kind of a good end user experience.

293
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,240
That's the worst thing about it.

294
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,760
It's like when I use it, I'm like, oh, that's not bad.

295
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
Yeah.

296
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,200
There are some problems with it, but generally speaking, it is faster.

297
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,000
And if you're on mobile data, then it's just a no brainer really.

298
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yeah.

299
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,040
Well, like we always say, I suppose we'll see where this one goes.

300
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,240
But chances are, if you are on an Asino mobile phone, AMP's going to work for you.

301
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
A what?

302
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
An Asino what, Joe?

303
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
Yeah.

304
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,240
Is it Asino?

305
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
Is it Nikuno?

306
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
I don't know.

307
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,240
Yeah.

308
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,240
Don't ask me.

309
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
Yeah.

310
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,000
Either way, it's a phone that has been announced and I suppose almost pre-announced really

311
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,560
if that's even a thing.

312
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,800
And it's going to be running Plasma Mobile.

313
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,280
And that's pretty much all we know about it apart from some of the hardware specs, which

314
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,600
are modest, shall we say, but positive in the freedom dimension.

315
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,240
I'm not familiar with this vendor, and I'm not particularly excited about this hardware.

316
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,320
But this does seem like a good feather in the cap for the Plasma Mobile project, which

317
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,280
I think has had this really great rational approach to building for mobile for a while

318
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,280
now.

319
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,240
So maybe this will be the hardware, but it's getting there.

320
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,480
Every time they have a shot on real hardware, they have a chance to try it out in production,

321
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,760
in the real world, work out bugs.

322
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,760
It's good for the project.

323
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
Yeah.

324
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,120
And I mentioned it's positive in the freedom dimension.

325
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:12,120
And that's because it's got this IMX 6 CPU with the Vivante GPU, which doesn't require

326
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,120
blobs.

327
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,920
You do need blobs to get LTE working.

328
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,060
And so that's why we're not going to see that straight away.

329
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:25,000
But this is kind of like what Purism are trying to do, but a little bit less ambitious, and

330
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,800
therefore probably a little bit more likely to happen.

331
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:35,540
So I'm not massively excited about it, because it's not going to be this flagship, super

332
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,760
performant device with convergence and everything.

333
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,200
But I think there is a market for a freedom-respecting phone.

334
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,940
And I think that people will put up with lower specs as long as it works reasonably well.

335
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,040
Now the problem that we have with this is it's all a bit vague at this point.

336
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,360
I said pre-announced, which is kind of a nonsense term, but that's almost what we've got here.

337
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,880
Because we don't really know what Plasma Mobile is going to be running on top of, because

338
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
that's just an interface.

339
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,600
So we don't know, is it going to be Debian?

340
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Is it going to be?

341
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
Who knows?

342
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,420
It's going to be some sort of Linux, and probably some sort of GNU slash Linux.

343
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,600
But it's very early days, so we just don't know really.

344
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,360
But it's building a bit more hype and getting a bit more interest in Plasma Mobile, which

345
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,560
we thought we were going to have as a kind of first-class citizen on the Purism phone,

346
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
the Librem 5.

347
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,120
But now that's looking increasingly less likely, and it's going to be all about the GNOME shell

348
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,480
on there.

349
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,760
So I think anything that shines a light on Plasma Mobile is good.

350
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,160
But I spoke to Jonathan Riddle about this, and he didn't know too much about it.

351
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:48,920
And apparently, Nikuno, Nisuno, whatever, are not really putting many resources into

352
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,040
it in terms of KDE, apart from giving the project some phones to hack on and stuff.

353
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,040
So it's not like a major undertaking for them.

354
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,480
But who knows?

355
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,040
It feels like we're clutching at straws, doesn't it, with proper Linux on mobile at this point.

356
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,000
But I just hope that we're wrong about that.

357
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,600
I don't think there is a market for it.

358
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,760
You say there's a market for it.

359
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
I don't think there is.

360
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:19,240
I mean, I guess it define, unless you want to define market as 200,000, 300,000 units

361
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
a year.

362
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,400
Well, if I could make a phone and sell 200,000 or 300,000 units, I'd be quite happy.

363
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,160
But nobody can, right?

364
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,000
That's the problem, is no one can.

365
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,760
To make a phone that is actually the quality of a phone, you have to have scale of manufacturing.

366
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Yeah, true.

367
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,120
And that's just even to get something that has halfway decent battery life and can make

368
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:40,440
a phone call in the US, let alone anywhere else in the world.

369
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,720
The thing is, is this is why I like projects like Ubiports and like Plasma Mobile, because

370
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,960
I don't think there's enough market for one phone to sell so many copies that now all

371
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,400
of a sudden one of these projects is funded and can develop a great free operating system

372
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
for mobile.

373
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
It's just never going to happen.

374
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,000
They're not going to sell tens of millions, probably wouldn't have to sell.

375
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,520
It's just not going to happen.

376
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:14,480
But there is a deep, deep market of used devices and even newer devices and there will be market

377
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,760
competitors that we haven't seen yet that have more flexibility that can be introduced.

378
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:24,040
And these will be perfect candidates for these types of projects.

379
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:30,220
I can't see anyone who's going to be successful in trying to sell a phone to the free software

380
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,520
crowd and be sustainable.

381
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,760
I mean, if that was the case, then these Lenovo's that are out there, you say they don't care

382
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,120
about specs, but if that was the case, then these Lenovo's out there that are reflashing

383
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,040
them with all free software would be selling like hotcakes.

384
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,520
I think they sell them in small batches at best.

385
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,120
If they get lucky, maybe they sell it to an organization or a school, but that's got to

386
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,640
be their rare sale.

387
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,720
It's really kind of the market's spoken, like they've decided and it's not a product that

388
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
they want.

389
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,440
See, I'm not saying this is a good thing, I'm just saying it's the reality.

390
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,000
Yeah, well tell that to Purism.

391
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I think it just did.

392
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,960
All right, we better move on then.

393
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,760
And this is definitely good news and there's no way that you can be cynical about this.

394
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,800
The Linux Foundation and the RISC-V Foundation have announced a joint collaboration.

395
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,760
The RISC-V Foundation is no slouch either.

396
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:27,080
It has 210 institutional academic and individual members from all around the world.

397
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,400
And this is any way you look at it, got to be a good thing if it means we're going to

398
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,080
get some RISC-V devices.

399
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:39,040
I don't know why I should care, to be honest with you, other than I think RISC-V is a good

400
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
thing.

401
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
Go RISC.

402
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
You know what I mean?

403
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
Well, kind of.

404
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,440
I think you should care because it adds legitimacy to RISC-V.

405
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,440
Fair enough.

406
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,720
I guess if I didn't mean to sound like it didn't, I mean, I just care because I want

407
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,200
RISC to be successful and I want them to have more legitimacy.

408
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,560
But it's hard when you start talking about these bureaucratic layers joining up, it's

409
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,880
kind of like, I don't really know what this means.

410
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,720
Does this mean maybe more hardware providers will get interested?

411
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
I don't know what it means.

412
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,720
I don't know why to care.

413
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:16,880
Well, the Linux Foundation are good at the money side of things, let's just say.

414
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:23,160
And that has to be good because it potentially means that they could use their connections

415
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:30,720
within the industry to push RISC-V and push more openness, therefore, and push it back

416
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,560
against x86 and ARM, which is locked down and uses loads of blobs.

417
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:40,600
Well, I contacted someone at the Linux Foundation who works there and asked them about this

418
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,520
because I know they're a big RISC-V fan.

419
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,560
And she told me that it is also going to be a part governance thing as well.

420
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,000
And I don't know what that means.

421
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,320
But there's apparently maybe some community outreach and get togethers.

422
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,320
Maybe that's working with hardware partners and managing that process.

423
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,640
So the Linux Foundation is kind of known for doing that as well.

424
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,600
So again, you can see where there is some nice overlap where RISC-V needed some help,

425
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,500
the Foundation, and the Linux Foundation is set up to offer it.

426
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,160
I hope this accelerates everything.

427
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,480
Yeah, so do I.

428
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,160
And time will tell, but I've got a feeling that it will be good ultimately.

429
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:24,560
So let's end with, for me, the highlight of the Amazon event, reiInvent, that they had

430
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,400
going on this week.

431
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,040
And you talked about this on TechSnap last week.

432
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,400
So I don't think we need to go into too much detail.

433
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:36,680
But Firecracker, the mini VMs, I think this is going to be huge.

434
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,400
I think all the buzz is around two main things about Firecracker.

435
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,520
Essentially, it's KVM-based VMs, but with the low overhead of a container.

436
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,480
So you're kind of getting your cake, and you're kind of getting to eat it too.

437
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,880
Plus, the second thing is, it's a proper open source project up on GitHub, and Amazon seems

438
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,880
to be keen, although we'll see, but seems to be keen on working with the community to

439
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,880
extend it.

440
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:06,100
Now, the hot sauce of this particular meal is that a lot of the hard work that takes

441
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:13,700
up resources and time is being done in a jailed process outside the VM.

442
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:19,740
It does that work outside, and then it fires up what they're calling a micro VM on top

443
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:23,900
of the Linux KVM system, which is a great virtualizer.

444
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:31,440
And now you can have VMs spun up in like 155-ish milliseconds, a fraction of a second, which

445
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,420
is one of the major advantage to containers.

446
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,840
And when you start looking at servers like AWS Lambda, which is a serverless service,

447
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,520
which is ironic because, of course, behind the scenes, you're spinning up servers.

448
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,960
But it's serverless.

449
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:51,040
And the way they're executing those processes is with Firecracker now, actually put into

450
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,760
production early, before they announced it, in Lambda.

451
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:00,720
And they're able to spin up these VMs in seconds, or less than seconds, in fractions of seconds,

452
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,400
and have the full isolation that a VM provides.

453
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,280
One of the things that's going to make this massively successful is just the speed of

454
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
it.

455
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:14,880
They're able to spin up 150 user space applications per second per host.

456
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,080
I mean, that is some serious stuff.

457
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,320
And that's just today, right?

458
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,360
That's early version on today's hardware.

459
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:27,320
You take the project out a few years on even faster hardware, and some of the custom hardware

460
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,780
that Amazon's working on right now, this is all x86-based, but they stated they're open

461
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,560
to porting it to other architectures, and it's an open source project.

462
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,640
This could be going places.

463
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,060
This could be like the next Docker, could also just be something that's really only

464
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,700
used at Amazon.

465
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,700
Only time will tell, Joe.

466
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,700
Ha ha.

467
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,760
We need to have like a jingle for like, let's wait and see, because that's what's so often

468
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,880
the case in these big open source projects.

469
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,880
Yeah.

470
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,480
I think that it will take off because they've open sourced it.

471
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,720
They've not done their usual of just using loads of open source stuff.

472
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,240
They've actually created it this time.

473
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,480
And I think that it will spread out there, because at least from the sounds of things,

474
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:11,320
it is technically absolutely excellent and seems to be servicing that niche between VMs

475
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,440
and containers.

476
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,120
And I think people are going to be all over this.

477
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,920
So I expect to see over the next couple of years, especially as they add support for

478
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,120
ARM, I think it's just going to be massive.

479
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:28,280
You know what Wes told me, not to spoil TechSnap 391, but there's one bit in there, it's not

480
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:32,080
one of the key bits, that he told me that actually kind of blew my mind.

481
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,260
This whole project really came out of Chrome OS.

482
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:40,320
This was the virtual monitor for Chrome OS that they've extended to do this, which is,

483
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,320
I don't know why that just tickles me a lot.

484
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,960
Yeah, Google and Amazon working together.

485
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,600
Who would have thought it?

486
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,880
Well, in a weird way, like they've given their cloud competitor, like perhaps its next best

487
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,960
weapon.

488
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,920
And they took it from a OS that was designed to supply a web browser as a desktop.

489
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,560
And the whole thing's just, I just, I love free software and open source, this stuff's

490
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,560
so great.

491
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,280
You can't make it up, right?

492
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
Yep.
