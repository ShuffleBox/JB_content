00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,560
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, Episode 257, recorded on September 6th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,680
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,680
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,680
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,640
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,440
Linux users living the enterprise lifestyle in a Windows shop felt the sting of the Microsoft

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:26,560
strategy text this week when they discovered the Teams app for Linux is being discontinued.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,600
Yeah, that stings for a lot of users because it can already be pretty tough as a Linux

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,500
user to exist in that kind of environment.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,480
And apps like Teams can be sort of like a cold drink of water to a user stuck in a compatibility

11
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,480
desert.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,680
I guess I'm just slightly surprised by this.

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,700
I'm not shocked, but I am slightly surprised since a big deal was made about Teams coming

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:54,280
to Linux in the first place, but when you realize that Microsoft doesn't even make a

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,280
native version of Teams for Windows, how much support can you really expect for their Linux

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,280
port?

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,840
In the announcement, Microsoft informed Linux users that they had figured out what their

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,640
next best option would be saying, quote, we found the best way to act on this is to offer

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,800
a Teams Progressive Web App, a PWA, on Linux as a new feature of our current web client,

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,840
which we'll be making available to our Linux customers in the coming months.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:26,200
While that was a considerably insufficient answer to many, and the upset here has been

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,920
notable, the real story is why Microsoft is making this change.

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:40,520
It appears to be related to moving Teams off of Electron and onto Microsoft's edge-based

24
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:49,080
WebView2, which at least as of this recording, has no Linux or Mac OS support.

25
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,160
Yeah, and I think a lot of people felt, okay, well then just keep supporting the Linux version

26
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,520
until the WebView2 port is ready.

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,080
And I don't know a lot of Linux users that love Electron, and I don't really know if

28
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,520
WebView2 is significantly better because it's still web technologies, although indications

29
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,960
seem to be that it is at least notably better than Electron.

30
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,360
I think for some, just losing an application like this isn't a great answer for them, and

31
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,880
while they were hoping for something other than Electron, this isn't what they were asking

32
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,880
for.

33
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,840
But you know, I guess the question I have to the audience, is it such a bad pill to

34
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:32,840
swallow to use a web app if it means long-term better technology will be used?

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,560
Microsoft notes, quote, Teams PWA is an evolution of our Linux web experience.

36
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,560
It offers the best of the web with key functionalities of client.

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,400
Things like zero install, lightweight, and a rich set of features.

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,400
But it's still in a web browser, which is a deal breaker for some, and has led to a

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,240
sizable amount of online pushback.

40
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,660
Maybe this will accelerate Microsoft's Linux port of WebView2, and they do currently list

41
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,020
that as a major update they plan for the future.

42
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:17,260
But in the meantime, I'm afraid your web app is now a web app.

43
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,880
Arch users took another one in the face this week, so the rest of the Linux world doesn't

44
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,000
have to.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,400
It seems a recent grub issue impacts many Arch and Arch derivative ties.

46
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,200
This takes a little bit of setup to understand, but it all started when some grub developers

47
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,520
were trying to improve support for EFI systems.

48
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:41,600
Specifically a handy dandy menu option that allows users to reboot directly into the system

49
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
firmware.

50
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,240
Maybe you've seen it on your system, in fact.

51
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,000
You've got your Linux Mint entry, you've got your Nix OS entry, and then maybe if your

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,020
system supports it, you've got a little menu entry that just reboots us right into the

53
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,140
BIOS interface.

54
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:01,180
Now before this most recent series of patches to grub, this firmware reboot option was only

55
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:07,560
really available if grub had detected that your system supported it at grub installation

56
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,780
time, not at run time, not at boot time, but whenever you happen to have installed grub.

57
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,840
And this meant that if your system happened to have grub installed when you were booting

58
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,080
via legacy boot, or maybe you'd copied things over, or you'd switched to EFI down the road,

59
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,500
well even if your system supported it, you weren't going to get that option.

60
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,920
To address that, this series of grub updates change that behavior to instead check at run

61
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:37,280
time, see if the system booted through EFI, see if it supported rebooting into the firmware,

62
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,040
and if it did, display the menu entry.

63
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:45,700
Okay, all good, and to do this grub relies on a command known as fw setup.

64
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,740
Now previously this command was only available if UEFI support was found at the installation

65
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,220
time like Wes had said.

66
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,240
As part of these recent updates and patches, grub started using this command in just more

67
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,760
scenarios, and as such, it made it so that, and as such, it was enabled for all installations

68
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,000
rather than only systems where UEFI support had been detected during install.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,800
Unfortunately, the result of all of these different changes meant that on some arch

70
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,920
and arch type systems, after you did a system update, it was possible that your grub configuration

71
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,460
would reflect this new pattern of having fw setup available, but unless you'd intervened

72
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,040
and manually run grub install yourself, or if a friendly package manager out there had

73
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:39,280
done it for you, you might not actually have fw setup available, and that of course could

74
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,460
break your boot.

75
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:47,720
That's not good, nobody wants a broken boot, and the thing is, this was kind of tricky,

76
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,540
maybe nearly impossible to catch in testing, and didn't really get discovered until a larger

77
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:59,280
user base started using it in production, because this issue just simply did not impact

78
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,480
all grub users, it did not impact new installs, and to make things even more problematic,

79
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:11,480
a lot of arch users, especially the cutting edge arch users, aren't even using grub.

80
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:17,140
But you know, it is what it is, and thankfully the issue now has been caught, and if you

81
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,760
wound up with an unbootable system, first of all, thank you for taking it in the face

82
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:25,760
so we don't have to, and second of all, we have what seems to be the most popular fix

83
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,720
linked in our show notes.

84
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:39,120
It's been a few releases since we last highlighted a new Pipewire release, but 0357 just shipped

85
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,040
this week with a few fantastic features.

86
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,160
As an Opus fan, I was really happy to see that Pipewire can now send and receive Opus

87
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,300
data over Bluetooth, that's great.

88
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:57,640
But perhaps even better, or at least immediately practical, an AAC decoder was added so that

89
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:03,440
Pipewire can now also function as an A2DP AAC receiver.

90
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,600
That seems really useful for little gadgets you might want to build, turn a Raspberry

91
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,520
Pi into an A2DP receiver.

92
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,200
I can also imagine there's a lot of uses for that in automotive Linux.

93
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,360
And of course, you got the list of always good to see bug fixes every single time.

94
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,680
And like you said, Wes, we don't cover every Pipewire release, but they tend to be so great

95
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,960
that we debate doing so every time.

96
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,280
And this one just got put over the top with those two new features alone.

97
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,320
There's been a lot of improvements to tooling around Pipewire, various module improvements,

98
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,040
and of course, fixes going into Pipewire core.

99
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:42,040
The great thing is, the API and the ABI are compatible with previous releases of Pipewire

100
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:47,400
in the 3 series.

101
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Some big milestones to report this week, starting with Nmap 7.93, the 25th anniversary edition

102
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,720
that's just been released.

103
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:06,040
Gordon Leon, founder and lead Nmap developer wrote, quote, 25 years ago, I released the

104
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,720
first version of Nmap in a Frac article named The Art of Port Scanning.

105
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,880
I never thought I'd still be at it a quarter of a century later.

106
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:23,960
But that's because I also didn't anticipate such a wonderful community of users and contributors

107
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,360
spanning those decades.

108
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,800
You've helped Nmap blossom from a fairly simple port scanner to a full featured network discovery

109
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,580
application trusted by millions of users every day.

110
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,680
So thanks for that.

111
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:49,240
And another milestone is a big happy birthday to SUSE, which turned 30 this week.

112
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,700
And as a gift, we're reminded just what SUSE stands for.

113
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:04,480
It's Software und Systementwicklung, or Software and Systems Development in English.

114
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,080
Linode.com slash LAN, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

115
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,680
It's just a great way to support the show too, because you're getting yourself something,

116
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,640
trying out something cool, supporting the show.

117
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,760
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

118
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,000
It's the best option out there with the best support in the business.

119
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,640
Real humans all the time, every day.

120
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,600
What else is structured like Linode?

121
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,000
Linode's how we run everything we've built, including our new website that builds and

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,080
is published on Linode.

123
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,040
Linode's S3 compatible object storage is how we run the backend for our next cloud storage

124
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,640
so we're not constantly worried about checking disk space and undeleted files and things

125
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
like that.

126
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,640
And Linode is 30 to 50% cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there that just want to adopt

127
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,440
you and basically make you one of their own, assimilate you into the collective.

128
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,600
You will become one with the Borg, but with Linode, resistance is futile.

129
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,500
They can be part of your multi-cloud strategy since they are 30 to 50% cheaper after all.

130
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,080
So go build something, go learn something, go try one of their 11 data centers around

131
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
the world.

132
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,220
Maybe their cloud firewall, their simple backups, or their Kubernetes support.

133
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,840
Go try it for yourself and support the show.

134
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:19,160
So go to Linode.com slash LAN, get that $100 in 60 day credit and kick the tires for yourself.

135
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,960
There's a reason they've been around for a long time on this show.

136
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,520
Our listeners love Linode.

137
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,040
I know you will too.

138
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,580
So go support the show and try it out.

139
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:33,520
One more time, Linode.com slash LAN.

140
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,400
Collide.com slash LAN.

141
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,320
Collide is endpoint security that uses the most powerful untapped resource in IT.

142
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,640
It's end users.

143
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,120
So if you're trying to achieve security goals for yourself or a third party audit, maybe

144
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,000
the new boss, whatever it is, the conventional wisdom in the past would have been to deploy

145
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,840
some sort of device management software, lock every device down like it's Fort Knox, employ

146
00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:00,580
these policies from afar, and of course put a little performance overhead on their system,

147
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:06,480
introduce possible new points of security vulnerabilities and end users hate it.

148
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,580
Well, Collide does things differently.

149
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,640
Instead of forcing changes on the users, Collide sends them security recommendations via Slack.

150
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,280
Collide will automatically notify your team when their devices are insecure and give them

151
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,140
a step-by-step instruction on how to solve that problem.

152
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,960
And by reaching out to employees via a friendly Slack DM and then educating them about company

153
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,960
policies, Collide can help you build a culture in which everyone contributes to security

154
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,680
because everyone understands how and why to do it.

155
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,360
And for IT admins, Collide provides a single dashboard that lets you monitor the security

156
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,120
of your entire fleet, whether they're running on a Mac, Windows, or yeah, you bet, Linux.

157
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,120
You can see at a glance which employees have their disencrypted, their OS up to date, and

158
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,040
a password manager installed, making it easy to prove compliance to your auditors, customers,

159
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,040

169
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,720
For our last story this week, we're going underwater.

170
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,440
Subsea Cloud, a company proposing to put commercial data centers in deep ocean waters, has moved

171
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,960
closer to a physical launch.

172
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:55,600
The company plans to install a pod near Port Angeles in Washington state.

173
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,880
That very first pod will start with a 20-foot shipping container at around 30 feet underwater,

174
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:10,000
holding 800 servers, although eventually hoping to scale that operation to 100 such pods.

175
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,280
This might sound familiar because another local company tried this before.

176
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,480
Microsoft wrapped up a multi-year experiment in 2020.

177
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,360
The overarching goal of Project Natick is to evaluate the feasibility of underwater

178
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,360
data centers.

179
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,040
Phase one was just to be able to figure out can we get computers into a container and

180
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,840
can we deploy them in the water without it leaking and do the computers survive and how

181
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,320
well do they last.

182
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:41,680
Phase two was to show that we can make it in a manufacturable production scale component.

183
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,000
So the container behind me, it fits on a trailer, it fits on a cargo ship and it allows us to

184
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,680
actually build up this data center to any size that we want.

185
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,240
And Microsoft's tests found the underwater data center had a lower failure rate than

186
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,400
the identical test unit on land.

187
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,440
So far as we've been monitoring this and the data center that we have on land that are

188
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,520
using the same components, we see one-eighth the failure rate in the ocean data center

189
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,280
than we do on land.

190
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,520
Now Microsoft attributes that difference in failure rate primarily to just the very stable

191
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:23,160
temperatures and humidity conditions under the sea, but also, frankly, no humans to make

192
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,540
mistakes and bump things plays a factor as well.

193
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:32,560
But unlike Microsoft, Subsea Cloud does not use a pressure vessel, instead it uses a more

194
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,740
conventional shipping container with pressure equalized between the inside and outside.

195
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,240
That not only lowers costs, but it actually turns out to be more effective in dissipating

196
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,720
thermal load as well.

197
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,560
And now Subsea Cloud wants to commercialize this idea, so the company is starting small,

198
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,360
both in scope and depth.

199
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,320
That first data center pod in Port Angeles will be known as Jules Verne.

200
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,600
Inside Jules Verne, there's space for about 16 standard issue data center racks, accommodating

201
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,000
about 800 servers.

202
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,140
Additional capacity, if and when required, is delivered by just adding another pod.

203
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,440
And don't worry, they're not skimping on the connection.

204
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,400
The pod to shore link in this deployment provides 100 gigabits.

205
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:23,640
I can't help but kind of love this idea because as a sysadmin, as a, as a deployer, you get

206
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,180
to pick and choose what goes into the pod.

207
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,180
It's your systems.

208
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:34,560
And you get an idea of that from the Subsea CEO Maxi Reynolds, who says, quote, data center

209
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,580
space rental is similar to just leasing an office space.

210
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,080
Our leasable spaces provide our tenants network connections, stable power supply, cooling

211
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,680
and security systems.

212
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,320
And then she goes on to say, quote, we ensure the facility is capable of providing the required

213
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,380
IT services when being underwater.

214
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,120
We build, deploy and maintain the Subsea data centers.

215
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,640
And you just know there's not going to be very many Windows boxes down there.

216
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,600
Nobody wants Windows underwater.

217
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,340
Maybe like us, though, you're wondering what the environmental impact of an underwater

218
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,120
data center might be.

219
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,440
Well, both Microsoft and Subsea Cloud say it's a net positive.

220
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,280
According to Subsea, there are significant savings in electrical use, which matters because

221
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:23,320
at three percent of the global electricity supply, data centers have the same carbon

222
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,280
footprint as the aviation industry.

223
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:32,160
Subsea claims their data centers reduce the typical CO2 a traditional data center emits

224
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,480
by 40 percent.

225
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:40,000
Forty percent at scale is a massive difference.

226
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,680
And for one thing, that's achieved because there's no air conditioning and the entire

227
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,440
thing is passively cooled.

228
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,220
That's massive right there.

229
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,640
The other thing is they don't use any water.

230
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:55,920
In fact, the focus is keeping water out.

231
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,200
Inside the servers are also immersed in a dielectric coolant, an oil which conducts

232
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:06,020
heat but not electricity, and the Subsea pods are designed to passively disperse heat rather

233
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:11,200
than using pumps to move the oil around, which you typically would see in a land-based immersion

234
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
cooling system.

235
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,320
And I think what's kind of tragic and ironic about land-based data centers, you know, all

236
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,920
of them, is that they actually use millions of gallons of water a day.

237
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,080
And studies have shown that over half of that water is estimated to be potable water.

238
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,240
The Subsea data center uses no water.

239
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,960
But what happens if something goes wrong, or a customer wants to replace one of their

240
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
servers?

241
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,880
Well, according to Subsea, customers can schedule periodic maintenance, including server replacement,

242
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,100
and they say it should take between 4 to 16 hours for a team to get to the site, bring

243
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,740
up the required pod or pods, and then replace any equipment.

244
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,640
As for the lifespan of these underwater server rooms though, Subsea says the lifespan of

245
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,960
the actual data center pod itself, the environment containing the servers, that should be around

246
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,600
20 years.

247
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,440
But of course, in line with a typical server lifespan and deployment, each pod would likely

248
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,480
live on the seafloor for 3 to 5 years, as they're going to need to rotate the hardware

249
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,940
in and out to keep up with the times.

250
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,540
And Subsea says they build this with one or two failures being totally fine and they can

251
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,680
continue on, but yeah, they have to build it so they can pull it out.

252
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,680
And when they pull it out, they also have to drain it of all of that oil.

253
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,440
So it's a big job.

254
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,520
Subsea hopes that Jules Verne is going to kind of prove all of this stuff out for customers,

255
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,040
and maybe attract the attention of some of the big hyperscalers out there.

256
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,440
I think that's one of their strategies.

257
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,820
It seems that this is really all just a first step, with deployments in the Gulf of Mexico

258
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,240
and other locations already being considered, but we can't help find the entire idea of

259
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,520
Linux Underwater totally fascinating.

260
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,720
We'll keep an eye on it, see where it goes.
