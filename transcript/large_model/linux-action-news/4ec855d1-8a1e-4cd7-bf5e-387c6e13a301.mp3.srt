00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,320
This is episode 42, recorded on February 25th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,320
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,320
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,320
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,320
It's good to be connected with you again today, and I'm pretty excited to announce that a

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,360
new version of Lineage, version 15.1, is finally here.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,040
Yeah, it's been in the works for an awfully long time, but now it is finally here and

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,220
stable.

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,620
So this is based on Android 8.1 Oreo.

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,560
They skipped 8 and went straight to 8.1.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,520
And it's only available for a few devices, but let's look down that list there.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,080
Oh, yes, 1 plus 3T.

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
Sweet.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
I'll be getting this.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,160
Very nice.

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,660
Actually, what I really like about Lineage, even as a non-user, is 15.1 introduces the

18
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,880
rebase with Project Treble.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:02,080
Yeah, that's a lot of why it's only on certain devices, because it's very difficult.

20
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,840
This has been one of the hardest changes for them to move from 14.1 to 15.1, because of

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,560
all this Project Treble stuff.

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,720
And that means that this launch of 15.1 is only with a select number of devices, but

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,400
they do say they are working on the other ones.

24
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,240
And fingers crossed, because I've got some pretty old legacy devices at this point, like

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,800
the old Nexus 7, which is still a great tablet.

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,920
So I'm looking forward to hopefully getting 15.1 running on that at some point.

27
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Yeah, absolutely.

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,980
I mean, think about this.

29
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,120
Think about the context of this.

30
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,200
This project has really grown.

31
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:40,240
It supports over 180 devices, which reaches 1.8 million users and has over 700 contributors.

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,840
So when they rebase using Project Treble, it is a rework that really positions them

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,040
to support future devices way, way, way down the road.

34
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,880
So they kind of had to eat that crap sandwich for this release, and it took a long time,

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,080
and it meant supporting less devices.

36
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,560
But long term, I think it means they could actually integrate future versions of Android

37
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,200
and support a wider range of hardware a lot faster.

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,560
Well, that's the promise of Project Treble, isn't it?

39
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,240
And I'm really hoping that you're right there, because I really rely on lineage at this point.

40
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,280
I just cannot be doing with stock ROMs anymore.

41
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,600
I haven't for a long time.

42
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,480
I wouldn't buy a device that's not supported by lineage.

43
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,280
I think that says everything right there.

44
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,160
And the other thing that happened in this release that I think is going to be good for

45
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,980
future device support is they have an official device support requirements charter now.

46
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,160
It's a document which outlines all of the requirements that a build of lineage OS and

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,040
its maintainer must meet in order to be determined, quote unquote, official.

48
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,880
Yeah, obviously there are a number of unofficial builds knocking around XDA, and they can be

49
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,080
a little bit ropey sometimes, like Wi-Fi not working or cellular or whatever.

50
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,760
Whereas now official devices, you know there is a certain list of criteria they must meet,

51
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,240
and therefore these ROMs are going to actually work properly.

52
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,800
And I'm surprised that it's taken them this long to put that in place really, because

53
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,800
it's good to know now, OK, I can put that on someone's phone for them or tablet or whatever,

54
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,980
and you know, OK, it's officially supported.

55
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,980
It's going to work properly.

56
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,980
Yeah.

57
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,720
So this device support requirements charter is pretty simple at this point.

58
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,080
It's not even very long, but it in general ensures that official builds of lineage 15.1

59
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,800
support all basic hardware that is possible, as well as receives patches against any high

60
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,480
profile vulnerabilities.

61
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,480
So you were saying earlier you only buy a device that you know will run lineage.

62
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,560
Well now here's an actual charter to check off compatibility and say, yep, it meets the

63
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
charter requirements.

64
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,760
Yeah, and that security update thing is a major factor for me, knowing that it's not

65
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,600
going to be just abandoned.

66
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,680
And that's one of the greatest things about custom ROMs, isn't it, that you get these

67
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,920
devices that are abandoned by the OEM, and then the good people at lineage or other ROMs

68
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,360
pick it up and actually back port security fixes to it, and so you're not just left high

69
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
and dry.

70
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,680
Well, if you're like me and Android isn't quite your cup of tea, I've got my Nexus 6P

71
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,360
and I love it, but it's never really hit that perfect spot for me.

72
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,160
I've followed the UBports project with a special amount of interest, my plan B, if you will.

73
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,480
And this week, they have some news, but I don't believe it's on the phone.

74
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,800
Yeah, this is about Unity 8, which as we know, Canonical abandoned the development of back

75
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,820
in April last year.

76
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:29,880
And it kind of limped on as unit, Unity with a Y, but that seems to have come to an end,

77
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,200
that project, it kind of never went anywhere.

78
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:39,320
So now UBports are kind of officially taking on responsibility for keeping it going.

79
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,100
And there is a way to get it running on Ubuntu 18.04.

80
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,120
So if you did like where they were going with this Qt based version of Unity, then you can

81
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,640
at least test it out.

82
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,800
I'll admit this has me scratching my head a bit.

83
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,280
The plasma desktop is sort of the premier Qt environment, but I can see it if you're

84
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,080
really going for that vision of convergence.

85
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,160
Well, yeah, exactly.

86
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,960
They kind of have to keep Unity 8 going if they want to have convergence working at some

87
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
point.

88
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,800
So let's face it, this is very alpha at this point.

89
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
The desktop works, but no X applications work.

90
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,600
It's not really a usable daily driver.

91
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,760
You're not going to get any serious work done with it.

92
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,920
And they have to keep it on the back burner because they're concentrating on making the

93
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,360
actual Ubuntu Touch phone operating system for now.

94
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,560
But once they get that to a point where it's seriously usable with the inbox stuff running

95
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,840
Android applications, the logical next step for them would be to get convergence working.

96
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,640
And they can't really abandon Unity 8 and just totally shelve it.

97
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,760
They have to keep it ticking over.

98
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,480
And this seems a good way as any, make sure it's working on 18.04 and get people testing

99
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
it.

100
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,440
But I don't think they're investing masses of resources into it.

101
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,040
I don't think it's for me yet, Joe.

102
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,840
But I am supremely interested to see how far they can take this thing because all of the

103
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,600
fundamentals are actually there and some of the hard work has been done.

104
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,200
So how far can the UBports take this thing?

105
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
That's what I'll be watching.

106
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,860
Yeah, I feel like they're sort of quietly beavering away.

107
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,120
We talk a lot about what Purism are doing with their phone and everything, but I think

108
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,520
the last man standing when it comes to alternatives to Android that are based on Linux might well

109
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,200
end up being Ubuntu Touch because it's a community project.

110
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,620
It's not backed by some huge company.

111
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,360
They don't have to make it amazing, they just have to have enough donations coming in to

112
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
keep it going.

113
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,600
And I think it's going to tick away and tick away and tick away.

114
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,360
And I don't know, I just have a lot of confidence in it long term.

115
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:47,080
Not being this huge Android iOS competitor that's going to have normal people using it.

116
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,240
But I think that it's going to find its niche long term and it's going to get to a point

117
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,080
where people who want a proper Linux box in their pocket will be able to use it.

118
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,840
And we're going to have convergence as part of that.

119
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,400
And it's a long way off, but we need things like them working on Unity 8 to be part of

120
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,440
that grand vision long term.

121
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,440
I agree.

122
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,720
And that's an interesting observation that perhaps it requires an open source project

123
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,080
that can just tool away at it for maybe a decade to nail this thing.

124
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,720
And that's what it'll take to unseat the entrenched interest.

125
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,360
That's an interesting idea and it makes me a bigger fan of the UbiPorts project overall.

126
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,000
And this is an indication of where they're going long term.

127
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,680
It's really long term about convergence.

128
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,800
And maybe it'll help them get there a little faster and a little easier if they have some

129
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,240
real data to base some decisions off of.

130
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,120
Yeah, so this is something we talked about last week, how Canonical want to collect some

131
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,840
metrics on Ubuntu users and that that is going to be opt out.

132
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,120
The checkbox is going to be on by default and we covered the controversy about that.

133
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:01,080
Well, they've cleared up one question this week and that is people upgrading to 18.04.

134
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,080
That's going to be opt in.

135
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,600
You're going to have to, once you've gone through the upgrade process, go in and actively

136
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,040
opt into that.

137
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:13,040
Although there is talk of trying to find an elegant way to prompt users during the update,

138
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,180
but not that confident about that, I'm afraid.

139
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,520
It's called an end curses interface, my friend, and it's wonderful.

140
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,880
And I think they should do it.

141
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,800
I've talked to both Dustin Kirkland and Will Cook directly in last week's Linux Unplugged

142
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,000
and got all of my questions answered.

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,560
And some of the things that people have been worried about, like location tracking, they

144
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,200
are not even getting down beyond just the country that you're in.

145
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,200
I'm all about this.

146
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,320
I think if they can figure out what packages are used more, what applications crash more,

147
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,960
and the most common types of hardware setups that people have, then not only does Ubuntu

148
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,880
get better, but all of the downstream distributions get better.

149
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,440
Yeah, I can kind of see it, but I really hope that Canonical and the people working there

150
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,240
have read Stuart Langridge's blog post about this.

151
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,800
He didn't call out Ubuntu specifically, but the timing of it is clearly not a coincidence.

152
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,800
And it's entitled Collecting User Data While Protecting User Privacy.

153
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,520
And he talks a lot about data science and aggregation and stuff.

154
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,200
And one of the key points in it that I'd never really thought about, because I don't really

155
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:23,480
think much about data science, is that you can collect data in a way that totally anonymizes

156
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,120
people by having a certain percentage of those machines reporting false information.

157
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
Yeah, they lie.

158
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,300
Well, that's the thing.

159
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,600
If you know that 20% of the users that are reporting data back to you or users machines

160
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,360
that are reporting back to you are reporting slightly false information, it averages out

161
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,680
to give you essentially the same statistical data, but everyone is completely anonymous

162
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,480
because you don't know whether their machine lied to you or not.

163
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,960
Right, so in aggregate, the stats are actually fairly accurate.

164
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:01,100
Yeah, and this only works if you are truly interested in just statistical analysis like

165
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,320
Canonical say they are.

166
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,400
If you're a company who is trying to track people and do evil stuff, then this becomes

167
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,680
absolutely useless to you.

168
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,240
So let's hope that they actually do something like this and prove everyone wrong that they

169
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,880
are only interested in the statistics.

170
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,600
This reminds me of the collection of data model that Apple claims that they supposedly

171
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,800
implement called differential privacy.

172
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
And it's essentially this.

173
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,960
Well, you would hope that it would be an industry standard at this point.

174
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,520
And that's why last week when we talked about this, I said that I really want them to open

175
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,860
source their back end technology that is analyzing this data.

176
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:43,000
Because if it does turn out that they are doing this, then I think a lot of people are

177
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:50,880
going to be far more relaxed about it and will go far easier on them.

178
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
Digitalocean.com.

179
00:10:51,880 --> 00:11:00,760
In fact, even better for a limited time, go to do.co action and get a $100 credit at Digital

180
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
Ocean.

181
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,480
New accounts only, but this is the perfect opportunity to try out Digital Ocean.

182
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,560
Digital Ocean is infrastructure that you can spin up on demand.

183
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,720
Everything is on SSDs, and they're resizable depending on your requirements.

184
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,160
You select the region, they have eight data centers all over the world, and then you go.

185
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,440
Now they have standard droplets.

186
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,840
Those have gotten even better, more competitive, the price is even lower.

187
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,440
But what I love are the flexible droplets.

188
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,560
For around $15 a month, you mix and match everything to what your application needs.

189
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,680
do.co action to get in on that $100 credit.

190
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,120
They have the best dashboard, ready to go applications.

191
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,720
You can employ an entire GitLab stack with a single click, bam, that gets deployed on

192
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,080
the Digital Ocean droplet.

193
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:48,000
Or you can build a system all the way up from the ground up using CoreOS or Fedora or FreeBSD

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,760
or Debian or Ubuntu.

195
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,560
Whatever you like, you can deploy it on Digital Ocean.

196
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,640
Then you use their great dashboard, their API, or whatever floats your boat.

197
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Digitalocean.com.

198
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:05,440
Better than that, do.co action.

199
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,840
Excellent news for the Signal project this week.

200
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:14,240
They now have a foundation thanks to a $50 million cash injection by Brian Acton, who

201
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,560
was one of the co-founders of WhatsApp.

202
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,840
So that's got to be good news for user privacy and encrypted messaging.

203
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,280
Yeah, over on the Signal blog, they talk about all of the things they can do now.

204
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,760
They say they can increase the size of their team, their capacity, and their ambitions.

205
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,280
And it means it reduces the uncertainty on the path to sustainability.

206
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,120
And there is a bit of a tone that comes across in this blog post from Moxie himself.

207
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,720
And the tone is, we haven't gotten to where we want to be yet.

208
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,800
We wanted to be more competitive by this point.

209
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,440
But by sticking to our ideals and not taking any VC funding, we haven't been able to really

210
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,600
keep up with the telegrams and the other messaging platforms of the world.

211
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,800
And maybe now, with $50 million of funding into a foundation, we'll begin to build the

212
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,240
runway to do that.

213
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,080
But this WhatsApp connection, again, WhatsApp uses the Signal protocol, doesn't it, for

214
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,860
the encryption.

215
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,640
And yet they don't contribute back any changes because they've got some weird license agreement.

216
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,540
I've always found it very strange, this relationship that they have.

217
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:25,920
And that's further complicated by Brian Acton, who was one of the co-founders, actually giving

218
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,360
them this money to do it.

219
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,560
It's all a bit strange, isn't it?

220
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,120
What's even more interesting, Joe, is that Moxie writes in this blog post, he says, perhaps

221
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,140
most significantly, the addition of Brian brings an incredibly talented engineer and

222
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,200
visionary with decades of experience to our products team.

223
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,280
Like, Brian Acton's going to take an active role in the development of Signal.

224
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,880
Well, he's certainly very successful, isn't he?

225
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,400
And he must be a good engineer.

226
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,320
So this has got to be good news for Signal.

227
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,360
I mean, I don't know anyone who doesn't use WhatsApp in this country.

228
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
I know it's not that popular over there, but here it is huge.

229
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,060
I do think it's popular in the States among a certain demo, but yeah, from just the conversations

230
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,680
you and I have had offline, it doesn't sound like it's quite as popular.

231
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,860
But it is a well-known name.

232
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,200
And that's a big deal in this market.

233
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:20,900
When you combine the funding through this foundation, the name of Brian Acton and his

234
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:27,200
experience and the name of Moxie, long, long term, 10 years down the road, I would bet

235
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:31,860
all of the Bitcoin on Signal and not so much on Telegram or other, quote unquote, secure

236
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,040
messaging programs.

237
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,880
Yeah, it makes me kind of tempted to give it a go, really, that now I know they're going

238
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,960
to have some investment here and develop well, and hopefully they can trigger some sort of

239
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:47,960
network effect with this because it's not really much use if no one else is using it,

240
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,960
is it?

241
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,840
And I don't know that many people using Signal, whereas everyone seems to use either WhatsApp

242
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,320
or Telegram at this point.

243
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,960
I mean, there's some people I still talk to on Hangouts.

244
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,240
Do I need another messenger at this point?

245
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,040
I'm not sure you do, but you do need another CPU architecture.

246
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,520
Yeah, RISC-V, which is the completely open CPU architecture.

247
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:14,800
Now there's a seriously good dev board available for pre-order, but it's going to be shipping

248
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,360
soon.

249
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,320
And this is called the Hi5 Unleashed, and this is from a company called Psi5.

250
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:27,440
And it was kind of a weird crowdfunder on CrowdSupply where it was $1 was their goal.

251
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,460
So it's really just using CrowdSupply to process the payments, really.

252
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:38,200
And they've raised $117,000, but here's the kicker.

253
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,340
It's $999, okay?

254
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,860
It's got eight gigabytes of RAM.

255
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,920
It's a decent board, but I remember we talked about at Christmas, my hopes were that we

256
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,720
were going to get a Raspberry Pi competitor based on RISC-V. And okay, this is kind of

257
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,680
of that ilk, but this is no Raspberry Pi competitor at nearly $1,000.

258
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,720
999 US greenbacks, eight gigabytes of RAM on that sucker, right?

259
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,320
Eight gigabytes of RAM, a micro SD card slot, it has an expansion port, and you've got that

260
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,860
essential five-core.

261
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,680
It's four cores of high-performance CPUs and one low-performance CPU.

262
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,100
So it's, I say essentially five-core, it's really four usable cores and then like a low-power

263
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,600
core.

264
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,720
And they're going to start shipping this thing March 2018.

265
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,760
I can't afford this, Elon Musk might be able to afford this.

266
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:37,460
If this could get in the price range of $100, I think even around there, even close to $100,

267
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,720
it's a great buy.

268
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,020
Yeah, this is a very limited run.

269
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,760
It's the first run.

270
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:50,040
It's for developers and people who want to back this whole movement towards a totally

271
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,440
free architecture.

272
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,680
It's not for people who want to tinker on the weekends.

273
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,220
It's for people who are full-time invested in this stuff.

274
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,320
And once they can expand the production run, the price is hopefully going to drop significantly.

275
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,600
And it's clearly popular.

276
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,760
There's a hundred people have backed this, which, okay, it's not that many, but it's

277
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,880
a hundred thousand dollars plus that's gone into it.

278
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,040
So it shows that there is a market for this.

279
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,760
People do care about a completely open architecture.

280
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,400
I really want to see the benchmarks on this and how it compares to ARM because it's not

281
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,880
going to compete with x86.

282
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:36,000
That's quite clear, but how does it compare to ARM CPUs of a similar power draw and similar

283
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,800
frequency, that sort of thing.

284
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,880
I said it at Christmas and I'm saying it now.

285
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,040
We need this to be good and we need people to invest in it.

286
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:50,940
And already there's a Fedora image for RISC-V that hopefully will work on this device.

287
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,320
The whole RISC-V platform and building system on a chips that are completely free and open

288
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,440
to run Linux is one of the stories that is going to be really fascinating to follow throughout

289
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,040
2018.

290
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,280
Find a link to the video of the launch at linuxactionnews.com slash 42.

291
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,680
In fact, links to everything we've talked about today, linuxactionnews.com slash 42,

292
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,700
but specifically I linked in there the FOSDEM link.

293
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,880
It goes right to the MP4 of the launch of the HIFive.

294
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,800
Yeah, hopefully a big year for RISC-V and freedom in general.

295
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:27,080
And it's also a big year for comebacks, by the looks of things.

296
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,680
Tech Talk Today's back?

297
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Surely not.

298
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,840
I couldn't help myself.

299
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,240
Tech Talk Today, techtalk.today slash 261, the launch.

300
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,960
Yeah, I'm bringing it back for 10 episodes.

301
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,120
I thought it'd be fun to do a limited run because when we launch podcasts, we always

302
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,160
just go indefinitely forever.

303
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,120
So what if I launched a podcast and I said I'm only doing 10 episodes?

304
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,580
So for those people who have never heard Tech Talk Today, what's it all about?

305
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,820
It's really taking a look at the news in technology of the day from the perspective of the open

306
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:02,000
source community outside the Silicon Valley bubble with a broader understanding of technology

307
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,560
and its impact on our privacy, our security, monitoring us.

308
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,800
A lot of times, it's not that there aren't other tech shows.

309
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:14,740
They're just really super focused on smartphones and all of the cool stuff coming out of California.

310
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,040
And I have the advantage of being outside that bubble and in the open source community.

311
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,680
So it's looking with that perspective, trying to tell a story, tell everybody something

312
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,120
interesting, get them caught up on the news that matters.

313
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,480
And while I'm going down to scale, the story of going to scale, interacting with the Linux

314
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,480
community.

315
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,840
And if I could be so lucky, where the hell Linux is going in 2018?

316
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,720
I want to try to include all of that in season one of Tech Talk Today.

317
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,000
That's an awful lot to pack into 10 episodes, so I look forward to listening to the next

318
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
nine.

319
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yeah.
