Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.500 --> 00:20.840
This is episode 8, recorded on July 2nd, 2017, and I'm Chris.

00:20.840 --> 00:21.840
And I'm Joe.

00:21.840 --> 00:26.880
Hello Joe, we have a great lineup of news and finally some details on a story we covered

00:26.880 --> 00:29.480
towards the very beginning of this show.

00:29.480 --> 00:34.880
OpenSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise have hit the Windows Store, yeah I said the Windows

00:34.880 --> 00:35.880
Store.

00:35.880 --> 00:40.680
Yeah so the Windows subsystem for Linux is now not just Ubuntu officially, now you've

00:40.680 --> 00:46.640
got OpenSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise, which totally makes sense doesn't it because this

00:46.640 --> 00:52.360
is really aimed at developers and people and you know sysadmins and that kind of thing.

00:52.360 --> 00:59.360
So you're going to expect it to be the more corporate distros, so I'm just waiting for

00:59.360 --> 01:01.800
RHEL which we haven't got any word on yet.

01:01.800 --> 01:06.560
Fedora is supposed to be coming soon, but I think it would make a lot of sense to get

01:06.560 --> 01:09.240
well at least CentOS on there.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.320
I was just thinking that, I wonder if the project could take that on or if Microsoft

01:12.320 --> 01:13.480
could help them.

01:13.480 --> 01:18.400
Definitely the SUSE Enterprise server is, that clicks for me, that makes a lot of sense

01:18.400 --> 01:22.280
and you will need to be a member of the Windows Insider program to get this.

01:22.280 --> 01:27.640
I think you have to be running preview build 16, 190 or later to get this.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.960
And also just a caveat, I think this is a prop, maybe it will be fixed by the time this

01:30.960 --> 01:38.000
episode goes out, but in the Windows Store there are screenshots of the X desktop for

01:38.000 --> 01:39.000
SUSE.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.600
Yeah which is confusing isn't it.

01:40.600 --> 01:44.840
No you don't get that, you get bash when you install SUSE and you still also have to first

01:44.840 --> 01:48.560
install the Linux subsystem, but you know a couple of quick things, you can sign up

01:48.560 --> 01:52.520
for the Insider program pretty quickly and then you could match your production now on

01:52.520 --> 01:55.720
your Windows 10 box, that's going to matter for a lot of people.

01:55.720 --> 02:00.760
Yeah and you can of course hack it so you can install X server and stuff and make it

02:00.760 --> 02:02.640
work but that's not officially supported.

02:02.640 --> 02:07.800
Yeah well I suppose that would almost be worth me loading a Windows 10 machine just to mess

02:07.800 --> 02:13.160
around with because I remember the days of Cygwin Joe and this is a whole other breed.

02:13.160 --> 02:17.960
I actually am really impressed with what Microsoft is doing here and it's cool to see SUSE actually

02:17.960 --> 02:18.960
get it in there.

02:18.960 --> 02:22.160
I was a little surprised it took publishing to the Windows Store for us to really find

02:22.160 --> 02:25.440
out what versions of SUSE we get to try, but now we know.

02:25.440 --> 02:29.600
Yeah especially as I actually spoke to Richard about this, Richard Brown, the chairman of

02:29.600 --> 02:36.320
OpenSUSE and still he didn't know and that was maybe three weeks ago, four weeks ago,

02:36.320 --> 02:41.320
so I don't really understand why it's happened like this but well here we are, we've gotten

02:41.320 --> 02:47.080
both so just wait for Fedora and maybe Arch at one point but I'm not holding my breath

02:47.080 --> 02:48.080
for that.

02:48.080 --> 02:53.480
I wouldn't hold my breath for Pop OS either, that's System76's new operating system, don't

02:53.480 --> 02:59.000
call it a distribution, they announced it this week, Pop OS based on Ubuntu 17.04 using

02:59.000 --> 03:00.720
the GNOME desktop environment.

03:00.720 --> 03:03.720
You mean Pop exclamation mark underscore OS.

03:03.720 --> 03:07.120
Yes I do, it's kind of hard to say that, I'm not sure and I'm not sure if the acronym is

03:07.120 --> 03:11.960
supposed to be POS or if it's just POP, maybe it's just supposed to be POP, those are all

03:11.960 --> 03:17.080
things we haven't learned yet because we're all too busy trying to figure out what just

03:17.080 --> 03:18.080
happened.

03:18.080 --> 03:21.880
Well I think there's quite a few people who think it's a POS but let's not go there, eh?

03:21.880 --> 03:26.120
You know I've been trying to figure out how do people generally feel about this and I'm

03:26.120 --> 03:30.720
honestly getting the sense from System76's own customer base, their existing base, they

03:30.720 --> 03:32.760
seem kind of fired up about this.

03:32.760 --> 03:36.880
Now people outside of that ecosystem seem to be extremely skeptical.

03:36.880 --> 03:43.480
Yeah skeptical to say the least really, I've seen a lot of negativity on Reddit, in the

03:43.480 --> 03:51.000
Telegram channels, it just seems that the wider community as you say are not, they just

03:51.000 --> 03:56.120
keep asking the question why, you guys were talking about this on User Error and it just

03:56.120 --> 03:59.800
keeps coming back to that question, why, why have they done this?

03:59.800 --> 04:06.260
But I suppose yeah the only positivity I've seen is yeah from the existing System76 community

04:06.260 --> 04:13.960
not from the wider Linux community because the wider community sees this as duplicated

04:13.960 --> 04:18.440
effort because they've based it on Ubuntu and right now we've got this alpha which is

04:18.440 --> 04:25.040
based on Ubuntu GNOME 17.04 and really apart from a theme and some extensions there's not

04:25.040 --> 04:26.920
really much to differentiate it.

04:26.920 --> 04:32.760
Yeah not yet, I would be interested to see if they eventually deviate in like release

04:32.760 --> 04:36.520
cadence and pre-installed software more and more.

04:36.520 --> 04:41.600
There's also the question if they're going to become an official Ubuntu flavor and I

04:41.600 --> 04:44.280
think that's a pretty important question.

04:44.280 --> 04:50.400
There's a big trademark issue lingering here now because they're using the Ubuntu repos

04:50.400 --> 04:54.880
and a lot of the software packages that are being installed have Ubuntu in the name, Ubuntu

04:54.880 --> 05:01.020
in some of the build notes, that could lead to a potential trademark issue, something

05:01.020 --> 05:05.900
that Mint is somewhat familiar with especially because they'll be using the same repos where

05:05.900 --> 05:10.320
if they become a flavor it essentially resolves these issues plus they get popped into the

05:10.320 --> 05:13.040
support infrastructure for the other Ubuntu flavors.

05:13.040 --> 05:18.120
But it's not clear to me exactly what restrictions would be placed on them by becoming an official

05:18.120 --> 05:19.120
flavor.

05:19.120 --> 05:23.600
Well I think that that is la la land dream thinking really, it's not going to happen.

05:23.600 --> 05:29.240
I can't see that Canonical would be willing to even entertain the idea because it's too

05:29.240 --> 05:30.240
similar.

05:30.240 --> 05:34.880
All of the other flavors have something that differentiates them whether it's an XFCE or

05:34.880 --> 05:39.780
Marte desktop or whatever but if you've just got a GNOME desktop with a different theme,

05:39.780 --> 05:42.480
how is that different enough to warrant it being a flavor?

05:42.480 --> 05:45.200
There just seems no way that that's going to happen to me.

05:45.200 --> 05:49.600
To tell you the truth Joe, if I was Carl at System76 I'd probably be willing to make some

05:49.600 --> 05:52.320
concessions to become an official flavor.

05:52.320 --> 05:55.360
If they don't, they're going to end up in a situation I believe where they're going

05:55.360 --> 06:02.560
to have to offer both OS choices at purchase time, Ubuntu LTS or Pop OS.

06:02.560 --> 06:07.040
The people buying System76 hardware are buying it because it runs Ubuntu really well.

06:07.040 --> 06:11.680
So they either have to be really close in that Ubuntu lineage or they're going to have

06:11.680 --> 06:13.440
to offer Ubuntu proper.

06:13.440 --> 06:18.200
Well yeah but as long as Ubuntu works on it because the big question I have here and I

06:18.200 --> 06:23.360
am not over in the States so I don't really know many people who've got System76 machines

06:23.360 --> 06:29.680
but if I bought one, the first thing I would do is wipe it and put Ubuntu on there and

06:29.680 --> 06:34.920
a lot of people would put Arch or Fedora or whatever because if it works really well with

06:34.920 --> 06:39.640
Ubuntu then the chances are it's going to work with the other.

06:39.640 --> 06:44.240
Exactly, that is almost universally true with some caveats.

06:44.240 --> 06:52.600
System76 bundles a PPA with their machines and that PPA includes fixes and drivers that

06:52.600 --> 06:57.320
often make a system run better and there is some ways to get it on Arch.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.760
I think there's something in the AUR for it.

06:59.760 --> 07:04.200
But if you've got a different Ubuntu flavor like Zubuntu is what I would use then I presume

07:04.200 --> 07:06.280
I could add that PPA manually.

07:06.280 --> 07:11.300
Sure you could but then I think you're beginning to fall outside the spectrum of System76 customer.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.400
Not fully outside of it.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.920
Well that's the question.

07:13.920 --> 07:14.920
That's the question.

07:14.920 --> 07:18.000
Am I outside of that or not?

07:18.000 --> 07:22.160
How many of their customers really wipe it and you can pay as soon as they get it?

07:22.160 --> 07:28.760
From my conversations with both System76 and Dell they are under the impression, probably

07:28.760 --> 07:34.120
based on support calls, that the vast majority leave the stock install and surprising that

07:34.120 --> 07:37.080
both vendors said that to me when I asked them that question.

07:37.080 --> 07:40.440
Because Joe I was thinking the same thing, like that's what I do, I usually put something

07:40.440 --> 07:41.440
else on there.

07:41.440 --> 07:46.400
But they, at least in the terms of their support data show, that customers run what they ship.

07:46.400 --> 07:51.280
Well that would be consistent with basically any other hardware that comes with any operating

07:51.280 --> 07:53.640
system be it phones or computers.

07:53.640 --> 07:58.320
People who buy a Windows machine they think it's broken because Windows is so slow.

07:58.320 --> 08:02.880
They don't even want to use the recovery partition, they don't even know there's a recovery partition.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.640
So people just want an appliance.

08:04.640 --> 08:08.960
But I just can't help but think that the kind of person who would buy a Linux machine would

08:08.960 --> 08:10.320
have a different mindset.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.600
But maybe I'm wrong.

08:11.600 --> 08:15.720
It might matter more in the future because this hardware is getting more sophisticated,

08:15.720 --> 08:20.040
more advanced, it has more specialized features in it like super high resolution screens,

08:20.040 --> 08:21.780
crazy great trackpads.

08:21.780 --> 08:25.240
Perhaps in the future it might have dual batteries and integrated LTE modems, I'm thinking of

08:25.240 --> 08:26.480
the Galago Pro.

08:26.480 --> 08:31.800
And these types of features might require more and more System76's modifications.

08:31.800 --> 08:36.280
So you combine that with user application feedback they're getting from their customer.

08:36.280 --> 08:40.840
Future hardware designs that they perhaps have on the roadmap that have more sophistication

08:40.840 --> 08:44.840
than ever, they might have just arrived at a place where they said, we're going to have

08:44.840 --> 08:48.680
to modify Ubuntu so much to make it work with our stuff that we should really just call

08:48.680 --> 08:50.320
it our own OS.

08:50.320 --> 08:54.780
And that might be something that's really a 2018 reality, but they've got to start the

08:54.780 --> 08:56.840
work in 2017.

08:56.840 --> 09:01.000
Well yeah, and also they're kind of almost going for this Apple approach, aren't they?

09:01.000 --> 09:04.200
In theory of control the hardware and the software, and then you're going to have a

09:04.200 --> 09:05.200
great experience.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.320
Yeah, and it does seem like if anybody was going to be able to integrate hardware and

09:08.320 --> 09:14.600
software it would be a hardware vendor who's got a lot of experience tweaking the end result.

09:14.600 --> 09:17.320
Now here's where I play a little devil's advocate.

09:17.320 --> 09:22.060
At the same time System76 is trying to spin up a massive manufacturing effort, which is

09:22.060 --> 09:26.880
brand new to their company, they're also going to spin up an operating system?

09:26.880 --> 09:28.720
Don't call it a distribution.

09:28.720 --> 09:32.440
And they're making it available to the general public.

09:32.440 --> 09:37.420
So it's not just an OS for their hardware, but it's an OS for quote-unquote creators.

09:37.420 --> 09:42.820
This is two unbelievable, massive endeavors that I can't really think of any other companies

09:42.820 --> 09:46.260
besides one or two that have really pulled this off.

09:46.260 --> 09:50.600
One thing I heard you say on User Error was that if they don't do this right, then it

09:50.600 --> 09:52.640
could be the beginning of the end for them.

09:52.640 --> 09:56.800
And then you kind of got sidetracked, and I'm really keen to know where you were going

09:56.800 --> 09:57.800
with that.

09:57.800 --> 10:02.920
It would really be the unfortunate combination of a series of events, delays in the hardware

10:02.920 --> 10:07.280
manufacturing process, so they have to continue to ship ODM hardware where they have to make

10:07.280 --> 10:12.600
compromises they're not happy with, and then an OS that isn't well received by the community

10:12.600 --> 10:16.600
that doesn't gain a lot of brand traction, sorry to use these terms, but if it doesn't

10:16.600 --> 10:21.320
gain a lot of brand traction, they're going to be delivering slightly underwhelming hardware

10:21.320 --> 10:26.320
with an OS that nobody's really heard of, and that's a super marginalized position to

10:26.320 --> 10:27.320
be in.

10:27.320 --> 10:31.920
But it's also at the same time, if it's successful, would be a really great position to be in.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.040
So I can see their bold logic here.

10:35.040 --> 10:39.260
It's just extremely bold, and I have to be honest with you, the kind of improvement I

10:39.260 --> 10:43.800
would have liked to have seen as an 11-year customer of 76 are things that make using

10:43.800 --> 10:46.240
the machines long term even better.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.240
I'll give you a number one example.

10:48.240 --> 10:54.380
With the XPS line and a few others, Dell has now managed to ship firmware updates via GNOME

10:54.380 --> 10:57.440
Software Center, integrated right in with my Linux desktop.

10:57.440 --> 11:02.000
No more need for FreeDOS or booting into Windows to fix microcode issues.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.320
It's just right there in GNOME Software Center.

11:04.320 --> 11:07.960
It feels like an Apple-level integrated experience.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.120
I would love to see work done on that.

11:10.120 --> 11:13.340
I would love to see pressure applied to the upstream ODM.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.920
These kinds of things would have been more direct, real changes that would improve the

11:16.920 --> 11:20.600
existing immediate product line that would make me want to buy another computer in the

11:20.600 --> 11:21.720
short term.

11:21.720 --> 11:26.660
As it is right now, maybe I'm waiting until 2019, 2020 before I'm going to take another

11:26.660 --> 11:30.360
look at a System76 machine, simply because now I'm going to want to wait to see where

11:30.360 --> 11:32.160
their hardware manufacturing goes and where Pop!

11:32.160 --> 11:33.160
OS goes.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.640
And it's going to take a few years for everything to mature.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.280
Yeah, I think that's all fair, but have you had a look at this yet?

11:38.280 --> 11:39.280
At Pop!

11:39.280 --> 11:40.280
OS?

11:40.280 --> 11:41.280
Yeah.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.280
Yeah, just a bit.

11:42.280 --> 11:43.280
I tossed it in a VM yesterday.

11:43.280 --> 11:44.280
It's quite pretty, isn't it?

11:44.280 --> 11:45.280
It's a little loud.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.320
I find it to be a bit distracting, so I generally go with a more low-key icon theme.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.120
But other than that, yeah, it's actually not bad.

11:50.120 --> 11:53.720
And what I really like is how they're working to take that theme and extend it to other

11:53.720 --> 11:58.400
applications like Telegram and maybe Slack to really make it all feel like it's one desktop.

11:58.400 --> 12:02.960
Yeah, and the extensions that they've chosen to use, I think, are ones that I would if

12:02.960 --> 12:04.880
I was forced to use GNOME.

12:04.880 --> 12:08.400
So it makes it more usable than the kind of stock of Ubuntu GNOME.

12:08.400 --> 12:13.120
So yeah, I think they're going in the right direction with it, but we've just got to see

12:13.120 --> 12:15.960
what the community pushback is going to be, because we're actually going to get a release,

12:15.960 --> 12:19.680
aren't we, around the same time as 17.10 comes out in October.

12:19.680 --> 12:20.680
Yeah.

12:20.680 --> 12:24.200
So, yeah, we'll have to see how good that is.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.460
I could see it working out.

12:25.460 --> 12:30.880
If the community got behind it, if they could work with Canonical, become an official flavor,

12:30.880 --> 12:35.000
and they had the internal resources to pull it off, it could be one of the more interesting

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
flavors of the Ubuntu desktop.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.360
Well, we'll see.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.360
We'll see.

12:39.360 --> 12:44.660
Well, speaking of the Ubuntu desktop, Will Cook has posted about easing the migration

12:44.660 --> 12:46.960
of Unity 7 users to GNOME Shell.

12:46.960 --> 12:51.160
Yeah, we mentioned last week they're separating out the Ubuntu desktop session and the Unity

12:51.160 --> 12:55.200
session so you can have the new GNOME desktop and Unity 7 side by side.

12:55.200 --> 12:59.460
They've also done some work to improve the desktop launchers to make use of the new GNOME

12:59.460 --> 13:02.480
platform snap support, which is actually kind of neat.

13:02.480 --> 13:06.920
So they're going to have like full-fledged fancy snap support in GNOME software, which

13:06.920 --> 13:08.360
is going upstream.

13:08.360 --> 13:11.880
And they're continuing work on the live patch service that we've been talking about recently

13:11.880 --> 13:14.480
to integrate it into the Ubuntu desktop.

13:14.480 --> 13:18.400
And now it looks like the Update Manager utility is capable of displaying the current live

13:18.400 --> 13:22.840
patch status as well as the fixes that are available for installation or those that have

13:22.840 --> 13:23.980
already been applied.

13:23.980 --> 13:27.920
And they're working on a prototype API that will just go fetch the latest information

13:27.920 --> 13:30.000
from the CVE database.

13:30.000 --> 13:34.240
So much for people like me saying that they were totally abandoning the desktop and not

13:34.240 --> 13:35.760
working on it anymore, eh?

13:35.760 --> 13:39.640
Yeah, that's a really nice feature to put in your desktop Update Manager, and it's probably

13:39.640 --> 13:42.040
going to spur a lot of adoption of the live patch service.

13:42.040 --> 13:45.280
Yeah, and it's good to see that this stuff is getting pushed upstream as well.

13:45.280 --> 13:51.040
So what we kind of speculated about that it was going to be good for GNOME as a whole

13:51.040 --> 13:57.520
seems to be coming true already, and we haven't even seen a proper release yet.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.360
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

13:59.360 --> 14:03.540
Go there to sign up for a free seven-day trial and support the show for a platform that has

14:03.540 --> 14:08.800
everything you need to learn and get hands-on experience with Linux topics from the really

14:08.800 --> 14:15.040
low-level stuff all the way up to the cloud stuff like Azure and AWS and OpenStack.

14:15.040 --> 14:19.720
You know, actually, if you need to learn AWS, from my personal experience, I will recommend

14:19.720 --> 14:21.000
Linux Academy.

14:21.000 --> 14:26.040
This was a game changer for me because when I started with trying to learn AWS, I burned

14:26.040 --> 14:29.240
through hours and hours of CPU time.

14:29.240 --> 14:32.560
With Linux Academy, they spin up the systems as you need them on demand.

14:32.560 --> 14:36.240
They have hands-on scenario-based labs that give you real experience and instructor mentoring

14:36.240 --> 14:40.000
when you need it, as well as a core scheduler that works with your busy schedule.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.800
Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

14:45.800 --> 14:50.240
So back when Canonical dropped the bombshell that they were killing convergence and Unity

14:50.240 --> 14:56.440
and all that stuff, we had assumed that Mir was going to be the number one casualty of

14:56.440 --> 15:02.680
that because why do they need Mir anymore if they're going to go to Wayland on GNOME

15:02.680 --> 15:05.120
and they're not going to work on the phones anymore?

15:05.120 --> 15:11.000
Well, it seems that we were wrong about that because they're heading towards Mir 1.0 release,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.040
which is actually going to support Wayland.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.800
Yeah, it was just a flesh wound, Joe.

15:14.800 --> 15:19.000
I did a little digging before the show and it looks like patches have been applied since

15:19.000 --> 15:23.560
the announcements, after the announcements, and it looks like, according to Alan, who's

15:23.560 --> 15:28.040
one of the long, not Alan Jude, but Alan Griffiths, one of the longtime Mir developers, says that

15:28.040 --> 15:33.440
Mir 0.27 is coming soon with a lot of work in progress features that were baking prior

15:33.440 --> 15:36.400
to Canonical shifting their desktop focus.

15:36.400 --> 15:41.520
They're also talking about adding Wayland support, like you were saying, and this could

15:41.520 --> 15:47.100
be huge for different desktops because Mir might just be about to become a compositor

15:47.100 --> 15:48.360
that speaks Wayland.

15:48.360 --> 15:53.840
Yeah, and that means that potentially Marte might be able to take advantage of that and

15:53.840 --> 15:58.400
not have to either roll their own or rely on mutter.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.760
If this sounds a little crazy, well, these are the kind of things that open source enthusiasts

16:01.760 --> 16:04.520
come up with when they're all together in the same room.

16:04.520 --> 16:08.680
They've been at a Snappy Sprint in Canonical's London office and they've been chatting about

16:08.680 --> 16:12.860
Flatpak and Snap integrations with existing GNOME software and stuff, but this came up

16:12.860 --> 16:18.120
on the sidelines and the idea really here was it would take less work to add Wayland

16:18.120 --> 16:26.840
support to Mir than it would to move Mate over to mutter or to build Wayland support

16:26.840 --> 16:29.960
into Marco, its compositor.

16:29.960 --> 16:32.380
To be honest, this has sort of been coming for a little while.

16:32.380 --> 16:36.720
They first moved over to GTK3, but after that, what comes next?

16:36.720 --> 16:40.240
High DPI came, then it becomes Wayland support time.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.960
This is really where they're up against a wall, and Wimpy says it perfectly.

16:42.960 --> 16:47.760
Mr. Wimpris says that, Mate is a very small team with extremely constrained time.

16:47.760 --> 16:52.320
Implementing Wayland directly is at our current development velocity several years away in

16:52.320 --> 16:53.320
his opinion.

16:53.320 --> 16:57.320
He then goes on to say, Mir could provide us a fast path to supporting Wayland.

16:57.320 --> 17:02.740
We should explore it and possibly other desktops without Wayland support as well, like maybe

17:02.740 --> 17:04.240
Joe's beloved XFCE.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.400
Well, whatever makes it work.

17:06.400 --> 17:12.040
The last thing I expected to come to XFCE's rescue is Mir, but yeah, if it happens, it

17:12.040 --> 17:13.040
happens great.

17:13.040 --> 17:19.480
If it means that XFCE can stay relevant and use modern technology, then I'm well up for

17:19.480 --> 17:20.480
it.

17:20.480 --> 17:23.560
I want to be clear about this point because I've read a lot of negative feedback about

17:23.560 --> 17:25.840
this story on the internet already.

17:25.840 --> 17:32.000
If we blow this as a community, we are guaranteed in for a bumpy ride with the transition to

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
Wayland.

17:33.000 --> 17:40.080
Unless some display server magician shows up and writes magic code for every open source

17:40.080 --> 17:44.600
desktop that crops up under the sun that's going to need to speak Wayland, unless that

17:44.600 --> 17:49.220
happens, we're either going to have a massive consolidation of desktops once everybody switches

17:49.220 --> 17:52.920
over to Wayland, and it's only going to be the top projects that can make it work, or

17:52.920 --> 17:57.660
we need a common API for all these other projects to take advantage of, like Mir, that can do

17:57.660 --> 18:02.640
the hard, heavy lifting of talking to Wayland and then provide them a versioned API set

18:02.640 --> 18:04.920
that they can just write their desktop to.

18:04.920 --> 18:08.200
But do you think that there's going to be a bit of pushback against it?

18:08.200 --> 18:09.200
There already is.

18:09.200 --> 18:13.200
Well, do you think it's going to be continued because it's a canonical, not invented here

18:13.200 --> 18:14.200
type deal?

18:14.200 --> 18:15.940
Yes, definitely.

18:15.940 --> 18:19.040
Canonical could make things easier on themselves by putting everything on GitHub, by taking

18:19.040 --> 18:20.640
Launchpad out of it.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.920
I don't know if that's a reality, I don't know if that's possible.

18:22.920 --> 18:26.960
And also, that CLA has to be taken out of the picture as well for people to really double

18:26.960 --> 18:27.960
down on this.

18:27.960 --> 18:29.000
Maybe that can happen.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Maybe it mostly already has.

18:30.000 --> 18:34.480
I don't know, Canonical seem to love the CLA though, don't they?

18:34.480 --> 18:38.480
Well, it just makes things easier if you want to relicense and stuff.

18:38.480 --> 18:40.120
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

18:40.120 --> 18:44.960
However, if you read Alan's blog, they talk about refocusing the project for quote unquote

18:44.960 --> 18:49.560
Ubuntu core and separating the Android stuff out as its own project.

18:49.560 --> 18:53.840
That might be lining it up for something like pulling out the CLA, putting it up on GitHub.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.440
I'm not convinced, really.

18:55.440 --> 18:56.440
I hope so.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.200
I hope it happens, but I just don't think it will.

18:58.200 --> 18:59.720
Yes, I am being optimistic.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.000
I'm hopeful that we can pull this off.

19:02.000 --> 19:07.020
Or we have a bunch of magic coders that show up all of a sudden and can write perfect compositors

19:07.020 --> 19:09.040
for all these open source desktops.

19:09.040 --> 19:13.020
Yeah, I think we should have seen this coming though, because more or less straight away

19:13.020 --> 19:16.680
after they made the announcement, they said that they were going to continue MIR for the

19:16.680 --> 19:22.520
IoT stuff, and where the IoT needs a display, then it just makes sense that you're going

19:22.520 --> 19:23.520
to have MIR and Wayland.

19:23.520 --> 19:28.120
Yeah, so I think the takeaway from this story, if you hear this floating around on the internet,

19:28.120 --> 19:29.720
this isn't a Wayland competitor.

19:29.720 --> 19:32.560
This is about making MIR work with Wayland.

19:32.560 --> 19:37.360
Yeah, it's about them actually using a standard for once rather than completely writing their

19:37.360 --> 19:38.360
own.

19:38.360 --> 19:39.360
Yeah.

19:39.360 --> 19:43.200
Speaking of going at their own, Intel has a bit of a bug in their Skylake and Kabylake

19:43.200 --> 19:45.360
six and seventh gen CPUs.

19:45.360 --> 19:49.160
Yeah, one of which I've got in this laptop that I'm using to speak to you now.

19:49.160 --> 19:52.200
Yeah, I think I've got one in one of my machines too.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.240
Watch out, Joe, it could dangerously misbehave.

19:54.240 --> 20:00.800
Well, it hasn't yet, and I only installed the microcode fix today, and I've not had

20:00.800 --> 20:01.800
any problems.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.880
I think that this has been a little bit overblown.

20:04.880 --> 20:10.520
This actually came out around the time we recorded this time last week, but we didn't

20:10.520 --> 20:13.480
cover it because the details were a bit sketchy at that point.

20:13.480 --> 20:20.200
But now after a week to digest it, I think that it's been a little bit overblown really,

20:20.200 --> 20:25.160
because I think it's a very specific set of circumstances that are going to trigger this

20:25.160 --> 20:26.160
bug.

20:26.160 --> 20:30.680
Yeah, not only is it certain circumstances, but they have to be under complex microarchitectural

20:30.680 --> 20:36.480
conditions as Intel puts it, where this bug can only happen if both the logical processor

20:36.480 --> 20:39.840
on the same physical processors are active.

20:39.840 --> 20:43.640
Whatever that means, it's their way of trying to say, it's really hard to pull this off.

20:43.640 --> 20:47.500
And I buy it, because honestly, some of these products have been in the market for a couple

20:47.500 --> 20:50.360
of years now, and we're just now coming across this.

20:50.360 --> 20:53.320
There's an interesting conundrum here, though, because a lot of Linux advocates, a lot of

20:53.320 --> 20:56.840
open source advocates out there are now all of a sudden in a position where they kind

20:56.840 --> 20:59.000
of need that nasty microcode.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.680
That's what I find fascinating about this story.

21:00.680 --> 21:05.840
Yeah, and if you're running a pragmatic distro like Ubuntu, for example, it's very easy to

21:05.840 --> 21:11.360
get this microcode and run it at boot, and then you don't have to go into your BIOS or

21:11.360 --> 21:17.080
EFI and disable hyper-threading, which, well, that's the question for you.

21:17.080 --> 21:20.520
Did you disable hyper-threading when you heard about this, or did you just risk it?

21:20.520 --> 21:21.520
No.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.520
Yeah, I'm going to risk it, Joe.

21:22.520 --> 21:23.520
I'm just going to go for it.

21:23.520 --> 21:27.760
And then what I think I'll do is in a few weeks, I'll check in on my motherboard's website

21:27.760 --> 21:32.000
and vendor's website and see if they have a BIOS update for my system, and I'll probably

21:32.000 --> 21:33.480
fix it that way.

21:33.480 --> 21:34.480
Yeah.

21:34.480 --> 21:39.240
And I'm not hugely happy about running proprietary code, but I thought I'd better do it anyway

21:39.240 --> 21:40.600
just to be safe.

21:40.600 --> 21:45.960
But the problem with Debian, and that's why it came out of Debian that we realized this

21:45.960 --> 21:51.840
was a problem, is that Debian is not, they're not very happy about shipping proprietary

21:51.840 --> 21:52.840
code, are they?

21:52.840 --> 21:54.480
And they're not happy about facilitating it.

21:54.480 --> 21:58.080
The microcode is not installed by default on a Debian installation either.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.640
It's in the repo, but it's not by default.

21:59.640 --> 22:03.660
Yeah, and it's not only Linux users who are affected by this.

22:03.660 --> 22:08.920
It's a hardware problem, so it's not exclusive to the Linux community.

22:08.920 --> 22:13.720
You could be forgiven for seeing it that way because it's associated with Debian.

22:13.720 --> 22:16.680
People first thought it was just a Debian problem, then, oh, it's a Linux problem.

22:16.680 --> 22:17.880
Well, no, hang on.

22:17.880 --> 22:22.440
This has been a problem for Windows and Mac OS as well, and presumably BSD even.

22:22.440 --> 22:26.420
I got a little spooked when I started reading deeper and deeper into this story and started

22:26.420 --> 22:30.960
hearing from people that used to work at Intel, and they said, you have no idea.

22:30.960 --> 22:35.800
There are so many bugs in these CPUs now because they're so complex.

22:35.800 --> 22:40.280
What you hear about is just the tip of the iceberg, and I'm like, okay, that's going

22:40.280 --> 22:41.280
to make me neurotic.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.800
If I go any further, I'm going to stop right there.

22:43.800 --> 22:47.320
Yeah, not to mention the potential back doors and stuff.

22:47.320 --> 22:53.000
Yeah, it's not a pretty picture, but it's what we have for today at least.

22:53.000 --> 22:56.960
You know, I probably will update just because I run my recording systems with these processors,

22:56.960 --> 22:59.640
and I want to do everything I can to make them as stable as possible.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.880
And thankfully, microcode package updates are available for Linux.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.240
If you're on Windows 10, you're going to be waiting a little bit.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.240
Yeah, hang on.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.960
So you want it to be as stable as possible, and you're still using GNOME?

23:08.960 --> 23:11.480
Your face, Joe, your face.

23:11.480 --> 23:16.480
I did some updates, and so far, at least it isn't crashing three times a day anymore.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.520
I am still going to move off.

23:18.520 --> 23:25.800
I've actually decided, I think after my conversation with Dustin, I think I'm going to do Ubuntu

23:25.800 --> 23:31.000
16.04 LTS with Livepatch on the broadcast machine.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.520
Now it's just waiting for me to get off my butt and reload that system.

23:33.520 --> 23:38.260
But it's such a tight Jack Bauer window I have to work in, because there's only so much

23:38.260 --> 23:39.960
time before we're live again.

23:39.960 --> 23:44.760
So you've got to reload the system and not miss any of your broadcast config.

23:44.760 --> 23:49.360
Is 16.04 going to be new enough for you to get the software you need though, the versions?

23:49.360 --> 23:52.920
I hadn't really checked yet, so it's something I've got to look into.

23:52.920 --> 23:58.040
Before I even do it, I would set up a whole other rig and try it all there, and validate

23:58.040 --> 23:59.760
the config before I actually put it in production.

23:59.760 --> 24:00.760
So I don't know.

24:00.760 --> 24:01.760
I'm hopeful.

24:01.760 --> 24:03.840
I hear there's these wonderful things called PPAs.

24:03.840 --> 24:07.440
So I was going to say, you love a PPA, not.

24:07.440 --> 24:10.440
Maybe I can get a flat pack.

24:10.440 --> 24:11.440
Maybe even a snap.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.440
Yeah.

24:12.440 --> 24:13.440
You never know.

24:13.440 --> 24:14.440
I'd take it actually.

24:14.440 --> 24:15.440
Could be a good way to distribute OBS.

24:15.440 --> 24:16.440
Are you listening, OBS Project?

24:16.440 --> 24:17.440
Make it happen.

24:17.440 --> 24:18.440
All right.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.000
Well, that brings us to the end of this week's episode.
