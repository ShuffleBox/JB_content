00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,080
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,080
This is episode 76 recorded on October 21st, 2018.

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,080
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,280
It's good to be connected with you from the heart of the old school Silicon Valley at

7
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:33,040
the Intel campus in Santa Clara, California, live from MeetBSD.

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,760
We have a heck of a news lineup this week.

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,760
Some big releases.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,360
Yeah, well, let's start with Ubuntu 18.10, but is it really a big release or is it a

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,040
kind of minor point release for them because it's not an LTS?

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,840
I think it depends on the kind of user that you are.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,100
In a weird way, even though this isn't an LTS release, there's some nice improvements

14
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,720
in here for the server version.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,600
18.10 ships with OpenStack Rocky, which we just recently covered on TechSnap, and it

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,080
includes the latest version of Kubernetes, version 1.12, which brings some increased

17
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:07,120
security and scalability by automating the provision of clusters, which is sweet and

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,120
is being pitched as a way to dynamically respond to your workload.

19
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,400
And I mention all of that because those are two really big ticket items in the server

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,920
world right now, and 18.10 ships with them by default.

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,560
So if you're looking from the server user perspective, it's a pretty solid update.

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,840
If you're looking from the desktop perspective, 18.10 introduces GNOME 3.3.0, which includes

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,960
upstream performance patches and some vendor-applied performance patches by Canonical Directly,

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,480
which make it really fly.

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,520
It's the fastest GNOME desktop I've ever used.

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,960
And it's got that new Yaru community contribute theme, which looks really sharp on high DPI

27
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,960
displays.

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,960
I was looking at that theme side by side with the old one earlier today, and I couldn't

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,560
really decide whether I liked it more, really.

30
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,380
In some sense, it's kind of more modern and a bit flatter.

31
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,280
But then it's a bit garish, I find, the kind of bright orange and stuff.

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,320
It was always orange before, but I'm not really sold on it, to be honest.

33
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,640
I think that's a fair criticism.

34
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,520
It is a bit in your face, and I could totally see why someone like yourself wouldn't be

35
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,640
a huge fan of it.

36
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,100
But in the modern era of 4K screens and whatnot, you kind of have to redo some of these themes

37
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,000
anyways to make them look good.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,640
I think it looks pretty sharp, but I was looking on a really high-end Dell display, which was

39
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,880
designed to really pop.

40
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,320
And so the combination of the two together really made an impression on me.

41
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,760
It almost is distracting, though, in some ways, in its brightness.

42
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,440
Yeah, that's kind of how I felt about it, really.

43
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,480
But it's funny, if you look at this announcement post from Canonical, it's very much kind of

44
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,880
spreading the love across the various releases that 1810 makes up.

45
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:52,720
From the cloud and server stuff and the desktop, they talk about improved gaming performance.

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,400
They're very much trying to hedge their bets, aren't they, and not concentrate too much

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,200
on one aspect of it.

48
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,800
See, now, that I kind of disagree with.

49
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,960
I think this is them more focused than ever.

50
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,360
It's three succinct categories, cloud, desktop, and snaps.

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
That's really it.

52
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:15,560
Instead of a mobile and a TV and a netbook edition, it really is, this is the Canonical

53
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,920
portfolio of solutions now, cloud, desktop, and snaps.

54
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,140
I suppose that is true, but it feels like there was more emphasis on the desktop early

55
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,960
on with Ubuntu.

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,040
And then it kind of swung the other way to be, you know, the desktop seemed to be in

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,000
maintenance mode for quite a long time.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,280
And now it's kind of swung back into the middle.

59
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Ah, yeah.

60
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,600
It's getting more attention than it did for a while, you mean?

61
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,080
Yeah, yeah.

62
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,160
And yeah, I suppose you're right, ultimately, though, that they've kind of slimmed it down

63
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,440
to these three categories, which kind of look nice to investors, don't they?

64
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,200
Yeah, I think investors definitely have something to do with this.

65
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,160
I think that's what the whole restructure has been about since they announced it, what

66
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,240
is it, more than a year ago now.

67
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:03,260
When they dropped Unity 8 and restructured the company, in particular, one of their goals

68
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,040
was to make desktop development more sustainable.

69
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,800
Switching to Gnome Shell meant they were no longer creating their own desktop environment.

70
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,640
They didn't have to have all of those developers and engineers and artists on staff to produce

71
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,500
that and maintain it, update it, and add new features.

72
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,240
They could work with upstream code.

73
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,120
And now we're seeing the third release since that restructure.

74
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,940
And their Gnome implementation is pretty good.

75
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,360
And they've got some of their own performance patches that they found.

76
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,040
They've submitted those upstream as well.

77
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,680
So Gnome Shell overall is getting better.

78
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,160
And that helps all the distributions using Gnome Shell.

79
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,960
And for myself, if I were a Gnome user, I would be making this update.

80
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,240
I would be upgrading to 18.10.

81
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,960
I would have already done it.

82
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,280
I'm personally sticking on 18.04.

83
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,760
But if I was a Gnome Shell user or a big Linux gamer, I would be making this update.

84
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,440
Because not only do you get kernel 4.18, but there's updates to Mesa and Xorg to significantly

85
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,680
improve game performance.

86
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,200
So you combine that with the improved Gnome 3.30 performance, and that's a great desktop

87
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,560
for Gnome Shell enthusiasts or Linux gamers.

88
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,720
Well, I'm sitting here looking at Xubuntu 16.04.

89
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,880
So I don't think there's much chance of me upgrading, I'm afraid.

90
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
Wow, man.

91
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
You know what?

92
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,320
In a way, you should just ride that thing out to the end.

93
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,420
I mean, that is the way to go at this point.

94
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,420
You're so locked in.

95
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,960
You might as well just take it all the way up to the red line.

96
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,800
Well, that's what I did with 14.04.

97
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,400
So I probably will do.

98
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,620
But speaking of the flavors then, with Xubuntu, not much there of interest.

99
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,000
And with the other flavors as well, nothing of great note, I don't think.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,880
Apart from Lubuntu, which has made the switch to LXQt by default now, and it feels like

101
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,960
the right time to do it.

102
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,640
Because having looked at it, I was really impressed.

103
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
It's solid.

104
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,120
I could really use it, I think.

105
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,640
Well, I kind of want to know more about that.

106
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:52,360
What is it specifically about LXQt or that desktop that's pushing those XFCE feels for

107
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
you?

108
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,160
Well, for a start off, you've got one panel at the bottom.

109
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,840
I know XFCE doesn't have that by default, certainly, as Ubuntu, but it's easy enough

110
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,020
to move the panel to the bottom.

111
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,640
That's what I do with a start menu that's searchable, but simple.

112
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,840
And it's modern at the same time.

113
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,880
And that's what I like about it.

114
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,600
It's light, but it's modern.

115
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,940
It's not stuck on GTK2 and making the slow transition.

116
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,280
It's based on Qt 5.

117
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,620
It's modern technologies.

118
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,280
It can work on a really low end system, had it run on a Core 2 Duo, and it was fine.

119
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,440
But then it'll absolutely fly on an i5 or i7.

120
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,960
So it's kind of almost leapfrogged Marte as far as I'm concerned.

121
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,160
I know WinPress won't like to hear that, but it feels just right.

122
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,680
I mean, I've been following the progress of it and there's been little bugs here and there.

123
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,280
And I haven't tested it extensively.

124
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:50,120
So I'm sure that there's probably little annoyances here and there, but it seems to be the right

125
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
time.

126
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,200
I think it was a good decision to do this now, one release after the LTS for Ubuntu.

127
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,240
So we've got plenty of time now before 2004 when I think it's going to be absolutely rock

128
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
solid.

129
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,520
And the bottom line is, Lubuntu is the flavor to watch.

130
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,920
Well speaking of that handsome Martin Wimpress, I was chatting with him on Linux Unplugged

131
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:13,940
last week and he mentioned one of the really nice things about the 1810 development cycle

132
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,520
is the work that went into getting a lot of the hardware working, the new drivers and

133
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,560
whatnot.

134
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,960
That does make its way back to 1804, the LTS release, as a hardware enablement stack.

135
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,240
And that will likely ship as 18.04.2.

136
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,880
And so those of us that are sticking with the LTS, actually, if we just wait a little

137
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,360
bit, do eventually get some of these hardware goodies.

138
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,440
I think that's a really cool cycle.

139
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,800
And just something I wanted to point out that maybe non-Ubuntu users weren't aware of is

140
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,240
that's kind of a nice perk of the LTS cycle on the Ubuntu side.

141
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,980
Yeah, I'm in the planning stages of building a desktop at the moment.

142
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:56,740
And if I do go for the 9th gen i5 or i7, I think I'm going to have to go newer than 1804.

143
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:03,840
So it'll probably force me into this at least until the 0.2 release comes out for 1804.

144
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,040
So yeah, I may well end up using this sooner than I think.

145
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,200
And last but not least on the 1810 flavor side, if you happen to be lucky to find yourself

146
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:19,360
getting one of those GPD Pocket 2 devices, there has been specific work in Ubuntu Mate

147
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,720
to make those devices sing with Linux.

148
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,080
So go check that out, because now those devices ship with Windows by default, and you got

149
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
to take care of that.

150
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,060
Man, it really makes me want one, even though there's nothing I would do with it apart from

151
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,060
just play with it.

152
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,060
I know.

153
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,060
I really want one.

154
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,000
I actually was talking to Wimpy about it, and it sounds like it may be possible to turn

155
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,840
that thing into a mobile podcast studio.

156
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Oh yeah, it's powerful.

157
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
Yeah.

158
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,520
I just kind of don't have that desire and never leave the house.

159
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,760
I know.

160
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,800
It sounds like punishment, really, because then you have to go out and see people, and

161
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,000
you have to go out and be in the environment and get a sunburn.

162
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's just no good.

163
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yeah, exactly.

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,540
Well, before we move off Ubuntu, we should quickly mention the statistics site that they've

165
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,980
put up now.

166
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,440
We got some of these statistics a couple of months ago, and there was a promise to have

167
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:13,540
more detail before the 18.10 cycle was over, and right at the last minute, I think it was

168
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:18,160
Will Cook who posted this, so we've got some more detail.

169
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,760
I mean, I don't think there's anything hugely surprising from these stats, and the one thing

170
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,200
that everyone wanted, absolute numbers of users, well, we're not getting that by the

171
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
looks of things.

172
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,560
I'll tell you what else I was hoping we'd see that isn't in there is a breakdown of

173
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,760
which versions of Ubuntu are still the most active, 14.04, 16.04, et cetera, et cetera.

174
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,400
There is a couple of interesting things in here, though.

175
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,520
Turns out 80% of people do clean installs, which I think is interesting, versus an upgrade,

176
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:57,820
and 99% of people surveyed, which was 66% of the installs, use X11, so the Wayland future

177
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,800
is still far, far away.

178
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,760
Well, that's because it's not by default.

179
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,560
You have to kind of enable that afterwards, don't you, so that's, I don't know where that

180
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,920
1% came from, really.

181
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,560
From those of us trying it, I think, which is actually pretty surprising.

182
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,760
Now there's also all other kinds of information here, like most popular screen sizes, the

183
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,840
types of disk layouts and partition types, so we would recommend just go read through

184
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,240
it, because they've got some great visuals, too, and you can find a link at linuxactionnews.com

185
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
slash 76.

186
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,440
Yeah, and it's also worth mentioning that these are updated dynamically as more and

187
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,800
more people install, so they're not necessarily going to be the same stats today as they are

188
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,320
in a couple of weeks.

189
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,600
But another huge release this week is elementary OS 5.0 Juno.

190
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,800
This is a big release for a few reasons, probably the number one reason being that they take

191
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,660
their time between releases, and elementary OS has a release model that's not based on

192
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,740
date, but it's based on open bugs, and after they burn through the open bugs, then they

193
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:58,720
generate another release, which tends to trigger more bugs, then they burn through those, they

194
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,160
release a release candidate, which then triggers more bugs, they burn down all of those bugs,

195
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,640
and then they have a release.

196
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,840
What that means for end user is you generally have a pretty polished product by the time

197
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,480
the version ships.

198
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,640
You don't really have to wait around for the updates, and there's a lot in this new release.

199
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,380
They've jumped to version 5 with that, and it's to represent how far they've come as

200
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,100
a development platform, but also as a distribution.

201
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,920
They have one of the larger chunks of market shares when you step outside Ubuntu proper,

202
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,320
and they've become a well-respected distribution over the last couple of years, and sort of

203
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,420
shaken free that Mac clone stigma for the most part, and people recognize it now as

204
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:43,800
just a well-engineered, refined user experience, and it really comes together in Juno.

205
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,160
But how can we possibly talk about all the features here?

206
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,240
There's a post on Medium from Cassidy, and it is, well, on Medium it says a 31 minute

207
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
read.

208
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,520
It's 7,000 words, I think, and it took me a fair while to get through it all, and there's

209
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:04,720
just so much refinements, so many new features, I just don't know which one to even start

210
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,720
with.

211
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,880
It really is worth a look, this post.

212
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,000
Even if you're never going to run elementary OS in a thousand years, it's worth a look.

213
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,200
I don't think any other distro does it this well, and it's a massive summary with lots

214
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,960
of really well-done pictures, and the thing I take away from it is this app center is

215
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,320
a big deal.

216
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,380
There's a lot of other stuff in here, development platform stuff, UI changes, performance improvements,

217
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,680
the code app gets a lot of love, but the app center, with its pay-what-you-want model,

218
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,920
and now this new you-can-try-out-an-app, which, what a brilliant idea, try before you buy.

219
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,160
Who would have ever thought of that?

220
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,560
You can try out an app, and then if you like it, when it does future updates down the road,

221
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,800
say two, three weeks, you're still actively using the app, and you go to do an update,

222
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,680
it'll say, hey, would you like to maybe kick this guy or gal two bucks?

223
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,080
Because now could be the time to do it.

224
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,600
I mean, you could just skip that, but I like this system where you can try out the application,

225
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,640
and then later on, you can be like, hey, yeah, you know what, I will kick him 10, 15 bucks.

226
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
Here you go.

227
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,640
And then it does the update.

228
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,560
Yeah, and you can go in at any time and do that.

229
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,680
If you download it for free and get some value out of it, then you can just go...

230
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,240
It's quite subtle, actually.

231
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,920
Right at the bottom of the page on the app center for each application, you just click

232
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,440
the little button, and then you can chuck them a few bucks, which I think it's nice

233
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
that it's subtle.

234
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,160
They would have probably got some criticism if they'd made it more front and center, but

235
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,580
it's nice that that's an option now.

236
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:37,360
And it's good to see that someone on the Linux desktop is trying to make some money out of

237
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,960
it, because a lot of work goes in.

238
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,520
And what they're trying to do is have this coherent experience, which to be honest is

239
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
not for me.

240
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:49,120
I don't really like the way it all works.

241
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,640
I am the stick in the mud who's using XFCE, as I've said many, many times.

242
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,120
But they have a vision, and they want to fund that.

243
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,360
And I think that it's refreshing that they're not kind of ashamed of wanting to do that.

244
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,080
I think you can understand a lot of their actions when you look at it in the frame of

245
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,620
they're attempting to do the things that nobody else has done.

246
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,560
Because a lot of the other things that have been attempted haven't been successful on

247
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,660
a large scale.

248
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,940
And so it doesn't make a lot of sense to keep repeating the same mistakes.

249
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,840
So with elementary, they're attempting to do something a little different.

250
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,040
And I really think the Linux desktop ecosystem needs that.

251
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,960
Well, last week, we talked about Redis and how the company who makes that, Redis Labs,

252
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:34,640
had made a change to the license, which hadn't gone down very well in the community.

253
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
And this week, it's the turn of MongoDB.

254
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,600
Yeah, it appears MongoDB is a bit miffed at some cloud providers, especially in Asia,

255
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,400
are taking its open source code and then offering a hosted commercial version of the database,

256
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,300
and then not contributing back to MongoDB in any way.

257
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:55,720
As you probably know, MongoDB has traditionally been licensed under the AGPL version three.

258
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,680
And they released a statement about a change in license to the server side public license.

259
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,360
They write, MongoDB was previously licensed under the GNU AGPL version three, which meant

260
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,280
companies who wanted to run MongoDB as a publicly available service had to open source their

261
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,040
software or obtain a commercial license from MongoDB, the company goes on to explain.

262
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,560
However, MongoDB's popularity has led some organizations to test the boundaries of the

263
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,120
AGPL version three.

264
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,360
So they've gotten a little upset about this, just like Redis essentially was.

265
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,120
So they're switching to the SSPL, which stands for server side public license.

266
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,420
And it explicitly states that anybody who wants to offer a MongoDB type service or really

267
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:42,100
any other software that uses this license needs to either get a commercial license or

268
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,920
open source the service to give it back to the community.

269
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,220
That's the essence of the license that they've switched to.

270
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,760
Now once again, this is not an OSI compliant license.

271
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,840
So it is technically not going to be open source from now on.

272
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:00,320
And that includes patched old versions as well, which they're changing the license to.

273
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,600
MongoDB have said that they have reached out to the OSI and are waiting for their approval

274
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,840
of this license.

275
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:15,160
And asterisk, I'm not a liar and all that, but I can't see it happening because this

276
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:23,080
license, the server side public license mandates that you have to release all of the code that's

277
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,500
running your service.

278
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,380
And people have kind of taken that to the extreme of, well, what if your service is

279
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,740
running on AWS?

280
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,480
Does that mean that they have to open source all of AWS?

281
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,060
Well, that's not happening, obviously.

282
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,920
And so it might mean that people just can't use MongoDB anymore.

283
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,400
See I actually think it's even worse than that.

284
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,600
And there's a real problem here that the MongoDB CTO and co-founder points out in a statement

285
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,800
he released.

286
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,360
It reads, the market is increasingly consuming software as a service, creating an incredible

287
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,760
opportunity to foster a new wave of great open source server side software.

288
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,280
Unfortunately, once an open source project becomes interesting, it is too easy for a

289
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,380
cloud vendor who have not developed the software to capture all of the value but contribute

290
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,320
nothing back to the community.

291
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,080
So they're making the case that this is a huge problem that open source software is

292
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,080
going to face.

293
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,920
As they get more and more popular and they provide a server service, a provider comes

294
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:25,640
along, packages it up as a service, starts selling a monthly rate for it, maybe even

295
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,880
forks it to a degree and starts contributing their own features and requirements to it,

296
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,600
and never contributes any of the improvements back to the project upstream.

297
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,680
But to your point, the genie is already out of the bottle.

298
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,240
There's no going back.

299
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,240
If MongoDB makes a big change here, these vendors have already been disrespectful to

300
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,480
the open source spirit and license.

301
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,200
So they're not going to change their behavior.

302
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,280
They'll maintain a fork of it before any of these license changes go into effect.

303
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,680
And they'll just continue to run the old version as long as they can make a profit from it.

304
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,280
To me, it seems like there's no going back at this point.

305
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,360
Well, except that it's going to be fairly difficult to maintain that fork because any

306
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,840
security fixes for the older versions are going to be released under this same SSPL,

307
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,520
which means that, again, like we talked about last time with Redis, any fixes would have

308
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,560
to be kind of clean room.

309
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:25,520
Although, if we're talking about providers in China that don't really care about the

310
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,680
license or maybe don't understand it properly, then maybe they're just going to plow on regardless

311
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:36,360
and just merge these fixes and maintain it themselves.

312
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,080
That seems more likely to me.

313
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,800
That's what I suspect is going to happen for a large portion of the offenders.

314
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:47,060
And then for the others, maybe future companies, they just won't use MongoDB.

315
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,920
And so the project sort of loses on both fronts.

316
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,000
Yeah, I mean, it's not like MongoDB is the only database out there, right?

317
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,580
There's plenty to choose from.

318
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,680
It's a really hard spot for the project.

319
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,040
And I don't know, it's something I'm going to think about more and I think deserves further

320
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,640
discussion because MongoDB and Redis are not the only projects that are going to face this

321
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,640
issue.

322
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,800
Well, I've discussed this with Chris Lamb from Debian.

323
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:15,480
And he said that he has no intention of forking MongoDB like he has with Redis.

324
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,780
And he said it remains to be seen whether this license turns out to violate the Debian

325
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:25,780
free software guidelines, and that if it does, then it's not going to be able to be in Debian

326
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,360
and the downstream distros as well.

327
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,720
So that's going to affect Ubuntu.

328
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,840
And from his tone, I think that he strongly suspects that he didn't say it outright, but

329
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,960
I think he suspects that it's not going to conform to the Debian free software guidelines.

330
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:46,560
So it's potentially going to be a very bad thing for MongoDB in that it may just fade

331
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,560
into obscurity.

332
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:51,120
If it's not available in distros, then who's going to use it?

333
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,880
It's all those Docker users, Joe, of course.

334
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,760
Well Google finds itself in a bit of hot water.

335
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,040
And the way they're going to get out of it apparently is by making money.

336
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Well that's a sign of a good business, isn't it?

337
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,240
If you're in trouble, find a way to make some money to fix it.

338
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:15,320
Yeah, so this goes back to July when the European Commission fined Google $5 billion for breaking

339
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,960
EU antitrust laws with regards Android and how they've been treating the OEMs.

340
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,400
And although Google said they would appeal it and are in the process of appealing it,

341
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,320
they've also decided to do something about it just in case, kind of hedge their bets.

342
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:36,080
And so now they've pretty much complied, by the looks of things, just about.

343
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,160
We'll get back to that making money thing again.

344
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,400
I don't know if the EU is going to kind of stand for that, but I think ultimately it's

345
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,880
kind of worked, hasn't it?

346
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,120
Yeah, this might do the trick.

347
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,360
And there's so many echoes of Microsoft and Internet Explorer here, it is giving me some

348
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,360
nostalgia.

349
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,520
See, everyone listening to this show knows how this works.

350
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,640
If you want an officially blessed version of Android from Google with all of the goodies,

351
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:05,440
you have to ship certain applications as part of the OEM agreement with Google.

352
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,160
And that right there is the rub.

353
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:12,360
Forcing the bundling of certain applications like the Chrome browser and the Google search

354
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,640
app is exactly the kind of behavior that got Microsoft in trouble back in the day and just

355
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,760
got Google in trouble now.

356
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:25,960
So this means that devices in the region, in the European Economic Area, can be sold

357
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,880
with Gmail, Google Maps, and YouTube, Google Play, and so on, but no Google search app

358
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,880
in Chrome.

359
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,300
Instead, manufacturers can just include their own search engines and web browsers, or they

360
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:41,680
can license those for around 40-ish US greenbacks from Google.

361
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:46,600
Yeah, and up until now, any manufacturer who wanted to ship Android with all the Google

362
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:53,280
stuff weren't allowed by that license agreement to ship other devices with forks of Android.

363
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,000
And that was a huge sticking point, whereas now they're going to be able to.

364
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,680
But where I think this may fall down for Google, and again, I'm not a lawyer, is if you are

365
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:09,520
a manufacturer and you are willing to play the game and ship all of the stuff that Google

366
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,160
wants and have it all placed exactly where you want, then it looks like you'll be able

367
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,680
to get away with that for free.

368
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,580
Whereas if you make any changes, that's when you're going to have to start paying on a

369
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,760
per-device basis, and that is governed by the pixel density, which is quite a clever

370
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:30,440
way for Google to tie the amount to the value of the device, because pixel density generally

371
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,020
scales with the retail price.

372
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:39,040
So it's pretty clever of them, but I just can't help but feel that that may not go down

373
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,080
well with the European Commission.

374
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,560
Well they sent a letter to the European Commission trying to justify all of this, and in there

375
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,520
there's a very interesting admission.

376
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,920
See they claim that the bundling of the Google Search app and Chrome is how they essentially

377
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,960
finance the development of Android.

378
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,720
Here's what they write, since the pre-installation of Google Search and Chrome together with

379
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,960
our other apps helped us fund the development and free distribution of Android, we will

380
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:11,600
introduce a new paid licensing agreement for smartphones and tablets shipped to the EEA.

381
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,160
Android will remain free and open source.

382
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,520
So the case they're making to the Commission is, look, by taking these apps out, we can't

383
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,800
fund the development of Android anymore, so we have to charge a little bit of money.

384
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,920
But the implicit statement is, all that monitoring that we get from Google Search and Chrome

385
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,120
is how we really generate revenue.

386
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,440
That's what I read as the implicit statement there.

387
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,880
Well yeah, and another key aspect to this is that if those OEMs don't play ball with

388
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:42,640
Google, they're going to miss out on their slice of that search revenue.

389
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,720
And so even if they're shipping Chrome and Search, if they're not doing things exactly

390
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,560
how Google wants, then they're just going to be cut off from what I imagine is a very

391
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,120
serious chunk of the revenue that comes from selling these devices.

392
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,720
Because as we know, they've basically lost leaders at this point.

393
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,360
Almost all of the OEMs selling Android devices don't actually make money from them.

394
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,560
It's only this money afterwards that they're getting from the search revenue that makes

395
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,160
it even worth bothering with.

396
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,760
It's good to have that big lever.

397
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,360
It's good to be the king and Google sitting there with that big lever.

398
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:23,740
And they've come up with a really clever solution to this by licensing it and essentially leaning

399
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,160
on the business dependency that these OEMs have with Google.

400
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,800
Yeah, but again, I'm not convinced that the European Commission are going to let them

401
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
get away with it.

402
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:37,160
It might be a long protracted battle again, but maybe that's what Google's plan is here.

403
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,480
Just keep moving the goalposts and just keep one step ahead of them.

404
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,200
Well, I guess we can all look forward to another riveting Google legal battle.

405
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Yeah.

406
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,200
All right.

407
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,900
Well, let's end with an update, I suppose, to this Linux code of conduct situation.

408
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,120
There was a lot of controversy when this change happened and when the code of conduct was

409
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,360
brought in from both sides.

410
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,880
Some people saying that it was far too much and some people were saying it wasn't enough.

411
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,520
But I think the main problem was that there wasn't really that much clarity at the time.

412
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:15,160
It had been kind of rushed out and kind of cobbled together without much community involvement

413
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,760
or any community involvement really.

414
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,480
But now we've got a little bit more clarity because Greg has posted an interpretation

415
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,120
document and a mediator has been appointed.

416
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,120
Yeah, it turns out Greg KH was working in private in some super secret chat room or mailing

417
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:34,160
list with kernel maintainers and developers on addressing their feedback and trying to

418
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,040
come up with solutions to essentially all of the contentious issues around the code

419
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,640
of conduct, but doing so in private so that way they could come to some consensus before

420
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,360
they took all of this out.

421
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,320
And like you just mentioned, they appointed that conflict mediator.

422
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,280
So she will be the initial contact point for mediation and she's the legal director for

423
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,560
the Software Freedom Law Center.

424
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,360
So in the place before it was the technical advisory board, she sort of steps in between

425
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,360
there.

426
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,680
And then the other thing, just a note, we don't have to read the whole thing.

427
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,080
We can link it in the show notes if you're interested, but there is a part in here I

428
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,600
like in the part of the document, the interpretation document that describes how to read the code

429
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
of conduct.

430
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,280
There's a line in here that says, in the end, be kind to each other.

431
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,420
It's really what the end goal is for everybody.

432
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:22,080
We know everyone is human and will fail at times, but the primary goal for all of us

433
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,160
should be to work toward amicable resolutions of problems.

434
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,880
Enforcements of the code of conduct will be the last resort option.

435
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,920
And I guess also worth mentioning, they also clarified where you're a representative of

436
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,800
the kernel community or not.

437
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,740
And it's much more clear.

438
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,660
And they essentially say, if you are misbehaving in some other forum, it's their rules, their

439
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,520
code of conduct that are applicable to you, not ours, with the exception of, as they put

440
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,100
it, extreme circumstances.

441
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,320
Now I've seen a bit of backlash to this.

442
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,640
I was hoping that this was going to kind of put the fire out, but it seems to have just

443
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:05,080
poured oil on it, really, in that the people who were kind of screaming about social justice

444
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,580
worries and all that, this has not appeased them.

445
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,960
This has just somehow made it worse for them.

446
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,060
But when I was reading through it myself, I just thought, well, this all looks very

447
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:23,480
standard, corporate kind of policy that normally wouldn't be out in the open, but it doesn't

448
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,800
seem that much different from a big organization, well, any organization of about the size of

449
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,160
the Linux kernel community.

450
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:36,000
You know, it's funny you say that, because I've been down here at MeetBSD, and this hasn't

451
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
come up at all.

452
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,140
And this just hasn't been on the radar.

453
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:43,660
So I read the story, I read through the mailing list post by Greg and a couple of follow ups,

454
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,020
and I read the interpretation document.

455
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:50,840
And my takeaway was, okay, well, that kind of clears up some of the concerns I had.

456
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,960
All right, I'm feeling much better.

457
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,120
This seems very reasonable.

458
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,440
And I walked away from it.

459
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,500
And I haven't been on any threads about it or any comments section because I've been

460
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,220
here at MeetBSD.

461
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:04,880
And so I'm coming into this with zero internet outrage impressions.

462
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,340
I haven't even been on Twitter.

463
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,320
So I came into it clean thinking this seems like it's a good way to address this.

464
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,840
It seems like Greg's really got a handle on the situation.

465
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,960
And it seems like it solved a lot of the up in the air questions we had.

466
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,560
I had no idea there was any outrage.

467
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,800
But of course there is.

468
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
I should have known.

469
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:27,120
Yeah, you're kind of like that dog in the This is Fine cartoon, I think, just completely

470
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,400
blissfully unaware of all the fire around you.

471
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,360
I'm just hanging out with the BSD guys.

472
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,180
And they're just pretty chill in general, really.

473
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,840
So I just thought everything was cool.

474
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,800
Yeah, well, we will have to see because this is fairly recent news.

475
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:44,240
We'll have to see over this week whether or not these initial comments and, you know,

476
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,320
discussion that I've seen pan out to be kind of the majority opinion, but I'm really hoping

477
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,320
not.

478
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,320
I think we just need to draw a line under this.

479
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:59,480
Yes, okay, is the kind of corporatization, I suppose, of Linux kernel development.

480
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,800
But this has been coming for a long time.

481
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,880
We're talking about millions of dollars here.

482
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,360
Yeah, it's been that already.

483
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,400
It's already been that.

484
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,720
We just haven't really seen it outwardly.

485
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,320
This is the formalization of what is a bureaucracy around one of the world's largest open source

486
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,400
projects.

487
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,360
And I think it proves that this is a living document that can be amended and changed as

488
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,440
it suits the project.

489
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,760
They've just demonstrated that and they did so in an organized fashion with buy off by

490
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,600
many members of the project now.

491
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,980
So it's not just a handful, it's many members of the project.

492
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,720
So I think this, if nothing, should at least appease people in the fact that it shows that

493
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,360
they can make changes, that this is a living document.

494
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,520
And that's good to see too.

495
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,240
Oh man, you do love a bit of wishful thinking, don't you?

496
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,880
I think it's the BSD guys rubbing off on me because they're wishful, they're eventually

497
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,200
going to take over the world.

498
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,360
I want to give a quick shout out to IX Systems.

499
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,040
They put together a heck of an event at Meet BSD California.

500
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:58,800
And it has been really cool to spend the week at the Intel campus inside Intel and going

501
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,240
in their auditorium and also getting to hang out in their cafeteria and walk around on

502
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,400
their campus.

503
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:10,040
The BSD people have some cool stuff in the works and they're facing some major changes

504
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
in the project.

505
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,860

506
