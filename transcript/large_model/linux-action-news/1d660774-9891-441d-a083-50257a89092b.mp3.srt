00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,880
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:20,160
This is episode 56, recorded on June 3rd, 2018.

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,160
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,160
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,560
It's good to be connected with you from Cortez, Colorado, and it's great to kick things off

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,480
with a Linux hardware story.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,600
Yeah, the Atari VCS, which I think we talked about on one of the very first episodes of

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,720
Linux Action News, that is finally on IndieGoGo, and it's doing incredibly well.

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,920
They've smashed through their target, so this thing is definitely happening.

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,040
Smashed it they have, Joe.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,800
They've raised 2,418% of their original $100,000 goal as we record this episode, and something

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,780
tells me it's going to go up from there.

14
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:58,440
You might kind of remember this story because it was teased as the Atari box in June of

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,440
2017 by Atari at E3.

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,520
Now we have a little more information, and I thought it would be interesting to go into

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:11,620
the background of it because the Atari VCS really started as the brainchild of an individual

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:17,300
who joined Atari with the intention of releasing a box like this after his observations of

19
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,120
players that were connecting laptops to televisions to play games on larger screens, and then

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,400
were using things like Skype and Twitter to do multiplayer gaming communication.

21
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,700
He thought they had good brand recognition with this group.

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,240
If they could put something in a box together that they could sell, it might actually have

23
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
some demand.

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,040
Lots of speculation online by YouTubers and others if anything like this could ever be

25
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:46,240
successful, but this funding seems to indicate there is a massive audience for this, 9,321

26
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,200
backers as of this recording.

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,840
And so why are we talking about this?

28
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,000
Because it's going to run Ubuntu or at least an operating system that is based on Ubuntu.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,200
Yes, specifically they named Ubuntu Linux.

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,240
Now the original details of this box also back in 2017 kind of indicated that Linux

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,880
was going to be under the hood.

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,400
The hardware is nice.

33
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,900
It's a x86 platform.

34
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:14,000
It's going to use an AMD CPU and an AMD graphics unit, and it's a custom AMD A10 CPU, and it

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,020
has about the performance of a mid-range 2017 gaming desktop.

36
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,760
Also in 2018 or 2019 when this thing ships, it's not going to be the most competitive

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,240
hardware spec wise, but like most consoles, that's not the only feature of the box.

38
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,520
Yeah, it's only got four gigabytes of RAM as well, which even in 2018 feels a little

39
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,520
bit low.

40
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,240
And I think next year when this actually ships, that's going to be even lower, isn't it?

41
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:45,360
It's going to seem like very old specs, but if you are using this thing to play old emulated

42
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,800
games, then that's going to be plenty.

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,440
But if you kind of look into play more modern games and it is going to support Steam, then

44
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,080
you're going to be pretty limited in terms of what you can play with it.

45
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,520
Yeah, it's not really clear on that part.

46
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,800
So there's a couple of things in here that piqued up my interest.

47
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,140
They said that you're going to have access to the quote Linux sandbox, and you can add

48
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,880
more storage via cloud or USB, and you'll be able to run multiple operating systems

49
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,360
quote at once, load homebrew games, and customize your own unique platform.

50
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,920
It's ambiguous, but the language seems to indicate that this thing is going to be somewhat

51
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,160
hackable by the community, even if it is within certain confines like a VM.

52
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,680
They also indicate that there's going to be some large partner that will quote thrill

53
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,320
gamers that they can't announce yet, but it's in the works.

54
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,800
And by the time this box ships, they'll apparently have a partnership with an additional game

55
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
library.

56
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,160
I would love for that to be somebody like GOG who has a bunch of great old games, could

57
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,520
go perfect on an Atari system like this.

58
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,920
But it's funny that they point out several times that this thing is running Linux, and

59
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,120
they use the word Linux and open source, and then they proudly say that their UI is a proprietary

60
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,040
Atari UI on top of it.

61
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,680
It's a very strange structure position there.

62
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,400
Yeah, it's because they're proud of their branding and the artwork and the retro look

63
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,340
and feel they think they've come up with.

64
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,560
They think they've nailed that.

65
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,120
Yeah, it does look really cool, especially the wooden one, which is slightly more expensive.

66
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,520
But even the black one that's a couple of hundred dollars if you buy it or if you back

67
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,440
it soon, that looks pretty cool as well.

68
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,960
But looking down the details of this, there are a couple of red flags, I'm afraid.

69
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,680
One of them was that they talk about Linux Ubuntu, which is like, okay, fair enough.

70
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,120
And they don't mention what version of Ubuntu.

71
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,520
But then if you dig down a bit further, it says that it's going to be based on the 4.10

72
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:47,160
kernel, which I hope that that is a communication mistake because the 4.10 kernel is going out

73
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
of support.

74
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,600
Well, it has gone out of support.

75
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,240
And the only Ubuntu version that shipped with 4.10 was 17.04, which as we know, is out of

76
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,680
support as well.

77
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,400
So surely that was just a mistake and maybe a prototype and they're going to be basing

78
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,480
this thing on Ubuntu 18.04, please.

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Maybe.

80
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,120
Ubuntu Core, the distribution itself, is based on 16.04 right now.

81
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,800
So that would be a pretty good step.

82
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,200
It would be, I guess, a downgrade if they're on 17.10 in some senses.

83
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,360
But I would be willing to bet that's not going to change.

84
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,060
That seems to be the way these things go.

85
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,800
And that's a version two problem to solve.

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,200
Well, so you seriously think they're going to ship this thing with an out of date kernel

87
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:33,000
and an out of date OS that isn't supported and take on the burden of all of the support

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,280
rather than basing it on an Ubuntu LTS and just having all that taken care of for them

89
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,280
and then they only have to worry about their bits.

90
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,040
Yeah, that's a really good point.

91
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
I don't know.

92
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,960
I think that would be a mistake if they didn't take care of that before they shipped this

93
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
thing.

94
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,880
And keep in mind, too, we're talking this time in 2019.

95
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,300
So this thing is going to be even older by that point.

96
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,060
And I think it's even more critical when you consider that.

97
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,760
So I think you raise a really good point.

98
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,120
Were there other red flags that you saw?

99
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,480
Because I think that was the singular one that caught my attention.

100
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,000
So I'm curious if you saw others.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,740
The other red flag was they talked about secure boot.

102
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,880
Now if that is using a standard EFI where you can turn secure boot off and then boot

103
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,640
whatever you want on it, then that's all well and good.

104
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,200
But otherwise, you mentioned VMs.

105
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,320
That might be the only way you can run an alternative operating system on this.

106
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,920
And the fact that it may well be running an outdated version of Ubuntu and an old kernel

107
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,680
means that people are quite likely to want to be able to hack this thing.

108
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,760
And if it's not completely hackable, then that's just going to suck, I think.

109
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,120
I think this is going to be the device that has the most potential, if you look at this

110
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,200
category of hardware boxes.

111
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,600
The Nvidia Shield, I think, could also be in this category.

112
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,680
Atari is hinting that this thing's going to be a video streaming platform machine as well.

113
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,760
And that's where it has some serious potential, in my estimation.

114
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:02,120
If you could throw Kodi and Plex and MB and a couple of choice streaming apps onto this

115
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,840
thing, then all of a sudden you've got yourself a real winner.

116
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,480
And realistically, you could solve most of those just by allowing the Kodi app.

117
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,720
And I suspect, having looked into the background of the individual who's really driving this

118
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,320
project at Atari, I think they're clever enough to recognize that.

119
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,600
They sort of looked at the Ouya.

120
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't know if you remember that tiny little arm cube, the Ouya, that was going to be the

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,480
big gaming platform based on Android.

122
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:31,320
The individual behind the Atari box, and now the VCS, is trying to really grok a lot of

123
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,340
lessons from their failure.

124
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,780
And he identifies a few of them in different talks, and I think he's dead on.

125
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,640
So I think their fundamentals are good here.

126
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,940
I think they're going to allow some customization.

127
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:48,000
We just don't have the answers because I think, like you may have just sussed out, the person

128
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,680
that wrote this up doesn't really have any idea about what they're writing.

129
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,800
The few other things that I thought were interesting, USB-C for charging the peripherals has a really

130
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,360
interesting design that I think is worth going to look at the Indiegogo page and check it

131
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,040
out for yourself, the way they've put this thing together.

132
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:11,860
And it's potentially, if you're down with some retro gaming and you want a media box

133
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,300
to do some streaming, maybe just going to be good on its own as it is now.

134
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,840
So with that in mind, I backed it.

135
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,080
I don't normally do this anymore.

136
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,920
In fact, I kind of have taken a break for about two years from backing anything on fundraisers,

137
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,900
but I got a pretty good feeling that Atari is going to pull this thing off.

138
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,640
And they say in their fact, this really is a pre-order in a sense because they have units.

139
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,340
They're now just trying to get a feel for the market's interest.

140
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,880
If that's true or not, who knows?

141
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,960
But I have a pretty good sense they're going to actually deliver.

142
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,120
So I backed the collector's edition, the one that comes with the limited wood inserts on

143
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,400
the front and back, which reminds me of the original Atari.

144
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
So I had to go for that.

145
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,880
I just got the one with the joystick because I figured I'm going to give this thing a go.

146
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
It's a Linux box.

147
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,560
I could potentially replace an Android Nvidia Shield TV with this in my home.

148
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,760
And I'd be a lot happier running something that's based on Ubuntu than I am Android TV.

149
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,320
And then I can share my experiences with the audience.

150
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
We'll see what happens.

151
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Yeah.

152
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,820
Well, I look forward to hearing your review of it in a year's time.

153
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,880
So things are not looking too good for Endless.

154
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:23,600
At least three of their employees have been let go, I assume made redundant, including

155
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,100
Michael Hall, who used to be the community manager over at Ubuntu working for Canonical.

156
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,780
And then he moved over to Endless.

157
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,520
And he's been doing great work over there.

158
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,960
I mean, you just were talking about a post that he made recently on Linux Unplugged,

159
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
weren't you?

160
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,960
And now suddenly he's announcing on Twitter that he's looking for another job.

161
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,960
And if you dig into it a little bit deeper, you see that he is not alone.

162
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,240
There are a fair few other people.

163
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,500
And it looks like Endless are in trouble, I think, which is a bit of a shame.

164
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,620
This really caught me by surprise because on May 15th, Michael Hall had just posted

165
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:05,560
the news about Endless 3.40, the big new update to Endless, which brought in a whole bunch

166
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:10,960
of new stuff, including a newer version of GNOME, new applications, a new effort to build

167
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,040
Android apps that tie in back to the Endless desktop.

168
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,020
It really seemed like things were moving in the right direction.

169
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:22,600
So just a few days later, to see him announce his availability for hire, as he put it, I

170
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
was surprised.

171
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,640
This isn't totally uncommon in the startup world.

172
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
These things happen.

173
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,640
They change direction.

174
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,880
They pivot, as they say.

175
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,200
But it is a little concerning when the community manager is laid off.

176
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,480
That's kind of sending a message about some of their future intentions.

177
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,440
Yeah, well, it looks like they just haven't been able to continue to get the investment

178
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
that they needed.

179
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,320
They've had a fair bit of VC funding over the last few years, and it looks like that's

180
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
dried up.

181
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,260
And to be perfectly honest, I'm not hugely surprised about that because their whole business

182
00:10:53,260 --> 00:11:01,860
model was based on an operating system that was aimed at the developing world for laptops

183
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,860
or desktops.

184
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:09,840
And the only products they've ever sold are kind of NUC-type devices that need extra peripherals.

185
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:16,640
And they're trying to sell that to a market that skipped the whole desktop x86 computing

186
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,260
generation and went straight for mobile.

187
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:25,720
So how can they possibly hope to get a foot in that market when that market doesn't even

188
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,960
really exist there?

189
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,840
They've well moved on from that.

190
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,640
They never even had it in the first place.

191
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,320
It just seems like maybe the VCs have finally woken up to the fact that it's just not a

192
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,400
very good idea.

193
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,080
I think maybe you've honed in on the issue.

194
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,800
You know, Michael Hulse had something interesting to me when I had him on Linux Unplugged to

195
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,640
talk about Endless.

196
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:51,960
And that was that the company had recently discovered that their offline bunch of information

197
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,480
that you can get to without having to go on the internet, like say, all of Wikipedia and

198
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,480
lots of things like that, was really useful in prisons, that prisons were interested in

199
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,840
their hardware-software combo because they could give inmates access to information,

200
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,840
but they wouldn't necessarily give them access to things that would, quote unquote, trigger

201
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,760
them or influence them.

202
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,080
And when he said that to me, it hit me like a wave.

203
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,580
Like that must be, in the United States, a huge market.

204
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:26,040
A company could get very rich super-serving that niche because it's a big industry here

205
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,040
in the States.

206
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,440
And so you have to wonder if perhaps maybe as Endless is becoming more and more aware

207
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,800
to this, that the traditional community outreach and those aspects of the business are becoming

208
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,820
de-emphasized and the business contacts and getting into those types of setups where there

209
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,080
is considerable funding are perhaps being emphasized.

210
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,640
That's total speculation on my part, but it does kind of jive with your total speculation,

211
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
so I like it.

212
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
Yeah.

213
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Well, that's the thing.

214
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,000
Well, we've got a speculation because we haven't heard anything official from Endless at this

215
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
stage.

216
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,880
They've not made a statement about it.

217
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,040
And so what else is there to do but speculate?

218
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,200
And this is a real shame because if you look at the technicalities of the project, it's

219
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,360
actually really interesting, isn't it?

220
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,880
Using an OS tree and a modified gnome and everything, it is a very interesting project,

221
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,720
but I just don't think that it has its audience apart from this prisons thing, which I'd forgotten

222
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
about.

223
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,160
Yeah, maybe they can make that happen because there is quite a lot of money to be made there.

224
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,840
So hopefully that's what they're doing, pivoting away from the developing world to US prisons

225
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,280
and the rest of us can benefit as a result.

226
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,920
You know, I don't make any promises because I'm on the road and connectivity and time

227
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,980
are very limited, but I'm going to try to contact Endless and get a comment on the recent

228
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,600
layoffs and our speculation in the show and see if they want to put anything on the record

229
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,440
and we'll do an update if they do.

230
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,040
But I'm betting for now it's going to be mum's the word.

231
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Yeah.

232
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,520
Well, speaking of gnome, something that caught my eye this week was a story on Pharaonyx

233
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,000
about something that came out of the Gnome 2018 Performance Hackfest.

234
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,200
And that was a comment from Eric Anholt, who essentially said that Gnome 3 is just too

235
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,120
heavy to run on a Raspberry Pi, despite the various improvements they've made with regards

236
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,480
to the graphics stack and all the rest of that, it's just too fat.

237
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Right.

238
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,340
And Eric is Broadcom's maintainer of the VC4 and V3D graphics driver stacks.

239
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,880
So it's with some authority that he makes this comment.

240
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,000
And when you read the quote, which will have a link in the show notes, linuxactionnews.com

241
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,400
slash 56, it is not even partisan.

242
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,320
It's just sort of this is the facts.

243
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,400
He says, ultimately, I'm skeptical of Gnome 3 ever being usable on a Raspberry Pi.

244
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,320
The clutter-based gnome shell painting is too slow.

245
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,720
60% of a CPU is burned in the shell just trying to present a single 60 frames per second GLX

246
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
gear.

247
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,600
And there doesn't seem to be a plan for improving it other than maybe delete clutter someday.

248
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,220
Also, the JavaScript extension system being in the compositor thread means that you drop

249
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,660
application frames when something else happens in the system.

250
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,060
Network state change, a notification, et cetera.

251
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,320
This was a bad software architecture choice.

252
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,480
And digging out of that hole is going to take a long time.

253
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:28,320
I'm agnostic on whether it was wrong to move those into the same process as the compositor,

254
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,000
but the same thread was definitely wrong.

255
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,200
I'll keep working on the debugging tools to try to enable anyone to work on these problems,

256
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,200
though.

257
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,400
That's the folks at Purism.

258
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,880
Yeah, there are two reasons that this caught my attention.

259
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,960
One was obviously the Liebman 5, which Purism are working on, which is an ARM-based device,

260
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,960
not a massively high-end one.

261
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,740
But also, if you have been following the news about what Microsoft have been up to, they've

262
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,760
been shipping these ARM-based Windows laptops now.

263
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,920
And ARM is the future.

264
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,200
It's the present.

265
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,000
And x86, OK, that is still going to be around for professionals and developers.

266
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,100
There's a lot of people who are going to use that, but consumer machines are moving over

267
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,400
to ARM, I think.

268
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,280
And GNOME just doesn't seem to be suitable for those types of machines.

269
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,920
You know, I've been thinking about this, because we've been talking more and more about this.

270
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:28,480
And I think what we're witnessing is the conflux of a huge expansion in the GNOME user base

271
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,920
as 1804 and 1710 shipped, and the Ubuntu users moved over.

272
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,680
And we're also seeing this quicker and quicker pace towards ARM, and getting more and more

273
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,060
things to work on ARM systems.

274
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,800
And that's also exposing a bunch of issues.

275
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,600
And at the same time, we're moving to Wayland.

276
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,180
And that's making us rethink a whole bunch of architecture stuff.

277
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,340
And these things, these pressures, are all pushing against GNOME Shell at the same time

278
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,340
right now.

279
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,960
And something's got to give.

280
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:04,080
And it's resulting in a lot of conversation about performance, drawbacks, and limitations

281
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,420
of the design of GNOME.

282
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,560
And I don't know where we go from here, because right now, it's a massive desktop that's shipping

283
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,380
on pretty much every professional grade, quote, unquote, distro.

284
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,640
You don't know where we go from here?

285
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,320
Well, get my troll face on, plasma, surely, and cute, generally.

286
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,560
Yeah, although it does seem like the upstream market, the curators of the desktop have made

287
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
their decision.

288
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,480
And that's what GNOME and GTK, it is.

289
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,640
Thankfully, it's trivial.

290
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,080
For those of us who care to make a change, like I'm running plasma everywhere now.

291
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,080
Got family on it, too.

292
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,560
I've just gone crazy with how great it is.

293
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,940
I love it, love it, love it.

294
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,480
And it was a big refuge after getting very frustrated with my GNOME desktop.

295
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,180
I still think it's a great project.

296
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,640
And I really hope they do pull it out, because they have some great designers.

297
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,980
They have some great ideas.

298
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,780
And they have a ton of market momentum.

299
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,880
So just for the desktop to be successful, I hope they pull this thing out.

300
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,640
But in the meantime, yeah, I'm living in plasma land.

301
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,880
Last.ting.com.

302
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,960
It's smarter than unlimited.

303
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,520
When you use less, you pay less.

304
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,440
And when you need more, you just pay for what you use.

305
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,420
Your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes, whatever you use, that's what you pay for.

306
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,840
It's $6 per line.

307
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,500
You want one phone, $6 a month.

308
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,040
You want two phones, guess what, $12 a month.

309
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,040
It's really straightforward and simple.

310
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,040
You know, I almost always have about a $40 a month Ting bill.

311
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,560
And that's with several phones on my bill.

312
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,180
That's because I'm always on Wi-Fi.

313
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,220
And I don't like to make phone calls.

314
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,320
But on these road trips, I end up using some Ting data.

315
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,760
And it ends up being like $10 or $15 more that month.

316
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,480
But man, does that wash out across the 11 months that I'm not doing that.

317
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,560
And the thing about Ting is they have GSM and CDMA network.

318
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,580
And I like to use the best tool for the job.

319
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:52,560
And I came into the spot I'm parked in right now in Cortez, Colorado.

320
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,360
And I thought, for sure, it's going to be the GSM.

321
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,240
I'm going to go with the GSM signal.

322
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,480
I jumped on there.

323
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,840
And I had about a negative 110 dB.

324
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,200
It wasn't very great.

325
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,160
It was usable, though.

326
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,320
About 110 millisecond ping to the Google servers.

327
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,400
Not great for VoIP calls and doing shows.

328
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,920
So I thought, you know what, I'll just give the CDMA network a try.

329
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,720
I pop over.

330
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,560
I have a Nexus 6P.

331
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,720
So I pop over on my Nexus 6P on the CDMA network.

332
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,960
Heck, if I'm not getting negative 80 dB right now, and I've got full bars,

333
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,800
and Joe and I have been sitting here having this entire conversation

334
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,920
over my Nexus 6P on the Ting CDMA network tethered to my laptop.

335
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,520
And right now, I'm getting 50 milliseconds as I ping the Google DNS server.

336
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,400
I love the flexibility of Ting.

337
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,120
And as a small business owner who's on the road,

338
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,640
I would never go with anything else.

339
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:43,560
Having that choice between GSM and CDMA means the difference between us

340
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,400
having a smooth conversation or having a choppy show.

341
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,520
And that makes all the difference.

342
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,520
Check it out, lass.ting.com.

343
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:57,320
Let's talk about Huawei and them locking down their bootloaders.

344
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,360
Traditionally, Huawei have been pretty good with having their phones be unlockable,

345
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,360
and then you can flash all sorts of custom ROMs on them.

346
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,000
And they've always been fairly affordable as well.

347
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,880
So they've been quite popular among people who want to run things like LineageOS,

348
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,000
but don't necessarily want a flagship.

349
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,400
Well, that has all changed now because they've decided to not give people the codes

350
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,680
to unlock their bootloaders anymore.

351
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:25,560
And if you've got an existing device, then you've got under two months,

352
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,880
I think, at this stage to get one, and then they'll just cut you off

353
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,840
and any new devices won't get one.

354
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,720
So official advice if you want to run custom ROMs is don't buy a Huawei.

355
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
This seems like a really strange about face

356
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,040
because Huawei was considered one of the go-to brands for ROM flashing.

357
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,560
In fact, for years, they had forums open where people were discussing this.

358
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,280
They made it fairly easy to get the bootloader information

359
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,600
for each of the device.

360
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,840
They even had support pages that would go through the process of how to unlock.

361
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,320
And then things like about a month ago started to change.

362
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,520
The pages went away, and then you could email support,

363
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,600
and they would reply with some steps and maybe the unlock code that you needed.

364
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,160
And then that stopped, and then we have this official policy.

365
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,200
Anything sold after May 25, 2018, this is going to be the new policy going forward.

366
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
And I don't know what to make of this other than they

367
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,560
must have gotten burned somehow.

368
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,680
The support costs must have been too high, and they're making changes.

369
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,760
Or they were pressured into making a change.

370
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,120
I'd be curious to know what the audience's speculation is too.

371
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,680
What, are you speculating Google might have done this to them?

372
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,520
I don't know.

373
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,400
You've got this new update process that was announced at Google I.O.

374
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,480
That sounds pretty great.

375
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,480
We just talked about it, and there's some new requirements to sign.

376
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,640
Maybe there's some, I don't know, I'm just speculating.

377
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,880
But maybe there's some suggestions from Google to really secure the device

378
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,760
and make sure these updates are the right ones

379
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,720
and that people aren't getting malicious ROMs or something like that.

380
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,920
You have to make these steps.

381
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,080
And they could make a good case, and the larger consumer market

382
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,960
doesn't really care about this.

383
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,280
So that makes it a low risk change for them to make.

384
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:04,720
I don't know.

385
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,120
I don't like all the speculation.

386
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,480
I could be totally off base.

387
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,280
But something seems off here because it's a big change from dedicated support

388
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,080
pages on how to unlock devices to no more unlocked devices going forward,

389
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,120
hard stop.

390
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,200
Well, I think you hit the nail on the head in there

391
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,960
by saying that almost nobody cares about this.

392
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,480
I think the kind of people who are listening to this show probably do.

393
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:29,160
But the general public can't even conceive

394
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,000
of the idea of putting a different operating system or ROM on their phone.

395
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,880
They don't even know what that means.

396
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,920
And so the vast majority of people who would buy a cheap Huawei phone,

397
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,000
or even a high end one, they're just buying it to use as a phone.

398
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,160
And it's always seemed strange to me when people do that.

399
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,400
They buy a phone and just don't look whether it's

400
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,840
supported by lineage first before buying it and stuff.

401
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,400
But that's just what normal people do.

402
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,680
And so I don't think that they're going to lose any customers over there,

403
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,200
so very few customers.

404
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,840
And they obviously just don't value those customers.

405
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,600
See, that's where I think their mistake is.

406
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,920
That's a very valuable customer base because where do you

407
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,440
get any new ideas other than watching what

408
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,360
the fringe of your users are doing?

409
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,800
Watch the fringe user base.

410
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,640
See how they're pushing their devices.

411
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,160
See what crazy things they're adding to their custom ROMs

412
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,560
to make their devices better.

413
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,000
And then you, as an OEM, can sit back and watch that and cherry pick

414
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,320
the best ideas.

415
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,960
And then you integrate that into your product offerings

416
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,000
that you sell to all the mainstream consumers.

417
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,080
And boom, all of a sudden, you offer something

418
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,360
that's truly different than the rest of all of the other Android

419
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,080
handsets on the market.

420
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,040
And I don't know how you get there without supporting ROM communities.

421
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,480
I grant you, there's a support cost to supporting the ROM community

422
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,960
and making sure that stuff works.

423
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,920
And when their devices break and they try to make warranty claims,

424
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,200
there are costs there.

425
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,320
And perhaps they're great.

426
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,080
I don't know.

427
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,120
I doubt it if it's a small community to begin with.

428
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,000
It seems like the insights you get from them,

429
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,920
watching the things they do with their devices,

430
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,440
outweigh that support cost.

431
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,280
But what do I know?

432
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
I don't make phones.

433
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,800
Well, let me counter that by saying, first of all,

434
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,760
you don't have to be looking at the custom ROMs on your own phones

435
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,160
to see the innovation.

436
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,880
You could just buy a couple of pixels or whatever

437
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,160
and flash the latest ROMs and see what the community is doing

438
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,400
on other people's hardware.

439
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,840
And also, in terms of them being valuable customers, well,

440
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,440
not really.

441
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,840
Because the kind of person who's going to flash custom ROMs

442
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,600
on their phone are the kind of person who is not just

443
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,160
going to buy a new one all the time.

444
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,360
They're going to try and extend the life of it with custom ROMs.

445
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,480
So really, it makes sense that they

446
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,880
don't care about that portion of the market, I think.

447
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,520
Well, then we're all just going to have pixels.

448
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,840
See, somebody has to support these communities.

449
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,680
And somebody has to be the one watching them

450
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,640
to put those features forward.

451
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,760
So if they don't do it, somebody else will.

452
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,960
That's their loss.

453
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,920
And if what you say is true, then it

454
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,640
sounds like the lifespan of custom ROMs is limited anyways.

455
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,240
And they're just making the right move.

456
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,240
That's depressing, and I don't like it.

457
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,960
Well, speaking of depressing, Samsung

458
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,880
won a court case in the Netherlands.

459
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,280
And so now they're not going to be

460
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,960
forced to update their old phones for four years.

461
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,200
Isn't this something a consumer group

462
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,400
went after Samsung for not distributing updates

463
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,560
in a timely manner?

464
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,520
And their basic argument was Samsung

465
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,480
should be like a car manufacturer.

466
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,680
And if a car manufacturer is making so many models of cars

467
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,640
that they can't produce them safely,

468
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,960
then they should stop and produce fewer models

469
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,840
and variations of cars until they narrow the scope

470
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,000
to something that they can support properly.

471
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I thought that was an interesting argument.

472
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,400
They took that to the court.

473
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,120
And the judge said, thank you, but no thank you.

474
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,200
The court ruled in Samsung's favor

475
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,960
and said that the claims that were made by that consumer

476
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,000
group were inadmissible because they related to future acts

477
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
that Samsung may or may not make.

478
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,800
And we have no idea what the future holds.

479
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,120
So the judge said, go along, no thank you.

480
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,560
A very spurious argument, I think.

481
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,760
And it makes you wonder who had the better lawyers here.

482
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,680
You would imagine Samsung, obviously,

483
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,360
with all the money they've got.

484
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,720
I think Samsung's lawyers have better lawyers

485
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
than the consumer group's lawyers.

486
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,200
Probably.

487
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,520
But it's just a bad state of affairs, isn't it?

488
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,760
That loads of these manufacturers

489
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,560
sell these phones that never get updates.

490
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,400
And we seem to bang on about it all the time.

491
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,960
But this jumped out at me as a potential opportunity

492
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,720
to say to them, no, you can't get away with this.

493
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,680
You have to supply security updates at the minimum.

494
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,400
And they're just not interested in doing it.

495
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,840
And it seems that maybe the courts, in this case,

496
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,480
didn't understand the implications

497
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,000
of what they were talking about.

498
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
And maybe it was a bit beyond them.

499
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,440
Because I just don't see how they lost, really,

500
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,600
apart from that having the more expensive lawyers situation.

501
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,360
Well, see, Samsung sees it the other way.

502
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,320
They told the BBC that they were satisfied with that ruling

503
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,600
and that the judge has acknowledged

504
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,560
that Samsung is doing more than enough to ensure

505
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,480
safety of its products.

506
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,600
Stop right there, though.

507
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,160
It's interesting that this is starting

508
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,480
to be discussed more and more as a safety issue.

509
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,200
I think this should be looked at the way

510
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,740
you can have flaws in consumer electronics,

511
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,960
like a toaster that could catch your house on fire.

512
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,120
You can have flaws in your phone that

513
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,520
can expose your private information or your nudie pics.

514
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,880
And further, in that statement they released to the BBC,

515
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,640
they say, quote, it's a pity that the court route taken

516
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,320
by the consumer group has unjustly cast our update

517
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,520
policy in a negative light.

518
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,780
And the ruling shows that we take

519
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,280
the security of our smartphones we provide

520
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,000
to consumers very seriously.

521
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
So you see, Joe, Samsung says you're wrong.

522
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Yeah, I suppose I am wrong here.

523
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,440
And something we were definitely wrong about last week

524
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,840
is essential, they are not shutting down,

525
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,600
according to Andy Rubin's leaked email.

526
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,520
Yeah, definitely, definitely not shutting down.

527
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,960
I hope this is true.

528
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,800
I do know one rule about business financing,

529
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,600
and you can see lots of other business financing tip

530
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,560
experts sharing this information freely online.

531
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,360
You never say you're selling.

532
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,760
You never say that.

533
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,840
You can say you're raising funds.

534
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,320
You can say you're going to get a loan.

535
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,840
But you never say you're selling,

536
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,440
because then your value plummets,

537
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,920
and you're not going to get anything for the sale.

538
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,880
So the strategy, especially with Silicon Valley-type companies,

539
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,240
is to be fundraising.

540
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,280
And while you're fundraising, you might also then just

541
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,680
slip into sales discussions.

542
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,360
And you can see lots of people talking about this online,

543
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,920
so it's not really clear.

544
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,200
Because I saw that email that came out.

545
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,320
What Andy Rubin said in there was essentially,

546
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,360
we're not closing, but we are reconsidering

547
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,040
the entire product lineup, and we're

548
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,440
going to try to get a big fatty loan from the bank.

549
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,360
That could be, industry speak for,

550
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,920
all options are on the table.

551
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,260
Well, I hope that that's right.

552
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,040
I hope that all options are there,

553
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:01,240
including that they'll get some more financing

554
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,400
and make some more phones.

555
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,880
Because from everything I've heard about the Essential

556
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,320
Phone, it is pretty good.

557
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,560
And it is very developer-friendly,

558
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,800
and the complete opposite of Samsung

559
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,380
in terms of the security updates.

560
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,840
They're a model citizen, so it would be a real shame

561
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,080
if they were to go away.

562
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,960
Yeah, we did get some notes from some listeners

563
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,680
that have the Essential Phone, and they sold me on it.

564
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,880
I want one now.

565
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,840
So I hope they do keep making them,

566
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,000
because it sounded like a really good phone.

567
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,800
And like you said, too, they're the opposite

568
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,080
of what we just talked about with Samsung and Huawei.

569
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,120
They're very developer-friendly and community-friendly,

570
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,540
which you really have to appreciate,

571
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,740
especially from where we sit.

572
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,520
So hopefully, things are looking up.

573
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,400
Let us know what you think about anything we've

574
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,040
talked about today, including your take on any of the stories

575
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,800
at linuxactionnews.com slash contact.

576
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,200
And you mentioned that you're on the road, the road to Texas

577
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,160
Linux Fest.

578
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah, right now I'm just in the Four Corners

579
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,240
area of the United States.

580
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,160
But June 8 through the 9th, I'll be in the Austin area

581
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,280
at Texas Linux Fest.

582
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,840
We do have a telegram group set up.

583
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,520
If you want to join us, maybe grab some barbecue or just

584
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,680
hang out, jupitabroadcasting.com slash Texas.

585
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,320
And if you want to track where I'm at,

586
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,080
maybe meet up in the route there or on the way back,

587
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,800
jupitabroadcasting.com slash Rover,

588
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,900
where I have an embedded tracker for you and the NSA.

589
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,320
Which is how I knew you were near the Four Corners monument.

590
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,360
And the best way to get episodes every single week

591
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,240
is to go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe.

592

on the latest Linux on open source news.

596

I'm at chrislas.

597
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,400
