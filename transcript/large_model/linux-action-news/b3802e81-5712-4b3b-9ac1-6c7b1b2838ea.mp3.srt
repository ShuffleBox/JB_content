00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,200
This is episode 11, recorded on July 23rd, 2017.

3
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,200
And I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,200
And I'm Charlie.

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,160
Hey, Joe, it's good to be back with you.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,120
And I should say right off the top here, thank you to Mr. Ryan Sipes for filling in last

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,120
week.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,120
Joe, we have so many things to get into.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,200
Why don't we start with the death of what was surely the next big desktop OS.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,240
Remix OS, a desktop version of Android.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,240
Is it the death of it?

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
That's the question.

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,460
It's the death of it as we know it.

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,360
So it was made by a company called Jide, who had a couple of Kickstarters for a tablet

15
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,360
and then a mini desktop PC.

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,000
I've actually got that, the Remix Mini, the desktop PC.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Really?

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What do you think of it?

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,760
I think that it was OK, but then they abandoned it like all Android OEMs do.

20
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,200
Which is often not their fault because it's down to the components inside it get abandoned

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,440
by the upstream hardware manufacturers.

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,120
So there's not a lot they can do really.

23
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,720
But it's an interesting concept.

24
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,040
But I just feel that it never really took off, did it?

25
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,600
This idea of Android with a panel and floating windows that you can resize.

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,840
Yeah, so their whole approach here was you could take Android x86, toss it on a laptop

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,200
or something like that of your choice, and run Android applications in windowed mode

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,440
with a menued launcher.

29
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,160
And they did several Kickstarters.

30
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,920
In fact, some backers are still waiting for their product, but we'll talk about that more

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,200
in just a moment.

32
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,600
But here's what they discovered.

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,760
They built some of these consumer products, they got them in the hands of some consumers,

34
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,840
and an interesting customer came knocking.

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,840
The enterprise.

36
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,800
And they say that over the past year, they've received an increasing number of inquiries

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,760
from enterprises in various industries and began helping them build great tools for their

38
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,360
organizations by leveraging giant software and hardware.

39
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
What does that mean?

40
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
What do you think?

41
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,060
Read between the lines on that.

42
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:22,120
Can you seriously expect enterprise to move away from Windows to an Android based OS?

43
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,480
I didn't take it as that.

44
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,020
So I've had an interesting realization while traveling recently to Montana and having a

45
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,360
few conversations with people at the campsites, and also with my trip to Dell.

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,560
There is really cool future tech in these enterprises in really weird ways, like often

47
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,480
like in the common areas in the cafeteria, for example, at Dell, they have a Linux powered

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,400
automated barista robot thing that you go up there, you order from your smartphone,

49
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,380
and then it just delivers you a robot makes you a perfect cup of coffee, and delivers

50
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,000
it to you.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,480
At Pixar, everything you buy everything with your badge, and it's been that way for a decade.

52
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,520
Payment, wireless tap payment has been available in cafeterias in enterprises for a decade.

53
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,480
And we're just now getting it here in the States as consumers.

54
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,120
And all of these different devices are powered by different types of operating systems.

55
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,240
And I could see different enterprises that would need particular types of handheld devices,

56
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:26,040
or dedicated machines that are very purpose built, that they would contract to Jyde, Jyde

57
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,840
would do that work for them and deliver a product and then maintain it for a for a maintenance

58
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,840
fee.

59
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,720
And it's gonna be way more profitable than the consumer space.

60
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,240
If I was like, if Jyde hired Chris, the consultant, and I came in there to advise them, I would

61
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,880
tell them, focus on businesses, this is where you're going to make your money.

62
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,060
So what you're saying to me is that they've proven that they can take Android and make

63
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,280
it into a desktop OS, and in that same way, they can take it and turn it into whatever

64
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,840
you want, not necessarily a desktop OS, and probably almost definitely not.

65
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,880
It would be having some sort of custom interface to do a certain job.

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,740
Yeah, and it could even be things that are, you know, just purpose built for a large conference

67
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:12,860
setup or a hotel that wants to have a smart controller in the room and, or, or, you know,

68
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,920
they want to revamp all their business centers with a branded desktop experience.

69
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,520
They could see all kinds of uses for something like this.

70
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,980
And they say, as a result, they're going to restructure their business and transition

71
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,040
away from the consumer space.

72
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,280
As a result, all development on existing products, such as remix OS for PCs, as well as products

73
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,040
in the pipeline, such as remix IO, and the IO plus will be discontinued, which were successfully

74
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,600
funded, I think.

75
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Yeah.

76
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,320
And if you did fund it, then you're going to get a refund, they promise.

77
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,360
Which I think now we've had this discussion, I feel more confident that people will get

78
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,000
their refunds because now it's kind of all fallen into place for me.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,060
Maybe they did this remix OS thing to prove that they had the software engineering chops

80
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,600
to do something decent.

81
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,040
And maybe their long-term goal wasn't necessarily to do desktop only with Android.

82
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,120
It was basically to prove that they can compete with, because there are a ton of other companies

83
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,520
out there who can take Android and customize it, and maybe even make just a completely

84
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,680
bespoke OS for what is essentially, well, it's not really Internet of Things, but it's

85
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,360
certainly embedded devices.

86
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,000
And maybe that's what this whole thing's been about for them, just making a big name for

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
themselves.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,700
It's either that, Joe, or they realized which way the wind was blowing pretty quick and

89
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:37,600
somebody savvy said, we got to pivot, quote unquote, and make this move to survive.

90
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,360
And they're just, they're executing.

91
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Yeah, maybe.

92
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Yeah.

93
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
Maybe that's what it's about.

94
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,880
However, despite all of this, from the ashes rises Phoenix OS.

95
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,720
I actually don't think this is too new.

96
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,360
This has been sort of a competitor that's been brewing for a little while.

97
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,600
It's kind of a boost for them.

98
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,800
Yeah, well, this is a Chinese distro, which is very Chinese when you look at it.

99
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,400
The thing about remix OS was that it, although Jai do a Chinese company, I think, it was

100
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,400
a very generic, almost stock Android feeling OS that had the Play Store for a while.

101
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,160
And then they kind of had to rip that out, but you could put it back in.

102
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,400
Whereas Phoenix OS is very much for the Chinese market.

103
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:26,800
I think you can boot it up into an English mode, but it's a lot of the applications are

104
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,360
their names for them are Chinese characters and it doesn't have the Play Store.

105
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,480
And it's ostensibly similar to remix OS, but it just feels very much not for the Western

106
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,440
market to me.

107
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,720
They've just recently released Phoenix OS 2.1, which includes not only a bunch of bug

108
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,100
fixes and hardware compatibility, but they've also now included an updated keyboard mapping

109
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:56,000
feature which will help you position these windowed touchscreen applications around your

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,800
screen without actually having to raise your hand from the keyboard up to the screen.

111
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,960
That's a solid feature.

112
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,880
You look at it just from a screenshot perspective, Joe, and I swear, at really first glance,

113
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,240
it almost looks like Windows 10 with a classic Windows theme.

114
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,240
Yeah, that's reasonably fair, kind of Windows 10 meets Chrome OS, I suppose.

115
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Yeah.

116
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,160
And so I tried to give this a pretty solid go.

117
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,200
I wanted to just sort of kick the tires and get an idea of what it was like because it

118
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,280
crossed my mind, if I could put this on a machine where I could get hardware acceleration,

119
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,140
maybe I could install a couple of Android games on my laptop.

120
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,960
So I have the Dell XPS 13.

121
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:38,880
I tried to load it on the Dell XPS 13 with both UEFI turned on, secure boot was off,

122
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,440
and in legacy boot mode, couldn't get it to load.

123
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,800
I tried to load it in VMware and in VirtualBox, couldn't get it to load the graphical environment.

124
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,120
I got it to boot, couldn't get it to load the graphical environment.

125
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,840
Tried it on a Dell Precision laptop, same story.

126
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,360
Legacy mode, UEFI, didn't matter, wouldn't even boot on the system.

127
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,840
So I tried it across several pieces of hardware, and I was just sort of left underwhelmed.

128
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,080
Were you able to get it going?

129
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,800
Yeah, so I tried downloading the ISO first.

130
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
That's what I did, yeah.

131
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,460
Yeah, I DDed it to a stick, and it just didn't work, basically, so I thought, okay, so the

132
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:24,440
other alternative is they've got a large EXE, which is essentially the ISO with a bit of

133
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,680
Windows software that will install it.

134
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
It's weird.

135
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,960
So I've got a few Windows partitions lying around on various machines, and so I chucked

136
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:40,880
it on Windows 7, and what it does is it basically adds it to the Windows boot list.

137
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,200
I don't know enough about Windows to know exactly how it works, but it's the equivalent

138
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
of grub within Windows.

139
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,680
Yeah, like your boot.ini file is how it used to be in Windows, at least.

140
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,660
Yeah, I think, yeah, that's kind of it.

141
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:58,000
And so you have to boot from grub into Windows, and then you've got the choice of either Windows

142
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,160
or Phoenix OS, and that worked, well, it kind of worked, but it wouldn't get the video

143
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,680
mode right because the box I was doing it on was my projector, which is, I've ever told

144
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
you about that.

145
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,760
It's pretty sweet, my Gigabyte bricks projector.

146
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,600
You have a machine hooked up to a projector?

147
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,400
No, no, the machine is a projector, so it's a Gigabyte bricks, right, which is basically

148
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,680
an Intel NUC rip-off, right?

149
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,720
So it's an i3, it came as an i3 bare-bones, I just put four gigs of RAM in it and a small

150
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,720
SSD, and so you can plug it in with HDMI, and it's just a regular desktop PC, but it's

151
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,880
got a built-in projector, and so it's pretty low-res is the only thing, it's a Pico projector,

152
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,880
and so you can run that totally independently, so you can project the operating system that

153
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,800
you're running on there, but that, because it's quite low-res and the screen that I plugged

154
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:58,600
into was 1080p, it kind of confused it a little bit, so that didn't work out, but you can

155
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,960
make a USB stick out of the EXE as well, which I did, and then I booted that on my main test

156
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,040
laptop and that worked absolutely fine.

157
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
How does it look?

158
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,400
Does it perform okay?

159
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
What was your takeaway?

160
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,120
Well, I only had a little bit of time to look at it, but yeah, it's pretty solid, it works

161
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,080
pretty well as you'd expect, I mean I've got a fair amount of experience with Android X86,

162
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:27,400
which of course is similar to it, but is just a standard touch interface, which is not well

163
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,400
suited to keyboard and mouse at all.

164
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,840
So this just feels similar performance-wise, but it didn't have the Play Store, so I couldn't

165
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,720
really check out many of the apps that I'm used to, it just kind of has their built-in

166
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,720
ones.

167
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,200
Well, you could always enjoy F-Droid, I suppose.

168
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,840
Yeah, I should do that really.

169
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,200
As I said on Late Night Linux recently, I'm a bit over it really, the whole Android as

170
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,040
a desktop, I just think that it had its chance and the applications that you can run on it

171
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,120
just haven't really delivered.

172
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,280
This is how I feel as well.

173
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,880
That's why you need to strap it to your face.

174
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,160
If you're a Google Enterprise partner, they have a second iteration that they're beginning

175
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,440
to sell right now.

176
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,600
They say they have tested and deployed across many factories in the United States by companies

177
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:20,600
such as Boeing, GE, DHL, and while I was in Montana, sitting right next to me, at the

178
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,920
very moment, Mr. Noah Chalaya got an invitation to join the Google Glass Enterprise program

179
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,360
and he signed up immediately.

180
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,640
So there you go, Joe, maybe you just need to strap it to your face.

181
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,880
Yeah, good thinking.

182
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,980
This is a real interesting one, man, because Google Glass, I went to an event in London,

183
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:44,520
it must have been four years ago, maybe five years ago, where they were displaying it and

184
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,000
you could try it out and stuff and I thought, yeah, this is really cool.

185
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,480
And then you go to buy it and it was a thousand pounds, I was like, whoa, if this was like

186
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,160
a hundred and fifty pounds, maybe I'd be thinking about it because it felt very beta.

187
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,700
And then it just didn't do very well and it seemingly died.

188
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:09,480
And then do you recall, it must be a month or two months ago, there was a story that

189
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,960
these Google Glass sets, I don't know, devices, I suppose you'd say, had received an update.

190
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,840
Yeah, yeah, I think it was back in March, there was an NPR report and then Wired recently

191
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
just wrote about it.

192
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:27,040
So there's been some rumors about it, but it has shifted because that was testing and

193
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,920
now they're actually emailing former Google Glass customers and saying, come one, come

194
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,160
all, come buy the new Google Glass, but first talk to us for the price.

195
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,120
So when I was sitting next to Noah, he's sitting there signing up, becoming a Google Enterprise

196
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,400
partner, and through all of this process, he still was not told what the price of Google

197
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Glass was.

198
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,000
They're going to contact him.

199
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,560
But they say they've made major upgrades from the original one.

200
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,840
The Enterprise has a much better camera, it's an eight megapixel from five now, they've

201
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,640
improved the battery life, they put faster Wi-Fi chips in there, a better processor,

202
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,120
and they've added a recording video light that all of you guys are going to have to

203
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,680
figure out how to hack off that turns on when you're recording video.

204
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,360
Google also says that they have made the electronics modular and they've created a so-called glass

205
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:18,280
pod, which can be detached and then reattached to glass compatible frames, so maybe more

206
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:23,160
stylish frames or maybe protective lenses depending on the application.

207
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,160
And they say that it'll be easier to work with prescription lenses as well, which makes

208
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
a ton of sense.

209
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,760
And they're all in, they went out of their way.

210
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,160
The project lead said this is not an experiment, it was an experiment three years ago, this

211
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:42,200
is now full-on production with our customers and our partners, hoorah, I have that part.

212
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,160
Yeah, this is a real surprise to me.

213
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,580
It turns out they've been working on this for at least a couple of years and testing

214
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,400
it in various factories and enterprises.

215
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,480
And that suddenly makes sense, doesn't it?

216
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,240
Because the idea of it as a consumer product, it was never going to take off, but you suddenly

217
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,400
put it in this industrial application where people are making things in factories.

218
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:11,440
The example in this wide article was an airplane parts factory and usually, or before they

219
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,960
got this, they had to reference laptops or paper or whatever and it was really slowing

220
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
them down.

221
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,080
Whereas this has just made them so much more efficient to be able to pull up either through

222
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,780
touch or voice the various instructions for the next bit that they need to do.

223
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,880
And it just suddenly makes so much more sense, doesn't it?

224
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,340
And for consumers, there is still some practicality to it, but I bet Google's going to let other

225
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,400
people dabble in that.

226
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,600
There's some implications here about hardware partners.

227
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,360
So we may see other manifestations of Google Glass, but right now what they're targeting

228
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,720
as a direct sale, I agree, Joe, it makes a ton of sense, especially if you can build

229
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,360
apps for this thing that are purpose-built for your business, it could kind of be obvious

230
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,460
at that point.

231
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,040
Can you believe that we're sitting here talking about Google Glass in 2017?

232
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
I didn't expect it.

233
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,400
Yeah, although in some ways it seems like they were a little bit ahead of the game because

234
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,480
now AR is all the rage.

235
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,040
Yeah, that's true.

236
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,360
And this is a very lightweight version of that.

237
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,760
Instead of having a huge headset over you, it's just in the corner of your eye.

238
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,160
I mean, I presume you've checked out Noah's one.

239
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
Yeah.

240
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,120
And he'd tell you that the most useful feature is actually the ability to take a quick picture

241
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
of stuff.

242
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,720
He uses it as his digital memory because he has the memory of a goldfish.

243
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,040
He'd be the first person to tell you that.

244
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,320
So he can take pictures of stuff and then combines it with Google Photos, has it upload

245
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,560
to Google Photos.

246
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,840
And then two days later when he needs to remember, he's just, oh, I think it was a red box.

247
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,960
And so he says, this is a conversation we had.

248
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,200
He'll just go type in red box in the Google Photos and all of the red boxes show up.

249
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,080
And oh yeah, that's the thing I was trying to remember.

250
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,240
There it is.

251
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,900
And for him, that was, he described it as this.

252
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,400
That made it so that he genuinely, because he hasn't used Google Glass now for months,

253
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:57,000
he genuinely feels that there was a time in his life before Google Glass and after Google

254
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,040
Glass because it made such an improvement in his productivity.

255
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,920
I don't know if that's true or not.

256
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,920
I have not experienced that level of improvement with Google Glass when I tried it, but I tried

257
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,760
it for a very limited amount of time.

258
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,240
He was so on board that he immediately signed up to get the new version.

259
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Yeah.

260
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,040
Well, this is not the last we're going to be hearing of this, I don't think.

261
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,720
I think we're going to be talking about it over the months and years ahead.

262
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
I agree.

263
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,240
Something we might be talking about a lot less very soon.

264
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,280
In fact, sooner than I think either you or I thought even, is Firefox.

265
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,600
This is a devastating piece that was posted by the former CTO of Mozilla, sort of a follow-up

266
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,840
piece to something we've covered before.

267
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,520
And when I read through this, my heart sank a little bit.

268
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
Yeah.

269
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,720
The previous piece was called Chrome 1, I think, or Chrome was 1, and basically analyzed

270
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:52,280
some data by stat counter that was very damning of Firefox in terms of user numbers.

271
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,640
And this is a follow-up piece where he's actually looked at some of the data from Mozilla, their

272
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,320
public data, and it really does not look good.

273
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,840
If you look at the chart of it, it's kind of just very much a downward spiral.

274
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,040
And I think what's most interesting about this is not, I mean, we all knew that Firefox

275
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,840
was tanking in terms of user numbers, but it's why.

276
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:22,920
And it's when he goes into the why of it and he posts some screenshots here of people using

277
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:30,960
Google products like Gmail, YouTube, even Google search and Google calendar and just

278
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,760
constant nags to install Chrome.

279
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
Yeah.

280
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
I've seen it.

281
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
You've seen it probably.

282
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Yeah.

283
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,120
It's like, stop telling me about this.

284
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,820
And that's what I always say, but it's free advertising.

285
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:50,160
It's probably hundreds of millions of dollars worth of free advertising for their browser.

286
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,340
It's really invaluable because they don't offer that advertising space to anyone else

287
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,240
because it's the very top of their most premium products like Gmail and YouTube and Google

288
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,220
Docs and Google Calendar.

289
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,540
They don't sell ads in that space.

290
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,480
It's literally invaluable space.

291
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
Yeah.

292
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,760
And, well, the guy who I set up a laptop for, he's quite old.

293
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,520
And then I go back there, you know, I set him up an XP machine basically, and he's been

294
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,600
used to using Internet Explorer.

295
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,240
So I just thought, well, let's not rock the boat, set him up with that.

296
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,240
I go back a few months later and he's using Chrome.

297
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,880
I said, how come you're using Chrome?

298
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,160
He said, I just thought it was an update.

299
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,160
Interesting.

300
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,280
Obviously this had happened to him.

301
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,720
It had popped up, hey, upgrade.

302
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,840
They use words like that.

303
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
Upgrade to Chrome.

304
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,880
Improve your experience.

305
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,880
Watch YouTube.

306
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,320
Get special offline Google Calendar access.

307
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,320
Yeah.

308
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,680
To get Calendar offline, upgrade to Chrome.

309
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,880
And so that kind of language to an inexperienced user, if they've had it drummed into them

310
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,640
by someone technical like me, always do your updates, always do upgrades, then they're

311
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,400
just going to instinctively do it.

312
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,480
And that's why they've driven this massive adoption to Chrome.

313
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
Yeah.

314
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
Yep.

315
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,120
And really to drive this point home, just look at the data from the last year.

316
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,760
Firefox has lost 16 million installs in the last year.

317
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:20,600
22% fewer Firefox desktop installs are active today than a year ago.

318
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,520
And what's kind of ironic about that, and this post also makes this point, is that the

319
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:33,680
last year has seen some of the most innovative, interesting development technically in Firefox's

320
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,120
history for years.

321
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,840
So while Firefox is making changes that are, from an engineering standpoint, some of their

322
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,680
best work in years, their usage is continuing to decline.

323
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,600
Well, they just can't compete, can they?

324
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,200
It's not an even playing field is the bottom line.

325
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,440
And that's when you get things like EU competition laws coming into place.

326
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,960
And I don't know how to feel about that.

327
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:04,200
I mean, I'm reasonably libertarian in as far as you don't have to use Google services,

328
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,840
and therefore you don't have to be advertised to for the other Google products.

329
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,320
And getting them, I probably shouldn't get too political like this, but this idea of

330
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,880
them being penalized for promoting their own shopping services on their own search engine.

331
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,200
Well, use Yahoo or use Bing if that's a problem to you.

332
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,800
Yeah, I kind of agree with you on that.

333
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,040
But you also have to look at this position that Firefox is in.

334
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,000
It's not an engineering problem.

335
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,840
This is clearly not because in some ways they're really cleaning up their past engineering

336
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,840
issues.

337
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,440
It is truly a market disruption problem.

338
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,480
It's a desktop to mobile shift, and it's a Google monopoly problem with their monopoly

339
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,480
on search.

340
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,960
There's literally no engineering solution that Firefox can come up with to fix this

341
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,960
issue.

342
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,120
It is a huge problem because Google needs to grow as a publicly traded company.

343
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,480
They're going to continue to have to grow, and the web is becoming more and more stagnant,

344
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,880
and they have to leverage their unique platforms to sell their own products.

345
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,120
It's their only option for growth at this point, and it's too tempting for them to refuse.

346
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,000
So there's really nothing that can be done because they're always going to find a way

347
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,180
to do this regardless of what the EU does or anybody else.

348
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,840
And the thing is, this isn't like the days of IE.

349
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,320
Google's still hungry.

350
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:28,680
Google still wants to push the web forward, so they continue to advance Chrome at a breakneck

351
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,440
pace.

352
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,160
And that's not like when Firefox first came around and IE was dominant.

353
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,320
It was stagnant, and Microsoft wasn't being competitive.

354
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,080
But Chrome is not standing still, and Google is active in the web standards bodies, and

355
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,800
they're actively integrating technologies that they believe in into Chrome and pushing

356
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,000
that across their widely used platforms.

357
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,860
It's not the same landscape that Firefox came into.

358
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,400
It's a totally different competitor now, and it's one that has literally the home field

359
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,640
advantage.

360
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,600
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

361
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:10,640
Go there to sign up for a free seven-day trial and support Linux Action News and learn more

362
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
about Linux.

363
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,040
It's a super great platform built by Linux enthusiasts with all kinds of features built

364
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:21,700
in that Linux users would expect, hands-on labs with scenario-based training, servers

365
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,020
that spin up on demand when you need them.

366
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,540
You preselect the distribution you want for the courseware, and the server that spins

367
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,640
up will match that selection, and then you just SSH in and work on the command line in

368
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,760
a scenario-based lab.

369
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,840
That's great when you're learning AWS, too.

370
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,820
If you're busy, they have a course scheduler that lets you stick to a time frame and works

371
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,940
with you to find content.

372
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,240
And they have learning paths if you want to go deep into something specifically.

373
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,560
And my favorite feature, instructor mentoring.

374
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,120
Real human beings whenever you need it.

375
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
There's so much more.

376
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,200
Just go to Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to sign up for a free seven-day trial and

377
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,520
support this show, Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

378
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,960
Now someone who seems to come up almost every week on this show is Alan Pope, or Popey as

379
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,040
he's better known, friend of the show.

380
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,560
And this week he's posted on his blog the Ubuntu Artful Desktop July Shakedown.

381
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:21,160
And so this is encouraging people to download the daily images of 17.10 and test them and

382
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,760
report bugs because it's halfway through the cycle now.

383
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,040
I can't believe that we're halfway to the 17.10 release.

384
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:35,080
And obviously this is a major release in terms of it's got a whole new desktop that Ubuntu

385
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,860
is moving over to GNOME now instead of Unity.

386
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,000
And so there's a lot to test.

387
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,280
And interestingly, he's not saying you should do what they call the full ISO testing, which

388
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,640
is really, really involved.

389
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,120
This is more user-friendly, I suppose.

390
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
This is more-

391
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
Day-to-day.

392
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
Yeah.

393
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:55,000
He's looking for people to say log in and try using Ubuntu on Wayland sessions for normal

394
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,800
day-to-day activities and file bugs.

395
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,080
Check out suspend and resume.

396
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,100
Make sure everything still works as you expect it.

397
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:06,360
Try out external network cards and dongles and maybe external displays.

398
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Connect Bluetooth devices.

399
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,600
They've done a lot of work on Bluetooth and try out some of that stuff and see that everything

400
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,920
works as expected.

401
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,560
Just really kind of the stuff that impacts your day-to-day use of the desktop.

402
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
Yeah.

403
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:21,840
I really want to test that Bluetooth stuff because I can't be alone here.

404
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,560
Bluetooth in Linux is just a disaster.

405
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,320
I use Bluetooth every day with my phone because I have a little receiver, I suppose you'd

406
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
call it.

407
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
It's got a mic on it as well.

408
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,200
It's not Bluetooth headphones that you plug your headphones into this little square Sony

409
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
thing.

410
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,880
I use it every day for listening to podcasts and music and when I'm driving to make phone

411
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,880
calls and stuff like that, but on a Linux desktop, forget about it.

412
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,640
It just seems to never work or if it does work, it'll work for a bit and then just drop

413
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,640
out.

414
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,840
I have a Bluetooth speaker that I can only get to work the first time I've paired it

415
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,800
and every time I want it to work after that, I have to delete the pairing and then repair

416
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,480
the device as if it were new and then it will work during that session only.

417
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,480
Yeah.

418
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,800
As we know, wired audio is dead.

419
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,840
We live in a, what was it?

420
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,380
Not brave.

421
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:15,960
What was the word that Apple used for their decision to drop the headphone jack?

422
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
Courageous.

423
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
Yeah.

424
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
Courage.

425
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
We are moving to that world, aren't we?

426
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,200
Bluetooth is just so much more convenient.

427
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,400
If Ubuntu can blaze the trail on that, then I really, really hope they can and make it

428
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,400
work really well.

429
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,080
I'm keen to get testing on this.

430
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,760
I've been really busy with work and podcasting, so I haven't done any tests on these latest

431
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,720
images yet, but I'll do that this week when I've got some time and hopefully report any

432
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:46,360
bugs that I find and try and make this Bluetooth thing better because I'd like to see other

433
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,400
distros and other desktops take advantage of the work that they're doing here.

434
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,400
It's long overdue.

435
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Yeah.

436
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,520
Boy, do I agree with that.

437
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,380
This is looking like a massive release.

438
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:04,400
The biggest we've seen in years, years, maybe since 1204, maybe.

439
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I would really encourage people to take a look at this.

440
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,240
Also, I'm just going to give a quick plug to friend of the show, Martin Wimpress, the

441
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,720
Ubuntu Mate Spin of 1710 also looking amazing.

442
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:23,920
We could be looking at a series of massively significant releases on the Ubuntu side of

443
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,880
things in October.

444
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,760
Getting to get a little bit excited about this.

445
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:33,560
That's kind of unusual because normally you'd only really get excited about the LTS releases

446
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,360
because that's something you're actually going to use long term, whereas you're only going

447
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,680
to use the 1710 release for a few months, but it's going to be so different, isn't it,

448
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,200
from the previous one?

449
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,040
Let's face it, since what, 1404, basically nothing's changed in mainline Ubuntu.

450
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,880
I'm really glad they're doing this work now.

451
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,720
They're taking big changes in risks right now so that way when 1804 lands, they've got

452
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,520
a lot of this stuff ironed out and along those lines, Dustin Kirkland of Canonical recently

453
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:11,840
posted an Ubuntu 1804 LTS desktop default application survey and it's been posted in

454
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,960
several places around the web trying to get a feel for what people want to see in future

455
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,960
releases.

456
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,400
They say we already have beta code for 17 available for testing, but let's look forward

457
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,440
a little bit.

458
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,120
What do you want to see as the default applications in the future?

459
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,920
Yes, I filled this in on Reddit and I think my answers speak volumes about what I want.

460
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:37,400
I said terminal, XFCE4 terminal, file manager, Thunar.

461
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,400
No.

462
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,400
Yeah, of course.

463
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,340
The question is what are you using and that's what I'm using.

464
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,760
What did you say for web browser?

465
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
Firefox.

466
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
Yeah.

467
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
There's no point saying Chrome.

468
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
They can't ship it.

469
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,040
Maybe that's why I saw so many Firefox answers.

470
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,800
I saw, I would say, the majority of people saying Firefox and then maybe Chromium.

471
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,000
Yeah, Chromium, but again, that's not as free as people think.

472
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:08,120
The downloads stuff in the background, I think really your only option is to ship Firefox

473
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,400
and enable people to then install Chrome easily, facilitate it.

474
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,480
Yeah, that makes sense.

475
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,240
To me, this does though feel like old school Ubuntu.

476
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,920
Really kind of just getting in with the community and saying, well, what does it take to make

477
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,720
the best Debian desktop?

478
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,160
Only now it's what does it take to make the best Ubuntu desktop?

479
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,480
They're asking questions that I feel like they were asking a long time ago.

480
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,480
They're asking those same questions again and it's going to be interesting to see what

481
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,200
the results are because sometimes you get results you didn't expect.

482
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,020
I honestly expected Chrome or Chromium and we're seeing a lot of Firefox stuff, but tons

483
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,160
of people are saying file manager, just use Nautilus.

484
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,720
They're just saying go with the defaults on a lot of this stuff.
