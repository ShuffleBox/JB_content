00:00.000 --> 00:16.200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.200 --> 00:21.200
This is episode 89, recorded on January 20th, 2019.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.200
I'm Chris.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.200
And I'm Joe.

00:23.200 --> 00:24.200
Hello, Joe.

00:24.200 --> 00:28.400
It's good to be connected with you and let's kick things off with a story that just keeps

00:28.400 --> 00:31.880
taking twist after turn after twist.

00:31.880 --> 00:35.880
It's almost like a piece of fiction at this point.

00:35.880 --> 00:41.680
It's the long twisted story of MongoDB and the bit of rejection it's getting from major

00:41.680 --> 00:43.560
Linux distributions this week.

00:43.560 --> 00:48.020
Yeah, it all started when they changed their license to the server side public license,

00:48.020 --> 00:50.000
the SSPL.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.300
And then last week we reported on Amazon rolling their own MongoDB compatible database called

00:56.300 --> 01:01.040
DocumentDB, and now it's gone from bad to worse for MongoDB because it's being removed

01:01.040 --> 01:03.760
from a few major distros.

01:03.760 --> 01:09.440
Yeah, so the ball really got rolling when both Fedora and Debian announced they would

01:09.440 --> 01:12.640
no longer be including it in their distribution.

01:12.640 --> 01:17.920
And the quote from Tom Calloway over at Fedora is this, it is the belief of Fedora that the

01:17.920 --> 01:24.880
SSPL is intentionally crafted to be aggressively discriminatory towards a specific class of

01:24.880 --> 01:25.880
users.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.320
Well, it's not an open source license, is it?

01:28.320 --> 01:30.600
So they can't have it in open source projects.

01:30.600 --> 01:33.360
Well, the MongoDB logic kind of goes like this.

01:33.360 --> 01:36.680
This is a quote from their CTO and co-founder.

01:36.680 --> 01:41.480
And Elliot explained, we believe that in today's world, linking has been superseded by the

01:41.480 --> 01:46.800
provision of programs as services and the connection of programs over networks as the

01:46.800 --> 01:52.120
main form of a program combination, where the GPL and all that, a lot of open source

01:52.120 --> 01:54.920
licenses are really built around the idea of if you link to them.

01:54.920 --> 01:57.560
But linking, they argue, is going away.

01:57.560 --> 02:01.760
And re-hosting things and connecting to it over the network is the new normal.

02:01.760 --> 02:07.280
He goes on to say, it is unclear whether existing copyleft licenses clearly apply to this form

02:07.280 --> 02:09.120
of program combination.

02:09.120 --> 02:14.320
And we intended the SSPL to be an option for developers to address this uncertainty.

02:14.320 --> 02:16.220
Well, that is fair enough.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.680
They do make a lot of good points.

02:18.680 --> 02:22.860
But that doesn't change the fact that the way they've chosen to solve this problem is

02:22.860 --> 02:27.440
by making a license that isn't open source.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.740
And so these distros have no other choice but to remove it.

02:30.740 --> 02:36.000
Talk about a rock and a hard place with MongoDB here, because they have the open source community

02:36.000 --> 02:41.360
in the form of the distributions, essentially being forced to turn their backs on MongoDB.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.980
And at the same time, on the commercial end of the spectrum, you've got companies like

02:44.980 --> 02:51.040
Amazon launching DocumentDB, which gives a very compelling commercial alternative to

02:51.040 --> 02:52.480
MongoDB.

02:52.480 --> 02:56.200
It's a rough time to be that project right now and to be that company.

02:56.200 --> 03:03.080
Well, except that you do have to ask, is anybody who's running a serious instance of MongoDB

03:03.080 --> 03:09.520
really using the version in the repos of their distro, or are they using the MongoDB repos?

03:09.520 --> 03:14.400
And realistically, that's probably the case with these major deployments.

03:14.400 --> 03:20.280
So removing it from these distros isn't going to be a huge issue for a lot of the bigger

03:20.280 --> 03:22.560
enterprise installations.

03:22.560 --> 03:26.400
So maybe they're not that bothered, but I don't know, maybe it will hurt adoption in

03:26.400 --> 03:27.400
the first place.

03:27.400 --> 03:31.360
It seems like an opportunity for a snap package, Joe.

03:31.360 --> 03:32.360
Yeah.

03:32.360 --> 03:37.240
Well, we don't know whether it's going to actually be removed from Ubuntu yet, but it

03:37.240 --> 03:39.760
sort of seems fairly likely that it will.

03:39.760 --> 03:45.960
Although with the ZFS thing, they've put that in Ubuntu and got away with it, for want of

03:45.960 --> 03:46.960
a better word.

03:46.960 --> 03:47.960
True.

03:47.960 --> 03:48.960
It's not in main Debian.

03:48.960 --> 03:52.760
Well, much like Fedora pulling, it means it's getting pulled from RHEL.

03:52.760 --> 03:57.080
It seems pretty likely that if it's getting pulled from the repository, it's probably

03:57.080 --> 04:00.040
getting pulled from downstream Ubuntu.

04:00.040 --> 04:04.640
But you're right, they have shown in the past, they're perfectly happy adding their own thing

04:04.640 --> 04:06.080
and doing their own thing.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.960
So it's possible it'll stick around.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.240
Or they might use this opportunity to snap it up.

04:10.240 --> 04:12.480
I mean, really, it does seem like a perfect opportunity.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.480
Yeah.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.860
And then it'll be available on multiple distros.

04:15.860 --> 04:20.120
So you'd be able to get it relatively easily in Fedora, for example.

04:20.120 --> 04:25.160
Well speaking of ZFS on Linux, there has been a lot of ups and downs recently.

04:25.160 --> 04:29.580
So we covered all of the projects rebasing on the ZFS on Linux implementation.

04:29.580 --> 04:31.200
That was huge news.

04:31.200 --> 04:36.000
But then shortly after that, news came out that in the new 5.0 version of Linux, the

04:36.000 --> 04:41.280
new kernel, the ZFS on Linux project could no longer build due to some kernel changes

04:41.280 --> 04:43.040
that were made by the core developers.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.040
Yeah.

04:44.040 --> 04:47.640
So we're getting short of hostility coming from Greg Kh regarding ZFS.

04:47.640 --> 04:48.640
Hostility?

04:48.640 --> 04:49.640
Yeah, okay.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.280
I mean, definitely annoyance.

04:51.280 --> 04:56.080
There was lines in there like, my tolerance for ZFS is pretty non-existent.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.760
That's pretty straightforward.

04:57.760 --> 05:03.280
He then later on followed up with, sorry, no, we do not keep symbols exported for non-in-kernel

05:03.280 --> 05:04.280
users.

05:04.280 --> 05:07.800
And then another kernel developer chimed in saying that people should go use FreeBSD if

05:07.800 --> 05:08.800
they care about ZFS.

05:08.800 --> 05:11.880
So there was some back and forth, yes.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.960
I think really Greg's annoyance was at the end of the day, like Sun made it impossible

05:15.960 --> 05:17.320
to run it on Linux intentionally.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.040
They were trying to make it hard.

05:19.040 --> 05:25.040
And so his position is, why am I bending over backwards to make a file system work?

05:25.040 --> 05:31.220
Even he says, even if it's the best file system to ever grace this planet, that's fantastic.

05:31.220 --> 05:36.200
But given that the creators of that code placed it under a license that was specifically designed

05:36.200 --> 05:41.120
not to be compatible with Linux, to prevent it from ever being used on Linux, well, you

05:41.120 --> 05:43.440
can see why I really don't care about it.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.440
Why would I?

05:44.440 --> 05:45.440
He writes.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.440
So yeah.

05:46.440 --> 05:47.440
Okay.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.440
I mean, that's, yeah.

05:48.440 --> 05:51.200
Yeah, I think that's a system thing.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.000
Yeah, I suppose so.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.040
But there is a workaround, although it may possibly impact performance.

05:57.040 --> 06:01.440
Well, essentially it just disables the vector instructions that were being used that got

06:01.440 --> 06:02.920
taken away.

06:02.920 --> 06:07.720
And that was to really just make checksumming faster.

06:07.720 --> 06:12.640
So I suppose there's a possibility there'll be some performance hit there, but I'm not

06:12.640 --> 06:13.640
sure.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.640
It's not clear if it's only at build time.

06:14.640 --> 06:18.080
I would not be surprised if we see some benchmarks soon that make it clear.

06:18.080 --> 06:23.000
But at some point, either at the build process or perhaps when doing file system checksums,

06:23.000 --> 06:24.280
there could be a performance hit.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.280
We just don't know yet.

06:25.280 --> 06:28.820
Well, I really hope there isn't a serious performance impact because we will never hear

06:28.820 --> 06:31.260
the end of it from the BSD people.

06:31.260 --> 06:32.260
Can you imagine?

06:32.260 --> 06:34.720
It's based on Linux, but it runs best on FreeBSD.

06:34.720 --> 06:38.400
Well, let's keep talking about the BSDs just for a moment here on the Linux Action News

06:38.400 --> 06:44.480
program and talk about Project Trident, which just had their first stable release.

06:44.480 --> 06:49.680
And for those of you that aren't keeping score at home, Project Trident is based on TrueOS.

06:49.680 --> 06:55.080
And TrueOS itself, at least at the time of this release, was based on FreeBSD 13 Current.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.600
So I managed to install this, but I didn't manage to boot it.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.200
It looks from Twitter that you got on a bit better than I did.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.200
Yeah, I did.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.240
I've used it all morning, actually.

07:03.240 --> 07:07.520
It's funny, I think what I said on Twitter was I went in with kind of low expectations

07:07.520 --> 07:12.160
just because I was expecting it to be a really minimal, cute desktop that wasn't really ready

07:12.160 --> 07:13.160
to go yet.

07:13.160 --> 07:17.820
And this is their first stable release here, and TrueOS is kind of still new, and it's

07:17.820 --> 07:20.160
all still kind of new.

07:20.160 --> 07:24.280
And I went in with low expectations, and I got that sensation that I used to get from

07:24.280 --> 07:28.320
distro hopping when I would move to a new distro that did things really differently

07:28.320 --> 07:30.080
and it really impressed me.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.840
I got that sensation.

07:31.840 --> 07:38.080
And so I think it's very competitive for a particular type of workload.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.480
It may still have some cooking it needs to do, but I was pretty impressed, Joe.

07:41.480 --> 07:46.320
It's funny that it reminded you of a time many years ago because that was exactly the

07:46.320 --> 07:47.320
feeling I got.

07:47.320 --> 07:51.560
I didn't get as far as the desktop, but the whole experience around it felt like when

07:51.560 --> 07:56.800
I first got into Linux, like 10, 11 years ago, from the download speed of the ISO, which

07:56.800 --> 08:01.040
was somewhere around 200 kilobytes a second or whatever, it took hours and hours to download

08:01.040 --> 08:04.280
this four point whatever gigabyte ISO.

08:04.280 --> 08:08.320
And then the installer just felt very clunky and old school to me.

08:08.320 --> 08:12.320
And then the fact that you go through the installation and then just won't boot.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.960
And this is on the laptop that will run Trisco very happily.

08:15.960 --> 08:19.400
It's just Intel, no Nvidia or anything like that.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.600
So I was just not very impressed with it, really.

08:22.600 --> 08:29.220
And I've had a bit of criticism, I think, for being down on BSD generally, or the BSDs.

08:29.220 --> 08:33.320
And I don't think that's fair because things like FreeBSD clearly have a place and they

08:33.320 --> 08:38.040
are excellent at some things, like basically all of the hardware that iX system sells,

08:38.040 --> 08:42.280
for example, and network gear and Nasus and stuff.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.120
It's absolutely perfect for that.

08:44.120 --> 08:49.600
But in terms of the desktop, this Trident really, I think, shows how far behind Linux

08:49.600 --> 08:50.600
they are.

08:50.600 --> 08:54.080
It's really a shame you didn't get to go all the way to the desktop and use it for a bit

08:54.080 --> 09:00.960
because I think some of my notes on here are very much like XFCE.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.960
I think Joe would like this about it.

09:02.960 --> 09:07.960
First of all, it has a Windows 7 sort of workflow look and feel.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.480
And that's the first thing people said on Twitter, oh, I thought that was Windows 7

09:10.480 --> 09:11.480
for a moment.

09:11.480 --> 09:12.480
Yeah.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.480
It's a little old.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.480
It feels a little dated.

09:14.480 --> 09:15.480
That might be fine for a workstation, though.

09:15.480 --> 09:18.080
And it's got a few rough edges.

09:18.080 --> 09:22.020
I've been on a VMware workstation kick, for better or for worse.

09:22.020 --> 09:26.600
And so on my system, all of the bottom buttons of the installer get cut off.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.160
I could just see the very, very, very, very top of the button.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.480
And the first two buttons just shut the thing down to a command line.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.920
It's like, all right, I'll try the other button.

09:35.920 --> 09:36.920
Same exact result.

09:36.920 --> 09:40.320
I had to just sit there and try the different buttons until I got the result I wanted.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.160
So it took me a while to get through the installer.

09:42.160 --> 09:45.540
But once I got it in, a couple of neat things stood out to me.

09:45.540 --> 09:47.780
Number one, their file manager is kind of cool.

09:47.780 --> 09:49.700
It's got built-in Git support.

09:49.700 --> 09:54.560
So you can do Git check-ins and clone repos right in the file manager.

09:54.560 --> 10:00.600
Pretty intelligently, they're using the LTS version of the Qt framework, version 5.12.0.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.600
And the Qt-based desktop itself is very lean.

10:03.600 --> 10:06.760
The Lumina desktop is fast.

10:06.760 --> 10:09.000
It's easily configurable.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.160
There is a control panel-like preferences area that has everything you'd want and not

10:13.160 --> 10:14.160
too much.

10:14.160 --> 10:19.500
And then, and I think maybe this just comes with all true OS-based systems, there's the

10:19.500 --> 10:25.200
true OS sysadmin panel, which reminds me of Yast Lite.

10:25.200 --> 10:31.680
It just does a few things, like manage volume snapshots and boot environments and set up

10:31.680 --> 10:35.760
a few basic essentials about your computer, but that's it.

10:35.760 --> 10:40.120
And last but not least, their update management tool ties in with those boot environments

10:40.120 --> 10:41.960
and ZFS snapshots.

10:41.960 --> 10:45.540
They're using ZFS in really clever ways that you don't even have to configure as an end

10:45.540 --> 10:49.440
user to enable things like software rollbacks.

10:49.440 --> 10:53.400
If your updates don't work, including the entire boot environment, so if the kernel

10:53.400 --> 10:57.440
doesn't work or something gets borked with the boot manager, it can roll it back at a

10:57.440 --> 10:59.340
file system level for you.

10:59.340 --> 11:03.980
And it's just right there in the controls, you know, there's a mishmash of design looks

11:03.980 --> 11:04.980
here and there.

11:04.980 --> 11:09.720
And some things are a little odd, but everything's functional and it's, it performs great.

11:09.720 --> 11:13.000
And I completely forgot that I was on a BSD-based system.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.160
Oh, and it came with Telegram pre-installed.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.160
So I was happy.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.720
Telegram, right there, right there.

11:17.720 --> 11:22.520
Oh, very nice, you're making me want to actually give this another go and try and get it working.

11:22.520 --> 11:26.280
Because I've had a good experience with Ghost BSD before with the Mate desktop, but this

11:26.280 --> 11:29.720
minimal Lumina desktop, I have tried not for a while.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.000
So I would like to give that another go.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.560
So all right, I'll try it on a different machine and see if I can get that to work.

11:34.560 --> 11:36.060
Yeah, I think you might like it.

11:36.060 --> 11:41.720
It's very XFCE in a lot of ways, but in just a very functional kind of way too.

11:41.720 --> 11:47.840
And one other thing that's kind of nice is they have the AppCafe, which is a sort of

11:47.840 --> 11:50.860
Synaptic-like GUI package manager.

11:50.860 --> 11:55.020
And I could install things like Mumble and the Fish Shell in seconds.

11:55.020 --> 11:58.680
Just I typed in Mumble, hit enter, showed up, installed it and downloaded all the Qt

11:58.680 --> 12:02.720
4 dependencies required and everything loaded perfectly fine.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.040
Same with the Fish Shell in seconds.

12:04.040 --> 12:05.600
Are you really selling this to me?

12:05.600 --> 12:10.760
Because Synaptic-like is how I want all my GUI software managers to be.

12:10.760 --> 12:14.680
Yeah, it was peak package management software, I think.

12:14.680 --> 12:17.040
Yeah, exactly, before all the bloat and everything.

12:17.040 --> 12:19.440
All right, I'm definitely gonna have to give this a go then.

12:19.440 --> 12:25.880
Well, if you want something really different, Android x86 has a pretty significant release

12:25.880 --> 12:26.880
this week.

12:26.880 --> 12:34.160
It's 8.1 R1, and there's several things in this that actually make it, I would say, ready

12:34.160 --> 12:35.160
for the desktop.

12:35.160 --> 12:38.560
I know it always kind of has been getting closer and closer, but now there's like things

12:38.560 --> 12:40.760
like a proper taskbar and all that stuff.

12:40.760 --> 12:45.560
Yeah, I've been following the development of this, and this is based on Android 8.1

12:45.560 --> 12:48.920
Oreo, so it is one version behind.

12:48.920 --> 12:53.280
But then most phones are, it's hard Android development.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.860
You can't really criticize them too much for it.

12:56.860 --> 13:01.500
And I've got a touchscreen laptop, a little 11-inch VivoBook, and that's what I always

13:01.500 --> 13:02.500
test this on.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.980
And again, as usual, worked perfectly on there.

13:05.980 --> 13:10.320
And you've got that choice between either a touch-based interface like standard Android

13:10.320 --> 13:16.200
or more of a traditional desktop interface with a taskbar and menu and everything that's

13:16.200 --> 13:17.200
more mouse-based.

13:17.200 --> 13:19.500
And also, worth noting, Joe, freeform window modes.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.680
You can drag windows around.

13:20.680 --> 13:21.680
They're not all full screen, too.

13:21.680 --> 13:23.920
Yeah, so it really is a desktop-like experience.

13:23.920 --> 13:26.840
Why you'd want to do that, I don't know.

13:26.840 --> 13:31.080
It's just something of a curiosity, really, to me.

13:31.080 --> 13:35.360
Surely no one can be actually using this as their daily machine.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.240
Maybe for like a kiosk or appliance.

13:38.240 --> 13:42.280
Maybe it's like in a business where you want people to fill out information when they come

13:42.280 --> 13:43.280
in.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.280
I don't know.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.560
I'm just trying to think how I use this.

13:45.560 --> 13:46.560
I like it.

13:46.560 --> 13:47.800
I like messing around with it.

13:47.800 --> 13:51.360
I use it for about a good solid couple of hours every release.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.880
And I'm like, OK, good enough.

13:53.880 --> 13:56.200
But I actually couldn't get this one to boot.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.200
Maybe it's VMware Workstation.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.120
I was trying everything out in VMware Workstation.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.720
So maybe that's the issue.

14:00.720 --> 14:01.920
So I didn't actually get to try it.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.520
Did you get it to boot and try it?

14:03.520 --> 14:06.320
Yeah, yeah, I booted it on hardware on this VivoBook, yeah.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.440
Surely with all the laptops you've got lying around, I suppose you're on the road at the

14:09.440 --> 14:10.440
moment.

14:10.440 --> 14:11.440
Yeah, that's the thing.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.440
I'm on the road.

14:12.440 --> 14:13.440
So I got limited hardware.

14:13.440 --> 14:14.440
So I was trying virtualization.

14:14.440 --> 14:15.440
Yeah.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.440
I don't know.

14:16.440 --> 14:20.920
I'm somewhat tempted to put this on the VivoBook because I don't really have that much use

14:20.920 --> 14:23.840
for that machine anymore because I recently bought a new laptop.

14:23.840 --> 14:26.160
And so it's kind of a bit redundant.

14:26.160 --> 14:32.560
And it would be nice, I suppose, to have essentially a large tablet with a keyboard.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.280
So maybe I'll give it a go.

14:34.280 --> 14:38.360
Yeah, I could see it on an x86-based tablet.

14:38.360 --> 14:43.400
And maybe it's one of the several OSs I have on there, especially if you can have a GApps

14:43.400 --> 14:44.400
equivalent.

14:44.400 --> 14:49.320
And now I can get the Netflix app, and I can download videos for offline watching.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.120
Now I'm starting to see a use case here.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.400
But it's pretty backwoods.

14:52.400 --> 14:56.180
I don't really know how many users are interested.

14:56.180 --> 14:57.180
Maybe it's software development.

14:57.180 --> 14:58.180
Maybe that's what it is.

14:58.180 --> 14:59.180
Maybe it's for developers, Joe.

14:59.180 --> 15:02.840
Maybe it's for people to develop Android software on big, fast computers.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.400
Maybe in testing and things.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.320
It does have the Play Store pre-installed.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.640
So you can get things like Netflix.

15:08.640 --> 15:11.200
I didn't actually try Netflix, but I assume you can get that.

15:11.200 --> 15:14.160
You can certainly get most of the apps that I looked for.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.440
I'd be surprised if it works.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.360
There's probably some DRM thing in there that kicks in.

15:17.360 --> 15:18.360
Yeah.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.360
I'm going to have to try that then.

15:19.360 --> 15:23.200
I kind of like talking about the other end of these releases, though, like post-market

15:23.200 --> 15:24.200
OS.

15:24.200 --> 15:31.480
Yeah, which is, as the name suggests, an aftermarket firmware for primarily phones, but some boards.

15:31.480 --> 15:35.640
And the idea of it is that you'll get 10 years of support with it.

15:35.640 --> 15:38.080
And it's not going to be based on Android.

15:38.080 --> 15:44.260
It's going to be aiming for at least mainline kernels and very long-term support for devices

15:44.260 --> 15:47.920
that otherwise have been completely abandoned by the original OEM.

15:47.920 --> 15:48.920
Yeah.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.920
And it looks like most of the user space Linux stuff is Alpine Linux right now.

15:51.920 --> 15:55.840
In fact, one of the things they're working on is they've been based on the development

15:55.840 --> 15:59.480
branch of Alpine Linux, which was good while they're developing software.

15:59.480 --> 16:04.380
But I meant about once a month, everything would break in post-market OS.

16:04.380 --> 16:09.940
And they have been spending a lot of time just integrating Alpine Linux updates without

16:09.940 --> 16:13.540
really iterating on the operating system itself.

16:13.540 --> 16:19.240
So to avoid substantial breakage, as they put it, they are rebasing on the Alpine stable

16:19.240 --> 16:21.120
releases in the future.

16:21.120 --> 16:26.840
And then they will have a package branch, which is based on the next Alpine release,

16:26.840 --> 16:28.600
which is every six months or so.

16:28.600 --> 16:32.120
Essentially, they're just going to match Alpine's release cadence.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.640
But it's still very early days for this.

16:34.640 --> 16:39.560
It's nowhere near something like Ubuntu Touch, for example, in terms of actual usability.

16:39.560 --> 16:40.560
Yeah.

16:40.560 --> 16:45.080
So for example, like the Nexus 5, they have a booting mainline kernel.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.280
They've got accelerated graphics.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.320
That's huge.

16:47.320 --> 16:51.020
And they can actually communicate with the cellular modem.

16:51.020 --> 16:52.920
But there's no working audio.

16:52.920 --> 16:53.920
There's no calls happening.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.960
I mean, it's really early days.

16:55.960 --> 17:00.240
And there's hundreds of devices that they currently support at various levels like that.

17:00.240 --> 17:04.760
In this update, they're adding a bunch of other devices, including some cool tablet

17:04.760 --> 17:06.980
devices and some other ARM-based devices.

17:06.980 --> 17:10.360
But it's all various levels of support.

17:10.360 --> 17:15.320
And they're trying to get some basic goalposts in there, like get cell calls working and

17:15.320 --> 17:16.320
things like that.

17:16.320 --> 17:18.400
But so far, they haven't gotten there.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.240
I do like their honest approach, though.

17:20.240 --> 17:26.200
If you go to postmarketos.org, right there, the first thing you see is alpha version,

17:26.200 --> 17:29.300
calls don't work, et cetera, only suitable for hackers.

17:29.300 --> 17:33.560
So they're not trying to make any claims beyond that, which is good.

17:33.560 --> 17:39.880
But it does show how hard this is to make a proper Linux system work on ARM.

17:39.880 --> 17:40.880
Right.

17:40.880 --> 17:44.040
But flip this around for a moment, Joe, on its head, and look at the Nexus 5.

17:44.040 --> 17:47.760
That's been completely abandoned by the original creator.

17:47.760 --> 17:51.480
There's zero support now from Google for the Nexus 5.

17:51.480 --> 17:54.560
At least Post Market OS supports it to some degree.

17:54.560 --> 17:59.120
So you could make the argument that they're supporting it better than the original creator.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.780
The thing is with projects like this, too, is they have time.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.800
They have time to work this out.

18:03.800 --> 18:07.960
There's not a huge commercial product that they have to get to market and they don't

18:07.960 --> 18:11.000
have to sell millions of copies of to be sustainable.

18:11.000 --> 18:16.440
It really is an open source project that can take its time to build something and eventually

18:16.440 --> 18:18.680
become something that can keep these devices going.

18:18.680 --> 18:22.600
And if they only get to maybe, say, a dozen or so that are fully supported, well, then

18:22.600 --> 18:24.120
they're better off than they would have been.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.120
Yeah, that's true.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.600
And you mentioned the Nexus 5 there.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.840
Of course, you can run lineage on that.

18:28.840 --> 18:33.080
But all the kernel and drivers and everything are seriously out of date and a potential

18:33.080 --> 18:39.400
security risk, whereas the whole point of Post Market OS is to be up to date and secure.

18:39.400 --> 18:44.080
And I suppose that is a good priority to have if you use that as a foundation.

18:44.080 --> 18:48.200
And then once they get it up to a point where it is working really well with an interface

18:48.200 --> 18:52.160
like Plasma Mobile, for example, then you'll have something that's actually really worth

18:52.160 --> 18:53.560
using in the long term.

18:53.560 --> 18:59.080
Did you see in this update, they also talk about getting XFCE 4 running on the Librem

18:59.080 --> 19:00.360
5 dev kit board?

19:00.360 --> 19:05.680
Yeah, I did see that and it warmed my heart to see XFCE running there, although in the

19:05.680 --> 19:09.800
photo that's in this post, you have to scroll down a little way to see it.

19:09.800 --> 19:14.160
If you expand that photo, you see something quite alarming, and that is a fan attached

19:14.160 --> 19:16.200
to this Librem 5 dev kit.

19:16.200 --> 19:19.480
Whoa, holy rotations, Batman.

19:19.480 --> 19:23.360
That is that it looks also like it's been wired on there.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.720
Perhaps they wired it.

19:24.720 --> 19:25.720
Maybe they had to overclock it.

19:25.720 --> 19:32.240
Let's give the benefit of the doubt here because this first of all, this dev board is large.

19:32.240 --> 19:35.920
It's like four or five raspberry pies next to each other large.

19:35.920 --> 19:36.920
It's big.

19:36.920 --> 19:41.520
And there is a, what would you call that, a 40 millimeter fan.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.000
It's a pretty small fan, might even be 20.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.360
It's one of those real high pitched whiners.

19:47.360 --> 19:53.640
And it has been suspended with stiff wire over the CPU heat sink in what appears to

19:53.640 --> 19:58.400
be a desperate attempt to cool the CPU on the dev board.

19:58.400 --> 20:02.480
You know, Joe, though, I got to say, looking at the screenshot here, they have the info

20:02.480 --> 20:06.600
up on the screen and the CPU is running at 1.5 gigahertz, which double checked me, but

20:06.600 --> 20:09.880
I think that's the clock speed it's supposed to be running at.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.160
Yeah, I think that is stock.

20:11.160 --> 20:12.360
So yeah, it's not even overclocked.

20:12.360 --> 20:14.020
That is very alarming then.

20:14.020 --> 20:18.760
Could it be that PureOS will be more efficient somehow?

20:18.760 --> 20:23.080
And maybe that's something that I don't know post market need to work on.

20:23.080 --> 20:28.400
I would say this, if you want to know what we're talking about, go to linuxactionnews.com

20:28.400 --> 20:33.440
slash 89 and then go to the post market OS link, scroll down this post and look at this

20:33.440 --> 20:37.560
photo of the XFCE desktop and then let us know what you think.

20:37.560 --> 20:41.680
Linuxactionnews.com slash contact, legitimately, if I didn't know any better, I'd say this

20:41.680 --> 20:45.960
is a really bad sign, but you know, this could be anything.

20:45.960 --> 20:46.960
It could be anything.

20:46.960 --> 20:49.960
So we'd love to have somebody talk us off the cliff.

20:49.960 --> 20:55.360
Yeah, well, I'm hoping to speak to Todd at some point soon, the CEO of Todd Weaver of

20:55.360 --> 21:00.080
PureOSM because we agreed a hot date on Valentine's Day.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.080
It's true.

21:01.080 --> 21:02.080
That's true.

21:02.080 --> 21:05.020
Oh, by the way, just one more thing on the post market OS.

21:05.020 --> 21:10.960
They also got Unity 8 working on top of post market, which is just, I don't know.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.320
They say it runs great.

21:13.320 --> 21:14.560
I'm sure it does.

21:14.560 --> 21:20.800
It's a pretty neat project and I love the idea of it's Alpine based.

21:20.800 --> 21:25.080
It's not necessarily like some clone of Android that they're trying to flash onto these phones,

21:25.080 --> 21:27.040
which may actually be a lot easier.

21:27.040 --> 21:32.260
It is its own unique thing that they're trying to breathe 10 years of life into a device

21:32.260 --> 21:35.720
after it's been abandoned by a manufacturer.

21:35.720 --> 21:40.920
And if they can even get that for a handful of devices, I think it's going to be a project

21:40.920 --> 21:41.920
that is cherished.

21:41.920 --> 21:47.880
Well, a project that was cherished by some people was the Firefox test pilot program,

21:47.880 --> 21:50.960
which Mozilla have decided is no more.

21:50.960 --> 21:55.780
I read this post, Joe, and I feel like if you're a student going into business communications,

21:55.780 --> 22:02.360
you should go read this because it is a masterpiece in reframing failure as an epic success.

22:02.360 --> 22:06.480
I'll give you a couple of quick choice quotes here because keep in mind, test pilot was

22:06.480 --> 22:11.760
starting to get a bad name for a lot of, well, most people consider it an advertising mechanism,

22:11.760 --> 22:13.320
fair or not.

22:13.320 --> 22:16.440
And so it was time to get to get far, far away from it.

22:16.440 --> 22:17.440
But this is how it's framed.

22:17.440 --> 22:22.640
They say, we're proud to announce today that we're evolving our approach to experimentation

22:22.640 --> 22:24.480
even further.

22:24.480 --> 22:30.720
Test pilot was designed to harness the energy of our most passionate users.

22:30.720 --> 22:34.120
Test pilot performed better than we could have ever imagined.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.680
As a result of this program, we're now in a stronger position.

22:37.680 --> 22:42.900
So today, we are announcing that we will be moving to a new structure that will demonstrate

22:42.900 --> 22:45.840
our ability to innovate in exciting ways.

22:45.840 --> 22:51.040
As a result, we're closing the test pilot program as we've known it.

22:51.040 --> 22:55.880
Because it's such a success, Joe, it's been so incredibly blow the doors off successful,

22:55.880 --> 22:56.880
we're ending it.

22:56.880 --> 23:00.680
Well, to be fair, they do say now that everyone is responsible for maintaining the culture

23:00.680 --> 23:05.800
of experimentation capitalized, Firefox has developed through this process.

23:05.800 --> 23:09.520
So they're basically saying that instead of just having this small test pilot program,

23:09.520 --> 23:13.640
now all the experiments will be part of Firefox.

23:13.640 --> 23:14.640
Yeah.

23:14.640 --> 23:19.640
And it sounds like it's actually a realignment inside Mozilla too, because here's the wording

23:19.640 --> 23:20.640
you're going off.

23:20.640 --> 23:25.360
You say, migrating to a new model doesn't mean we're doing fewer experiments.

23:25.360 --> 23:29.440
In fact, we're doing even more with an exclamation mark.

23:29.440 --> 23:36.440
The innovation process that led to products like Firefox Monitor are no longer the responsibility

23:36.440 --> 23:42.840
of a handful of individuals, but rather the entire organization.

23:42.840 --> 23:47.680
So read that as there was just a team that was responsible for test pilot and tried a

23:47.680 --> 23:53.400
few things, and now we're just making that a company wide thing or a group wide thing.

23:53.400 --> 23:58.400
So you're right, it's not only going to be a change in how Firefox delivers these features,

23:58.400 --> 24:02.200
but it's going to be a structural change inside the Mozilla group too.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.640
It just seems like a bad idea to me.

24:04.640 --> 24:09.480
It was a great idea before that you could opt in to this program where you get these

24:09.480 --> 24:14.360
new features, and you could test them out and help out the project with it.

24:14.360 --> 24:20.360
They weren't inflicting these potentially bad features onto the entire user base.

24:20.360 --> 24:24.640
And okay, they can do it with sort of staged rollouts and stuff, but it just seemed like

24:24.640 --> 24:26.560
that was a great idea before.

24:26.560 --> 24:31.460
And to get rid of it and move to a culture of experimentation just doesn't seem right

24:31.460 --> 24:32.460
to me.

24:32.460 --> 24:33.460
Yeah.

24:33.460 --> 24:35.240
I mean, I got to assume they're going to do some sort of staged rollout.

24:35.240 --> 24:39.800
They don't outline that in here, but I think it's safe to say the test pilot program caught

24:39.800 --> 24:43.000
a few bad ideas before they rolled out to everybody.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
And that's valuable.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.760
I hope they do something like that.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.940
It would be wise to do that, and I would imagine they're going to.

24:48.940 --> 24:49.940
But you're right.

24:49.940 --> 24:55.040
To me, it seems like it's extremely precarious times for Firefox with the changes coming

24:55.040 --> 25:03.720
to Microsoft Edge and the total dominance that WebKit and Blink now seem to be approaching.

25:03.720 --> 25:11.720
Firefox is in a bad position, and all of this, from the way they communicate it to the things

25:11.720 --> 25:16.000
that they do, they're not making a compelling case.

25:16.000 --> 25:21.200
And there's so many basics that they still get wrong on the different operating systems

25:21.200 --> 25:25.400
on Windows, on Linux, and on Mac OS.

25:25.400 --> 25:31.440
They failed to fully integrate with those host operating systems in a way that it makes

25:31.440 --> 25:35.000
Firefox often the third browser for a lot of people.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.900
And that's a really bad position.

25:36.900 --> 25:40.800
I think they're really screwed because the way they communicate is so screwed.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.720
It doesn't connect with any of us anymore.

25:43.720 --> 25:46.240
They've completely lost us in the message.

25:46.240 --> 25:53.240
And their priorities are so big, and their goals are so lofty, and their market share

25:53.240 --> 25:56.960
is so small, and it just seems to be getting smaller.

25:56.960 --> 26:02.340
I feel like it is essentially end of days for Firefox, unless people actively start

26:02.340 --> 26:05.160
making a choice to run this browser.

26:05.160 --> 26:10.480
I'm using it right now to do this show, but I can't make a difference alone.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.800
And a handful of Linux users aren't going to make a difference either.

26:12.800 --> 26:16.320
It has to be on the commercial platforms, and that's just not happening.

26:16.320 --> 26:21.040
Man, you paint a very bleak picture for someone who's sitting here staring at Firefox right

26:21.040 --> 26:22.040
now.

26:22.040 --> 26:26.520
I really hope that they can turn it around, because I'd like it as a browser.

26:26.520 --> 26:31.400
I prefer to use a completely open source, free software browser.

26:31.400 --> 26:37.140
And I don't want to have to use Chrome, or even Chromium, really.

26:37.140 --> 26:42.000
I've used Firefox for years and years and years, and I just want to keep using it.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
So I really hope you're wrong.

26:43.000 --> 26:47.800
I do too, because, in fact, I hope I'm really wrong, because it's not just they need to

26:47.800 --> 26:48.800
survive.

26:48.800 --> 26:54.720
They need to have a measurable, important percentage of the market, so that way they

26:54.720 --> 26:56.360
have a real seat at the table.

26:56.360 --> 27:00.320
They have power and leverage in the conversation about web standards.

27:00.320 --> 27:03.500
And they don't have that if they don't have a sizable market share.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.440
So it's not just like they have to be surviving.

27:05.440 --> 27:08.840
They have to be thriving to really be successful.

27:08.840 --> 27:15.260
I think maybe I'm losing faith in the side of Mozilla that doesn't necessarily have its

27:15.260 --> 27:16.840
hands on the code as much.

27:16.840 --> 27:17.840
I don't know.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.580
You just look at all the stories we've covered.

27:19.580 --> 27:21.060
But hopefully I'm wrong.

27:21.060 --> 27:22.060
Time will tell, Joe.

27:22.060 --> 27:27.200
Well, at least they're killing Adobe Flash support in the upcoming Firefox 69.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.640
It's funny that you have to say Adobe Flash now.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.360
That's how irrelevant it is.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.920
You have to kind of specify which Flash you're talking about.

27:33.920 --> 27:34.920
I guess so.

27:34.920 --> 27:40.940
I mean, it feels like this has been a slow-moving development.

27:40.940 --> 27:45.560
But the announcement from Adobe itself was back in 2017 that it planned to push Flash

27:45.560 --> 27:47.540
into an end-of-life state.

27:47.540 --> 27:54.040
So there's sort of been this 2017 announcement with a 2020 roadmap objective for Adobe.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.680
And so this is actually right in step with that.

27:55.680 --> 27:58.000
In fact, they're even coming in a little early.

27:58.000 --> 28:02.040
Firefox 69 is scheduled to be released on September 9th.

28:02.040 --> 28:06.240
So if you are in a corporation using Firefox where Flash is still relevant, I know that's

28:06.240 --> 28:09.040
also in education.

28:09.040 --> 28:14.240
For example, my kids' schools, Firefox on the machines, and they're using Flash apps.

28:14.240 --> 28:15.240
Flash apps, Joe.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.960
So they're going to have to brace themselves for this change.

28:17.960 --> 28:21.280
And it'll be on September 9th that Firefox 69 ships on time.

28:21.280 --> 28:23.020
Well, it's not just with Firefox.

28:23.020 --> 28:24.400
It's happening with Chrome as well.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.520
Flash is just on its way out.

28:26.520 --> 28:30.480
So institutions like your kids' school that are using Flash, this is just going to force

28:30.480 --> 28:31.480
their hand.

28:31.480 --> 28:34.520
It's going to have to go another route, and it's going to end up costing a lot of money

28:34.520 --> 28:39.440
probably to develop these apps and games and educational games and stuff.

28:39.440 --> 28:41.040
So is the world, though, of software, Joe.

28:41.040 --> 28:44.040
In fact, it's a reason why schools should be using open-source software.

28:44.040 --> 28:45.040
Let's be honest.

28:45.040 --> 28:48.480
This is where free software is extremely strong, especially in the education sector.

28:48.480 --> 28:51.560
And I'll note it's not just Flash, a lot of great plugins.

28:51.560 --> 28:55.840
The whole Netscape API for plugins is being deprecated.

28:55.840 --> 28:56.880
And it's just time to go.

28:56.880 --> 28:57.880
It's old.

28:57.880 --> 28:58.880
It's insecure.

28:58.880 --> 29:03.760
And this has been a massive transition for Firefox to make.

29:03.760 --> 29:10.720
And in the day and age of HTML5 and everything we've got now with web apps and WebAssembly,

29:10.720 --> 29:11.720
there's no excuse.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.120
Just switch to something else.

29:13.120 --> 29:16.680
And if you're going to switch, a little bit of Linux Action News advice, switch to free

29:16.680 --> 29:17.680
software.

29:17.680 --> 29:18.680
Here's a tagline, Joe.

29:18.680 --> 29:19.680
This is from Linux Action News.

29:19.680 --> 29:20.680
Everybody out there can take it.

29:20.680 --> 29:21.800
It's all free to the community.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.560
The tagline is this.

29:23.560 --> 29:27.240
You migrate to free software, and you only have to migrate once.

29:27.240 --> 29:28.240
Boom.

29:28.240 --> 29:29.240
The sales write themselves.

29:29.240 --> 29:30.240
Yeah.

29:30.240 --> 29:31.240
Let's stick it on a t-shirt.

29:31.240 --> 29:34.240
I like that idea.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.880
You should do that real quick, Joe, before we publish this.

29:35.880 --> 29:38.480
Or if somebody out there does that, just give us a cut.

29:38.480 --> 29:42.560
In the meantime, if you've been listening for quite a while, you know the drill.
