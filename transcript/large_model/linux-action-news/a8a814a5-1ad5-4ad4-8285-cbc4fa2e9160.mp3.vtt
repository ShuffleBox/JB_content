00:00.000 --> 00:09.140
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 197, recorded on July 11th, 2021.

00:09.140 --> 00:10.140
I'm Chris.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.140
And I'm Wes.

00:11.140 --> 00:12.140
Hello, Wes.

00:12.140 --> 00:13.140
Let's do the news.

00:13.140 --> 00:17.940
During a virtual presentation streamed to the public, the Nextcloud team announced Nextcloud

00:17.940 --> 00:22.780
Hub 22, the second major launch this year.

00:22.780 --> 00:28.140
During the presentation, CEO and founder Frank Karliczek made the case that Nextcloud solves

00:28.140 --> 00:33.200
complicated cloud privacy and legal issues in an ideal way.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.080
But this is exactly what we want to solve with Nextcloud.

00:36.080 --> 00:40.320
So Nextcloud is the only solution that provides you with all these collaboration communication

00:40.320 --> 00:45.560
features that we need, like in our world, as it is today, and it will be in the future

00:45.560 --> 00:47.480
after the pandemic.

00:47.480 --> 00:55.200
But we provide the security, we make everything GDPR compliant, there is no vendor login,

00:55.200 --> 00:58.120
we don't sell any data to advertisers, obviously.

00:58.120 --> 01:03.720
So in our opinion, Nextcloud is actually the solution for this post-pandemic world, but

01:03.720 --> 01:07.700
in a good way, respecting privacy and security of the users.

01:07.700 --> 01:12.600
And of course, the stream focused on the release of Hub 22 and its many new features.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.040
Circles is one of the features that caught our attention.

01:15.040 --> 01:19.540
If you live in the Nextcloud ecosystem, they enable powerful tools to help curate the information

01:19.540 --> 01:24.620
you see coming in and define for the users who they can work with, because they are user

01:24.620 --> 01:28.880
defined groups that make it easier to manage those teams and make it simpler to define

01:28.880 --> 01:33.520
who you can share files with or assign tasks to, and of course, create chat rooms with.

01:33.520 --> 01:39.420
Hub 22 makes the integrated chat and task workflows even more helpful, letting you easily

01:39.420 --> 01:45.560
share project decks into a chat room or quickly turn a chat message into a task.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.600
They're also integrating with several document signature backends, making it easy to sign

01:49.600 --> 01:52.400
documents right inside Nextcloud.

01:52.400 --> 01:56.120
That does sound nice, and indeed, there are also some improvements that landed for Nextcloud

01:56.120 --> 02:00.840
Mail, features like improved threading, email tagging, and support for C filtering.

02:00.840 --> 02:05.040
There's also Collectives, which looks like something I'd like to play more with.

02:05.040 --> 02:09.800
You can kind of think of Collectives as a knowledge base with management tools built

02:09.800 --> 02:11.280
into Nextcloud.

02:11.280 --> 02:15.960
Collectives has full-text search, document embedding, and access to knowledge is managed

02:15.960 --> 02:19.720
with user defined groups through Circles, tying it all together.

02:19.720 --> 02:23.320
I'm seeing Circles everywhere in this release, Wes. More and more though, I think what Nextcloud

02:23.320 --> 02:29.120
is doing here is really building organizational glue, and they're building a compelling group

02:29.120 --> 02:32.960
of collaboration tools that give you an environment where it all connects together.

02:32.960 --> 02:38.840
A company like Jupyter Broadcasting that really hasn't sunk super deep into some Office 365

02:38.840 --> 02:42.920
or super deep into Google Apps, I kind of find this appealing because we need a little

02:42.920 --> 02:47.760
bit of project management. We need a chat interface. It could replace several tools.

02:47.760 --> 02:52.260
It's taken a lot of releases for these collaboration tools to kind of all come together as they

02:52.260 --> 02:58.280
have now in Hub 22. But in listening to their stream and looking at the features of this

02:58.280 --> 03:02.640
release, it seems to me that the work from home move last year seems to have given the

03:02.640 --> 03:05.360
Nextcloud team a whole new set of momentum.

03:05.360 --> 03:11.120
Well, from creating things to destroying things, a lot happened this week in the open source

03:11.120 --> 03:16.200
world. We told you we would keep an eye on the Audacity fork situation, and this week

03:16.200 --> 03:20.840
it appears the fork hype slowed its roll a bit when the maintainer of one of the more

03:20.840 --> 03:26.080
popular forks stepped down over claims of physical harassment.

03:26.080 --> 03:30.880
The trouble began when the quintessential free software audio editor changed ownership

03:30.880 --> 03:37.600
hands back in May. Days after that oddly handled acquisition announcement, the company proposed

03:37.600 --> 03:44.840
telemetry be added to the project and announced the enforcement of a contributor license agreement.

03:44.840 --> 03:49.960
While the company seemed to listen and respond to feedback, many were still shocked by the

03:49.960 --> 03:56.700
initial overreaches. Then came changes to the privacy agreement, which excluded users

03:56.700 --> 04:03.920
under the age of 13, a perhaps questionable move possibly even running afoul of the GPL.

04:03.920 --> 04:08.000
And the response to all of these moves were entirely predictable. The project was forked

04:08.000 --> 04:12.680
multiple times since these announcements. Audacity's Flatpak maintainer quickly jumped

04:12.680 --> 04:17.000
into action and blocked the Flatpak version's network access. Even though the telemetry

04:17.000 --> 04:21.480
hadn't even been added to Audacity yet, at least in the shipping version, the Flatpak

04:21.480 --> 04:25.160
maintainer wanted to ensure that users were going to be protected, so he just shut it

04:25.160 --> 04:30.920
off. And since the latest round of, well, frankly easily preventable public blunders

04:30.920 --> 04:36.360
by the Muse group, the Audacity project has been forked more than 50 times, including

04:36.360 --> 04:38.400
the Tenacity project.

04:38.400 --> 04:43.600
Accused by the GitHub user known as Cookie Engineer, it's this fork that attracted the

04:43.600 --> 04:50.200
attention of 4chan, resulting in what Cookie Engineer claims is real-world harassment and

04:50.200 --> 04:52.600
thus his abandoning of the project.

04:52.600 --> 04:58.000
Yeah, okay, so the whole thing, what started all this alleged harassment, was a disagreement

04:58.000 --> 05:04.280
over the new project's name. Yep. So of course they couldn't use Audacity, right? That's

05:04.280 --> 05:09.080
owned by the Muse group now, so Cookie Engineer ran a poll to find a new name. Well, 4chan

05:09.080 --> 05:13.520
caught wind of this poll and thought it would be hilarious to ensure that Sneedacity, a

05:13.520 --> 05:16.640
reference to the Simpsons, won that poll.

05:16.640 --> 05:22.760
Then when Cookie Engineer deleted the poll and picked Tenacity as the new name, well,

05:22.760 --> 05:28.080
that didn't go over well. The initial response from 4chan members, though, seemed rather

05:28.080 --> 05:33.280
reasonable, actually. They just forked the Audacity project themselves and named it Sneedacity.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.280
All right.

05:34.280 --> 05:38.920
Yeah, but things didn't stay there, Wes. Things could not just be left alone. The two forks

05:38.920 --> 05:44.360
could not live on in their own in peace. Now there is no way for Wes and I to verify these

05:44.360 --> 05:48.080
claims, but still, Cookie Engineer claims that 4chan members took things considerably

05:48.080 --> 05:53.000
further by including physical harassment with a butterfly knife, which, if true, would be

05:53.000 --> 05:57.080
considered an illegal weapon in Germany. And after that incident, the developer took to

05:57.080 --> 06:00.480
GitHub and announced that he was stepping down from the project.

06:00.480 --> 06:05.640
While a search of the forum shows no evidence of Cookie Engineer's address being shared,

06:05.640 --> 06:10.520
nor calls for physical violence, there were several calls for action to see him banned

06:10.520 --> 06:16.720
from GitHub. Also of note, the 4chaner responsible for creating Sneedacity seems to have been

06:16.720 --> 06:19.440
targeted as well.

06:19.440 --> 06:25.520
As for the Tenacity project, it will likely appoint a new maintainer should anyone still

06:25.520 --> 06:26.520
want the job.

06:26.520 --> 06:31.840
Yeah, it's a hard job in multiple, multiple ways. So things are going to take a little

06:31.840 --> 06:35.120
while to shake out. And if you're looking for an alternative to Audacity right now,

06:35.120 --> 06:39.960
well, then I recommend you check out Osen Audio for a fantastic single track audio editor,

06:39.960 --> 06:44.120
a real gem out there. And then, of course, there is our favorite audio editor of all

06:44.120 --> 06:48.840
time, and that's Reaper, which works great on Linux. And they even make a version that

06:48.840 --> 06:50.760
would run on the Raspberry Pi.

06:50.760 --> 06:56.440
And of course, an honorable mention for the Ardour project, a feature rich and open source

06:56.440 --> 06:58.960
digital audio workstation.

06:58.960 --> 07:02.840
Another entirely predictable story, but one we've all been dreading, is this week the

07:02.840 --> 07:08.000
news broke, depending on how you measure it, that Microsoft Edge has beat Firefox to become

07:08.000 --> 07:12.800
the third most popular browser in the world. In recent months, the pair have been neck

07:12.800 --> 07:18.840
and neck, but Microsoft's browser has now pulled ahead in what seems to be a clear lead.

07:18.840 --> 07:25.680
Figures for June suggest Microsoft Edge now holds 3.4% of the browser market, while Firefox

07:25.680 --> 07:32.360
has slipped to 3.29, continuing a downward trajectory that has seen the browser either

07:32.360 --> 07:41.240
lose or just maintain market share in 10 out of the last 12 months. The trend, unfortunately,

07:41.240 --> 07:43.760
seems clear.

07:43.760 --> 07:48.800
This recent change pushes Edge into the third position in the browser rankings, behind only

07:48.800 --> 07:56.560
Chrome at a lofty 65% and then Safari at 18%. Things have definitely been picking up momentum

07:56.560 --> 08:00.720
for Edge since last summer, the browser's market share has more than tripled. Now marketing

08:00.720 --> 08:04.720
obviously plays some role in the increased adoption, and that's the angle that Microsoft

08:04.720 --> 08:09.920
is really going to lean into for this story. But I can't help but just notice that it was

08:09.920 --> 08:15.400
last month that Microsoft began rolling out Edge to all Windows PCs via Windows Update.

08:15.400 --> 08:20.880
That had to expand the install base likely by millions almost overnight, which I think

08:20.880 --> 08:24.680
is why you are now seeing Edge push ahead in the numbers this month.

08:24.680 --> 08:29.240
Now you've definitely got it on your machine, and beyond that, Microsoft is doing everything

08:29.240 --> 08:35.140
in its power to encourage users to actually abandon the old Internet Explorer in favor

08:35.140 --> 08:41.960
of this new Edge, going so far as removing support for Microsoft 365 web apps and automatically

08:41.960 --> 08:48.080
launching certain pages in the new browser. And of course, Safari is the default browser

08:48.080 --> 08:53.160
on iOS, which is clearly pretty hard to compete against.

08:53.160 --> 08:58.400
One can't help but feel like it was kind of naturally just going to shake out like this.

08:58.400 --> 09:03.320
When these big platform owners are exerting the leverage of their big platforms to drive

09:03.320 --> 09:09.120
user adoption to their browsers, how could an independent browser like Firefox even hope

09:09.120 --> 09:24.920
to compete?

09:24.920 --> 09:30.480
Linode.com slash LAN. Linode started in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing,

09:30.480 --> 09:35.880
three years before AWS and other enterprise providers. And when you go to Linode.com slash

09:35.880 --> 09:41.000
LAN, you can get $100 in credit for 60 days on a new account.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.420
Linode's independently owned and they founded on a love for Linux and open source technologies.

09:45.420 --> 09:50.340
They also love the community that surrounds Linux. Linode is making our Jupiter Colony

09:50.340 --> 09:55.640
reunion road trip possible, with meetups in Salt Lake City and Denver and more along the

09:55.640 --> 10:01.320
way, all powered by Linode. Everything we've built since Jupiter broadcasting went independent

10:01.320 --> 10:07.040
is hosted on Linode. And if we ever run into any troubles or if you ever run into any troubles,

10:07.040 --> 10:12.960
Linode comes with amazing 24 seven customer support by phone or ticket, along with hundreds

10:12.960 --> 10:18.280
of guides and tutorials to help you get started on your projects. Linode is part of our team

10:18.280 --> 10:22.520
now. Behind the scenes, they're what makes what we do possible. If it weren't for these

10:22.520 --> 10:27.320
very advertisements right here, you'd never know because Linode just runs smooth. It's

10:27.320 --> 10:31.600
nice and buttery smooth, you might say. It's just fast. It's reliable. And the experience

10:31.600 --> 10:35.400
is great. The dashboard is sharp and easy to use. And they have everything you might

10:35.400 --> 10:39.840
want to get started quick if that's your preference. And they have S3 compatible object storage,

10:39.840 --> 10:44.800

Linux.ting.com. If you're sick of overpaying for your sales service, go see how much you

11:37.240 --> 11:43.560
could save and then get $25 off at linux.ting.com. Ting can help you save money because they're

11:43.560 --> 11:48.680
an MBNO or a mobile virtual network operator. That means Ting mobile customers get the same

11:48.680 --> 11:54.640
access as customers of the big guys, but with better customer service at a much lower cost.

11:54.640 --> 11:58.320
With Ting mobile, you get the same coast to coast coverage you might with say, the big

11:58.320 --> 12:02.400
networks you're familiar with, but you just pay less. And Ting's plans are simple and

12:02.400 --> 12:06.660
straightforward, like their new set 12 plan, which gives you 12 gigabytes of data with

12:06.660 --> 12:13.480
unlimited talk and text for $35 a month. And you know a good family plan is hard to find.

12:13.480 --> 12:17.000
Now they have plans that address this. You add as many lines as you like. It's just 10

12:17.000 --> 12:22.480
bucks a line and every line has unlimited text and calls. How trouble free is that?

12:22.480 --> 12:26.200
And then you share a pool of data and it doesn't really matter how much you want. You can pick

12:26.200 --> 12:30.520
the right plan for you that works. Two, 20, a lot more. There's going to be something

12:30.520 --> 12:36.320
that matches up with you. And every Ting plan comes with their award winning customer service

12:36.320 --> 12:43.280
with nationwide LT and 5g coverage and the freedom of no contract ever. It's simple to

12:43.280 --> 12:47.160
switch to Ting. Pretty much any phone will work with Ting because of that network support.

12:47.160 --> 12:51.600
So just head over to linux.ting.com. Check your current phone out, create an account,

12:51.600 --> 12:55.920
pick the plan that's right for you. And then Ting will send you a SIM card. You pop that

12:55.920 --> 13:00.700
in your phone and you get activated in minutes. Cutting your phone bill in half has never

13:00.700 --> 13:05.920
been easier with Ting's great new plans. It's the next generation of Ting mobile. It's here.

13:05.920 --> 13:13.080
Go see how much you could save and then take $25 off. Linux.ting.com. Thanks to Ting for

13:13.080 --> 13:16.840
supporting Linux Action News. And thanks to everybody who makes it possible for us to

13:16.840 --> 13:23.880
give these shows away for free by visiting linux.ting.com.

13:23.880 --> 13:30.760
And now for a few stories from our kernel corner. Starting with Fedora's kernel 5.13

13:30.760 --> 13:39.180
test week, which is happening right now. Sunday, July 11 through Sunday, July 18, 2021. Refer

13:39.180 --> 13:43.640
to the wiki page we have linked in the show notes for links to the test images you'll

13:43.640 --> 13:46.160
need to participate.

13:46.160 --> 13:50.600
Content production pros have been watching this next feature with a lot of interest.

13:50.600 --> 13:55.520
It's low latency USB audio and it looks to be in pretty good shape to land in kernel

13:55.520 --> 14:01.140
5.14 thanks to some hard work by a subsystem maintainer from SUSE. The goal is to reduce

14:01.140 --> 14:05.980
the latency of USB audio during audio playback. These improvements have been successfully

14:05.980 --> 14:12.000
tested with PulseAudio, Jack, Pipewire, and other userspace software. Now the work to

14:12.000 --> 14:17.480
reduce this latency was sent in last week along with some other patches. But Linus Torvalds

14:17.480 --> 14:21.400
ended up discovering that work hung one of his systems, so he reverted the problematic

14:21.400 --> 14:25.940
code. But the developers have submitted new patches as of Friday. They seem to have those

14:25.940 --> 14:32.220
fixes in there along with the work to reduce that latency in the USB audio driver. So far,

14:32.220 --> 14:36.640
the pull request has landed without any comments by Linus and it appears to be in good shape

14:36.640 --> 14:38.820
to ship this time around.

14:38.820 --> 14:45.220
The Rust for the Linux Kernel project, sponsored by Google, is moving right along. A new set

14:45.220 --> 14:50.500
of patches submitted to the kernel mailing list summarizes the progress of the project,

14:50.500 --> 14:57.920
which aims to enable Rust to be used alongside C. And that progress is significant. Both

14:57.920 --> 15:05.180
the ARM and RISC-V architectures are now supported, and Microsoft's Linux Systems Group hopes

15:05.180 --> 15:12.740
to submit some select Hyper-V drivers written in Rust. Speaking of ARM, they're committing

15:12.740 --> 15:18.660
to help the Rust for Linux project on ARM-based systems, and IBM has also contributed some

15:18.660 --> 15:25.280
support for the PowerPC architecture. And to top things off, there's a new conference

15:25.280 --> 15:32.780
in the works to focus on Rust and the Linux Kernel. More details on that in the future.

15:32.780 --> 15:37.160
And finally in the kernel corner, the news you've all been waiting for. Samsung has posted

15:37.160 --> 15:41.620
patches for a Samba server built into the Linux Kernel. This is the fifth round of these

15:41.620 --> 15:47.180
patches for KSMBD, which used to be known as SysD. And the entire idea is a crazy fast

15:47.180 --> 15:52.860
Samba server implemented in the kernel as an SMB3 compliant server. And while that's

15:52.860 --> 15:58.420
theoretically interesting, something tells me we're never going to see these 32,000 lines

15:58.420 --> 16:03.740
of code get mainlined by Linus. But we'll keep an eye on it.

16:03.740 --> 16:11.440
Back in December, in Linux Action News 168, we informed you about Google acquiring Neverware,

16:11.440 --> 16:17.540
the company behind a Chromium OS fork called CloudReady, which was targeted at regular

16:17.540 --> 16:24.740
PC hardware and users looking for a Windows alternative. One thing CloudReady's live environment

16:24.740 --> 16:32.420
had that Chrome OS does not was a nice graphical installer with a simple-to-find install OS

16:32.420 --> 16:33.420
icon.

16:33.420 --> 16:39.260
Now a recent commit adds a more streamlined installation and icon to Chromium OS proper

16:39.260 --> 16:44.020
upstream. And maybe that's kind of to be expected, but to me the real story here seems clear

16:44.020 --> 16:49.220
that Google is preparing Chrome OS for a wider adoption on general PCs.

16:49.220 --> 16:55.060
That might also explain some of those native Steam on Chrome OS rumors we've been covering.

16:55.060 --> 17:02.260
Indeed. I wonder how that plays out. So if Chrome OS goes mainstream, let's say, makes

17:02.260 --> 17:07.140
it easy to install, easy to find, easy to download, super simple, and it installs on

17:07.140 --> 17:11.620
just about any PC the Linux kernel supports, how does that impact the Linux distribution

17:11.620 --> 17:12.620
market?

17:12.620 --> 17:18.700
And new Linux user adoption? I don't know. I mean, it's kind of hard to say at the moment,

17:18.700 --> 17:24.100
but it will be fascinating to watch Chrome OS try to compete head-to-head both with our

17:24.100 --> 17:30.940
beloved desktop Linux and its other commercial operating system, Breathrend. In some ways,

17:30.940 --> 17:35.160
though, this might be a cleaner fight than what we've got now with all the subsidized

17:35.160 --> 17:36.160
hardware.

17:36.160 --> 17:41.260
Yeah, fascinating indeed. I think it's interesting to watch Google build all of these irons in

17:41.260 --> 17:45.860
the fire, if you will. They have a lot of things that are coming down the pipe that

17:45.860 --> 17:49.860
are going to be pretty impactful to Linux. And we're going to keep track of all of it

17:49.860 --> 17:54.780
and let you know what happens. So go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new

17:54.780 --> 17:55.780

18:00.140 --> 18:03.480
We do have that reunion road trip coming up. Two meetups are scheduled, one in Salt Lake

18:03.480 --> 18:07.940
City and one in Denver. Go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting and sign up.

18:07.940 --> 18:13.500
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.
