00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,760
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,520
This is episode 32, recorded on December 17th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,520
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,520
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,520
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,920
It's good to be connected with you once again.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,920
Amazon has a new Linux release to kick us off?

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,920
What's this?

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,440
Yeah, so Amazon Linux 2, which is really just for their EC2 cloud.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,080
But the big difference now is that unlike the previous version, you can run it on your

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,980
own local machines if you want, albeit not on bare metal.

12
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,000
This is Linux in 2017, early 2018, where when you release a new version of your custom Linux

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,720
distro, you don't even bother with the ISO anymore.

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,280
You release it on Docker Hub or as virtual machine images for VMware, VirtualBox, or

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,240
Microsoft's Hyper-V for on solution deployment.

16
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,280
So I decided, well, I'll give it a go before the show.

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,880
And I deployed it in Docker on my local machine.

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,060
And I would describe it as a very pared down Red Hat enterprise experience.

19
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,800
And when I say pared down, I mean, it doesn't even have PS or top.

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,120
It is a very basic command line system.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,160
And YUM has been configured to point to Amazon repositories for the updates and packages.

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,400
But this support for running it locally is the big story here, I think.

23
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,560
Because although you could run their previous version, which was, they called it Amazon

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,080
Linux AMI, didn't they, 2017.09 was the latest release of it.

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:47,000
It was effectively Amazon Linux 1, let's call it, even though it's not quite called that.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,080
But that one you could only run on EC2.

27
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:55,480
And a lot of people criticize that because it meant that you had to develop your applications

28
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,760
on one operating system and then deploy them on something completely different.

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:05,400
And okay, it's not going to be 100% the same, the EC2 version and the Docker image that

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,080
you're running locally, but it's going to be a lot more similar.

31
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:14,280
And so it's interesting that they've done this, presumably because they want to draw

32
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:20,800
more and more people away from RHEL and CentOS and potentially Ubuntu to use in their own

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Amazon Linux.

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Yeah, perhaps.

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,880
Although I think it might be more to your first point that this is about creating a

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,680
development environment locally that matches what you would deploy on Amazon's ECS or EC2

37
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
infrastructure.

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:39,940
So you have kernel 4.9 inside this thing, you have GCC 7.2.1, glibc 2.25.

39
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:45,040
This is a base operating system, bare base metal operating system for you to build applications

40
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
on top of.

41
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,760
This isn't meant for hobbyist or enthusiast Linux users.

42
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,440
This is truly built for people to just deploy applications on top of.

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,560
They wanted to offer something around an LTS kernel that has system D support, they specifically

44
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,000
call that out actually, and what they say newer tooling and software packages, such

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,480
as Python, MariaDB, Node.js, that you can install from their Amazon Linux extra repository

46
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,080
that's configured.

47
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,440
And you mentioned the long-term support kernel, well, this is going to get five years of long-term

48
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,400
support once we get the final release.

49
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,920
Now, I wouldn't be too surprised if that 4.9 kernel holds it back in raw performance comparisons

50
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
in the future.

51
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,440
It's not that it's that old, so don't take it the wrong way, but in three or four years,

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
it may be holding it back.

53
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,560
In fact, if you look at some of the early benchmarks from Feronix, it already is sort

54
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,360
of lagging behind the competition in raw performance in some instances, which I think is noteworthy

55
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,800
since the entire purpose of this thing is to be a lean, mean performing machine.

56
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,240
Yeah, if you compare it with clear Linux, that is doing a lot better on almost all of

57
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
these benchmarks.

58
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Yeah, and SUSE even does better in some benchmarks as well.

59
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,600
Yeah, but it's funny that Ubuntu kind of comes middle of the road, doesn't it?

60
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,900
It's kind of, as you'd expect, it's quite full featured, but it's lean enough, and that's

61
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,760
why it's a very popular cloud operating system, I think.

62
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,440
So these Feronix benchmarks will be linked in the show notes.

63
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,800
Go to linuxactionnews.com slash 32.

64
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,420
Benchmarks aside, I think this is a pretty clever strategy on Amazon's part.

65
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,880
You build it on something that's an industry standard, you make sure it's supported on

66
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,880
your platform in particular, and now make it available for on-premises deployment.

67
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,500
It's not going to be the biggest version of Linux next year, but if I was a shop that

68
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,800
was looking to build an application that I was going to run on Amazon's infrastructure,

69
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,680
I absolutely would consider this as the base for my operating system.

70
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,180
Well, if you had an application to build, no doubt you'd be doing it on Windows 10 these

71
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,520
days because it pretty much looks like Linux anyway, doesn't it?

72
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,040
Wow, that hits close to home.

73
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,160
It does after you install a different terminal, turn on all the classic stuff, add the Linux

74
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:00,000
subsystem for Windows, install a Linux distribution, and now add the new OpenSSH client that's

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,600
going to be built into Windows 10.

76
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,520
Yeah, so that was part of the Windows subsystem anyway, but now you can just have that if

77
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,660
that's all you need.

78
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,440
If you don't need to do any development locally, but if you just need to SSH out to a server

79
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,480
somewhere, instead of messing around with PuTTY, which people have been using for years,

80
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,480
now you've got native OpenSSH, which is just one more domino of falling, isn't it?

81
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,100
Yeah, it's available already.

82
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,060
If you have the Fall Creators Update and you have a beta option mode, you can, I'm not

83
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:32,060
a big Windows 10 user, as you can tell, but you can actually install this and not just

84
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:38,560
the client, but maybe the bigger news for those of us that used to manage Windows servers,

85
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,840
Microsoft's also including an OpenSSH server.

86
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,960
I've spoken to a few Linux people about this and their reaction was, what?

87
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,400
SSHing into a Windows box?

88
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,280
It's like dogs and cats living together.

89
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,280
The whole world's gone mad, isn't it?

90
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,680
You know why it's useful is when you're building automation scripts that kick off with cron

91
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,800
jobs, you SSH into a system, you grab a file, you SCP a file over.

92
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,400
Windows machines, you always had to come up with some sort of convoluted or proprietary

93
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:14,040
commercial SSH server that you would install and pay an annual fee to use, and it was kind

94
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,720
of like OpenSSH.

95
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,520
To have Microsoft build it is going to make Windows servers fit in with the automation

96
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,860
tools that are being built for all the existing Linux and Unix systems.

97
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,400
And you definitely want to be trusting your private keys with some proprietary SSH server,

98
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
don't you?

99
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,880
You know, that's the part of this that I couldn't even believe.

100
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,880
This is the part where they surprised me.

101
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,880
This is all being done in open source.

102
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,940
In fact, they're working upstream with the official OpenSSH portable project, and they

103
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,840
plan to upstream their code to that project, and they've posted everything at github.com

104
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,480
slash PowerShell slash Win32 dash OpenSSH.

105
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,120
Can you believe you're saying this to me?

106
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,040
When you started podcasting all those years ago, can you even imagine conceivably talking

107
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,560
about this kind of stuff?

108
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,400
We've come so far.

109
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:08,040
This out of almost all of them is the domino I'm the most afraid of.

110
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,440
I have been in the production environment where this is the thing that I needed, but

111
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:21,040
on top of that, the number one response online is sort of collectively, this is the new Microsoft.

112
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:26,720
This is Microsoft is just building the best tool now, and they'll do whatever it takes.

113
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,080
That sentiment has, I think, fully clicked in on the internet now.

114
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:37,320
I think this is almost a bigger deal than them including the Linux subsystem for Windows,

115
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,800
because you could see the strategic reason they did that.

116
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,680
But with OpenSSH, this is genuinely just trying to make people's workflow on Windows a little

117
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
bit better.

118
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,320
The fact that you'll be able to SSH in and the communities already building if you had

119
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,800
installed from the chocolatey repo, a little switcher to let you choose if you go into

120
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,560
Command Prompt or PowerShell or Bash when you SSH into your Windows box.

121
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,520
This really is a new era, Joe.

122
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,160
It really is, and it just shows that open source has become the industry standard to

123
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,040
the point where Microsoft just cannot ignore it anymore.

124
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,920
And it does seem to be a recognition that if Windows 10 is going to be a competitive

125
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,780
development workstation and administration platform, it's got to support these features.

126
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:33,080
And I think this is really going to work in a way that may not be awesome for all Linux.

127
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,480
When you combine the fact that you could now simultaneously, or at least very soon, I should

128
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:43,960
say, run SUSE and Fedora and Ubuntu side by side on a Windows system, have native OpenSSH

129
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:50,560
access, and still run best-of-breed applications like the best implementation maybe of Chrome

130
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,360
or of Telegram on the desktop, and you get the Slack app, and then you have a decent

131
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,940
version of Skype if for some horrible reason you have to use that, it's a pretty compelling

132
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,760
workstation for people that just want to get their work done because now they've got Bash

133
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,880
and they don't have to hassle with all these other little fiddly things.

134
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,560
Yeah, not to mention when five o'clock rolls around, fire up Steam and get the AAA games

135
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,560
running.

136
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,400
I think it's going to be a pretty wide appeal, and that's what gives me pause because of

137
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,920
course I want to see more people using desktop Linux.

138
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,320
I know I mentioned this a couple of weeks ago, but I did try out Windows 10 for a bit

139
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,640
for the Coderadio program and couldn't stick with it.

140
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,260
It was fine, and I can really see why it would work for a lot of people, but it is Windows

141
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,640
and there are still things that really bother me about that platform.

142
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,560
But for others, it may not be as much of an annoyance for them.

143
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,440
Yeah, I don't think that we're going to have Linux users going to Windows.

144
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,560
I think it's more a case of this is going to keep people on Windows who may have possibly

145
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
gone to Linux.

146
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,040
Yeah, that's my thinking too.

147
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,900
Well, us Linux users, Windows users, and even Mac users were united in our outrage at Mozilla's

148
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,560
decision to just slip a little add-on into our Firefox.

149
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,040
Yeah, now this is something that almost passed me by because I didn't actually notice it

150
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,840
in Firefox, but then I read online the outrage about it.

151
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:14,640
And so there's a TV show on the USA network called Mr. Robot, which coincidentally is

152
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,520
about hacking and there's quite a lot of Linux in there.

153
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:22,120
He actually runs Linux Mint on his home desktop, which is quite funny.

154
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,840
Most of the time he uses Kali Linux though.

155
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:31,160
And they have an ARG, an alternate reality game where there's all sorts of clues and

156
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,600
it's kind of this deeper level to enjoy the show, which is okay, fair enough.

157
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,460
I'm not really into that, but some people are.

158
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:43,560
And they did this deal with Mozilla to push out this extension into people's browsers,

159
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,840
which was mostly not turned on by default, although I've heard some reports that it was.

160
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,240
That's a little bit unclear at this stage.

161
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:57,680
That was part of the game without asking people and people were just understandably outraged

162
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
about this.

163
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:05,000
As I say, it passed me by until I read about it because it's removed on my machine, but

164
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,760
I just can't believe that Mozilla would do this.

165
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,120
That's my first reaction to Joe.

166
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,400
And then my second reaction is you just wrote a huge check against all of the great will

167
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,640
you just accumulated for Firefox 57 quantum.

168
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,640
Yeah.

169
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,280
All the people who were considering moving back or who have moved back.

170
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,440
Now I'm thinking, well, hang on, if you're going to do stuff like this, why am I bothering?

171
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,400
I put Firefox 57 on all of my systems except for this one machine I'm sitting in front

172
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,840
of right now and it's at least paused my role a little bit.

173
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,440
I'm not totally sure how I feel about this.

174
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,840
I definitely am upset because the deal I had with Firefox is they were the anti-chrome

175
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,800
and I was trying to get some insight into why Mozilla would do this.

176
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,500
So I did some digging around and I follow some Mozilla employees and some Rust developers

177
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,120
on Twitter and I've seen they're pretty upset as well.

178
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,720
They've also claimed that Mozilla wasn't paid a dime for any of this, that this was the

179
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,920
other way around.

180
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,800
This was going to be a huge promotion for Firefox in the popular Mr. Robot series.

181
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:17,280
And this was, I think, a desperate attempt to capitalize on good momentum.

182
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,080
We've just got a great boost from 57, now we're going to be featured in Mr. Robot and

183
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,520
the thinking must have been people would see this exclusive content tie in with the series

184
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,880
when they watch the show and they would rush to download Firefox again and then they would

185
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
stick with it.

186
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:37,120
Well, that would make sense if it was a show that was as big as, say, The Walking Dead.

187
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,840
But Mr. Robot is on a fairly small network, USA, and my understanding is, I don't know

188
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,440
exact figures, but I think it gets under a million viewers, which is not very much.

189
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,040
And okay, there's quite a lot of people watching on Amazon and Netflix, that sort of thing,

190
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,320
on demand, but it's not a massive show.

191
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,160
It's probably quite a technical audience.

192
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,160
I certainly watch it.

193
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
I think it's quite a good show.

194
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:07,600
I think the third season has been very good, but I just don't see how it's worth burning

195
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,000
this goodwill.

196
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,400
If there's any TV audience out there that would not take this very well, it's the Mr.

197
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:18,240
Robot television audience out of all of the television shows that have maybe have ever

198
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,880
been created.

199
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,600
So you can check anyway, if you are running Firefox, you can go to about colon studies

200
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,880
in the URL bar and see if it's installed and there's a button there, update preferences,

201
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,360
which takes you to about preferences and then hash privacy.

202
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,520
And then you can untick the box for allow Firefox to send technical interaction data

203
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,800
to Mozilla and also allow Firefox to install and run studies.

204
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,000
Now this studies thing is how they managed to push this out to people without them noticing.

205
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,480
And I cannot believe that that is on by default.

206
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,400
What's the point of running a free software open source browser if the vendor can push

207
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,480
plugins and add-ons and stuff and stuff that I don't need crap basically.

208
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,880
So I urge people go to that and turn that stuff off if you want to be protected against

209
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
this.

210
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,400
And okay, it's not nefarious.

211
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
It's not malware.

212
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,760
Although people were very confused by it because it wasn't even clear that it was coming from

213
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,320
this Mr. Robot show.

214
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,600
It would just seem like this weird malware that had been added.

215
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,640
But who knows, at the moment, Mozilla has been run by people who don't have nefarious

216
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:35,080
intentions I don't think, but you never know if someone compromised their servers or something,

217
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,320
this could be a mechanism to push stuff in.

218
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,800
So this is just a catalog of errors from Mozilla, errors of judgment and technical errors, and

219
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,760
I'm just very disappointed with them.

220
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,680
I think it betrays a deep misunderstanding of their core base.

221
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,320
The pocket stuff, I think, is what comes to people's mind is the first time this really

222
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
happened.

223
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,600
But since then, there's also been the clicks controversy, which only a few users in Germany

224
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,400
were subjected to, but it was basically full on every URL you visit type surveillance with

225
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,800
one of their partners.

226
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,420
And I'm going to now be turning all of this stuff off on all my machines.

227
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,240
And I've always left it on because I wanted to register as a Linux user.

228
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,880
I wanted their metric servers to collect an active Linux instance and hoping that maybe

229
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,120
some of those Windows users were turning it off, and us Linux users were leaving it on

230
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,480
to show our vote to keep supporting Linux, and now I've got to turn it all off.

231
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,480
And I find that to be really unfortunate.

232
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,960
I would only be presuming what's going on over at Mozilla, but I really hope there is

233
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,480
an honest reflection on this moment where they can say to themselves, we are clearly

234
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,940
disconnected with the relationship that people have with our web browser, and we have now

235
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,320
made three very glaring mistakes where we have violated their trust and their privacy,

236
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:53,160
and we cannot build our brand around privacy, security, and web standards when we keep making

237
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
these mistakes.

238
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,840
Well, you mentioned Pocket.

239
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
Don't worry.

240
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:04,280
They acquired Pocket earlier this year, and they're going to open source it anytime now.

241
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,360
Last.ting.com.

242
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,780
Go there to support this show, but also get $25 in Ting service credits if you bring a

243
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:13,200
device or get $25 off of a Ting cell phone.

244
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,800
It's a smarter way to do mobile.

245
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,160
The average Ting bill is just $23 per month per phone.

246
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:23,180
It's $6 for your line, and then your usage on top of that.

247
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,240
So if you have Wi-Fi at work and you have Wi-Fi at home, then you're really probably

248
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,720
only using your mobile data on a day-to-day basis when you're commuting, at least mostly

249
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,800
in my case, or maybe when a special occasion comes up and I'm out and about, I'm out Christmas

250
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
shopping.

251
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,080
So I love this system because it's sort of like hacking the system.

252
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,580
I can get by some months and not make a phone call, and that's amazing.

253
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,380
Sometimes I'll just do it all over Skype, or I'll do it all over Telegram.

254
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,520
It's wonderful.

255
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
It's a simple system for technical people.

256
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,840
It's just pay for what you use, and they have CDMA and GSM systems.

257
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Go check it out.

258
00:16:55,840 --> 00:17:01,440
Go to last.ting.com, nationwide coverage, no contracts, pay for what you use, last.ting.com.

259
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:09,200
All right, Chris, it's time to get our tinfoil hats on and time to start frying that conspiracy

260
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
bacon.

261
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,240
I do love my conspiracy bacon, Joe.

262
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,200
Yeah, let's talk about the Intel management engine again.

263
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:22,360
And so it's come out this week that starting with Intel management engine version 12, Intel

264
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,440
are going to put a hardware lock to stop these downgrade attacks.

265
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,080
So they're going to stop you overwriting the firmware.

266
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,720
And that was one of the big attack vectors, but this is something that you had speculated

267
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,200
was going to happen to stop people being able to disable the management engine in the first

268
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
place.

269
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,920
And it seems that you were right about that.

270
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,400
Yeah, we weren't quite sure which direction would it go.

271
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,940
Would they double down and try to prevent this, or would they offer a line of processors

272
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,160
without the management engine, which would have been the much better scenario.

273
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,720
I suppose if you really buy this concept that this is a fundamental feature you must have,

274
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,520
and I acknowledge it probably is useful for some network administrators and businesses.

275
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Absolutely.

276
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:10,480
But if you accept the fundamental fact that it's useful for all of the systems, then I

277
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,680
guess you would just double down on securing it because otherwise it's an attack vector.

278
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,560
But is this even going to work?

279
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,480
Are people just going to find a way around it?

280
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,020
Well, they thought they'd built an unhackable system before, I would imagine.

281
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,180
So people generally find the weak spots.

282
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:29,000
There may be a weak spot in the fact that OEMs have the option to turn this on or off.

283
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,720
It ships as disabled by default for now.

284
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,460
And then your HPs and Dells and Lenovo's of the world have to toggle it back on.

285
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,260
I think this recent spate of stories about this has really gone to illustrate one thing.

286
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,200
The Intel has got a lot of clever people working for them on this kind of stuff, but you cannot

287
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,640
beat the wisdom of the crowds.

288
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,760
And if you've got an entire world of people hacking this thing, they're going to find

289
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,200
problems with it.

290
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,800
And if it's not open, and if your whole outlook on it and your whole approach to it isn't

291
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:09,800
an open wisdom of the crowds, many eyeballs approach, then you're going to keep running

292
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
into these problems.

293
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,760
And it's just essentially an arms race at this point because it's got enough publicity

294
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,480
that no matter what Intel do now, there's going to be so many people hammering on it,

295
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,160
trying to beat it to make a name for themselves at things like Black Hat Europe and stuff.

296
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,280
They're creating demand.

297
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,040
They're creating demand for a product.

298
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,380
Yeah, exactly.

299
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:34,160
And so they've got to give up at some point and either properly open source it, which

300
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,020
doesn't seem likely, or offer proper hardware kill switches for it.

301
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,920
That's the only solution.

302
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,120
Purism has gotten a little bit of publicity out of this announcement as well.

303
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,180
The Register went to Todd Weaver, the CEO of Purism, to get a quote about this.

304
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,040
There is now a product category that is being defined by Intel.

305
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,160
And it's ironic that they don't see it because they could sell to this very market themselves

306
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,160
a product that doesn't have the management engine.

307
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,720
Or is it just that we're trapped in this FOSS bubble that we care about this stuff?

308
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,640
Yeah, I think it probably tints our view on this a bit.

309
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
I think that's a fair question to ask.

310
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,680
I don't necessarily think it means we're wrong, though.

311
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,680
When you have a core fundamental piece of technology like this, history has shown us

312
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,680
more eyes is almost always a good thing.

313
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:20,600
And you'd kind of expect Intel to have that opinion as well since they've been around

314
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,280
the tech industry for a little while.

315
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:28,160
And these things almost never, ever end well for any company that goes down this path.

316
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,800
But we just don't know all of their motivations in this as well.

317
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,700
And we also don't know if this is the final say.

318
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,240
Intel says they will likely toggle this to on by default in the near future and recommend

319
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,240
that OEMs do that themselves today.

320
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,080
They may also be somewhere in the boardroom drawing up plans right now for a management

321
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,680
free version of the Intel chip.

322
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,680
Who knows?

323
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,100
We'll just have to wait and see where this thing goes.

324
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,240
But right now, I'm not too surprised they've made this step, if maybe just a bit disappointed.

325
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,240
Yeah.

326
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,240
All right.

327
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,920
Any update on this Conservancy and Software Freedom Law Center situation?

328
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:06,040
This is a post on the Software Freedom Conservancy's blog from Bradley who runs the Conservancy.

329
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,520
And it is confirming some things that people suspected and clarifying other things that

330
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,580
people have speculated as well.

331
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:18,080
And in it, he links to the full filing, where they are trying to just go for a dismissal.

332
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,080
Essentially, they're building a case around three core points.

333
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:28,080
Number one, the law center knew the Conservancy's name because they helped establish the Conservancy

334
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,840
and provided legal counsel for six years.

335
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,580
They have invited the Conservancy to many events where they promoted their services

336
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,000
and even encouraged projects to seek them out.

337
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,460
And the third tier is this is a personal vendetta between Eben Moglen and Bradley and Karen.

338
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,880
And they make this case in a long 168-page legal filing.

339
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,580
I read the entire thing.

340
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,640
The most salacious page is 29.

341
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,340
And if you want to read it yourself, you really only need to read the first 36 pages.

342
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:06,800
But in these 36 pages, and then they give exhibits, they build a case of years of dialogue

343
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,780
between the Conservancy and the law center where lots of grievances have been aired,

344
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,820
but the trademark was never one of them.

345
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,440
It's going to be very interesting to see what the law center comes back with against this

346
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,640
because based on this evidence, it does seem like they don't have any case against this

347
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
trademark, do they?

348
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,540
Because as you say, there's been a lot of back and forth over the years, but this is

349
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,820
the first time they've ever mentioned the trademark.

350
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,120
So it just seems like a spurious suit to me.

351
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,360
And they're filing.

352
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,760
They make a pretty clear case that it's bad blood.

353
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,540
But in some parts, they use very plain English about the situation in a way that does feel

354
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,440
a bit like airing of dirty laundry.

355
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,600
It's a little unfortunate to see this have to take place.

356
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:57,860
And I think Bradley even reflects a bit in his post saying that the speculation and the

357
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,600
energy that's gone towards people constructing narratives around this is energy that should

358
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,100
go towards free software.

359
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,760
I completely agree.

360
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:11,740
Unfortunately, the ramifications, if the Freedom Software Law Center were successful, the ramifications

361
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,080
would, would really split the open source community because we're talking about some

362
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,140
projects that are under the conservancy umbrella that really matter to people.

363
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,520
And if you go to their website, they have a list.

364
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,680
And I guarantee you, there are projects on that list you care about.

365
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,600
That is true, but I'm not worried somehow.

366
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:37,000
I just don't think that there's enough of a case here to warrant any sleepless nights

367
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
here.

368
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,640
It's just a spat that's got out of control and I just think it's going to end quietly

369
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,680
rather than in a big bang.

370
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:52,480
But one thing that's missing from all of this update is the Linux kernel community enforcement

371
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,840
statement stuff, which we speculated at the time was the kind of catalyst for this.

372
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,760
But there's been no mention of that, has there?

373
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,400
Yeah, because I think their position is that's not really what this is about.

374
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,680
Do we believe that?

375
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,680
I do.

376
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,720
I do because the legal process started back in September, before the announcement was

377
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
even made.

378
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,360
I mean, I'm sure that the background work to that large agreement between all 200 kernel

379
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,640
developers that had copyright, I'm sure that took a long time.

380
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,720
So I'm sure Mr. Moglen was aware of it.

381
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,160
But when you read the law center's blog, this feels more like it's a competitive, we want

382
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,200
to start offering these types of services move and we don't like these people and less

383
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,880
about the specifics around the kernel enforcement strategy.

384
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,400
My only pause with all of this, Joe, is I think you're probably right.

385
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,740
I think the Conservancy has a great case here.

386
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,840
They're smart people and they're very direct in their legal filing.

387
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,400
It's just that even Moglen is not new.

388
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,360
He has been around for a long time and he really knows law.

389
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,680
So if there was anybody I'd be afraid to go to war with in the courtroom, it would be

390
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
him.

391
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,980
Well, like I said last time, I just want to see an end to this as soon as possible.

392
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,620
This just cannot be good for free software, open source, Linux, any of the stuff we talk

393
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,240
about and cover and use every day.

394
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,320
I just want to see this done and dusted and let's move on.

395
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,600
Yeah, I completely agree.

396
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,080
And hopefully the Conservancy's motion for a summary judgment here will be successful

397
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,320
because that will be the least costly and most time efficient process if they are successful.

398
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
Yeah.

399
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,840
Okay, so let's end with some Jupyter broadcasting news.

400
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,960
And there's been a reboot of TechSnap with you and Wes.

401
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,660
Yeah, episode 348 just went out on the feeds a couple of days ago and that's where the

402
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,660
reboot hits.

403
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,240
Wes and I are rebuilding the show.

404
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,740
We're going to be adding new stuff and we're hoping people get in on the ground floor.

405
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,980
We're revamping the production.

406
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,880
We've got a ton of stuff planned.

407
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,640
New website as well, TechSnap.systems and you can put the RSS feed in your favorite

408
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,580
podcast catcher, TechSnap.systems.rss.

409
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,200
We're trying out some new stuff with the show.

410
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,720
Took some lessons we've learned from Linux Action News and we're applying it to TechSnap

411
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,240
and I'm trying out chapters and time coding in the podcast player.

412
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,440
And people so far are really liking that.

413
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,580
So when you look in a podcast player that supports it, everything's time coded.

414
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,400
You can jump to those sections in the show.

415
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,680
So we're doing some new stuff with it too.

416
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,920
So it's just, I'd like some feedback on that as well if people want to check it out.

417
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:21,400
But come on, the most important thing is no more BSD nonsense.

418
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,040
It's two Linux users now.

419
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,040
Yeah.

420
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,760
So we might slip it in from time to time, rumor has it Alan Jude may make a wild appearance

421
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,760
every now and then on the show.

422
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,520
Oh yeah, you can't escape ZFS on that show, can you?

423
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,040
You gotta go to Alan Jude when you got the hard ZFS questions.

424
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,460
In the meantime, we hope you keep coming back to this show.
