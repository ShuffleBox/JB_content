00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,180
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,380
This is episode six, recorded on June 18th, 2017.

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,380
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,380
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,420
Yes, and hello to everyone out there, including the fathers.

6
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,340
Happy Father's Day to you.

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,980
Today we have quite the gift.

8
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:31,400
It has been a busy news week in open source, and I think our first story is probably our

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,400
favorite.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,720
I'm pretty happy to announce that a friend of the show, Mr. Aiki, founder of Solus, is

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,240
going full time with the project.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,100
Yeah, he came on Unplugged, didn't he, this week and talked about it.

13
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,220
And it's excellent news.

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,720
It's excellent news for him personally.

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,000
And it's excellent news for Solus as a project.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,120
Some people have doubted that they were serious about it, even though looking at the project,

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,160
I don't know how you could do that.

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,960
But now instead of just doing it in his spare time, he's going to be full time on it, putting

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,140
all his resources into it and treating it as a proper job.

20
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,160
And so he's relying on Patreon to do that.

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,660
So he's taking a pay cut, but it's got to be good news for Solus.

22
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,440
And I think the wider Linux ecosystem, certainly the desktop ecosystem, because it's going

23
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,040
to drive more competition.

24
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Yep.

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,860
I think that's exactly why we both thought it was a good idea to put it right here is

26
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,160
as two desktop Linux users, we're very excited to see the competition step up a notch and

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,560
it's going to be great for everybody.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,560
Yeah.

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,120
And it's probably going to accelerate the KDE version, which you know is coming.

30
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,000
We're going to get a KDE ISO sooner or later, Plasma desktop.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,920
And it just means that his plan to move to Qt and everything is going to be accelerated

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,360
because it's amazing how much work him and the other guys on the team get done part time.

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,400
So now in a few weeks when he goes full time on it, I think it's just going to accelerate

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,240
and it's going to be unbelievable development pace.

35
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,840
I think a lot of projects have been working hard.

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,440
In fact, we have some release news to get through starting with Debian 9 Stretch released

37
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,240
yesterday after 26 months of development.

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,600
Debian presents the new stable version 9 codename Stretch, which is going to be supported for

39
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
the next five years.

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,440
Yeah, after 26 months, it's finally ready.

41
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,740
And there's some good stuff in here.

42
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,760
If you install it, it's not that much different from 8.

43
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,320
But if you look at the release notes, you find that they have done a lot of stuff here.

44
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,600
And I think one of the most important ones is the reproducible builds project.

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:35,280
So over 90% of Debian 9 is reproducible, which means that you can actually produce an exact

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,480
binary using the source code because that's something I've often not worried about.

47
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,840
But it's something I've thought about that you've got the source code and you've got

48
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,240
the binary, but unless you can produce a binary that is exactly the same, then should you

49
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,240
trust it?

50
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,920
Well, coming from Debian, yes, and you have all sorts of signing and stuff where I'm not

51
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
particularly worried.

52
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,840
But I think that it is important for open source to have this reproducibility.

53
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,320
And it's good to see Debian making effort here and making it over 90% of the packages

54
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
in Debian are going to be reproducible.

55
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,320
That's great.

56
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
Yeah, that's huge.

57
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,520
And it's really an important verification feature, which some very high security installations

58
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,820
require.

59
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,360
Also kind of notable, I think they made the big first switch to the modern branch of GnuPG

60
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,360
in this version of Debian.

61
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,520
So that's also kind of a nice security improvement.

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,480
And of course, for us desktop users, Firefox and Thunderbird are officially back in stretch.

63
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,200
They are replacing the de-branded versions of Ice Weasel and Ice Dove.

64
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,120
Yeah, it's good that they finally sorted that out.

65
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,880
They sorted out a while back, but now we've got a proper release with it.

66
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,220
Hopefully we can just put that stuff behind us now.

67
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,800
And speaking of Debian 9, Tails 3.0 is out this week, which is based on stretch.

68
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,840
Yeah, which is the ultimate privacy distro, isn't it?

69
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,780
They really are stepping it up too.

70
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,120
So they have something they've been working on hard for a while.

71
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,240
I think like three years in the making is Tails Greeter, which is an application that

72
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,040
configures Tails at startup.

73
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,960
And it's been completely redesigned for ease of use.

74
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,500
Now, the whole idea with Tails is to give users a secure out of the box experience that

75
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,240
supports encrypted storage, GPG, all of the features you might want for online banking,

76
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
cryptocurrency, or if you're just a little paranoid.

77
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,660
And now they're trying to bridge that gap with things like the Greeter and other features

78
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,200
like polishing their GNOME desktop that make it just basically a usable desktop distro

79
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
now.

80
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,720
Yeah, and of course, Tor, we can't forget that.

81
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,280
That's one of the major selling points here, that all the traffic is routed through Tor.

82
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,000
Yeah, and they make it really easy to use proxy services and set up VPNs.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's pretty nice.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,320
Like Tor Browser 7.01, which is based on Firefox 52, which is kind of nice because that's a

85
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,120
long term support version of 52.

86
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,020
Yeah, they call it ESR, don't they?

87
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,020
Extended Support Release.

88
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,480
Yeah, Extended Support Release.

89
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,800
And there's also one caveat with Tails 3.0.

90
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,960
This is the version they've dropped 32-bit support.

91
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,960
So older machines, kind of out of the picture, it's going to only work on 64-bit systems.

92
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,560
But to be fair, is GNOME going to work on a 32-bit only system?

93
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,800
Not very well.

94
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Probably not.

95
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,000
Other gotcha, and it doesn't apply across the board, but Tails is failing to start on

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,720
some computers with Intel graphics, and there's a link in the show notes about that.

97
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,520
Yeah, and it's pretty picky about what USB sticks it will work on.

98
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,320
It didn't work on my USB 3.0 SanDisk one, because they apparently can't be trusted.

99
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,280
But then I tried another USB 2.0 one, and waited and waited for it to DD, and waited

100
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,520
and waited for it to boot, and that worked fine.

101
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:35,320
Congratulations, you have met bug 12696 in their database, which is something wrong with

102
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,520
working with some types of USB media.

103
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,200
And did you get the error skipping non-removable device or something to that degree?

104
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
Because there is a workaround.

105
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,720
No, I can't remember what it was now.

106
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,040
I think it was just sort of a black screen in the end.

107
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Okay.

108
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,400
You might check in the known issues section, there is a workaround you can use, a little

109
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,560
pearl magic, and for some reason, I guess it opens up more USB sticks.

110
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Okay.

111
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,120
But the big question here is, are we actually going to use this for anything?

112
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,440
I'm happy enough with a standard Xubuntu desktop that's fully up to date to do my online banking.

113
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,560
I don't have any real need for Tor apart from a bit of testing.

114
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,880
Is it something that you're going to use?

115
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,520
Because for me, I've tested it out, and it's good to know it's there.

116
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,920
But personally, I can't see myself using it.

117
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,960
If I was still in the position of owning a lot of Bitcoin, and I mean a lot, and I wanted

118
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,040
to move large amounts around or something like that, I could see myself booting this

119
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,320
up in a virtual environment or having a computer dedicated to certain types of communication.

120
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,560
There have been moments where I've had a couple of email exchanges where I had to be really

121
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,800
kind of careful with the email, and I could see a machine dedicated running a distribution

122
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
like this.

123
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,600
But for the most part, I'm kind of drawing a blank for my personal use.

124
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,280
I don't think I'm fancy and important enough.

125
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,480
I'm not like some secret agent or some millionaire working with funds.

126
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,800
Just a podcaster in Washington, so I don't really have a need for it.

127
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,200
Yeah, there are some people who are going to find this very useful, journalists dealing

128
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,320
with Snowden and that kind of thing.

129
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Absolutely.

130
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
Yeah, that's a very good point.

131
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
And in some countries as well.

132
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,000
I mean, the UK is getting that way, so maybe I'll have more use for it in the future.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's true.

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,520
And things can always change here in the States.

135
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,560
So something that might apply to more of us is Firefox 54.

136
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,480
It's luring you back in, Chrome Switchers, with its new content process, a separate UI

137
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,920
process, and get ready for it, ladies and gentlemen, a GPU acceleration process.

138
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,000
Yeah, it's only been eight years they've been working on this, so finally, we get there.

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,600
You like that I left that part out to make you say it?

140
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,920
Yeah, I did totally stop there.

141
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:36,880
I know I am kind of a little underwhelmed because it's also not available for a lot

142
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,000
of us if you have add-ons that block it, which is the case on Ubuntu right now.

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,440
Yeah, the box with Ubuntu, because of the Ubuntu modifications add-on, that doesn't

144
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
work with it.

145
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,080
But I think that will get fixed fairly soon, hopefully.

146
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
I agree.

147
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,400
And one of the great things about Firefox is the add-ons, and I've got a ton running.

148
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,480
And so therefore, all it takes is one of them to not be compatible, and then I don't get

149
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,560
this benefit.

150
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,040
And so that's why when I first heard it was having this multi-process architecture, I

151
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,720
was using it and thinking, it's not really any different.

152
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,320
And then I read a bit more about it, OK, that's why, because of my add-ons.

153
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,300
Right, and that's really my favorite thing about Firefox as well.

154
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,900
But there is a path.

155
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,480
So Firefox 54 includes the new Web Extension APIs, which are hooks that allow for add-ons

156
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,440
that work across multiple types of browsers.

157
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,980
And in November, when Firefox, I think, 57 is released, Firefox is only going to support

158
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,580
the add-ons that use Web Extension APIs.

159
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,440
Everything else is going away, including Firefox's original Zul overlay add-ons.

160
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,060
And you talk about Firefox 57, I remember the big upgrade from 3 to 3.5, it makes you

161
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,140
feel old, doesn't it?

162
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,560
These numbers, Joe, no, these numbers are ridiculous.

163
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,360
I remember when it hit 13, and I thought, wow, Firefox 13.

164
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,800
And then Chrome comes along with its 60s, and it's just getting out of control.

165
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Yeah.

166
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,000
Do you think this is too little too late for Firefox?

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,400
Because the market share, most people use Chrome now.

168
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,760
Even on Windows, they're not using IE and Edge.

169
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,400
They're basically using Chrome because they've just realized that it's a much better experience.

170
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,720
And Firefox just seems to have fallen by the wayside.

171
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,920
Yeah, it's default in a lot of desktop Linux distros, but one of the first things people

172
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,320
do is install Chrome, but presumably that's one of the first things you do when you install

173
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
a distro.

174
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
Admittedly, yes.

175
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,120
And I think it's going to be that way for a while.

176
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,760
I don't think it's ever too late.

177
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,920
It's not like the web's going anywhere, and Chrome's not getting any smaller.

178
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,400
And Firefox can just keep chipping away at this, and it could end up being the iPhone

179
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,780
Android situation where a smaller percentage of the market is on iPhone, but generally

180
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,560
those consumers are more appealing to developers, so they release on the iOS platform first.

181
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,440
Something like that could happen with the Firefox Chrome situation where Chrome ends

182
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,400
up being the vast majority, but Firefox walks away with a solid 20% maybe.

183
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,220
I'm totally making up numbers here, but you see how there could be a bit of victory for

184
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,880
Firefox without having to be the king.

185
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,540
Well, talking about tails there, that's what Firefox is great for, isn't it?

186
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:14,680
The fact that it is completely open source and can be used for other projects like tails

187
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,920
and the Tor browser.

188
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,400
Whereas with Chrome, okay, you've got Chromium that you can use, but even that needs some

189
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,420
proprietary stuff.

190
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:30,320
So if you care about privacy, then Firefox is the browser for you, presumably.

191
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,120
I think they could make the performance argument pretty soon as well.

192
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,840
Benchmarks that we've linked in the show notes from ours show that it's pretty competitive

193
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,640
in memory usage and speed.

194
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,720
Yeah, but it just doesn't have that brand loyalty that it once did.

195
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,080
It was once upon a time before Chrome came along, it was just huge, wasn't it?

196
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,560
It was starting to seriously compete with Internet Explorer, whereas now Chrome has

197
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
taken over.

198
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,920
I think it was a few weeks ago there was that Chrome has won post.

199
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,920
Yeah.

200
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,520
Well, I kind of feel optimistic if they just keep going in this direction, but there is

201
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,640
also just a bit of housekeeping with the 54 release.

202
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,720
Mozilla has shut down the Aurora release channel instead of a four-stage release pipeline

203
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,520
where they have nightly, Aurora, beta, and then stable.

204
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,600
Firefox will now just jump from nightly to the beta channel, cleaning things up a little

205
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
bit.

206
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,240
Yeah, simplifying things.

207
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm not going to miss it personally.

208
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,740
Maybe some people will, but if it lets them concentrate more on things like this multiprocess

209
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,520
stuff, then I'm all for it.

210
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,720
Yeah, it's more straightforward.

211
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,200
To be honest with you, I always found it a little confusing as an outsider.

212
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
I thought it was a little excessive.

213
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:43,320
I could see needing a channel like that internally, but for the public testing it seemed too much.

214
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,720
Keep it simple with DigitalOcean.

215
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,280
Go to digitalocean.com and use the promo code, here's the thing, after you've created your

216
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
account.

217
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,240
You hit that, it applies to your account, and you get a $10 credit.

218
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,320
DigitalOcean is a simple, fast, easy way to spin up a Linux system on a great infrastructure.

219
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,120
You can get deployed within seconds.

220
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,000
All systems use SSD, from the itty-bitties to the huge, ginormous monster systems.

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,880
They have super-fast lightning network, up to 40 gigabits into the hypervisors with data

222
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,720
centers all over the world, a simple, intuitive API to work with it, storage you can attach

223
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,480
easily, and one of my favorite features with DigitalOcean is their documentation.

224
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,800
They have a lot of one-click deployment, open source projects, but then, of course, you

225
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,560
start using these things and they're awesome, you want to take it a little further.

226
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,840
Here's one they've just posted recently.

227
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,840
It really would work on any Ubuntu system.

228
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:34,040
Here's a tutorial on how to enable SFTP without shell access on Ubuntu 16.04.

229
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,040
Go take advantage of that.

230
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,520
Go to DigitalOcean.com, and if you create an account, use our promo code, Here's the

231
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:44,000
Thing, DigitalOcean.com, promo code, Here's the Thing, great cloud servers in 55 seconds

232
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,180
or less, DigitalOcean.com, promo code, Here's the Thing.

233
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:54,800
Last week, we talked about the Ubuntu kernel live patching coming to 14.04, and we had

234
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,640
quite a few questions about that.

235
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:03,200
Joe, you reached out to Dustin Kirkland about this, didn't you, and he got back with some

236
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,680
very thorough answers.

237
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,840
Yeah, he sure did.

238
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,120
So Dustin Kirkland's the Ubuntu product and strategy guy at Canonical and also, I think,

239
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,120
one of the main people behind livepatch because I chatted with him right when it came out.

240
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,520
So I knew he would be the guy to ask, and Joe, you really stumped me.

241
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,640
You said, well, what happens if, say, you've been running for eight to nine months with

242
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,900
livepatches coming in, you've never rebooted your system, and the power goes out or your

243
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,160
system crashes and reboots, are all those patches reinstalled or do you boot up with a vulnerable

244
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,460
kernel again?

245
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:32,480
And so Dustin's response kind of broke down in two ways.

246
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,000
He said, first of all, they release an Ubuntu kernel update every three weeks, like Clockwork.

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,960
So if you install that kernel patch every three weeks, you get all of the updates.

248
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,400
But assuming you haven't been installing your patches every three weeks and your system

249
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,120
reboots or you needed to reboot an old kernel for software compatibility, then yeah, initially

250
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,320
it would boot up as an unpatched kernel, and then after 60 seconds, the livepatches would

251
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,860
be reapplied back to the system, right back into memory.

252
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:00,860
And why 60 seconds?

253
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,240
So that's just in case there's any kind of critical issues, you could stop it.

254
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,680
And depending on how old your kernel is, you could have many livepatches.

255
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,200
We speculated there probably hadn't been a lot of livepatches.

256
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,880
Well, Dustin's been running it on his local system, and he has 44 livepatches applied

257
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
to his system alone.

258
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,960
Yeah, and he said that there have been hundreds to date because we speculated there were only

259
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
a few, as you say.

260
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,240
But no, there have been hundreds.

261
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,320
Yeah, it's fascinating the way this system works.

262
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
And I was confused.

263
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,520
It's like, how are you doing this?

264
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,640
Are you delivering these as apt packages?

265
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,720
Are they available to my package manager?

266
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,100
Can I uninstall them?

267
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,880
And it's the patches that they release as a standard release every three weeks, those

268
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,160
come down as standard apt packages.

269
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,920
But the live kernel patches are being delivered with Snap.

270
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah, which we shouldn't be surprised about, given that that is what Canonical is putting

271
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,760
most of their resources into seemingly these days.

272
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,400
Yeah, but talk about a real dogfooding experience here.

273
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,040
I mean, this has got to be one of the most critical ways they could use Snap packages,

274
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,160
if there was one, and in scale.

275
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,920
That's a pretty big testament to Snap packages.

276
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,160
Yeah, and the fact that they rolled it out in production to anyone who wants it means

277
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,560
that they must be confident with it.

278
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,200
Yeah, he also sent me just a quick setup on how to get started on my 1604 system.

279
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,040
And also today, I noticed that they are including some graphical options in future releases

280
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,080
of Ubuntu to get started.

281
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,240
So that could be really interesting.

282
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,360
Yeah, that's going to lower the barrier to entry, which I suppose is good, but I still

283
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,360
stand by my concerns.

284
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,000
I mean, okay, fair enough.

285
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:32,400
You've got this 60 seconds, but I just, I like to apply the patches, reboot, and no,

286
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
that's it.

287
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,840
Well, you could do that every three weeks and be solid, and then this live patch service

288
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,800
would just sort of get you in between if there was something major, like a major vulnerability

289
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
that came down the road.

290
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,880
Yeah, I think that is the use case that I would have for it, really.

291
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,280
Big thank you to Dustin, though, for a really complete response.

292
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,880
It really helped improve my understanding of how it works, and it seems like a really

293
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,440
solid system.

294
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,080
And I'm going to try it out, and I'll report back to you guys at some point.

295
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,720
I look forward to hearing about it.

296
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,560
So let's stay with Ubuntu kind of, and as we know, they dropped that bombshell a few

297
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:11,720
months ago about abandoning Unity and Convergence and Ubuntu Touch, but Ubiports, who were originally

298
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,640
just about porting Ubuntu Touch to new devices, vowed to carry on with it.

299
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:23,320
And some people were skeptical, including me, I'm afraid, but here we are with the first

300
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,560
stable over-the-air update.

301
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,360
And I've tried it out on a Nexus 5, and I must say, it's working pretty well.

302
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:40,360
I don't know if that's where Ubuntu was just before it was axed, you know, shut down, or

303
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,960
whether it's the work of the Ubiports guys, because I had kind of, I'd seen it coming,

304
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:49,640
so I'd kind of lost interest in Ubuntu Touch, to be honest.

305
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:56,320
Whereas now, my interest has ramped up, definitely, with this OTA, and they're calling it stable,

306
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,640
and from my brief testing of it today, I think it's fair to call it stable.

307
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,380
You know, Joe, I think it's a little of both, reading the release notes.

308
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:08,140
It seems like a lot of hard work has gone into this, and they've implemented some new

309
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,880
features like the Open Store, have you had a chance to look at that?

310
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,340
Yeah, I had a quick look at it.

311
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,000
One thing that jumped out at me is, you don't need an account to install apps, you can just

312
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,040
open it up and just start installing stuff, which I think is great.

313
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,980
That was always a bit of an annoyance before, having to create an Ubuntu account and give

314
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,040
them my email address and everything, whereas now, just open up Open Store and start installing

315
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
stuff.

316
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
Wow, that is really impressive.

317
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,040
Big tip of the hat.

318
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,880
And I'm sure, you know, things could always change, but that's nice just to be able to

319
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
get started.

320
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,920
Speaking of just being able to get started, a terminal and a file browser are now pre-installed.

321
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
You know, it's the little things.

322
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,720
Yeah, and the terminal, I took some photos and then SCPed them up to another machine,

323
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,280
worked absolutely perfectly, and it's so refreshing to have a proper Linux box in your hand rather

324
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,720
than trying to install apps and try and hack things to get a proper terminal going.

325
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,960
Now, I'm going to be real with you, this isn't going to get me away from a mainstream smartphone

326
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,280
anytime soon, but I am so thankful to see projects out there that are hedging against

327
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Android.

328
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,960
And one of the things this project is involved with is Hallium.

329
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,120
As you may know, we've talked about it, I think, in brief on Jupyter Broadcasting in

330
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,120
the past, but it's a layer that's going to standardize the Android hardware compatibility

331
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,080
between Linux distributions.

332
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,960
So this layer is something that they can all target, and it solves the problem that Android

333
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,280
device drivers can't be used natively in a regular Linux system.

334
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,200
Yeah, it aims to de-duplicate effort, doesn't it, whereas you had all these projects doing

335
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,680
the same thing.

336
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,680
Now they've decided to get together, like Plasma Mobile, for example.

337
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,160
And so it's good to see that that is actually coming along now.

338
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,320
Yeah, the Plasma Mobile folks showed off Plasma Mobile running on a Fairphone 2 using that

339
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,240
Hallium intermediary layer today, I think, or yesterday.

340
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,000
So it's getting pretty close.

341
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,920
And that's, if nothing else, something that's going to be benefiting a lot of open source

342
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,920
projects.

343
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,720
And something else that's interesting in this announcement is they're talking about

344
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,680
Andbox, which is a way to run Android apps on Linux.

345
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:13,080
And they accept, it's really good to see that unlike Canonical, UbiPorts accept that it

346
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,480
is very important for them to be able to run Android apps on Ubuntu.

347
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,920
Well, it's UbiPorts, that's another thing.

348
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,760
They don't know what to call it, but you know, we'll get to that.

349
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,480
Yeah, that's up in the air for now.

350
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,160
Andbox, though, does look interesting.

351
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,080
They compare it to Wine for Linux, and they say it's probably not going to be the same.

352
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,200
But they believe apps like WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Netflix may be usable in Andbox, which

353
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,000
that would be great for the platform.

354
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,440
That seems very ambitious, given that they're going to have to rely on Google Play services

355
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,440
and stuff.

356
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,160
So they're going to have to get that stuff going.

357
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,980
But at least they're thinking about this stuff.

358
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:54,960
And it's something that, I don't know, was it arrogance of Canonical to not consider

359
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Android compatibility?

360
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,640
Because if you look at something like Sailfish, that has got it, Tizen has got it to some

361
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,920
degree.

362
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,280
And I think it is important to have that for your new platform.

363
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,400
Because if you can get Android apps running, then it opens up so many more apps than the

364
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,600
small number of native ones you have, and attracts people to your platform.

365
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,720
Arrogance could be one way to describe it.

366
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,500
I would be more charitable and say it was probably adhering to a vision, because this

367
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,360
wasn't just about an experience on a phone, it was an experience on the tablet and on

368
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,360
the desktop.

369
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,160
And so you needed Qt and QML applications to really achieve that.

370
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,340
And an Android application looks really awkward in a desktop experience.

371
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:37,200
So it was probably more adherence to vision, but it might have been tunnel vision that

372
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,760
didn't benefit the platform.

373
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,320
Yeah, I suppose so.

374
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:46,400
And they talk about Unity, which is y-u-n-i-t.

375
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
So unit, unit.

376
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,880
I think it's supposed to be Unity, but it's a stupid name anyway.

377
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,940
And that's the fork of the desktop version of Unity.

378
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,840
And they had originally said they were going to be working with those guys.

379
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,240
Well, it doesn't look like much has happened, but they are acknowledging that, and they

380
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,680
are looking to work with them in the future, so that we'll get proper convergence.

381
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:12,380
I mean, it's remarkable to me how far they've come in a few short months compared to where

382
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,380
Canonical got with it.

383
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,620
I suppose they've got the building blocks there already, and they seem to be really

384
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,620
going for it.

385
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:23,580
And we've seen Firefox OS die, we've seen Sailfish not doing brilliantly, Tizen is kind

386
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,680
of ticking along.

387
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:33,120
And it's good to see a proper GNU slash Linux phone, rather than Android, which is becoming

388
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,320
more and more proprietary.

389
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,280
It'd just be nice to have an alternative.

390
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,620
And they say that we don't need to compete with Android because we're not a big company.

391
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,240
We don't have a huge staff to pay and all that stuff.

392
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,560
So they're just going to make something that is good, and hopefully people will come and

393
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
use it.

394
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,120
There's also about enabling older devices.

395
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,480
Your Nexus 5, for example, perfectly good phone, Google's not really interested in maintaining

396
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,740
that anymore.

397
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,600
Why not throw something like this on there and get another year or two of value out of

398
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
it?

399
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,640
Or even if you got another nine to 10 months of value out of it, you have a file browser,

400
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,120
you have a web browser, you have a terminal, it's now useful.

401
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,320
Well, I don't know, you still have got lineage available for it and a bunch of other ROMs,

402
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,520
so I'd probably be more inclined to do that if I needed to use this as a daily driver.

403
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,480
It's just your use case and your preference, I think, and it's just nice to have another

404
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,740
option for hardware that's still perfectly good, but the rest of the industry has moved

405
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,740
on from.

406
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,740
Yeah.

407
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,900
Yeah, I really do hope that UbiPorts continues.

408
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,640
I wasn't optimistic, whereas now they've proven me wrong on that.

409
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,680
So I really hope they continue to do so and drive it forward.

410
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,080
And I think sometimes it needs a big shock to shake things up, doesn't it?

411
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,160
And change the perspective on things.

412
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
And hopefully they're going to be the people to do it.

413
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,160
I agree.

414
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,560
Speaking of big shocks, the last release of FreeNAS was a big shock, and the project made

415
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,680
an about face and went back to version 9.

416
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,960
And now FreeNAS 11 has been released.

417
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,640
They've jumped right to FreeNAS 11, and it's based on FreeBSD 11, so it's nice to have

418
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,200
those versions match up.

419
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,320
Yeah, it's as if they've kind of said, well, let's just forget about 10 and move on to

420
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
11.

421
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,480
This looks like a hell of a release.

422
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,680
It's introducing a new beta version of their administration GUI, so you have the new GUI

423
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,920
and you have the old classic one, which is selectable at the login screen.

424
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,320
It's based on some AngularJS magic.

425
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,780
It looks great with live stats, but that's the least of the story here.

426
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,560
I'm very impressed with what the team has done.

427
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
It's really forward-looking.

428
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,920
So I think a couple of the big headline features, though, are the new Alert Services page, which

429
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,360
configures the systems to send critical alerts from FreeNAS to other applications like Slack

430
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,400
or PagerDuty, AWS's mailing system, HipChat, et cetera.

431
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,080
Mattermost is on the list.

432
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,720
That is a forward-looking feature.

433
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,160
I'm going to have to be characteristically negative here.

434
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:51,960
So should it not just be doing one thing really well, Unix style?

435
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,040
Should it not just be a really great network-attached storage distro?

436
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,200
Does it really need to have all these other features?

437
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,840
Well, they're standing on top of FreeBSD 11 release, which is using ZFS for the file system.

438
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,240
So that stuff is pretty rock solid.

439
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,560
That explains why when I went to download and install this, I noticed, hang on, it needs

440
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,880
eight gigabytes of RAM.

441
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,280
That's the kind of minimum spec for it.

442
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,680
And so I thought, I'm not going to chuck this on an old box, and I'm definitely not chucking

443
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,840
it on my main machine.

444
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,280
Yeah, ZFS can use some RAM, especially if you have a lot of storage.

445
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,160
It just seems overkill for my needs, at least.

446
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,900
I think this is much more aimed at enterprise, isn't it?

447
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,240
It's definitely getting there.

448
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,800
In fact, one of the new features that I thought was really impressive is it can now emulate

449
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,180
an S3 server, like an Amazon S3 distributed file system server.

450
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:46,880
It's using the open-source Meno project, which provides S3 storage on FreeNAS, so you can

451
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,960
then build your cloud, quote unquote, applications to talk S3, but communicate locally to your

452
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,960
FreeNAS server.

453
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,720
Oh, so that's going to potentially save you quite a lot of money then.

454
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,920
I think that's the idea.

455
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,140
And then you build for S3 in mind, you use it locally, and then if it comes time to publish

456
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,300
it on AWS, you don't have to really refactor much of your code.

457
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,100
Just sort of change the URLs and you're good to go.

458
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,100
That's my assumption.

459
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,680
Yeah, as I said, enterprise-level stuff, really.

460
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,040
This is not the kind of thing that you're going to download, chuck on an old box and

461
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,880
repurpose an old laptop.

462
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,600
I think they're trying to do both.

463
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,080
They're introducing features that make it easier to host things like Plex and other

464
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,320
home user features, but they're also introducing features that make it nicer for developers

465
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,800
and business deployments, which, why not?

466
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,440
If you have a rock-solid BSD foundation and a rock-solid file system, you really have

467
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,300
a lot of latitude there to build features on top of that.

468
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,920
I think you might be right.

469
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,000
It might begin to the point where it's too large, but then we have our friends over at

470
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,720
Open Media Vault that have a new release.

471
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,560
Yeah, why are we talking about a BSD thing on a Linux show?

472
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,280
Let's talk about something that's for proper Linux based on Debian.

473
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,080
So we've got this brand new release of Debian 9 and brand new release of Open Media Vault,

474
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,000
Open Media Vault 3 based on Debian 8.

475
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Oh.

476
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Yeah.

477
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,800
I think that whole transition to system D kind of took them by surprise.

478
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,880
So they had to adapt their backend to system D, which required a complete refactoring of

479
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,040
the backend of Open Media Vault, I believe.

480
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,320
Now I tried to install this today, right?

481
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,560
And you get through the NCurse's Debian installer and it gets to a point where it says you have

482
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,600
to pick the disk.

483
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,960
Now I didn't read it properly.

484
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,320
It said it's going to use the whole disk, but it did also say that you will confirm

485
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,720
at the next screen.

486
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,720
So I selected the disk that I wanted, pressed enter, and then suddenly it's installing and

487
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,200
destroyed all my partitions.

488
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
I was like, no.

489
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,560
Thankfully, that's what that machine is for.

490
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,720
It's a test machine.

491
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:46,920
And yeah, I lost my Solus and Kubuntu and a few other, I had a Zubuntu partition that

492
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:52,040
I was using somewhat in production, but there was nothing there that wasn't backed up, put

493
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
it that way.

494
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,760
But it was still kind of annoying that that happened.

495
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,160
And so then afterwards I was like, right, I'm not trying you out then.

496
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,240
So I haven't actually tried this release out, but it looks like they've improved things,

497
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,480
even if it is based on this ancient version of Debian now.

498
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,080
Yeah, but these releases of Debian are supported, like I said, for five years.

499
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,480
And the nice thing about this release is they've added support for extended FAT, which is going

500
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,400
to make the next feature even better.

501
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,160
They've also improved USB rotational storage device detection.

502
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,880
I mentioned that because that's the very system I'm thinking of using for Angela's OpenMedia

503
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:30,780
Vault to rotate a backup off site between buildings, and you can hook up devices and

504
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,780
move them around.

505
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,840
She's got an OpenMedia Vault 3 installation release candidate, so I've got to go over

506
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,160
to her house and update that for her.

507
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,840
You can't do it over SSH then.

508
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,920
Joe, then I would have to open up ports.

509
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,000
Come on, Joe.

510
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Come on.

511
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,540
You know, I could consider doing something like that because they've enabled SSH by default

512
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,440
in OpenMedia Vault 3.

513
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,760
Yeah, which is a bit of a questionable decision.

514
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,880
I know that the Raspberry Pi Foundation are being criticized for doing that on the Raspbian

515
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,720
distro.

516
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,040
It should be easily turn-on-able, if you know what I mean, but I'm a little bit hesitant

517
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,280
to say it should be enabled by default.

518
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,640
I tend to agree, especially because most users are oblivious to what it is, and those that

519
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,640
know what it is probably know that they need to turn it on.

520
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,600
Yeah, exactly.

521
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,600
Yeah.

522
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,880
Interestingly also, i386 has been dropped.

523
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:26,360
So it's 64-bit only, which is a trend that we've seen all over, Arch, Tails.

524
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,760
It's just the way of the future, isn't it?

525
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:34,880
If you've got 32-bit only hardware, then it's getting increasingly difficult to find a distro

526
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,720
to run on it, and eventually, they're just going to have to be thrown in the bin, unfortunately.

527
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,400
Maybe you won't be able to put it on that old rig after all.

528
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:49,320
Well, you can put it on an old rig, not an ancient one, because unless it's a netbook,

529
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,980
how old has it got to be to be 32-bit?

530
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,800
You're talking more than 10 years, aren't you?

531
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,480
Probably 12, 13 years, maybe more.

532
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,120
You know, Joe, my long years of experience have taught me not to go cheap on the systems

533
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,560
I never want to have to futz with.

534
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,440
So for Angela's setup, we put a NUC in there and then attached it to a hardware array of

535
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,880
disks that have built-in RAID array, and then Open Media Vault just connects to that, and

536
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,000
it's been just set it and forget it, and I don't have to mess with it because it's decent

537
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,540
enough hardware that'll run for a while.

538
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:21,280
There's really not many moving pieces in a NUC, and that storage array has redundancy.

539
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,320
The nice thing is, is I don't have to really worry about a power supply going out for a

540
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
long time.

541
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,520
I don't have to worry about the video card dying or something like that.

542
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,680
I say, if you can, put a slightly nicer machine in there so that way you don't have to futz

543
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,680
with it.

544
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,920
That's Chris's law of file servers.

545
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,920
Yeah, but at the same time, you should have other backups anyway, and this is a great

546
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,000
way to get into network storage.

547
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,080
Fair enough, and why not take advantage of hardware you have to learn?

548
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,080
I completely agree.

549
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,520
I mean, when you get to a point where you're ready to put something in like an appliance,

550
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
consider it.

551
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,200
You just love buying new toys, don't you?

552
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,280
That's what it boils down to.

553
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,680
