00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 154, recorded on September 13th, 2020.

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,920
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,920
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,640
And I'm standing here holding my Pixel 3 running Android 11, so I think that's where we start

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,640
this week.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,360
Yeah, after four developer previews and three betas, we've got the final release of Android

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,360
11.

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,880
And it's mostly on the Pixels to start with, with some betas for some OnePlus and Xiaomi

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,360
phones, but I'm dying to know, is it any different from 10?

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,360
It's pretty low key.

13
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,640
I think the most improvements can be seen in the notifications.

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,120
But even there, like with the new bubbles and notification stacks, I don't really use

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,120
notifications much on my chat apps, so I don't really take advantage of that.

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,720
And I don't know if Telegram is specifically taking advantage of it yet.

17
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,740
It's probably the most low key update I've ever gotten.

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:58,120
At the same time, nothing's really jumped out at me like I haven't had horrible battery

19
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,120
life.

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,720
In fact, if anything, within the last couple of updates, the standby time on my Pixel 3

21
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,160
has gotten outrageous, like four days maybe, just if I don't use it, because I have two

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
phones, right?

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
Because I'm that guy.

24
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,440
If I don't use it for like four days, it's still on.

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,080
It's low, but it's still going.

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,320
Runtime, actual use in runtime, I think that's not doing so good, but the Pixel 3 is getting

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,320
old.

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,920
As far as like under the hood stuff in Android 11 that's got my attention, Google introduced

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,200
a new out of memory adjuster design.

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,160
That's something that goes in there and helps clean up things when the system starts to

31
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,040
run low on RAM.

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,480
But one of the things they did in the new release is they adjusted it to avoid killing

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,280
a process if it would quote, result in a user perceptible interruption of service.

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,760
So that seems like they've made accommodations for low memory situations without theoretically

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,440
directly impacting the user.

36
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:53,200
I haven't hit those conditions yet, but I have in the past.

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,480
And when that happens, I'm hoping for a better experience now.

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,320
So did you update your Pixel 3 or did you go for a fresh installation?

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,440
Because you said last week that it was running pretty slow at the moment.

40
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,160
I did do an update and I'd say it's still running about the same.

41
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,440
Once it gets up and going, it's not that bad.

42
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,960
It's the having to get up and go that takes quite a while.

43
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,840
I have spent a little time trimming back some of my applications and I did some updates.

44
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,680
These new updates that are trickling in like often happens after a new Android release

45
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,200
and not everybody's on the same schedule.

46
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,640
As I go through some of that, it has gotten better, but no real difference overall.

47
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,400
Like ultimately it's still turn it on, set it down.

48
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,280
Also if I had it off for some reason, maybe to save like ultimately sometimes just to

49
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,040
save data or to make sure my two different phones aren't competing for location information

50
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,580
on some services, I just turn the phone off.

51
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:51,360
But if I do that, I have to try to plug it in when I first turn it on because that good

52
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,560
boot up process where all that stuff loads just drains the battery.

53
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,440
I think that's the case with any Android device, especially if you get a bunch of notifications

54
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,440
all the time.

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,320
They kind of stack up and it doesn't really know that you've already read those telegram

56
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,320
messages or emails or whatever on a different device and you just get bombarded.

57
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,160
I hear that's better on the iPhone side of things.

58
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
Yes.

59
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,400
I must synchronize what messages have been read because I never get old notifications

60
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,920
about old chats.

61
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,760
That just doesn't happen on the iOS side.

62
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,080
I'm not quite sure why that is, but I prefer that by quite a bit.

63
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,280
That being said, Android 11 has kind of taken some of the nicer things about the iPhone

64
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,240
10 generation gestures and incorporated them into 11.

65
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,620
Now that they've had some extra time to bake, I think they're in a pretty good place.

66
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,320
I think I might prefer the way it works on Android where I swipe up from the bottom and

67
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,280
I get my recent app tray and then I swipe more and there's all the apps.

68
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,160
I think I'm liking this.

69
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,880
They really got there in 10, but in 11 it just feels even more refined.

70
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,080
What about the new power menu stuff?

71
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,480
The fact that you can control smart home devices and stuff from that, that seems a weird place

72
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,480
to put it.

73
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,480
I like that it's a physical button though.

74
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,440
That is nice.

75
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,960
And now the button's starting to do a lot of things.

76
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,640
You double press the button on the Pixel device and it launches the camera.

77
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,040
You hold it and what you get now is a UI that looks very much like the HomeKit UI, if you're

78
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,360
familiar with that on iOS, or the Control Center pull down, where I've got power off

79
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
and restart.

80
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,200
I've got my Google Pay cards right here in the middle and then my top devices.

81
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,820
And it seems to, I'm not sure how it sorts them.

82
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,400
It's not alphabetical.

83
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,120
It seems to be like which ones are actually active and it puts the active devices at the

84
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,760
top of the list.

85
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,620
What's pretty neat about that is just with one press of the button, I can now turn off

86
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,280
all of the lights in the studio.

87
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,280
I like that.

88
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
All right.

89
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,440
And what about the Android Auto stuff?

90
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,440
That apparently has been improved.

91
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,720
Yeah, although I think the major improvement there, I had already been rocking because

92
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,880
I had a beta of Android Auto and my car doesn't support the wireless aspect, which is sort

93
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,160
of the nice thing to have at Android Auto in 11 is the wireless stuff and mine's wired.

94
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
Okay.

95
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,720
I think it's a worthwhile upgrade overall because there was really no negatives that

96
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,040
I could see and you get some new stuff.

97
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,360
But if you're wondering when to land on your device, dear listener, we do have a link to

98
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,120
XDAdevelopers.com, which has the Android 11 update tracker, it has the various manufacturers

99
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:18,460
and the either estimated date of arrival or the status at least.

100
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,620
And of course the Android open source project has now got the source code for Android 11.

101
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,040
So we're starting to see the very first custom ROMs become available.

102
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,280
So hopefully it won't be too long before we've got some stable alternatives that are based

103
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,000
on AOSP.

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,800
Also on the Android Go side of things, it's interesting to see some of the higher end

105
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,080
features coming to the Android Go edition phones, which you'll recall are the lower

106
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,980
tier Android devices with generally small amounts of RAM.

107
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,120
They're kind of seeing some nice quality of life improvements, including some of those

108
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,140
touch gestures I just mentioned, but also they seem to be preparing for more RAM in

109
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,760
these Go devices.

110
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,300
And you might wonder, in recent smartphone times, how common are low memory devices,

111
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,820
even the cheap ones?

112
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,880
Well XDA developers did a little digging and they say since September 3rd, 2019, the day

113
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,840
when Google released Android 10, there have been 367 new devices added to the Google Play

114
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,800
console device catalog that have at most, at most two gigs of RAM and either launched

115
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,080
with Android 10 or upgraded to it in the life cycle that was captured.

116
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,700
And if you include devices to the catalog after September 3rd, 2019, that either launched

117
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,760
with Android 9 Pie or haven't yet received an update to Android 10 because it's still

118
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:43,240
in the works, then that number jumps to almost 1500 that have launched since September 3rd,

119
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,240
2019.

120
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,600
So there's still a lot of devices being launched.

121
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,780
It's not insane numbers, but you're seeing devices come on, be registered and be completely

122
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,760
connected to the Google ecosystem still that have less than two gigs of RAM.

123
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,560
Well, there's a big market out there that isn't necessarily Europe or North America.

124
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,200
You know, it's a big world.

125
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Right.

126
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,320
And Android Go edition is targeted right at that big world.

127
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,820
And it seems like it's not that big of a compromise anymore to have a Go edition phone, faster

128
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:15,320
launching times, better encryption support and different types of touch gesture support

129
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
now.

130
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,840
I mean, it's getting pretty equivalent to standard Android.

131
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Yeah.

132
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,520
It makes me feel like I want Android Go on a more powerful phone.

133
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,880
They're not going to allow that by default, but it sounds like a pretty appealing prospect

134
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,880
to me.

135
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,800
Well, regardless if it's an Android Go device or a pixel running Android 11, they're all

136
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,520
powered by ARM chips.

137
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,220
And as we're recording this, it looks very likely that it will be announced soon that

138
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:46,840
SoftBank is set to sell their ARM holdings to Nvidia for around $40 billion and potentially

139
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,260
because the story is rapidly developing, it could happen the day you're listening to this

140
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,260
or shortly after.

141
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:56,240
Yeah, this has been rumored for what feels like months now, various people were going

142
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,400
to buy ARM, but then it seemed to trickle down to just Nvidia.

143
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,540
And now it seems like those details have been worked out.

144
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,400
And we're getting reports that have pretty firm now.

145
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,480
So I suppose we have to treat it as though it is happening.

146
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
It seems so.

147
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:20,220
The thing that has shifted over the last couple of months is they were sorting out this other

148
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,240
issue that was involved with some of the IP licensing.

149
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,200
It hinged on SoftBank ending a messy dispute between ARM and the leads of its China joint

150
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,120
venture.

151
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,320
And there was problems there.

152
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,020
In fact, there's still interesting rumors developing there.

153
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,480
But several people close to the SoftBank deal said that the matter was now, quote, resolved.

154
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,760
Although it's not quite clear what's happening with that China ARM and if it's continuing

155
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,000
on its own, that's some of the rumors right now.

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,740
But it seems that that messy dispute, as the Financial Times article puts it, is what was

157
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,740
holding it up.

158
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,740
And now that's resolved.

159
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,320
So they're going to proceed really early this week.

160
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,080
This comes at a pretty interesting time, given how Intel is struggling with their 7 nanometer.

161
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,720
That was after it took them years to sort out the 10 nanometer development process.

162
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,360
And we're still waiting for a complete shift to even 10 nanometer.

163
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,840
They're still selling some CPUs that are 14 nanometer.

164
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:17,000
And the reason why this matters, these nanometers, is because it's an indicator of Intel's manufacturing

165
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,240
capability and capacity.

166
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,700
They used to be the king.

167
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,840
They were the ones that constantly were breaking Moore's Law.

168
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,240
And now they can't get their process down.

169
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
They can't get the results that they need.

170
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,620
So yeah, I think it is interesting.

171
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,840
Not only that timing, while Intel's on the ropes, and has been for a while now, for years

172
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,200
now, I think you could say.

173
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,680
But also, you can't ignore the fact that Apple just announced they're transitioning their

174
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:46,540
entire Mac line to a series of custom in-house built ARM-based CPUs, which by all accounts

175
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,360
are going to be very high performance, will probably trickle down into their mobile line

176
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
as well.

177
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:54,880
And it seems like they've just bet the next 20 years on ARM over there at Apple.

178
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,480
And the other side there is Apple and Nvidia don't get along.

179
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,280
They have bad blood.

180
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:06,840
This comes not too long after SoftBank bought ARM in the first place for 32 billion.

181
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,880
So they're going to make a pretty tidy profit here if this 40 billion figure turns out to

182
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
be true.

183
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,880
Right.

184
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,640
And there has to be a calculus there by Nvidia.

185
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,840
This has to be a plan to transform their entire product lineup.

186
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,500
When you think of Nvidia chips right now, you think of chips that are largely focused

187
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,280
at the high end of the market, powerful graphics processors, or crazy fast ARM CPUs designed

188
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,780
for machine learning inside a car dashboard, things that scientific research might use

189
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,520
or other things.

190
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:43,680
But this deal, once they own ARM holdings, kind of puts them in the whole range of the

191
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,680
market.

192
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,640
Not just the high end now, but also those Android Go devices we talked about.

193
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,540
And all of those 5G towers that have ARM controllers and ARM processors in the actual antennas

194
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,300
that help do the beamforming.

195
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:02,640
And not to mention just the entire swath of devices in the IoT category and even set top

196
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,380
boxes that all use ARM CPUs that Nvidia was never in those markets.

197
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,380
And now they will be.

198
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:14,080
Yeah, it means they'll be in pretty much all of the hardware markets from thermostats and

199
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,100
IoT devices through to the servers that are crunching the numbers on them.

200
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,840
And then also the GPUs that are crunching the machine learning stuff.

201
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,980
It feels like they're just going to be in the market completely top to bottom now.

202
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,680
It seems like every time something of this scale happens, which we have to acknowledge

203
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,920
as we record has not happened yet, but seems lined up.

204
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,560
When something of this scale does happen, there tends to be a reaction.

205
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,640
And you do wonder if that reaction, I mean, maybe wonder, I hope, maybe is the better

206
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,840
way to put it, that that reaction is an investment in RISC-V.

207
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,760
Or if I could wave a magic wand, honestly, it would be an investment in open power PC.

208
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,320
Because we've already got workstations and desktops with that architecture ready to go

209
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,160
with PCI Express slots running Linux, like it's really close.

210
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,840
It just needs to close that 10% gap and have an investment to get the CPU down a bit.

211
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:15,840
I feel like there's a potential, maybe possible hope that that could happen, that one of those

212
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,120
platforms sees an investment from this.

213
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
You're a dreamer, Chris.

214
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
You're a dreamer.

215
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,040
Wouldn't it be nice though?

216
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,040
It would be nice.

217
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,640
And I think that we will have some competition there because it does look like RISC-V is

218
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
coming along.

219
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,000
And I think we are going to see much more powerful RISC-V boards over the next year

220
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
or so.

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,240
But as for how much competition they will give Nvidia an arm, I can't see it being huge.

222
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,520
They'll find a niche and it will do well.

223
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,600
But it just seems like Nvidia now have just got it all sewn up to me.

224
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,600
I agree.

225
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,920
Although I'd be happy if we could just get it in the professional workstation and laptop

226
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
market.

227
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,740
Maybe a few servers, maybe a couple of little small boards.

228
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,740
That's all I'm asking.

229
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,600
Well, give it a few years and you never know.

230
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,040
Linux.ting.com, get $25 off a cell phone bill at linux.ting.com.

231
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,720
With Ting, there's no contracts, no commitments.

232
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,280
So you can try Ting for a month with no strings attached.

233
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,560
The average Ting bill is just $23 a month per phone.

234
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,560
So you'll get a month of free service when you go to linux.ting.com and use our $25 promo

235
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
code.

236
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,960
And while you're there, see if your device is already compatible because it's pretty

237
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,500
straightforward to switch over if it is.

238
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,960
And Ting offers LTE coverage on three nationwide networks.

239
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,440
The one that I'm using right now is Verizon Wireless and it's amazing as a backup.

240
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,800
I have to say Verizon Wireless has one of the best networks and it's great to see Ting

241
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,040
work with them on that.

242
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,340
But there's two other networks to pick from as well.

243
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,680
So you just check the coverage and choose the one that works best.

244
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,440
If you're often around Wi-Fi, why are you paying for a monthly set of data?

245
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,080
With Ting, you just pay for the talk, the text, and the data that you actually use each

246
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,080
month.

247
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,120
If you use less, you pay less.

248
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,240
If you're working from home, you don't need to be paying for a data connection you're

249
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,400
not using very often, especially if you know how to sync podcasts or sync your music before

250
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
you hit the road.

251
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
You can even save more data.

252
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,200
Ting is not a prepaid cell phone company.

253
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,500
At the end of the month, you're billed for the talk, the text, and the data you use.

254
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,320
So go to linux.ting.com.

255
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,440
Everything's laid out, explained.

256
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,280
You can check to see if your device is compatible or grab a brand new device straight from Ting

257
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,920
or just get a SIM card.

258
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,680
Go to linux.ting.com.

259
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,120
Let's talk about Mozilla again then.

260
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:36,200
And this week they launched what they're calling a pilot program to give developers a way to

261
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,520
promote their add-ons on addons.mozilla.org.

262
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,980
Well this is how we're going to watch Mozilla die, unfortunately.

263
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,980
And I don't say that with any levity.

264
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,660
This really is depressing to read.

265
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,200
And part of it is just my gut instinct.

266
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,440
I don't normally lead with that on Linux Action News.

267
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,900
I try to lead with the facts first.

268
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:58,400
But in this case, we've been watching really what is a long string of stories that are

269
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:05,040
linking together that demonstrate a collapse of direction for Mozilla and an inability

270
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,160
to execute that has cost over 200 people their very valuable jobs.

271
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:17,460
And when I read this, what I see is a pathway to monetizing add-ons.

272
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,960
And there's a lot of things I don't like about that.

273
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,600
But I don't even like the way they're approaching it.

274
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,240
I don't like the way they even speak about it.

275
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,220
It's stuffed with corporate acronyms, their own internal acronyms that they're now exposing

276
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,440
to the public, and what appears to be essentially a plan to limit what kind of made Firefox

277
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,000
great and instead try to monetize that strategy.

278
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I think you could say I'm being cynical here because the way they talk about it is this

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,880
is going to support developers.

280
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,800
That's why they're creating this program in the first place, they say.

281
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,700
They'll have tiers where they can have unverified and manually reviewed extensions.

282
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,860
So there is some story for people that don't want to get involved in this process.

283
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,800
But when you get into the paid services, you get things like a verified batch on your extension,

284
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,160
which says that it's been verified by Mozilla.

285
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,840
You also can choose to buy sponsored placement on the Mozilla add-ons front page, sort of

286
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:16,680
like an app store looking front page with your app placed right above the most popular

287
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
add-ons.

288
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,680
All right.

289
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Let me play devil's advocate then.

290
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,160
And to make some non-Google revenue, this is surely a reasonable way to do it.

291
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,160
I hope so.

292
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,760
I hope it doesn't end up limiting who can participate in the add-on ecosystem and ultimately

293
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:35,280
lead to just less and less interesting Firefox add-ons.

294
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,280
We'll see.

295
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,480
I guess only time will tell us with this particular one.

296
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,760
But my gut read on this is being informed by like two or three signals.

297
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:50,360
The first and maybe the most predominant signal is this has got very little coverage.

298
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,800
Hardly any tech outlet is covering this.

299
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,000
No one seems to care.

300
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,580
That's a huge red flag for Mozilla.

301
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,280
Number two, I will be honest, one of the things that has been an indicator for me for a while

302
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:07,040
with Mozilla is how they speak to the world and the language they choose to use, the way

303
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:11,800
they choose to dress it up instead of speaking plainly and directly is a warning flag to

304
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
me.

305
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,720
And the way that this thing is just packed full of acronyms, their own acronyms like

306
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,440
AMO for the Mozilla add-on store, I'm not a fan of that.

307
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:26,280
These things all kind of add up to kind of give me a bad read on this and I guess I'm

308
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,720
combining that with their history so far and it just doesn't seem like they're trending

309
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,000
in the right direction.

310
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,160
If this has got a lot of interest, if there was some reaction, even negative reaction,

311
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,360
that would be a different signal.

312
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,120
But you're saying that they're just not relevant enough for the non-open source tech press

313
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,760
to care about them.

314
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,560
Yeah, I think that's kind of it.

315
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,520
And I think you could say it feels like they've slipped out of interest from the mainstream

316
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,520
press.

317
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,520
Nobody's really writing about this stuff.

318
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,320
No one's really writing about many things regarding Mozilla or Firefox right now or

319
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,320
Thunderbird.

320
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,480
Thunderbird's getting very little coverage at the moment.

321
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,560
I think the interest is dropping off.

322
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,480
Unfortunately, this is what kind of begins that slide into irrelevancy.

323
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,480
But what else could they do except try and look for areas they can make some money?

324
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:19,700
And with this particular case, to make those extensions verified, they have to go through

325
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,740
a process of manual verification and that costs money.

326
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:29,800
And so it's not unreasonable for them to ask for money from developers to pay the people

327
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,920
whose job it is to verify them.

328
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:36,960
I'd probably be willing to pay for a decent add-on if it truly improved my workflow.

329
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,200
This is something that happens on the Apple platform.

330
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,320
You can charge for Safari extensions, which sometimes seems ludicrous, for like $4 for

331
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,760
a browser extension.

332
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,640
So it better be worth it.

333
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,960
I don't see that likely playing out here.

334
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,960
I don't see that happening.

335
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,400
But like I said, time will tell.

336
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
I'm hopeful.

337
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,840
The lack of interest and traction doesn't seem to be a solid indicator that's going

338
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,520
to go that direction.

339
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,400
But I'll take the hopeful route with you, Joe.

340
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
You know, you're such an optimist.

341
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,240
I'm known for my optimism, you know.

342
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,080
So this next story is either going to read like a new tool in the toolbox or the next

343
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,960
step in a corporate takeover of Linux and free software as we know it.

344
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,980
Microsoft has seen fit to add file system access to WSL2, which I suppose could be pretty

345
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,320
damn handy on systems that have multiple OSs installed.

346
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:33,120
Yeah, so if you're dual booting Linux and Windows, specifically on two separate physical

347
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,040
disks at the moment, but we'll see where this goes in the future, then you will be able

348
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:45,140
to access your Linux disk via Windows subsystem for Linux 2 with a simple mount command.

349
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,520
And then it will show up right there in Windows Explorer, or whatever they're calling the

350
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,220
file manager these days.

351
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,300
This is the opposite of what I and I know a lot of our audience probably does is I have

352
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,920
Windows in a VM, like a VHD file.

353
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,600
And there is, it's possible when I need to, to actually boot from that.

354
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,680
But typically, I'm just using Linux.

355
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,720
And here's kind of the opposite happening there.

356
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,160
Like you said, like you said, though, there is that limitation.

357
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:12,180
So just to put this concretely, it means that it is not possible to use WSL to mount a partition

358
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,640
on a boot device, because that device is already attached to Windows.

359
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,440
So if you are dual booting from the same disk, that disk is already in use.

360
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,920
And the other limitation that kind of combines with this is it's a whole disk mount right

361
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
now.

362
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,360
It's not like one particular partition on that disk, it's you kind of expose the entire

363
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,560
thing to the subsystem, which is great, kind of a cool feature.

364
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,600
But in some scenarios can be a limitation that you need to be aware of.

365
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:44,360
Yeah, but if you've got one big spinning Rust disk with all your data sets on it or something,

366
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,240
then I could see that being very useful.

367
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,260
The other thing that's interesting to see is Microsoft taking the effort to backport

368
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,560
WSL to, to older versions of Windows 10, the older builds that are run like a corporate

369
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:59,240
environments that initially that didn't seem like was going to happen is like this build

370
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:06,000
and forward gets the new fancy WSL and the older builds are going to stick with WSL one.

371
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,960
But it looks like via Windows update mechanisms over time, those older enterprise builds are

372
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,360
also going to get the new WSL to hotness.

373
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,000
Now of course, you've been able to mount Linux file systems like ext4 in Windows for quite

374
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,440
some time using third party tools.

375
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,880
But now we're talking built into Windows, not having to install something else.

376
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,320
And I think they'll get over that whole disk problem soon enough.

377
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,400
I can't see them not being able to find a workaround for that.

378
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,360
And if it's in Windows, then it's passed all of the compliance checks and everything.

379
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,520
You're not having to have a separate compliance form and all the rest of it for that bit of

380
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,880
software that you're using to mount your Linux file systems, which may or may not pass compliance.

381
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,880
And that's what we're talking about here.

382
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,440
We're talking about the corporate environment.

383
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
Yeah.

384
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
We're talking about that.

385
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,080
Not only is this built in, but it's whatever file system, the Linux kernel that they're

386
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,480
using WSL to has support for, which could also include things like XFS and other really

387
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,900
great file systems.

388
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,960
So that's nice.

389
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,640
But the other aspect that strikes me here is I picture that younger version of me that

390
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,640
was struggling to run desktop Linux, like now I've used desktop Linux for so long that

391
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,640
I take it for granted that I can use desktop Linux.

392
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,240
But there was absolutely a time.

393
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,960
I was struggling to integrate into a corporate environment and I had to have really slow,

394
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,960
crappy Windows VMs or as I got more established, I got a separate Windows PC, but it was embarrassing

395
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,600
because the Linux guy had to have a Windows machine and the guys would always razz me

396
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
about that.

397
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,480
And I was trying out all kinds of crazy distributions to try to get this to work.

398
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,040
And now it's right here, all nice and tidy.

399
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,520
I could run Linux, but if I had to do something under Windows, I could reboot, I'd have those

400
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Windows tools.

401
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Like the classic one for me back in the day was the VMware ESX management console.

402
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:03,280
And if I need to get access to the stuff that's on my primary workstation OS, I have a pretty

403
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,280
good terminal.

404
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,520
I have a Linux user land and I can mount that drive now.

405
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,720
I just think about that and that would have been a great tool that would have made things

406
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,720
so much smoother.

407
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:17,260
I would not have been experimenting with crazy file system drivers that caused Windows to

408
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,720
blue screen dozens of times.

409
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,800
But there's all these things you had to do to try to get this to work.

410
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,880
So I think it is actually kind of significant in that sense.

411
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,320
And that's how I would employ something like this.

412
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,600
I can now get to my Linux stuff, which is my primary environment when I need to go into

413
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,660
Windows to solve a problem.

414
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,660
That's pretty handy.

415
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:41,120
Well, if you're going for a proper bare metal Ubuntu installation in the corporate environment,

416
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,080
good news because Canonical is adding active directory support to the Ubiquiti installer

417
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,880
for 2010.

418
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,140
Snuck just in under the wire, 2010 will support enabling active directory for logins right

419
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,440
there in the installer.

420
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,960
This is fantastic to see.

421
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,660
OpenSUSE makes this pretty easy.

422
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,680
And Fedora, I was just installing Fedora 33 last week and right there is a button to join

423
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
to an active directory.

424
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,360
This is becoming table stakes for workstation OSs.

425
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,600
It's great to see Canonical add this.

426
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,760
The primary reason you like to see something like this is not only can you then integrate

427
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:17,920
it into an installation script, which makes automated deployments easier, but also you

428
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,640
have to solve this yourself.

429
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,640
And there's like three or four different ways to solve this problem.

430
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,700
And it's nice just to have a vendor supported mechanism.

431
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,760
And then this eventually will graduate its way into an LTS release, which then eventually

432
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,880
ends up shipping on actual hardware, which means you buy a laptop from Dell or HP or

433
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,680
Lenovo running Ubuntu and right out of the box, that thing can connect to your active

434
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,760
directory.

435
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,760
And I absolutely have people in mind that are deep into the Microsoft ecosystem, you

436
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,360
know, they're businesses that have been around for more than a minute.

437
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,000
And so they've invested heavily in an on-premises login system and on-premises file sharing

438
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,240
and on-premises shared printing.

439
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,920
And a lot of times, especially in the Pacific Northwest from the nineties forward, Microsoft

440
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:05,300
was the go-to solution and they've been with it now for years.

441
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
They're not switching.

442
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
They're just not.

443
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,640
The business will run that suite until the business ends and they're perfectly happy

444
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,800
with it, but they won't even consider hardware that doesn't tie in with their active directory.

445
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,860
It's just not even an option.

446
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,280
From mobile to all other little devices like their key card system they have for unlocking

447
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,020
their doors, all of it connects into AD.

448
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,680
Even cloud infrastructure services they have with third-party vendors actually use their

449
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,920
AD credentials to authenticate their staff and stuff.

450
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,440
I mean, they're deep into it.

451
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,360
Because something like this means that this is a real possibility and as soon as this

452
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,640
starts shipping, I have somebody I'm going to recommend it to and I think they're going

453
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,600
to give their first Linux desktop a go because they got a laptop sitting ready for it.

454
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,000
They're just not going to do it unless it works with active directory and the kind of

455
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,160
like guides that are available online that I sent him, it just did not work.

456
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
He just didn't take it.

457
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,360
He just, no, I'm not doing it.

458
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,560
I'm not having this.

459
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,040
You realize this is like two clicks in Windows, he says.

460
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Yeah.

461
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,440
And that's what it's going to be now, which is great.

462
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
Yeah.

463
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
Right there at the installation too.

464
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,200
So when, I mean, in theory, right after the first boot, you just log in with your network

465
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
credentials.

466
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,200
Yeah.

467
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,600
Well, you'll have to let us know how you get on with that, whether you manage to convert

468
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
him.

469
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
Well, you know us, Joe.

470
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,400
We're going to follow that and all the other stories that develop in the Linux and open

471
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
source world.

472
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,800
So be sure you go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe.

473
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,080
Make sure your subscription is fresh so that way you get every new episode that comes out.

474
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,360
And you can go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

475
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,360
And here's a pro tip.

476
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,800
If you haven't yet, go subscribe to the All Jupiter Broadcasting Shows feed, either from

477
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:41,080
our main website or just search in your podcast catcher of choice because when we do release

478
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,720
new stuff that may or may not be in the works, that's where it'll land first.

479
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,000
And also spread the word that we're back.

480
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,440
Did you know the number one source of actual marketing for podcasts is just word of mouth?

481
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,500
Your recommendation.

482
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,200
If you know someone who would like the show, share it with them.

483
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,040
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.
