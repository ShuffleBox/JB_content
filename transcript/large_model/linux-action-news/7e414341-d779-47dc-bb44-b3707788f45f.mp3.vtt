Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.280 --> 00:20.520
This is episode 72, recorded on September 23rd, 2018.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.520
I'm Joe.

00:21.520 --> 00:22.520
And I'm Wes.

00:22.520 --> 00:23.520
Hello, Wes.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.760
Thank you for joining me again.

00:24.760 --> 00:28.000
Chris might be back next week, we'll have to see, but I'll have to put up with you in

00:28.000 --> 00:29.000
the meantime.

00:29.000 --> 00:32.640
So let's start with some news from Mozilla.

00:32.640 --> 00:39.340
They have released Firefox Reality 1.0, which is their virtual reality browser.

00:39.340 --> 00:44.400
You can get it today for the HTC Vive, Oculus, or a Daydream headset.

00:44.400 --> 00:47.640
Now unfortunately, I don't own any of those, do you?

00:47.640 --> 00:54.240
I have one of the little off-market rebranded headsets, so I did install and give it a go.

00:54.240 --> 00:58.720
Wasn't a great experience for me because my hardware was so bad, but it's an intriguing

00:58.720 --> 00:59.720
concept.

00:59.720 --> 01:00.720
It is intriguing.

01:00.720 --> 01:05.240
And I think that it shows that Mozilla don't want to be left behind on this one.

01:05.240 --> 01:10.760
They were left behind on the mobile market to quite a large extent, certainly with Firefox

01:10.760 --> 01:12.440
OS, which never really took off.

01:12.440 --> 01:19.640
Okay, it's kind of carrying on as KaiOS, but it shows that they are taking this VR thing

01:19.640 --> 01:20.640
seriously.

01:20.640 --> 01:25.400
And it might be a fad, it might not be a fad, it might be the future, who knows?

01:25.400 --> 01:28.080
And I think that they have to kind of do this, don't they?

01:28.080 --> 01:31.200
They have to be there at the beginning of it.

01:31.200 --> 01:35.200
Yeah, if you're not at the stage where it feels like, well, maybe this is a risky bet,

01:35.200 --> 01:39.080
who knows if this is going to take off any time soon, well, then you're probably joined

01:39.080 --> 01:40.080
too late.

01:40.080 --> 01:46.000
And right now, the VR space is pretty dominated by some heavy, large corporation-like entities.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.640
It's nice to see Mozilla getting an open source foot in the door early.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.760
It's a little bit bare bones at this stage, though, isn't it?

01:51.760 --> 01:55.800
There's no bookmarks, for example, which, does that really matter?

01:55.800 --> 01:56.800
Does anyone use bookmarks?

01:56.800 --> 02:01.360
Okay, I use bookmarks quite a lot, but I hear that some people don't, but that is coming

02:01.360 --> 02:03.080
soon, hopefully.

02:03.080 --> 02:07.720
It looks like some of this work has been possible thanks to their new GeckoView component.

02:07.720 --> 02:12.560
We talked a little about that last week in LAN Episode 71, and that means they haven't

02:12.560 --> 02:15.000
had to redo a bunch of labor to create this.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.780
Instead, there's a common core that they can share with Firefox Focus and some of the other

02:18.780 --> 02:22.640
Firefox technologies that they already have on these platforms.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.920
And there is a privacy mode as well, isn't there?

02:24.920 --> 02:27.080
I wonder what that might be used for.

02:27.080 --> 02:31.000
I can think of quite a few things, Joe.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Yes.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.160
Well, let's move on.

02:34.160 --> 02:37.400
Let's talk about AMP, accelerated mobile pages.

02:37.400 --> 02:43.280
Now, Google has come in for a lot of criticism regarding AMP, including from me, about how

02:43.280 --> 02:51.540
they have had quite a tight control over it and are basically forcing the mobile web onto

02:51.540 --> 02:54.960
their servers and onto their standards.

02:54.960 --> 03:00.200
They have always maintained that it is open source and supposedly open standards, but

03:00.200 --> 03:04.160
the governance model was very much top down from Google.

03:04.160 --> 03:09.360
Well, now they have decided that they're going to go for a new governance model.

03:09.360 --> 03:15.400
They say they want this new model to explicitly give a voice to all constituents of the community,

03:15.400 --> 03:18.720
including those who cannot contribute code themselves, such as end users.

03:18.720 --> 03:22.240
Yeah, they certainly want to try and make it more inclusive.

03:22.240 --> 03:26.000
I'm not sure about individuals, but they certainly want more companies to get involved with this

03:26.000 --> 03:30.160
so that it is not just a purely Google project.

03:30.160 --> 03:33.120
At least that's the impression they want to give here.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.340
Sounds like a couple reasonably sized players have signed on.

03:36.340 --> 03:39.440
People like Washington Post, eBay, and Cloudflare.

03:39.440 --> 03:45.280
That's a good mix of e-commerce sites, publishers, and then actual hosting platforms.

03:45.280 --> 03:49.080
One of the biggest problems though has been so far, Google's really the only one that

03:49.080 --> 03:53.320
serves a big AMP cache, so all of your AMP pages come from Google.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.160
Will any of these other sites step in?

03:55.160 --> 03:58.960
Cloudflare looks like one that could be a possibility, but I don't know, is two of the

03:58.960 --> 04:01.960
biggest providers really that much more diversity?

04:01.960 --> 04:07.480
Well, it's certainly a good start and Cloudflare, I would say, almost certainly have the resources

04:07.480 --> 04:15.200
to do this, but I would like to see it being much less centralized because at the moment,

04:15.200 --> 04:19.520
almost all AMP traffic goes through Google servers and therefore they have all the metrics

04:19.520 --> 04:22.280
on that, all the data.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.640
The thing is that the underlying technology is really good.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.520
It's taking the mobile web back to basics.

04:28.520 --> 04:33.600
It's stripping out a lot of the stuff that you don't need and making it super fast.

04:33.600 --> 04:37.040
Everyone agrees that that is a good idea.

04:37.040 --> 04:42.160
It's just the implementation that has been the problem so far and potentially with this

04:42.160 --> 04:47.400
new governance model, getting more companies and people involved with it, we might get

04:47.400 --> 04:51.920
to the stage where it's not all being funneled through Google's servers, but then you do

04:51.920 --> 04:55.520
have to ask what's in it for Google at that point.

04:55.520 --> 05:00.200
How will this work if there is a big federated list of various caches you can use?

05:00.200 --> 05:05.080
How do you pick who has control of that marketplace and why?

05:05.080 --> 05:10.280
Are they going to be given equal footing on the Google search list because that's really

05:10.280 --> 05:12.240
where all the traffic is driven from?

05:12.240 --> 05:16.000
Right, and that's been one of the main things that made some publishing platforms feel like

05:16.000 --> 05:19.520
they've really been pushed into supporting AMP, even though they do have such a loss

05:19.520 --> 05:20.700
of control.

05:20.700 --> 05:24.880
It's also good to see that they are taking inspiration from the likes of Node.js and

05:24.880 --> 05:30.240
Kubernetes and looking at forming a foundation here, which really would separate it out from

05:30.240 --> 05:31.240
Google.

05:31.240 --> 05:32.920
All the verbiage sounds right to me.

05:32.920 --> 05:36.240
I think there's some good principles here and everything they're saying is the way I

05:36.240 --> 05:39.340
would want to see an open source project run.

05:39.340 --> 05:42.580
Now there will be an AMP contributor summit next week.

05:42.580 --> 05:46.080
Maybe there we will start to see, is there really interest from the broader community?

05:46.080 --> 05:48.000
Is AMP a technology that can be saved?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.280
Well, fingers crossed.

05:50.280 --> 05:54.840
Another technology that originally came from mobile, the Ubuntu phone, Ubuntu Touch, was

05:54.840 --> 05:59.720
MIR, and that is not dead, contrary to popular belief.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.840
It's actually reached a 1.0.0 release this week.

06:02.840 --> 06:06.720
1.0 is a big deal for just about any open source project.

06:06.720 --> 06:11.360
The first blush, I was a little confused about just what was so important about this release.

06:11.360 --> 06:15.960
I really think it's XDG shell support being stable.

06:15.960 --> 06:19.580
You can build on that, you can depend on it, and really that means you can tie into the

06:19.580 --> 06:22.360
Wayland world and build on top of MIR.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.360
Well, exactly.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.460
That's the exciting thing here.

06:25.460 --> 06:31.320
It's potentially going to allow a lot of other projects to hook into Wayland.

06:31.320 --> 06:37.260
And as we know, the X server is just, it's so old, there's so many security issues, Wayland

06:37.260 --> 06:38.520
is the future.

06:38.520 --> 06:43.520
It is the present for a lot of people on Fedora, for example, and we know that Ubuntu tried

06:43.520 --> 06:49.540
it with the 17.10 release, but then reverted back to X for the LTS.

06:49.540 --> 06:56.080
And I got some messages from unofficial canonical PR man, Martin Winpress, about this.

06:56.080 --> 07:01.680
And he told me that the Marte desktop are planning to use this to offer Wayland support.

07:01.680 --> 07:06.080
And he told me to expect more about that in the coming weeks.

07:06.080 --> 07:12.000
And at the canonical sprint that they've just had in Belgium this week, a minimal Marte

07:12.000 --> 07:16.320
shell was demoed using this MIR and Wayland combination.

07:16.320 --> 07:20.840
And he also told me that potentially LXQt might be going down the same route, although

07:20.840 --> 07:25.480
I did ask someone in that community and he was very much silent, refused to answer on

07:25.480 --> 07:26.480
that.

07:26.480 --> 07:32.680
So I think they're still deciding, but it goes to show that this technology could potentially

07:32.680 --> 07:39.600
open the door to Wayland for a lot of other desktop environments and people making distros.

07:39.600 --> 07:44.560
I think that's been one difficulty moving past X is it's just been such an entrenched

07:44.560 --> 07:45.800
ecosystem.

07:45.800 --> 07:50.100
And while Wayland has a lot of neat technology baked into it, it just hasn't necessarily

07:50.100 --> 07:53.800
been the right abstraction level for a lot of existing platforms.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.800
Now the big guys, Gnome and Plasma, not a big deal.

07:56.800 --> 08:01.200
They've implemented their own extensions and made it work, but we haven't seen the same

08:01.200 --> 08:05.760
kind of proliferation of various desktop options that we've had in the good old days.

08:05.760 --> 08:12.000
As they put it, MIR has both sensible default behavior and a simple yet powerful API.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.240
So that sounds like just about the best building block I could hope for.

08:15.240 --> 08:18.140
Do you think it's a little bit early for a 1.0 though?

08:18.140 --> 08:21.080
Is that just a statement from them saying that it's not dead?

08:21.080 --> 08:25.680
It does seem like it is a little bit of a statement and just having that Wayland extension

08:25.680 --> 08:26.680
support.

08:26.680 --> 08:30.280
It seems like this is a signal to the community that, hey, look, we still exist and we're

08:30.280 --> 08:32.160
something that you should think about using.

08:32.160 --> 08:36.480
Well, something that you shouldn't still be using at least not for much longer is Ubuntu

08:36.480 --> 08:37.480
14.04.

08:37.480 --> 08:42.840
But if you are, don't worry because you can pay Canonical or you will be able to pay Canonical

08:42.840 --> 08:45.960
for extended maintenance.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.760
And this isn't a real surprise, is it?

08:47.760 --> 08:53.000
We saw this with 12.04 and now, again, we're seeing it with 14.04.

08:53.000 --> 08:58.280
No doubt we'll see it with 16.04, but it's of note because it shows that that obviously

08:58.280 --> 09:00.200
went well for them, 12.04.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.440
It must have paid for itself at least.

09:03.440 --> 09:09.800
And it shows that Canonical are very serious about being a serious enterprise player and

09:09.800 --> 09:14.520
being able to compete with the likes of Red Hat for the huge long-term support that they

09:14.520 --> 09:15.520
offer.

09:15.520 --> 09:20.920
Clearly, this is marketed at big, slow-moving enterprises who do want to remain in compliance,

09:20.920 --> 09:26.120
but you know, it's just a lot of work to upgrade your distro sometimes, guys, so why not spend

09:26.120 --> 09:27.120
a little more money?

09:27.120 --> 09:29.280
It looks like it is part of Ubuntu Advantage.

09:29.280 --> 09:34.760
So if you're already paying for that service, well, most plans include ESM already.

09:34.760 --> 09:40.880
Or if you want to buy in quantities of a thousand machines or above, it's $50 per node per year.

09:40.880 --> 09:44.840
Which is not a great deal of money compared to the money that you would spend upgrading

09:44.840 --> 09:45.840
it.

09:45.840 --> 09:52.680
I mean, most of us think, okay, one server or whatever, going from 12.04 to 14.04 or

09:52.680 --> 09:55.360
14 to 16, it's not a huge issue.

09:55.360 --> 09:59.640
But if you've got a lot of machines or if you're running certain applications which

09:59.640 --> 10:04.460
are just going to break, there's a lot of slow-moving infrastructure out there that

10:04.460 --> 10:06.960
just cannot upgrade.

10:06.960 --> 10:12.800
And so that's why you end up with these Red Hat deployments that are 10 years old.

10:12.800 --> 10:18.640
And if Canonical are really serious about IPIing or potentially selling the company,

10:18.640 --> 10:22.080
then they need to be competitive with the likes of Red Hat.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.400
And so here we are.

10:24.400 --> 10:31.480
It's interesting to note that they say, contact Canonical sales to start planning for Ubuntu

10:31.480 --> 10:36.040
14.04 end of life or talk about your Ubuntu 12.04 estate.

10:36.040 --> 10:42.840
Because when they announced the 12.04 extended maintenance, they said that it would be good

10:42.840 --> 10:48.240
through April 2019, they didn't say to April.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.680
It's kind of confusing language.

10:49.680 --> 10:54.120
They're a UK-based company mostly, and that's kind of an American way to put it.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.080
So does that mean it was going to end then?

10:56.080 --> 10:57.080
It looks like it isn't.

10:57.080 --> 11:02.040
It looks like they're going to continue to support 12.04 potentially, which is kind of

11:02.040 --> 11:03.280
a big deal, isn't it?

11:03.280 --> 11:07.000
It's a long, long time that they will have been supporting it.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Yeah, you're right.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
It is confusing.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.140
And over on their Advantage page, it says ongoing security fixes for the kernel and

11:13.140 --> 11:15.920
essential packages through April 2019.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.720
But who knows quite what's going on?

11:17.720 --> 11:21.360
I'm sure if you're a customer, they'll provide you a little more details.

11:21.360 --> 11:26.860
It does seem pretty pragmatic to me because, well, unfortunately, this is going to happen.

11:26.860 --> 11:29.440
People are going to take time to move off these distros.

11:29.440 --> 11:32.200
And a lot of them will just be unpatched and won't have this access.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.400
Now, if you're a big enough customer to get it, that just means there's less machines

11:35.400 --> 11:37.360
out there running without patches.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.360
And that makes me smile.

11:38.360 --> 11:41.960
Yeah, it's definitely a good thing, but it's not the only news coming out of Canonical

11:41.960 --> 11:42.960
this week.

11:42.960 --> 11:48.640
There was a blog post by Will Cook, who I know from Late Night Linux, about running

11:48.640 --> 11:53.760
Ubuntu VMs on Windows and how that has been made much, much easier.

11:53.760 --> 11:57.840
It looks like they've done some digging in the Ubuntu report data and found out that

11:57.840 --> 12:00.800
actually a lot of people are using Ubuntu as a virtual machine.

12:00.800 --> 12:04.240
Now that's probably not a huge surprise.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.440
And for me, I was used to the experience to get in something like VirtualBox.

12:07.440 --> 12:11.960
And having used Hyper-V a bit for some of the other distros I like to play with, well,

12:11.960 --> 12:14.920
the experience just hasn't been quite the same.

12:14.920 --> 12:20.560
But now it's going to be a first class experience with improved clipboard integration, dynamic

12:20.560 --> 12:26.760
desktop resizing, and shared folders, and an improved mouse experience so you can move

12:26.760 --> 12:29.000
between the guest and the host.

12:29.000 --> 12:35.720
It seems that they've worked with Microsoft here to just make it a very smooth, very easy

12:35.720 --> 12:36.720
experience.

12:36.720 --> 12:37.720
Yeah, it's interesting.

12:37.720 --> 12:42.280
Microsoft actually has contributed back upstream to the XRDP project, which is an open source

12:42.280 --> 12:45.800
implementation of Microsoft's own remote desktop protocol.

12:45.800 --> 12:50.980
So it looks like some of the new Microsoft in ball here contributed to open source, helping

12:50.980 --> 12:54.160
make open source software run better on their platform.

12:54.160 --> 12:58.760
And this is yet more evidence of Microsoft and Canonical cozying up together, isn't it?

12:58.760 --> 13:04.920
We started with the subsystem for Linux, which was launched with just Ubuntu available.

13:04.920 --> 13:09.320
And now we're getting this Hyper-V integration.

13:09.320 --> 13:12.680
It feels like there's a real relationship building there.

13:12.680 --> 13:15.600
And I think that that is going to worry a lot of people in the community.

13:15.600 --> 13:21.200
Yeah, I mean, they even say in this article, or Will says, our friends over at Microsoft.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.120
So you can tell these barriers have been broken down.

13:24.120 --> 13:27.080
They've worked on, collaborated on many projects now.

13:27.080 --> 13:31.080
So it's not a relationship that easily falls by the wayside, especially when both sides

13:31.080 --> 13:34.060
of the relationship stand to benefit here.

13:34.060 --> 13:36.240
How do you feel about this?

13:36.240 --> 13:37.240
Does it worry you?

13:37.240 --> 13:39.000
Does it make you uncomfortable?

13:39.000 --> 13:43.000
Do you remember the Microsoft of old or do you believe the hype that Microsoft has changed

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
now?

13:44.000 --> 13:47.740
I mean, I've definitely noticed a lot of changes just in the ways they're spending their time

13:47.740 --> 13:51.680
and the people who work there now, whether or not it's permanent, it's hard to say, right?

13:51.680 --> 13:53.700
I mean, corporations are fluid.

13:53.700 --> 13:57.880
They're made of people that leave and come and go and cultures change over time.

13:57.880 --> 14:02.760
But I do think we should be at least somewhat open minded to appreciating the Microsoft

14:02.760 --> 14:06.520
we have at present and be willing to work with them where it makes sense.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.400
They've shown they're willing to put in some time and effort to open source.

14:09.400 --> 14:13.040
And I don't think that we shouldn't think that they are some angel that no longer has

14:13.040 --> 14:14.400
their own interests in mind.

14:14.400 --> 14:17.760
So we should view it through, you know, they want to make money and have a good place in

14:17.760 --> 14:18.760
the market.

14:18.760 --> 14:22.440
There just might be some opportunities for open source to benefit at the same time.

14:22.440 --> 14:23.920
Well, they're following the money, aren't they?

14:23.920 --> 14:26.440
I always say this, the money's in open source.

14:26.440 --> 14:32.200
And keeping people on Windows means they're more likely to tie in with Microsoft services

14:32.200 --> 14:38.920
like Azure and making the Linux experience on the Windows desktop flawless.

14:38.920 --> 14:42.520
Well, that's a good way to do that, isn't it?

14:42.520 --> 14:43.520
Yes.

14:43.520 --> 14:46.000
I know there is some worry that, you know, there might just be people that don't need

14:46.000 --> 14:51.720
to run full Linux anymore, or they won't need to run it, you know, booted from bare metal.

14:51.720 --> 14:56.920
And that may be very true, but there's a number of people stuck on Windows already that can't

14:56.920 --> 14:57.920
do that.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.120
Maybe their enterprise doesn't let them install things like VirtualBox.

15:00.120 --> 15:05.000
Well, Hyper-V is a lot better now, or they have been forced to use an external VM running

15:05.000 --> 15:08.040
on some other infrastructure and suffered for that.

15:08.040 --> 15:13.680
So in a pragmatic sense, yes, I am a little bit worried that there might be less people

15:13.680 --> 15:17.940
out there booting up from a live USB for the first time.

15:17.940 --> 15:21.880
But if they're still getting to experience the joys of using open source technology,

15:21.880 --> 15:24.840
especially on the command line, that makes me happy.

15:24.840 --> 15:29.520
Well, I mentioned the Windows subsystem for Linux, and we've had more news about that

15:29.520 --> 15:30.520
this week.

15:30.520 --> 15:36.600
There's a new distro available, and it is the first distro that has been specifically

15:36.600 --> 15:41.280
built for the Windows subsystem for Linux, and it's called WLinux.

15:41.280 --> 15:44.840
It feels a little strange even calling this a Linux distribution.

15:44.840 --> 15:49.800
It's certainly a distribution of open source software, but it's not even at this point

15:49.800 --> 15:52.240
intended to run on a real Linux kernel.

15:52.240 --> 15:56.360
Yeah, it's funny that, isn't it, that it's everything but Linux, and yet people still

15:56.360 --> 15:57.360
call it Linux.

15:57.360 --> 16:02.640
It's almost like RMS was right, isn't it, calling it GNU slash Linux, and him saying

16:02.640 --> 16:04.080
that Linux is just the kernel.

16:04.080 --> 16:11.200
But yeah, I spoke to Hayden Barnes about this today, and he is the developer of WLinux,

16:11.200 --> 16:14.720
and he has got a very pragmatic approach here.

16:14.720 --> 16:20.920
He's taken Debian and customized it to work as well as it possibly can on the subsystem,

16:20.920 --> 16:24.240
and one of the first things that he did was remove system D.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.880
Get it right out of here, Joe.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.320
You don't need it on Windows.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.000
Well, apparently not, no.

16:29.000 --> 16:34.320
In many ways, this seems like a first, a distribution focused solely on the subsystem.

16:34.320 --> 16:38.320
There's a lot of ways left where the subsystem is just not a complete implementation of the

16:38.320 --> 16:44.920
whole kernel interface, so it might make sense to see this tailored, updated, they even talk

16:44.920 --> 16:48.400
about how they might be able to respond to some certain security issues or other bugs

16:48.400 --> 16:53.160
that are present in upstream software, patch them here before they get fixes all the way

16:53.160 --> 16:58.320
back in upstream, which, as you might imagine, patches specifically for running on the subsystem,

16:58.320 --> 16:59.920
well, they don't always get prioritized.

16:59.920 --> 17:05.440
Well, I asked Hayden what sets this apart from standard Debian, which of course is available

17:05.440 --> 17:12.000
on the subsystem, and he said, well, apart from being made from some parts of Debian

17:12.000 --> 17:16.800
stable and some from Debian testing, it's also the customizations that he's made here

17:16.800 --> 17:24.760
that mean that instead of just kind of sticking a Linux distro on top of Windows, it really

17:24.760 --> 17:30.720
is designed from the ground up to work with it, and that's how he justifies the $20 price

17:30.720 --> 17:31.720
tag.

17:31.720 --> 17:36.200
And I think it markets something that you really have to be a Windows subsystem user

17:36.200 --> 17:40.880
to think about, because for me, I might just install Debian or Ubuntu, because I know Linux,

17:40.880 --> 17:45.560
I like working with a full Linux distribution, but I think for a lot of subsystem users,

17:45.560 --> 17:46.560
that's not really their goal.

17:46.560 --> 17:50.520
They just want to have access to things like developer tools, which are pre-installed on

17:50.520 --> 17:54.780
WLinux, they don't want to have to futz around with trying to get graphical apps working

17:54.780 --> 17:59.940
when they might not be a Linux graphics expert, which, hey, not all of us are.

17:59.940 --> 18:04.480
So if you're willing to just shell out $20 to know that you can get all of the developer

18:04.480 --> 18:07.820
tools you might need for, let's say, your day job or the open source project you're

18:07.820 --> 18:13.620
working on without having to leave the comfort of your Windows workstation, well, it doesn't

18:13.620 --> 18:14.960
seem like that much.

18:14.960 --> 18:19.280
One thing he did say regarding the price to me was that in various other countries, the

18:19.280 --> 18:23.160
price is going to be lower or even potentially nothing.

18:23.160 --> 18:28.840
He mentioned developing countries, it would be cheaper, which is interesting that in the

18:28.840 --> 18:31.840
UK, it's only $10 rather than $20.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.100
So apparently, we're a developing country.

18:34.100 --> 18:35.820
And you're finally recognizing it.

18:35.820 --> 18:37.860
That's good, Joe.

18:37.860 --> 18:41.640
It does seem like there is a fledgling community building here.

18:41.640 --> 18:45.180
They're trying to set up some paid bug bounty programs, and it sounds like they've actually

18:45.180 --> 18:47.060
paid out some bugs already.

18:47.060 --> 18:50.560
So that money may be going right back into the community.

18:50.560 --> 18:56.420
Yeah, and it's interesting that they're focusing on the graphical apps as well, which are somewhat

18:56.420 --> 19:03.580
possible in a kind of hacky way, but they're really kind of doubling down on that and making

19:03.580 --> 19:10.580
it work with an external X server, which, just a quick mention for Flatpaks running

19:10.580 --> 19:17.260
on the subsystem as well now, Alexander Larson, who is the kind of lead dev on Flatpak, tweeted

19:17.260 --> 19:21.040
about this this week that he said it's got some hacky workarounds, but it basically works

19:21.040 --> 19:26.040
and showed some screenshots of it, which it was inevitable at some point this was going

19:26.040 --> 19:27.040
to happen.

19:27.040 --> 19:32.740
But it's pretty cool to see that the Linux community are just doing it for the sake of

19:32.740 --> 19:34.100
it, just for the fun of it almost.

19:34.100 --> 19:35.100
Right.

19:35.100 --> 19:38.380
I mean, you just can't stop us once you give us a playground we can hook into those POSIX

19:38.380 --> 19:43.540
APIs that we know and love, while software and tweaks are going to be the result.

19:43.540 --> 19:44.540
All right.

19:44.540 --> 19:50.220
Well, let's end with a story that broke as we were recording last week, which I'm kind

19:50.220 --> 19:54.840
of glad that we had a whole week to digest this because it's pretty big news, isn't it?

19:54.840 --> 19:59.100
And that is that Linus has decided to take a break from kernel development.

19:59.100 --> 20:05.820
We don't know exactly how long for, but it's at least for the rest of the 4.19 cycle.

20:05.820 --> 20:10.580
And this has caused a bit of a stink on the internet this week, would you say?

20:10.580 --> 20:12.940
Oh, my yes, Joe.

20:12.940 --> 20:19.860
And at the same time, or really shortly before, I think, well, the old code of conflict has

20:19.860 --> 20:22.500
been replaced with a new contributor covenant.

20:22.500 --> 20:28.180
Yeah, now this new code of conduct based on the contributor covenant, that is a very standard

20:28.180 --> 20:29.180
code of conduct, isn't it?

20:29.180 --> 20:33.780
It's used across a lot of open source projects.

20:33.780 --> 20:40.420
And it kind of brings Linux into line really with the rest of the industry.

20:40.420 --> 20:46.020
Before it stood out as this kind of separate thing, where Linus could just do whatever

20:46.020 --> 20:50.260
he wanted, be rude to people on the mailing list and say all sorts of offensive things

20:50.260 --> 20:55.460
and get away with it, whereas now, he pretty much can't do that anymore.

20:55.460 --> 20:56.980
And that's why he's taking a break.

20:56.980 --> 21:02.140
He said in the email announcing this, this week, people in our community confronted me

21:02.140 --> 21:05.260
about my lifetime of not understanding emotions.

21:05.260 --> 21:10.100
My flippant attacks and emails have been both unprofessional and uncalled for, especially

21:10.100 --> 21:12.820
at times when I made it personal.

21:12.820 --> 21:15.460
In my quest for a better patch, this made sense to me.

21:15.460 --> 21:19.020
I know now that this was not okay, and I am truly sorry.

21:19.020 --> 21:23.740
I'm going to take time off and get some assistance on how to understand people's emotions and

21:23.740 --> 21:26.000
respond appropriately.

21:26.000 --> 21:30.340
Now that was the first thing that I had heard about it, and then I learned about this new

21:30.340 --> 21:31.340
code of conduct.

21:31.340 --> 21:35.580
And I was trying to put together what exactly had happened here.

21:35.580 --> 21:41.860
And then on Wednesday, there was an article in the New Yorker, and that article was primarily

21:41.860 --> 21:48.780
focused on the lack of women in the Linux kernel development community and how it has

21:48.780 --> 21:51.860
been hostile to them.

21:51.860 --> 21:57.780
And in the article in the New Yorker, it said that they had reached out to Linus, and by

21:57.780 --> 22:02.580
the looks of things, the foundation as well, in advance of publishing it, saying that plenty

22:02.580 --> 22:06.840
of examples of him being hostile to women and other people.

22:06.840 --> 22:08.820
And it seems that that is what has triggered this.

22:08.820 --> 22:14.300
Clearly, there's been conversations going about these matters for really years, but

22:14.300 --> 22:19.980
that article brought it all to a head, probably in some ways to try to manage the PR around

22:19.980 --> 22:20.980
it.

22:20.980 --> 22:22.540
This new agreement was kind of pushed into place.

22:22.540 --> 22:26.180
There's a number of developers who, at least in theory, agree with some of the principles

22:26.180 --> 22:30.320
in the code, and as you say, it is adopted in a number of other large, successful open

22:30.320 --> 22:31.820
source projects.

22:31.820 --> 22:37.340
But the way it was just adopted so abruptly, without a big community-wide discussion, doesn't

22:37.340 --> 22:38.900
sit well with a lot of other people.

22:38.900 --> 22:43.980
Well, the funny thing is that it doesn't sit well with people on both sides of the argument.

22:43.980 --> 22:49.220
Because there are people who are saying that this is politics invading the Linux kernel,

22:49.220 --> 22:52.460
and we don't need this, and everything was fine before.

22:52.460 --> 22:57.700
But then you have people on the other extreme saying that this doesn't go far enough, and

22:57.700 --> 23:02.380
it's really just paying lip service to the issues that are underlying here that have

23:02.380 --> 23:04.940
been festering for a long time.

23:04.940 --> 23:12.180
And the fact that anyone who is in violation of this code of conduct gets reported to a

23:12.180 --> 23:13.940
committee that are all men.

23:13.940 --> 23:22.740
So if you are a woman, or transgender, or whatever, you are not represented on that

23:22.740 --> 23:26.120
board of people who are supposed to be sorting this out.

23:26.120 --> 23:30.420
So it's just a real mess of strong opinions.

23:30.420 --> 23:34.380
And that's kind of why I'm glad that we had this week to think about it.

23:34.380 --> 23:38.020
But even then, I still don't know exactly where to stand on this whole thing.

23:38.020 --> 23:42.460
I think it's difficult because this sort of large community culture change takes a long

23:42.460 --> 23:44.000
time to fully happen.

23:44.000 --> 23:50.260
And we're still in that awkward, quiet period after all the announcements and all the drama.

23:50.260 --> 23:54.980
What will really matter is how does the technical advisory board actually function in this new

23:54.980 --> 23:55.980
role?

23:55.980 --> 23:59.860
What sort of disagreements, what sort of violations get reported, and how are those dealt with?

23:59.860 --> 24:03.940
Is this probably something we just have to watch over the next months and years to come?

24:03.940 --> 24:04.940
Yeah, definitely.

24:04.940 --> 24:10.300
But there's one thing that is clear to me, and that is that politics has become involved

24:10.300 --> 24:12.820
in kind of development now.

24:12.820 --> 24:17.780
And whether or not you think that's a good thing or a bad thing, well, that's up to you,

24:17.780 --> 24:18.780
dear listener.

24:18.780 --> 24:23.100
But we are now in new times, aren't we?

24:23.100 --> 24:31.340
The politics have come into this world, like it or not, and it's going to change it.

24:31.340 --> 24:35.740
And whether that is for better or worse, it really just depends on people's perspective,

24:35.740 --> 24:36.740
I think.

24:36.740 --> 24:41.620
Yeah, people's perspectives, actions, and if the kernel community can find a way to

24:41.620 --> 24:46.860
embrace these changes without a lot of collateral damage, are people's intentions good?

24:46.860 --> 24:51.140
Or does this become just another way to have more flame wars on the mailing list?

24:51.140 --> 24:54.340
Yeah, well, we'll soon see about that.

24:54.340 --> 24:59.060
Well, this is a story that is not going to go away, and I have a feeling we may well

24:59.060 --> 25:01.620
be talking about it in future weeks.

25:01.620 --> 25:05.660
