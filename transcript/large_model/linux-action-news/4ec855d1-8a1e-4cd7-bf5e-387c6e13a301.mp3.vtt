Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.200 --> 00:20.320
This is episode 42, recorded on February 25th, 2018.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.320
I'm Chris.

00:21.320 --> 00:22.320
And I'm Joe.

00:22.320 --> 00:23.320
Hello, Joe.

00:23.320 --> 00:26.320
It's good to be connected with you again today, and I'm pretty excited to announce that a

00:26.320 --> 00:30.360
new version of Lineage, version 15.1, is finally here.

00:30.360 --> 00:35.040
Yeah, it's been in the works for an awfully long time, but now it is finally here and

00:35.040 --> 00:36.220
stable.

00:36.220 --> 00:38.620
So this is based on Android 8.1 Oreo.

00:38.620 --> 00:41.560
They skipped 8 and went straight to 8.1.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.520
And it's only available for a few devices, but let's look down that list there.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.080
Oh, yes, 1 plus 3T.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.080
Sweet.

00:47.080 --> 00:48.080
I'll be getting this.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.160
Very nice.

00:49.160 --> 00:54.660
Actually, what I really like about Lineage, even as a non-user, is 15.1 introduces the

00:54.660 --> 00:56.880
rebase with Project Treble.

00:56.880 --> 01:02.080
Yeah, that's a lot of why it's only on certain devices, because it's very difficult.

01:02.080 --> 01:06.840
This has been one of the hardest changes for them to move from 14.1 to 15.1, because of

01:06.840 --> 01:08.560
all this Project Treble stuff.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.720
And that means that this launch of 15.1 is only with a select number of devices, but

01:12.720 --> 01:15.400
they do say they are working on the other ones.

01:15.400 --> 01:20.240
And fingers crossed, because I've got some pretty old legacy devices at this point, like

01:20.240 --> 01:22.800
the old Nexus 7, which is still a great tablet.

01:22.800 --> 01:26.920
So I'm looking forward to hopefully getting 15.1 running on that at some point.

01:26.920 --> 01:27.920
Yeah, absolutely.

01:27.920 --> 01:28.980
I mean, think about this.

01:28.980 --> 01:30.120
Think about the context of this.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.200
This project has really grown.

01:32.200 --> 01:40.240
It supports over 180 devices, which reaches 1.8 million users and has over 700 contributors.

01:40.240 --> 01:45.840
So when they rebase using Project Treble, it is a rework that really positions them

01:45.840 --> 01:49.040
to support future devices way, way, way down the road.

01:49.040 --> 01:53.880
So they kind of had to eat that crap sandwich for this release, and it took a long time,

01:53.880 --> 01:56.080
and it meant supporting less devices.

01:56.080 --> 02:00.560
But long term, I think it means they could actually integrate future versions of Android

02:00.560 --> 02:03.200
and support a wider range of hardware a lot faster.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.560
Well, that's the promise of Project Treble, isn't it?

02:05.560 --> 02:11.240
And I'm really hoping that you're right there, because I really rely on lineage at this point.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.280
I just cannot be doing with stock ROMs anymore.

02:13.280 --> 02:14.600
I haven't for a long time.

02:14.600 --> 02:17.480
I wouldn't buy a device that's not supported by lineage.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.280
I think that says everything right there.

02:19.280 --> 02:22.160
And the other thing that happened in this release that I think is going to be good for

02:22.160 --> 02:28.980
future device support is they have an official device support requirements charter now.

02:28.980 --> 02:35.160
It's a document which outlines all of the requirements that a build of lineage OS and

02:35.160 --> 02:40.040
its maintainer must meet in order to be determined, quote unquote, official.

02:40.040 --> 02:44.880
Yeah, obviously there are a number of unofficial builds knocking around XDA, and they can be

02:44.880 --> 02:49.080
a little bit ropey sometimes, like Wi-Fi not working or cellular or whatever.

02:49.080 --> 02:54.760
Whereas now official devices, you know there is a certain list of criteria they must meet,

02:54.760 --> 02:57.240
and therefore these ROMs are going to actually work properly.

02:57.240 --> 03:01.800
And I'm surprised that it's taken them this long to put that in place really, because

03:01.800 --> 03:06.800
it's good to know now, OK, I can put that on someone's phone for them or tablet or whatever,

03:06.800 --> 03:08.980
and you know, OK, it's officially supported.

03:08.980 --> 03:09.980
It's going to work properly.

03:09.980 --> 03:10.980
Yeah.

03:10.980 --> 03:14.720
So this device support requirements charter is pretty simple at this point.

03:14.720 --> 03:21.080
It's not even very long, but it in general ensures that official builds of lineage 15.1

03:21.080 --> 03:25.800
support all basic hardware that is possible, as well as receives patches against any high

03:25.800 --> 03:27.480
profile vulnerabilities.

03:27.480 --> 03:31.480
So you were saying earlier you only buy a device that you know will run lineage.

03:31.480 --> 03:35.560
Well now here's an actual charter to check off compatibility and say, yep, it meets the

03:35.560 --> 03:36.560
charter requirements.

03:36.560 --> 03:40.760
Yeah, and that security update thing is a major factor for me, knowing that it's not

03:40.760 --> 03:42.600
going to be just abandoned.

03:42.600 --> 03:46.680
And that's one of the greatest things about custom ROMs, isn't it, that you get these

03:46.680 --> 03:52.920
devices that are abandoned by the OEM, and then the good people at lineage or other ROMs

03:52.920 --> 03:57.360
pick it up and actually back port security fixes to it, and so you're not just left high

03:57.360 --> 03:58.360
and dry.

03:58.360 --> 04:01.680
Well, if you're like me and Android isn't quite your cup of tea, I've got my Nexus 6P

04:01.680 --> 04:05.360
and I love it, but it's never really hit that perfect spot for me.

04:05.360 --> 04:11.160
I've followed the UBports project with a special amount of interest, my plan B, if you will.

04:11.160 --> 04:15.480
And this week, they have some news, but I don't believe it's on the phone.

04:15.480 --> 04:20.800
Yeah, this is about Unity 8, which as we know, Canonical abandoned the development of back

04:20.800 --> 04:22.820
in April last year.

04:22.820 --> 04:29.880
And it kind of limped on as unit, Unity with a Y, but that seems to have come to an end,

04:29.880 --> 04:32.200
that project, it kind of never went anywhere.

04:32.200 --> 04:39.320
So now UBports are kind of officially taking on responsibility for keeping it going.

04:39.320 --> 04:44.100
And there is a way to get it running on Ubuntu 18.04.

04:44.100 --> 04:50.120
So if you did like where they were going with this Qt based version of Unity, then you can

04:50.120 --> 04:51.640
at least test it out.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.800
I'll admit this has me scratching my head a bit.

04:53.800 --> 04:58.280
The plasma desktop is sort of the premier Qt environment, but I can see it if you're

04:58.280 --> 05:01.080
really going for that vision of convergence.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.160
Well, yeah, exactly.

05:03.160 --> 05:07.960
They kind of have to keep Unity 8 going if they want to have convergence working at some

05:07.960 --> 05:08.960
point.

05:08.960 --> 05:12.800
So let's face it, this is very alpha at this point.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.800
The desktop works, but no X applications work.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.600
It's not really a usable daily driver.

05:18.600 --> 05:21.760
You're not going to get any serious work done with it.

05:21.760 --> 05:25.920
And they have to keep it on the back burner because they're concentrating on making the

05:25.920 --> 05:29.360
actual Ubuntu Touch phone operating system for now.

05:29.360 --> 05:33.560
But once they get that to a point where it's seriously usable with the inbox stuff running

05:33.560 --> 05:39.840
Android applications, the logical next step for them would be to get convergence working.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.640
And they can't really abandon Unity 8 and just totally shelve it.

05:43.640 --> 05:45.760
They have to keep it ticking over.

05:45.760 --> 05:50.480
And this seems a good way as any, make sure it's working on 18.04 and get people testing

05:50.480 --> 05:51.480
it.

05:51.480 --> 05:54.440
But I don't think they're investing masses of resources into it.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.040
I don't think it's for me yet, Joe.

05:56.040 --> 06:00.840
But I am supremely interested to see how far they can take this thing because all of the

06:00.840 --> 06:04.600
fundamentals are actually there and some of the hard work has been done.

06:04.600 --> 06:07.200
So how far can the UBports take this thing?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.200
That's what I'll be watching.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.860
Yeah, I feel like they're sort of quietly beavering away.

06:10.860 --> 06:16.120
We talk a lot about what Purism are doing with their phone and everything, but I think

06:16.120 --> 06:22.520
the last man standing when it comes to alternatives to Android that are based on Linux might well

06:22.520 --> 06:27.200
end up being Ubuntu Touch because it's a community project.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.620
It's not backed by some huge company.

06:29.620 --> 06:33.360
They don't have to make it amazing, they just have to have enough donations coming in to

06:33.360 --> 06:34.360
keep it going.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.600
And I think it's going to tick away and tick away and tick away.

06:36.600 --> 06:40.360
And I don't know, I just have a lot of confidence in it long term.

06:40.360 --> 06:47.080
Not being this huge Android iOS competitor that's going to have normal people using it.

06:47.080 --> 06:52.240
But I think that it's going to find its niche long term and it's going to get to a point

06:52.240 --> 06:59.080
where people who want a proper Linux box in their pocket will be able to use it.

06:59.080 --> 07:02.840
And we're going to have convergence as part of that.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.400
And it's a long way off, but we need things like them working on Unity 8 to be part of

07:06.400 --> 07:08.440
that grand vision long term.

07:08.440 --> 07:09.440
I agree.

07:09.440 --> 07:13.720
And that's an interesting observation that perhaps it requires an open source project

07:13.720 --> 07:17.080
that can just tool away at it for maybe a decade to nail this thing.

07:17.080 --> 07:20.720
And that's what it'll take to unseat the entrenched interest.

07:20.720 --> 07:25.360
That's an interesting idea and it makes me a bigger fan of the UbiPorts project overall.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.000
And this is an indication of where they're going long term.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.680
It's really long term about convergence.

07:31.680 --> 07:35.800
And maybe it'll help them get there a little faster and a little easier if they have some

07:35.800 --> 07:38.240
real data to base some decisions off of.

07:38.240 --> 07:43.120
Yeah, so this is something we talked about last week, how Canonical want to collect some

07:43.120 --> 07:48.840
metrics on Ubuntu users and that that is going to be opt out.

07:48.840 --> 07:54.120
The checkbox is going to be on by default and we covered the controversy about that.

07:54.120 --> 08:01.080
Well, they've cleared up one question this week and that is people upgrading to 18.04.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.080
That's going to be opt in.

08:02.080 --> 08:05.600
You're going to have to, once you've gone through the upgrade process, go in and actively

08:05.600 --> 08:07.040
opt into that.

08:07.040 --> 08:13.040
Although there is talk of trying to find an elegant way to prompt users during the update,

08:13.040 --> 08:16.180
but not that confident about that, I'm afraid.

08:16.180 --> 08:19.520
It's called an end curses interface, my friend, and it's wonderful.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.880
And I think they should do it.

08:20.880 --> 08:25.800
I've talked to both Dustin Kirkland and Will Cook directly in last week's Linux Unplugged

08:25.800 --> 08:28.000
and got all of my questions answered.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.560
And some of the things that people have been worried about, like location tracking, they

08:31.560 --> 08:35.200
are not even getting down beyond just the country that you're in.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.200
I'm all about this.

08:36.200 --> 08:41.320
I think if they can figure out what packages are used more, what applications crash more,

08:41.320 --> 08:44.960
and the most common types of hardware setups that people have, then not only does Ubuntu

08:44.960 --> 08:47.880
get better, but all of the downstream distributions get better.

08:47.880 --> 08:53.440
Yeah, I can kind of see it, but I really hope that Canonical and the people working there

08:53.440 --> 08:57.240
have read Stuart Langridge's blog post about this.

08:57.240 --> 09:03.800
He didn't call out Ubuntu specifically, but the timing of it is clearly not a coincidence.

09:03.800 --> 09:07.800
And it's entitled Collecting User Data While Protecting User Privacy.

09:07.800 --> 09:12.520
And he talks a lot about data science and aggregation and stuff.

09:12.520 --> 09:16.200
And one of the key points in it that I'd never really thought about, because I don't really

09:16.200 --> 09:23.480
think much about data science, is that you can collect data in a way that totally anonymizes

09:23.480 --> 09:29.120
people by having a certain percentage of those machines reporting false information.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.120
Yeah, they lie.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.300
Well, that's the thing.

09:31.300 --> 09:37.600
If you know that 20% of the users that are reporting data back to you or users machines

09:37.600 --> 09:43.360
that are reporting back to you are reporting slightly false information, it averages out

09:43.360 --> 09:48.680
to give you essentially the same statistical data, but everyone is completely anonymous

09:48.680 --> 09:51.480
because you don't know whether their machine lied to you or not.

09:51.480 --> 09:54.960
Right, so in aggregate, the stats are actually fairly accurate.

09:54.960 --> 10:01.100
Yeah, and this only works if you are truly interested in just statistical analysis like

10:01.100 --> 10:02.320
Canonical say they are.

10:02.320 --> 10:08.400
If you're a company who is trying to track people and do evil stuff, then this becomes

10:08.400 --> 10:09.680
absolutely useless to you.

10:09.680 --> 10:15.240
So let's hope that they actually do something like this and prove everyone wrong that they

10:15.240 --> 10:17.880
are only interested in the statistics.

10:17.880 --> 10:22.600
This reminds me of the collection of data model that Apple claims that they supposedly

10:22.600 --> 10:24.800
implement called differential privacy.

10:24.800 --> 10:25.800
And it's essentially this.

10:25.800 --> 10:28.960
Well, you would hope that it would be an industry standard at this point.

10:28.960 --> 10:33.520
And that's why last week when we talked about this, I said that I really want them to open

10:33.520 --> 10:37.860
source their back end technology that is analyzing this data.

10:37.860 --> 10:43.000
Because if it does turn out that they are doing this, then I think a lot of people are

10:43.000 --> 10:50.880
going to be far more relaxed about it and will go far easier on them.

10:50.880 --> 10:51.880
Digitalocean.com.

10:51.880 --> 11:00.760
In fact, even better for a limited time, go to do.co action and get a $100 credit at Digital

11:00.760 --> 11:01.760
Ocean.

11:01.760 --> 11:05.480
New accounts only, but this is the perfect opportunity to try out Digital Ocean.

11:05.480 --> 11:08.560
Digital Ocean is infrastructure that you can spin up on demand.

11:08.560 --> 11:12.720
Everything is on SSDs, and they're resizable depending on your requirements.

11:12.720 --> 11:17.160
You select the region, they have eight data centers all over the world, and then you go.

11:17.160 --> 11:18.440
Now they have standard droplets.

11:18.440 --> 11:21.840
Those have gotten even better, more competitive, the price is even lower.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.440
But what I love are the flexible droplets.

11:24.440 --> 11:29.560
For around $15 a month, you mix and match everything to what your application needs.

11:29.560 --> 11:33.680
do.co action to get in on that $100 credit.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.120
They have the best dashboard, ready to go applications.

11:36.120 --> 11:40.720
You can employ an entire GitLab stack with a single click, bam, that gets deployed on

11:40.720 --> 11:42.080
the Digital Ocean droplet.

11:42.080 --> 11:48.000
Or you can build a system all the way up from the ground up using CoreOS or Fedora or FreeBSD

11:48.000 --> 11:49.760
or Debian or Ubuntu.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.560
Whatever you like, you can deploy it on Digital Ocean.

11:52.560 --> 11:56.640
Then you use their great dashboard, their API, or whatever floats your boat.

11:56.640 --> 11:57.640
Digitalocean.com.

11:57.640 --> 12:05.440
Better than that, do.co action.

12:05.440 --> 12:07.840
Excellent news for the Signal project this week.

12:07.840 --> 12:14.240
They now have a foundation thanks to a $50 million cash injection by Brian Acton, who

12:14.240 --> 12:16.560
was one of the co-founders of WhatsApp.

12:16.560 --> 12:20.840
So that's got to be good news for user privacy and encrypted messaging.

12:20.840 --> 12:25.280
Yeah, over on the Signal blog, they talk about all of the things they can do now.

12:25.280 --> 12:29.760
They say they can increase the size of their team, their capacity, and their ambitions.

12:29.760 --> 12:34.280
And it means it reduces the uncertainty on the path to sustainability.

12:34.280 --> 12:39.120
And there is a bit of a tone that comes across in this blog post from Moxie himself.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.720
And the tone is, we haven't gotten to where we want to be yet.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.800
We wanted to be more competitive by this point.

12:45.800 --> 12:50.440
But by sticking to our ideals and not taking any VC funding, we haven't been able to really

12:50.440 --> 12:55.600
keep up with the telegrams and the other messaging platforms of the world.

12:55.600 --> 13:00.800
And maybe now, with $50 million of funding into a foundation, we'll begin to build the

13:00.800 --> 13:02.240
runway to do that.

13:02.240 --> 13:07.080
But this WhatsApp connection, again, WhatsApp uses the Signal protocol, doesn't it, for

13:07.080 --> 13:08.860
the encryption.

13:08.860 --> 13:14.640
And yet they don't contribute back any changes because they've got some weird license agreement.

13:14.640 --> 13:18.540
I've always found it very strange, this relationship that they have.

13:18.540 --> 13:25.920
And that's further complicated by Brian Acton, who was one of the co-founders, actually giving

13:25.920 --> 13:27.360
them this money to do it.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.560
It's all a bit strange, isn't it?

13:29.560 --> 13:34.120
What's even more interesting, Joe, is that Moxie writes in this blog post, he says, perhaps

13:34.120 --> 13:40.140
most significantly, the addition of Brian brings an incredibly talented engineer and

13:40.140 --> 13:44.200
visionary with decades of experience to our products team.

13:44.200 --> 13:49.280
Like, Brian Acton's going to take an active role in the development of Signal.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.880
Well, he's certainly very successful, isn't he?

13:51.880 --> 13:53.400
And he must be a good engineer.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.320
So this has got to be good news for Signal.

13:56.320 --> 13:59.360
I mean, I don't know anyone who doesn't use WhatsApp in this country.

13:59.360 --> 14:03.360
I know it's not that popular over there, but here it is huge.

14:03.360 --> 14:08.060
I do think it's popular in the States among a certain demo, but yeah, from just the conversations

14:08.060 --> 14:11.680
you and I have had offline, it doesn't sound like it's quite as popular.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.860
But it is a well-known name.

14:13.860 --> 14:16.200
And that's a big deal in this market.

14:16.200 --> 14:20.900
When you combine the funding through this foundation, the name of Brian Acton and his

14:20.900 --> 14:27.200
experience and the name of Moxie, long, long term, 10 years down the road, I would bet

14:27.200 --> 14:31.860
all of the Bitcoin on Signal and not so much on Telegram or other, quote unquote, secure

14:31.860 --> 14:33.040
messaging programs.

14:33.040 --> 14:37.880
Yeah, it makes me kind of tempted to give it a go, really, that now I know they're going

14:37.880 --> 14:42.960
to have some investment here and develop well, and hopefully they can trigger some sort of

14:42.960 --> 14:47.960
network effect with this because it's not really much use if no one else is using it,

14:47.960 --> 14:48.960
is it?

14:48.960 --> 14:52.840
And I don't know that many people using Signal, whereas everyone seems to use either WhatsApp

14:52.840 --> 14:54.320
or Telegram at this point.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.960
I mean, there's some people I still talk to on Hangouts.

14:56.960 --> 14:59.240
Do I need another messenger at this point?

14:59.240 --> 15:03.040
I'm not sure you do, but you do need another CPU architecture.

15:03.040 --> 15:08.520
Yeah, RISC-V, which is the completely open CPU architecture.

15:08.520 --> 15:14.800
Now there's a seriously good dev board available for pre-order, but it's going to be shipping

15:14.800 --> 15:16.360
soon.

15:16.360 --> 15:21.320
And this is called the Hi5 Unleashed, and this is from a company called Psi5.

15:21.320 --> 15:27.440
And it was kind of a weird crowdfunder on CrowdSupply where it was $1 was their goal.

15:27.440 --> 15:32.460
So it's really just using CrowdSupply to process the payments, really.

15:32.460 --> 15:38.200
And they've raised $117,000, but here's the kicker.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.340
It's $999, okay?

15:41.340 --> 15:43.860
It's got eight gigabytes of RAM.

15:43.860 --> 15:49.920
It's a decent board, but I remember we talked about at Christmas, my hopes were that we

15:49.920 --> 15:55.720
were going to get a Raspberry Pi competitor based on RISC-V. And okay, this is kind of

15:55.720 --> 16:00.680
of that ilk, but this is no Raspberry Pi competitor at nearly $1,000.

16:00.680 --> 16:05.720
999 US greenbacks, eight gigabytes of RAM on that sucker, right?

16:05.720 --> 16:11.320
Eight gigabytes of RAM, a micro SD card slot, it has an expansion port, and you've got that

16:11.320 --> 16:12.860
essential five-core.

16:12.860 --> 16:17.680
It's four cores of high-performance CPUs and one low-performance CPU.

16:17.680 --> 16:22.100
So it's, I say essentially five-core, it's really four usable cores and then like a low-power

16:22.100 --> 16:23.600
core.

16:23.600 --> 16:27.720
And they're going to start shipping this thing March 2018.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.760
I can't afford this, Elon Musk might be able to afford this.

16:30.760 --> 16:37.460
If this could get in the price range of $100, I think even around there, even close to $100,

16:37.460 --> 16:38.720
it's a great buy.

16:38.720 --> 16:42.020
Yeah, this is a very limited run.

16:42.020 --> 16:43.760
It's the first run.

16:43.760 --> 16:50.040
It's for developers and people who want to back this whole movement towards a totally

16:50.040 --> 16:52.440
free architecture.

16:52.440 --> 16:55.680
It's not for people who want to tinker on the weekends.

16:55.680 --> 16:59.220
It's for people who are full-time invested in this stuff.

16:59.220 --> 17:04.320
And once they can expand the production run, the price is hopefully going to drop significantly.

17:04.320 --> 17:06.600
And it's clearly popular.

17:06.600 --> 17:11.760
There's a hundred people have backed this, which, okay, it's not that many, but it's

17:11.760 --> 17:15.880
a hundred thousand dollars plus that's gone into it.

17:15.880 --> 17:18.040
So it shows that there is a market for this.

17:18.040 --> 17:21.760
People do care about a completely open architecture.

17:21.760 --> 17:26.400
I really want to see the benchmarks on this and how it compares to ARM because it's not

17:26.400 --> 17:27.880
going to compete with x86.

17:27.880 --> 17:36.000
That's quite clear, but how does it compare to ARM CPUs of a similar power draw and similar

17:36.000 --> 17:37.800
frequency, that sort of thing.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.880
I said it at Christmas and I'm saying it now.

17:39.880 --> 17:44.040
We need this to be good and we need people to invest in it.

17:44.040 --> 17:50.940
And already there's a Fedora image for RISC-V that hopefully will work on this device.

17:50.940 --> 17:55.320
The whole RISC-V platform and building system on a chips that are completely free and open

17:55.320 --> 18:00.440
to run Linux is one of the stories that is going to be really fascinating to follow throughout

18:00.440 --> 18:02.040
2018.

18:02.040 --> 18:06.280
Find a link to the video of the launch at linuxactionnews.com slash 42.

18:06.280 --> 18:10.680
In fact, links to everything we've talked about today, linuxactionnews.com slash 42,

18:10.680 --> 18:13.700
but specifically I linked in there the FOSDEM link.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.880
It goes right to the MP4 of the launch of the HIFive.

18:16.880 --> 18:22.800
Yeah, hopefully a big year for RISC-V and freedom in general.

18:22.800 --> 18:27.080
And it's also a big year for comebacks, by the looks of things.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.680
Tech Talk Today's back?

18:28.680 --> 18:29.680
Surely not.

18:29.680 --> 18:30.840
I couldn't help myself.

18:30.840 --> 18:35.240
Tech Talk Today, techtalk.today slash 261, the launch.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.960
Yeah, I'm bringing it back for 10 episodes.

18:37.960 --> 18:42.120
I thought it'd be fun to do a limited run because when we launch podcasts, we always

18:42.120 --> 18:44.160
just go indefinitely forever.

18:44.160 --> 18:48.120
So what if I launched a podcast and I said I'm only doing 10 episodes?

18:48.120 --> 18:51.580
So for those people who have never heard Tech Talk Today, what's it all about?

18:51.580 --> 18:55.820
It's really taking a look at the news in technology of the day from the perspective of the open

18:55.820 --> 19:02.000
source community outside the Silicon Valley bubble with a broader understanding of technology

19:02.000 --> 19:05.560
and its impact on our privacy, our security, monitoring us.

19:05.560 --> 19:08.800
A lot of times, it's not that there aren't other tech shows.

19:08.800 --> 19:14.740
They're just really super focused on smartphones and all of the cool stuff coming out of California.

19:14.740 --> 19:19.040
And I have the advantage of being outside that bubble and in the open source community.

19:19.040 --> 19:22.680
So it's looking with that perspective, trying to tell a story, tell everybody something

19:22.680 --> 19:25.120
interesting, get them caught up on the news that matters.

19:25.120 --> 19:29.480
And while I'm going down to scale, the story of going to scale, interacting with the Linux

19:29.480 --> 19:30.480
community.

19:30.480 --> 19:35.840
And if I could be so lucky, where the hell Linux is going in 2018?

19:35.840 --> 19:39.720
I want to try to include all of that in season one of Tech Talk Today.

19:39.720 --> 19:43.000
That's an awful lot to pack into 10 episodes, so I look forward to listening to the next

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
nine.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Yeah.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.760
I don't know if I'll be able to pull it off, but I'm going to give it my best, techtalk.today

19:47.760 --> 19:54.000
and you can go to techtalk.today.com to get every single new episode, just like you can

19:54.000 --> 19:59.320
go to linuxactionnews.com and get every single episode of this show.

19:59.320 --> 20:03.920
Yeah, and you can go to linuxactionnews.com for ways to get in touch with us.

20:03.920 --> 20:09.440
And we have tons of exciting things in store for 2018, and we could use your support and

20:09.440 --> 20:14.880
get exclusive Tech Talk Today extras at patreon.com Jupiter signal.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.720
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.560
I'm at Chris LAS.

20:20.560 --> 20:22.160
I'm at Joe Rissington.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.680
Thank you for joining us, and we'll see you next week.

20:24.680 --> 20:45.200
See you later.
