00:00.000 --> 00:09.020
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 217, recorded on November 28th, 2021.

00:09.020 --> 00:10.020
I'm Chris.

00:10.020 --> 00:11.020
And I'm Wes.

00:11.020 --> 00:12.020
Hello, Wes.

00:12.020 --> 00:13.020
Let's do the news.

00:13.020 --> 00:17.380
And we start this week with what might just end up the first RISC-V powered phone you'll

00:17.380 --> 00:21.580
be able to catch your hands on, and it could be just around the corner.

00:21.580 --> 00:26.460
With Linux support nearly complete for several RISC-V chipsets, and an increasing quantity

00:26.460 --> 00:32.080
of chips powering Linux single board computers with prices as low as $12, RISC-V seems to

00:32.080 --> 00:34.960
be entering a new phase of maturation.

00:34.960 --> 00:39.660
With this next phase comes the next major challenge, though, turning us all into an

00:39.660 --> 01:09.600
ecosystem for both developers and product builders.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.560
And Android support is finally getting in much better shape.

01:12.560 --> 01:17.060
It was helped definitely by later versions of Android tracking much closer to the mainline

01:17.060 --> 01:21.240
Linux kernel, which has improved its RISC-V support a lot in recent years.

01:21.240 --> 01:25.320
Alibaba has also been one of the first to produce a working Android 10 port over to

01:25.320 --> 01:29.840
the RISC-V architecture, complete even with GPU drivers.

01:29.840 --> 01:36.200
But this week, leading RISC-V manufacturer SySpeed demoed a full Android 10 system on

01:36.200 --> 01:38.140
a seven inch touchscreen.

01:38.140 --> 01:41.320
This was building off some of their work last year when SySpeed produced the smartphone

01:41.320 --> 01:47.180
like my ex amigo development kit as the first experiment for free hardware PDA.

01:47.180 --> 01:51.880
One part development kit, one part learning kit, I guess you could say it was a fairly

01:51.880 --> 01:58.200
robust looking device and not all that impressive spec wise, but an early RISC device nonetheless.

01:58.200 --> 02:03.200
And you could easily see them putting something like that together, but maybe version two

02:03.200 --> 02:06.940
is powered by a RISC-V chip in there.

02:06.940 --> 02:12.100
And supply chain shortages, aside from what I'm reading, all of the bits are really there.

02:12.100 --> 02:15.340
They just need to put it all together in a mobile dev kit now.

02:15.340 --> 02:19.360
And according to SySpeed, a RISC-V device like this, like a little phone or learning

02:19.360 --> 02:24.460
kit would be more powerful than like a quad core A73 ARM processor.

02:24.460 --> 02:29.960
So possibly in line with Qualcomm Snapdragon 663 or 662 SoCs.

02:29.960 --> 02:35.080
We'll keep our ears on the party line and give you a ring if a RISC-V Linux phone comes

02:35.080 --> 02:36.580
a call on.

02:36.580 --> 02:43.220
But while we're speaking of super cheap RISC-V devices, measuring just 46 by 25 millimeters

02:43.220 --> 02:51.020
in the style of a Pi compute module, the all-winner D1 packs a one gigahertz CPU and 512 megs

02:51.020 --> 02:55.260
of DDR3 RAM, all for just $17.

02:55.260 --> 02:59.340
Just like a first glance looking at this thing, it looks like a stick of RAM.

02:59.340 --> 03:04.520
Like a laptop, small size stick of RAM with just a few extra bits on it.

03:04.520 --> 03:09.140
They're designed to slot right into a docking board that will have additional connectivity.

03:09.140 --> 03:12.620
Maybe like HDMI, Ethernet, and GPIO pins, etc.

03:12.620 --> 03:16.740
But I like to take these things to like an extreme version, maybe that's years down the

03:16.740 --> 03:17.740
road.

03:17.740 --> 03:22.620
And I picture a blade server with like 300 of these things.

03:22.620 --> 03:26.840
And they're all installed inside this one larger box integrated into some sort of high

03:26.840 --> 03:31.700
speed backplane, making it like a ginormous Beowulf cluster in a box.

03:31.700 --> 03:35.940
I don't like where you're going with this, but they've actually got to ship these things

03:35.940 --> 03:36.940
first.

03:36.940 --> 03:41.780
Thankfully, though, the D1 is available now on AliExpress, and those docking boards are

03:41.780 --> 03:46.940
supposed to start shipping within the next month or so.

03:46.940 --> 03:50.980
It's a holiday week here in the States, and so there's not a lot of breaking news in the

03:50.980 --> 03:52.940
Linux and open source community.

03:52.940 --> 03:57.220
But there actually have been a few essential developments we wanted you to be aware of.

03:57.220 --> 04:02.860
In the background, for years, the LLVM project has been working on a massive relicensing

04:02.860 --> 04:04.020
effort for its code base.

04:04.020 --> 04:07.580
And we wanted to bring it to your attention this week because a there's been some developments,

04:07.580 --> 04:12.620
but be LLVM is a critical part of the open source ecosystem.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.340
So we just wanted to keep you apprised.

04:14.340 --> 04:18.100
No, it's not the latest and greatest virtual machine manager.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.180
In fact, LLVM is not even an acronym.

04:21.180 --> 04:26.480
It's just the name of the project, which is a collection of modular and reusable compiler

04:26.480 --> 04:32.020
and tool chain technologies, been around now for 18 years, and started off as a research

04:32.020 --> 04:37.540
project at the University of Illinois, created by Chris Latner, initially focused on C and

04:37.540 --> 04:40.980
C++, but built the language agnostic design.

04:40.980 --> 04:47.180
Yeah, that modular and language agnostic design turned out to be a huge asset for the project.

04:47.180 --> 04:49.900
And today, it's just enormous.

04:49.900 --> 04:52.660
And it's not just in the open source community.

04:52.660 --> 04:57.860
LLVM has been an integral part of Apple's Xcode development tools for macOS and iOS

04:57.860 --> 04:59.460
since Xcode four.

04:59.460 --> 05:05.300
And this week, we got an update on their effort to relicense to what effectively will be an

05:05.300 --> 05:08.940
Apache 2.0 license but with an LLVM exception.

05:08.940 --> 05:13.460
That exception is just dealing with your code being compiled by LLVM as well as when pairing

05:13.460 --> 05:16.940
LLVM code with the GPL version two.

05:16.940 --> 05:21.980
Currently LLVM is published under the University of Illinois slash NCSA open source license,

05:21.980 --> 05:26.540
which is based on the MIT or X11 and three clause BSD licenses.

05:26.540 --> 05:28.260
Okay, got it.

05:28.260 --> 05:33.660
But to make this transition to Apache to clean, they need to collect the contributor signatures,

05:33.660 --> 05:37.260
the people that have contributed to the code over the years.

05:37.260 --> 05:42.180
And surprise, surprise, that is the sticky point right now, the LLVM Foundation has managed

05:42.180 --> 05:47.820
to get approval for more than 94% of the older code base and they're getting really close,

05:47.820 --> 05:54.300
but they need 100% to legally relicense it to Apache to a Google spreadsheet is being

05:54.300 --> 05:58.540
used to sort all this out and keep track of who they still need to communicate with so

05:58.540 --> 05:59.540
far.

05:59.540 --> 06:02.340
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

06:02.340 --> 06:06.700
The hope with this whole license change effort is to clear up the patent section of their

06:06.700 --> 06:11.460
former license that led to some unfortunate confusion and organizations not contributing

06:11.460 --> 06:15.900
to the project, as well as getting the runtime libraries and the rest of the code under the

06:15.900 --> 06:23.460
same unified license and clearing up the wording on the patent rights.

06:23.460 --> 06:29.020
In the land of farmers and fishermen in the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein,

06:29.020 --> 06:36.380
there is work afoot to switch 25,000 PCs to LibreOffice.

06:36.380 --> 06:41.420
The state wants to reduce its dependence on proprietary software and eventually end it

06:41.420 --> 06:42.420
all together.

06:42.420 --> 06:47.860
Yeah, the goal is by the end of 2026 to have replaced Microsoft Office with LibreOffice

06:47.860 --> 06:53.820
on all those 25,000 computers used by civil servants and other government employees, including

06:53.820 --> 06:54.820
teachers.

06:54.820 --> 06:58.180
Yeah, so that seems to kind of be like a phase one, and they're entertaining the idea of

06:58.180 --> 07:04.700
a phase two if that goes well, which would be switch the OSs from Windows to Linux.

07:04.700 --> 07:12.380
Now, I know some of us long timers are getting a solid sense of deja vu here, but I am encouraged

07:12.380 --> 07:15.340
by a few lessons that they seem to be applying here.

07:15.340 --> 07:20.580
One of the big ones is they're switching the applications first, getting the users familiar

07:20.580 --> 07:25.100
with the very same applications they would end up using on Linux before switching out

07:25.100 --> 07:26.300
the OS.

07:26.300 --> 07:27.940
Change the apps, then the platform.

07:27.940 --> 07:32.400
Yeah, I mean, that cuts the learning curve in half and is leveraging one of the great

07:32.400 --> 07:33.940
things about LibreOffice, right?

07:33.940 --> 07:35.500
It runs everywhere.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.740
That seems like a good thing to me.

07:37.740 --> 07:41.460
Another good sign that stood out is that they're not trying to do this just to save money.

07:41.460 --> 07:45.860
They're doing this to break out of a dependent vendor relationship, not even trying to do

07:45.860 --> 07:47.820
the transition on the cheap, which is good.

07:47.820 --> 07:50.820
It means you're actually willing to spend the money to try to make something like this

07:50.820 --> 07:51.820
effective.

07:51.820 --> 07:56.500
Additionally, it seems to me in conjunction with broader thinking about the government's

07:56.500 --> 08:01.780
use of open source and selecting services and software that support multiple operating

08:01.780 --> 08:02.780
systems.

08:02.780 --> 08:03.780
Yep.

08:03.780 --> 08:08.900
These are some of the changes that they're implementing compared to how Munich did it

08:08.900 --> 08:14.580
a decade ago that do make me want to be more positive.

08:14.580 --> 08:19.300
So that's nice to see, but what's underneath a lot of this is a new motivator, which I

08:19.300 --> 08:20.300
think is fascinating.

08:20.300 --> 08:24.540
So it's like before it was let's save money by using free software, but now the motivator

08:24.540 --> 08:27.820
seems to be more like we don't want to be locked into a vendor.

08:27.820 --> 08:32.220
And we're seeing this time and time again now, this theme for businesses and for governments

08:32.220 --> 08:35.460
is they don't want vendor lock-in.

08:35.460 --> 08:37.700
And that is a difference.

08:37.700 --> 08:38.700
I don't know.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.580
I can't help but be slightly skeptical.

08:40.580 --> 08:44.860
It was rough watching Munich over a decade just blow this thing where there were bad

08:44.860 --> 08:45.860
choices.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.320
You know, they rolled their own distro.

08:47.320 --> 08:49.500
There were politics.

08:49.500 --> 08:55.160
There were like Wolf of Wall Street style moves by Microsoft that really torpedoed this really

08:55.160 --> 08:57.020
public Linux switch.

08:57.020 --> 08:59.540
So it was really hard to watch that.

08:59.540 --> 09:00.940
But yeah, I agree, Wes.

09:00.940 --> 09:05.660
They seem to be taking a better, probably more practical strategy with it.

09:05.660 --> 09:10.060
Well, here's hoping the fishermen and farmers will have a better go at it anyway.

09:10.060 --> 09:13.980
And whenever government time and money is invested into free software, even if only

09:13.980 --> 09:17.900
temporarily, users all around the world benefit together.

09:17.900 --> 09:20.220
And that's great.

09:20.220 --> 09:21.940
Linode.com slash LAN.

09:21.940 --> 09:23.860
That's where we host everything up in the cloud.

09:23.860 --> 09:27.300
And I started using Linode before they were a sponsor because they had the best price

09:27.300 --> 09:28.680
to performance.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.580
They had a great interface.

09:30.580 --> 09:34.980
And I could tell after using it for a little bit, they were really Linux geeks and it was

09:34.980 --> 09:38.460
influencing the product in an absolutely great way.

09:38.460 --> 09:41.660
Now we're rounding into our second year of working with Linode.

09:41.660 --> 09:46.200
And it's been absolutely enabling for us as an independent business to not only survive

09:46.200 --> 09:50.060
because they are a fantastic client, but also they are where we run everything.

09:50.060 --> 09:52.460
We still choose to deploy everything in Linode.

09:52.460 --> 09:54.460
It gives us that fast performance.

09:54.460 --> 09:59.700
It gives us locations near you because they have 11 data centers around the world.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.940
They have the best API out there.

10:01.940 --> 10:05.020
It truly is a developer owned company.

10:05.020 --> 10:07.980
They have a 99.99% SLA.

10:07.980 --> 10:09.940
They're ready to work in a multi cloud environment.

10:09.940 --> 10:14.500
And when you compare Linode pricing, performance and features against the hypervisors that

10:14.500 --> 10:18.460
want to lock you into their proprietary platforms, Linode crushes it.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.580
The independent parties have verified it.

10:20.580 --> 10:22.540
Linode is the fastest provider out there.

10:22.540 --> 10:25.140
And especially when you look at price and performance.

10:25.140 --> 10:29.220
But they have brand new AMD EPYC dedicated CPU rigs if you want to go that way.

10:29.220 --> 10:31.980
They're rolling out new MVME storage to their systems.

10:31.980 --> 10:33.900
And of course, they're $5 systems.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.380
They're like budget focused systems are still incredibly powerful.

10:37.380 --> 10:42.580
I use that now for game servers and sync thing and all that all running on one $5 Linode.

10:42.580 --> 10:47.980
They really do stack up to the competition and I acknowledge there is a lot of ways to

10:47.980 --> 10:49.540
host something.

10:49.540 --> 10:52.460
But nobody does it like Linode, nobody.

10:52.460 --> 10:56.380
And on top of all of that, they have the best customer support in the business.

10:56.380 --> 10:59.660
By phone, ticket or social, they're gonna help you, they're gonna take care of any problem

10:59.660 --> 11:00.660
you have.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.080
And that means you can rest easy at night.

11:02.080 --> 11:05.460
And I do knowing that because that's where my business infrastructure runs.

11:05.460 --> 11:09.740
So go build something, go try something, go test something, push it to the limit, see

11:09.740 --> 11:13.860
what you can get and really kick the tires because Linode is going to give you $100 when

11:13.860 --> 11:16.620
you go to linode.com slash LAN.

11:16.620 --> 11:21.260
Go there to get that $100 in CCD credit on a new account and you support the show.

11:21.260 --> 11:22.260
It's a great deal.

11:22.260 --> 11:23.980
It's a great opportunity.

11:23.980 --> 11:27.700
Linode.com slash LAN.

11:27.700 --> 11:32.380
Linux.ting.com and thanks to Ting for making this episode of Linux Action News possible.

11:32.380 --> 11:38.280
Ting is my cell service of choice since 2013 and the trick is that Ting is an MVNO.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.920
So they're a virtual operator that runs on top of multiple carriers and they can focus

11:41.920 --> 11:46.380
on great deals and great customer service, not digging holes in the ground.

11:46.380 --> 11:51.780
So you get great connectivity and speed on LTE or 5G networks across the nation.

11:51.780 --> 11:53.780
And Ting has plans as low as $10 a month.

11:53.780 --> 11:55.860
You can dial in the plan that works just for you.

11:55.860 --> 12:00.220
A lot of data, a little data, unlimited calls, unlimited texts, you pick.

12:00.220 --> 12:05.340
Every plan has access to Ting's award-winning customer service and nationwide LTE and 5G.

12:05.340 --> 12:08.220
Plus the freedom of no contracts ever.

12:08.220 --> 12:09.220
Boom.

12:09.220 --> 12:12.280
Ting's been leading the industry on that.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.980
And the nice thing is it's so simple to switch to Ting, which means you can start saving

12:15.980 --> 12:17.380
money right away.

12:17.380 --> 12:18.940
Pretty much any phone's going to work.

12:18.940 --> 12:22.780
Just head to linux.ting.com, check out your current phone, create an account and pick

12:22.780 --> 12:23.960
the plan that's right for you.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.020
They're going to have one.

12:25.020 --> 12:28.600
Once everything checks out and Ting figures out exactly where your best service is going

12:28.600 --> 12:30.300
to be at, they'll send you a SIM card.

12:30.300 --> 12:34.100
You pop that into your phone and you get activated in minutes.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.640
It's a great way to get started.

12:35.640 --> 12:39.540
And then from then on, you're going to find just about everything you want in the dashboard.

12:39.540 --> 12:44.860
A customer since 2013, I've called customer service twice, both times because I was doing

12:44.860 --> 12:49.580
something crazy on a road trip and they stuck with me.

12:49.580 --> 12:50.580
They really did stick with me.

12:50.580 --> 12:52.740
I had a great experience and you will too.

12:52.740 --> 12:58.140
So get started and save $25 when you go to linux.ting.com that's right linux.ting.com

12:58.140 --> 13:05.560
see how much you could save and then take 25 bucks off that linux.ting.com

13:05.560 --> 13:09.580
Something rather big happened this week in the world of Linux and specifically Linux

13:09.580 --> 13:15.380
distributions, but you'd be easily forgiven if you didn't happen to notice.

13:15.380 --> 13:22.320
Amazon announced the release of Amazon Linux 2022 and well not typically a big event.

13:22.320 --> 13:25.100
This time things are a bit different.

13:25.100 --> 13:30.060
One of the major changes being that Amazon has rebased their Linux operating system on

13:30.060 --> 13:31.060
Fedora.

13:31.060 --> 13:36.680
That's a bit of a hybrid actually between select bits of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and

13:36.680 --> 13:39.180
a whole lot of that Fedora goodness.

13:39.180 --> 13:41.820
Now isn't that interesting thoughts on that in a moment.

13:41.820 --> 13:47.900
But what I noticed is Amazon seems to casually refer to this as AL 2022 and in the release

13:47.900 --> 13:53.940
notes they noticed that quote AL 2022 uses the Fedora project as its upstream to provide

13:53.940 --> 14:00.100
customers with a wide variety of the latest software such as uploaded language runtimes

14:00.100 --> 14:02.620
as part of quarterly releases.

14:02.620 --> 14:11.420
In addition AL 2022 has SE Linux enabled and enforced by default.

14:11.420 --> 14:15.820
Little round of a quiet applause there because I think that's really great on systems that

14:15.820 --> 14:17.580
are built for cloud workloads.

14:17.580 --> 14:22.300
Some other things that they're baking into their distribution include live kernel patching,

14:22.300 --> 14:26.260
extra kernel hardening they have details about that on the GitHub and they're basing it all

14:26.260 --> 14:29.940
on the 5.15 LTS kernel.

14:29.940 --> 14:32.900
And then there's the support window.

14:32.900 --> 14:37.100
Amazon is recommitting to major versions of the operating system every two years with

14:37.100 --> 14:40.140
five years of long term support.

14:40.140 --> 14:45.880
And much like Red Hat or Ubuntu but a bit abbreviated, there are two phases of support.

14:45.880 --> 14:49.660
Each release consists of standard support for two years and then a further three years

14:49.660 --> 14:51.500
of maintenance support.

14:51.500 --> 14:55.780
Each release receives quarterly minor version updates to provide security updates, bug fixes

14:55.780 --> 14:58.420
and perhaps new features.

14:58.420 --> 15:02.340
Yeah, that new features thing is going to be interesting to see how customers react

15:02.340 --> 15:04.180
to that long term.

15:04.180 --> 15:09.380
Because that combined with a Fedora base seems to really position this thing as aggressively

15:09.380 --> 15:10.380
close to upstream.

15:10.380 --> 15:14.940
I mean, this is pretty fresh for an enterprise distro quote unquote.

15:14.940 --> 15:20.420
And Amazon I think recognizes this in in their announcements and on their GitHub, they tout

15:20.420 --> 15:25.580
repository locking as an option for those that want something maybe a little less aggressive,

15:25.580 --> 15:30.920
writing on their GitHub quote, Amazon Linux 2022 gives customers control over how and

15:30.920 --> 15:37.140
when they choose updates and provides the ability to lock major and minor versions,

15:37.140 --> 15:41.160
as well as specific versions of your Amazon Linux repository.

15:41.160 --> 15:46.500
This enables you to ensure consistency of package versions and updates across your environment.

15:46.500 --> 15:51.220
I've got to be honest that when I'm choosing an OS to run on the cloud, it's not usually

15:51.220 --> 15:52.220
Amazon Linux.

15:52.220 --> 15:55.580
And of course, that's where you're going to see their distribution running on their cloud

15:55.580 --> 15:58.260
and AC two instances in particular.

15:58.260 --> 16:02.100
But it's so neat to see a new distribution come out that's based on Fedora.

16:02.100 --> 16:03.980
We just don't see that very often.

16:03.980 --> 16:08.540
I do agree that this seems perhaps aggressively upstream for the enterprise.

16:08.540 --> 16:12.100
But that's kind of exciting, because a lot of these sort of server districts have felt

16:12.100 --> 16:15.760
so stale for a long time that you maybe you chose something like a month or because it

16:15.760 --> 16:20.100
felt like it changed a little bit more often, just a little more fresh flavor.

16:20.100 --> 16:23.660
If you didn't need the years of support in a lockdown system.

16:23.660 --> 16:28.200
In some ways, it feels like Amazon's kind of trying out a new approach and a new part

16:28.200 --> 16:29.200
on the spectrum.

16:29.200 --> 16:34.660
Yeah, yeah, it's, it's a little more aggressive than say, going with sent off stream, because

16:34.660 --> 16:40.620
it's closer to that fedora base where stream is going to be a little more reserved, a little

16:40.620 --> 16:43.680
more careful in those updates.

16:43.680 --> 16:48.300
And so it's kind of sitting between that between fedora and between sent off stream.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.820
That's interesting, and would normally not be enough.

16:50.820 --> 16:54.540
But then you come in and say, Oh, by the way, five years of support to which has always

16:54.540 --> 16:58.460
been the Achilles heel of running fedora in production, and no one wants to upgrade those

16:58.460 --> 16:59.620
every nine months or so.

16:59.620 --> 17:04.980
But the other thing that's just casually nice about having a fedora server is you understand

17:04.980 --> 17:09.440
fedora 34 as a base or fedora 35, which is what they're ultimately shooting for.

17:09.440 --> 17:15.980
That as a base means XYZ features as a developer to build on in perhaps a sign of the times.

17:15.980 --> 17:18.980
It feels like they're almost leading this announcement with their arm release.

17:18.980 --> 17:23.040
I mean, yeah, sure, there's x86 as well, of course, but they're being quite prominent

17:23.040 --> 17:25.980
that those new processors running arm of theirs in their data centers.

17:25.980 --> 17:28.900
Yeah, of course, al 22 is going to be great on there.

17:28.900 --> 17:33.460
Yeah, it really is sort of the ultimate Amazon fantasy stack.

17:33.460 --> 17:39.900
You get you get an Amazon instance with an Amazon ARM processor running Amazon Linux,

17:39.900 --> 17:40.900
the whole thing.

17:40.900 --> 17:43.780
It's, I could see it working really well for some people.

17:43.780 --> 17:47.780
But this would be a lot more exciting to me if these eventually released as ISOs that

17:47.780 --> 17:51.100
I could install on any x86 or ARM system.

17:51.100 --> 17:52.540
No sign of that just yet.

17:52.540 --> 17:53.540
But we'll keep an eye on it.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.780
If it does happen, we'll let you know and we'll let you know about anything else that

17:55.780 --> 17:58.560
happens in the world of Linux and open source.
