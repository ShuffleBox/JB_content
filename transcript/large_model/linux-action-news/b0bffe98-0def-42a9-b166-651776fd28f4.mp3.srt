00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,660
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,460
This is episode 10 recorded on the 16th of July 2017.

3
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,460
I'm Joe.

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,680
And I'm Ryan.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,760
And Chris isn't here, he's on holiday.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,080
So we've asked Ryan to step in and thank you very much for doing that, Ryan.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,080
No problem.

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,600
I'm housed here at the System76 headquarters.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,000
And I've got everything set up my whole command center, three monitors, a mic, you know, it's

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,660
just I'm ready to go.

11
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,660
I'm ready and I'm willing.

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,660
Nice.

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,400
I was going to mention System76, but you just literally couldn't wait, could you?

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,400
No, no, of course.

15
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,220
Okay, well, let's start with Fedora 26, which has been released.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:01:01,880
And there's kind of a few not that exciting things like GCC 7, Golang 1.8, Python 3.6,

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,020
and loads of under the hood stuff.

18
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:13,320
But there's also a new GUI for partition editing in the installer called Blivit GUI, which

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,320
isn't that new.

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,080
It's been in the repo since Fedora 21.

21
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,420
But now it's kind of in the default live image.

22
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,760
So have you given Fedora 26 a go?

23
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,040
I haven't given Fedora 26.

24
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,680
I was using Fedora 25 for a while, just playing around seeing what was available there.

25
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,120
But I have not yet tried this out, although I probably will.

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:38,820
We played with it here a few times, especially since kind of, this will be later, but since

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,640
we started working on Popover at System76, we've been looking across the entire Linux

28
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,440
distribution landscape to see where people are doing things well and trying to emulate

29
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
that.

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,560
I'm really curious to see the partition manager.

31
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,480
I can't find any pictures of that.

32
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,360
And I tried looking earlier, too.

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:04,220
I'm not sure if I'm just missing the link in this release or what, but have you played

34
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,220
with it yet?

35
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,740
Yeah, well, I always would do the advanced partitioning because it's usually on a test

36
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,160
machine that's got several partitions.

37
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,800
And it looks pretty good.

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,920
But in terms of functionality, it was a bit lacking because I've got a logical partition

39
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,040
and it wouldn't, well, at least I couldn't see a way to enlarge that to add another partition

40
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
for Fedora.

41
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,520
So I had to put in one more primary and then that was the maximum number of partitions

42
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,600
for the disk.

43
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,080
So that means I'll have to delete Fedora if I want to install anything else.

44
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,920
So that wasn't great, but it looks good at least, but I'm used to using GParted basically.

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,000
It's that I would always do that, or even the partition editing in Ubiquity as well.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yeah.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,200
I was kind of just looking through the release notes here.

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,240
I think I remember last week, was it, Matt was talking on Linux Unplugged?

50
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,440
Yeah, he spoke quite a lot about it.

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,240
And to me, there's nothing hugely exciting about it, but in a way that's good to me.

52
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,080
I don't think huge changes are good, really.

53
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,720
I think that it sounds like steady improvements and just progression with new packages, new

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,760
kernel, that kind of thing, and a few features here and there, but nothing massively exciting.

55
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Right.

56
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:34,320
The thing I'd be most interested in seeing is if there are any changes to Wayland and

57
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,000
how it interacts with applications.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,160
I know that I've talked to Alberto Ruiz and some of the guys over at Red Hat about the

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,000
work that they've been putting into that effort, and I don't know if any of that was scheduled

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,960
to be in this release, but I just know that they've been putting a lot of time and effort

61
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,840
into Wayland and how that interacts with applications.

62
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,600
Right now you can't really do screen sharing in a Wayland session, and other things like

63
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,360
that, just little things that I'm wondering what the progress of that on.

64
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,560
I bet Fedora is a great way to keep up with that Wayland development and see what the

65
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,880
new and shiny is.

66
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,360
I definitely will have to pull it down and at least play around with the Wayland session

67
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:31,160
and see if anything has changed, because right now I use Wayland every day on my POP system

68
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,380
and for the most part it's pretty stable and it's a good experience, but there are little

69
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:44,120
tiny things that I'm hoping that are getting addressed and I want to see how they're implementing

70
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,440
it in Fedora and if that's any different.

71
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,040
Yeah, well Fedora really blazed the trail when it comes to Wayland, so I think you should

72
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,840
definitely check it out.

73
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,520
But another story that developed shortly after this was that there is a proposal by Justin

74
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:06,320
Forbes who's one of the Fedora kernel maintainers to drop the 32-bit kernel because essentially

75
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,960
hardly anyone is using it, hardly anyone is testing it, and it's just time for it to go

76
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
basically.

77
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,560
I have been skeptical, shall we say, about dropping 32-bit support in Linux, but I think

78
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,080
the time is coming and we've seen it with Arch, we've seen it with Tails, we've seen

79
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,680
it with various other distros.

80
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,160
Do we really need 32-bit support anymore?

81
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:38,120
Frankly, I have not used a 32-bit system for probably a couple years now, maybe longer.

82
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,360
Even in systems that are rocking 30 gigs of RAM, which I know isn't the only difference,

83
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,800
but I still have been throwing 64-bit on them.

84
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,520
So I don't know between myself and my family and my friends of anybody who's using a 32-bit

85
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,000
system, although now that I said that, probably my friends who are listening to this will

86
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,720
probably ping me and let me know that they are.

87
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,760
But if it's just a lot of extra work for them and they don't have people who are doing this

88
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:18,360
regularly enough people who can test out and make sure everything's working properly, then

89
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:25,440
it's better to drop it than to offer something that hasn't been thoroughly tested.

90
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,560
And maybe that's not the case, but based on kind of what's in this article, it seems like

91
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,720
there might be some problems with QA and maybe not enough of that happening.

92
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,840
And so I think that it might just be time.

93
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,280
And if somebody is really, really passionate about it, maybe they can pick that up and

94
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
take on that project.

95
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
Yeah.

96
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,660
I mean, the thing is on the desktop, it doesn't really make any sense anymore.

97
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,320
The only thing I would say is the 32-bit Atom machines, but even they're pretty long in

98
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:01,520
the tooth at this point, but I would say that with Atomic, Fedora Atomic, that might possibly

99
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,040
make sense to have a 32-bit version because if you've got a lot of VMs running and you

100
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,080
want them to be as small and lean as possible, then it might, there are some circumstances

101
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,680
where it would make sense to be 32-bit, but yeah, I think really that that's a pretty

102
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
edge case.

103
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,280
So yeah, I think it is time to move on from 32-bit now.

104
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,880
But let's move on and talk about Unity, or is it Unit, Y-U-N-I-T.

105
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,520
It's the worst name I've heard since pop underscore OS.

106
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:40,920
And so that is the fork or the continuation, I suppose you'd say, of Unity 8, which Canonical

107
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,840
famously dropped earlier this year.

108
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:53,920
And it is now available as an overlay repository for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, which I think is good

109
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:59,320
news for them because you need to start somewhere and the LTS seems like a very logical place

110
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,900
to start for me.

111
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,960
And I've tested it out and it didn't work very well at all, but you, as I say, you have

112
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
to start somewhere.

113
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:14,120
I don't have a great deal of faith in Unit or Unity as, well, as having a future put

114
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,160
it that way because without the great resources that Shotoworth brought to Canonical as a

115
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,240
community project, I just have to wonder who is really interested in Unity 8.

116
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,360
Yeah, I am patiently watching.

117
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,840
I'm in the Telegram channel as well.

118
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,120
I don't really have any feelings on it only because right now I'm not sure where this

119
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
project will end up.

120
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,320
Like when I think about people deciding on a distribution and on a desktop environment,

121
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,560
I don't know anyone beyond the people who are in that channel, you know, who are actively

122
00:08:52,560 --> 00:09:00,500
contributing to it, who have told me just in, you know, little Linux user groups around

123
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:06,840
and some of my friends who I talked to online, none of them have said, yeah, I really want

124
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,960
to give Unit a try.

125
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,400
Maybe that'll change now that these packages are available for the LTS, maybe, you know,

126
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,980
someone who's running that will pull it down and I might throw it on one of the test machines

127
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:24,240
here at the office just to look at it, but I'm just going to reserve judgment until I

128
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,820
see where the project goes and what their big overarching goals are.

129
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:36,680
The main thing is the applications that are built for Unity 8, I'll call it Unity 8 because

130
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,840
Unit is weird to me.

131
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:44,880
I'm worried that there won't be that many native applications beyond the core ones that

132
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,720
already exist and maybe I'm wrong, I could probably spend some time like looking through

133
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,640
their documentation and see if anybody's creating new applications for it, but I think as far

134
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:04,220
as interest goes, I think maybe at least among the developers I know who are developing applications

135
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:12,600
for it, a lot of their interest for developing native applications died along with Canonical's

136
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:20,080
backing of the project, but you know, they seem to be chugging along so I could prove

137
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,000
wrong in this and in a few months we might be talking more and more about the project,

138
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,820
but I think my honest opinion is I think we're looking at a known world for the foreseeable

139
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,820
future.

140
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,920
You would, wouldn't you, but yeah, I think that this and UbiPorts, now their community

141
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,640
efforts, I really want them to succeed, I want convergence to happen, I always wanted

142
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,920
it to happen when Canonical were paying to develop it, now it's out in the community,

143
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,720
I think it's probably going to take a lot longer, but it would be great to have a phone

144
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,260
that is a serious competitor to Android and have convergence working and have one device

145
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:05,840
that can have all my Linux desktop and phone needs taken care of, but yeah, I think we'll

146
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,480
be waiting a while for that, so here's hoping.

147
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,800
Yeah, if I was going to bet the farm on an alternative to Android, I'd be much, right

148
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,880
now at this very moment, I'd be much more comfortable saying that Sailfish would be

149
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,840
that before I would say Unit, but I know some of the guys working on it and they are driven

150
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,680
and, you know, they have a lot of passion for the project, so that's why I have to reserve

151
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,960
judgment because they could prove me wrong.

152
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,840
Yeah, here's hoping.

153
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,200
Well let's move on and talk about Ubuntu being in the Windows Store.

154
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,540
We've been talking on various Linux shows about the Windows subsystem for Linux for

155
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:54,640
a while now, and now Ubuntu is a Windows app, what kind of topsy-turvy bizarro world are

156
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,280
we living in when I can say that, that, you know, okay, you have to be enrolled in the

157
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,880
Windows Insiders program and you have to be on the latest build of Windows, but Ubuntu

158
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,480
is in the Windows App Store.

159
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,960
What is going on?

160
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:13,400
Honestly, I've been thinking about how I feel about this for ever since it was released

161
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,800
and I still don't know how I feel about it.

162
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:22,680
I can't determine whether this is a good thing or a bad thing or it doesn't matter.

163
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,400
I'm really curious to hear your thoughts because, I mean, I know this story is specific to it

164
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:33,280
being in the App Store, which is interesting in and of itself, but I had a very hard time

165
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:39,160
formulating an opinion on this specific feature in Windows.

166
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,000
Well I feel ambivalent, I think, I think most of us do because on the one hand there's a

167
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,840
chance that it's going to expose Windows users to Ubuntu and therefore Linux and therefore

168
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:54,600
free software and open source and all the rest of that and they might be using this

169
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,760
instead of Cygwin and therefore they might realize, hey, this Ubuntu thing is actually

170
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,080
pretty good, but it's not desktop.

171
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,360
They've never said it was going to be desktop.

172
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,080
I saw some people complaining in the reviews that X11 doesn't work.

173
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,000
Well it was never supposed to work.

174
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,800
You can hack it and make it work just about, so I read, but yeah, I kind of feel ambivalent

175
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,960
because I'd like that to be true, but I think the reality is it's more a case of people

176
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,440
who are dual booting because they have their games or some other stuff they need and they

177
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,280
don't really use the Ubuntu partition that often now basically don't have any need to

178
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,200
use the Ubuntu partition and so they can just go Windows full time and I think that's what

179
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,440
Microsoft's game is here.

180
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,520
I think you're right.

181
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:45,800
I think that, well, I remember talking to one of the guys on this project at OSCON I

182
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:53,600
think last year and I remember he was an Ubuntu user.

183
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,320
I found that pretty interesting.

184
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,440
He was working inside Microsoft, but he was using Ubuntu full time and this is obviously

185
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:10,120
just an anecdotal story of me talking to a guy, but he just found it really interesting

186
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:16,040
work and thought it was good all around for Linux because it exposes more people to Linux,

187
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:21,860
but listening to you raise the point that, yeah, there are going to be people who use

188
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:28,000
Linux and they feel like they need to be able to use that bash environment on Windows that

189
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,760
are going to simply stop dual booting because, you know, or although in those cases they

190
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,360
might have a virtual machine, but the point is that there's a chance that they might stop

191
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,600
dual booting because, hey, I've got it right here.

192
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
I've got everything I need.

193
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,560
I've got apt, I've got git, I've got SSH, it's all right here and that's all I needed.

194
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:56,780
The other side of it that's exciting though is that Linux is popular enough among developers

195
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:02,760
that this is something that Windows and Microsoft felt like they needed.

196
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't know how exactly that worked.

197
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,400
I think there was a blog post on it though from Justin Kirkland where it talked about

198
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:17,280
how they started talking about this, them being Microsoft and Canonical and ultimately

199
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,860
worked together on this.

200
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,520
If that came from Microsoft, that's really interesting.

201
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:28,920
That shows that they felt a distinct need to have a Linux user space in Windows for

202
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:34,960
certain types of customers and I think that would speak to what thinking is like inside

203
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:40,180
of Microsoft as far as courting those developer customers.

204
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:46,460
And so that is the more interesting side of the story I think, but I'm curious to see

205
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:53,880
if we have any people telling stories on their blog about using Ubuntu from the Windows store

206
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,080
and then becoming a full-time Ubuntu user, or if we see anything that's the opposite

207
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,360
of that.

208
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:07,560
I'm just really interested in seeing how this plays out.

209
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
DigitalOcean.com.

210
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,000
Sign up with the promo code, here's the thing, to get $10 credit.

211
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,120
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

212
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,520
easy way to spin up a cloud server and you can do so in 55 seconds and with prices starting

213
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,080
at only $5 per month, that means you can get two months free if you use the promo code,

214
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,080
here's the thing.

215
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,640
They've got data centers all over the world and they've got a great simple interface for

216
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,760
dealing with your droplets as they call them and they've got a great API as well if you

217
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
want to script it.

218
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,960
Loads of the JB infrastructure runs on DigitalOcean and I've been using it for years personally

219
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,120
and recently they've introduced high CPU droplets.

220
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,480
The thing is their standard CPUs are pretty powerful but now if you need that extra bit

221
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,360
of performance for your application then they've got Skylake and Broadwell Xeons for the absolute

222
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,920
maximum performance.

223
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,520
So whether you want just a small next cloud server or a hugely powerful Linux rig out

224
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,720
in the cloud, go to DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code, here's the thing, and get

225
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,940
$10 in credit to get you started.

226
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:17,560
As of July 13th, Aiki is working full time on Solus and that was his first day and he

227
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:24,800
posted to his Patreons thanking them for their support and frankly this is awesome.

228
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:35,120
Another person working on Linux full time is great and Aiki is such a smart dude that

229
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,880
I've been watching his stuff as well trying to see what's coming out of it that frankly

230
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:49,920
System76 can use and so I'm very proud that the community was able to come together and

231
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
do this for him.

232
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,520
Yeah we did talk about this I think four episodes ago on Linux Action News but Aiki's my friend

233
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,800
so I thought well Chris is the way I'll slip this one in again and as you say this is just

234
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,800
great news, he'd been pretty happy at Intel, well very happy actually and he'd learned

235
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:13,480
a lot but the time had come and now he's full time with it and Solus is a great distro and

236
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:20,200
the development has already just massively accelerated and so I think that this, he was

237
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,880
doing this as a part time job and now it's his full time job, it's going to mean great

238
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,000
things for Solus and as you say probably for the rest of the Linux community as well because

239
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,800
you've got Budgie and also there's a lot of the technicalities of the under the hood stuff

240
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:39,560
with Solus which I think a lot of the other distros could benefit from if they integrated

241
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,200
that stuff like the bulletproof boot and stuff like that.

242
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,440
So if you do want to help him out check out patreon.com slash solus and throw him a few

243
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,440
bucks a month.

244
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:56,360
Yeah and I wanted to add to that, I've heard some people say like oh you know another project

245
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:03,000
we don't need this blah blah blah but none of this happens in a bubble you know I just

246
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,160
from personal experience working in a Linux company, a Linux focused company, when these

247
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,400
projects are around we never knock them here because we're always looking at okay how is

248
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,680
this project doing this you know and if there's something great happening there then the rest

249
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:25,040
of the community can adopt that and you know contribute to that and it just makes Linux

250
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,640
as a whole better so if you're interested in seeing what they're what what Ike's up

251
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,560
to and what the project is up to you know check out its github and throw them a few

252
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,280
bucks if you can because it'll ultimately benefit everyone and I say that about Solus

253
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:44,320
I say that about elementary I say that about Abuja Mate you know we're we're all a rising

254
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,880
tide right raises all ships so yeah supporting these guys really does make the Linux desktop

255
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
as a whole better.

256
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:58,200
Yeah okay well let's talk about a Linux desktop with which you are intimately familiar there's

257
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,640
been an update this week from System76 who are they on pop exclamation mark underscore

258
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,160
OS now from the blog post it says of the GNOME work that you guys have been doing CalDAV

259
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,860
and CardDAV work continues but the deeper we've dug the more hard coding we've found

260
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:20,460
now that is something that concerns me concerns me and I've heard that concern from a lot

261
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:26,360
of people you guys have taken on a big big challenge here to create your own distro even

262
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,240
though it's based on Ubuntu and basically Ubuntu GNOME and it's not that different at

263
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,560
the moment but you have taken on a lot and it seems that you are slowly realizing that

264
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,640
fact.

265
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,880
I think we realized it from the get-go we talked to a lot of projects before we jumped

266
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,000
in for instance we're really close to the elementary guys and so we had conversations

267
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,320
about what we wanted to do especially with GNOME online accounts which is what we're

268
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,880
talking about here and so we already had set aside some resources for this specifically

269
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:01,520
with GNOME contacts and GNOME calendar and Geary and those applications that should be

270
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,560
using the evolution data server and sharing you know this information in many cases they've

271
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:14,560
implemented how they talk to GNOME online accounts slightly different and so I don't

272
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:21,360
think that it's really unexpected that we have to do a bit of work I guess it is kind

273
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:29,400
of surprising that there wasn't a single implementation for this type of stuff across these applications

274
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,880
but we have one of our engineers David working on this pretty essentially full-time right

275
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,120
now and so he's going through and doing a lot of plumbing on this we've also teamed

276
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,400
up with elementary they've been making a big push with Pantheon Mail to implement the evolution

277
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,920
data server in Pantheon Mail and so we're looking to see how they're doing that and

278
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,960
talking to them about where we can work together to kind of do some of this plumbing and in

279
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:02,360
shared applications okay and also this installer situation it seems that you guys are not a

280
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,320
fan of Ubiquity which is by far my favorite installer and you don't like one specific

281
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,640
bit of it which is the bit that I really like and that is that it's very linear you stick

282
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,520
all your information into it it finishes reboot done login start using it whereas the GNOME

283
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,640
way to do things by default is to do a little bit upfront and then once you boot it for

284
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,640
the first time then you put in things like your locale and username and passwords and

285
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,980
all that kind of stuff I don't know why you don't just use the OEM installer quite frankly

286
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:42,680
because that is it you know that does it for you yeah we do use the OEM installer the OEM

287
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,720
installer still prompts you to do some things in Ubiquity that we decided should be in GNOME

288
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,760
initial setup for instance I remember when we started this conversation it actually started

289
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,040
because of the Ubuntu mailing list and they were saying there are things in Ubiquity that

290
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:04,600
you do that you then end up doing in GNOME initial setup and that's really quite weird

291
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:11,360
and so because even the first time I did it I was like why am I filling out this information

292
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,280
twice so we were having conversations and at first we were actually on the opposite

293
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:24,600
side we were talking to the to Jeremy Beecher and we're saying why isn't this all in Ubiquity

294
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:31,000
and then over time as we played around with GNOME initial setup more we decided oh wait

295
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,120
okay so let's say that you create a new user you could run them through some of this GNOME

296
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,600
initial setup stuff so that they can set up things specifically on their account like

297
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,800
for instance if they do want a different keyboard layout or something they as a user can set

298
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:53,880
that up specifically and then as we went further down that path we realized well Ubiquity could

299
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,040
be paired back to where it's only handles things that are specific to an installation

300
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:05,860
of a machine and then on first boot a person can set up the rest of their stuff through

301
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,080
initial setup and it just seemed as we played around with it more it seemed like a better

302
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:16,040
user experience and so because you might have like in the case of me installing something

303
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:20,680
for someone else I might install do some complicated partitioning or whatever and then hand that

304
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:26,120
off to a friend or a family member and then when they go through a new GNOME initial setup

305
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,160
they're setting up the things that they understand and that they're ready to do and so I feel

306
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:37,520
like it had to go one way or another you know because inputting the same information twice

307
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:44,840
during setup being installation and setup seems strange and frankly I don't know doesn't

308
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,680
really make much sense because you're like oh you already have the information why don't

309
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:56,980
you just skip this and so it had to go one way or another and it seems like the proper

310
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:03,200
way is to have the installer handle installer specific stuff have the GNOME initial setup

311
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,240
handle the user configuration stuff and I think we found a fine line there and I think

312
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,280
that that's probably the best way to go.

313
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:18,360
Fair enough I disagree but I can see the arguments for it so yeah okay so let's wrap it up with

314
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:24,400
Beaker and reading from a motherboard article here the concept behind Beaker is similar

315
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,280
to torrent file sharing a user can create a site on their local machine by opening menu

316
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,160
and clicking a single button which creates a folder on the hard drive that can be shared

317
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,060
over the internet with other Beaker users via URL.

318
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:44,840
So this is a browser that aims to completely decentralize the web now you could say well

319
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,600
the web is supposed to be decentralized anyway isn't it it already is why do we need this

320
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:56,400
extra thing and the argument is that you've got things like AWS and as you're and you've

321
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:03,280
got centralization happening so I mean the technicalities of this I don't think we need

322
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,200
to get into it's pretty cool I've tried it out you do have to build it from you have

323
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,420
to clone the git repository and build it it's not too difficult to do it this is clearly

324
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:19,160
just for developers at this stage it's not for consumers but for me the what's interesting

325
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:25,180
is the concept here of a decentralized web do we need it more decentralized than it is

326
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,840
I don't know I'm struggling to see the argument really.

327
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:35,480
So on ironically on motherboard there's a documentary a short documentary I think it's

328
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:42,320
like 20 or 30 minutes long that features my friend Isaac he was working on at Occupy Wall

329
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:49,480
Street and it's covered pretty well there he talks about you know how the web is a lot

330
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:56,760
more centralized than it once was and how when it comes to things like things that companies

331
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,480
may not feel comfortable with being on the web it's very easy to shut them down even

332
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,680
if they're just a instance of free speech or whatever you know not necessarily anything

333
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:14,380
criminal and that got me thinking more about this back that was in 2012 that we started

334
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:21,360
talking about this and so I've used zero net I've used I can't remember the name of the

335
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,960
other one there's another popular one now that's you know part of this decentralized

336
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,320
web push I haven't used beaker but I have seen it before I've seen the project page

337
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,840
I think I think honestly this is moving the world in the positive direction I don't like

338
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:44,920
the idea of like any good Linux user I suppose I don't like the idea of losing out on on

339
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:50,920
my my freedom because some company says that this doesn't meet their content policy or

340
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:57,480
or you know you could have AWS say we don't want this hosted on our servers whatever and

341
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,920
it could be not necessarily like I said criminal or anything it's just something that they

342
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,840
don't want to have to to defend you know like when someone says like why do you host that

343
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:13,080
on your infrastructure so I think this is ultimately good and as a positive thing for

344
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:18,280
for free speech I as far as like which one of these projects will raise rise above the

345
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:24,160
rest this looks cool zero net looks cool they all look cool I don't like them being browser

346
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:29,840
specific though and I don't think zero net is but you have to run like a script and and

347
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,120
you have to I think you might have to use Firefox but I would rather just have it be

348
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,800
something that you can access well that's the thing there's a huge barrier to entry

349
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,520
at the moment and you have to be very technical to do it the idea of normal people using this

350
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,840
stuff is it feels a long way off and that to me is what we need to crack it's all one

351
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:54,260
and good to have it in a nice technical implementation that works well if you know what you're doing

352
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,880
but it needs to be as simple as open Chrome type in address or Google search the thing

353
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,120
that you're looking for an open up website right right I agree 100% I think that will

354
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:11,520
be the barrier I could see this being really helpful for journalists too and I say that

355
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,440
in a more broad sense you know people who are covering things that that a government

356
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,800
or company may not want out in the open and so I think ultimately it's a net good for

357
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,680
technology and society but yeah the barrier to entry is pretty high and some of the people

358
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:32,320
who would benefit most from this may be among those users who find it difficult to set this

359
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,320
up and get started that's something they'll have to be overcome before this really takes

360
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:44,280
