00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,780
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 223, recorded on January 12th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,840
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,840
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,840
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,640
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,520
And we start this week with some big news for what just might be my least favorite desktop

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,520
Linux installer.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,120
Yes, that's right.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,920
Red Hat has announced it's planning to shift the Fedora and RHEL installer to a web-based

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,920
UI.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,160
Now, if you're familiar with Anaconda, you'll know that it's long been based on GTK.

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:42,040
But as part of some ongoing modernization efforts, it seems that Red Hat is actually

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,160
looking at rewriting the UI on top of Cockpit.

14
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,600
Yeah, Cockpit, or I think it's known as Web Console in RHEL, but we frequently refer

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,240
to it as Cockpit, which is a web-based management system that's cross-distro, but really has

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,160
a home in Fedora.

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,120
And it turns out it already knows a little Anaconda D-Bus.

18
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
We'll get to that.

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,540
But it seems that this is an effort that has been under consideration for a little bit.

20
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,320
And it's all in the really early stages of development.

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,080
And the transition actually isn't expected to be that disruptive, because there has been

22
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,360
an ongoing modularity effort in Anaconda.

23
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,040
And there is that D-Bus component.

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,920
So they think there's going to be kind of a smooth transition.

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:34,280
Now, honestly, the Anaconda installer, like Wes alluded to, has been probably our most

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,680
mixed aspect of the Fedora reviews over the years.

27
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,760
And whenever we have somebody new try Fedora, like they're either a big fan of Anaconda

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,680
or they don't like it at all.

29
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,760
Yeah, I don't think you can be neutral on Anaconda, at least not yet.

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:55,480
No, I think it's probably some of the most feedback the team receives as well.

31
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,600
Cockpit is an interesting choice.

32
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,760
So why cockpit?

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,200
Well, I think, one, they're pretty happy with how the project has turned out.

34
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,920
It's a mature solution.

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,120
And it already has support for that Anaconda D-Bus back end.

36
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,560
And I think another factor is the cockpit team is willing to engage and work with the

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
Fedora team.

38
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,440
I mean, that matters.

39
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,160
And they have expertise that the Fedora team can leverage for this transition, and it seems

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,760
they've even been willing to help build out a bit of a prototype to test this.

41
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,280
I mean, a really early stages kind of thing.

42
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,920
And they've been really good about communicating things.

43
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
That matters a lot when you're trying to make a transition like this.

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,840
But I think long term, it's probably also a little strategic.

45
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:45,440
It's about creating a consistent management experience for Fedora, the Fedora spins and

46
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,640
RHEL, and now just like you're going to manage your virtual machines and your disks and you're

47
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,760
going to manage your packages and your updates and your services through cockpit, now you're

48
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,840
also going to do the installation through cockpit.

49
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,320
And if you think of it in an enterprise environment where you might already be doing it through

50
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,680
some sort of remote session, God forbid VNC, which is like the go to solution right now,

51
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,360
this is going to be a way better experience.

52
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,160
And for those of us who do the occasional install, I don't think I'm going to hate this

53
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,960
as much as I might have a couple of years ago.

54
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,960
You know what I mean, Wes?

55
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,480
Like, I think I see the logic here.

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Yeah, there's definitely some advantages to having it be a web based UI.

57
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,300
I mean, the web is pretty universal at this point.

58
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,680
But I do wonder how it might work exactly.

59
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,280
I mean, is this going to be just a tiny little GNOME web embedded instance?

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,880
How might it work in what might in the old days be more of a, you know, just a low key

61
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,920
minimal terminal install, are we going to have those kinds of options?

62
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,060
But that said, if you think about this as sort of lifting up some of the abstractions

63
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,200
in the system, building more API's, making things more modular, as they have been working

64
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,360
on in the back end of Anaconda, I think that's a really good thing, right?

65
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,960
I mean, this is going to make cockpit more robust, it's going to let the team working

66
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,080
on Anaconda maybe focus a little bit more on the specific implementation details and

67
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,880
a little less on the presentation stuff, especially if that's, you know, partially being handled

68
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,720
by the nice framework that cockpit already has set up.

69
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,920
But as nice as that may potentially be, you can't get too excited just yet.

70
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,360
Because at the current state, they can't really commit to anything on when you might actually

71
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,200
get to try this out.

72
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,960
So far, we don't even have a screenshot.

73
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,280
And popping up the stack a bit, there's a lot of good work going into GNOME Shell and

74
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,100
Mudder, which is the Wayland display server or X11 compositing manager for GNOME.

75
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,280
And this is all intending to land in the 42 release.

76
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,160
Now it looks like on the Mudder side, we're seeing a bunch of notable updates, some of

77
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,400
which are allowing the input events to happen at a full rate.

78
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,240
We've talked about that before, rather than being limited to the monitor refresh rate.

79
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,280
So if you had a 60 hertz screen, that was the absolute max that GNOME was allowing input

80
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,860
events to be captured at.

81
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,440
And some applications, like 3D applications, video editors and video games, were sitting

82
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,000
there pulling, waiting for more.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's fixed now.

84
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's going to be nice.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,480
That's a big change for a professional desktop.

86
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,420
Yeah, and great for those on like, say, 120 hertz monitors.

87
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,420
That's really nice.

88
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,360
Also, nice to see support for the Wayland DMA buffer back end extension, which gives

89
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,120
you improved multi GPU support and direct scan out handling.

90
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
Hey oh!

91
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,280
And speaking of improvements in that area, Mudder will now prefer GBM over EGL streams.

92
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,480
Now why that matters is because that's how you get the NVIDIA proprietary driver working

93
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
on Wayland.

94
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,600
And that now is set to default to prefer GBM.

95
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,800
Well, even outside of Mudder, GNOME 42 has some other nice to see improvements, including

96
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,880
better window tracking, support for extensions being able to opt in to running on the lock

97
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,800
and login screens, and some efficiency improvements in the screen magnifier, which has now learned

98
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,080
to be better at avoiding off-screen rendering.

99
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,600
Following this alpha, GNOME 42 beta is expected sometime mid-February, with plans for an official

100
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,600
release on March 23rd.

101
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,920
We don't mention every release of Linux Mint, but this one seemed like a particularly good

102
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
one.

103
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:35,620
Linux Mint 20.3 has been released, and this one has security updates until 2025.

104
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:40,380
New in this release is dark mode, as the team says is now omnipresent throughout the apps

105
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,920
and the UI, giving a more coherent user experience.

106
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,880
They've introduced a new document manager called Thingy, think of it as like a library

107
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,200
that keeps track of your documents on your computer and how far you've read.

108
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,960
It's pretty nice looking too.

109
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,600
Themes have been refreshed and modernized in this release.

110
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,960
And of course, Mint 20.3 features Cinnamon 5.2 along with some other desktops, but Cinnamon

111
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,240
5.2 has gotten some nice work.

112
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,000
And the integrated calendar now has event management functionality, and it syncs with

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,540
potential calendar sources like Evolution, Google Calendar, Mozilla Thunderbird and whatnot

114
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,800
right there in your little clock area.

115
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,360
It looks great.

116
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,180
That's pretty nice to see.

117
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:33,280
Under the hood, Linux Mint 20.3 is powered by Linux kernel 5.4, building on top of the

118
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,940
Ubuntu 20.04 base.

119
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,560
And for you Flatpak users, it's got Flatpak 1.12.

120
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,600
Also in the news for Linux Mint recently, it seems they've reached a deal with Mozilla

121
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,720
to have the project directly package Firefox for Mint.

122
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,280
Mint founder Clement Lefebvre wrote, quote, in the past, Linux Mint used its own default

123
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,080
settings and configured Firefox in a specific way.

124
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,080
Most of this configuration is now abandoned to go back to the Mozilla defaults.

125
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,980
Yep, no more Mint homepage.

126
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,860
It's the way Mozilla does it.

127
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:17,280
So among the changes, search engines will be back to the Mozilla default, which means

128
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,120
Google, not DuckDuckGo like it was before.

129
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,200
And it also means that any other kind of small patches they made, say, like to the devs that

130
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:32,080
Ubuntu made, those are being dropped now because it's just going to be as Mozilla ships it.

131
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,040
Adding a little additional background, Clem went on to say, quote, for Mozilla, the goal

132
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:44,080
is to make Firefox work the same way across all platforms, to ease maintenance and simplify

133
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,160
development and bug fixing.

134
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,860
For us, this change means a tremendous simplification in terms of maintenance and our development.

135
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:00,120
Two additional points of interest here, one, Clem also seemed to imply that avoiding using

136
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,840
the snap of Firefox was also a major motivation here.

137
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,640
And two, if you've already made changes to these default settings, well, we'll respect

138
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,640
that.

139
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,120
That's not going to get wiped out.

140
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:27,720
And if you're just relying on the defaults, then you're going to see some changes.

141
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,360
Linode really offers you something better for developers, for businesses, for individuals,

142
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,400
for those of you who just don't want the complexities of those big hyperscalers out there, and you

143
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,160
don't need their endless options, but you still want a great price and you want better

144
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
performance.

145
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,440
Linode's how we run everything.

146
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,260
Everything that we've built in the last 2.5 years now, it runs on Linux.

147
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,520
And I noticed right when I first tried Linode, you can tell in the product that the company

148
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,760
gets and loves Linux.

149
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,260
They use it every day in their own environment, and it shows in their tooling.

150
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,600
It's done really, really well.

151
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:09,480
They started 18 years ago, and now they are the largest independent cloud provider in

152
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
the world.

153
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,680
And they learned that customer support is absolutely critical.

154
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,800
So they've invested in having the best customer support in the business.

155
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,420
And to round that out, they have 11 data centers around the world for you to choose from, great

156
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,200
features like object storage, cloud firewall, a beautiful interface, backups that are simple

157
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,700
and reliable, and a lot more.

158
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,080
So go build something, go learn something, and try it for yourself while supporting the

159
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,080
show.

160
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,240
Linux.com slash LAN.

161
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,000
Get that $100 in 60 day credit and kick the tires for yourself.

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,920
Linode.com slash LAN.

163
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,760
And a big thank you to Ting, Linux.ting.com.

164
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,520
Go to Linux.ting.com and see how much you could save on cell service.

165
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,340
And then take $25 off that, either your service or a device, Linux.ting.com.

166
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:59,580
You see, Ting doesn't have to worry about making all the deals with the local governments

167
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,220
and digging holes in the ground.

168
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,520
They're a mobile virtual network operator.

169
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,240
So that means Ting gets access to the same nationwide networks, LTE and 5G, but they

170
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,300
can offer a better value and better customer support than the big duopolies can.

171
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,120
And Ting has that nationwide coverage.

172
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,640
They have a mix of plans and fast data.

173
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,240
So go to Linux.ting.com and see what works in your area.

174
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,840
It's a smart move too, because not only are you going to save, but Ting Mobile was recently

175
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,840
named the number one carrier by customer reports in 2021.

176
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,040
Congratulations Ting, and their plans are simple and straightforward.

177
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,040
Very easy to understand.

178
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,160
I appreciate about them.

179
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,000
That's why I've been there since 2013.

180
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You just look at the plans.

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,280
They make sense.

182
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,160
You can tell it's a good deal.

183
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,860
It's all really obvious.

184
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,860
It's really simple.

185
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,000
I really appreciate that.

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,560
And really, you know, when they can, they're just going to give you unlimited.

187
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,600
That helps keep it simple.

188
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,200
Like you can get plans that have unlimited talk and text, and if you're a family that,

189
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,680
you know, calls each other and text, what a great way to do a family plan.

190
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,720
And every single plan gets access to Ting's award-winning customer service with nationwide

191
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,360
LTE and 5G coverage, and the freedom of no contracts ever.

192
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,580
I love that.

193
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,120
And it's so simple to switch to Ting.

194
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,920
Pretty much any phone will work because of their multi-network support.

195
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,360
So just head to Linux.ting.com, check your current phone, create an account, and pick

196
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,800
the plan that's right for you.

197
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Ting will send you a SIM card.

198
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
You're going to pop that in.

199
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,960
You'll be going in minutes.

200
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,720
You're never going to be happier than when you start saving money.

201
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,960
It feels great, and why not do it at the beginning of the year?

202
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,480
I've been on a savings rampage recently, and Ting is absolutely one of the ways I get

203
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,480
there.

204
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,480
Linux.ting.com.

205
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,100
Giving us flashbacks of Linux's early days, former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey is helping

206
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:52,720
to launch a new fund that's aiming to help defend Bitcoin developers against potential

207
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,960
litigation.

208
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,400
His first port of call will be to come to the aid of the Bitcoin developers who are

209
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:04,280
being sued by Craig Wright's Tulip Trading Limited over an alleged, quote, breach of

210
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,480
fiduciary duty.

211
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,060
To start with, the fund will be providing funding for outside counsel.

212
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,920
It seems like this came just at the right time.

213
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,720
The email that Jack Dorsey sent out to the Bitcoin developer mailing list went out this

214
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,920
morning, and Dorsey described the open source community as, quote, especially susceptible

215
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,540
to legal pressure.

216
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:32,040
He wrote, in response, we propose a coordinated and formalized response to help defend developers.

217
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,360
So Craig Wright claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto.

218
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,240
Now in my personal opinion, and just about the opinion of everyone online, he is not

219
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,320
actually Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin.

220
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,960
That's what you said about me as well.

221
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,760
I think you're just a skeptic.

222
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:52,400
I'll tell you what, hand on my heart, there's a better shot that Wes Payne is Satoshi Nakamoto

223
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,320
than Craig Wright, in my personal opinion.

224
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,320
Because Craig doesn't even seem to understand how Bitcoin works.

225
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:05,840
What Craig wants is, and this is my understanding, but it seems he had coins from Mt. Gox.

226
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,520
Perhaps he came into possession of these coins after they circulated in the market when they

227
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,040
were stolen.

228
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,520
That part is not clear to me.

229
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,440
However, he has a large amount of coins that he then lost.

230
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,360
And he wants the Bitcoin developers to alter the Bitcoin source code to give him his key

231
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,360
back.

232
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,760
He thinks it's their responsibility.

233
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,840
He thinks he's found a law that makes it their responsibility to help him recover his lost

234
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
keys.

235
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,840
I'm sure anybody who's ever lost some Bitcoin would love the developers to do this.

236
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,080
But clearly, if Craig was Satoshi Nakamoto, he would know that you can't just change the

237
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,800
source code and have that get adopted.

238
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,000
Every node operator would also have to update their node and accept these changes.

239
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,480
This has happened in Bitcoin's history before when they tried to go to a larger block size

240
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,680
and the nodes played a role in rejecting that change.

241
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,240
So even if the source code could be changed, it wouldn't necessarily roll out.

242
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,300
The network wouldn't have consensus.

243
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,600
It wouldn't matter.

244
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,080
But I'm sure Craig knows that since he's Satoshi Nakamoto.

245
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Also Craig is going after anyone who has posted a copy of Satoshi Nakamoto's original white

246
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,700
paper about Bitcoin because he claims it's copyright infringement since he is Satoshi.

247
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,360
He wrote the white paper.

248
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,600
Anyone who is linked to it or posted online is committing copyright violations and he's

249
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,320
going after them or at least a select group.

250
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,720
Now, in my opinion, that just seems ridiculous as well because it's an open source project

251
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,540
and the white paper is meant to be widely distributed.

252
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:40,600
So the whole thing seems like a pretty loose understanding of how all of these things work

253
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,320
and not likely going to go very far.

254
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,800
But in the meantime, he's going to burn a lot of money and he's going to cause a lot

255
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,720
of developers a lot of heartburn.

256
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,800
And that's why it's pretty great that Jack Dorsey is trying to get this rolling to help

257
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
shield them from that.

258
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,320
Because I don't think it's just this, Wes.

259
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,040
It's like any future litigation related to Bitcoin based projects.

260
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,320
Dorsey even made mention of people working on lightning network apps.

261
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,040
Yeah, whatever you may think of this particular example, it does seem to be highlighting a

262
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,320
need as we see for other open source efforts that without someone helping on the monetary

263
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,360
front on the organizational front, well, sometimes these projects just aren't set up in a way

264
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,360
that can interface well with various legal systems.

265
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,560
Back to some of the nitty gritty on the fun side, well, initially it's going to be staffed

266
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,200
by volunteers and part time lawyers.

267
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,120
And there'll be a board responsible for allocating the resources.

268
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,560
Who's going to be on that board?

269
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,400
Well, Jack Dorsey, of course.

270
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:42,680
But also Chain Code Labs co-founder Alex Morkos and academic Martin White clarifying the fund's

271
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:48,800
financial position to start with, Dorsey wrote, quote, at this time, the fund is not seeking

272
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,680
to raise additional money for its operations, but will do so at the direction of the board

273
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,520
if needed for further legal action or to pay for staff.

274
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:05,360
Hmm, I was struck when I read this and I read into what Craig Wright is attempting to do.

275
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,360
I think you mean Satoshi Nakamoto, Chris?

276
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,360
Oh, right.

277
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
Sorry.

278
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,360
Of course.

279
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Right.

280
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,640
In my opinion, Craig Wright, or also a.k.a.

281
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,720
Satoshi Nakamoto, anybody who's been in Linux for a long time remembers SCO and just the

282
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,920
disproportional amount of FUD that small company could produce about Linux, IP and their supposed

283
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,040
ownership over components in Linux that made it so successful.

284
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,680
And they fought and they fought and they they tried going after projects and developers.

285
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,400
They tried going after companies.

286
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,720
They even ultimately eventually tried to go after end users of Linux for a little bit

287
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,320
in an embarrassingly desperate move.

288
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,280
And there's so many echoes of that kind of maybe actually echoes isn't the right word.

289
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,360
There's a lot of ways this rhymes with history.

290
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,560
What's happening right now as Bitcoin becomes successful, somebody is trying to use the

291
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,160
legal system to gain control and ownership over it to make money.

292
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,320
And their position seems tenuous from the best, even from the very beginning.

293
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,920
But that doesn't preclude them from doing years of legal battles.

294
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,080
And so Jack Dorsey stepping down from Twitter might have been one of the better things for

295
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,600
Bitcoin recently.

296
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,720
And this is a great first start.

297
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,680
But my opinion, I think what would be even better long term is actually something that's

298
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,400
maybe decentralized that the community could fund, because I think there's a lot of Bitcoin

299
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,940
users that would stop hodling a little bit of Bitcoin and come out of the woodwork and

300
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:33,680
contribute to a fund to go after creeps like Craig, in my opinion, that are going after

301
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
developers.

302
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,440
And that kind of thing has to be stopped.

303
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,320
And it's better for the entire Bitcoin community if it's stopped right now and early.

304
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah, you got to wonder, you know, this is focused on Bitcoin, but are other cryptocurrency

305
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
communities and projects in the space going to fall under its arena?

306
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,720
Or will they need their own organizations?

307
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,500
And yeah, as you say, you know, there are various approaches here.

308
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,440
But this seems like adding in a bit more centralization, at least in some regards, how well is this

309
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,420
board going to serve that community, I can definitely see where the community might want

310
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,400
something a little more decentralized and autonomous.

311
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,960
But perhaps this can be a good way to bootstrap things.

312
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah, and I think you make a good point to like, where does this leave the other cryptocurrencies?

313
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,360
Does it make them more legally exposed if they don't have a war chest standing by?

314
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:24,960
Wes, do you recall when there was a patent lawsuit going around, I think it involved

315
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,160
essentially using a playlist on a website.

316
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,360
It's a vague recollection, but this was a thing a few years ago.

317
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,360
Yeah, that sounds familiar.

318
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,880
And it really was a matter of the person doing the litigation in that scenario started with

319
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,560
a few low hanging fruits, small operations, and then won the case there and then built

320
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,000
on top of that and built on top of that.

321
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,120
And you do wonder if maybe something like that could end up happening in the cryptocurrency

322
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
world.

323
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,480
But this is all part of a brave new frontier, Linux had to go through these same exact growing

324
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
pains.

325
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,200
Yeah, it certainly seems like early days, both in the crypto space, and of course, for

326
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,760
this new fund, seems like we should be hearing more from them as the ball gets rolling sometime

327
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,760
soon.

328
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,960
And it is probably worth mentioning just one more time that, no, they're not looking for

329
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
money.

330
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,840
They've got enough of that, at least for now.

331
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,520
Well, we're going to keep the ball rolling right here every single week.

We're posting some special road trip memory episodes.

336
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,160
We kept the mics rolling during our trip to Denver, and we're putting some of the best

337
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,360
audio in extras.show releases.

338
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,320

news.
