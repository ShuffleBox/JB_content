00:00.000 --> 00:08.960
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 192, recorded on June 6th, 2021.

00:08.960 --> 00:09.960
I'm Chris.

00:09.960 --> 00:10.960
And I'm Wes.

00:10.960 --> 00:12.240
Hello, Wes.

00:12.240 --> 00:14.480
It's good to be back in the studio with you.

00:14.480 --> 00:15.560
Let's do the news.

00:15.560 --> 00:19.240
We start this week with some fundamentals.

00:19.240 --> 00:26.200
The Grand Unified Bootloader, better known as GRUB, recently added backup and restore

00:26.200 --> 00:28.280
functionality.

00:28.280 --> 00:33.800
What does that mean, well, as it stands right now, the very first thing GRUB install does

00:33.800 --> 00:40.360
when you're getting GRUB set up is pretty much wipe out whatever install you had before.

00:40.360 --> 00:42.880
That's bad news if something goes wrong.

00:42.880 --> 00:48.120
So after this change, GRUB will first back up whatever modules and other config and settings

00:48.120 --> 00:51.600
and important GRUB bits are there, then install.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.720
And if something goes wrong, it's able to restore from that backup.

00:54.720 --> 00:58.560
So don't worry if the install goes right, it cleans up afterwards.

00:58.560 --> 01:02.000
Hmm, this seems like a pretty essential feature.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.880
And also this week, you XFS file system users got some features in GRUB.

01:07.880 --> 01:13.400
GRUB now understands the recent XFS flag for marking file systems that need repair.

01:13.400 --> 01:18.040
And it will also print a debug message for the user so you know what's going on.

01:18.040 --> 01:22.360
You know, a little bit ago, the developers of XFS took care of this 2038 problem, you

01:22.360 --> 01:23.680
know, the future.

01:23.680 --> 01:25.520
They made a patch for the future.

01:25.520 --> 01:27.360
But GRUB has to also support this.

01:27.360 --> 01:32.200
And this recent update of GRUB includes support for the year 2038 problem that XFS developers

01:32.200 --> 01:33.200
solved.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.640
So you can have your future, your bootloader, and your file system.

01:36.640 --> 01:43.160
Jumping up a layer in the stack, our favorite audio and video subsystem got a nice update

01:43.160 --> 01:44.160
this week.

01:44.160 --> 01:52.400
PipeWire 0.3.29 adds support for old Ubuntu and Debian based distros.

01:52.400 --> 01:58.160
So even if you're stuck in the past, your audio and video handling doesn't have to be.

01:58.160 --> 02:04.560
Along with a good size list of bug fixes, some real world features landed.

02:04.560 --> 02:10.560
Number one for a lot of us doing virtual meetings is WebRTC echo canceling was added.

02:10.560 --> 02:14.780
Future versions of PipeWire will do additional integration and justice to this feature.

02:14.780 --> 02:19.360
But this is straight up any way you look at it, a quality of life improvement for every

02:19.360 --> 02:22.960
single desktop Linux user that is using PipeWire.

02:22.960 --> 02:28.480
For Wes and myself, there is some nice improvements like latency reporting that is now implemented

02:28.480 --> 02:31.480
and actually represents all the way up into the Jack application.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.520
So we're going to use the crap out of that.

02:33.520 --> 02:37.020
And there is better handling for multi-channel input profiles.

02:37.020 --> 02:42.520
The PipeWire project also mentioned in this release that they've migrated from Freenode

02:42.520 --> 02:44.520
to OFTC.net.

02:44.520 --> 02:50.320
Overall, just a lot of polish was added this time around, not a ton of new essential core

02:50.320 --> 02:54.160
features but a lot of quality of life improvements.

02:54.160 --> 02:57.160
And you're right, there are some steady gains around things like WebRTC.

02:57.160 --> 03:01.980
If you take a look at the Git repo, you'll see these features have been brewing for quite

03:01.980 --> 03:03.380
some time.

03:03.380 --> 03:07.120
But what always takes the longest is that plumbing and porcelain getting hooked up so

03:07.120 --> 03:10.680
that you and I can actually take advantage of it.

03:10.680 --> 03:15.880
Well going right along with those nice new things, Firefox 89 landed this week.

03:15.880 --> 03:19.280
And really the anticipated thing about this release is Proton UI.

03:19.280 --> 03:23.940
There are some actual under the hood improvements, but the cleanup of the UI has been the big

03:23.940 --> 03:26.560
conversation around the 89 release.

03:26.560 --> 03:30.640
The biggest changes are in how tabs appear in the browser and how websites behave while

03:30.640 --> 03:32.680
they are in the background.

03:32.680 --> 03:40.600
Mozilla says they discovered more than 50% of users have four plus tabs open at all

03:40.600 --> 03:44.480
times and use that to help guide the tabs redesign.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.480
I don't know, only four?

03:46.480 --> 03:49.960
Yeah, I think at least four.

03:49.960 --> 03:58.720
All those tabs now float above the URL bar, each one in its own individual rectangle.

03:58.720 --> 04:03.000
And while the tabs look different, they still behave the same way.

04:03.000 --> 04:07.280
You can click and drag open tabs to rearrange their order or drag them outside of the tab

04:07.280 --> 04:10.000
bar to open a website in a new Firefox window.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.360
And I kind of went to town testing this, playing with it, grouping, you know, control clicking,

04:14.360 --> 04:17.400
shift clicking, all of it was pretty snappy and intuitive.

04:17.400 --> 04:19.040
I also had to play around with it.

04:19.040 --> 04:24.760
And if your distro hasn't updated yet, you can grab Firefox from Flathub, which is published

04:24.760 --> 04:27.880
by the Mozilla developers and is very current.

04:27.880 --> 04:31.760
And it's a nice way to have the most recent version than whatever your distro ships as

04:31.760 --> 04:32.760
well.

04:32.760 --> 04:35.160
And I think they knocked it out of the park.

04:35.160 --> 04:37.480
I really like the new look.

04:37.480 --> 04:38.480
I often do.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.880
I'm kind of a sucker for these new things.

04:40.880 --> 04:46.480
But I realized after I saw it that this is something that was kind of needed and maybe

04:46.480 --> 04:48.240
even sooner than we got it.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.880
But now it's nice to see it here.

04:49.880 --> 04:55.080
Also, I really appreciate the way they've, I guess, modified how notifications are displayed,

04:55.080 --> 04:56.080
you could say.

04:56.080 --> 05:00.560
So instead of getting like a whole bunch of individual onesie twosies now, they've merged

05:00.560 --> 05:04.680
or I guess you could say consolidate all of the pop ups into a single panel.

05:04.680 --> 05:08.640
So instead of getting an individual pop up each time, say Zoom wants access to your mic

05:08.640 --> 05:13.200
and webcam and then the other permissions, they'll all just be there in one box and you

05:13.200 --> 05:15.580
can just say yes, yes or no, no.

05:15.580 --> 05:16.580
That's really nice.

05:16.580 --> 05:17.580
It makes it a lot quicker.

05:17.580 --> 05:21.760
Additionally, iOS and Android users aren't completely left out of the fun.

05:21.760 --> 05:26.200
Some of the elements of the redesign have been brought over to the mobile app versions,

05:26.200 --> 05:29.660
the Android version seeing the most work done there.

05:29.660 --> 05:33.720
And also nice to see web render now enabled on Linux with the Nvidia binary driver on

05:33.720 --> 05:35.360
all desktop environments.

05:35.360 --> 05:42.760
Well, if you felt a buzz in the air this week, maybe the hair stood up on the back of your

05:42.760 --> 05:43.760
neck.

05:43.760 --> 05:50.600
That might have been the good news from the Web Extensions Community Group, who announced

05:50.600 --> 05:57.840
they're forging a common architecture for future web extensions and is inviting developers

05:57.840 --> 05:58.840
to join the effort.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.880
But still not beating heart, Wes.

06:00.880 --> 06:01.880
We tease.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.920
I mean, this actually sounds neat.

06:03.920 --> 06:05.520
Yes, it's another web group.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.000
Yes, it's another.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.040
It's another like organization to decide standards.

06:10.040 --> 06:12.280
But this one seems like it has a real purpose.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.760
It's shortened to WigSigGigGig.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.440
No, that's not how you say it at all.

06:16.440 --> 06:20.800
But it's W-E-C-G and it consists of members from some of the major browser developers

06:20.800 --> 06:21.800
you'd expect.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.600
And that's why I think this actually matters.

06:23.600 --> 06:27.360
You've got employees there from Apple, you got employees from Mozilla, you got employees

06:27.360 --> 06:31.400
from Microsoft and you got contributors from other projects in the open source community,

06:31.400 --> 06:36.440
all coming together to talk about how to build a common web extensions community.

06:36.440 --> 06:40.680
That common architecture they're going to work on may actually result in something.

06:40.680 --> 06:43.500
As for specifics, well, we don't have a ton.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.680
This is pretty new.

06:44.680 --> 06:50.020
But the Web Extensions Community Group say they've got two main overarching goals.

06:50.020 --> 06:56.520
Number one, make extension creation easier for developers by specifying a consistent

06:56.520 --> 07:01.720
model and common core of functionality, APIs and permissions.

07:01.720 --> 07:05.840
Sort of a base playing field for all of this new breed of extension.

07:05.840 --> 07:11.840
Number two, outline an architecture that enhances performance and is even more secure and resistant

07:11.840 --> 07:13.800
to abuse than what we've got today.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.960
Hmm, that's interesting.

07:14.960 --> 07:19.680
I also would not be surprised to see Apple be one of the first to message on this just

07:19.680 --> 07:24.800
because their WWDC event is the Monday that this comes out actually.

07:24.800 --> 07:28.280
And so that is a great platform for them to talk about what they're doing with their Safari

07:28.280 --> 07:29.280
browser.

07:29.280 --> 07:34.960
We will stream that event with limited snarky commentary at jblive.tv during the WWDC keynote

07:34.960 --> 07:36.800
if you'd like to join us.

07:36.800 --> 07:41.920
A big official congratulations to Michael Larrable.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.800
Congratulations!

07:44.800 --> 07:49.520
On June 5th, Ferronix turned 17 years old.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.560
Wow, that's amazing.

07:51.560 --> 07:55.080
And you got to respect that kind of longevity and is customary at this point, Larrable's

07:55.080 --> 07:57.680
offering a discounted membership plan.

07:57.680 --> 08:01.960
He notes it has been kind of a tough year for ads on Ferronix.

08:01.960 --> 08:06.560
And also, you know, based on the audience that he's targeting, ad block usage remains

08:06.560 --> 08:08.120
pretty, pretty high.

08:08.120 --> 08:13.240
Yeah, I'll admit to being one of those offenders sometimes myself.

08:13.240 --> 08:18.400
It sure sounds like it has been a bit of a struggle for Larrable and for Ferronix this

08:18.400 --> 08:19.780
year.

08:19.780 --> 08:23.920
He noted that ad rates continue to struggle throughout the pandemic, which I know has

08:23.920 --> 08:26.400
affected many out there.

08:26.400 --> 08:32.560
He also noted that Ferronix really continues to survive right now only through his own

08:32.560 --> 08:38.720
relentless 100 plus hour work weeks trying to just make ends meet.

08:38.720 --> 08:43.520
That sounds like a dangerous recipe for burnout.

08:43.520 --> 08:47.580
You know, over the years, Larrable has gotten in some shade.

08:47.580 --> 08:51.600
You know, some people who've pushed back on his reporting, maybe he touched on a nerve,

08:51.600 --> 08:56.000
critique something that somebody is really proud of, or, or maybe there was just an accident,

08:56.000 --> 08:57.380
a mistake in his reporting.

08:57.380 --> 08:59.200
Those do happen sometimes.

08:59.200 --> 09:03.760
And I feel like the viral nature of comments and the internet have prevented our community

09:03.760 --> 09:09.520
from really appreciating kind of the remarkable workhorse that Larrable is and honestly what

09:09.520 --> 09:11.480
a resource Ferronix is.

09:11.480 --> 09:17.140
And I think when you're really, really deep into Linux news like Wes and I are, you realize

09:17.140 --> 09:23.120
that legitimately one of the problems our community faces is that there are only a small

09:23.120 --> 09:31.000
handful of original reporting outlets and that pretty much everything else is reporting

09:31.000 --> 09:33.040
on reporting.

09:33.040 --> 09:35.300
And that is not healthy.

09:35.300 --> 09:40.880
That is not a good way to understand and get a full scope of the free software community.

09:40.880 --> 09:46.640
A lot of what gets written about or covered in Linux media at all, be it podcasts or YouTube

09:46.640 --> 09:53.380
or written is truly just created by a small, small number of people.

09:53.380 --> 09:57.580
And Larrable is easily one of the top producers in that small group.

09:57.580 --> 09:59.480
He digs deep into kernel stories.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.700
He does the tedious benchmarks.

10:01.700 --> 10:06.880
He tracks long-term project development and the guy does it seven days a week.

10:06.880 --> 10:11.400
There's times when Wes and I are sitting here in the, in the studio recording LAN on a Sunday

10:11.400 --> 10:13.680
and Larrable's posting stuff to Ferronix.

10:13.680 --> 10:19.940
He's working that seventh day of the week producing content and it's such a resource.

10:19.940 --> 10:24.400
And I think it's because it's been around for 17 years and because a lot of us who are

10:24.400 --> 10:30.100
consuming news content are pretty removed from the process of creating it.

10:30.100 --> 10:35.460
It's not fully appreciated just how vital Ferronix is in the free software information

10:35.460 --> 10:36.460
source.

10:36.460 --> 10:40.340
You know, we like to talk a lot about how great it is sort of reporting and watching

10:40.340 --> 10:45.640
and being a part of the free software ecosystem because so much happens out in the open.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.840
But that only counts if people tell you about it.

10:47.840 --> 10:51.000
Unless you're following all these mailing lists, you don't really know what's going

10:51.000 --> 10:53.920
on or all the exciting updates happening to grub.

10:53.920 --> 10:58.720
In many cases, Michael Larrable is the one following those lists and telling us all about

10:58.720 --> 11:00.400
all the great stuff that's happening.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.400
Yeah.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.340
And you know, 17 years gives them a history as well.

11:04.340 --> 11:08.680
And I think our, I think our community is better off with Ferronix in it.

11:08.680 --> 11:14.720
If you'd like to show your support and hopefully allow for a more viable year ahead, consider

11:14.720 --> 11:22.000
joining Ferronix Premium, making a PayPal tip or just turning off Adblock.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.360
You know, it's not just his own time here.

11:24.360 --> 11:27.280
He's got a great deal of electrical and power expenses.

11:27.280 --> 11:31.980
If you've ever seen the crazy benchmarking setups he's got, and of course he's also

11:31.980 --> 11:44.600
developing and hosting tools like open benchmarking.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.760
Linode is our hosting provider of choice, and that's why we want to recommend them to

11:47.760 --> 11:48.800
you guys.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.080
Everything we've built over the last couple of years, every single time when we've done

11:52.080 --> 11:55.080
an evaluation, Linode has come out on top.

11:55.080 --> 11:58.080
Their infrastructure is solid, fast, and flexible.

11:58.080 --> 12:01.400
You can focus on your project, not on your infrastructure.

12:01.400 --> 12:05.500
You get 11 data centers to choose from and every service level is backed by the best

12:05.500 --> 12:08.240
customer support in the business.

12:08.240 --> 12:11.920
And when it matters, it really matters by phone or ticket, they're going to be there

12:11.920 --> 12:16.540
for you 24 seven Linode's been around since 2003 and at every step of the way, they've

12:16.540 --> 12:21.360
asked themselves, how can we better use Linux to accomplish this next task when they became

12:21.360 --> 12:23.280
their own ISP years ago?

12:23.280 --> 12:25.240
Yeah, they're their own ISP.

12:25.240 --> 12:29.260
They asked themselves, can we use Linux at the networking layer in a way that hasn't

12:29.260 --> 12:30.680
been done before?

12:30.680 --> 12:35.800
And as long timers who use their service can tell, they really truly are Linux geeks.

12:35.800 --> 12:39.960
A few months ago, I set up a $10 a month Linode for Minecraft for my kids.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.680
I wanted to create a safe environment for them.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.880
And Linode has a one click deployment for the Minecraft server where they'll ask you

12:45.880 --> 12:50.060
like all the specifics for me, NPC settings, game mode type, and a bunch of other stuff.

12:50.060 --> 12:53.320
You enter it in, hit submit, they generate the server for you.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.920
And then of course I went and checked it out and it's built in a really intelligent way.

12:56.920 --> 13:01.240
And what's impressive about Linode is it is a great value at whatever level of box you're

13:01.240 --> 13:02.240
getting.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.800
So yeah, you know, I've got, I've got a box that I use for sync thing and I got a box

13:04.800 --> 13:07.980
I use for my kids' Minecraft server and a couple of personal things like that.

13:07.980 --> 13:12.640
But I also use Linode for backend infrastructure for Jupiter broadcasting that has to hold

13:12.640 --> 13:18.080
up to serious traffic or has to do large processing jobs and move surprisingly dumb amounts of

13:18.080 --> 13:19.080
data.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.320
And it just does it like a champ.

13:21.320 --> 13:25.080
And of course they have tons of distributions to choose from and it can be a great platform

13:25.080 --> 13:26.760
to learn as well.

13:26.760 --> 13:31.120
Security, Kubernetes, Terraform, you can mess with all of that on Linode and mess around

13:31.120 --> 13:36.400
with scales that you really could never build at home while using our $100 credit that you

13:36.400 --> 13:39.560
can just get by going to linode.com slash land.

13:39.560 --> 13:43.240
You can learn something, you can deploy something and you can support the show.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.520
There are a lot of ways to host out there.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.420
I mean, there's just a lot of various companies.

13:47.420 --> 13:51.160
Some of them have some crazy business plans, but they're out there and they're going to

13:51.160 --> 13:52.660
offer it to you.

13:52.660 --> 13:57.680
But there is a reason why the JB crew and so many in our community choose Linode every

13:57.680 --> 13:58.760
single time.

13:58.760 --> 14:06.620
So go see for yourself and get that $100 at linode.com slash land linux.ting.com.

14:06.620 --> 14:08.880
Are you sick of overpaying for cell service?

14:08.880 --> 14:09.880
Of course you are.

14:09.880 --> 14:14.920
So go see how much you could save and then take $25 off that at linux.ting.com.

14:14.920 --> 14:15.920
They have great plans.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.120
If you need just a tiny bit of data, you need a ton of data.

14:18.120 --> 14:21.320
You need a limited minutes, very little minutes, you know, all of that stuff.

14:21.320 --> 14:24.200
They've really made it simple and very approachable.

14:24.200 --> 14:28.480
Like for example, they have Ting's set 12 plan that gives you 12 gigs of data, unlimited

14:28.480 --> 14:34.840
talk, unlimited text for $35 a month, guys, $35 a month.

14:34.840 --> 14:39.800
They also have great family plans and flexible plans that allow you to use data as you need

14:39.800 --> 14:41.000
and all of that.

14:41.000 --> 14:46.440
So to start by going to linux.ting.com and just appreciate a simpler, smarter way to

14:46.440 --> 14:47.440
do mobile.

14:47.440 --> 14:49.920
Ting has multiple networks you can pick from as well.

14:49.920 --> 14:52.920
So you're going to find something that has great signal in your area.

14:52.920 --> 14:56.760
And that also means you can bring your device if you want to because Ting's network support

14:56.760 --> 14:57.960
is so broad.

14:57.960 --> 15:00.880
They have a ginormous compatibility.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.000
You also could pick something up new.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.360
In fact, you can get stuff new directly from Ting.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.440
The process sets a bar for mobile.

15:06.440 --> 15:09.560
So you just start at linux.ting.com, you go check your current phone.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.520
They make that ridiculously simple.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.400
I don't know why all the carriers haven't stolen this idea yet.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.400
Once you put the information in for your phone compatibility check, it tells you if it's

15:17.400 --> 15:19.720
going to work or not and they send you a SIM card.

15:19.720 --> 15:22.800
You pop that in and you're pretty much done.

15:22.800 --> 15:25.920
It's like a couple of minutes to set up an account at most and get the phone going.

15:25.920 --> 15:29.120
Fifteen minutes later you got a phone on Ting and you're paying less than you ever thought

15:29.120 --> 15:31.040
was possible for mobile.

15:31.040 --> 15:35.640
And it's that kind of transformative shift where you realize you're never going to go

15:35.640 --> 15:38.160
back to the old way of doing mobile.

15:38.160 --> 15:44.600
So go to linux.ting.com, take $25 off a device or get $25 in service credit and support the

15:44.600 --> 15:45.600
show.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.520
There's never been a better time to try Ting Mobile.

15:47.520 --> 15:51.600
They've upgraded their plans to the next level and I've been a Ting customer for a long time.

15:51.600 --> 15:55.400
I can attest that Ting has really, really got some competitive plans now.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.640
So go try them out.

15:56.640 --> 15:57.640
Linux.ting.com.

15:57.640 --> 16:06.760
OpenSUSE Leap 15.3 is now officially available.

16:06.760 --> 16:11.400
And maybe you're wondering why we're mentioning this latest minor release, but it's noteworthy

16:11.400 --> 16:13.480
for more than a few reasons.

16:13.480 --> 16:19.240
The first of those is that it's the first Leap release that's using the exact same binary

16:19.240 --> 16:23.380
packages as SUSE Linux Enterprise.

16:23.380 --> 16:31.920
Leap 15.3 is based on SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP3 and should see at least 18 months of

16:31.920 --> 16:33.180
updates.

16:33.180 --> 16:34.360
That's attractive right there.

16:34.360 --> 16:41.240
But what really caught our attention is OpenSUSE Leap 15.3 is pulling in DNF 4.7.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.960
Look at that, DNF, Fedora's Package Manager.

16:43.960 --> 16:48.600
Now I think DNF has been available for a while, but there's some additional work that's been

16:48.600 --> 16:50.640
done in Leap 15.3, right?

16:50.640 --> 16:56.680
Yeah, you could get it pretty easily in 15.2, but it wasn't so easy to actually use it to

16:56.680 --> 17:00.540
go get any packages, at least without configuring it all yourself.

17:00.540 --> 17:04.840
But now there's a couple of packages you can install, one which enables DNF to use the

17:04.840 --> 17:09.880
repositories that you've configured for use with Yast and Zipper, or another one that

17:09.880 --> 17:14.120
lets you just set up stable repository configurations independent of Zipper and Yast.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.880
So you've got some flexible options.

17:16.880 --> 17:22.560
The other really impressive piece to this DNF support is it's not just installing packages.

17:22.560 --> 17:29.040
It's now possible to upgrade from Leap to Tumbleweed powered by DNF.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.720
That's ridiculously great.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.640
I got to try this at some point.

17:32.640 --> 17:35.200
This puts it back on the tri-radar.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.480
I want to play around with DNF on SUSE.

17:37.480 --> 17:40.640
And I like that Leap's going to have 18 months of support, that it's been built from the

17:40.640 --> 17:41.640
enterprise binaries.

17:41.640 --> 17:44.680
That's a lot of really nice competitive offerings.

17:44.680 --> 17:50.480
And again, like we say this all the time, but in reflection on the CentOS changes, it's

17:50.480 --> 17:53.400
nice to see value added to distributions like Leap here like this.

17:53.400 --> 17:58.960
It gives OpenSUSE and SUSE Enterprise Linux a compatibility that I think gives developers

17:58.960 --> 17:59.960
some comfort.

17:59.960 --> 18:05.240
Well, something making Robert McQueen, President of the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors,

18:05.240 --> 18:10.440
a little uncomfortable is the GNOME Project's finances.

18:10.440 --> 18:16.000
Writing this week in a blog post, he said that the GNOME Project needs to broaden its

18:16.000 --> 18:22.700
focus in order to attract more new users and ultimately to be able to raise funds from

18:22.700 --> 18:27.080
new organizations outside of their traditional reach.

18:27.080 --> 18:33.000
If they aren't able to find some new funding sources, they may need to scale back in some

18:33.000 --> 18:36.080
of their efforts.

18:36.080 --> 18:41.960
The latest budget approved by the Board of Directors has the foundation spending more

18:41.960 --> 18:43.920
money than they're currently taking in.

18:43.920 --> 18:49.240
Now, of course, that's never a good policy, but the GNOME Foundation actually has a reserves

18:49.240 --> 18:54.720
policy that dictates they're not allowed to do this based on, well, experiences from the

18:54.720 --> 18:55.720
past.

18:55.720 --> 18:56.720
Easier said than done.

18:56.720 --> 19:01.160
Yeah, I mean, right now, it seems that their financial situation's good.

19:01.160 --> 19:04.540
They haven't run into problems yet, but they can see it on the horizon.

19:04.540 --> 19:07.740
So they want to find new sources of funding.

19:07.740 --> 19:13.280
And it seems like they have to move beyond their current reach to get those new funds.

19:13.280 --> 19:18.980
In fact, McQueen commented, to raise funds from new sources, the foundation needs to

19:18.980 --> 19:26.200
take the message and ideals of GNOME and open source software to new, wider audiences that

19:26.200 --> 19:27.200
we can help.

19:27.200 --> 19:33.560
We've been developing themes such as affordability, privacy, trust, and education as promising

19:33.560 --> 19:37.340
areas for new programs that broaden our impact.

19:37.340 --> 19:42.600
The goal is to find projects and funding that allow us to both invest in the GNOME community

19:42.600 --> 19:49.200
and find new ways for FOSS to benefit people who aren't already in our community.

19:49.200 --> 19:53.920
Now, when a project starts talking about raising funds and starts talking about including people

19:53.920 --> 19:58.400
who aren't in our community yet, you worry that perhaps that money is going to go towards

19:58.400 --> 20:02.180
trying to reach out to people who just simply don't have any interest in development.

20:02.180 --> 20:04.480
But I think they've learned lessons from the past.

20:04.480 --> 20:08.160
I think they are there being proactive here.

20:08.160 --> 20:11.960
And McQueen had a message for current and future board members.

20:11.960 --> 20:17.400
I'd like to make clear that I see this, reaching the outside world and finding funding to support

20:17.400 --> 20:23.520
that, as the main priority and responsibility of the board for the next term.

20:23.520 --> 20:29.760
We need to understand our financial situation and the trade-offs we have to make and help

20:29.760 --> 20:34.320
to define the strategy with the executive director so that we can launch some new programs

20:34.320 --> 20:38.760
that will broaden our impact and funding for the future.

20:38.760 --> 20:46.560
Well, you can imagine my surprise after all this time when I saw in my feeds that the

20:46.560 --> 20:50.760
Atari VCS actually has a ship date.

20:50.760 --> 20:55.760
June 15th, 2021, the Atari VCS will be released into stores.

20:55.760 --> 21:01.760
Now, I don't understand because I was in the crowdfunding campaign and I thought I was

21:01.760 --> 21:03.880
supposed to receive my console by now.

21:03.880 --> 21:04.880
And I have not.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.320
I have not received my console.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.640
I don't know what happened.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.240
I don't know how I got left out of this.

21:10.240 --> 21:15.400
But if you guys aren't familiar, like 200 years ago, a company that calls itself Atari

21:15.400 --> 21:21.880
announced a console PC hybrid that runs Linux and has an interface to play games on your

21:21.880 --> 21:27.280
TV and also allows you to run whatever operating system you want in there.

21:27.280 --> 21:32.440
There's also Google Chrome built in, along with the mobile companion app for controlling

21:32.440 --> 21:36.880
Chrome and other apps with the virtual mouse and keyboard.

21:36.880 --> 21:42.680
Sounds like it's also enabled for access to other streaming services like Google's Stadia.

21:42.680 --> 21:45.640
I guess that's kind of not bad, right?

21:45.640 --> 21:49.040
If you had a Stadia account and you wanted to hook up a console to your machine that

21:49.040 --> 21:52.560
wasn't Android, I suppose, I mean, I'm stretching here.

21:52.560 --> 21:53.560
I'm stretching.

21:53.560 --> 21:56.880
When you try to go to their website right now, they're sold out of everything but hats.

21:56.880 --> 22:01.360
So you can't actually order a console, a controller or a joystick.

22:01.360 --> 22:05.520
Maybe that's because they're still busy fulfilling the campaign backers like me.

22:05.520 --> 22:07.940
But it's sold out right now.

22:07.940 --> 22:13.720
But I think the idea is, at least the claim is, for about $300 on June 15th, you could

22:13.720 --> 22:16.000
go into a Best Buy and you could buy one.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
So are you going to do it, Wes?

22:17.000 --> 22:20.560
Are you going to pick yourself up an Atari VCS for that nice retro wood look?

22:20.560 --> 22:25.760
No, I think I'll wait for you to see if you end up with your shipment.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.040
But in the meantime, I'll take a green hat, please.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.040
Fair enough.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.040
Yeah, grab yourself a hat.

22:31.040 --> 22:32.040
I'm waiting to see.

22:32.040 --> 22:39.960
I hope I do get mine because I will feel like it was nearly $400 well spent if it can do

22:39.960 --> 22:44.520
some streaming services, it can maybe run Kodi and it can play some of my steam games

22:44.520 --> 22:45.520
and some of my other games that I like.

22:45.520 --> 22:50.720
And there have actually been games ported to Linux as a result of work to get them running

22:50.720 --> 22:54.320
on the Atari VCS because essentially it's just straight up Linux.

22:54.320 --> 22:57.560
And so to get your game working on there, you just make it a Linux game.

22:57.560 --> 23:01.760
And those games are already available on Steam right now for purchase.

23:01.760 --> 23:02.760
And that's kind of nice.

23:02.760 --> 23:06.600
I mean, even if this really doesn't sell that much, it meant that we got a few more Linux

23:06.600 --> 23:08.720
native games, I suppose.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.800
There's less of a downside to it not happening.

23:10.800 --> 23:17.160
Yeah, but I guess at this point it means you're basically just paying for the console interface.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.920
Well, and of course, that sweet wood paneling look.

23:19.920 --> 23:23.920

23:40.240 --> 23:44.160
Two very different angles, one very interesting keyboard.

23:44.160 --> 23:49.240
As for us, though, we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux in

23:49.240 --> 23:51.160
