Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.660 --> 00:20.460
This is episode 10 recorded on the 16th of July 2017.

00:20.460 --> 00:21.460
I'm Joe.

00:21.460 --> 00:22.680
And I'm Ryan.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.760
And Chris isn't here, he's on holiday.

00:24.760 --> 00:29.080
So we've asked Ryan to step in and thank you very much for doing that, Ryan.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.080
No problem.

00:30.080 --> 00:33.600
I'm housed here at the System76 headquarters.

00:33.600 --> 00:39.000
And I've got everything set up my whole command center, three monitors, a mic, you know, it's

00:39.000 --> 00:40.660
just I'm ready to go.

00:40.660 --> 00:41.660
I'm ready and I'm willing.

00:41.660 --> 00:42.660
Nice.

00:42.660 --> 00:46.400
I was going to mention System76, but you just literally couldn't wait, could you?

00:46.400 --> 00:48.400
No, no, of course.

00:48.400 --> 00:53.220
Okay, well, let's start with Fedora 26, which has been released.

00:53.220 --> 01:01.880
And there's kind of a few not that exciting things like GCC 7, Golang 1.8, Python 3.6,

01:01.880 --> 01:05.020
and loads of under the hood stuff.

01:05.020 --> 01:13.320
But there's also a new GUI for partition editing in the installer called Blivit GUI, which

01:13.320 --> 01:14.320
isn't that new.

01:14.320 --> 01:16.080
It's been in the repo since Fedora 21.

01:16.080 --> 01:19.420
But now it's kind of in the default live image.

01:19.420 --> 01:21.760
So have you given Fedora 26 a go?

01:21.760 --> 01:24.040
I haven't given Fedora 26.

01:24.040 --> 01:29.680
I was using Fedora 25 for a while, just playing around seeing what was available there.

01:29.680 --> 01:33.120
But I have not yet tried this out, although I probably will.

01:33.120 --> 01:38.820
We played with it here a few times, especially since kind of, this will be later, but since

01:38.820 --> 01:44.640
we started working on Popover at System76, we've been looking across the entire Linux

01:44.640 --> 01:50.440
distribution landscape to see where people are doing things well and trying to emulate

01:50.440 --> 01:51.440
that.

01:51.440 --> 01:53.560
I'm really curious to see the partition manager.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.480
I can't find any pictures of that.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.360
And I tried looking earlier, too.

01:58.360 --> 02:04.220
I'm not sure if I'm just missing the link in this release or what, but have you played

02:04.220 --> 02:05.220
with it yet?

02:05.220 --> 02:08.740
Yeah, well, I always would do the advanced partitioning because it's usually on a test

02:08.740 --> 02:12.160
machine that's got several partitions.

02:12.160 --> 02:13.800
And it looks pretty good.

02:13.800 --> 02:19.920
But in terms of functionality, it was a bit lacking because I've got a logical partition

02:19.920 --> 02:27.040
and it wouldn't, well, at least I couldn't see a way to enlarge that to add another partition

02:27.040 --> 02:28.040
for Fedora.

02:28.040 --> 02:32.520
So I had to put in one more primary and then that was the maximum number of partitions

02:32.520 --> 02:34.600
for the disk.

02:34.600 --> 02:38.080
So that means I'll have to delete Fedora if I want to install anything else.

02:38.080 --> 02:45.920
So that wasn't great, but it looks good at least, but I'm used to using GParted basically.

02:45.920 --> 02:52.000
It's that I would always do that, or even the partition editing in Ubiquity as well.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
Yeah.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Yeah.

02:54.000 --> 02:58.200
I was kind of just looking through the release notes here.

02:58.200 --> 03:04.240
I think I remember last week, was it, Matt was talking on Linux Unplugged?

03:04.240 --> 03:07.440
Yeah, he spoke quite a lot about it.

03:07.440 --> 03:12.240
And to me, there's nothing hugely exciting about it, but in a way that's good to me.

03:12.240 --> 03:15.080
I don't think huge changes are good, really.

03:15.080 --> 03:20.720
I think that it sounds like steady improvements and just progression with new packages, new

03:20.720 --> 03:25.760
kernel, that kind of thing, and a few features here and there, but nothing massively exciting.

03:25.760 --> 03:26.760
Right.

03:26.760 --> 03:34.320
The thing I'd be most interested in seeing is if there are any changes to Wayland and

03:34.320 --> 03:39.000
how it interacts with applications.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.160
I know that I've talked to Alberto Ruiz and some of the guys over at Red Hat about the

03:45.160 --> 03:50.000
work that they've been putting into that effort, and I don't know if any of that was scheduled

03:50.000 --> 03:53.960
to be in this release, but I just know that they've been putting a lot of time and effort

03:53.960 --> 03:57.840
into Wayland and how that interacts with applications.

03:57.840 --> 04:03.600
Right now you can't really do screen sharing in a Wayland session, and other things like

04:03.600 --> 04:08.360
that, just little things that I'm wondering what the progress of that on.

04:08.360 --> 04:13.560
I bet Fedora is a great way to keep up with that Wayland development and see what the

04:13.560 --> 04:16.880
new and shiny is.

04:16.880 --> 04:21.360
I definitely will have to pull it down and at least play around with the Wayland session

04:21.360 --> 04:31.160
and see if anything has changed, because right now I use Wayland every day on my POP system

04:31.160 --> 04:35.380
and for the most part it's pretty stable and it's a good experience, but there are little

04:35.380 --> 04:44.120
tiny things that I'm hoping that are getting addressed and I want to see how they're implementing

04:44.120 --> 04:47.440
it in Fedora and if that's any different.

04:47.440 --> 04:52.040
Yeah, well Fedora really blazed the trail when it comes to Wayland, so I think you should

04:52.040 --> 04:53.840
definitely check it out.

04:53.840 --> 04:58.520
But another story that developed shortly after this was that there is a proposal by Justin

04:58.520 --> 05:06.320
Forbes who's one of the Fedora kernel maintainers to drop the 32-bit kernel because essentially

05:06.320 --> 05:11.960
hardly anyone is using it, hardly anyone is testing it, and it's just time for it to go

05:11.960 --> 05:12.960
basically.

05:12.960 --> 05:19.560
I have been skeptical, shall we say, about dropping 32-bit support in Linux, but I think

05:19.560 --> 05:23.080
the time is coming and we've seen it with Arch, we've seen it with Tails, we've seen

05:23.080 --> 05:25.680
it with various other distros.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.160
Do we really need 32-bit support anymore?

05:28.160 --> 05:38.120
Frankly, I have not used a 32-bit system for probably a couple years now, maybe longer.

05:38.120 --> 05:44.360
Even in systems that are rocking 30 gigs of RAM, which I know isn't the only difference,

05:44.360 --> 05:48.800
but I still have been throwing 64-bit on them.

05:48.800 --> 05:56.520
So I don't know between myself and my family and my friends of anybody who's using a 32-bit

05:56.520 --> 06:02.000
system, although now that I said that, probably my friends who are listening to this will

06:02.000 --> 06:04.720
probably ping me and let me know that they are.

06:04.720 --> 06:11.760
But if it's just a lot of extra work for them and they don't have people who are doing this

06:11.760 --> 06:18.360
regularly enough people who can test out and make sure everything's working properly, then

06:18.360 --> 06:25.440
it's better to drop it than to offer something that hasn't been thoroughly tested.

06:25.440 --> 06:31.560
And maybe that's not the case, but based on kind of what's in this article, it seems like

06:31.560 --> 06:37.720
there might be some problems with QA and maybe not enough of that happening.

06:37.720 --> 06:41.840
And so I think that it might just be time.

06:41.840 --> 06:46.280
And if somebody is really, really passionate about it, maybe they can pick that up and

06:46.280 --> 06:47.280
take on that project.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.280
Yeah.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.660
I mean, the thing is on the desktop, it doesn't really make any sense anymore.

06:50.660 --> 06:55.320
The only thing I would say is the 32-bit Atom machines, but even they're pretty long in

06:55.320 --> 07:01.520
the tooth at this point, but I would say that with Atomic, Fedora Atomic, that might possibly

07:01.520 --> 07:07.040
make sense to have a 32-bit version because if you've got a lot of VMs running and you

07:07.040 --> 07:12.080
want them to be as small and lean as possible, then it might, there are some circumstances

07:12.080 --> 07:17.680
where it would make sense to be 32-bit, but yeah, I think really that that's a pretty

07:17.680 --> 07:18.680
edge case.

07:18.680 --> 07:23.280
So yeah, I think it is time to move on from 32-bit now.

07:23.280 --> 07:28.880
But let's move on and talk about Unity, or is it Unit, Y-U-N-I-T.

07:28.880 --> 07:34.520
It's the worst name I've heard since pop underscore OS.

07:34.520 --> 07:40.920
And so that is the fork or the continuation, I suppose you'd say, of Unity 8, which Canonical

07:40.920 --> 07:44.840
famously dropped earlier this year.

07:44.840 --> 07:53.920
And it is now available as an overlay repository for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, which I think is good

07:53.920 --> 07:59.320
news for them because you need to start somewhere and the LTS seems like a very logical place

07:59.320 --> 08:01.900
to start for me.

08:01.900 --> 08:05.960
And I've tested it out and it didn't work very well at all, but you, as I say, you have

08:05.960 --> 08:06.960
to start somewhere.

08:06.960 --> 08:14.120
I don't have a great deal of faith in Unit or Unity as, well, as having a future put

08:14.120 --> 08:20.160
it that way because without the great resources that Shotoworth brought to Canonical as a

08:20.160 --> 08:25.240
community project, I just have to wonder who is really interested in Unity 8.

08:25.240 --> 08:29.360
Yeah, I am patiently watching.

08:29.360 --> 08:33.840
I'm in the Telegram channel as well.

08:33.840 --> 08:39.120
I don't really have any feelings on it only because right now I'm not sure where this

08:39.120 --> 08:41.120
project will end up.

08:41.120 --> 08:47.320
Like when I think about people deciding on a distribution and on a desktop environment,

08:47.320 --> 08:52.560
I don't know anyone beyond the people who are in that channel, you know, who are actively

08:52.560 --> 09:00.500
contributing to it, who have told me just in, you know, little Linux user groups around

09:00.500 --> 09:06.840
and some of my friends who I talked to online, none of them have said, yeah, I really want

09:06.840 --> 09:08.960
to give Unit a try.

09:08.960 --> 09:13.400
Maybe that'll change now that these packages are available for the LTS, maybe, you know,

09:13.400 --> 09:18.980
someone who's running that will pull it down and I might throw it on one of the test machines

09:18.980 --> 09:24.240
here at the office just to look at it, but I'm just going to reserve judgment until I

09:24.240 --> 09:29.820
see where the project goes and what their big overarching goals are.

09:29.820 --> 09:36.680
The main thing is the applications that are built for Unity 8, I'll call it Unity 8 because

09:36.680 --> 09:38.840
Unit is weird to me.

09:38.840 --> 09:44.880
I'm worried that there won't be that many native applications beyond the core ones that

09:44.880 --> 09:51.720
already exist and maybe I'm wrong, I could probably spend some time like looking through

09:51.720 --> 09:57.640
their documentation and see if anybody's creating new applications for it, but I think as far

09:57.640 --> 10:04.220
as interest goes, I think maybe at least among the developers I know who are developing applications

10:04.220 --> 10:12.600
for it, a lot of their interest for developing native applications died along with Canonical's

10:12.600 --> 10:20.080
backing of the project, but you know, they seem to be chugging along so I could prove

10:20.080 --> 10:26.000
wrong in this and in a few months we might be talking more and more about the project,

10:26.000 --> 10:31.820
but I think my honest opinion is I think we're looking at a known world for the foreseeable

10:31.820 --> 10:32.820
future.

10:32.820 --> 10:36.920
You would, wouldn't you, but yeah, I think that this and UbiPorts, now their community

10:36.920 --> 10:42.640
efforts, I really want them to succeed, I want convergence to happen, I always wanted

10:42.640 --> 10:47.920
it to happen when Canonical were paying to develop it, now it's out in the community,

10:47.920 --> 10:52.720
I think it's probably going to take a lot longer, but it would be great to have a phone

10:52.720 --> 10:58.260
that is a serious competitor to Android and have convergence working and have one device

10:58.260 --> 11:05.840
that can have all my Linux desktop and phone needs taken care of, but yeah, I think we'll

11:05.840 --> 11:08.480
be waiting a while for that, so here's hoping.

11:08.480 --> 11:15.800
Yeah, if I was going to bet the farm on an alternative to Android, I'd be much, right

11:15.800 --> 11:22.880
now at this very moment, I'd be much more comfortable saying that Sailfish would be

11:22.880 --> 11:29.840
that before I would say Unit, but I know some of the guys working on it and they are driven

11:29.840 --> 11:35.680
and, you know, they have a lot of passion for the project, so that's why I have to reserve

11:35.680 --> 11:37.960
judgment because they could prove me wrong.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.840
Yeah, here's hoping.

11:39.840 --> 11:43.200
Well let's move on and talk about Ubuntu being in the Windows Store.

11:43.200 --> 11:46.540
We've been talking on various Linux shows about the Windows subsystem for Linux for

11:46.540 --> 11:54.640
a while now, and now Ubuntu is a Windows app, what kind of topsy-turvy bizarro world are

11:54.640 --> 11:59.280
we living in when I can say that, that, you know, okay, you have to be enrolled in the

11:59.280 --> 12:04.880
Windows Insiders program and you have to be on the latest build of Windows, but Ubuntu

12:04.880 --> 12:06.480
is in the Windows App Store.

12:06.480 --> 12:07.960
What is going on?

12:07.960 --> 12:13.400
Honestly, I've been thinking about how I feel about this for ever since it was released

12:13.400 --> 12:15.800
and I still don't know how I feel about it.

12:15.800 --> 12:22.680
I can't determine whether this is a good thing or a bad thing or it doesn't matter.

12:22.680 --> 12:27.400
I'm really curious to hear your thoughts because, I mean, I know this story is specific to it

12:27.400 --> 12:33.280
being in the App Store, which is interesting in and of itself, but I had a very hard time

12:33.280 --> 12:39.160
formulating an opinion on this specific feature in Windows.

12:39.160 --> 12:43.000
Well I feel ambivalent, I think, I think most of us do because on the one hand there's a

12:43.000 --> 12:49.840
chance that it's going to expose Windows users to Ubuntu and therefore Linux and therefore

12:49.840 --> 12:54.600
free software and open source and all the rest of that and they might be using this

12:54.600 --> 12:59.760
instead of Cygwin and therefore they might realize, hey, this Ubuntu thing is actually

12:59.760 --> 13:04.080
pretty good, but it's not desktop.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.360
They've never said it was going to be desktop.

13:05.360 --> 13:09.080
I saw some people complaining in the reviews that X11 doesn't work.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.000
Well it was never supposed to work.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.800
You can hack it and make it work just about, so I read, but yeah, I kind of feel ambivalent

13:16.800 --> 13:21.960
because I'd like that to be true, but I think the reality is it's more a case of people

13:21.960 --> 13:26.440
who are dual booting because they have their games or some other stuff they need and they

13:26.440 --> 13:32.280
don't really use the Ubuntu partition that often now basically don't have any need to

13:32.280 --> 13:36.200
use the Ubuntu partition and so they can just go Windows full time and I think that's what

13:36.200 --> 13:38.440
Microsoft's game is here.

13:38.440 --> 13:39.520
I think you're right.

13:39.520 --> 13:45.800
I think that, well, I remember talking to one of the guys on this project at OSCON I

13:45.800 --> 13:53.600
think last year and I remember he was an Ubuntu user.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.320
I found that pretty interesting.

13:55.320 --> 14:00.440
He was working inside Microsoft, but he was using Ubuntu full time and this is obviously

14:00.440 --> 14:10.120
just an anecdotal story of me talking to a guy, but he just found it really interesting

14:10.120 --> 14:16.040
work and thought it was good all around for Linux because it exposes more people to Linux,

14:16.040 --> 14:21.860
but listening to you raise the point that, yeah, there are going to be people who use

14:21.860 --> 14:28.000
Linux and they feel like they need to be able to use that bash environment on Windows that

14:28.000 --> 14:33.760
are going to simply stop dual booting because, you know, or although in those cases they

14:33.760 --> 14:38.360
might have a virtual machine, but the point is that there's a chance that they might stop

14:38.360 --> 14:40.600
dual booting because, hey, I've got it right here.

14:40.600 --> 14:41.600
I've got everything I need.

14:41.600 --> 14:47.560
I've got apt, I've got git, I've got SSH, it's all right here and that's all I needed.

14:47.560 --> 14:56.780
The other side of it that's exciting though is that Linux is popular enough among developers

14:56.780 --> 15:02.760
that this is something that Windows and Microsoft felt like they needed.

15:02.760 --> 15:05.000
I don't know how exactly that worked.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.400
I think there was a blog post on it though from Justin Kirkland where it talked about

15:09.400 --> 15:17.280
how they started talking about this, them being Microsoft and Canonical and ultimately

15:17.280 --> 15:18.860
worked together on this.

15:18.860 --> 15:22.520
If that came from Microsoft, that's really interesting.

15:22.520 --> 15:28.920
That shows that they felt a distinct need to have a Linux user space in Windows for

15:28.920 --> 15:34.960
certain types of customers and I think that would speak to what thinking is like inside

15:34.960 --> 15:40.180
of Microsoft as far as courting those developer customers.

15:40.180 --> 15:46.460
And so that is the more interesting side of the story I think, but I'm curious to see

15:46.460 --> 15:53.880
if we have any people telling stories on their blog about using Ubuntu from the Windows store

15:53.880 --> 15:58.080
and then becoming a full-time Ubuntu user, or if we see anything that's the opposite

15:58.080 --> 16:00.360
of that.

16:00.360 --> 16:07.560
I'm just really interested in seeing how this plays out.

16:07.560 --> 16:08.560
DigitalOcean.com.

16:08.560 --> 16:13.000
Sign up with the promo code, here's the thing, to get $10 credit.

16:13.000 --> 16:17.120
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

16:17.120 --> 16:22.520
easy way to spin up a cloud server and you can do so in 55 seconds and with prices starting

16:22.520 --> 16:27.080
at only $5 per month, that means you can get two months free if you use the promo code,

16:27.080 --> 16:28.080
here's the thing.

16:28.080 --> 16:32.640
They've got data centers all over the world and they've got a great simple interface for

16:32.640 --> 16:36.760
dealing with your droplets as they call them and they've got a great API as well if you

16:36.760 --> 16:37.760
want to script it.

16:37.760 --> 16:42.960
Loads of the JB infrastructure runs on DigitalOcean and I've been using it for years personally

16:42.960 --> 16:46.120
and recently they've introduced high CPU droplets.

16:46.120 --> 16:50.480
The thing is their standard CPUs are pretty powerful but now if you need that extra bit

16:50.480 --> 16:55.360
of performance for your application then they've got Skylake and Broadwell Xeons for the absolute

16:55.360 --> 16:56.920
maximum performance.

16:56.920 --> 17:00.520
So whether you want just a small next cloud server or a hugely powerful Linux rig out

17:00.520 --> 17:04.720
in the cloud, go to DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code, here's the thing, and get

17:04.720 --> 17:09.940
$10 in credit to get you started.

17:09.940 --> 17:17.560
As of July 13th, Aiki is working full time on Solus and that was his first day and he

17:17.560 --> 17:24.800
posted to his Patreons thanking them for their support and frankly this is awesome.

17:24.800 --> 17:35.120
Another person working on Linux full time is great and Aiki is such a smart dude that

17:35.120 --> 17:41.880
I've been watching his stuff as well trying to see what's coming out of it that frankly

17:41.880 --> 17:49.920
System76 can use and so I'm very proud that the community was able to come together and

17:49.920 --> 17:50.920
do this for him.

17:50.920 --> 17:55.520
Yeah we did talk about this I think four episodes ago on Linux Action News but Aiki's my friend

17:55.520 --> 17:59.800
so I thought well Chris is the way I'll slip this one in again and as you say this is just

17:59.800 --> 18:05.800
great news, he'd been pretty happy at Intel, well very happy actually and he'd learned

18:05.800 --> 18:13.480
a lot but the time had come and now he's full time with it and Solus is a great distro and

18:13.480 --> 18:20.200
the development has already just massively accelerated and so I think that this, he was

18:20.200 --> 18:24.880
doing this as a part time job and now it's his full time job, it's going to mean great

18:24.880 --> 18:29.000
things for Solus and as you say probably for the rest of the Linux community as well because

18:29.000 --> 18:33.800
you've got Budgie and also there's a lot of the technicalities of the under the hood stuff

18:33.800 --> 18:39.560
with Solus which I think a lot of the other distros could benefit from if they integrated

18:39.560 --> 18:43.200
that stuff like the bulletproof boot and stuff like that.

18:43.200 --> 18:47.440
So if you do want to help him out check out patreon.com slash solus and throw him a few

18:47.440 --> 18:48.440
bucks a month.

18:48.440 --> 18:56.360
Yeah and I wanted to add to that, I've heard some people say like oh you know another project

18:56.360 --> 19:03.000
we don't need this blah blah blah but none of this happens in a bubble you know I just

19:03.000 --> 19:08.160
from personal experience working in a Linux company, a Linux focused company, when these

19:08.160 --> 19:14.400
projects are around we never knock them here because we're always looking at okay how is

19:14.400 --> 19:18.680
this project doing this you know and if there's something great happening there then the rest

19:18.680 --> 19:25.040
of the community can adopt that and you know contribute to that and it just makes Linux

19:25.040 --> 19:29.640
as a whole better so if you're interested in seeing what they're what what Ike's up

19:29.640 --> 19:33.560
to and what the project is up to you know check out its github and throw them a few

19:33.560 --> 19:38.280
bucks if you can because it'll ultimately benefit everyone and I say that about Solus

19:38.280 --> 19:44.320
I say that about elementary I say that about Abuja Mate you know we're we're all a rising

19:44.320 --> 19:50.880
tide right raises all ships so yeah supporting these guys really does make the Linux desktop

19:50.880 --> 19:51.880
as a whole better.

19:51.880 --> 19:58.200
Yeah okay well let's talk about a Linux desktop with which you are intimately familiar there's

19:58.200 --> 20:03.640
been an update this week from System76 who are they on pop exclamation mark underscore

20:03.640 --> 20:09.160
OS now from the blog post it says of the GNOME work that you guys have been doing CalDAV

20:09.160 --> 20:14.860
and CardDAV work continues but the deeper we've dug the more hard coding we've found

20:14.860 --> 20:20.460
now that is something that concerns me concerns me and I've heard that concern from a lot

20:20.460 --> 20:26.360
of people you guys have taken on a big big challenge here to create your own distro even

20:26.360 --> 20:30.240
though it's based on Ubuntu and basically Ubuntu GNOME and it's not that different at

20:30.240 --> 20:36.560
the moment but you have taken on a lot and it seems that you are slowly realizing that

20:36.560 --> 20:37.640
fact.

20:37.640 --> 20:41.880
I think we realized it from the get-go we talked to a lot of projects before we jumped

20:41.880 --> 20:46.000
in for instance we're really close to the elementary guys and so we had conversations

20:46.000 --> 20:49.320
about what we wanted to do especially with GNOME online accounts which is what we're

20:49.320 --> 20:54.880
talking about here and so we already had set aside some resources for this specifically

20:54.880 --> 21:01.520
with GNOME contacts and GNOME calendar and Geary and those applications that should be

21:01.520 --> 21:07.560
using the evolution data server and sharing you know this information in many cases they've

21:07.560 --> 21:14.560
implemented how they talk to GNOME online accounts slightly different and so I don't

21:14.560 --> 21:21.360
think that it's really unexpected that we have to do a bit of work I guess it is kind

21:21.360 --> 21:29.400
of surprising that there wasn't a single implementation for this type of stuff across these applications

21:29.400 --> 21:34.880
but we have one of our engineers David working on this pretty essentially full-time right

21:34.880 --> 21:39.120
now and so he's going through and doing a lot of plumbing on this we've also teamed

21:39.120 --> 21:44.400
up with elementary they've been making a big push with Pantheon Mail to implement the evolution

21:44.400 --> 21:50.920
data server in Pantheon Mail and so we're looking to see how they're doing that and

21:50.920 --> 21:55.960
talking to them about where we can work together to kind of do some of this plumbing and in

21:55.960 --> 22:02.360
shared applications okay and also this installer situation it seems that you guys are not a

22:02.360 --> 22:08.320
fan of Ubiquity which is by far my favorite installer and you don't like one specific

22:08.320 --> 22:13.640
bit of it which is the bit that I really like and that is that it's very linear you stick

22:13.640 --> 22:19.520
all your information into it it finishes reboot done login start using it whereas the GNOME

22:19.520 --> 22:24.640
way to do things by default is to do a little bit upfront and then once you boot it for

22:24.640 --> 22:30.640
the first time then you put in things like your locale and username and passwords and

22:30.640 --> 22:35.980
all that kind of stuff I don't know why you don't just use the OEM installer quite frankly

22:35.980 --> 22:42.680
because that is it you know that does it for you yeah we do use the OEM installer the OEM

22:42.680 --> 22:48.720
installer still prompts you to do some things in Ubiquity that we decided should be in GNOME

22:48.720 --> 22:53.760
initial setup for instance I remember when we started this conversation it actually started

22:53.760 --> 22:59.040
because of the Ubuntu mailing list and they were saying there are things in Ubiquity that

22:59.040 --> 23:04.600
you do that you then end up doing in GNOME initial setup and that's really quite weird

23:04.600 --> 23:11.360
and so because even the first time I did it I was like why am I filling out this information

23:11.360 --> 23:16.280
twice so we were having conversations and at first we were actually on the opposite

23:16.280 --> 23:24.600
side we were talking to the to Jeremy Beecher and we're saying why isn't this all in Ubiquity

23:24.600 --> 23:31.000
and then over time as we played around with GNOME initial setup more we decided oh wait

23:31.000 --> 23:36.120
okay so let's say that you create a new user you could run them through some of this GNOME

23:36.120 --> 23:41.600
initial setup stuff so that they can set up things specifically on their account like

23:41.600 --> 23:46.800
for instance if they do want a different keyboard layout or something they as a user can set

23:46.800 --> 23:53.880
that up specifically and then as we went further down that path we realized well Ubiquity could

23:53.880 --> 24:00.040
be paired back to where it's only handles things that are specific to an installation

24:00.040 --> 24:05.860
of a machine and then on first boot a person can set up the rest of their stuff through

24:05.860 --> 24:10.080
initial setup and it just seemed as we played around with it more it seemed like a better

24:10.080 --> 24:16.040
user experience and so because you might have like in the case of me installing something

24:16.040 --> 24:20.680
for someone else I might install do some complicated partitioning or whatever and then hand that

24:20.680 --> 24:26.120
off to a friend or a family member and then when they go through a new GNOME initial setup

24:26.120 --> 24:31.160
they're setting up the things that they understand and that they're ready to do and so I feel

24:31.160 --> 24:37.520
like it had to go one way or another you know because inputting the same information twice

24:37.520 --> 24:44.840
during setup being installation and setup seems strange and frankly I don't know doesn't

24:44.840 --> 24:48.680
really make much sense because you're like oh you already have the information why don't

24:48.680 --> 24:56.980
you just skip this and so it had to go one way or another and it seems like the proper

24:56.980 --> 25:03.200
way is to have the installer handle installer specific stuff have the GNOME initial setup

25:03.200 --> 25:08.240
handle the user configuration stuff and I think we found a fine line there and I think

25:08.240 --> 25:11.280
that that's probably the best way to go.

25:11.280 --> 25:18.360
Fair enough I disagree but I can see the arguments for it so yeah okay so let's wrap it up with

25:18.360 --> 25:24.400
Beaker and reading from a motherboard article here the concept behind Beaker is similar

25:24.400 --> 25:29.280
to torrent file sharing a user can create a site on their local machine by opening menu

25:29.280 --> 25:33.160
and clicking a single button which creates a folder on the hard drive that can be shared

25:33.160 --> 25:37.060
over the internet with other Beaker users via URL.

25:37.060 --> 25:44.840
So this is a browser that aims to completely decentralize the web now you could say well

25:44.840 --> 25:49.600
the web is supposed to be decentralized anyway isn't it it already is why do we need this

25:49.600 --> 25:56.400
extra thing and the argument is that you've got things like AWS and as you're and you've

25:56.400 --> 26:03.280
got centralization happening so I mean the technicalities of this I don't think we need

26:03.280 --> 26:08.200
to get into it's pretty cool I've tried it out you do have to build it from you have

26:08.200 --> 26:13.420
to clone the git repository and build it it's not too difficult to do it this is clearly

26:13.420 --> 26:19.160
just for developers at this stage it's not for consumers but for me the what's interesting

26:19.160 --> 26:25.180
is the concept here of a decentralized web do we need it more decentralized than it is

26:25.180 --> 26:28.840
I don't know I'm struggling to see the argument really.

26:28.840 --> 26:35.480
So on ironically on motherboard there's a documentary a short documentary I think it's

26:35.480 --> 26:42.320
like 20 or 30 minutes long that features my friend Isaac he was working on at Occupy Wall

26:42.320 --> 26:49.480
Street and it's covered pretty well there he talks about you know how the web is a lot

26:49.480 --> 26:56.760
more centralized than it once was and how when it comes to things like things that companies

26:56.760 --> 27:01.480
may not feel comfortable with being on the web it's very easy to shut them down even

27:01.480 --> 27:07.680
if they're just a instance of free speech or whatever you know not necessarily anything

27:07.680 --> 27:14.380
criminal and that got me thinking more about this back that was in 2012 that we started

27:14.380 --> 27:21.360
talking about this and so I've used zero net I've used I can't remember the name of the

27:21.360 --> 27:24.960
other one there's another popular one now that's you know part of this decentralized

27:24.960 --> 27:31.320
web push I haven't used beaker but I have seen it before I've seen the project page

27:31.320 --> 27:36.840
I think I think honestly this is moving the world in the positive direction I don't like

27:36.840 --> 27:44.920
the idea of like any good Linux user I suppose I don't like the idea of losing out on on

27:44.920 --> 27:50.920
my my freedom because some company says that this doesn't meet their content policy or

27:50.920 --> 27:57.480
or you know you could have AWS say we don't want this hosted on our servers whatever and

27:57.480 --> 28:01.920
it could be not necessarily like I said criminal or anything it's just something that they

28:01.920 --> 28:06.840
don't want to have to to defend you know like when someone says like why do you host that

28:06.840 --> 28:13.080
on your infrastructure so I think this is ultimately good and as a positive thing for

28:13.080 --> 28:18.280
for free speech I as far as like which one of these projects will raise rise above the

28:18.280 --> 28:24.160
rest this looks cool zero net looks cool they all look cool I don't like them being browser

28:24.160 --> 28:29.840
specific though and I don't think zero net is but you have to run like a script and and

28:29.840 --> 28:35.120
you have to I think you might have to use Firefox but I would rather just have it be

28:35.120 --> 28:38.800
something that you can access well that's the thing there's a huge barrier to entry

28:38.800 --> 28:43.520
at the moment and you have to be very technical to do it the idea of normal people using this

28:43.520 --> 28:48.840
stuff is it feels a long way off and that to me is what we need to crack it's all one

28:48.840 --> 28:54.260
and good to have it in a nice technical implementation that works well if you know what you're doing

28:54.260 --> 28:59.880
but it needs to be as simple as open Chrome type in address or Google search the thing

28:59.880 --> 29:05.120
that you're looking for an open up website right right I agree 100% I think that will

29:05.120 --> 29:11.520
be the barrier I could see this being really helpful for journalists too and I say that

29:11.520 --> 29:15.440
in a more broad sense you know people who are covering things that that a government

29:15.440 --> 29:21.800
or company may not want out in the open and so I think ultimately it's a net good for

29:21.800 --> 29:26.680
technology and society but yeah the barrier to entry is pretty high and some of the people

29:26.680 --> 29:32.320
who would benefit most from this may be among those users who find it difficult to set this

29:32.320 --> 29:37.320
up and get started that's something they'll have to be overcome before this really takes

29:37.320 --> 29:44.280
off yeah well time gets away from us so we'd better wrap it up you can check out linuxactionnews.com
