00:00.000 --> 00:16.080
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.080 --> 00:20.360
This is episode 26, recorded on November 5th, 2017.

00:20.360 --> 00:21.360
I'm Chris.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.360
And I'm Joe.

00:22.360 --> 00:23.360
Hello, Joe.

00:23.360 --> 00:27.440
Remember, remember, it is the 5th of November, so watch out for those fireworks.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.280
And let's jump into our first news story this week.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.400
We've got a roadmap for Plasma Mobile.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.880
Yes, and a very sensible one at that.

00:34.880 --> 00:42.160
So Sebastian Kuehgler, I think is his name, has blogged about this roadmap.

00:42.160 --> 00:47.320
And it just makes total sense that they've got these various stages, prototype first,

00:47.320 --> 00:51.200
which they've already got, then a feature phone, then a basic smartphone, and then a

00:51.200 --> 00:52.800
featured smartphone.

00:52.800 --> 00:56.600
And as usual, there's a very humble tone to it.

00:56.600 --> 01:00.680
It's not trying to say that we're this amazing thing, it's trying to say, we've got this

01:00.680 --> 01:01.680
great potential.

01:01.680 --> 01:05.240
And if everyone comes and helps and helps shepherd it the way they want, it could be

01:05.240 --> 01:06.240
something amazing.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.260
Yeah, that's exactly the word I was thinking of.

01:08.260 --> 01:09.260
Also realistic.

01:09.260 --> 01:13.580
They say their development strategy is to build a basic system and platform around their

01:13.580 --> 01:16.100
core values and then extend on that.

01:16.100 --> 01:20.040
And when I said realistic, I like their timeline, they're saying we don't have a specific timeline

01:20.040 --> 01:22.000
for this roadmap for two main reasons.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.760
For one, it's a participatory project, so we need more help and the more help we get,

01:26.760 --> 01:27.760
the faster it'll get done.

01:27.760 --> 01:29.480
So that's going to have an impact.

01:29.480 --> 01:34.360
Secondly, they say we don't want to deliver half-ass software just because we set a timeline.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.440
We want to create quality software to build products upon.

01:37.440 --> 01:38.440
Seems pretty realistic.

01:38.440 --> 01:40.040
Yeah, very realistic.

01:40.040 --> 01:45.800
And one thing that jumped out at me was that they would consider Android app support.

01:45.800 --> 01:51.240
Obviously that's way down the line for the kind of the final featured smartphone, but

01:51.240 --> 01:54.000
at least they're not dismissing it like Ubuntu did.

01:54.000 --> 01:59.560
Pig-headedly, they would say Shot of Worth was not interested in having Android app support,

01:59.560 --> 02:05.200
which okay, would have been harder at the time for Ubuntu phone and now it's getting

02:05.200 --> 02:09.040
a little bit easier, but I think that is a very reasonable goal.

02:09.040 --> 02:14.760
If you want people to use your system, then you're going to have to have Android app support.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.040
Look at Sailfish.

02:16.040 --> 02:20.600
That's what has allowed that to become, okay, it's a very small niche, but at least it's

02:20.600 --> 02:22.160
starting to slowly take off.

02:22.160 --> 02:25.240
And I think that a big part of that is the fact that you can run at least some Android

02:25.240 --> 02:26.240
apps on it.

02:26.240 --> 02:31.640
Yeah, it seems in 2017 and early 2018, if you're going to ship a mobile product, that's

02:31.640 --> 02:32.640
a fundamental must.

02:32.640 --> 02:37.440
You have to have that big app ecosystem or no one in the featured smartphone category

02:37.440 --> 02:38.680
is going to want it.

02:38.680 --> 02:39.680
Yeah, exactly.

02:39.680 --> 02:43.940
I initially started as a skeptic of the Plasma mobile project, but reading through this blog

02:43.940 --> 02:48.200
post, which we'll have linked in the show notes at linuxactionnews.com slash 26, I'm

02:48.200 --> 02:53.080
on board, and this steady pace of improvement should be just in time for the Purism folks.

02:53.080 --> 02:56.160
Well, that's certainly what they're hoping.

02:56.160 --> 03:02.160
So Matthias Klump, who is a PureOS developer at Purism, has blogged about testing Plasma

03:02.160 --> 03:07.160
mobile on an i.mx6 test board.

03:07.160 --> 03:12.400
And it's all basic stuff, and he says it doesn't run that well, but it's kind of the first

03:12.400 --> 03:19.320
step towards actually getting a proper operating system and a good UI running on a device.

03:19.320 --> 03:23.840
It looks more tablet-sized rather than phone-sized, but that's not the point of this.

03:23.840 --> 03:27.680
This, as I said, is very much the first step.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.200
This is about working out the kinks.

03:29.200 --> 03:36.160
This is about getting Kaywin and Wayland working on this thing, getting their Debian testing-based

03:36.160 --> 03:38.480
operating system booting on this thing.

03:38.480 --> 03:41.040
And it's good to see this progress, really.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.680
But there was a bit of a red flag in this blog post.

03:43.680 --> 03:44.920
I don't know if you noticed it.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.280
No, I don't think I did.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.280
What was it?

03:47.280 --> 03:54.360
He says, last weekend, I did an initial experiment in getting Plasma mobile working on this i.mx6.

03:54.360 --> 03:58.320
Now they've just completed their crowd funder.

03:58.320 --> 04:02.000
They've just got their $2 million plus.

04:02.000 --> 04:08.160
Why is this guy working on it at the weekend and not during his work days?

04:08.160 --> 04:12.160
It seems like the kind of thing that he should be getting paid in his work day to do.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.240
Am I reading too much into that?

04:14.240 --> 04:19.840
Maybe we could chalk it up to some enthusiasm and say that he was getting all excited about

04:19.840 --> 04:23.100
going into work on Monday and getting this thing working.

04:23.100 --> 04:24.200
How about that?

04:24.200 --> 04:28.160
Maybe or maybe they have flexible work hours or something.

04:28.160 --> 04:32.680
It seems a little bit hobbyist, and that worries me.

04:32.680 --> 04:36.960
If they're going to do this, if they're going to pull off this huge task of getting a mobile

04:36.960 --> 04:44.480
operating system and a phone that's totally independent to market, then they need to really

04:44.480 --> 04:49.480
be serious about it and not do it in a kind of amateur hobbyist way.

04:49.480 --> 04:50.480
That's true.

04:50.480 --> 04:52.240
I completely agree.

04:52.240 --> 04:55.400
For all we know, perhaps this kind of experiment is more fun when you can have the hookah pipe

04:55.400 --> 04:58.280
with them and they don't have hookah at the office.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.920
Yeah, maybe.

04:59.920 --> 05:03.360
Maybe I'm being too picky here.

05:03.360 --> 05:07.560
Maybe it's just that it arrived last thing on a Friday afternoon or something and he

05:07.560 --> 05:11.320
took it home and carried on working on it.

05:11.320 --> 05:12.800
I say stay skeptical.

05:12.800 --> 05:13.800
Yeah.

05:13.800 --> 05:17.360
Well, let's hope that they are very serious about it because they're going to need to

05:17.360 --> 05:18.360
be.

05:18.360 --> 05:22.320
The Mozilla Foundation is getting serious about boosting privacy in an upcoming version

05:22.320 --> 05:23.880
of Firefox.

05:23.880 --> 05:30.080
Version 58, which is expected in January of 2018, is going to have a feature that I'm

05:30.080 --> 05:31.080
looking forward to.

05:31.080 --> 05:37.640
Yeah, they're going to block browser canvas fingerprinting, which uses HTML5 specs to

05:37.640 --> 05:42.840
basically take a snapshot of the browser and then to assign a unique or potentially unique

05:42.840 --> 05:46.120
fingerprint which identifies you.

05:46.120 --> 05:50.520
My first question would be, why is this even a thing?

05:50.520 --> 05:54.440
Why hasn't this been stopped by Mozilla a long time ago?

05:54.440 --> 05:56.380
That's kind of a fascinating story.

05:56.380 --> 06:01.780
This effort was really pioneered by the Tor project for their Tor browser, which is of

06:01.780 --> 06:03.920
course built on top of Firefox.

06:03.920 --> 06:06.540
It's almost all Firefox.

06:06.540 --> 06:10.440
They came up with this solution over there and Mozilla sort of took a look at it and

06:10.440 --> 06:14.940
said, yeah, okay, this is something we'd be willing to do.

06:14.940 --> 06:16.920
This isn't really going to solve the problem either.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.920
I have to be completely honest because there's been talks of blocking this kind of stuff

06:20.920 --> 06:26.080
for a while and so trackers are already coming up with new methodologies.

06:26.080 --> 06:31.080
They call it a fingerprint because it's essentially pretty statistically close to identifying

06:31.080 --> 06:32.080
you.

06:32.080 --> 06:37.480
It has a good, good, good chance that it's you and it looks at things like your fonts,

06:37.480 --> 06:42.760
your WebGL capabilities, the window size you have, the resolution, it takes all of these

06:42.760 --> 06:49.320
attributes that the HTML canvas spec can get access to and it puts it all together, generates

06:49.320 --> 06:54.480
a hash and then that hash becomes the fingerprint and they create a database and that gets shared

06:54.480 --> 06:56.080
and they get to sell it for money.

06:56.080 --> 07:00.140
It's a real racket we all should have gotten into and then they can use that to track you

07:00.140 --> 07:04.360
across different sites, even when you have certain types of tracking turned off.

07:04.360 --> 07:09.040
Yeah, and it means that at least in the case of Tor, they can tell who you are potentially

07:09.040 --> 07:14.840
because they can compare your Tor usage with your regular Firefox usage, but as you say,

07:14.840 --> 07:19.060
this is an arms race, so I think it is important that they've done it, but there are other

07:19.060 --> 07:22.240
things that they are going to have to stay on top of as well.

07:22.240 --> 07:27.900
Speaking of Tor, just a quick mention for Linux and Mac users of Tor in the audience.

07:27.900 --> 07:30.480
Keep an eye out for an update coming soon.

07:30.480 --> 07:36.320
Tor M oil, which is a flaw that's been discovered in Tor, is triggered when users click on links

07:36.320 --> 07:41.560
that begin with file colon slash slash and this is applicable on Mac OS or Linux.

07:41.560 --> 07:45.520
It was applicable on Windows, it's already been patched and it allows the operating system

07:45.520 --> 07:49.600
to directly connect to the remote host and bypass the Tor browser.

07:49.600 --> 07:54.040
The VR segment was the security research firm that found this and the Tor project says that

07:54.040 --> 07:58.320
in the meantime, use the stable release, don't click on file colon slash slash links and

07:58.320 --> 08:00.160
keep an eye out for an update very soon.

08:00.160 --> 08:04.120
Well, to channel Alan Jude, patch your shit.

08:04.120 --> 08:07.560
So Canonical has joined the GNOME Advisory Board.

08:07.560 --> 08:13.300
Yeah, the GNOME Foundation announced on November 1st that Canonical, as they put it, the creator

08:13.300 --> 08:17.800
of the Ubuntu operating system, has joined the GNOME Foundation Advisory Board and the

08:17.800 --> 08:22.080
board now includes companies like Google, the Linux Foundation, the Free Software Foundation

08:22.080 --> 08:23.280
and others.

08:23.280 --> 08:27.720
This was pretty much inevitable, wasn't it, when they made the switch to GNOME and it's

08:27.720 --> 08:33.240
good to see that they are not sort of shirking their responsibility and they are taking this

08:33.240 --> 08:38.400
desktop stuff seriously, even though some of us, including me, thought that they weren't

08:38.400 --> 08:40.060
going to do that.

08:40.060 --> 08:41.060
So fair play to them.

08:41.060 --> 08:44.920
They are living up to their responsibilities and contributing to GNOME where they should

08:44.920 --> 08:45.920
be.

08:45.920 --> 08:49.200
In the long term, I'll be looking to see how much influence do they get?

08:49.200 --> 08:55.060
Do they get a full representation at the council and will Canonical be able to bring over some

08:55.060 --> 08:59.960
of their user study data from Unity and Unity 8 that they conducted even more recently to

08:59.960 --> 09:00.960
GNOME?

09:00.960 --> 09:01.960
And could that be helpful in some way?

09:01.960 --> 09:05.700
Those are things that were recently sort of hinted at by Will Cook, the Ubuntu desktop

09:05.700 --> 09:09.560
manager on Linux Unplugged, and I think that stuff could be pretty useful because it's

09:09.560 --> 09:17.040
not often that open source projects pay for real user testing.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.120
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

09:19.120 --> 09:23.160
You go there to support this show and you get a free seven-day trial to a platform that's

09:23.160 --> 09:27.680
built by Linux geeks, educators, and developers to teach you more about Linux.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.900
It's a full-featured training library with everything you need to learn new skills and

09:31.900 --> 09:36.840
advance your career with self-paced in-depth video courses, hands-on scenario-based labs,

09:36.840 --> 09:39.960
learning paths, which are content that's been planned by their instructors for specific

09:39.960 --> 09:40.960
career tasks.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.660
Oh, and real human instructors that are available to help you whenever you need help.

09:44.660 --> 09:48.640
And if it's time for a certification, they've got courses created specifically to prepare

09:48.640 --> 09:50.160
you for those exams.

09:50.160 --> 09:55.600
They also have practice exams and quizzes, flashcards, all kinds of little nuggets they

09:55.600 --> 10:00.120
call them, tiny bits of wisdom if you just want a deep dive on a topic, iOS and Android

10:00.120 --> 10:01.480
apps for the go.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.280
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

10:04.280 --> 10:09.200
A platform to learn more about every Linux cloud and DevOps topic.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.400
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

10:11.400 --> 10:18.440
Okay, let's talk about Bitcoin and an article that jumped out at me this week.

10:18.440 --> 10:21.380
Little bit clickbaity, but that doesn't change the facts.

10:21.380 --> 10:26.520
And the headline of this is one Bitcoin transaction now uses as much energy as your house in a

10:26.520 --> 10:28.800
week.

10:28.800 --> 10:36.160
So doing the maths of how many transactions there are, which is currently around 300,000

10:36.160 --> 10:41.700
per day, and looking at the difficulty level and how much electricity is actually needed

10:41.700 --> 10:49.080
to mine Bitcoin, which is basically just processing transactions, that's the crux of it, works

10:49.080 --> 10:58.280
out at 215 kilowatt hours per transaction, which is ridiculous.

10:58.280 --> 11:05.160
In the UK, the average price is about 13 pence per kilowatt hour, which means that each transaction

11:05.160 --> 11:12.520
is costing about 30 pounds worth of electricity per transaction, not per Bitcoin mined.

11:12.520 --> 11:18.200
And it just goes to show that, okay, I know traditional servers use a lot of power and

11:18.200 --> 11:22.840
banks have a lot of servers and all the rest of it, but this is just ridiculous.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.240
I'll give you my red flag on this.

11:24.240 --> 11:31.960
So this is a piece over at Motherboard, which is quoting a blog post over at DigiCommunist,

11:31.960 --> 11:41.800
which is citing a published report by IEA.org, which is the International Energy Agency and

11:41.800 --> 11:46.920
their key world energy statistics for 2017, which is only available as a PDF, a 97-page

11:46.920 --> 11:48.260
PDF.

11:48.260 --> 11:50.920
And so this is several layers abstracted.

11:50.920 --> 11:56.360
And so in this, you lose the nuance of what kind of hardware is doing the mining.

11:56.360 --> 11:59.200
Is this based on CPU calculations?

11:59.200 --> 12:00.860
Is this based on GPU?

12:00.860 --> 12:02.740
Is this based on ASIC?

12:02.740 --> 12:06.600
Is it based on all cryptocurrencies like Litecoin and Ethereum?

12:06.600 --> 12:10.360
Is it based only on Bitcoin and which fork of Bitcoin?

12:10.360 --> 12:15.200
These are all questions that fundamentally alter the amount of energy that is being consumed

12:15.200 --> 12:17.360
by a miner.

12:17.360 --> 12:22.520
And so a GPU miner would use considerably more power than, say, an ASIC miner, which

12:22.520 --> 12:26.080
is a purpose-built processor and it's much more efficient.

12:26.080 --> 12:30.080
And you have to be very clear on the type of hardware doing the mining to be able to

12:30.080 --> 12:32.080
derive the correct amount of power consumption.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.000
Well, that is true.

12:34.000 --> 12:40.200
But even if it's an order of magnitude less than that, that's still pretty bad.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.200
I would agree.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.760
It's probably still got to be pretty outrageous.

12:42.760 --> 12:48.760
Back in my heyday of Bitcoin mining, I literally warmed my garage studio with several Bitcoin

12:48.760 --> 12:49.760
miners.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.560
So I converted essentially that into heat.

12:51.560 --> 12:55.800
I would have been running heaters anyways, and this allowed me to run less heaters.

12:55.800 --> 12:59.640
There is some justification in that, I suppose.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.960
This is going to come to a head, though, if cryptocurrencies become even more popular than

13:02.960 --> 13:03.960
there are today.

13:03.960 --> 13:09.520
I will point out a couple of possible advantages that cryptocurrencies have over other traditional

13:09.520 --> 13:11.220
stores of value.

13:11.220 --> 13:14.760
Information for cryptocurrencies potentially could be powered by renewable sources.

13:14.760 --> 13:21.760
Say here in Washington, predominantly our electricity is rather cheap because it's hydroelectricity.

13:21.760 --> 13:27.900
There's no renewable resource for gold or other precious materials that we mine from the Earth

13:27.900 --> 13:30.520
that are also considered stores of value.

13:30.520 --> 13:35.960
Bitcoin is the one that we have invented ourselves based on math that could actually be powered

13:35.960 --> 13:37.040
by the sun.

13:37.040 --> 13:38.640
It's potentially possible.

13:38.640 --> 13:42.000
But I would think it would have to get popular enough that there would be a market to demand

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
that.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.000
Well, that is true.

13:44.000 --> 13:48.920
And as I said, all the fiat currencies fly around the world from server to server.

13:48.920 --> 13:54.600
And gold hasn't had much to do with currencies for quite a long time now.

13:54.600 --> 13:59.880
But I have an instinct that the fiat currencies are using less power than this.

13:59.880 --> 14:04.280
Maybe I'm totally off base, and maybe this is a drop in the ocean compared to what the

14:04.280 --> 14:07.680
dollar uses or whatever and the various exchanges.

14:07.680 --> 14:13.480
But it just seems that in an age where people are very concerned about energy usage and

14:13.480 --> 14:18.400
trying to move over to renewables and stuff and cutting energy usage where you can, it

14:18.400 --> 14:21.440
just seems like an awful waste of electricity to me.

14:21.440 --> 14:26.520
Would it be great if it was also going towards solving big problems like sort of how SETI

14:26.520 --> 14:29.000
at home or some of the cancer research?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.680
Yeah, folding at home, that sort of thing.

14:30.680 --> 14:31.680
Yeah.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.440
And there are actually some cryptocurrencies around that, but they're just not nearly as

14:34.440 --> 14:37.240
popular as the ones that just grind out hard math problems.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.240
Yeah.

14:38.240 --> 14:43.120
It's a shame that that wasn't really thought of in the initial design of Bitcoin because

14:43.120 --> 14:47.840
that would have basically alleviated my concerns on this.

14:47.840 --> 14:48.840
Maybe there's hope, Joe.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.400
In the meantime, we have a zombie among us.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.360
SCO versus IBM is not dead yet.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.360
Surely.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.360
Surely it must be dead.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.360
No.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.920
It was dead years ago, wasn't it?

14:58.920 --> 14:59.920
No.

14:59.920 --> 15:00.920
Nope.

15:00.920 --> 15:01.920
This is the story that won't die.

15:01.920 --> 15:07.800
It all started off in 2003 and the dispute centers on Project Monterey, a joint effort

15:07.800 --> 15:13.180
by SCO and IBM to build a unified Unix capable of running on several different microprocessor

15:13.180 --> 15:16.160
architectures, but it eventually went bust.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.080
And that's sort of the heart, the crux of the matter.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.080
Yeah.

15:20.080 --> 15:27.520
So SCO decided to sue IBM over various different aspects of it, saying that IBM had taken proprietary

15:27.520 --> 15:33.760
code from them and given it to the Linux community effectively, and that that was undermining

15:33.760 --> 15:35.880
their business as a result.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.360
And it's just gone back and forth.

15:37.360 --> 15:43.280
We've had so many court cases about this and we think that it's over and then it just somehow

15:43.280 --> 15:44.980
gets resurrected.

15:44.980 --> 15:50.740
This is sort of an interesting one, though, because there is a bit of a possible crack

15:50.740 --> 15:54.280
in the system for SCO to wiggle its way in.

15:54.280 --> 16:00.480
It really all hinges on this misappropriation of their original code in a Monterey, which

16:00.480 --> 16:04.800
then IBM was able to point to and say, there's existing public code out there.

16:04.800 --> 16:09.280
We just contributed code to AIX and Linux that was already public.

16:09.280 --> 16:16.040
The problem is, according to SCO, there was never an official or formal partnership or

16:16.040 --> 16:20.280
joint venture as a matter of law to do this.

16:20.280 --> 16:26.040
They were considered on good business relationship terms, which apparently is a legal thing,

16:26.040 --> 16:31.160
but there was no agreement for this code exchange and then it eventually becoming public.

16:31.160 --> 16:33.420
It was like a handshake, I guess.

16:33.420 --> 16:37.680
But this is only a partial success for SCO, really, because they were trying to pursue

16:37.680 --> 16:42.800
three different cases effectively, or three different aspects to the case, and only one

16:42.800 --> 16:48.440
of them has been ruled to be worthy of continued challenge.

16:48.440 --> 16:52.920
And that is the one about the intellectual property, whereas the kind of bigger one about

16:52.920 --> 17:00.060
torturous interference, which is where they're alleging that IBM deliberately sabotaged

17:00.060 --> 17:05.480
their business practices, basically, by giving this code to the Linux community to make it

17:05.480 --> 17:13.480
so that Linux was a viable competitor in the enterprise space to SCO's proprietary Unix.

17:13.480 --> 17:17.480
That is not going to be allowed to be pursued, probably.

17:17.480 --> 17:23.160
So I don't think that this is as huge as some people think it is, basically.

17:23.160 --> 17:27.560
I think that it's not going to go away and they might make a few quid from IBM, but I

17:27.560 --> 17:31.120
don't think they're going to be going after the likes of Red Hat and making billions of

17:31.120 --> 17:32.440
dollars.

17:32.440 --> 17:37.020
Continuing from our Department of Legal Stories that you probably don't really want to follow,

17:37.020 --> 17:41.920
so we're going to read them for you, there is a bizarre legal action being filed against

17:41.920 --> 17:48.080
the Software Freedom Conservancy by, well, a former friend of theirs.

17:48.080 --> 17:51.320
Yeah, the Software Freedom Law Center.

17:51.320 --> 17:58.680
This is, on the face of it, very strange because the Software Freedom Law Center and Conservancy

17:58.680 --> 18:03.360
are often thought of in the same breath, really.

18:03.360 --> 18:06.600
They're considered to be almost the same thing by a lot of people.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.600
Indeed.

18:07.600 --> 18:15.080
The Software Freedom Law Center was the organization that helped launch the Software Freedom Conservancy.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.560
They're often thought together.

18:17.560 --> 18:21.840
This is the Software Freedom Law Center telling Conservancy that they want their trademark

18:21.840 --> 18:25.480
back, which is just very strange.

18:25.480 --> 18:32.680
It seems that there are things going on behind the scenes here that are not public.

18:32.680 --> 18:38.720
It must be because these people were friends and now they've clearly had a falling out.

18:38.720 --> 18:39.960
I completely agree, Joe.

18:39.960 --> 18:42.400
It's a week of red flags for you and I.

18:42.400 --> 18:47.960
This process was started by the Law Center, by the Software Freedom Law Center, on September

18:47.960 --> 18:48.960
22nd.

18:48.960 --> 18:52.000
This has been in the works for a little while.

18:52.000 --> 18:56.560
There is quite a bit of different theories behind the scenes about what's going on here.

18:56.560 --> 18:59.400
I don't know if I'm going to pick a particular theory at this point.

18:59.400 --> 19:02.120
I'm still doing my end of the research.

19:02.120 --> 19:06.920
This all came out on November 3rd and I find it very surprising.

19:06.920 --> 19:10.360
It's bizarre because these two organizations have been so closely linked.

19:10.360 --> 19:14.920
They haven't always agreed, especially some of the folks behind the scenes haven't always

19:14.920 --> 19:20.960
agreed with each other, but they've generally seen as trying to accomplish the same goal.

19:20.960 --> 19:25.700
Keeping in mind that the Software Freedom Law Center filed a petition on September 22nd,

19:25.700 --> 19:31.160
you can't help but note that the news of this came out just shortly after the new kernel

19:31.160 --> 19:36.920
enforcement statement that the Software Conservancy was strongly behind.

19:36.920 --> 19:44.720
The message of this enforcement statement was legal as a last action resort to be initiated

19:44.720 --> 19:48.400
only when other community efforts have failed to resolve the problem.

19:48.400 --> 19:54.800
That was the kernel developers and the conservancy agreeing that legal enforcement is the last

19:54.800 --> 19:59.200
action and we should try to make other things work first, take other avenues.

19:59.200 --> 20:02.040
Yeah, there's no way this is a coincidence.

20:02.040 --> 20:07.640
The Software Freedom Law Center clearly don't agree with the idea that lawsuits should be

20:07.640 --> 20:08.640
the last resort.

20:08.640 --> 20:13.800
But I think another thing that is key to this is if you go back to around that same time

20:13.800 --> 20:22.280
in September this year, Eben Moglen published a blog post that basically said that organizations

20:22.280 --> 20:26.160
like conservancy are pretty much irrelevant now.

20:26.160 --> 20:32.640
In this post, he talks about how in the early days of free software, it was quite easy to

20:32.640 --> 20:37.340
set up charitable status for these projects.

20:37.340 --> 20:42.320
They were making quite a good living out of that, I think, the Software Freedom Law Center.

20:42.320 --> 20:48.620
Then under the Obama administration, the IRS had some staff changes and that made it much

20:48.620 --> 20:52.280
more difficult to get this charitable status.

20:52.280 --> 20:58.160
That's why they set up organizations like conservancy to be an umbrella organization

20:58.160 --> 21:05.000
to help small free software projects with all the fiscal staff.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.120
He's now saying that the IRS staff has changed and now they're much more amenable.

21:09.120 --> 21:15.800
It's much easier for a smaller project to have financial independence effectively, helped

21:15.800 --> 21:20.640
of course by the Software Freedom Law Center who take their cut or at least get paid to

21:20.640 --> 21:23.360
do all the legal work for them.

21:23.360 --> 21:28.840
It could just boil down to that, that they want to start making a few quid again now

21:28.840 --> 21:29.840
that they can.

21:29.840 --> 21:30.840
It's possible.

21:30.840 --> 21:31.840
A little competitive edge.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.200
I'm not sure I buy that argument.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.240
It seems like a good public explanation.

21:36.240 --> 21:40.280
I'll give it that, but it doesn't make real sense if you think about it.

21:40.280 --> 21:45.280
The Software Freedom Conservancy would even have a place even if all of the IRS policies

21:45.280 --> 21:47.460
had lined up in favor of the law center.

21:47.460 --> 21:52.400
The reason I say that is you need something that is consistent in the storm and US politics

21:52.400 --> 21:59.040
can swing and a Democrat could come into office in four years or in eight years and the IRS

21:59.040 --> 22:02.600
policies could realign in a way that was hostile towards open source projects.

22:02.600 --> 22:08.000
You need a place like the conservancy to house projects like GIMP, which are over 20 years

22:08.000 --> 22:12.360
old and don't need to be subject to the whims of the US political system.

22:12.360 --> 22:13.920
Yeah, that is a good point.

22:13.920 --> 22:17.520
It just begs the question as what exactly has gone on here?

22:17.520 --> 22:21.780
What are the internal politics of these two organizations that have gone from being so

22:21.780 --> 22:26.440
cozy to now being so hostile to each other?

22:26.440 --> 22:32.000
It just seems very strange to me and I'm sure that we're going to hear more about this over

22:32.000 --> 22:36.680
the coming weeks and months because there's a story underneath here and it's going to

22:36.680 --> 22:38.760
come out one way or another.

22:38.760 --> 22:42.040
Indeed and when there's an interesting development in the story that we think you guys will want

22:42.040 --> 22:45.800
