00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,780
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,080
This is episode 25, recorded on October 29th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,360
I hope you're ready to get applications installed on your long-term support systems because

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,080
Mint is adding Flatpak support.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:37,080
Yeah, so Mint, which is a distro based on Ubuntu, is adding Flatpak and doesn't really

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,140
want to use Snap, which is a bit strange to me.

10
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,680
Why would you when you're based on Ubuntu?

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,680
That sounds complicated.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:52,400
Yeah, because I installed Linux Mint, the latest one, which is 18.2, I think, and it

13
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,400
didn't have SnapD by default.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:01:01,840
It's in the repos, of course, and I pulled it down and then I got, I think, Krita working

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,000
as a Snap, no problem, but it's just a bit strange that they are ignoring Snap in favor

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
of Flatpak.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,760
You know, I was wondering what that's about.

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,600
And so I was reading their announcement on, this is all part of Linux Mint 18.3.

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,120
It's going to come with full support for Flatpak out of the box, including integration into

20
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,220
the Linux Mint software manager.

21
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,600
And here's what the project wrote, Flatpak is very promising to us in its implementation.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,440
It's already very stable as far as they're concerned.

23
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:35,960
And one of the key advantages to Flatpak is that it doesn't have a, quote, middleman.

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,440
It's trivial for upstream software editors to distribute their software to Linux users

25
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,980
without having to care about a multitude of distributions or a middleman.

26
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:50,160
And it's easy for distributions like Mint to add their own repositories for future software

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
ideas.

28
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,640
In this case, it's a little bit harder with Snap, but you can do that, can't you?

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
Absolutely.

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
Yeah, you can absolutely.

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,800
You could come up with your own distribution for Snaps, absolutely.

32
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,960
Especially when you consider that Linux Mint develops their own software center.

33
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,600
So it would just be a simple HTTP Git, pull down the Snap and have the software manager

34
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
install it.

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
It would absolutely be possible.

36
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,000
I think this is maybe in part a political statement, but I think there is some merit

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,520
to going with Flatpak for Mint because it is solving a problem that is almost perfect

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
for Mint.

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,160
And it's that we want the PPA type approach, but we want to deliver current software on

40
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,200
top of a really old, potentially five-year-old base.

41
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,000
And it's not that Snaps aren't great for that, but if you're not running the central Snap

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,880
store, if you're not managing it, you want to create repos to deliver, say, Firefox for

43
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,920
the next five years, with Flatpaks, you can do that.

44
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,760
And you can still contain all the GTK dependencies and any of the extra stuff that your base

45
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,600
LTS doesn't necessarily have the right version of.

46
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:59,480
Yeah, but it kind of feels at this point to me like they're backing Betamax rather than

47
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
VHS.

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,200
I agree that momentum around Flatpak seems to have slowed down a bit and momentum around

49
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Snaps has increased.

50
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,040
But as long as it's possible to install Snap support on Mint, as an end user, I can still

51
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,200
take advantage of whichever one has the most momentum with the most apps.

52
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,680
And if maybe it's both of them, then you're better off.

53
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,720
And what we might end up with is some distributions by default will prefer Snaps, and some distributions

54
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,280
by default will support Flatpak.

55
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,440
What is a bit different in the implementations right now is, say, Ubuntu, for example.

56
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,320
That would be the obvious example.

57
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,240
It comes out of the box with Snap support.

58
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,360
But that is not in detriment to Flatpak support.

59
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,200
It has full first-class support for Flatpak as well.

60
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,280
And that seems to be the better approach, just support them both and let the market

61
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
decide.

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
But maybe I'm crazy, Joe.

63
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,680
Yeah, that does make sense.

64
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,480
I don't know why Mint doesn't have SnapD installed by default.

65
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,280
It's not a huge amount of room on the disk to have it.

66
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,400
And why not just have it there as a command line-only option for power users, for want

67
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
of a better word.

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,880
I suppose it's not hard to apt-get install it, but for my money, yeah, just have both.

69
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,480
Have Flatpak and Snap, integrate them both into the software center, and then give people

70
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
the choice.

71
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,720
But I suppose that is more work.

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,040
And it's probably a lot less work to just pick one and take your gamble, but I just

73
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,440
think they've gambled on the wrong thing here.

74
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,080
If I were to speculate, I would say that's exactly what it is.

75
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,120
They are focusing, which has been a criticism of mine in the past.

76
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,360
The Mint project has taken on a lot of extra projects.

77
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,560
You have the Debian edition, you have the KDE edition, you have the Xapps, you have

78
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,000
their main desktop, you have Cinnamon.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,980
There's a lot there for them to work on.

80
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,920
And what we might be seeing here is Clem or the project saying, we're going to narrow

81
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
our focus.

82
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,800
And we're going to say we support this really well, and that'll be our main focus.

83
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
So this is what we're going to put our weight behind.

84
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,280
And that might be why we see them discontinuing their KDE edition as well.

85
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
Yeah.

86
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,080
So in this same newsletter, they also announced that they're dropping KDE as an addition,

87
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,200
which kind of makes sense to me.

88
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Because if you want KDE or Plasma on top of Ubuntu, you've already got two pretty solid

89
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,800
choices in Kubuntu or KDE Neon.

90
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,560
Do you really need a third one with Mint?

91
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Absolutely.

92
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
And they're doing this the right way.

93
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,240
They're going to continue one more release cycle.

94
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,240
So 18.3 will ship with a KDE spin, but there won't be any after that.

95
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,320
So there is a window of time for existing users to make a migration.

96
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:38,280
And really, at least unless something dramatically changes, you could still use the Kubuntu PPAs

97
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,880
on your Mint system and install KDE Plasma desktop that way.

98
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,040
But at that point, what's the point?

99
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,280
Why not just use Kubuntu?

100
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
Just don't know really.

101
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Yeah, I agree.

102
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,980
I think the Plasma desktop distro landscape, if you will, has changed with really Neon.

103
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:59,120
When KDE Neon came out, I think it's changed the competitive landscape for Plasma desktops.

104
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,640
And I applaud Mint doing this because I think focusing is the right move for them.

105
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,320
They can maintain less focus on what they do right.

106
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,680
And people have other options that are solid, including existing Mint users.

107
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,540
And the fact that they're going to do one more release, that's just the icing on top

108
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,540
of all of this.

109
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,880
So I think this is a great move.

110
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
Yeah.

111
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,740
I think that the Mate edition should probably be next, given you've got Ubuntu Mate now

112
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,040
that didn't exist when Linux Mint Mate edition came along.

113
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,920
But I think it's probably quite popular still.

114
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,400
But I think they should just focus on Cinnamon and just be the Cinnamon distro.

115
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,480
But it's up to them, I suppose, if they want to spread themselves a little bit thinner

116
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
than that.

117
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,560
But for me, you've got to add value.

118
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,200
If you're going to be an Ubuntu derivative, you've got to add some value there.

119
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,840
And how do you do that?

120
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,440
By focusing, in my opinion.

121
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,480
And Cinnamon is its own thing that isn't widely used elsewhere.

122
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,360
It's kind of available on some other distros, but it's not kind of the flagship of any others.

123
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,200
So just concentrate on that, make it as good as it can possibly be, and don't waste time

124
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,000
duplicating effort like a KDE edition.

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Pretty much.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,840
We just did a new release of Cinnamon.

127
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,040
I'm going to try to give that a look in this week's Linux Unplugged and kick the tires

128
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
and report back.

129
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,440
And you know, with all this extra time and focus, Joe, maybe they can focus on adding

130
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,920
ZFS support to Linux.

131
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:29,540
Because if one Oracle employee has his way, real Oracle-developed ZFS may become a first

132
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:32,240
class upstream Linux file system.

133
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,400
Yeah, now, I was almost reluctant to put this in the show, because to me, this feels like

134
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
a non-story.

135
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:47,140
But at the Open ZFS Developer Summit 2017, Mark Maybe implied that Oracle are thinking

136
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,880
about changing the license, or at least it would be possible for them to change the license,

137
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,540
let's say, to make it compatible with the GPL.

138
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,640
Because at the moment, it's not.

139
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,480
According to some people, according to Ubuntu, it is.

140
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,880
It's all a bit of a complicated situation.

141
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,720
If Oracle changed the license to something that is compatible with GPLv2, then we could

142
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,120
have proper upstream support for ZFS.

143
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,920
And this has caused a lot of people to get excited about it, but I just cannot see this

144
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
happening.

145
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,040
Yeah, he couches it a bit more as his presentation goes on.

146
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,300
But he did say one thing that made me pause and go, hmm, okay, maybe there's some real

147
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,720
fire to the smoke.

148
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:35,840
He said that this is in light of recent reduced investment in Solaris, quote.

149
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,120
And as they have reduced investment in Solaris and focused more on cloud, which legitimately

150
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,840
that is something Oracle has done a lot this year, ZFS on Linux has come up more and more

151
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,120
internally in conversations.

152
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:54,680
And Mark Maybe has been an employee of Oracle since 1998, so he isn't like a spokesperson

153
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,440
for the company, but he's probably pretty well acquainted with some of the conversations

154
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
there.

155
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,160
And he brought up ZFS or ZFS, as we say here in the States, on Linux a few more times during

156
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
his talk.

157
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,400
And in fact, he maybe even talked about it more than he talked about Solaris, really,

158
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
which is kind of funny.

159
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,100
And he said, next, what may not happen in the past, well, that could still happen with

160
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,160
an Oracle.

161
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,040
And he said, he personally, as a ZFS developer at Oracle, wants to see ZFS become a core

162
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,720
part of Linux.

163
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,640
He wants it to become the file system of Linux.

164
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,380
And he said that could happen for, quote unquote, core Linux.

165
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,920
It's a possibility, he says.

166
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,120
Well, he might also want world peace.

167
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,520
And that might also be a possibility, but he's still dreaming if he thinks it's going

168
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,520
to happen.

169
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,880
In the meantime, open ZFS seems to work pretty damn great on Linux.

170
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,880
I get emails from listeners all the time that have massive storage setups on Linux using

171
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
open ZFS.

172
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:53,000
Yeah, and is soon going to be available on Windows, by the looks of things, which isn't

173
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,280
massively interesting.

174
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:59,880
But it just shows that the development is there, the interest is there, and the proof

175
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,120
of concept is available on GitHub.

176
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,460
Yeah, this is from an open ZFS contributor at that same conference we just mentioned.

177
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,760
And Brian Contrell, who has been a repeat and favorite guest of the BSD Now show, tweeted

178
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,560
out a picture of it happening.

179
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
It's early support.

180
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,640
Like, right now, it's currently missing the ZFS volume support and the ability to compile

181
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,560
ZFS on top of ZFS.

182
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,440
But other than a few remaining bugs, it's pretty damn close.

183
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:29,240
And we're going to be in a reality where you can hook up a ZFS array to a Windows box and

184
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,600
read the data very soon.

185
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,240
Yeah, and that's going to help adoption, even if it's just a tiny bit.

186
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,720
The more platforms it's available on, the more adoption you're going to have.

187
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,620
Speaking of Microsoft, this reminded me of Microsoft from the good old days.

188
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:48,600
Google Play Protect is dead last at fingering malware on a survey that was conducted on

189
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Android.

190
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,440
Google Play Protect, which is Google's...

191
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
Windows defender?

192
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Well, kind of.

193
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,720
But it uses machine learning to constantly scan your device and scan everyone's devices

194
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,840
to see if any apps are behaving badly.

195
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Oh, really?

196
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Machine learning.

197
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,880
So it must be really accurate then, Joe.

198
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,640
Yeah, except not.

199
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:15,960
Because as you said, they came dead last of 20 antivirus systems that AV Test tested,

200
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,800
which is just not good at all, is it?

201
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,360
No, I can't even believe we're talking about AV on Android.

202
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,420
And I guess this is a thing.

203
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,540
This is an article we'll have linked in the show notes so you can read more if you care.

204
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:33,320
But six of the 20 software suites sampled correctly flagged every single one as a threat.

205
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,540
So they did pretty good, but only six of 20 managed that far.

206
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,160
Eight more managed 99%.

207
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
That's pretty solid.

208
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,800
But Google's own system, Play Protect, which Google bills as the only solution you need

209
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,960
to protect Android, it only detected 65.8% of threats.

210
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,800
This really reminds me of Windows Defender and the Microsoft days when they got into

211
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
antivirus.

212
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
It's Windows all over again.

213
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,520
Yeah, I remember when I first got into Linux, thinking, wow, this is great, I don't need

214
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,400
to use antivirus anymore.

215
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:09,020
And I heard the argument at the time that, well, if Linux was as popular as Windows,

216
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,360
in terms of desktop market share, then people would be making malware for it and people

217
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,560
would be exploiting it.

218
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,880
Now I question that to some extent because of the way that Linux is built.

219
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,560
I think it's a better designed system.

220
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,020
But there was never really a test of that because it wasn't widespread.

221
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,800
Now I know that Android is not desktop Linux.

222
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
It's got a Linux kernel.

223
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,880
It's a very different system.

224
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,400
But here we have mass adoption of Linux in consumer devices.

225
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:42,760
And now we're starting to see malware for it, which kind of goes to show that if you've

226
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,760
got enough market share, people will at least attempt to find vulnerabilities.

227
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,760
I suppose.

228
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,720
I think it's a more enticing market because you have a couple of fundamentals about the

229
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,640
majority of the market, probably not the majority of our audience, but the majority of the market.

230
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,600
They're likely running devices that have built in vulnerabilities at this point that just

231
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,760
haven't been patched for a long time.

232
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,620
And they have an always on data connection.

233
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,820
And that is monetizable by malware in a really special way.

234
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:15,720
Because even just loading ads is so profitable over a large majority of phones.

235
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,560
If you get 100,000, 200,000 phones and you get redirecting ads, and it's only a few pennies,

236
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,240
but it really adds up.

237
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,640
And there's no firewall.

238
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,800
There's no network filter.

239
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,560
There's no network administrator.

240
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,880
There's really no kind of protection that you have in place for a lot of desktop PCs.

241
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,360
I would argue that a desktop PC behind a basic Linksys router is better protected than your

242
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,800
average smartphone that's just raw dog on the cellular network.

243
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,680
Yeah, I hadn't really thought about that.

244
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,280
I suppose a lot of people use Wi-Fi a lot of the time, and therefore they are behind

245
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
a NATed router.

246
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,920
But that's even worse because you're hopping around unknown networks constantly.

247
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,240
You never know who's monitoring.

248
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,920
These are a specific kind of threat vector because they're devices that are unpatched.

249
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,640
You're all over on networks.

250
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,580
You're directly connected to the cellular network, and then the next day you're over

251
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,440
on the Starbucks network with 15 other scoundrels.

252
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,000
But there's just so many more attack vectors on Android than there are on desktop Linux.

253
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
So what's the solution then?

254
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Install antivirus?

255
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,320
Isn't that a horrible thing?

256
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,160
I hate to make this an iOS or Android conversation, but this doesn't seem to be an issue on the

257
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
iOS side.

258
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,280
So perhaps it could just be taken care of at the Play Store level.

259
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,320
Realistically, if you turn off sideloading and you just install apps from the Play Store,

260
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,740
most of the time you're going to be safe.

261
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:35,660
Because countries where they don't have play services or they can't get a play account

262
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,520
for some reason, where they turn on sideloading, it's a problem.

263
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,960
Because geeks who turn on sideloading probably are not the target here.

264
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,880
If you intentionally enable sideloading, you probably know what you're doing.

265
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,200
Probably, I suppose.

266
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,960
But I'm setting up a phone with lineage for someone, and I want to put Addaway on there,

267
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,720
which means I have to enable sideloading.

268
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,760
But it makes me, I don't know, should I do that?

269
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,600
You can even more control in later versions of Android with sideloading.

270
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,840
But I will admit here on the program that I turned on sideloading so I could install

271
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,120
a tricorder app, and I've left it turned on.

272
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,840
But it is the coolest tricorder app ever.

273
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:22,840
So in my defense, you're such a Star Trek nerd.

274
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,960
blast.ting.com Ting is a smarter way to do mobile.

275
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,880
It's just what you use is what you pay.

276
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,880
And that's it.

277
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
No contract.

278
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
No agreements.

279
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,800
They have CDMA and GSM networks, so you can pick whatever works better in your region

280
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,160
or if you have a device that supports one of those networks, which is probably all of

281
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,360
them, just check their BYOD page.

282
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
You can bring it over to Ting.

283
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,520
And if you go to blast.ting.com, you'll get a $25 service credit.

284
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,080
And your average Ting bill is just $23 per phone.

285
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,920
That paid for more than my first month.

286
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,400
blast.ting.com nationwide coverage, pay for what you use, a great dashboard with no contracts.

287
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,560
They have a bunch of great devices you can buy directly.

288
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,000
You hear Joe and I often talk about Lineage or Sailfish.

289
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,920
One of the things I absolutely love about Ting is they have no strategy tax.

290
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,160
You can load whichever OS just functions properly on the network.

291
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,440
They don't have an experience that they want you to have installed on your phone.

292
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:23,400
They just get out of the way and let you use your phone, blast.ting.com Okay, let's talk

293
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:29,300
about Tor and their fundraising campaign, Powering Digital Resistance.

294
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,360
Just a quick plug for them, really.

295
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,360
They're looking for donations and Mozilla is going to match any donations that the public

296
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:40,400
make up to a total of half a million dollars, which is not insignificant.

297
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,320
That means if they get 500,000 from people donating, they'll end up with a million.

298
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,360
Yeah, that means your donation goes twice as far.

299
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,360
So I did it.

300
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,880
I donated and I declined any of the benefits.

301
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,920
They had like stickers and the level I was donating at, you got a shirt, which I honestly

302
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
wouldn't mind.

303
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,760
But I felt like, you know what, keep the money, save even, save, make even more profit off

304
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,760
of my donation.

305
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,760
Yeah.

306
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,960
Tor is not something I use because it's just inconvenient because of all the captures for

307
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,540
every bloody website that you go to.

308
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,640
Anything that's got cloud is just a nightmare.

309
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,720
But I can see that it's very important for some people.

310
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Absolutely the same for me.

311
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,800
I'm not even sure if I've used Tor this year, but I felt like it's a great resource if I

312
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
ever do need it.

313
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,000
And it is a great resource for others.

314
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And while Mozilla is doubling it, why not?

315
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Why not do it?

316
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
So I tossed in.

317
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yeah.

318
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's not like Mozilla can't afford it.

319
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
All right.

320
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,520
Well, that was a quick mention.

321
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
Another quick mention for Solus.

322
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:40,400
iKey put up a post on Google Plus asking for people to contribute artwork to Solus 4, which

323
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,140
is coming, I think before the end of the year, but anyway, coming relatively soon.

324
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,680
And he's basically admitting that he's terrible at art, and that's why there's no install

325
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,320
a slideshow, that sort of thing.

326
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,960
So they're looking for volunteers for this.

327
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,520
And the way I see it is that Solus have done so much great work for the Linux community,

328
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,640
specifically with the Steam stuff.

329
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,460
It just seems fair enough for them to ask for a bit back from the community.

330
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,360
So if you're good at art and want to help them out, it would be great, even if you don't

331
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,200
use Solus, even if it's just to help out the Linux community.

332
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,520
Yeah, and I would say that the Steam stuff is even the least of it.

333
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,640
There is more stuff than people are aware of.

334
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,880
And eventually, I hope the entire Linux community will see the clear Linux bootloader way, and

335
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,520
we'll get new bootloaders for all.

336
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,040
In the meantime, also help them out with a logo.

337
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,480
They should add that to their list.

338
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,240
Well, you don't really care for the Solus logo, then.

339
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,160
It doesn't make me think of Solus at all.

340
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,880
It makes me think actually of software development.

341
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,040
When I see that, it looks like a software development company logo.

342
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
That's all.

343
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,160
I don't think of the Linux desktop at all, or the great desktop that it makes.

344
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,120
But maybe that's because I'm just lost in VR, Joe.

345
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,160
Yeah, maybe.

346
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,200
So this is a bit of a depressing thing, isn't it, that Steam VR market share is already bigger

347
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,400
than Steam Linux market share.

348
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,080
That doesn't look good, does it?

349
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,960
I suppose it doesn't look good, no.

350
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,480
This is a hard thing to measure precisely because overall Steam market share is always

351
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
increasing.

352
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,180
So it doesn't necessarily correlate to less Linux.

353
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:14,840
It just means it's just a smaller percentage of the overall share.

354
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,480
The reality is that VR games are those sort of adopter-driven type games.

355
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,240
You're going to buy the hardware, you're going to load Windows, because that's where the

356
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,700
best VR games are at, and if you're going to invest hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

357
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,840
of dollars into this, you're not going to stop at the OS.

358
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,320
So that doesn't surprise me.

359
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,160
I would be surprised if in a year or so things didn't shake out, though.

360
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,280
What, you think that there'll be more people using Linux or fewer people using VR?

361
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,800
Well, both, actually.

362
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,960
You'll have more people using Linux, you'll have more VR games on Linux, and you're going

363
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,520
to have more adoption of Vulkan, which is going to enable the more VR games.

364
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,240
And I think as that shifts, you'll see this even out a bit.

365
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,320
It's always going to be predominant on Windows for now, but I would suspect that eventually

366
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,340
there's going to be some other VR platform that's going to kick Windows off the charts

367
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,480
that comes out.

368
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,600
And we won't even be having this conversation anymore.

369
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
I don't know, man.

370
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,880
PC gaming and Windows are just so closely tied together.

371
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,480
Unless you've got a completely independent VR headset that doesn't need a Windows PC

372
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,320
or some sort of PC to plug into, but that feels so far away.

373
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,760
Yeah, but I think it'll happen.

374
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,080
That's exactly what I think.

375
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,480
You might be right.

376
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,520
I was just thinking recently, I don't need Linux to have all the games.

377
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,320
I just need to have a few games that I want to play, and it's pretty much there now.

378
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,380
And I think that's going to become more and more commonplace.

379
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,380
We'll see.

380
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,380
Time will tell.

381
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:40,120
Speaking of looking ahead, 2018 is going to be a year of regulation for cryptocurrencies,

382
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,120
in Russia at least.

383
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,320
Yeah, there's been new orders from on high in the Russian government to determine how

384
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:51,080
cryptocurrencies, all of them, but obviously Bitcoin, fit into the broader Russian financial

385
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,320
regulatory framework by next July.

386
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,740
The orders also are going to require legislators to set up a framework for registering miners,

387
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,700
the people that are running the blockchains and the backbones of the currency network,

388
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,560
so that the Russian government can effectively tax them.

389
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:13,160
Now the whole idea here is to set up a regulatory platform known as a sandbox.

390
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,440
Look at them using these modern terms, where blockchain developers can basically demonstrate

391
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,440
new technologies or new applications to the Bank of Russia, so that they can then be regulated

392
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,680
appropriately and legal before the end of the year.

393
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:30,560
I get the feeling all this regulation that we're starting to see now in China, in Russia,

394
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:36,680
even in Europe, and even in the States, is just going to have the complete opposite effect

395
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,880
to what they want.

396
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:44,920
This is the old financial systems trying to regulate this new thing, and you cannot do

397
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
that.

398
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,660
It's just going to drive it, not even underground, but it's just going to drive it further away.

399
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:57,520
It's going to mean that, okay, it might mean that these currencies don't have as high a

400
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,280
dollar value, but does that even really matter if you're actually trading in the currency

401
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,040
itself?

402
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,560
It's going to kind of separate the two systems in my mind.

403
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:13,120
Maybe I'm totally wrong about this, but that's the feeling that I get.

404
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,480
Not now, but long term, this is the effect that it'll have.

405
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,480
I think I disagree.

406
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:24,480
I think it's going to legitimize the currencies, because it adds a tangible aspect to them

407
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,480
that the government is recognizing, quantifying, and taxing them.

408
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,960
It creates a legal framework around the cryptocurrency that takes it out of a gray space and brings

409
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:40,400
it clearly into the financial regulations, which means real speculators, real financial

410
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,360
people can start to treat this as a commodity that they can trade in without legal ambiguity.

411
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,600
It's actually, I think, going to be a huge boost for cryptocurrencies in Russia, because

412
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,000
now it's not a gray market item.

413
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,400
It's legally being recognized.

414
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,240
Well, yeah, but what about people who want it to be gray area or even worse than that?

415
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:05,200
People who want to conduct criminal activity using it, they're still going to use cryptocurrencies

416
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,200
for that, even if it is legitimized.

417
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,200
Maybe it'll be forks.

418
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,100
Maybe it'll be new currencies coming along, but you're not going to get rid of that kind

419
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,800
of activity by regulation, because they don't care about regulation.

420
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,800
100%.

421
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,080
And that's the beauty of it.

422
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:26,240
There will always be a viral aspect to cryptocurrencies that gray and black markets can trade in,

423
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,000
and they'll be able to trade up into Bitcoin, which is going to be the beauty of it for

424
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,520
them.

425
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,760
And so there will be a legitimacy, quote unquote, facade placed on cryptocurrencies.

426
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,900
But the just sort of wild west nature of cryptocurrencies means there's always going to be new ones

427
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,760
created every single day that the speed of government can't keep up with, that the black

428
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,260
market could take advantage of and adapt very quickly to.

429
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,360
And it's just going to be a lot more of what we see today.

430
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,240
In some ways, Russia is ahead of many other countries with this.

431
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,840
Well, that's true, because we're starting to see plans for regulation, whereas Russia

432
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,680
is just going ahead and doing it.

433
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,760
And the sandbox idea is not a bad one.

434
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,800
It's like, here's a safe space where we won't come after you, where you can prove a concept

435
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,180
to us, and we will bless it from beginning to end.

436
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,360
And if you think about that, the market's going to like that, because that's going to

437
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,920
be something safe for businesses to bet on.

438
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:25,160
And so you think that this is going to mean a massive rise in the value of Bitcoin, basically?

439
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,800
I think it's going to be good for Bitcoin.

440
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,120
Yeah, I think we're going to look at the $5,000 plus price today.

441
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,240
And it will be, we'll look back at that, go, yeah, remember when it was below $7,000?

442
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,880
I'm not saying anytime soon, and things can change.

443
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,960
But typically, this stuff ends up in the long run being a boost for Bitcoin.

444
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,800
It has every single time so far.

445
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,320
OK, well, I'm going to ask you to go out on a limb here.

446
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:55,600
Give me the dollar value of Bitcoin one year, five years, and 10 years from now.

447
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,760
Couldn't do it, Jill.

448
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,520
If you had told me today that it was over $5,000 US greenbacks, I would have told you,

449
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
no way.

450
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,840
And so now it seems like $10,000 is the next threshold.

451
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,280
I think all bets are off.

452
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,860
I think it's probably going to get there.

453
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,240
And once it gets there, people are either going to freak out and sell, or it's going

454
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:19,280
to enter the radars of the really big investors, the people who buy really expensive commodities.

455
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

456
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,960
As we record this, it's over $6,000.

457
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,960
$6,143.

458
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,160
Yeah, it has been for a while, I think.

459
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:32,480
I've stopped watching it closely because it just drives me crazy.

460
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,440
It really is something to watch this.

461
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,560
Every time I see this, I think to myself, I should still be doing Plan B, because this

462
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,200
is really something to watch this.

463
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,200
Well, I'm sure this is a topic that we're going to return to on future shows.
