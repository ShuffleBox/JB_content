00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,400
This is episode 16, recorded on August 27th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,400
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,400
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,000
We have a lot to get to today, so let's jump right into it with some new hardware news

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,200
from our friends over at the Ubuntu Budgie project.

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:36,920
Yeah, they've teamed up with Nimbusoft, who are a UK based, well, Clevo reseller, let's

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,200
face it.

10
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,240
But let's move on from that.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:47,240
They're selling laptops and an all in one PC with Ubuntu Budgie preloaded, which is

12
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,240
pretty good news.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,560
I hadn't even heard of Nimbusoft, so good on them for doing this deal and making us

14
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,600
aware of them.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,680
I hadn't heard of them either.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,540
I was wondering, because they're UK based, if perhaps you had.

17
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,960
They also ship Ubuntu Mate systems as well, stock Ubuntu systems.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
You mentioned the Clevo thing.

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,860
I actually want to touch on it just for a second, because I think it does matter in

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,860
this case.

21
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,880
So you have an iMac like system.

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,920
There's also a couple of laptops, a 14.1 inch widescreen laptop, as well as a 17.3 inch

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
laptop.

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,320
A nice thin one though, 25 millimeters is actually pretty amazing for a 17.3.

25
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,000
You mentioned Clevo, and I think it's important simply because what it comes down to with

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,960
these Clevo resellers is the implementation.

27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,840
How they do it, what research they do, the configuration of parts.

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,080
And that's why I'd like to get the audience's feedback on Nimbusoft, if you guys have bought

29
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,440
hardware from them, what your experience was.

30
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,760
What do you think of the lineup though, Joe?

31
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,360
This all in one type machine that looks pretty slick, which is getting more and more popular,

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,840
especially in office places.

33
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,840
And then these two laptops.

34
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,400
Well, the two laptops have kind of got both bases covered.

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:57,600
The huge 17.3 inch desktop replacement, and then the 14.1 inch one that's kind of more

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,700
aimed at portability, but not the ultimate ultrabook portability.

37
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,960
It's kind of still big enough to do your work on, but you can still put it in a bag.

38
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,780
So I think it's a reasonable selection.

39
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:18,200
And one of them, the big one's got the GTX 950M card in it, which is powerful, but it's

40
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,980
not super, super powerful.

41
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,840
It's kind of a good compromise.

42
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,760
So yeah, all in all, I think it's a pretty good selection.

43
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,840
It would be nice if they also had an ultrabook to go along with them.

44
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,220
You mentioned the video cards, the GTX 950M.

45
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:35,860
That's not so bad considering the price, 799 pounds, which is not bad, but none of these

46
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,360
are overwhelmingly compelling to me.

47
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,040
I would be more inclined to get an XPS 15 or an XPS 13.

48
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,960
I do wish them luck, and I think this is great for the Ubuntu Budgie project.

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,840
Okay, well let's move on to another small Linux hardware company, this time Purism.

50
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,120
And this time instead of a laptop, we're talking about a phone, the Librem 5, which is not

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,660
just going to be the same old Android phone with a few modifications.

52
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,840
This is going to be a phone that runs completely Libre software.

53
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,560
Well almost, but we'll get back to that.

54
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,800
But it's going to run proper GNU slash Linux, and it's going to run their own pure OS.

55
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,840
But it's also going to be able to run other GNU slash Linux distributions, the major ones

56
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,320
like Ubuntu and Fedora.

57
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:24,960
Yeah, there's some fire where there has been smoke for quite a while.

58
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,800
And they've launched a fundraiser.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,320
They have quite a big goal of $1.5 million.

60
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,680
They've raised 6.43% as we record right now, about 96,000 US greenbacks.

61
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:44,400
This is also what they say, the world's first IP native mobile handset using end to end

62
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,800
encrypted decentralized communication, which impressively appears to be powered by the

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,520
open source Matrix project.

64
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,120
Which is absolutely brilliant, as long as the people you want to speak to also use Matrix.

65
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,960
This is something I could get behind for just even communicating with team members or family

66
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
members.

67
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,720
Matrix is way more than Slack, so I do it a disservice by even comparing it.

68
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,840
But you get base functionality from there.

69
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,560
But Matrix is like a connection matrix.

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Oh, look at that.

71
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,580
It can connect everything from text to video, audio, files.

72
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,080
It's a protocol too.

73
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,240
And so it's brilliant to build it into a phone.

74
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,740
And I honestly am surprised they're the first to do this.

75
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,280
And it appears to be legitimate cooperation with the Matrix project who seem to be very

76
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,780
excited about the possibilities here.

77
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,280
And for how much I use the phone, this kind of thing would actually be perfect for me.

78
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,700
And the idea that my phone calls would be safe, secure, and powered by this awesome

79
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:54,580
open source project running on a free platform, I'm liking these things about it quite a bit.

80
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,960
I was a bit worried at first.

81
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,780
I thought that was going to be the only way to make phone calls on it.

82
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,920
But it is going to have a standard 3G, 4G, LTE, that kind of thing.

83
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,280
So you can make standard phone calls.

84
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,640
You can use standard data on it.

85
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:12,920
And they're going to separate that system on a chip from the CPU, which seems like a

86
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,360
lofty ambition to me.

87
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,760
But well, what do I know?

88
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:20,380
And if they do that, it means that you can just disable that stuff completely if you

89
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,480
just want to use it as a tablet effectively, a tablet that uses Matrix and Wi-Fi or whatever.

90
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,280
So it is basically what we've been dreaming of.

91
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,800
And also, just casual mention, it's also a convergence device.

92
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Yeah.

93
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,000
Well, in fact, the Matrix folks says, well, you can plug in a keyboard and mouse and screen.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,240
So why not?

95
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,400
It's got Debian on there.

96
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,440
Why not?

97
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:49,120
And in their traditional now purism trademark move, they've included hardware kill switches

98
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,500
for camera, microphone, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and the baseband.

99
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:59,760
That might look kind of tacky depending on how it's implemented, but is really appealing.

100
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,480
Not even from like a worried about being spied on perspective, but just from a battery saving

101
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,480
perspective.

102
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,400
Just switch off the baseband.

103
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,800
Switch off the Bluetooth.

104
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
That's really nice.

105
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,240
Yeah, it sounds like a very hackable little device, but it's funny that they talk about,

106
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,400
well, what happens if we don't make our goal of $1.5 million?

107
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,360
They're very passive aggressive, the way they say, oh, well, there's obviously not a need

108
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,520
for a private phone that respects people's freedoms and stuff like that.

109
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,360
And so they're kind of really banking on making this $1.5 million.

110
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,920
And I don't know, is there that much interest in this?

111
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,200
It's only been a few days and they've already raised nearly $100,000, but I don't know.

112
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,720
It seems like lofty goal to me.

113
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,760
$1.5 seems really lofty, but it also seems like a more legitimate price of what it would

114
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,040
actually cost.

115
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,320
Maybe it seems like it would even cost more than that.

116
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:03,100
And the buy-in levels are rather high too, if you want anything of substance.

117
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,640
So this is the part I'm concerned about.

118
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,680
I'll tell you, Joe, why I would be inclined to back it if I could afford it would be the

119
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,020
same reason I originally backed the Librem.

120
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:21,920
Since backing the Librem, I still believe in a laptop that is custom-built by an OEM

121
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,280
designed for Linux with these kill switches.

122
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:30,200
I think it's just a very nice concept, and I'd love to see a company successful at it.

123
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,020
I have that same desire for a mobile device.

124
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,120
I'd love to have a mobile device that's essentially the PC of phones, that I can load whatever

125
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,240
OS I want, just like I can take my x86 PC and load whatever OS I want.

126
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,840
But nothing checks that box right now for me.

127
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,240
But $600 for a five-inch phone that's got no official specs yet, because they're like,

128
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,480
ah, we'll work out the specs later.

129
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Just give us your money now.

130
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
I don't know.

131
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,800
It's a big risk as a backer.

132
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
It is.

133
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
I'll give them this.

134
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,440
They've made progress since their initial fundraisers.

135
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,280
They've worked on getting their laptops to be as binary blob-free as possible.

136
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,720
They've made a lot of progress on reverse engineering Intel technologies to facilitate

137
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
that.

138
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,640
And if they say that they'll do the same for the baseband stuff, I have a tendency to believe

139
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,600
them, because legitimately, they have assigned dedicated resource to reverse engineering

140
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,280
this stuff for the laptops and made steady progress.

141
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,580
You got to give them credit for that.

142
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,380
And I would like to see that if a company came along and did something like this, that

143
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,760
they'd also be working on that same thing.

144
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,880
And well, Purism seems to have shown they'll be willing to do that if the product is successful.

145
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,960
We'll see, though.

146
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,440
It's a big risk.

147
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,440
I wonder how much of a stake they have in this.

148
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,200
The tone of the fundraiser here leads me to suspect that if this doesn't go well for them,

149
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,320
we could be looking at them having to make some tough decisions post-fundraiser.

150
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,720
That's what I take from the tone of the fundraiser here, which is sort of concerning, because

151
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,400
that means one less company working towards this goal.

152
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Yeah.

153
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,280
Well, I've been very cynical about them in the past, but I do wish them the best.

154
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,640
I hope they make it.

155
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,520
I'm not going to back it, but I really do hope they make it, and I hope that it proves

156
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,680
that there is a need for a proper Linux phone.

157
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,680
But in the meantime, let's talk about another Linux operating system for phones, and that

158
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,160
is Sailfish.

159
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:36,200
So Yola have had all sorts of problems financially, and their latest scheme, shall we say, to

160
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:44,460
make some money, is to port Sailfish to the Xperia X, the Sony phone, and charge people

161
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:48,760
50 euros for the ROM.

162
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,760
Now I don't like to think of them as selling a ROM, I like to think of it more as accepting

163
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,680
donations or forcing people to donate in order to download it.

164
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
What's wrong with that?

165
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
I mean, I think it's great.

166
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,200
I think they should be charging 100 bucks.

167
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,000
The problem is that it's a development ROM, and you can get development ROMs all over

168
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,520
XDA for different operating systems.

169
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,520
Oh, sure.

170
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
Yeah.

171
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,040
See, this to me, though, reads differently.

172
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,980
I'm reading this as we're starting with this as a base, and then we are going to actually

173
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,640
pay people to make it work really good for the Sony Xperia X.

174
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,720
So it's like a first-class OS on the Xperia X, as if Sony shipped it running that.

175
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,800
So if you look at their current state right now, they are lacking major features.

176
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,960
They don't have Bluetooth, they don't support the step counter stuff, the barometer stuff,

177
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,400
the fingerprint or the FM radio.

178
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,320
There's all kinds of little things that are rough around the edges that they're going

179
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,920
to have to sit down and pay somebody to fix for months.

180
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,680
So how do you afford to do that if you don't charge?

181
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,320
Well, I suppose.

182
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,320
I suppose.

183
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,480
But just for me as a consumer, I don't really have any interest in paying money for something

184
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,520
that doesn't work, but I suppose it's not really aimed at consumers.

185
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,520
Yeah.

186
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,520
Plus, you still have to buy the phone.

187
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,120
It doesn't come with a phone, so you have to get that yourself.

188
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
Yeah.

189
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,600
I mean, flashing UBIPorts on an old Nexus is one thing, and checking it out and, oh,

190
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,400
this has got potential and stuff.

191
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,840
And then going back to my OnePlus 3T is one thing, but committing $50 for a ROM is just

192
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,880
not something I could ever see myself doing.

193
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,200
But they need a revenue stream somehow, and this seems like a reasonable-ish way.

194
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,400
I think there are people who will pay it, but it feels very niche to me.

195
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,400
I agree.

196
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,520
But perhaps it'll be a sustainable method to development, and you might see one day

197
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:39,160
that it's just a really great ROM for that Xperia X, and you can buy that phone and just

198
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,480
have a first-class Sailfish experience.

199
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,640
And we'll look back at it and go, that was a great approach.

200
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,980
Or it'll just go nowhere, Joe, because I think you're probably right.

201
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,800
Seems to me it's a niche of a niche of a niche inside a niche.

202
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Yeah.

203
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
All right.

204
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,520
Well, let's talk about the first-class experience you've had with your Nexus 6P over the last

205
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
few days.

206
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Yeah.

207
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,080
I took the plunge for the show, of course, and upgraded the Nexus 6P to Android 8.0,

208
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,480
which launched on August 21st.

209
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,640
It's Google's Oreo release.

210
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,280
And there's big changes to notifications, which are the thing I'm most excited about.

211
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,280
I don't really know how it's going to play out yet because no applications support these

212
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
new things.

213
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:26,760
But the big one that matters to me is notification channels and notification grouping of the

214
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,580
visual alerts.

215
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,060
Those are going to be great features for those of us that are a little sensitive to interruptions

216
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,480
by notifications.

217
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,020
But there's other nice things in here too, Joe, but nothing that really jumped out at

218
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,760
me immediately as an end user.

219
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,760
Yeah.

220
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,220
It all seems to be sort of behind-the-scenes stuff, doesn't it?

221
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,360
Just making things a little bit better, optimizations.

222
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,280
The autofill API is pretty cool so that password managers will be able to speak directly to

223
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,080
applications, and that should make security a little bit better.

224
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,280
That'll remove a bit of a barrier for some people.

225
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Yeah.

226
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,040
Now it'll be easier to use really complicated passwords and password managers when you're

227
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,280
logging into your apps and websites.

228
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,600
That's going to be super nice if apps update to trigger that.

229
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Yeah.

230
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,480
I don't know about fingerprint gestures.

231
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,700
Now I've finally got a fingerprint reader.

232
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:20,760
It doesn't work all that well, for me at least, so I'm wondering if fingerprint gestures are

233
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,120
even going to be a practical thing, and I just can't really envisage how they're going

234
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
to work.

235
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
But clearly some developers have got ideas about that.

236
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,720
I have a suspicion that a week or two into using Android 8, I'll have a better idea if

237
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,840
their new background limits work.

238
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,880
These are more like an iPhone, the way it works with limiting background things.

239
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,560
It limits what apps can do in the background in broadcasting on any of your antennas, on

240
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,400
the services they can pull on, on how often they can grab location, and these things,

241
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,640
just tampering down on that a bit, could actually make some pretty significant overall improvements

242
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,640
in battery life.

243
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,380
So I'll probably give you an update on that at some point.

244
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,680
If I ever get it on a tablet, I'd probably enjoy the new picture-in-picture mode.

245
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,440
They say it works on phones too, but that sounds kind of nice.

246
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,040
So if you're on Telegram and watching YouTube video, you could pop out the YouTube video

247
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,580
and then go back into Telegram chat and keep watching the video, so that all sounds kind

248
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,580
of nice.

249
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,000
As for the background limiting, I do worry a little bit about that, because on the one

250
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,960
hand, yeah, it's great for battery optimization, there's no doubt about that, but isn't one

251
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,720
of the great things about Android the proper multitasking that it can do?

252
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,880
You can leave things running in the background that you want to be running, so I think they've

253
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,280
got to get the granularity of that right, so that some apps that you genuinely want

254
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,440
to be running in the background can still do that.

255
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,480
Otherwise you end up with the iPhone, which is, is it fair to say pseudo-multitasking?

256
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,320
Yeah, it's, you have certain privileged APIs that can run in the background, and outside

257
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,480
of that your application gets suspended.

258
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,080
It does make for better battery life, but you're right, it is one of the things I like

259
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,560
about Android, as long as you manage it properly.

260
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,040
I don't think most end users do, but I think most geeks and tech users probably manage

261
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,280
that pretty good.

262
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,400
Well, maybe I'll get to try it one day, once Lineage gets the code, which it has been open

263
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,520
source now, so I'm sure there'll be a Lineage ROM coming soon, and as soon as I get that

264
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,680
I'll check it out on one of my Nexus devices.

265
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,160
I'd be tempted to try that myself, that might be when I switch over to Lineage.

266
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,320
I'll say this, the first about hour that I had Android O on my Nexus 6P, it was very

267
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
sluggish.

268
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,680
I think it must have been running in some background processes, but then after that

269
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,000
the performance has been pretty great, and overall, one of my smoother Android updates.

270
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,080
It's pretty minimal update in terms of what you see, things just look a little more refined,

271
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:43,080
and the performance seems to be about the same after the first hour or two of the update.

272
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,560
last.ting.com, l-e-s.ting.com.

273
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,920
Go there to support this show, keep us going, and get $25 in Ting service credits or $25

274
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,360
off a device over at Ting.

275
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,420
Ting is mobile done right.

276
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,400
The average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month.

277
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,640
It's $6 for your baseline, and then your usage on top of that.

278
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,600
You just pay for what you use, there's no crazy agreements or contracts or early termination

279
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
fees.

280
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,240
They have nationwide coverage, GSM and CDMA to choose from.

281
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
You just pay for what you use.

282
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,440
You want a couple of phones, $6 a line, plus whatever Uncle Sam's cut is in your local

283
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
neck of the woods.

284
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,400
The thing that Ting is really focused on is an incredible user experience.

285
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:29,280
A great control panel, fantastic customer service, and a blog that's constantly updated

286
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,920
with useful information.

287
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,720
They got the full spectrum of devices from really nice value devices all the way up to

288
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,040
the brand new greatest iPhones and Galaxy devices.

289
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,980
Also, just grab a Nexus device and bring it over to Ting.

290
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:47,000
They're great, and they have CDMA and GSM support so you can pick whatever works best

291
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,480
in your area.

292
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,480
last.ting.com.

293
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:58,640
Okay, let's talk about Chrome OS and their new Enterprise Edition.

294
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:02,440
Not content with dominating the education market, at least in the US.

295
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,760
Google have decided they're going to have a go at Enterprise now.

296
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,120
It kind of makes sense because the Enterprise doesn't really want to move beyond Windows

297
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:16,600
7 because 8, disaster, 10, don't really like that very much.

298
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,960
They're going to have this version that has active directory support and is only going

299
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:29,080
to be $50 per year per device, which compared to Windows license is not very much.

300
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,920
They're really going after Microsoft here.

301
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,960
They're going after Microsoft's bread and butter because this also comes with Google

302
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,560
Apps, which is a direct competitor to Microsoft Office.

303
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:43,680
The offline Enterprise features like active directory integration means we'll support

304
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,880
your existing authorization infrastructure.

305
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,520
This was a classic Microsoft move.

306
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,440
They did this to NetWare.

307
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,200
Microsoft came in early to try to get Windows Server to take off and they said, we'll support

308
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,400
your NetWare infrastructure.

309
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,720
And then eventually everybody moved off of NetWare.

310
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,680
This is a brilliant strategy by Google.

311
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,880
If I was Microsoft, I'd be very worried here.

312
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
It's getting a bit crowded.

313
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,960
Of course, Microsoft's focused on perhaps greener pastures.

314
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,320
Microsoft and Red Hat have just announced plans to expand an alliance that they've had

315
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,200
in place for a few years now.

316
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,720
There will be now native support made available for Windows Server containers on Red Hat's

317
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,040
OpenShift platform, which is their Kubernetes-based container application platform.

318
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:33,280
Red Hat's OpenShift Dedicated, is what it's called, will be offered also on Azure.

319
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,280
Kubernetes.

320
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,280
I've always said Kubernetes.

321
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,280
I don't know.

322
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
I've never...

323
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
I think Kubernetes might be right.

324
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,440
Kubernetes is just an old habit of mine.

325
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,720
I'm horrible with those kinds of things.

326
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,200
Don't follow my pronunciation.

327
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,360
Get external verification.

328
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,160
With this cozying up, it looks good from a corporate point of view, but it doesn't look

329
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,880
good community-wise, does it?

330
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,820
Is that really a thing anymore?

331
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:58,200
Because this is really about running Windows on GNU slash Linux, isn't it?

332
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,120
In fact, the third aspect of this, which is really big to my old school IT ears, is they're

333
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:10,320
also greatly expanding the relationship, quote unquote, of the availability of SQL Server

334
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,920
on Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

335
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Well, yeah.

336
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,680
That means that you can either run Red Hat on Windows or Windows on Red Hat and SQL Server

337
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,680
on either.

338
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
Yeah.

339
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:27,880
It's like a bigger, higher-stakes version of the old deal that they established with

340
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,740
Novell back in the day to run SUSE Linux on Windows virtual servers.

341
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:36,960
This is Windows servers for the most part, Windows containers actually, running on Red

342
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,360
Hat's OpenShift platform, which is eating a lot of Microsoft's lunch too these days.

343
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,600
Well, I suppose if you can't beat them, join them, right?

344
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Yeah, absolutely.

345
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,320
And it's still a win for Microsoft at the end of the day.

346
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,600
If you're spinning up a Red Hat instance on Azure, that's revenue for Microsoft.

347
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Yeah.

348
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,080
But you've downplayed the community thing, but to me, I seriously think that it just

349
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,280
makes people wary of Red Hat and therefore, by extension, Fedora.

350
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,960
It just makes me think, it just makes me feel a bit dirty.

351
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,000
If I was a Fedora user, I'd just be like, I don't really like that Red Hat are cozying

352
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,040
up so much with Microsoft.

353
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,400
What about Ubuntu in the Windows store or SUSE in the Windows store, does that bother

354
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
you?

355
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,880
A bit, if I'm honest, yeah.

356
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,040
I feel like it's just a sign of the times.

357
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
Things have changed.

358
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,040
Yeah, definitely.

359
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,480
You just have to accept it, but it doesn't make me feel any happier about it.

360
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,800
Maybe I'm being a proper neckbeard here, but it's just, to me, Red Hat, they've always

361
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:36,480
been the corporate side of Linux, but this to me, it really rams that point home and

362
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,160
how they really, I keep using the word cozying up, but that's all I can think of because

363
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,000
they're just being so corporate about it and just not caring really about anything but

364
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,200
the bottom line here.

365
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,000
They're not really caring about freedom and all the storm and stuff, and I suppose they

366
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
never have.

367
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,560
They've always pushed open source and never once talked about free software, but it doesn't

368
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,720
sit right with me.

369
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,640
Yeah, fair enough.

370
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,960
I suppose there's probably a lot of people that feel the way you do.

371
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,600
Medusa, they're unperturbed by the expansion of the Red Hat Microsoft deal.

372
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,880
Well, so they say.

373
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,400
Yeah, of course.

374
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,360
It's funny that they even make a statement about it.

375
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:22,360
They were asked to comment though by IT Wire, and I don't know, it's sort of cagey.

376
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,440
I guess the question was posed to them, what do you think about Microsoft and Red Hat quote

377
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,720
unquote cozying up and Red Hat becoming the preferred provider for Linux, and their response

378
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,040
was I don't see where it says Red Hat is preferred.

379
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,920
Perhaps I'm missing something.

380
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,600
They're very direct, aren't they?

381
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,180
Very unambiguous, if it doesn't say that.

382
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:46,200
They also tweeted out after that, what's your toolkit for containers?

383
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,800
We've expanded our offering staying true to hashtag open source.

384
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,920
Yeah, and they talk about being an open source company and all the rest of it.

385
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,200
To me, trying to appeal to the community, sending Richard over to WorldCamp to tell

386
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,280
us all about how everything's open source and really community driven and all the rest

387
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
of it.

388
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,840
That's the image they're trying to go for, aren't they?

389
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,640
They want to make money, but they don't want to be seen to be really corporate at the same

390
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
time.

391
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,360
And it's a good distraction from the fact that you totally fumbled the container craze

392
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,000
and nobody's using SUSE to run all these container platforms.

393
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But they're working on it now, Chris.

394
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's the main thing.

395
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,280
Yeah, and I shouldn't say nobody, but it's essentially in terms of market, nobody.

396
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,280
Yeah.

397
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,840
But either way, they're still going to use BtreeFS or ButterFS, aren't they?

398
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,960
Yeah, so people have been wondering what's going to happen now that more distributions

399
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,640
are either launching with ZFS support or turning away from ButterFS support like Red Hat, who

400
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,680
was a while ago a rather large contributor, and is now saying we're going to focus on

401
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,680
other things like Project Stratus.

402
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:49,360
SUSE has made a post on the SUSE blog over at suse.com, and they say that they're committed

403
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,040
to ButterFS as the default file system for SUSE, Linux, Enterprise, and beyond.

404
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,640
Well, they're nothing if stubborn, is that a word for it?

405
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,600
They've decided to use ButterFS and they're sticking to it.

406
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
What can you say, fair play?

407
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,840
I am glad somebody is going to continue to support it and invest in it, because it does

408
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,400
have potential and maybe one day could really be something great for everyone.

409
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,980
There's a little insight into the thinking that they have on their blog in this post.

410
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,840
They brag about being the number one upstream contributor now to ButterFS.

411
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,500
That's sort of like that socially awkward guy who's the last one at a party bragging

412
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,080
about how he's the only one still partying.

413
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,120
Everyone's left.

414
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,360
We're all moved on to other things, and now, sort of by process of elimination, they're

415
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,800
the number one upstream contributor.

416
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,480
As they've scaled up their investment and other people have left, like Red Hat, and

417
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,840
Oracle has dialed way back, and Facebook is dialing back, you have essentially independent

418
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
contributors left.

419
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,000
You have Fujitsu, you have SUSE.

420
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,120
In that list, SUSE is obviously the number one contributor, but yet they still make a

421
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,400
point to brag about it in the post.

422
00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:00,660
It's funny that they address the issues with ButterFS and say that they still haven't implemented

423
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:06,080
the automatic defragmentation, the in-band deduplication, and the higher RAID levels,

424
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,560
and they say because the quality of these options is not where it ought to be, which

425
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,260
again is kind of fair enough, really.

426
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:17,360
That's them saying, look, the main bit of ButterFS is fine and enterprise-ready, but

427
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,440
there's certain features which we don't think are, and so we're just refusing to support

428
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
them.

429
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,680
Yeah, completely reasonable and a safe way to do it.

430
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,800
That is good.

431
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,440
The sentence before that, though, indicates where the cracks are in the surface, because

432
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:36,000
the sentence before that is, and against the demand of some of our partners, we're still

433
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,760
refusing to support these things.

434
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,160
So their partners, which might be a way of saying customers or people that want to base

435
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,440
off of SUSE, want these features.

436
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,280
They need these features in production.

437
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,680
They're coming to SUSE and saying ButterFS isn't sufficient for us, so they write this

438
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,920
in as demand, as if they're silly.

439
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,200
As if their silly business use cases don't really matter, and if they would just calm

440
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,280
down and just use the safe ButterFS implementation that the overlords at SUSE have implemented,

441
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,120
everything would be fine.

442
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:13,240
That's sort of a weird way of thinking about it, but it's a harsh way for me to look at

443
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:19,480
this, I suppose, because if I zoom out from this blog post and some of the way it's written,

444
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:27,600
I am overall really glad that a large contributor to open source like SUSE is taking ButterFS

445
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
under their wing.

446
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,920
They're really kind of owning it here with this blog post, and I'm glad someone is owning

447
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:37,520
it and someone's saying we're going to stay committed, we're going to keep making it better.

448
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,960
That's a good thing for open source.

449
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,320
Man, I just can't help but think back to being in college listening to the Linux Action Show

450
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,160
and you guys talking about how great this new thing was going to be, and here we are

451
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,360
all these years later and you've got one distro using it.

452
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:54,360
Yeah, yeah, it really is something.

453
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,360
And there's some hardware out there using it too, but maybe future developments will

454
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,120
be pretty great and adoption will take off again.

455
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,400
There's one way you can find out.

456
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,580
