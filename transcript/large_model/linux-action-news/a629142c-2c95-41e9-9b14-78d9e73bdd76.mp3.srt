00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,520
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 120, recorded on August 25th, 2019.

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,520
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,520
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,520
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,600
Good to be connected with you, and a big happy birthday to Linux.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,740
Today, on the day as we record, Linus announced Linux on the mailing list 28 years ago.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,120
The comp.os.minix mailing list.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,720
Yeah, it's not quite 30, but it's getting there, eh?

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,920
Any excuse to celebrate, Joe?

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,980
I can't imagine when 30 lands, it's going to be an internet party.

11
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,400
But we start the news out this week from System76, who has announced a new firmware updater.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,620
Yeah, they're calling this Firmware Manager.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:47,640
And it's really a front end for their System76-Firmware command line tool at the moment.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,320
But it is also going to work with FWAPD, or whatever you call it.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,240
We need a standard name for the firmware update tool.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,020
Yeah, we really do.

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,080
So obviously, Gnome Software and Discover already do this.

18
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,680
And this is a tool that's really being built for Pop!

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,120
OS and for Debian distributions right now.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,360
Could be others in the future, if somebody wants to repackage it.

21
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,040
So this is like somebody like yourself, really, Joe, who's on Ubuntu and XFCE, or like myself,

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,040
who's on Ubuntu and XFCE.

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,440
And I don't use Gnome Software very regularly.

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,520
In fact, I just recently spent a weekend on Wayland and Gnome Shell, and I opened up Gnome

25
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,520
Software.

26
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,360
And they had three firmware updates that I just kind of forgotten about, because nothing

27
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,000
really surfaced them for me.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,040
And like you, if I do want a GUI, I'm going to launch Synaptic.

29
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,680
I'm not launching Gnome Software on XFCE.

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,080
So I might actually use this.

31
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
Yeah, same.

32
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,400
It's something that I will certainly look into using, because I haven't updated the

33
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,500
firmware on any of my machines for, well, since I got them, pretty much, because I don't

34
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,400
use Gnome Software.

35
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,680
So yeah, I'm looking forward to it appearing in the repos, possibly as a snap package.

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,960
Love to see.

37
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,280
Obviously, this is for Pop OS users primarily.

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,560
But I did have a chat with System76's CEO, Carl, about this.

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,600
And I asked him, are you turning into a software shop?

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,800
And the answer is sort of.

41
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,160
They're building for Pop OS customers first, but they intend to architect things in a way

42
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,360
that make it usable by pretty much anyone in open source.

43
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,440
They're not trying to limit anybody's use of this.

44
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,240
It's built in Rust.

45
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,800
Both the System76 components that are just for their firmware and the LVFS components

46
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
are modules.

47
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,040
You could build it on a system and have no System76 firmware support at all if you wanted

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,520
to, or vice versa.

49
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,200
And they've done it in a way where you could even write a Qt front end for this thing and

50
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,200
submit it upstream to the project and have a Qt version that's not GTK based.

51
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,560
I like what they're doing here, because they're solving needs for their situation, but they're

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,920
doing it in a way that's above and beyond expectations.

53
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:55,760
Yeah, and it's no secret that the hardware OEMs that System76 use are used by other Linux

54
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,800
computer vendors.

55
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,960
So we could potentially see some benefit for those customers as well.

56
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,720
Now from a user standpoint, what they've really created here is essentially a GTK widget library

57
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,240
that pops into GNOME settings.

58
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,080
So on Pop OS or a different distribution and even theoretically XFCE desktop in the control

59
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,120
panel system settings area, you could have a GTK widget library that pops it open and

60
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,920
there's the firmware manager, no dependencies on any other software orchestration.

61
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
That's really nice.

62
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,280
And I really like the open nature of this.

63
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,320
They're putting up on GitHub, they're blogging about the process, and they're openly supporting

64
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
other front ends.

65
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,360
They've built this in a way where it can be GUI agnostic.

66
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,880
The core library doesn't depend on GTK.

67
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,700
That's super appealing because it could be used wider in the open source ecosystem because

68
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,700
of that.

69
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,960
Like those small decisions they've made that really all kind of aggregate into something

70
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,440
that's very usable by the rest of the community.

71
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,560
Again, I'm really impressed.

72
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,400
I was skeptical and vocal about that skepticism when System76 didn't just go all in with LVFS

73
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,280
like we've seen Lenovo and Dell do recently.

74
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,200
But this seems to be a pretty proper response to the sticky situation they find themselves

75
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,120
in and helps everybody out.

76
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,920
Well, it's much like with Pop OS, we were quite skeptical when that came out and thought,

77
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,560
well, why don't you just use Ubuntu?

78
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,520
And they've kind of proved us wrong to an extent in that they have added value to Ubuntu

79
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,080
and differentiated themselves there.

80
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,440
And so sometimes it is worth letting things shake out and seeing what people's long-term

81
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,540
plan is, companies' long-term plan, because sometimes what might seem immediately obvious

82
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,840
isn't necessarily obvious when you come a few months or years down the line.

83
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,120
And the other lesson here is a lot of open source stuff is done out in the open.

84
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,540
It's put out there early so that way it can evolve and mature.

85
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,120
And that is often a time where things are not fully formed.

86
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,400
They're not done yet.

87
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,560
I'm also coming around to Pop OS.

88
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,460
It seems to have caught the attention of popular YouTubers like Linus Tech Tips.

89
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:07,420
Clearly seems to be driving value that users are finding attractive.

90
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,560
And I think there's probably still more they could do to make it an even more valuable

91
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
differentiation.

92
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,720
I don't think it's quite there yet, but it's clear they're going in a direction that is

93
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,840
obvious now.

94
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,840
And that's nice to see.

95
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,600
I think there's lessons to take from this.

96
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,440
And I hope to see some adoption for this tool to benefit all kinds of other desktops and,

97
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,840
most importantly, other distributions too.

98
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,640
Well, I've seen quite a lot of skepticism this week about our next story, and that is

99
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,360
the OpenPower Foundation aligning with the Linux Foundation and releasing the instruction

100
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,840
set architecture for OpenPower.

101
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,720
Yeah, this is a lot.

102
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,760
And this is a big response to the progress we're seeing on RISC-V and the pressure from

103
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,200
ARM processors.

104
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:56,120
So to be clear, BigBlue is moving the OpenPower Foundation, which it formed with Google, Mellanox,

105
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,460
Technologies, NVIDIA, and others.

106
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,740
This is an established pretty big group.

107
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:08,040
And they're moving that under administrative control of the Linux Foundation, which is

108
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,040
a pretty big feather in the Linux Foundation's cap.

109
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:15,680
And they've got so many foundations now, it's feeling more like the Foundation Foundation,

110
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
not so much like the Linux.

111
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Foundations for days.

112
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
Yeah.

113
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
Yeah.

114
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,520
But to your comment, Joe, about skepticism, you're right.

115
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,480
The top comment on LWN is yawn.

116
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,640
Hacker News is like, top comment's 10 years too late.

117
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,320
And people are losing the perspective on this story, sort of like we lost a little perspective

118
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,320
on the Pop!

119
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,320
OS story early on.

120
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,800
And the lessons that we just talked about for that apply to this story as well.

121
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:48,640
This process is something that really began back in 1991.

122
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,720
That's how big picture this is.

123
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:58,340
They're moving pieces that have been shuffled around since Macintosh has had Motorola processors

124
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,340
in them.

125
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,400
So it's a continuous evolution of that effort.

126
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,000
And it had some rough years.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,240
And now, with workloads like AI and RISC-V coming in with an open architecture that's

128
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,920
being really kind of rapidly adopted in the marketplace, I think, in my opinion, that

129
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,920
Open Power Foundation was looking at all of these trends and going, we're missing out.

130
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,200
We got to do something.

131
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,720
So hang on, are you telling me this story's been developing since before some of our listeners

132
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
were even born?

133
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Yeah.

134
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,440
That's the really kind of crazy thing about this.

135
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,560
And that's why it seems like, oh, it's too late.

136
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,960
It's just beginning, my friends.

137
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,960
It really is.

138
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,320
Because what they're doing here is they're essentially just really liberally licensing

139
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,520
their open power platform.

140
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,480
It's not full open source, giving away all the things.

141
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,680
But it is, once you make a deal with them, once you call up the IBM suits and make a

142
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,880
deal, you get everything you essentially need, including some extra bits that aren't part

143
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,220
of the core PowerPC architecture.

144
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,160
It feels like a response to RISC-V, really.

145
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,600
But it's been done in a different way.

146
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,700
I could not really work out exactly what they've opened up here.

147
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:16,240
Because they have opened up the ISA, but it's not completely clear to me exactly how they're

148
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,400
licensing that and to what extent you need to be a member of this foundation.

149
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,920
And so there's a bit of a difference there with RISC-V. It's very clear.

150
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,240
It's completely open under a permissive license.

151
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,080
You can take it and make it proprietary.

152
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,840
Whereas with open power, there seems to be a little bit of confusion there.

153
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,320
We did research into this, and it's just not yet defined.

154
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,840
In fact, also something else that's pretty critical is their memory interface hasn't

155
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,320
been fully explained how that's going to be licensed yet either.

156
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,840
It's just, quote, coming out sometime this year, end quote.

157
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,460
Well, that didn't tell us anything.

158
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,800
So there's more to happen here.

159
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,520
And it really is night and day difference.

160
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:03,120
The RISC-V platform is much more traditionally open source, and this is just liberally licensed.

161
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,600
But I would say IBM's counterargument from the reading I've done is simply the ecosystem.

162
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,920
Yeah, sure, RISC-V might be a more traditional open source model, but we're liberally licensing

163
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,000
the Power9 platform, the PowerPC platform.

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,480
This open power platform has an ecosystem with these open power processors in workstations.

165
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:29,480
And Power9 processors fill the racks of the world's fastest supercomputers.

166
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,560
That's an obvious ecosystem that has robust software written for it, Joe.

167
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:42,300
And that would be their counterargument to that new, immature, risky five platform.

168
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,480
But it does feel like an old world company's approach to things.

169
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,880
If you contrast it with RISC-V and how that feels more agile somehow, this, it does feel

170
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,920
like it's a kind of lumbering piece of an old company trying to stay down with the kids

171
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
somehow.

172
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,960
Yeah, when it comes to that licensing model, they've tried to bolt on a modern governance

173
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,900
model though, which is kind of interesting.

174
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,020
It's part that the Linux Foundation will be managing.

175
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:19,400
This open governance model will have IBM on that board with other foundation members,

176
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:24,160
and IBM gets precisely one vote, same as all of the other foundation members, as to what

177
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,040
changes could be made to the Power ISA in the future.

178
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,240
Now, IBM could, in theory, still make their own changes and ship it, but anything that's

179
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,520
going to become the new standard has to be voted on by all members.

180
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:41,640
So they're bolting on this weird, kind of more modern open governance model.

181
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:46,060
I mean, it's weird in the sense that it's not normally paired with a licensing model

182
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,480
like this that's not fully clear.

183
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,680
But it's more modern than old business, but it still does definitely have that smell.

184
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,880
Yeah, and I think that a lot of people, including me, jump straight for this RISC-V comparison.

185
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,820
I think that potentially we're looking at very different markets here.

186
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,880
That's I think the real truth of it.

187
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,260
Pretty much so.

188
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,360
I think whereas RISC-V is obviously more targeted at the embedded, which PowerPC does have some

189
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,200
plays there, this is more high end.

190
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:22,740
A big focus is extremely high bandwidth interconnections, reducing just the complication in communicating

191
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,400
with the devices so that can be even faster.

192
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,360
Coming up with maybe a replacement to PCI.

193
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,200
All those kinds of things are in the scope of this foundation and all focused on absolute

194
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
performance.

195
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,480
But I just think RISC-V is more focused at the embedded market.

196
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,880
You're not seeing RISC-V in a supercomputer anytime soon.

197
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,800
Well, not just yet, but maybe one day.

198
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Wouldn't that be something?

199
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,040
Could you imagine we're doing Linux Action News 800 and we're talking about how all of

200
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,280
the top supercomputers are RISC based and then you'd like have a whole I told you so moment

201
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,280
here on the show.

202
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,920
Well, it's not the only thing the Linux Foundation have been up to this week.

203
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,360
It's the summer of foundations, Joe.

204
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,360
This is it.

205
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,840
The Linux Foundation has really grown this year.

206
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,320
And now they've launched the Confidential Computing Consortium, which is part of the

207
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Linux Foundation.

208
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,900
Yeah, and they're pitching this as a community focused on projects, securing data in use.

209
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,240
And they talk about in the announcement how at the moment, we've pretty much got data

210
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,560
that is at rest in storage and the encryption of that all sorted out and you know, the security

211
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,700
of that and data in transit over the network, that's pretty much sorted.

212
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:41,120
But data that is in use, that's in memory and in the processor, that is something that

213
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,560
we haven't quite nailed.

214
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,120
And that's what this consortium is supposed to be about, right?

215
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:53,160
Or even database tables, ultimately, they're like measure of success would be if two third

216
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,940
party businesses that do not trust each other, were able to exchange information and have

217
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,120
high confidence in the validity of that information, as so much so that they could conduct a business

218
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,560
transaction or some other transaction of trust.

219
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,720
That would be their benchmark here.

220
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,240
And that is a good goal.

221
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,620
They say current approaches really just don't solve that particular problem.

222
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:21,080
You can tell it's a different time of year though, Joe, because if we were covering this

223
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,080
story at this exact time last year, I feel like every five paragraphs would have the

224
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,960
word blockchain in it.

225
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,560
Yeah, or there'd be more about Spectre and Meltdown because that was the first thing

226
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,600
I thought about was the whole attack factor there is data that's in use and in memory

227
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,240
and in the CPU.

228
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,160
And so this feels like a potentially quite late backlash to that.

229
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,520
You could be right, Joe, because if you look at who's involved at this, it's like all the

230
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:56,560
big names in the Linux Foundation, Alibaba Cloud, the ARM consortium, Google, IBM, Microsoft,

231
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,880
Swiss Telecom, Intel.

232
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,360
It's like the Linux Foundation was sitting around, you know, they're all having cocktails

233
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,260
and they're saying, what could we do here that all of these different companies bring

234
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,260
to the table?

235
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,260
What could we pull together?

236
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:14,280
So like, well, let's go get that trusted hardware platform research that Microsoft did and let's

237
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,000
go get Intel Secure Enclave information and we'll pull that in.

238
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,720
And let's go talk to IBM about that work they're doing on that encryption system and we'll

239
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
bring that.

240
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,840
They went to all of their big players and said, we're holding a security buffet.

241
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
What can you bring to the party?

242
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,840
And then they're putting it all under this label, this like one brand.

243
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,240
It's very businessy, Joe, but at the same time, like, what's it going to take to get

244
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,280
our data secured?

245
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
What's it going to take, Joe?

246
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,080
Yeah, when money's involved, people suddenly start taking an interest.

247
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,240
And something that people should probably take more of an interest in is supply chain

248
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
attacks.

249
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,360
I never really considered these supply chain attacks, but when you consider that malware

250
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,680
authors and attackers are going after the source of open source applications that users

251
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,660
get it from, all right, it makes sense.

252
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,760
The article here from Dan Gooden over at Ars Technica, we'll have a link in the show notes,

253
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,980
and he makes a pretty good argument, essentially running down a history of the most recent

254
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:15,960
dozen attacks, starting off with probably the most well known one currently, which is

255
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,240
the backdoor that was in Webman that's recently come to light.

256
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,880
And then he quickly points out that there was a backdoor that came to light on Monday.

257
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:30,080
11 libraries in the Ruby Gems repository had some form of malware backdoor.

258
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,240
And he's really making the case through this entire article.

259
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,500
And I'm forced to agree that malware authors and attackers have figured out go after the

260
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,600
source that users already trust, like the Ruby Gems repositories, or Webman from the

261
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,640
project site directly from their site.

262
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,640
People think that's safe.

263
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:51,720
You know, I went to the Webman project, and I downloaded it directly from their website.

264
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,320
I didn't get it off some mirror.

265
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
I got it from the source.

266
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,160
Yeah, and he does point out that this isn't unique to open source software, but in a way

267
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,480
is kind of more prevalent there.

268
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,640
And this really comes back to an issue that we're seeing time and time again with open

269
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,320
source projects not necessarily being good at the other stuff.

270
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,760
They make great software, but they're not necessarily the greatest sysadmins.

271
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:19,960
They don't necessarily have all the best practices in place to stop this kind of thing happening.

272
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Right.

273
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
And there's also the monetary aspect.

274
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,360
A lot of times there isn't the money to pay somebody to maintain all of this.

275
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,360
I guess I hope down the road, computers can solve this problem a little bit.

276
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,040
It feels like computers can get better at recognizing these types of attacks, screening

277
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,440
these vulnerabilities out of repositories.

278
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,960
There's more and more systems we're seeing now around scanning repositories for vulnerabilities

279
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,760
or having trusted publishers like the Snap Store does.

280
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,960
And it seems like we'll settle on solutions, but it's this long meandering process to get

281
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
there.

282
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,940
Well, I was going to bring up Snap and Flatpak and that perhaps moving to these more modern

283
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:02,720
ways of distributing software, we can hopefully build in some protections against this.

284
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,200
Our user base has a really good shot at this because we are a little more aware of these

285
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:12,560
issues than say your average Windows user might be or even your average Android user

286
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,440
who goes into the store and just gets the freebie phone.

287
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,900
They're not thinking about isolation.

288
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,320
They're not thinking about the source of the software.

289
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,280
So we have a leg up there that it's even something we're even aware of.

290
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,480
Now what we do with that knowledge, that remains to be seen.

291
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,660
I do think that the conversation around Snaps and Flatpaks has been productive in the sense

292
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:38,720
that it's gotten the conversation in the user base going about isolated applications, about

293
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,380
giving applications implicit access to certain things like webcam, your file system, hardware.

294
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,080
That kind of thing isn't something that we even discussed three or four or five years

295
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,440
ago before we started talking about this stuff.

296
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,940
And it's raised the level of awareness in the user base.

297
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,200
Now just about every Linux user that's been following this stuff for a while is aware

298
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,080
that there's inherent security issues in X11 and that there's things that applications

299
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,640
can do that they shouldn't be able to do.

300
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,060
Those conversations are healthy.

301
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,160
That awareness is healthy.

302
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
Oh yeah, definitely.

303
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,380
And recently my eyes have been opened to this because I've been trying to convert a Windows

304
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:24,560
user who is somewhat obsessed with privacy and uses Signal and he's into VPNs and all

305
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,560
that.

306
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:30,180
I've tried to convert him to Linux and it's kind of getting there slowly but surely.

307
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:36,560
And he raised the point with me that Linux isn't necessarily any more private than Windows

308
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,240
because of things like applications not being isolated from each other and being able to

309
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,040
send data around.

310
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,840
And so from that complete outsider's point of view, I feel like he does actually have

311
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,840
a point there.

312
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Yeah, I can understand that.

313
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,560
My response would be the great thing about Linux is you can take it as far as you want.

314
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,360
You could go to the cubes OS extreme, like you guys tried on Choose Linux recently, you

315
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,280
go that far, or you could install a flat pack or a snap version of an application that is

316
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,560
just slightly isolated or is completely isolated.

317
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,120
You can dial that up and down, you can have a read only file system, all of that stuff.

318
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,720
You just kind of just have to know how to do it.

319
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
That's the barrier.

320
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:19,320
And that's why surfacing this stuff to the users by default in a way that doesn't hamper

321
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,960
power users I think is really important.

322
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,840
Because I don't think we want to lose sight of the fact that Linux is used primarily by

323
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:32,760
power users, developers, system administrators, tinkerers, enthusiasts, those of us who like

324
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,800
to play and mess around with our computers.

325
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,760
That's a lot of the core Linux user base.

326
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,000
And so if you make an operating system that doesn't serve them, you're going to have a

327
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,960
bunch of people that are forking projects and complaining all the time.

328
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,480
But you have to balance that with presenting same defaults that provide protection and

329
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,480
isolation.

330
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,120
And I would, I'd be willing to wager in three to four years, most distributions are going

331
00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:01,440
to ship with the bulk of their core applications isolated, either as flat packs or snaps.

332
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,040
It just seems like the way things are going.

333
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,440
Well, probably because it comes down to trust.

334
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,000
Who do you trust?

335
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,160
Whose software do you trust on your computer?

336
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Right.

337
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:15,520
Going back to Dan Gooden's piece at Ars Technica, it's the attacking the source, where the user

338
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,360
places their trust.

339
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,080
And so you really to have full security, you have to have verification and trust at each

340
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,960
individual step.

341
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,080
That's a lot more work.

342
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,480
But I do actually think we're making good progress that direction.

343
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,480
Better progress than the Windows platform.

344
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,960
Not as good of progress as say, the mobile platforms.

345
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,240
Well, that's been true for quite a while with iOS and increasingly so these days with Android.

346
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,120
But come on, the biggest Android news of the week is that there's going to be no more desserts,

347
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,600
no more sweets, no more Kit Kats and Oreos and all of that.

348
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,920
It's just going to be Android 10.

349
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,080
I was really looking forward to Android Quiche.

350
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,360
I was really hoping this would be the one.

351
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,280
I am a little confused by the choice to go with Android 10.

352
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:08,240
If you check my Twitter feed, I retweeted a number of breakdown of all of the releases

353
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
of Android.

354
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:15,240
And if you count the betas, which is questionable, but if you count the betas, this would be

355
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,060
the 17th public release of Android.

356
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,360
And they're calling it version 10.

357
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:26,720
Yeah, but then they had like various 2.1 here and whatever, they had a lot of point releases.

358
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,200
And this is pretty much Android 10, isn't it?

359
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:38,000
I mean, if you want to talk about in feature quality and completeness, maybe, yeah, I wouldn't

360
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,960
call it version 13 because that's unlucky, that's where Apple's going next.

361
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,120
But 10 feels like they're not owning their progress.

362
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,480
They're like pulling a Microsoft here and just pretending like releases never existed.

363
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,920
This completes Google's transition to the new Microsoft.

364
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,400
They're now Neo-Microsoft.

365
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,520
And they are complete with this crazy naming scheme.

366
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,400
They have now checked all of the boxes.

367
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,880
They just need to call Linux a cancer and then backtrack on it a few years later and

368
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,440
totally embrace it.

369
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,120
Just wait, that'll be during the Fuchsia keynote.

370
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,800
Well, yeah, exactly.

371
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:17,320
They do kind of have a fairly good argument, though, that if you're international, then

372
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,120
some of the ice cream sandwich, for example, we have no clue what that is in this country.

373
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,440
I literally thought it was ice cream and a couple of bits of bread when I first heard

374
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,440
about it.

375
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,080
But that's obviously not what it is.

376
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,640
And in some languages and dialects, like L and R, are hard to distinguish.

377
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:40,040
And so it was a bit immature, wasn't it?

378
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,960
It was a bit of fun to start with.

379
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,960
But to me, it feels like them kind of drawing a line under the fun side of it and being

380
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,480
really serious now.

381
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,720
Android is a serious product to compete with iOS.

382
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:59,880
And we're not just a bunch of geeks over in California putting statues of donuts outside

383
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,540
our offices.

384
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,680
We are deadly serious now.

385
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,780
They've rebranded the visuals to be much more, well, corporate, I suppose.

386
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:12,800
And it just feels like Android growing up with this.

387
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,360
Yeah, I wasn't having it ever, to be honest.

388
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,480
I'm just giving a hard time for the go into 10.

389
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,640
But I never liked the shenanigans.

390
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
I just thought it was silly.

391
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:28,540
It felt like a cute ploy to try to seem like a hipster little startup from a big mega corporation.

392
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:32,000
And now with this rebranding that they've kind of done, they've redone the logo a little

393
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,200
bit and the dropping of the desserts, it does feel like the growing up.

394
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,620
They're breaking outside that enthusiast trap where they're trying to over accommodate the

395
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,280
people that they use to get off the ground.

396
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,720
And now they're trying to sell to the mass market, which is the inevitable outcome of

397
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
the Android initiative.

398
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,560
I think you make a fair point that some of these things don't make any sense outside

399
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
the states either.

400
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,600
That was never really, it never really seemed to make sense either that it was candy when

401
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,800
Google is so like health food oriented, kind of imagery and never really got it.

402
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,720
But it was a way to get some some retweets, I suppose.

403
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,160
There was that little Easter egg where you could get the the Android version.

404
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,480
And it'd be I just keep coming back to KitKat because that's the one that really stuck in

405
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:22,400
my mind because it was the first one where they kind of sold out really and got a brand

406
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,960
on board, especially Nestle, which is not exactly the most ethical company in the world.

407
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,280
I guess my other only thing is I just like the way Android Q sounds like drop the candy

408
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,600
thing and just keep the letter.

409
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,480
Android Q is a rad name.

410
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,920
That's a great name.

411
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,660
But it doesn't matter Android 10, as it will be known, looks like a pretty solid release.

412
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,680
My pixel device is ready and welcoming.

413
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,880
It's funny that I've just updated to Android 9 this week through lineage OS 16.

414
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,840
So I don't think I'll be getting Q or 10 anytime soon.

415
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,200
Just gotta wait till you break the next device, Joe.

416
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,480
Yes, I did have some problems this week, although actually, I saw today that a lot more of the

417
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,480
OnePlus phones now are officially supported with lineage, which is good news, including

418
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,200
the six, which was I think the last one with the headphone jack.

419
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,480
So if and when my 3T dies, I might well be picking up a six.

420
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,240
I gotta admit, I was eyeballing a couple of the one pluses at the sprint that we had recently.

421
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,200
Alex really has a nice one plus, I could see that I may I might not get a pixel next time

422
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,320
I might consider a one plus instead.

423
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,360
Stay tuned and find out actually, stay tuned and find out all of the news in open source

424
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,000
and Linux land go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes

425
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,360
and linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

426
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:45,400
Now here's a last minute FYI, I'm going to Lexington, Kentucky on the 29th.

427
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:52,040
I'll be there at a meetup with a very special guest and a lot more details to come soon.

428
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,200
So probably the best place to go is just meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting because we don't

429
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,940
have it posted yet because we are still working out all the fine last minute stuff.

430
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:06,360
But if you're in that area, Lexington, Kentucky on the 29th of August 2019, I'd love to see

431
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,920
you at dinner meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

432
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,040
So that means you've only got a few days after hearing this.

433
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,100
So yeah, make sure you do check out meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

434
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,520
Now we have some new content for you as well extras dot show, go check that out.

435
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,760
And we have a flash briefing skill now for your Echo device.

436
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,560
Once a week Linux action news in your flash briefing, go check that out.

437
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,520
If you'd like to get us there on your smart Echo thing, I wouldn't know about that.

438
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,200
I don't have things listening to me all the time.

439
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
I'm afraid.

440
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,280
I think I've got one in nearly every room now, Joe.

441
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,560
It's it's like a rash.

442
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
That's one word for it.

443
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
All right.

444
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,240
Well, we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

445
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm at Chris LAS.

446
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,520
I'm at Joe Rissington.

447
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
Thank you for joining us.

448
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,880
We will see you next week.

449
00:26:52,880 --> 00:27:08,880
Have a great day and I'll talk to you later.
