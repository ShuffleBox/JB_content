00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,480
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,080
This is episode two, recorded on May 21st, 2017.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,080
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,000
Now, I really hope we screw this one up.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,560
This is when we have to make all of our mistakes.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
This is just the second episode, so everything has to be wonky.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Okay?

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Do you mind?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,320
No, I'm sure it'll be absolutely perfect, don't worry.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,960
Yeah, we all have a chance to make it perfect if we participate in the future.

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,240
And that's what Ubuntu is going for.

14
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,240
Boy, that is...

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,240
There we go.

16
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,240
See, leave that in there.

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,560
That'll be an example of things I'll never say in the future, Joe.

18
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
Right there.

19
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,960
I'll never do that transition again.

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,960
Because it doesn't matter.

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,780
The Ubuntu desktop team is discussing openly their plans for GNOME in Ubuntu 17.10.

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,800
And it appears to be much more than what Mark led us to believe, huh, Joe?

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,840
I wouldn't go as far as to say much more.

24
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,840
Really?

25
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,720
Because I had been led to believe that it would be basically stock GNOME.

26
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,080
Yeah, me too.

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:11,800
And they are at least considering the possibility of various GNOME extensions and customization,

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,020
but I don't think it's as much as it appears to be.

29
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,240
Because it's one thing to consider it, it's another to actually implement it.

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,440
Okay, fair enough, fair enough.

31
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,880
So this is, a lot of this information is coming from OMG Ubuntu, Ken Van Dyne, who's been

32
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,200
with Canonical for a long time as a software engineer.

33
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,480
He's now part of the Ubuntu desktop team, which, by the way, there's an Ubuntu desktop

34
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
team.

35
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

36
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,480
Yeah, there is a team.

37
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
Okay, we've got that.

38
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
That's a good sign.

39
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
That's a good sign.

40
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,860
And he was chatting with Joey over at OMG Ubuntu, and Joey was asking him several questions.

41
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:50,360
And he was a little evasive, and I don't mean to say evasive in a bad way, but he was evasive

42
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,220
because they don't know all of the answers yet, but he says they're considering a few

43
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:59,320
tweaks here and there to ease users into the new experience.

44
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,240
And so they're looking at things like how to work the existing Unity look into client

45
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,620
side decorations and a few other things.

46
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,480
It looks to me like a lot more than just stock GNOME.

47
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:15,800
Again, I don't think a lot is the right word because there's no HUD, there's no global

48
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
menus.

49
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,780
Yeah, there's no global menus, it essentially is moving ambience over to GNOME with client

50
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,320
side decoration support.

51
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,680
That's really essentially it, plus then maybe a few extensions on top.

52
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,240
I don't know, I think that there are going to be a lot of Unity users who are not going

53
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:39,360
to be happy with the fact that this is their default setup.

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,280
They are going to upgrade potentially from 16.04 to 18.04, or maybe they're on the six

55
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,960
monthly ones and they're going to upgrade from Unity and it's going to be the Unity

56
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,080
story all over again, isn't it?

57
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,320
You had it from GNOME 2 to Unity, suddenly, bam, it's right in front of you.

58
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,520
This is, everything's different.

59
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:03,320
And now you're going to have it again, you've got no desktop, I mean, unless they implement

60
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:08,360
these extensions where you can have a desktop and stuff, I mean, that to me, okay, it might

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,440
seem like a small thing, but to me it's quite a big thing.

62
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,640
You go from having a desktop on which you can put things to a wallpaper that you can't

63
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,200
even right click on and do anything with.

64
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,940
So the two things that jump out at me is it seems that most users that would be on a six

65
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,800
month release cycle would probably be cognizant of the changes coming down the pipeline.

66
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,640
And then the other folks that are switching, maybe just now, or they're upgrading their

67
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,640
installations like you're talking about, I wonder if they're actually doing an upgrade.

68
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:42,400
If they don't take the Unity 7 packages out of the repo, then wouldn't they just upgrade

69
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,920
and keep using Unity?

70
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,840
Well, it looks like Unity is going to be an option if you log out and then you've got

71
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,200
that drop down menu.

72
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,400
So they're going to be in the repo then, the packages?

73
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Yes.

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,720
So you've got the option to go for that, but by default, they're going to push GNOME.

75
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
I wonder.

76
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,240
So the other thing that jumps out at me is where do they draw the line?

77
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,740
So they have a survey that they've launched right now.

78
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,720
They're asking folks via OMG Ubuntu what they would want to see in an Ubuntu GNOME.

79
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,400
And the things that they're considering are what extension should we just bake in?

80
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,040
And they're asking some great questions.

81
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,700
And they're getting some great traction.

82
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,880
But I think I have an issue with the premise.

83
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
What's the issue?

84
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,340
I don't blame them for being uncomfortable shipping a stock GNOME setup.

85
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,320
But if you stack too many extensions into this thing by default, you could be asking

86
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
for a bad time.

87
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,720
Now, they're going to be able to update the packages altogether.

88
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,080
So in theory, you'd have a deb for one of the extensions, and it would get updated when

89
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,980
the GNOME desktop gets updated.

90
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,360
But I do worry that if we go too far, one of the...

91
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,360
So I'll give you an example, Joe.

92
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,800
The one that really bothers me is the applications menu extension, which is under consideration.

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,720
This dramatically changes the interaction with GNOME.

94
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,440
So when you hit the super key, instead of getting the applications full screen overlay

95
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,200
with the overview, you get a menu that drops down that would remind you of Cinnamon.

96
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,760
And this is a pretty big deviation from the standard use of GNOME that you would find,

97
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,320
say on Fedora, or OpenSUSE, or Arch.

98
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,840
Yeah, but it sounds good to me.

99
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,760
But I'm an XFCE user, aren't I?

100
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
So what do you expect?

101
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,680
I suppose it would sound good to a lot of...

102
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,480
It would sound good to a lot of new users, but it totally is forfeiting now the collective

103
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,280
benefit of all of us using a common interface on Linux.

104
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,120
Yeah, but isn't the beauty of GNOME the fact that you do have these extensions, and that

105
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,320
unlike Unity, which was like it or lump it, this is how it is, with GNOME you can have

106
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,320
a bunch of extensions.

107
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,600
You can do whatever you want to it.

108
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,280
I mean, Cinnamon started with a bunch of extensions.

109
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,160
Yes to a degree, but like my uncle always tells me, with great power comes great responsibility.

110
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,280
And I feel like you do have to be careful that you don't completely alter the user experience

111
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,280
from upstream.

112
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,520
You see, I don't agree with that.

113
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:57,000
I think that this is a chance for Canonical to put their stamp on GNOME and using extensions

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,120
which are commonly used.

115
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,280
This isn't some crazy third-party forked code or whatever.

116
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:10,040
It's their chance to stand out against Fedora and other distros that use basically stock

117
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
upstream GNOME.

118
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,640
Yeah, I suppose you're right, Joe, and as long as they're using something that's already

119
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,620
out there in the open that the community is already working on, at the end of the day,

120
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,920
it's not that big of a deviation, and it's something that could be easily turned off.

121
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,560
You know, they're getting a lot of results.

122
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,640
They've had over 16,000 responses taking the 1710 GNOME desktop survey, and they want more.

123
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,920
In fact, they're pleading, go out to omgabuntu.com.

124
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,200
Even if you're not an Ubuntu user, if you have some experience with the GNOME desktop

125
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,080
and you want to give them your take on it, I think it's worth taking the survey.

126
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
I've done it.

127
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,080
Have you taken the survey, Joe?

128
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,520
Yes, I answered one question.

129
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
I have to know.

130
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Buttons on the right, please.

131
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,400
Oh, yes, buttons on the right, please.

132
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
I completely agree.

133
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,280
The GNOME extension, I didn't know enough about.

134
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,940
They all seem fairly sensible to me, but I didn't want to have an influence over something

135
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,120
that I shouldn't, if you know what I mean.

136
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,080
But if you do use GNOME, then definitely, you've got no excuses, really.

137
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,320
I mean, I think it was Popeye and Wimpy were saying this on the Ubuntu podcast.

138
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:11,760
If you don't have your say, and then they don't implement the stuff that you want, then

139
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,400
you can't really complain, can you?

140
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,720
Ubuntu reminds me of many years ago, when they were looking for input on other aspects

141
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,480
of the Ubuntu desktop.

142
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,680
It's in some ways history repeating itself.

143
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,920
And one of the things that's repeating, it was one of my favorite things as a Linux user

144
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
in the past.

145
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,960
Well, speaking of many years past, let's talk about Windows Server.

146
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,840
You used to get involved in that, didn't you?

147
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,840
Oh, I did.

148
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,240
Many, many, many servers I've set up.

149
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,480
And imagine if you could have had the Windows subsystem for Linux on a Windows Server.

150
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,740
Wouldn't that have made things easier?

151
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,740
A game changer.

152
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,040
So many times over the years, I came up with different methods and approaches to get SSH

153
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,120
on a Linux, or I'm sorry, on a Windows box, where I could connect from a Linux box and

154
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,420
do SCP and things like that, or get event logs into syslog and get some sort of equivalency

155
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,600
of cron, because I really was not a big fan of the Windows scheduler.

156
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:02,200
And now, somebody way down in the depths of Microsoft has heard my pain.

157
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,560
And they've announced that coming soon to Windows Server will be the WSL, which is

158
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,520
the Windows subsystem for Linux, on Windows Server.

159
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:16,100
I mean, this is just more admission from Microsoft that Linux has won, isn't it?

160
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,080
The proof will be in the pudding, Joe, on how people actually end up using it.

161
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,680
Will it just be a way to move some of your favorite bash scripts over to Windows and

162
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,000
automate things, or are you going to end up with people running SSH servers and maybe

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,620
NGINX on Windows?

164
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,660
It either way is going to be a huge boon for Linux admins that have to manage these systems,

165
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,580
say under virtualization.

166
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,420
That's got to be a very common use case.

167
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,960
And now, they can take some of their same scripts and manage the Windows boxes.

168
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,440
That's the really big part that Microsoft is pushing.

169
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,600
And they're really trying to downplay the fact that you could probably also run services.

170
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,420
I don't know for sure, but it seems very likely.

171
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,760
But you've got much more experience than me in enterprise, right?

172
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,320
My understanding is that enterprise, desktop-wise, you're basically stuck with Windows.

173
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,180
And that's why the subsystem makes much more sense on Windows 10 desktop.

174
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:10,520
But in terms of Windows Server, isn't Linux much more prevalent there already in the enterprise?

175
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,560
And so it's kind of not as important to be able to have Linux-y stuff on Windows because

176
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,160
you can just run a Linux server if you want to.

177
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,100
To me, it seems like this is also Microsoft trying to make containers like Docker work

178
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,040
on Linux, trying to make the super nano versions of Windows that can run inside VMs or run

179
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
VMs.

180
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,640
And they're trying to also answer the market that is running Windows servers on Linux hosts.

181
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,400
And to me, as a system administrator, if I could run a script to move some files around

182
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,480
that I can run on a Windows system and I can run on a Linux box, that's a huge win.

183
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,680
And it's going to make me more comfortable implementing a Windows system because I can

184
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,860
move that knowledge now over to the Windows box to administer it.

185
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,880
It's fascinating to see Microsoft acknowledge a reality where Linux has a huge presence

186
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
on the server.

187
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,240
And they're trying to make Windows more amenable.

188
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,660
When I was in the enterprise way, way back in the early start, when I first got started,

189
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,960
I watched Microsoft do this same exact thing with Novell's NetWare.

190
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,420
They really made it easy to use Windows with NetWare.

191
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,080
They created their own NetWare client that was integrated into the Windows operating

192
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,080
system.

193
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,280
They made it possible for Windows clients to connect to NetWare shares.

194
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,760
They made it talk all the IPX protocols required to communicate with NetWare.

195
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,760
It was really smooth the way at each layer of the Windows experience from the user layer

196
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,080
to the server layer to the network communications layer.

197
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,960
Over time, they added support for NetWare until NetWare started to decline in market

198
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
share.

199
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,720
And then they started removing support for NetWare.

200
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,400
And then it became more inconvenient and more inconvenient to work with NetWare systems.

201
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,200
And I don't think that's what Microsoft's doing here, but it does strike a similar tone.

202
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,280
Well, you know, I was concerned, I spoke about it on last week's show, about how this

203
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,920
subsystem for Linux is eating away, potentially, at Linux market share.

204
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,080
I just don't see that with adding it to the Windows server, because I think that people

205
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,920
who are really serious about Linux on the server are using it anyway.

206
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,200
And so I think it's probably a good thing, because it's basically adding a little bit

207
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,640
more Linuxy-ness to people who have to use Windows server.

208
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,940
So I don't see it as a threat.

209
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,400
I see it as a good thing, basically.

210
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Yeah.

211
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,940
Yeah, I think I completely agree with your take on it.

212
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,240
The only place I could see it being a bad thing is if you just needed that one open

213
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,340
source application.

214
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,160
Like I was saying earlier, you just need NGINX.

215
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,560
This sort of solves that problem for you.

216
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,660
Now you don't have to hassle with a VM or even a container.

217
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,040
You can just get your Windows server that already has everything else, install NGINX,

218
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
and call it good.

219
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,840
Yeah, I suppose.

220
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,540
We should do a quick follow-up on last week.

221
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:57,180
We talked about how Fedora, SUSE, and Ubuntu are going to be in the Windows app store.

222
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:02,020
And therefore, we assumed they would be on Windows 10 S. Well, Microsoft have clarified

223
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,280
their position on this, and that is not going to be the case.

224
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,640
So the stripped-down, gimped version, I suppose you'd say, of Windows 10 that's going to be

225
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,280
coming out soon, where you can only install stuff from the app store, is not going to

226
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,900
support anything that is command line or basically powerful.

227
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,020
So it's not going to work.

228
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,520
So this idea that students are going to be using these machines and are going to be able

229
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,560
to use Linux or at least the subsystem for Linux, that is not going to happen.

230
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,140
Yeah, they emphatically say so on their MSNDN blog.

231
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,600
They literally bolded and put an exclamation mark on, no, this is not going to happen.

232
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,560
They really want us to know this is not going to happen.

233
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,500
It does strike me this is a policy and not a technological limitation.

234
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,640
So if they felt all of a sudden it would be competitively advantageous to them, they could

235
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,120
flip the switch and turn it on.

236
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:58,200
Well, you say technological reasons, but there's no reason why you can't install any Windows

237
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,040
application on Windows 10 S. It's all policy.

238
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,640
And the policy kind of makes sense to me.

239
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,840
I mean, it seems weird to agree with Microsoft, but if you're going to have a lockdown system,

240
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,440
you don't want to have something that's going to fuck with the underpinnings of the operating

241
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,020
system potentially.

242
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,240
So you're not going to have basically the command prompt at all.

243
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,360
You're not going to have regedit, I wouldn't have thought.

244
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,560
And that makes a ton of sense.

245
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,040
If you want to have something that's going to be strong and stable, to use a phrase that

246
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,480
UK listeners will hate, that's the way to do it.

247
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,640
And it makes sense to me that running this Linux stuff, it's not for the kind of users

248
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,040
who Windows 10 S is aimed at.

249
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
Yeah, fair enough.

250
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
I think you're completely right.

251
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
Yeah.

252
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,280
Well, we don't want to spend too much time talking about Windows, so let's talk about

253
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,080
another app story.

254
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:56,000
And this one has a lot of aspirations for bringing third-party developers to desktop

255
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Linux.

256
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,860
Our friends over at elementary OS have an update to their Loki release.

257
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,480
And for those of you that don't run elementary OS as your daily driver, they've had updates

258
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,840
in December, January, February, and March, and April.

259
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,340
So they've been consistently updating the OS, but this is sort of one update that brings

260
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,440
everything together, including the latest Granite, which is sort of like the go-to spot

261
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,680
for developers, and their big App Center, which is pay for what you want apps.

262
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,280
So if you want to pay $1 or you want to pay $10, it's your choice.

263
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,560
Sort of humble bundle style.

264
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,600
Yeah, or you can pay zero, as I tested, and that is working.

265
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,080
So that's all good.

266
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,520
Yeah, I mean, this is a great idea in theory, and I'll get back to why it's a great idea

267
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,880
in theory in a second, that if you're a developer, you can put your software on there, and people

268
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,160
can either download it for free to try it, or they can chuck you a few dollars if they

269
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,540
want to.

270
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:53,960
And the good thing about the implementation of it is there are no logins, there's no stored

271
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,840
credentials or anything, you just put in your card details, it's handled by Stripe, which

272
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,160
let's hope is secure, and then it just gets dealt with.

273
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,840
And you could say, well, hang on, surely you need an account to get those apps back if

274
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,280
you reinstall or you install on another machine, but well, you can just put in zero, right?

275
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,020
So there's no problem there.

276
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,840
You can support the developers however often or not you're able to.

277
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,720
So in theory, this is great.

278
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,880
In practice, it's not ready yet.

279
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,560
They've pushed it into the distro and it's not ready.

280
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:32,720
I mean, I downloaded the ISO, installed it on a very standard box, which is just an i5

281
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,280
with no discrete graphics, nothing out of the ordinary.

282
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,880
Trisco runs perfectly on this machine, put it that way.

283
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,680
That's how standard it is.

284
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,200
And it just didn't work.

285
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Hang on.

286
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
How do you mean it didn't work?

287
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,200
Okay.

288
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:53,000
So I click on the App Center icon, it thinks about it for a bit, then nothing happens.

289
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,800
What kind of GPU is in the system?

290
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
It's Intel graphics.

291
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Oh, okay.

292
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,920
And so I was like, what the...

293
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,560
And I tried a few times, okay.

294
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,240
I put it on a Kaby Lake system, I did not have this problem.

295
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,860
Well, I mean, this is a second gen i5, so it's pretty old, pretty standard hardware.

296
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:14,920
So I thought, well, I wonder what happens if I do a apt-get update and dist-upgrade,

297
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,360
did that, rebooted, and then it worked perfectly.

298
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,880
So the thing is, so I did get to try it out, but the point is this, elementary is a distro

299
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,320
that is aimed at new users to Linux.

300
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,800
I mean, there's no doubt about that, right?

301
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,320
It's supposed to be a user-friendly, smooth experience.

302
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,300
And yet I'm having to drop to a terminal to fix the problem.

303
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,360
And this was on the release ISO?

304
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Yeah.

305
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
Wow.

306
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,520
I did not run into that problem.

307
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,840
Yeah, okay.

308
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,280
So that seems like that was a bug that you hit.

309
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
I did not run into that.

310
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,000
I was much more impressed because once I launched the App Center, not only was it to pay for

311
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,240
once you want apps, but the other thing they've added is you can install proprietary drivers.

312
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,020
So I needed the Intel microcode for this laptop.

313
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,240
And that was just listed right there as an update inside the App Center.

314
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,240
Easy peasy.

315
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,920
I clicked Update All, got it, and I was done.

316
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:11,000
Yeah, I was offered that and installed it, and that's worked perfectly again after I'd

317
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,160
fixed that little bug in it.

318
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,560
But it just feels that it's just a little bit too early to push it into the mainstream.

319
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Yeah.

320
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,960
Daniel would tell you, the founder of elementary OS, Daniel would tell you that this is a minimum

321
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
viable product.

322
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,400
They built something they can put out the door that they feel works, that has the basic

323
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,040
transaction process.

324
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,920
The other thing you'll note is missing from this is the ability to review or rate applications.

325
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,880
That's obviously something they're going to add, but it just wasn't ready to ship yet.

326
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,120
Yeah, I can't help but think they should have hung on a bit, personally.

327
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,680
I think that they've got their unstable PPAs that you can add, and if you want to test

328
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,720
it for them, there's a huge community doing that for them.

329
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,120
And I think that was the place to put it in, not into the mainstream release yet.

330
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,280
I think give it another bit of development, a bit more testing.

331
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,000
But I'm quite a conservative person.

332
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,640
I'm sitting here running Xubuntu 16.04, so you know.

333
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,760
Fair enough, but I think part of this is they want to start making some money.

334
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,960
They want to give developers a way to make money.

335
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,520
They want to start paying for the developer that they have working on this application.

336
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,860
And so the minimum viable product was the ability to sell apps.

337
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,820
And then adding reviews or other functionality down the road would be something that once

338
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,320
this thing's making money, you fund that development with.

339
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,000
Yeah, okay, that does make a lot of sense, actually.

340
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,980
And I would very much like to see that stuff happen quickly, though.

341
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,080
On the road, sounds a bit nebulous and abstract.

342
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,360
Let's hope they've got a proper roadmap for how quickly this is going to happen.

343
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,640
You know, that's why I've been taking the elementary OS project more seriously in the

344
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,240
last couple of years, because they really do seem to do this right.

345
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,280
So they get together, they fund the sprint where they build the product and the spec.

346
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,580
The first they spec it, then they get a basic product built, then they dev it.

347
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:58,640
And in this case, they even brought somebody in their own team up to an actual paid developer

348
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,760
position to work on this thing.

349
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,920
So that way, they have dedicated internal resources.

350
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:08,360
So as a business, they also shift the business to support something like this that they launch.

351
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,240
And then they get it out the door, they actually ship it.

352
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,240
It didn't take them a year.

353
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,640
Like, it only took them a few months from the crowd funder to actually get it out there

354
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,800
to start making money to pay for the investment that the business has taken the risk to take.

355
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Yeah, that's true.

356
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,240
I was surprised at how quickly it came out, to be fair.

357
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,320
So yeah, well done to them for that, I suppose.

358
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:36,080
I think just a couple more weeks, maybe, but then you end up with Debian, don't you?

359
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,080
I agree.

360
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,880
It does feel very early.

361
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,800
But I guess you do have to start somewhere.

362
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,420
You know, it strikes me, Joe, it's sort of interesting that they're the only distribution

363
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,760
doing this.

364
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,020
Isn't that interesting now?

365
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,880
Because Canonical is not really doing this anymore.

366
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,440
There's no click and run.

367
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,320
Ubuntu Mate has the welcome screen, the boutique, but that's all free stuff.

368
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,960
There's nobody that's really trying to make a profit from an app store on the Linux desktop

369
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
anymore.

370
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,960
They're the only ones.

371
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,800
Yeah, you kind of have to ask yourself, why is that?

372
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,520
If Canonical couldn't make it work, has the technology really changed, have times moved

373
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,720
on for the better for the Linux desktop?

374
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,680
Well, I will give the elementary guys this.

375
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,720
The buying experience is 10 times smoother and much more streamlined on the elementary

376
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,360
app center than it was on the software center under Ubuntu.

377
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,400
Do you remember how you had to have an Ubuntu one account and put your address in there?

378
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,760
This on the elementary OS app center, it's just a little stripe pop up.

379
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,920
Just give me your payment information.

380
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Done.

381
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Yeah, it is much simpler.

382
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:36,800
So hopefully that was the barrier to entry before and hopefully this will take off because

383
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,720
I know people, I heard a lot of stories about developers wanting to make a go of the Ubuntu

384
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,000
one and it never worked out.

385
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,040
So fingers crossed for elementary.

386
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,440
This episode of Linux Action News is brought to you by Linux Academy.

guides and it comes with your own server.

391
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,120
They'll spin up a dedicated server for you on demand.

392
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,920
They have seven plus distributions you can choose from and when you choose that distribution,

393
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,040
not only does the course where update, but so does the virtual machine that they spin

394
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,760
up and of course, as you go, you get to keep track of your progress and see where you're

395
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,240
at and how far you have left to go and pick up right where you left off if you have to

396
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
stop.

397
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,400
And they have virtual labs for AWS that save you those surprise fees, linuxacademy.com

398
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,840
slash unplugged.

399
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,920

It's a platform to learn more about Linux and all of the services that will make you

401
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,480
money like OpenStack, AWS and even Azure and much, much more.

402
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,200
You find it all at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

403
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:51,440
Okay, now I know you're a big fan of Alexa and the Amazon Echo and you've got them controlling

404
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,960
all sorts of things in the studio and we've talked about this, haven't we, that where's

405
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,960
Minecraft?

406
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,960
Why haven't they delivered?

407
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,880
Well, it looks like they are finally ready to ship.

408
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:06,400
This week as you're listening to this, they're going to start shipping out to people, but

409
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,920
it's going to be an advanced prototype, not the final thing and oh yeah, you have to pay

410
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,560
a little bit more delivery.

411
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,360
This happened to me, so I was a backer and I've been getting emails all week and it has

412
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,400
been like salt in the wound, last chance, last chance.

413
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
I get one every day.

414
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:29,200
It's my last chance to spend an additional $250 to get what I backed.

415
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,800
This has happened to me several times now, but it really stings because I know at home

416
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:39,600
I could set up a Raspberry Pi 3, a USB microphone and a speaker and I basically have the same

417
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
thing.

418
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,040
I'm never compelled to go dump an additional $250 and I can't be the only one feeling this

419
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,040
way.

420
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
What level did you back it at then?

421
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,440
You know, Joe, it was so long ago.

422
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,200
I tried to find out, but it was so long ago, I don't recall, but I backed it at a level.

423
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,100
I can tell you this, I backed it at a level where I could get a piece of hardware soon

424
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,360
enough that I could be one of the first people on a podcast talking about it.

425
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,320
That's the level I backed it at.

426
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
Yeah.

427
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,600
And yet you still haven't had anything from them.

428
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
No, no.

429
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,640
I don't really at this point expect much.

430
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,760
In fact, Mycroft themselves said that anyone that wants a polished retail level experience

431
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,360
should probably wait around, oh, I don't know, until February 2018.

432
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,920
That does not look good, does it?

433
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,920
No.

434
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:29,560
I mean, with Amazon moving forward, with Google obviously moving forward and rumors of Apple

435
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:34,080
shipping a Siri in a tube, I got to imagine that this is going to be two years too late.

436
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,080
Yeah.

437
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,520
But when they did the crowd funder, and let's not forget they did two, an Indiegogo and

438
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,560
a Kickstarter, that was the time to deliver it.

439
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,340
I do want to be really wrong about this because I really would love to see them succeed.

440
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:53,560
So I say all of this with the hope that maybe long term they have a chance, but right now

441
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,300
they themselves admit they have a long way to go.

442
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,800
In their recent post, they say we're currently working on their if then, then that skill,

443
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,260
Pandora functionality, Netflix integration and more.

444
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:10,200
They're also working to improve the overall voice interaction, making it easier for users

445
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,660
to manage skills and settings and et cetera.

446
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:18,060
So they have quite a ways to go because right now the competitors on the market can do all

447
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,560
of these things and they've been able to do these things for a while.

448
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,440
And this is where open source often finds itself, don't you think?

449
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,900
Yeah, I think that's fair to say really.

450
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:31,520
And it is just massively too late in this particular case.

451
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,560
Even with open source, it can be a little bit lagging behind and maybe not quite as

452
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,000
good, but it's just far, far too late.

453
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:47,280
I mean, that said, I am somewhat baffled that anyone would want to talk to a computer.

454
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,120
I mean, I know that you like to control your lights and stuff.

455
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,060
You've got like kind of a relevant use case for it, but the kind of person who sticks

456
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,380
it in their house and just asks it the weather and the news and stuff.

457
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,240
I mean, like even you using it for something practical.

458
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,920
Don't you feel like a bit of a dickhead to talk into it?

459
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,320
I definitely did at first.

460
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,680
So the way you feel is 100% the way I felt before I tried it.

461
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
And that's why I tried it.

462
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,960
I wanted to challenge myself because I thought it was ridiculous.

463
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,520
And to be honest with you, Joe, you have Google Assistant if you're on Android and you've

464
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,880
got slow mo if you're on the iPhone and they can do a lot of this stuff.

465
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,800
So I thought this was going to be a obvious loser.

466
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,560
And I would agree if you just use it for asking it basic information, there's no point.

467
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,640
There's really no point.

468
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:38,120
However, if you do integrate it in with components in your household or in your studio or where

469
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,840
you work, or when Dell made the case with the Edge X Foundry stuff in a manufacturing

470
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,580
plant, then I start to see a lot more use cases for it.

471
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,660
And I could see where Mycroft would actually be more useful.

472
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:53,840
And I also imagine a scenario where you could have home entertainment integrators that could

473
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,760
integrate Mycroft throughout the house.

474
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,840
Because one of the great things about Mycroft is you can have a central system, if I recall.

475
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,040
One central brain, sort of Iron Man style, where you have Jarvis in one spot and all

476
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,600
of the devices are connected to that one central brain.

477
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,600
Picture a huge mansion full of entertainment systems and smart devices with one central

478
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,440
Mycroft managing it all.

479
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,040
That's a future I could dig.

480
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
Yeah.

481
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,200
Well, we'll have to see what happens, whether they actually deliver it.

482
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,600
They made a lot of promises, or rather someone who worked for them made a lot of promises.

483
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,040
And then he left for whatever reason.

484
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,880
So we'll just have to see whether they can deliver on the promises that he made.

485
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,400
But yeah, we'll watch this space and we might report back next week.

486
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,960
We'll see what happens.

487
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,080
But anyway, let's talk about Google I.O.

488
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,980
We talked about it at the end of last week's show, I think.

489
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,780
Now I've got a question for you.

490
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:50,080
Was there anything that really stood out as interesting to you at Google I.O.?

491
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,880
Besides Project Treble, which we already talked about, I would have to say that just Android

492
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,840
O itself seems like it'll be a decent update for those of us that are using Android.

493
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,940
I like notification dots that remind me of what I get on iOS.

494
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:10,200
And I'm glad they're finally instituting iOS-like background limits, which will be pretty much,

495
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,320
I think, in line with what much of us expect from our smartphone.

496
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,160
And if you're not familiar, it just puts limits on background location and Wi-Fi scans and

497
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,760
things like that that sometimes apps can go crazy with.

498
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
What about you?

499
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,080
Yeah, I mean, they call that vitals, don't they?

500
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,200
Battery life and smoothness.

501
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,680
And I think that that is very important.

502
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:36,220
I mean, they basically have said that in Android O, there's going to be a few new features

503
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,240
like the picture-in-picture and stuff.

504
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,240
But generally speaking, most of the work that they're doing is on stability and kind of

505
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,920
background plumbing, which is good to see.

506
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,020
I agree.

507
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:53,520
Did you see the stuff about Android Go, which seems to be like an effort to make Android

508
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,960
more usable on lower-end devices?

509
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,480
So devices that have one gig or less than memory, they're going to say that's going

510
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,920
to be the Android Go experience, where they've optimized Android O to run smoothly on those

511
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
devices.

512
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
Yeah.

513
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,120
It's such a brilliantly novel idea, isn't it?

514
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,680
Like Android targeted at low-end phones for developing markets.

515
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,680
You'd think that maybe they would have done this before at some point.

516
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Hmm.

517
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
Hang on.

518
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
Android One.

519
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,680
Oh.

520
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
Isn't that what that was?

521
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,680
Yeah, that was my first thought, too.

522
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,920
Although I do like this approach, so it's less of a let's break into emerging markets

523
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:30,360
and more of a let's just target low-end devices.

524
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,400
And by doing so, let's take a look at some of our apps.

525
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,200
Let's make things like YouTube and Chrome use a little less memory, maybe use a little

526
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,640
less storage space and mobile data.

527
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,720
And that could affect and improve Android apps across the ecosystem.

528
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Oh, yeah.

529
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,960
I mean, I think it's good news, generally, to slim down stuff and make it more efficient.

530
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:51,960
But I mean, it is definitely...

531
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,720
I mean, they talk about the building for billions program.

532
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,640
So I mean, this is clearly aimed at the developing market.

533
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:06,240
But they've maybe realized that it's not enough to just make Android, the operating system,

534
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,240
work on low-end hardware.

535
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,240
They need to make the applications as well.

536
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,960
The thing about this is it could also lock in Android applications to being essentially

537
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:22,160
low-quality, low-end, lowest common denominator applications, even less competitive with iOS.

538
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,160
Maybe.

539
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:27,840
But you think about it, if you've got super high-end hardware running software that's

540
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,120
designed for lower-end hardware, it's going to run so smoothly that, okay, it might not

541
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,080
have necessarily all the features of iOS.

542
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,000
But if you've got a really smooth experience, and I mean, look, let's face facts.

543
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You're using an iPhone.

544
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,680
There's got to be a reason for that.

545
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,720
I don't like Android.

546
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,800
I think Android is basically unstable, crashy, and slow and shit.

547
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:57,920
But at the same time, I like the fact that I can configure it and customize it how I

548
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:03,120
want and the fact that it is a little bit more open than iOS, and also it's a lot cheaper

549
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,240
as well.

550
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:11,800
But there is this chasm between iOS and Android, as far as I can see, in terms of the user

551
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
experience.

552
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:19,680
Again, that is similar to the chasm between Mac OS and other operating systems.

553
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,520
It's to do with controlling the hardware as well as the software.

554
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,280
You're going to have a better experience.

555
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,600
But generally speaking, the way Android is written and just put together is just terrible

556
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,680
as far as I can see.

557
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
Yeah.

558
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,880
And Samsung would seem to agree with you.

559
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,880
Well, yeah.

560
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,360
I mean, that's why they have been backing this Tizen horse for a long time now.

561
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,360
It's been a very slow burn.

562
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,800
There have only been four phones, I think, in total, one of which has been released recently.

563
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,600
But it's kind of their backup plan, isn't it?

564
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,480
And they have announced this week that they are looking to use Tizen in their IoT stuff

565
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,920
rather than Android things.

566
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,940
Well, I mean, they didn't overtly say rather than Android things, but that's what you've

567
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,180
got to read into it.

568
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,560
That would be the other option.

569
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,720
And to my surprise, it's not straight up Tizen.

570
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,320
It's Tizen RT, which would obviously stand for real time, like a more streamlined real

571
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,760
time version of Tizen.

572
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
Yeah.

573
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,600
And they want to get it on all of their home appliances by 2020, which is not very long

574
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:20,740
in terms of these industrial timescales, is it?

575
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,840
And so you're going to have smart fridges, smart washing machines, all shit that I have

576
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,040
no interest in personally, but I think people do.

577
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,520
And instead of looking to Google, they're looking to do it in-house with Tizen.

578
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,400
I don't think people have an interest yet.

579
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,280
If they get it right, people would.

580
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:44,240
If, for example, I could have a push notification go to my phone when my oven was done with

581
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,240
something, I might potentially find that useful from time to time, but the implementation

582
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,600
is going to really matter.

583
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,960
And they say their goal, this was a report that was over at TizenExperts.com, and they

584
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,160
were at an event where all of this was being discussed.

585
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,680
And they were interviewing Samsung reps, and they say their goal is to have all home appliances

586
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:08,840
smart to create devices that work in sync and communicate according to Samsung's Internet

587
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,560
of Things agenda.

588
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:16,040
That's scary sounding, isn't it?

589
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,760
And the example they give sounds so horrible.

590
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:23,840
Imagine you're in the middle of a riveting scene, and you get a pop-up notification on

591
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,560
your TV that your laundry is done.

592
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,800
That is not what I want, but that's what they're trying to build.

593
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,680
Their agenda sounds like a threat, doesn't it, IoT agenda?

594
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,680
Yeah.

595
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,800
You know what else Samsung was bragging about, which I don't really know, because Tizen's

596
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,120
adoption is not huge, but here's some perspective for you.

597
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,380
They confirmed, this is from Samsung, that Tizen has surpassed BlackBerry OS in smartphone

598
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:54,520
usage to become the fourth largest smartphone OS in two years, and Tizen has also surpassed

599
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:00,200
Android Wear in market share to become the second most used wearable platform.

600
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:08,920
But that says less about the success of Tizen on wearables than it does about the success

601
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,400
or failure of Android Wear and wearables in general.

602
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,200
I know that Apple are doing okay with their watch, but they're not doing as well as they

603
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,440
hoped.

604
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,920
And it seems like every week, or at least every few weeks, I'm seeing headlines about

605
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,080
another manufacturer is stopping making smart watches because they're just not selling well

606
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,080
enough.

607
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,080
Yeah.

608
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,080
I would say I agree.

609
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,560
It does say more about how the wearable market's doing in general, and I think it also does

610
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:39,220
say how the entire wearable market is doing versus the Apple Watch.

611
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,680
The Apple Watch does seem to be selling, but I think you're probably right, Joe.

612
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,400
I don't think it's probably selling as well as Apple wants, and there's been rumors recently

613
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:52,120
about them adding glucose monitoring and all kinds of things, which I got to say, as somebody

614
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:59,000
who has experimented with a couple of Pebbles, three Android Wear watches, couple of Apple

615
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Watches.

616
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,560
Here at Jupiter Broadcasting, we kind of pass equipment around, so we all kind of like somebody

617
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,600
gets it and we all kind of get to try it out for a little while, and for a good amount

618
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,760
of time, six months or so.

619
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,040
I have to say out of all of them, probably the health monitoring on the Apple Watch is

620
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,320
pretty solid.

621
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,400
They have some good stuff there, and Google Health has been getting better and better

622
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,260
at Google Fit, I guess, but it really, if you're into that kind of stuff, so if you're

623
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,440
somebody who goes for an evening walk, for example, and you want to see if you're progressively

624
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,080
walking further or faster, it's nice for that kind of stuff.

625
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:38,520
If you're somebody who is less inclined to get out, but if you can gamify it a little

626
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:43,360
bit and there is a goal that you will complete, if you just go for a little bit further of

627
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:49,200
a walk and it's just one more thing that inclines you to go, I find it useful for that kind

628
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,200
of stuff.

629
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,520
And whoever nails that the best, and it could be Fitbit for all I know, but whoever nails

630
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,720
that the best will probably have the most successful wearable product.

631
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,120
And until then, Tizen can sell hundreds of thousands, and Android Wear can sell hundreds

632
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,800
of thousands, and Apple Watch will sell a few million, I think.

633
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,400
Yeah, sounds about right.

634
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,800
Now Joe, we have some good news.

635
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,760
For those of you who like to consume this show in video, we have new video feeds that

636
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,840
will be live as of this episode.

637
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,440
They'll be embedded at the Jupiter Broadcasting website with each episode post, but you can

638
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,760
also grab the feed at linuxactionnews.com slash video.

639
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,720
Yeah, and there was kind of a mixed reaction to the video that you put together for the

640
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
first episode, wasn't there?

641
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,800
It was a bit psychedelic.

642
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
I would say.

643
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,960
Yeah, sorry about that.

644
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,200
I quite liked it.

645
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,280
I was trying to go for something new, as you know, because we were chatting about it.

646
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,200
Yeah, I think it looked all right, but some people thought it was a bit headache-inducing,

647
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,720
but hopefully this one will be better.

648
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,760
Yeah, we'll make a few tweaks over the next couple of weeks, and don't forget, the audio

649
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,360
feeds are always available, linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe, and you can tweet feedback

650
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,480
or stories, twitter.com slash linuxactionnews.

651
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,600
Yeah, and a quick plug for User Error, which has come back.

652
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,680
Brand new episode just came out this week.

653
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,040
I loved it.

654
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
It was a lot of fun.

655
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,880
We'll have some good Linux content in there, so go listen to User Error, and then after

656
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,200
you're done, go check out Late Night Linux.

657
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:12,880
Yeah, my other show, latenightlinux.com, with iKey from the Solus project, and a couple

658
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,280
of other guys who are not going to get a mention.

659
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
We love them, though.

660
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
No, Phelan and Jesse.

661
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,200
Yeah, it's a good group of guys.

662
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,920
We have a good laugh on that show, so check it out, latenightlinux.com.

663
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,620
Okay everyone, thank you for tuning into this week's episode of Linux Action News.

664
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,880
We'll be back next Monday at linuxactionnews.com.

665
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,840
I'm at Chris LAS.

666
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,540
I'm at Joe Ressington.

667
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,600
And we'll see you right back here next Monday.

668
00:36:36,600 --> 00:37:04,760
See you later.
