Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

00:05.280 --> 00:08.960
Episode 114, recorded on July 12th, 2019.

00:08.960 --> 00:09.960
I'm Chris.

00:09.960 --> 00:10.960
And I'm Joe.

00:10.960 --> 00:11.960
Hello, Joe.

00:11.960 --> 00:12.960
Good to be connected with you.

00:12.960 --> 00:15.280
Thanks for doing this one a little early to help me out.

00:15.280 --> 00:19.040
And we start out with a bit of bad news for the Pale Moon project.

00:19.040 --> 00:23.960
Yeah, their archive server was compromised, and it looks like it was quite some time ago.

00:23.960 --> 00:30.060
At first, it looked like it was 18 months ago, but now it looks like it's some point

00:30.060 --> 00:32.080
between April and June this year.

00:32.080 --> 00:34.280
Yeah, the initial headlines were really dramatic.

00:34.280 --> 00:38.120
It had been compromised for a long time, but further investigation revealed perhaps it

00:38.120 --> 00:39.120
wasn't as...

00:39.120 --> 00:43.680
Well, I guess it's still pretty significant, but it wasn't as significant as initially

00:43.680 --> 00:44.680
reported.

00:44.680 --> 00:47.960
For those of you that don't remember, Pale Moon is a fork of the Firefox project.

00:47.960 --> 00:52.360
They forked back when there was a change in the Firefox extension.

00:52.360 --> 00:55.820
So it's got a slightly different UI and a different extensions architecture, which some

00:55.820 --> 00:58.520
people still feel is very useful.

00:58.520 --> 01:04.420
It appears a malicious party gained access to the Windows server that runs the archive,

01:04.420 --> 01:07.920
which they had been renting from a provider.

01:07.920 --> 01:13.800
Someone got on there, ran a script, and selectively infected all of the pale moon.exe archive

01:13.800 --> 01:16.400
files stored on that box.

01:16.400 --> 01:20.480
The Pale Moon developer said he just recently learned of the incident about July 8th as

01:20.480 --> 01:21.480
we record this episode.

01:21.480 --> 01:26.280
Yeah, so it looks like this is only the Windows builds that were affected, so hopefully nothing

01:26.280 --> 01:27.280
to panic about.

01:27.280 --> 01:33.720
But it does illustrate some of the difficulties, shall we say, that smaller projects come up

01:33.720 --> 01:34.720
against.

01:34.720 --> 01:39.900
I think it's actually maybe even highlighting a larger issue, where in open source, it's

01:39.900 --> 01:44.160
common to fork a project, and that can often lead to great results.

01:44.160 --> 01:45.620
We've seen that.

01:45.620 --> 01:50.800
But this and other recent incidents are kind of underscoring that concern that maybe there

01:50.800 --> 01:54.800
is some software that's just becoming too complex for a really small team to run.

01:54.800 --> 01:58.560
I don't think it necessarily has to do with the complexity of the software itself.

01:58.560 --> 02:04.640
I think it's more the complexity of running a project, which is about way more than just

02:04.640 --> 02:05.640
the software itself.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.520
There's all the infrastructure.

02:07.520 --> 02:14.040
And if you're only a small team, then can you really be expected to know enough about

02:14.040 --> 02:21.000
security and system administration and everything if what you're good at is developing software?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Fair enough.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.980
In fact, in most of the breaches that I'm thinking of here, it's been infrastructure

02:24.980 --> 02:30.040
attacks that it just seems clear the team didn't have resources to properly manage both

02:30.040 --> 02:35.240
the software development and the infrastructure side, because they both can be very time-consuming

02:35.240 --> 02:39.640
jobs, especially if it's a project that has some user base to it.

02:39.640 --> 02:40.880
So yeah, I guess you're right.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.580
There really are two separate issues here.

02:42.580 --> 02:47.760
There's the complexity of software maintainership and the complexity of infrastructure maintainership.

02:47.760 --> 02:54.160
And a project like Pale Moon or others have to be good at both to be secure for end users.

02:54.160 --> 02:59.840
Which is why I would reluctantly not recommend that people use software from smaller projects

02:59.840 --> 03:00.840
like this.

03:00.840 --> 03:04.680
I know that might be controversial, but if you go with something like Firefox, you've

03:04.680 --> 03:09.400
got a huge organization who are maintaining it and looking after all the infrastructure.

03:09.400 --> 03:15.160
And yes, they make missteps from time to time, but not on this scale.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.200
This is really bad.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.280
And okay, it's only the Archive server, so it's only older versions.

03:20.280 --> 03:23.440
But do we even know whether that's the extent of it?

03:23.440 --> 03:29.200
Because they've written this post-mortem on their PHP BB forum, which should just raise

03:29.200 --> 03:33.680
alarm bells anyway, anyone running PHP BB at this stage.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.840
But the post-mortem is not really a proper post-mortem either.

03:36.840 --> 03:42.760
It's just really almost like a blog post about it, or a forum post in this case.

03:42.760 --> 03:49.840
And it just makes them seem like quite an amateurish project, which is not a very nice

03:49.840 --> 03:52.720
thing to say, but that's how it comes across.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.840
See, this is what I'm struggling with.

03:54.840 --> 04:00.240
Because you don't want to live in a world where it's too hard to stand up services and

04:00.240 --> 04:03.520
projects have to always use commercial hosted services.

04:03.520 --> 04:07.440
Because A, I don't think that's true, and B, that's not a future I want to live in.

04:07.440 --> 04:12.720
But at the same time, there is a burden of responsibility for something like a web browser

04:12.720 --> 04:20.800
that is handling users' private information, and just their overall systems are to be respected.

04:20.800 --> 04:25.760
It's your duty as a project to keep their system safe when they're using your software.

04:25.760 --> 04:30.400
And in the case of this Pale Moon attack, the attackers, surprise, surprise, were going

04:30.400 --> 04:32.440
for some crypto jacking.

04:32.440 --> 04:35.960
They wanted to infect the browser with some crypto jacking malware.

04:35.960 --> 04:39.560
It wouldn't have been the end of the world, but it would have been harmful to the end

04:39.560 --> 04:40.560
users.

04:40.560 --> 04:42.760
So there is that burden there.

04:42.760 --> 04:46.520
At the same time, even the big guys don't always get it right.

04:46.520 --> 04:51.000
Remember recently, Mozilla had quite the outage that just really turned out to be the root

04:51.000 --> 04:53.440
cause was an expired certificate.

04:53.440 --> 04:58.920
Yeah, this was back in May when suddenly everyone's add-ons just stopped working.

04:58.920 --> 05:03.240
And yeah, as you say, turned out to be because of a certificate that expired.

05:03.240 --> 05:07.240
And it's been quite a while, but now we do have some details on this.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.040
And it really is just mismanagement.

05:10.040 --> 05:13.880
I do appreciate them releasing a post-mortem though, like we'd all kind of moved on, kind

05:13.880 --> 05:14.880
of forgotten.

05:14.880 --> 05:20.560
And it's good on Mozilla that they're willing to kind of point a finger at what they got

05:20.560 --> 05:22.560
wrong again.

05:22.560 --> 05:27.180
And post this for everyone to review, because these are some of the most educational kind

05:27.180 --> 05:31.820
of documents for people that are trying to learn how to secure real infrastructure.

05:31.820 --> 05:35.000
Learning from other people's mistakes is one of the cheapest way to learn.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.960
And I really appreciate it when companies post this.

05:37.960 --> 05:39.200
And this is rather thorough.

05:39.200 --> 05:44.560
In fact, they break down the specific root cause of why they failed to update the expired

05:44.560 --> 05:45.560
certificate.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.860
Like you think it's just something really super simple, but it turned out to be several

05:48.860 --> 05:51.560
layers of failure essentially within the organization.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.800
It's kind of a harsh way to put it, but basically what happened.

05:54.800 --> 05:59.200
But it looks like this isn't going to happen again, and crucially they are looking at better

05:59.200 --> 06:02.520
ways to fix it if something like this does happen.

06:02.520 --> 06:07.720
Because they fixed it with their studies system, which is just not even designed for this at

06:07.720 --> 06:08.720
all.

06:08.720 --> 06:13.760
So they're looking into better ways to release quick patches in the future.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.500
So hopefully some good will come out of all of this.

06:16.500 --> 06:20.400
We were just once again talking about Mozilla last week, they are in the news a lot.

06:20.400 --> 06:24.000
This time it was because they were labeled a villain by the ISPA.

06:24.000 --> 06:28.880
Yeah, the ISPA who call themselves the voice of the UK internet industry.

06:28.880 --> 06:32.380
It's a kind of industry body for ISPs.

06:32.380 --> 06:40.600
And they had labeled Mozilla a villain because of their enabling of DNS over HTTPS, or DOA

06:40.600 --> 06:42.320
as everyone's calling it.

06:42.320 --> 06:46.920
But now the ISPA have backtracked, although not fully.

06:46.920 --> 06:52.580
They've kind of stuck a few boots in to Mozilla, but yeah, they've withdrawn their nomination

06:52.580 --> 06:54.160
for internet villain at least.

06:54.160 --> 06:59.360
Yeah, they're totally backtracking, except for these six specific reasons they're totally

06:59.360 --> 07:00.360
right.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.280
Yeah, they couldn't just say no, we were wrong.

07:03.280 --> 07:07.120
They are trying to walk back their position a bit here.

07:07.120 --> 07:10.380
In fact, the way they write about it, it's like they're new to the internet, which is

07:10.380 --> 07:14.440
adorable because they're, like you said, supposed to be the voice of the industry over there.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.740
And yet it's like they don't know how the internet works.

07:16.740 --> 07:20.600
They write, in the 21 years the event has been running, it's probably fair to say that

07:20.600 --> 07:25.380
no other nomination has generated such strong opinion.

07:25.380 --> 07:30.360
They go on to say, we have previously given the award to the home secretary for pushing

07:30.360 --> 07:36.960
surveillance legislation to regimes of leaders that are limiting freedom, but Mozilla was

07:36.960 --> 07:39.640
aligned too far for them, I guess.

07:39.640 --> 07:43.100
And then they try to backtrack this whole thing by saying, but really, we're just trying

07:43.100 --> 07:48.940
to draw attention to DNS over HTTPS and how different implementations could be bad.

07:48.940 --> 07:50.340
That is worth talking about.

07:50.340 --> 07:56.760
They're also trying to throw shade on DNS over HTTPS, and I'm not really a big fan of

07:56.760 --> 07:57.760
that.

07:57.760 --> 07:58.760
I actually think it's kind of cool tech.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.800
Again, it just comes down to implementations every single time.

08:00.800 --> 08:07.380
Well, you guys did a great breakdown of DOE on the last Linux Unplugged, so linuxunplugged.com

08:07.380 --> 08:09.800
slash 309, check that out.

08:09.800 --> 08:13.340
Some ways to implement it yourself and some good discussion on that.

08:13.340 --> 08:18.680
New version of Firefox 68 also landed this week with the dark mode reader view, which

08:18.680 --> 08:20.800
is kind of what I'm excited about.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.480
Also nice to see a new ESR release based on 68 now too.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.280
Yeah, it looks to be a very solid release.

08:26.280 --> 08:29.160
I haven't actually got it yet on Ubuntu.

08:29.160 --> 08:32.360
I'm waiting for that update, but I'm sure it will come down pretty soon.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.040
Also a bit of follow up from another story last week.

08:35.040 --> 08:40.280
It looks like Microsoft is going to be accepted into that Linux distros mailing list.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.880
This is a post on that mailing list.

08:41.880 --> 08:46.040
They write, Microsoft doesn't look all that different from many other large corporations,

08:46.040 --> 08:50.200
including some which already have their Linux distro teams represented on the list.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.420
There's another kind of interesting conversation that's now happening on the side.

08:53.420 --> 08:55.880
It's like, what do we bring Microsoft in as?

08:55.880 --> 09:01.200
They say, maybe we shouldn't label them as just Microsoft as a member of the Linux distros.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.920
Microsoft is much more than just their Linux based products and services.

09:04.920 --> 09:10.020
We list Amazon Linux, AMI rather than Amazon and Chrome OS rather than Google.

09:10.020 --> 09:13.520
And we also separately have Android listed rather than Google.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.680
And it seems like a funny thing to kind of be going back and forth about, but it really

09:16.680 --> 09:21.960
comes down to setting the expectation for researchers that are interacting with this

09:21.960 --> 09:23.760
Linux distros mailing list.

09:23.760 --> 09:27.760
You'll recall this is really a list to discuss security issues.

09:27.760 --> 09:31.620
And so researchers will interact with this list, and they don't want them to have the

09:31.620 --> 09:35.920
mistaken impression that because Microsoft is now on the list, that they can notify Microsoft

09:35.920 --> 09:39.380
about their other products issues.

09:39.380 --> 09:43.160
It's a small thing, but when you think about something five, 10 years down the road, it

09:43.160 --> 09:44.840
really makes a big difference.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.040
So now they're working out the semantics.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.520
I don't think there was ever any doubt this was going to happen, Joe.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.480
You had Greg KH backing this.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.280
All kinds of big companies are in this list.

09:52.280 --> 09:53.280
Oh, yeah.

09:53.280 --> 09:58.240
There was a little bit of dissent on the list from people who used M$ sign.

09:58.240 --> 10:01.400
So they were just ignored, obviously.

10:01.400 --> 10:08.440
And it seems that this list is for grown ups, really, who accept that Microsoft are running

10:08.440 --> 10:11.760
some Linux products now, some distros, essentially.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.720
And that they really ought to have access to this.

10:14.720 --> 10:17.680
And yeah, they are no different from any other huge company.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.640
Obviously, you need to watch them, but you judge them by their actions.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.040
Well, how about another follow up?

10:23.040 --> 10:28.280
The Raspberry Pi Foundation has confirmed that the recently released Raspberry Pi 4

10:28.280 --> 10:31.080
may not work when using certain USB-C cables.

10:31.080 --> 10:36.520
Yeah, this really comes down to a resistor which costs a fraction of a dollar.

10:36.520 --> 10:41.360
And I saw some maths that said if they sold a million units of these Raspberry Pi 4s,

10:41.360 --> 10:46.040
they might save $500 by cutting this tiny corner.

10:46.040 --> 10:50.960
And for that $500, I think it's going to cost them a lot more than that in bad PR.

10:50.960 --> 10:55.680
Well, and they're also going to have to do some engineering to revise this and then update

10:55.680 --> 10:58.440
the boards and manufacture those as well.

10:58.440 --> 11:03.600
Because the foundation has said they're going to attempt to address this in a hardware revision,

11:03.600 --> 11:09.680
which means if you bought one early, like I did, you're probably stuck with this particular

11:09.680 --> 11:10.680
challenge.

11:10.680 --> 11:11.680
But it's not too bad.

11:11.680 --> 11:15.560
Really, it's the smart chargers that are a quote unquote e-marked cable.

11:15.560 --> 11:19.880
They try to suss out what the Raspberry Pi is and they will incorrectly detect it as

11:19.880 --> 11:20.880
an audio adapter.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.580
Then it just doesn't supply the right amount of power.

11:24.580 --> 11:30.220
Almost all of the cheapo USB-C cables and stuff that come with like Android phones,

11:30.220 --> 11:31.560
they will work.

11:31.560 --> 11:36.360
It's really the nicer ones like laptops or nicer, smarter, quote unquote cables that

11:36.360 --> 11:37.360
you're going to have a problem with.

11:37.360 --> 11:41.160
And if you buy the power adapter with the Raspberry Pi, you're going to be fine.

11:41.160 --> 11:46.280
Yeah, I was suddenly very happy that I was forced to buy a semi-official one that has

11:46.280 --> 11:48.480
worked absolutely perfectly for me.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.040
So yeah, no problems.

11:50.040 --> 11:55.280
And that's what they suggest, buy an official power supply, which is a bit rich, isn't it?

11:55.280 --> 12:01.280
Yeah, although it seems, and this isn't 100%, but it seems most cables that are USB-A to

12:01.280 --> 12:08.560
USB-C or USB-B to C, they typically are just dumb pass-through cables and if they can supply

12:08.560 --> 12:09.840
enough power, you're good.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.320
They are typically not e-marked.

12:11.320 --> 12:16.600
Yeah, so it's not a huge issue, but it is still pretty embarrassing for Raspberry Pi.

12:16.600 --> 12:21.960
What is huge is that IBM's acquisition of Red Hat has officially closed, with the exception

12:21.960 --> 12:23.240
of Brazil.

12:23.240 --> 12:31.000
This is that $34 billion acquisition and I believe the final number was $190 per share

12:31.000 --> 12:36.560
in cash, plus some loans on IBM's side, and we got ourselves a final deal.

12:36.560 --> 12:41.960
Yeah, and once again, they're talking up the hybrid cloud stuff and how nothing's really

12:41.960 --> 12:47.320
going to change at Red Hat and it's just they're going to have the sales power of IBM and their

12:47.320 --> 12:51.120
experience and everything, and the Fedora project leader, Matthew Miller, has made some

12:51.120 --> 12:55.860
comments saying that Fedora's fine, it's going to just carry on as it is.

12:55.860 --> 13:00.800
And so it's really the message is business as usual, but just more of it.

13:00.800 --> 13:05.000
For me personally, the Fedora side of the story is interesting.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.200
It's hard to really say what happens in Red Hat.

13:07.200 --> 13:12.820
It's going to be harder to measure from the outside, but what happens to Fedora will be

13:12.820 --> 13:17.840
right in front of all of us and I'll be watching and I think Matthew Miller knows that a lot

13:17.840 --> 13:18.840
of us are watching.

13:18.840 --> 13:22.760
That's why he got out there really early and started talking about how this change is nothing,

13:22.760 --> 13:25.160
we're continuing on, and we'll see about that.

13:25.160 --> 13:30.760
I hope so because a lot of the community depends on some really great projects that are born

13:30.760 --> 13:31.760
out of Fedora.

13:31.760 --> 13:32.760
Matthew Feeney Yeah.

13:32.760 --> 13:37.560
And IBM and Red Hat are very aware of that and so you would hope that Fedora would be

13:37.560 --> 13:42.640
left alone to do its thing and make its own decisions because it's the sort of canary

13:42.640 --> 13:44.200
in the coal mine, isn't it?

13:44.200 --> 13:49.480
But as I said at the time of the announcement of this deal, I honestly think it's good.

13:49.480 --> 13:55.520
I know some people are very kind of skeptical about it, but I think that IBM really will

13:55.520 --> 14:01.400
just use their sales experience and all the money that they've got and the infrastructure

14:01.400 --> 14:08.120
to just facilitate Red Hat doing what it does, which is create a bunch of open source software

14:08.120 --> 14:11.720
and sell services very profitably around that software.

14:11.720 --> 14:12.960
Joe Quirk We'll see.

14:12.960 --> 14:15.880
It's definitely one of the more fascinating stories of the last few years.

14:15.880 --> 14:19.480
One of the most fascinating stories of the software industry ever, actually.

14:19.480 --> 14:20.480
We'll see where it goes.

14:20.480 --> 14:21.480
We'll see, Joe.

14:21.480 --> 14:25.080
In the meantime, I'm a little more upset about what's going on potentially with Nome

14:25.080 --> 14:27.360
software and support for SNAPs.

14:27.360 --> 14:33.480
Yeah, it looks like in Fedora 31, the SNAP plugin is going to be disabled in GNOME software.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.640
It was definitely trending in that direction.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.840
As we record now, that may not be the case.

14:38.840 --> 14:42.800
Richard Hughes, who we've talked about before on the show in the context of the firmware

14:42.800 --> 14:49.160
update project, great work over there, is one of two primary developers of Nome software.

14:49.160 --> 14:50.800
Now let that sink in for a moment.

14:50.800 --> 14:54.080
There's contributors to Nome software, but there's two primary developers and Richard

14:54.080 --> 14:58.840
Hughes is one of them, and he wrote, recently, Canonical decided that they are not going

14:58.840 --> 15:03.320
to be installing Nome software in the next LTS, preferring instead to ship a SNAP store

15:03.320 --> 15:06.500
by Canonical rather than Nome software.

15:06.500 --> 15:11.080
The new SNAP store will obviously not support flat packs or even firmwares for that matter.

15:11.080 --> 15:14.320
The developers are currently assigned to work on Nome software, have been reassigned to

15:14.320 --> 15:18.120
work on the SNAP store, and I'm not confident they'll be able to keep up both the old and

15:18.120 --> 15:19.760
new code bases.

15:19.760 --> 15:23.940
The existing SNAP plugin is not very well tested, and I do not want to be the one responsible

15:23.940 --> 15:28.200
when it breaks.

15:28.200 --> 15:34.280
The crux of it here really is that Canonical is switching to their own software store in

15:34.280 --> 15:38.600
Ubuntu LTS, the next LTS, not the version that's about to ship.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.320
That will still be using Nome software.

15:41.320 --> 15:47.280
But in the version after that, they have begun, as we record, about 20 days ago the first

15:47.280 --> 15:51.520
patches were committed, they have begun developing their own store.

15:51.520 --> 15:53.560
It hasn't been finished.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.720
It may not even end up in the LTS.

15:56.720 --> 16:02.840
The other thing that was surprising about this is the SNAP maintainer for Fedora was

16:02.840 --> 16:05.000
caught off guard completely by this.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.560
Neil writes in the comments, this is completely news to me.

16:08.560 --> 16:14.480
As far as I know, Canonical is still maintaining the SNAP plugin upstream, which is the case.

16:14.480 --> 16:19.200
And he also writes how they've been recently getting very close to full confinement support

16:19.200 --> 16:22.240
using SNAPs and SE Linux on Fedora.

16:22.240 --> 16:24.800
So we're getting really close to that as well.

16:24.800 --> 16:33.120
What reads as a bit of a snafu between Canonical and the Fedora maintainers reveals what a

16:33.120 --> 16:38.800
lot of rumors had been implying for a long time, that the Canonical developers have to

16:38.800 --> 16:43.680
really walk on eggshells around the upstream Nome and Fedora team.

16:43.680 --> 16:50.920
And that the support for SNAPs in Nome software was really kind of conditional.

16:50.920 --> 16:53.280
As long as Canonical played ball, they'd keep it.

16:53.280 --> 16:57.600
But as soon as Canonical didn't, they took that ball.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.920
I give credit to the Canonical developers who engaged in this conversation in a very

17:01.920 --> 17:04.160
rational level-headed approach.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.480
And they came to some common ground here.

17:06.480 --> 17:10.880
In fact, we even are revealed a bit of what perhaps will be the future of Flatpaks and

17:10.880 --> 17:13.560
funding Flathub developers.

17:13.560 --> 17:18.040
There's some interesting things in here, including that Nome software is already falling underneath

17:18.040 --> 17:22.360
its own weight and that they're struggling to reduce its complexity.

17:22.360 --> 17:26.520
And there's some things that the SNAP plugin developers can do to help with that.

17:26.520 --> 17:31.760
It looks like we've kind of found a happy middle ground right now.

17:31.760 --> 17:34.000
SNAP plugin support will continue.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.820
That may change in the future.

17:35.820 --> 17:42.580
But even if they were to remove plugin support, Neil could simply package it up and then the

17:42.580 --> 17:46.720
end user could just install that package and everything would be fine.

17:46.720 --> 17:50.660
Just like with the 32-bit situation that we talked about a couple of weeks ago, there's

17:50.660 --> 17:52.080
always another solution.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.040
There's always another way to solve this problem.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.840
It's never the end of the world.

17:55.840 --> 18:00.520
I think one of the problems with open source development is that everything is out of the

18:00.520 --> 18:01.520
open.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.520
And that's obviously one of its big strengths as well.

18:03.520 --> 18:09.200
But it can be its Achilles heel because in cases like this, it's just a very sort of

18:09.200 --> 18:13.120
public squabble almost is what it looks like.

18:13.120 --> 18:18.320
And I don't think there's any way to avoid that because of the open nature of the development.

18:18.320 --> 18:21.920
But it does reflect badly on everyone really when this sort of stuff happens.

18:21.920 --> 18:22.920
It is.

18:22.920 --> 18:27.640
However, in this case, we did actually see them all work it out on their own in a public

18:27.640 --> 18:30.480
forum without name calling.

18:30.480 --> 18:34.960
Really a very rational, reasonable conversation considering what was at stake.

18:34.960 --> 18:38.120
It feels like though we've just punted the issue for now.

18:38.120 --> 18:43.840
Now there is this line and when that when that new store does go live, we're going to

18:43.840 --> 18:45.260
be there again.

18:45.260 --> 18:47.120
We're going to be right back where we're at.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.460
And maybe it does make sense, right?

18:49.460 --> 18:56.200
The Gnome folks and Red Hat and the Fedora team, they're all in on flat packs.

18:56.200 --> 19:01.280
And if Canonical shipping their own store and doesn't need that support upstreamed anymore,

19:01.280 --> 19:03.600
so that way it's functional on Ubuntu.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.640
Why should they maintain their competitors product, I guess like I'm trying to think

19:07.640 --> 19:08.640
about it from their side.

19:08.640 --> 19:11.180
I can see some rationale there.

19:11.180 --> 19:14.800
It's just sort of the timing of it because the project so brand new, it may not even

19:14.800 --> 19:15.960
go anywhere.

19:15.960 --> 19:20.240
It's just so early days that it seemed it seemed seemed a little early, like the reaction

19:20.240 --> 19:21.720
was they were ready to jump.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.120
Oh, yeah, definitely.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.800
It feels like they were just looking for an excuse, really.

19:26.800 --> 19:31.480
And it's sad to see because we hoped that there would be great cooperation and that

19:31.480 --> 19:37.520
with a major distro like Ubuntu switching to Gnome that it would mean that Gnome benefited

19:37.520 --> 19:41.280
from all those extra users and all the extra development.

19:41.280 --> 19:47.000
But if we're starting to see hostility happening, then it's just not good for anyone.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
I know.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
I agree.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.240
You just you want to see the desktop be successful and and this stuff seems counterproductive

19:53.240 --> 19:54.240
to that.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.840
But I got to bring it back to the end of the day.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.420
They did work it out.

19:57.420 --> 20:00.640
For now, the cats and dogs continue to get along, Joe.

20:00.640 --> 20:04.920
Can you imagine big proprietary companies who are rivals working together on software

20:04.920 --> 20:05.920
like this?

20:05.920 --> 20:07.680
Not at all, really.

20:07.680 --> 20:09.160
And that's the nature of open source.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.480
And obviously, you're going to have a few issues here and there.

20:11.480 --> 20:16.240
But ultimately, it is much better to do it this open source way.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.400
That's a great point.

20:17.400 --> 20:23.000
And you know, props to developers on both sides of this situation who end up essentially

20:23.000 --> 20:25.160
becoming corporate ambassadors.

20:25.160 --> 20:30.180
They are dealing with interactions that could have millions of dollars worth of ramifications

20:30.180 --> 20:31.680
for either side.

20:31.680 --> 20:34.480
And it's just not even part of their job description.

20:34.480 --> 20:40.320
So regardless of however this goes, you know, tip of the hat to both sides for having to

20:40.320 --> 20:44.980
wear that extra hat when also having these technical conversations.

20:44.980 --> 20:45.980
This stuff's fascinating.

20:45.980 --> 20:48.180
It's what makes open source tick.

20:48.180 --> 20:51.560
This and all kinds of things make free software really something to follow.
