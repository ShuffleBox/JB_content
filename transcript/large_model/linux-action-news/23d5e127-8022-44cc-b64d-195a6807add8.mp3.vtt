Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.600 --> 00:21.120
This is episode 82, recorded on December 2nd, 2018.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.120
I'm Chris.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.120
And I'm Joe.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.120
Hello, Joe.

00:24.120 --> 00:30.520
I do not believe it's December already, but I can believe the news around ClearLinux.

00:30.520 --> 00:35.640
I won't spoil a prediction, but I think ClearLinux is going to turn a lot of heads, and I think

00:35.640 --> 00:37.040
they're just getting started.

00:37.040 --> 00:43.960
They caught my attention a few weeks ago when they announced KDE support, but now it seems

00:43.960 --> 00:48.520
they're trying to up the desktop effort, including a new installer and other goodies.

00:48.520 --> 00:53.440
Yeah, it's traditionally really been more for containers and, you know, cloud workloads,

00:53.440 --> 00:54.440
doesn't it?

00:54.440 --> 00:56.920
But I know that the team working on it use it as a desktop.

00:56.920 --> 00:57.920
And it used to be Xfce.

00:57.920 --> 01:04.240
They made a transition to GNOME, which no idea why they did that, but it has been used

01:04.240 --> 01:05.880
as a desktop internally.

01:05.880 --> 01:11.440
But now they're making it a bit easier to actually try out with a live image that has

01:11.440 --> 01:13.160
got an installer in it.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.120
The installer is a little bit basic, shall we say.

01:16.120 --> 01:22.320
It's kind of in Curses style, but it is actually much easier than it used to be to get going

01:22.320 --> 01:23.500
on the desktop now.

01:23.500 --> 01:27.040
You do kind of wonder, right, if this is anything to do with Aiki going back to the team.

01:27.040 --> 01:30.320
Aiki used to be the lead developer for Solus.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.880
Now he's back working in Intel, working on ClearLinux.

01:33.880 --> 01:39.480
And here we see initiatives focused at the desktop, which was a line of work that Aiki

01:39.480 --> 01:42.000
was in when he was working on Solus.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.560
It seems like it's a possible connection to me.

01:44.560 --> 01:45.560
I don't know about that.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.000
This seems like the kind of thing that they must have been working on for a little while,

01:49.000 --> 01:50.920
and he's only just rejoined that team, hasn't he?

01:50.920 --> 01:54.080
So maybe he's had an influence there.

01:54.080 --> 01:59.040
But you're right about it being one to watch, ClearLinux.

01:59.040 --> 02:04.420
Because if you look at the Ferronix benchmarks, you know, Michael loves doing his benchmarks

02:04.420 --> 02:05.880
over at Ferronix.

02:05.880 --> 02:11.680
And ClearLinux seems to be up there, if not winning, almost every time, doesn't it?

02:11.680 --> 02:17.240
Whether it's boot times or performance or whatever, it is a seriously solid distro.

02:17.240 --> 02:21.640
But it just doesn't seem to get much attention, because I suppose it's not been that easy

02:21.640 --> 02:22.640
to install.

02:22.640 --> 02:25.520
But now it's a little bit easier.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.520
Maybe it will.

02:26.520 --> 02:27.520
Yeah.

02:27.520 --> 02:31.960
What I'm kind of getting at is it has that vibe to it that some projects get sometimes.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.200
When you can see there's a lot of potential.

02:34.200 --> 02:38.880
There's a clear industry sponsor behind it, Intel, that has a motivation for continuing

02:38.880 --> 02:40.880
to work on the project.

02:40.880 --> 02:44.240
And there is the groundwork for it to go big.

02:44.240 --> 02:49.520
And I hear so many complimentary things from the audience about ClearLinux anytime we talk

02:49.520 --> 02:51.000
about it.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.760
And when I go through the screenshots that Michael's dutifully put in the article that

02:54.760 --> 03:00.760
we'll link at linuxactionnews.com slash 82, what I see here is something that is early

03:00.760 --> 03:03.240
days but competent and ready to use.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.240
It's NCURSUS-based.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.400
You know, it's text-based.

03:05.400 --> 03:09.120
But you go through, you select your package groups, you use their new partitioning tool,

03:09.120 --> 03:11.960
which this is one of the new big features.

03:11.960 --> 03:15.080
To your point, Joe, I think they have been working on this for a while.

03:15.080 --> 03:17.280
That's one of those things they've been working on for a while.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.280
It's all in there.

03:18.280 --> 03:22.360
If you've ever installed a Linux distribution before, you're going to be able to do this,

03:22.360 --> 03:24.820
even if you're not a command line pro.

03:24.820 --> 03:29.680
And that's just one little rough edge that over time they could make even nicer.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.640
They could replace that with a graphical installer.

03:32.640 --> 03:38.280
And they're introducing features like this desktop live image that clearly is trying

03:38.280 --> 03:39.520
to make it more accessible.

03:39.520 --> 03:44.000
Well, it sounds to me like you and Wes should have a look at this, install it on some hardware

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
and talk about it a lot.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Yeah.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.760
I think it'll be coming to Linux Unplugged soon.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.280
Will it work as a desktop?

03:50.280 --> 03:52.560
That's something I'm willing to give that a go for a little bit.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.040
I'll report my findings.

03:54.040 --> 03:58.840
Well, my pro tip for you is don't try and install it on a legacy boot machine because

03:58.840 --> 04:03.720
it needs EFI boot, by the looks of things, from my testing of it.

04:03.720 --> 04:04.720
You know what?

04:04.720 --> 04:06.000
Coming from Intel, that doesn't surprise me.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Yeah, exactly.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
I think the clear Linux boot manager is supposed to be one of the things that's pretty great

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
about it.

04:11.000 --> 04:17.280
Obviously, Intel want everyone to move over to proper EFI boot, but they'll take my legacy

04:17.280 --> 04:20.360
boot from my cold dead hands, I'm afraid.

04:20.360 --> 04:24.520
I've managed to build a system before they made that change, so hopefully I'll get four

04:24.520 --> 04:27.540
or five years out of this and then just suck it up afterwards.

04:27.540 --> 04:28.540
You know what, Joey?

04:28.540 --> 04:30.240
It's not so bad.

04:30.240 --> 04:34.080
I've just had to bite the bullet with my more recent systems, and it's not so bad.

04:34.080 --> 04:36.380
In fact, they boot up a little faster.

04:36.380 --> 04:37.380
It's actually kind of nice.

04:37.380 --> 04:41.080
Yeah, but I don't like all those extra partitions.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.520
You are old school.

04:42.520 --> 04:44.720
Yeah, you and your XFCE.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.400
I do actually kind of agree with you there.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.360
I don't like it either, but I've just learned to live with it.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.440
I just go crazy now with my partitioning.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.440
Yeah.

04:52.440 --> 04:57.480
So, speaking of Linux Unplugged then, you had Matthew Miller on last week talking about

04:57.480 --> 05:03.720
Fedora 31 and how that is fairly likely to be delayed by six months.

05:03.720 --> 05:09.000
Yeah, a proposal that they have out there right now is to say, let's essentially skip

05:09.000 --> 05:16.640
the 31 release cycle and spend that time retooling the distribution, reorganizing parts of how

05:16.640 --> 05:21.880
we do the release, and fixing some of the tools that have really grown over the years

05:21.880 --> 05:27.080
and make it hard to just spin off one particular edition of Fedora or something like that.

05:27.080 --> 05:31.080
And the timing is precarious for multiple reasons.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.280
Yeah, this is IBM coming along and ruining it already.

05:34.280 --> 05:38.040
Yeah, before the thing's even complete, they're already...

05:38.040 --> 05:41.280
Yeah, the deal hasn't actually gone through and they're already, no, this has nothing

05:41.280 --> 05:42.280
to do with that.

05:42.280 --> 05:43.280
You think?

05:43.280 --> 05:44.280
Well...

05:44.280 --> 05:45.280
I don't know.

05:45.280 --> 05:49.920
I mean, the timing is...it does mean that by the time the next Fedora would be released,

05:49.920 --> 05:51.680
the acquisition would be final.

05:51.680 --> 05:54.600
I honestly don't think that that has got much to do with it.

05:54.600 --> 05:59.760
I think this has been looming for a very long time because you only have to listen to what

05:59.760 --> 06:04.880
Matthew said to you on Linux Unplugged, and you can hear that they've been collecting

06:04.880 --> 06:10.960
this technical debt for so long, and it's taken them just a day to put the distro together,

06:10.960 --> 06:15.040
not even build the packages, just kind of compose, he calls it, where they pull all

06:15.040 --> 06:20.080
the packages together and make the image and everything, and that's just unsustainable.

06:20.080 --> 06:25.960
They want to get that down to just a few hours, and it sounds like they just need to get their

06:25.960 --> 06:32.440
technical house in order, and maybe the IBM thing has got a slight influence over this,

06:32.440 --> 06:37.040
but I like to think that it's far more technical in nature and much less political.

06:37.040 --> 06:41.640
Something else that Matthew said was that this is really in service of a larger objective

06:41.640 --> 06:46.600
they set a while ago, and this is one of the ways they think they can accomplish that as

06:46.600 --> 06:47.720
a project.

06:47.720 --> 06:52.920
The timing is also just precarious because Gnome Shell is in a rapid state of improvement

06:52.920 --> 07:01.440
right now, and to miss a release cycle of Gnome Shell is tricky for a distribution that's

07:01.440 --> 07:03.520
supposed to be the Gnome Shell showcase.

07:03.520 --> 07:08.880
I think they're going to have to solve that problem, maybe either via modularity in the

07:08.880 --> 07:15.120
software repository, flat packs, snaps, I don't know how they're going to solve it,

07:15.120 --> 07:17.520
but wouldn't that be something?

07:17.520 --> 07:21.560
Just for a laugh, canonical out of a rush to get the Gnome 3 desktop all snapped up

07:21.560 --> 07:26.080
and then Fedora users could give it a go.

07:26.080 --> 07:31.120
I don't know, it's a precarious time, but I'll tell you my first reaction before I talked

07:31.120 --> 07:38.960
to Matthew was personally kind of just a little negative because I have this bias as a longtime

07:38.960 --> 07:46.040
sysadmin from days back that developers will often try to have, they'll get stuck, they'll

07:46.040 --> 07:50.760
get stuck on a really hard problem and they'll start obsessing over their tools.

07:50.760 --> 07:56.560
What editor they're using, what their laptop, the monitor layout, all of it, they'll just

07:56.560 --> 08:01.400
start going at it and open source developers do this too and a lot of times they'll stop

08:01.400 --> 08:05.600
and they'll decide, you know what, it's time to break this into a modular architecture

08:05.600 --> 08:10.120
with a client server architecture or we need to rebuild our infrastructure or we can't

08:10.120 --> 08:14.200
really complete this project until we have this new bug tracker in place.

08:14.200 --> 08:18.380
As an open source consumer, it often feels like progress will all of a sudden halt on

08:18.380 --> 08:26.120
your favorite project while the project does like some sort of self-analysis and self-correction

08:26.120 --> 08:33.920
that ultimately is in service for the consumer, but as a consumer feels like it's sort of

08:33.920 --> 08:36.600
seems like navel gazing from the project standpoint.

08:36.600 --> 08:40.680
And so that was my initial reaction was, oh no, we're going to get caught in another one

08:40.680 --> 08:45.640
of these tool spirals, but it was pretty clearly outlined in a problems document that they

08:45.640 --> 08:50.800
have on their Wiki that they're trying to solve and there is some serious technical

08:50.800 --> 08:56.480
debt in there and when I read through that and after I talked to Matthew, I kind of feel

08:56.480 --> 09:01.160
like it'd be good for the project, not only because they could solve some of these issues,

09:01.160 --> 09:05.480
but according to their own data, the last time they did this, when they switched to

09:05.480 --> 09:10.140
additions of Fedora back in like the 2021 release era, that became one of their most

09:10.140 --> 09:14.800
popular releases ever because people could run it for a year and they had batches and

09:14.800 --> 09:18.060
they loved it and they built servers on it and products on it.

09:18.060 --> 09:21.280
So Fedora 30 may end up being the most popular Fedora release ever.

09:21.280 --> 09:27.680
Well, it would make me more likely to use it if you had that extra support and it seems

09:27.680 --> 09:31.880
that I'm not alone in thinking that because there was a proposal on the mailing list to

09:31.880 --> 09:38.840
kind of offshoot from the discussion of whether or not to delay 31 and that was a discussion

09:38.840 --> 09:43.400
about well, why don't we just move to an annual release cycle rather than every six months

09:43.400 --> 09:49.920
and for me, that seems like a brilliant splitting of the difference between Fedora as it stands

09:49.920 --> 09:52.720
now and the Ubuntu LTSs.

09:52.720 --> 09:53.920
I kind of like the idea.

09:53.920 --> 09:57.440
I do kind of like it and I kind of like where you're going with it too because you don't

09:57.440 --> 10:01.340
need to solve the problems the same way we've always solved them.

10:01.340 --> 10:05.800
There's lots of new ways to solve those problems, including software modularity and Flatpak.

10:05.800 --> 10:11.480
I mean, I know I just made a joke about those, but you could just Flatpak up Gnome Shell

10:11.480 --> 10:17.200
and deliver Gnome Shell as Flatpaks and have that on top of a stable Fedora 30 release

10:17.200 --> 10:22.320
or 31 release, especially if they go to a longer cadence and if modularity would allow

10:22.320 --> 10:27.960
me to get deeper user land or maybe even kernel repositories that are from newer versions

10:27.960 --> 10:32.880
or maybe even rawhide, we could really be talking business here.

10:32.880 --> 10:37.180
Now, as much as you and I might think this would be pretty great, this is probably not

10:37.180 --> 10:38.180
going anywhere.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.040
It's not even formally drafted as an actual proposal.

10:40.040 --> 10:43.600
It was really just kind of a discussion that kicked off on the mailing list.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.560
But I guess I do see why there is a fair amount of pushback.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.800
It would really change the way they've been doing things for a long time.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.900
I guess if I was going to see this go any way there, I would kind of like to see it

10:52.900 --> 11:00.440
go the other direction instead of like these big old static yearly dumps.

11:00.440 --> 11:05.120
Why not something a little more closer to rolling and this is Fedora we're talking about

11:05.120 --> 11:06.120
here.

11:06.120 --> 11:09.080
Now, I know like rawhide is not really in a suitable state to do this with, but what

11:09.080 --> 11:16.960
if it was kind of something closer to KDE neon and it was a pretty stable Fedora base

11:16.960 --> 11:23.780
that didn't change much, new kernels and you got fresh user land stuff and then they would

11:23.780 --> 11:28.400
maybe rev the base, which would be the core, which would be what the cloud and server editions

11:28.400 --> 11:29.580
are based off of.

11:29.580 --> 11:30.580
You do that.

11:30.580 --> 11:32.160
That's the part you can rev once a year.

11:32.160 --> 11:36.600
And they've got DNF, the upgrade process down so great that if you're not having to worry

11:36.600 --> 11:40.800
about having to upgrade all your user land and your lower level stuff at the same time,

11:40.800 --> 11:43.600
it's going to be a lot cleaner, a lot simpler.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.320
That is a Fedora workstation I could kind of get excited about.

11:46.320 --> 11:50.840
I think you might be dreaming there because even though Fedora is known for being sort

11:50.840 --> 11:56.840
of cutting edge and everything, it's a major change you're talking about there that would

11:56.840 --> 12:02.300
take a lot of planning and if they're in the middle of retooling the entire build process

12:02.300 --> 12:06.920
and everything, that is just a bridge too far I think right now.

12:06.920 --> 12:11.840
Maybe in a few years they could think about something like that, but again, Fedora seems

12:11.840 --> 12:15.240
to be working quite well as it is on a six monthly cycle.

12:15.240 --> 12:19.280
It's not really for me, but I think that it has its target audience as it is.

12:19.280 --> 12:23.280
And now with the modularity, I don't think you need to push that as far as you're talking

12:23.280 --> 12:29.680
about to make it useful and it just doesn't feel broken so it doesn't need to be fixed

12:29.680 --> 12:30.680
to me.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.960
I see what you're saying, I just think it's going to be, again, it's just what I started

12:33.960 --> 12:35.260
this thing with.

12:35.260 --> 12:39.160
It's a tricky time to be doing this because you've got CentOS out there that's also free,

12:39.160 --> 12:41.840
it's going to be based on RHEL 8 when that ships.

12:41.840 --> 12:45.960
You could flat pack and modular the crap out of that and make yourself a pretty nice up

12:45.960 --> 12:50.600
to date workstation that has like 10 years of support.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.920
And I'm just wondering like where's Fedora going to fit in this future in a couple of

12:53.920 --> 13:01.240
years if they don't do something interesting and different, I could see a world where I'm

13:01.240 --> 13:07.020
sitting here on a ThinkPad running CentOS 8 subscribed to the latest GNOME and user

13:07.020 --> 13:10.900
land applications and I'm pretty happy and I don't really change it.

13:10.900 --> 13:13.080
That could be a future for me.

13:13.080 --> 13:18.000
It's a long shot, but it may be more likely than this being a Fedora workstation anytime

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
soon.

13:19.000 --> 13:24.160
Would Red Hat slash IBM care, probably not.

13:24.160 --> 13:27.440
Everybody seems to want that developer market, that Sputnik market.

13:27.440 --> 13:33.360
You know, the XPS Sputnik effort just hit their six year anniversary and I think it

13:33.360 --> 13:38.760
took a while, but just about the entire industry has recognized what they're doing over there

13:38.760 --> 13:39.760
at Dell.

13:39.760 --> 13:43.320
I mean, you've got Microsoft now shipping the Windows subsystem for Linux, Google has

13:43.320 --> 13:50.320
built in Linux into Chrome, including full GUI applications as well as terminals.

13:50.320 --> 13:56.080
And next Tuesday on Linux Unplugged, I'm going to have a chat with the ISH developer-ish.

13:56.080 --> 14:03.800
It is a Linux user land for iOS, a full-fledged Alpine Linux environment with a package manager,

14:03.800 --> 14:10.160
tools like YouTube DL and ping and traceroute, all on iOS.

14:10.160 --> 14:13.040
And this isn't just out of nowhere.

14:13.040 --> 14:17.600
It's because there is a market for this stuff, for the Sputniks, for the machines running

14:17.600 --> 14:18.600
Linux.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.680
There's a market for it.

14:19.680 --> 14:21.120
It's just a particular kind of market.

14:21.120 --> 14:26.840
And if IBM had any sense at all anymore, they'd be going after that market because those are

14:26.840 --> 14:31.280
the individuals that are building applications for that hybrid cloud that they want to own.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.280
Yeah.

14:32.280 --> 14:36.680
I've actually tried out that ISH thing on an iPad that I borrowed and it is rock solid.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.760
So yeah, look forward to listening to that.

14:38.760 --> 14:39.760
Yeah.

14:39.760 --> 14:40.920
I just had to, I was like, I had to find out.

14:40.920 --> 14:47.960
Like was he a diehard Apple user trying to dabble in Linux or was he a diehard Linux

14:47.960 --> 14:50.120
user trying to get it on iOS?

14:50.120 --> 14:52.680
So I had to call him up and I had a chat with him.

14:52.680 --> 14:53.680
I already recorded it.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.320
So I'm just going to put it in the next episode of Linux Unplugged.

14:56.320 --> 14:57.320
All right.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.320
Well, you mentioned Google there.

14:58.320 --> 15:02.020
And one thing that they have been pushing for the last few years is AMP, accelerated

15:02.020 --> 15:03.880
mobile pages.

15:03.880 --> 15:09.080
And we reported on this a couple of months ago that they were looking to go for a new

15:09.080 --> 15:12.760
governance model, which would mean that they weren't as in charge of it and they'd make

15:12.760 --> 15:14.280
it more of a community effort.

15:14.280 --> 15:20.160
Well, that has now happened and there are now a lot of companies involved in this officially.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.160
Yes.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.160
Yes.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.160
This is good.

15:23.160 --> 15:28.640
I mean, the two key features we're seeing really become established is the governance

15:28.640 --> 15:32.000
models, the technical steering committee and the advisory committee.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.480
So you have the TSC and the AC and these are the committees that Joe's talking about that

15:37.480 --> 15:46.240
are pretty well-established companies, ACMI, CloudFlare, Washington Post, Vox Media, several

15:46.240 --> 15:49.560
Google employees, eBay, 1-800-Flowers, it goes on.

15:49.560 --> 15:54.680
The list, the technical steering committee has more Google members, has three Google

15:54.680 --> 15:58.320
members and then a few other from the rest of the industry like Microsoft and Twitter

15:58.320 --> 16:00.320
and Pinterest.

16:00.320 --> 16:04.640
However, I really don't get a sense of this is really much more independent from Google.

16:04.640 --> 16:08.100
In fact, when you look at the people that are organizing all of this and the people

16:08.100 --> 16:12.320
that are sort of organizing those committees and that are sort of at the top, they're all

16:12.320 --> 16:13.320
Google.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.320
It's all Google.

16:14.320 --> 16:19.440
I mean, I understand and appreciate that this is their baby and it's just moved out and

16:19.440 --> 16:22.880
it just got its first apartment and I'm sitting here going like, well, but your folks are

16:22.880 --> 16:25.280
still paying for your car insurance, like what the hell, kid?

16:25.280 --> 16:28.660
Like I get it, but we're not there yet, right?

16:28.660 --> 16:30.360
This is still early days.

16:30.360 --> 16:35.040
Well, the cynical person would say that they're just paying lip service to the complaints

16:35.040 --> 16:40.160
that the community had and that this is really just a bone doggle.

16:40.160 --> 16:47.000
It's not really them making any serious changes, whereas the optimist might say that it is

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
a good first step.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.600
It's a very solid first step and it shows that they are serious about bringing the community

16:52.600 --> 16:58.500
into this thing and that that community involvement will expand over time and Google's grip on

16:58.500 --> 17:03.560
it will get lighter and lighter until they are just one of many companies involved in

17:03.560 --> 17:04.560
it.

17:04.560 --> 17:08.920
I think the reality is probably somewhere in between those two, but I probably lean

17:08.920 --> 17:11.040
a little bit more on the first one, to be honest.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.580
I'll give Google this.

17:12.580 --> 17:16.520
This is a good effort and this is a little bit of a different tact than they normally

17:16.520 --> 17:18.840
take with their open source projects.

17:18.840 --> 17:25.240
I think this is going to serve them well and if it is successful and it perhaps gets more

17:25.240 --> 17:29.840
adoption in the industry, I think Google's going to be happy with this and they'll probably,

17:29.840 --> 17:32.800
like you say, let it essentially be run by the industry.

17:32.800 --> 17:37.940
I think if it's a failure and it really doesn't get them any more traction, they'll pivot.

17:37.940 --> 17:40.640
If this goes nowhere, I don't think Google's done with AMP.

17:40.640 --> 17:41.640
Oh yeah.

17:41.640 --> 17:42.920
Well, it's been very successful for them.

17:42.920 --> 17:47.840
If you do virtually any Google search on a phone, you're going to hit an AMP page as

17:47.840 --> 17:48.840
one of the first results.

17:48.840 --> 17:49.840
Yeah.

17:49.840 --> 17:52.140
And for the most part, it's kind of a good end user experience.

17:52.140 --> 17:53.240
That's the worst thing about it.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.760
It's like when I use it, I'm like, oh, that's not bad.

17:55.760 --> 17:56.760
Yeah.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.200
There are some problems with it, but generally speaking, it is faster.

17:59.200 --> 18:02.000
And if you're on mobile data, then it's just a no brainer really.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.000
Yeah.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.040
Well, like we always say, I suppose we'll see where this one goes.

18:05.040 --> 18:09.240
But chances are, if you are on an Asino mobile phone, AMP's going to work for you.

18:09.240 --> 18:10.240
A what?

18:10.240 --> 18:11.240
An Asino what, Joe?

18:11.240 --> 18:12.240
Yeah.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.240
Is it Asino?

18:13.240 --> 18:14.240
Is it Nikuno?

18:14.240 --> 18:15.240
I don't know.

18:15.240 --> 18:16.240
Yeah.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.240
Don't ask me.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.240
Yeah.

18:18.240 --> 18:23.000
Either way, it's a phone that has been announced and I suppose almost pre-announced really

18:23.000 --> 18:24.560
if that's even a thing.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.800
And it's going to be running Plasma Mobile.

18:26.800 --> 18:30.280
And that's pretty much all we know about it apart from some of the hardware specs, which

18:30.280 --> 18:35.600
are modest, shall we say, but positive in the freedom dimension.

18:35.600 --> 18:40.240
I'm not familiar with this vendor, and I'm not particularly excited about this hardware.

18:40.240 --> 18:44.320
But this does seem like a good feather in the cap for the Plasma Mobile project, which

18:44.320 --> 18:48.280
I think has had this really great rational approach to building for mobile for a while

18:48.280 --> 18:49.280
now.

18:49.280 --> 18:53.240
So maybe this will be the hardware, but it's getting there.

18:53.240 --> 18:57.480
Every time they have a shot on real hardware, they have a chance to try it out in production,

18:57.480 --> 18:59.760
in the real world, work out bugs.

18:59.760 --> 19:00.760
It's good for the project.

19:00.760 --> 19:01.760
Yeah.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.120
And I mentioned it's positive in the freedom dimension.

19:04.120 --> 19:12.120
And that's because it's got this IMX 6 CPU with the Vivante GPU, which doesn't require

19:12.120 --> 19:13.120
blobs.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.920
You do need blobs to get LTE working.

19:15.920 --> 19:19.060
And so that's why we're not going to see that straight away.

19:19.060 --> 19:25.000
But this is kind of like what Purism are trying to do, but a little bit less ambitious, and

19:25.000 --> 19:29.800
therefore probably a little bit more likely to happen.

19:29.800 --> 19:35.540
So I'm not massively excited about it, because it's not going to be this flagship, super

19:35.540 --> 19:38.760
performant device with convergence and everything.

19:38.760 --> 19:43.200
But I think there is a market for a freedom-respecting phone.

19:43.200 --> 19:48.940
And I think that people will put up with lower specs as long as it works reasonably well.

19:48.940 --> 19:53.040
Now the problem that we have with this is it's all a bit vague at this point.

19:53.040 --> 19:57.360
I said pre-announced, which is kind of a nonsense term, but that's almost what we've got here.

19:57.360 --> 20:01.880
Because we don't really know what Plasma Mobile is going to be running on top of, because

20:01.880 --> 20:02.880
that's just an interface.

20:02.880 --> 20:04.600
So we don't know, is it going to be Debian?

20:04.600 --> 20:05.600
Is it going to be?

20:05.600 --> 20:06.600
Who knows?

20:06.600 --> 20:10.420
It's going to be some sort of Linux, and probably some sort of GNU slash Linux.

20:10.420 --> 20:15.600
But it's very early days, so we just don't know really.

20:15.600 --> 20:21.360
But it's building a bit more hype and getting a bit more interest in Plasma Mobile, which

20:21.360 --> 20:26.560
we thought we were going to have as a kind of first-class citizen on the Purism phone,

20:26.560 --> 20:27.560
the Librem 5.

20:27.560 --> 20:32.120
But now that's looking increasingly less likely, and it's going to be all about the GNOME shell

20:32.120 --> 20:33.480
on there.

20:33.480 --> 20:37.760
So I think anything that shines a light on Plasma Mobile is good.

20:37.760 --> 20:42.160
But I spoke to Jonathan Riddle about this, and he didn't know too much about it.

20:42.160 --> 20:48.920
And apparently, Nikuno, Nisuno, whatever, are not really putting many resources into

20:48.920 --> 20:54.040
it in terms of KDE, apart from giving the project some phones to hack on and stuff.

20:54.040 --> 20:59.040
So it's not like a major undertaking for them.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.480
But who knows?

21:01.480 --> 21:06.040
It feels like we're clutching at straws, doesn't it, with proper Linux on mobile at this point.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.000
But I just hope that we're wrong about that.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.600
I don't think there is a market for it.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.760
You say there's a market for it.

21:11.760 --> 21:12.760
I don't think there is.

21:12.760 --> 21:19.240
I mean, I guess it define, unless you want to define market as 200,000, 300,000 units

21:19.240 --> 21:20.240
a year.

21:20.240 --> 21:23.400
Well, if I could make a phone and sell 200,000 or 300,000 units, I'd be quite happy.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.160
But nobody can, right?

21:25.160 --> 21:27.000
That's the problem, is no one can.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.760
To make a phone that is actually the quality of a phone, you have to have scale of manufacturing.

21:31.760 --> 21:32.760
Yeah, true.

21:32.760 --> 21:36.120
And that's just even to get something that has halfway decent battery life and can make

21:36.120 --> 21:40.440
a phone call in the US, let alone anywhere else in the world.

21:40.440 --> 21:46.720
The thing is, is this is why I like projects like Ubiports and like Plasma Mobile, because

21:46.720 --> 21:52.960
I don't think there's enough market for one phone to sell so many copies that now all

21:52.960 --> 21:57.400
of a sudden one of these projects is funded and can develop a great free operating system

21:57.400 --> 21:58.400
for mobile.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.400
It's just never going to happen.

21:59.400 --> 22:04.000
They're not going to sell tens of millions, probably wouldn't have to sell.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.520
It's just not going to happen.

22:05.520 --> 22:14.480
But there is a deep, deep market of used devices and even newer devices and there will be market

22:14.480 --> 22:19.760
competitors that we haven't seen yet that have more flexibility that can be introduced.

22:19.760 --> 22:24.040
And these will be perfect candidates for these types of projects.

22:24.040 --> 22:30.220
I can't see anyone who's going to be successful in trying to sell a phone to the free software

22:30.220 --> 22:32.520
crowd and be sustainable.

22:32.520 --> 22:37.760
I mean, if that was the case, then these Lenovo's that are out there, you say they don't care

22:37.760 --> 22:41.120
about specs, but if that was the case, then these Lenovo's out there that are reflashing

22:41.120 --> 22:45.040
them with all free software would be selling like hotcakes.

22:45.040 --> 22:48.520
I think they sell them in small batches at best.

22:48.520 --> 22:52.120
If they get lucky, maybe they sell it to an organization or a school, but that's got to

22:52.120 --> 22:53.640
be their rare sale.

22:53.640 --> 22:59.720
It's really kind of the market's spoken, like they've decided and it's not a product that

22:59.720 --> 23:00.720
they want.

23:00.720 --> 23:03.440
See, I'm not saying this is a good thing, I'm just saying it's the reality.

23:03.440 --> 23:05.000
Yeah, well tell that to Purism.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
I think it just did.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.960
All right, we better move on then.

23:09.960 --> 23:13.760
And this is definitely good news and there's no way that you can be cynical about this.

23:13.760 --> 23:18.800
The Linux Foundation and the RISC-V Foundation have announced a joint collaboration.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.760
The RISC-V Foundation is no slouch either.

23:20.760 --> 23:27.080
It has 210 institutional academic and individual members from all around the world.

23:27.080 --> 23:30.400
And this is any way you look at it, got to be a good thing if it means we're going to

23:30.400 --> 23:33.080
get some RISC-V devices.

23:33.080 --> 23:39.040
I don't know why I should care, to be honest with you, other than I think RISC-V is a good

23:39.040 --> 23:40.040
thing.

23:40.040 --> 23:41.040
Go RISC.

23:41.040 --> 23:42.040
You know what I mean?

23:42.040 --> 23:43.040
Well, kind of.

23:43.040 --> 23:47.440
I think you should care because it adds legitimacy to RISC-V.

23:47.440 --> 23:48.440
Fair enough.

23:48.440 --> 23:53.720
I guess if I didn't mean to sound like it didn't, I mean, I just care because I want

23:53.720 --> 23:57.200
RISC to be successful and I want them to have more legitimacy.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.560
But it's hard when you start talking about these bureaucratic layers joining up, it's

24:00.560 --> 24:02.880
kind of like, I don't really know what this means.

24:02.880 --> 24:06.720
Does this mean maybe more hardware providers will get interested?

24:06.720 --> 24:07.720
I don't know what it means.

24:07.720 --> 24:08.720
I don't know why to care.

24:08.720 --> 24:16.880
Well, the Linux Foundation are good at the money side of things, let's just say.

24:16.880 --> 24:23.160
And that has to be good because it potentially means that they could use their connections

24:23.160 --> 24:30.720
within the industry to push RISC-V and push more openness, therefore, and push it back

24:30.720 --> 24:35.560
against x86 and ARM, which is locked down and uses loads of blobs.

24:35.560 --> 24:40.600
Well, I contacted someone at the Linux Foundation who works there and asked them about this

24:40.600 --> 24:43.520
because I know they're a big RISC-V fan.

24:43.520 --> 24:47.560
And she told me that it is also going to be a part governance thing as well.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.000
And I don't know what that means.

24:49.000 --> 24:54.320
But there's apparently maybe some community outreach and get togethers.

24:54.320 --> 24:58.320
Maybe that's working with hardware partners and managing that process.

24:58.320 --> 25:01.640
So the Linux Foundation is kind of known for doing that as well.

25:01.640 --> 25:06.600
So again, you can see where there is some nice overlap where RISC-V needed some help,

25:06.600 --> 25:10.500
the Foundation, and the Linux Foundation is set up to offer it.

25:10.500 --> 25:12.160
I hope this accelerates everything.

25:12.160 --> 25:13.480
Yeah, so do I.

25:13.480 --> 25:18.160
And time will tell, but I've got a feeling that it will be good ultimately.

25:18.160 --> 25:24.560
So let's end with, for me, the highlight of the Amazon event, reiInvent, that they had

25:24.560 --> 25:26.400
going on this week.

25:26.400 --> 25:29.040
And you talked about this on TechSnap last week.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.400
So I don't think we need to go into too much detail.

25:31.400 --> 25:36.680
But Firecracker, the mini VMs, I think this is going to be huge.

25:36.680 --> 25:40.400
I think all the buzz is around two main things about Firecracker.

25:40.400 --> 25:45.520
Essentially, it's KVM-based VMs, but with the low overhead of a container.

25:45.520 --> 25:48.480
So you're kind of getting your cake, and you're kind of getting to eat it too.

25:48.480 --> 25:54.880
Plus, the second thing is, it's a proper open source project up on GitHub, and Amazon seems

25:54.880 --> 25:58.880
to be keen, although we'll see, but seems to be keen on working with the community to

25:58.880 --> 25:59.880
extend it.

25:59.880 --> 26:06.100
Now, the hot sauce of this particular meal is that a lot of the hard work that takes

26:06.100 --> 26:13.700
up resources and time is being done in a jailed process outside the VM.

26:13.700 --> 26:19.740
It does that work outside, and then it fires up what they're calling a micro VM on top

26:19.740 --> 26:23.900
of the Linux KVM system, which is a great virtualizer.

26:23.900 --> 26:31.440
And now you can have VMs spun up in like 155-ish milliseconds, a fraction of a second, which

26:31.440 --> 26:34.420
is one of the major advantage to containers.

26:34.420 --> 26:38.840
And when you start looking at servers like AWS Lambda, which is a serverless service,

26:38.840 --> 26:42.520
which is ironic because, of course, behind the scenes, you're spinning up servers.

26:42.520 --> 26:45.960
But it's serverless.

26:45.960 --> 26:51.040
And the way they're executing those processes is with Firecracker now, actually put into

26:51.040 --> 26:54.760
production early, before they announced it, in Lambda.

26:54.760 --> 27:00.720
And they're able to spin up these VMs in seconds, or less than seconds, in fractions of seconds,

27:00.720 --> 27:04.400
and have the full isolation that a VM provides.

27:04.400 --> 27:08.280
One of the things that's going to make this massively successful is just the speed of

27:08.280 --> 27:09.280
it.

27:09.280 --> 27:14.880
They're able to spin up 150 user space applications per second per host.

27:14.880 --> 27:18.080
I mean, that is some serious stuff.

27:18.080 --> 27:19.320
And that's just today, right?

27:19.320 --> 27:22.360
That's early version on today's hardware.

27:22.360 --> 27:27.320
You take the project out a few years on even faster hardware, and some of the custom hardware

27:27.320 --> 27:31.780
that Amazon's working on right now, this is all x86-based, but they stated they're open

27:31.780 --> 27:34.560
to porting it to other architectures, and it's an open source project.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.640
This could be going places.

27:36.640 --> 27:41.060
This could be like the next Docker, could also just be something that's really only

27:41.060 --> 27:42.700
used at Amazon.

27:42.700 --> 27:43.700
Only time will tell, Joe.

27:43.700 --> 27:44.700
Ha ha.

27:44.700 --> 27:48.760
We need to have like a jingle for like, let's wait and see, because that's what's so often

27:48.760 --> 27:50.880
the case in these big open source projects.

27:50.880 --> 27:51.880
Yeah.

27:51.880 --> 27:54.480
I think that it will take off because they've open sourced it.

27:54.480 --> 27:57.720
They've not done their usual of just using loads of open source stuff.

27:57.720 --> 27:59.240
They've actually created it this time.

27:59.240 --> 28:03.480
And I think that it will spread out there, because at least from the sounds of things,

28:03.480 --> 28:11.320
it is technically absolutely excellent and seems to be servicing that niche between VMs

28:11.320 --> 28:12.440
and containers.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.120
And I think people are going to be all over this.

28:14.120 --> 28:17.920
So I expect to see over the next couple of years, especially as they add support for

28:17.920 --> 28:22.120
ARM, I think it's just going to be massive.

28:22.120 --> 28:28.280
You know what Wes told me, not to spoil TechSnap 391, but there's one bit in there, it's not

28:28.280 --> 28:32.080
one of the key bits, that he told me that actually kind of blew my mind.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.260
This whole project really came out of Chrome OS.

28:35.260 --> 28:40.320
This was the virtual monitor for Chrome OS that they've extended to do this, which is,

28:40.320 --> 28:43.320
I don't know why that just tickles me a lot.

28:43.320 --> 28:46.960
Yeah, Google and Amazon working together.

28:46.960 --> 28:48.600
Who would have thought it?

28:48.600 --> 28:54.880
Well, in a weird way, like they've given their cloud competitor, like perhaps its next best

28:54.880 --> 28:55.960
weapon.

28:55.960 --> 29:01.920
And they took it from a OS that was designed to supply a web browser as a desktop.

29:01.920 --> 29:05.560
And the whole thing's just, I just, I love free software and open source, this stuff's

29:05.560 --> 29:06.560
so great.

29:06.560 --> 29:08.280
You can't make it up, right?

29:08.280 --> 29:09.280
Yep.

29:09.280 --> 29:14.440
