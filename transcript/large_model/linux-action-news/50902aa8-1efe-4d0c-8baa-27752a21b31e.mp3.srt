00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,380
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 156, recorded on September 27th, 2020.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,380
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,380
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,380
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,380
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,960
Let's start this week with the big news from Lenovo for Ubuntu users.

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,300
What Canonical says is 30 Lenovo ThinkPad and ThinkStation machines, and looking down

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:30,320
the list, it's all of the ThinkPads that I can think of, the P series, the X series,

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,680
the T series, and also the desktops as well.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,840
So this is a good chunk of machines from Lenovo, pre-installed with Ubuntu 20.04.

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,520
Yeah, it's not just laptops.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,080
It's also the ThinkStations, the ThinkPad P series plus 14 additional ThinkPad T, X

13
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,400
and X1 and L series models.

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,080
But what is also notable is this is really building on a program that was internal to

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,520
Lenovo but difficult for consumers to get access to.

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,060
You had to go through a business rep, et cetera, and was only still even more limited devices.

17
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,040
But now they seem to be widening this up.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,920
In fact, there's a quote from Lenovo's vice president of PCSD software and cloud.

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,600
And it reads, our goal is to remove the complexity and provide the Linux community with the premium

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,480
experience that our customers know us for.

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,560
This is why we have taken the next step to offer Linux ready devices right out of the

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,560
box.

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,320
And of course, this follows on from the recent Fedora machines that Lenovo announced.

24
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,200
So now you've got a choice of Fedora or Ubuntu pre-installed, which is pretty cool.

25
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
Right.

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,720
Now, not all of the devices are available yet.

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,360
And I think that's probably true for the Fedora side of things as well still.

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,880
But this is a global rollout that will continue through 2020 and phases of 2021 even.

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,720
And this is excellent news for the Linux desktop.

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,160
Of course, it's nice to have a big OEM like Lenovo shipping pre-installed laptops.

31
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,020
But what you have to understand here is that Lenovo have paid Canonical in order to certify

32
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,020
these machines.

33
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,080
That's how it works.

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,480
They have this lab in Taipei, Canonical.

35
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,080
And if you want to get your hardware certified, you have to pay them.

36
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,480
And my understanding is it's quite a lot of money and each individual device costs a certain

37
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
amount.

38
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,480
I would imagine a deal was done, but still that is money going into Canonical for what

39
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,200
is essentially Linux desktop.

40
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,620
And so come the IPO or the sale or whatever happens, these are going to be good numbers

41
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,840
to point to on spreadsheets to say that the desktop is making money.

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,760
And so fears of them abandoning it in favor of just cloud and IoT and everything, I think

43
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,240
are unwarranted.

44
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,560
Reading this news gave me a big smile.

45
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,440
In the past, we have missed opportunities during certain industry transitions.

46
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,680
And right now, desktop Linux, especially on the laptops, is looking real good.

47
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,520
And let's just say hypothetically, there is a small percentage of MacBook Pro users that

48
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,840
don't want to switch to ARM, maybe because their end target that they're developing for

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,840
is on x86.

50
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,160
They want to stay on the x86 platform.

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:01,920
Why not move to the Linux that they're running in the cloud since they don't like the direction

52
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,160
Apple's going?

53
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:06,760
In the past, we had some transitions like Unity to GNOME Shell that didn't go very well.

54
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,920
And we lost a lot of users to macOS, in my opinion.

55
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,960
But this time around, we've got some great systems from Lenovo now.

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,320
You've got great systems from independent Linux providers like System76 and Entraware.

57
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,840
And Dell is really at the top of their game.

58
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,280
I have right now in the studio the Dell Precision 5750, in for review, that will feature on

59
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,520
a future Linux Unplugged.

60
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,360
This is a seriously powerful system.

61
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,440
I mean, this is the peak of what I've ever seen Dell build.

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,360
And I feel like we have a lot of really good answers for people that maybe are ready for

63
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,420
a little hardware variety.

64
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:45,560
And instead of only one hardware, one OS, they can switch to Linux and choose the hardware

65
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,880
platform they want.

66
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,600
And oh, by the way, look at all these great options, which are, oh, by the way, once again,

67
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,880
targeted right at developers in the DevOps market.

68
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Yeah.

69
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,040
And instead of having to try and convince the IT department that you're going to install

70
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,540
a separate operating system on the machine that they provide for you, which often doesn't

71
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:09,360
go well, I hear, this is pre-installed with support from the OEM.

72
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,580
There's nothing third party about it.

73
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,440
This is a proper certified Linux machine.

74
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
Right?

75
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,360
I absolutely, absolutely got the OK from IT one time because I was able to point to Dell's

76
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,960
website and say, look, they sell machines with this now.

77
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,840
Yeah, but then you presumably installed Arch or something instead of Ubuntu.

78
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,840
You know, I did.

79
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,280
I also got a ThinkPad.

80
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
But you get the idea.

81
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,800
It did make my case.

82
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,240
Now let's talk about the case for Endeavor OS on ARM devices, which landed this week.

83
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Yeah.

84
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:47,160
Along with the September release of the x86 version, which I tried and was solid as ever,

85
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,720
they are now supporting ARM devices.

86
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,640
Only a few to start with.

87
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:57,480
Three Odroid devices, the Raspberry Pi 4B, which I think most people will be trying this

88
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
on.

89
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,080
And they offer some instructions for some other devices like the Pinebook Pro.

90
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,480
But right now, the kind of official support is the Odroid and Raspberry Pi devices.

91
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,720
And I tried it on a Raspberry Pi 4.

92
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,360
Unfortunately, it's not just an image that you flash.

93
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,800
You have to jump through a few hoops to get it working.

94
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:22,520
But at the end of it, I had an XFCE desktop on top of Arch with the Endeavor OS theming

95
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
and it looked pretty nice.

96
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,300
I got to say, I don't get it.

97
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,560
With all the love to Endeavor OS and its predecessor, Integra, I'm not really getting this one.

98
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,680
So the few steps that you have to take is you get Arch going on a Raspberry Pi, which

99
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,720
granted, isn't complicated, but isn't a sentence that you're going to want to tell most users,

100
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,360
at least beginning users.

101
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,960
And then you set up some repos and point a shell script and let the magic script set

102
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,440
up the rest of the system for you.

103
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,120
And then you end up essentially with an Endeavor OS desktop that's been converted from Arch.

104
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,360
Not a big fan of converting a base install over to something else post-install a number

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,360
A, and number B, if you will.

106
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Now I'm in.

107
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,440
Manjaro, just you get Arch and you flash it right to the SD card and go.

108
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,580
Or Raspberry Pi OS, or any other basic distro that you can get going on the Pi.

109
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,000
You just flash the image and go and that's kind of one of my favorite things is it reminds

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,900
me of the floppy disk era where I'd have a boot disk and I would just boot from that.

111
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,080
And in this case, I would have to set aside these SD cards with this Arch environment

112
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,360
that's ready to go and I just don't really see the value of it other than really, really

113
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
early testing.

114
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,180
Well, I'm going to defend it then because this is not an ordinary Arch install, which

115
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,280
is not particularly difficult, but it is very time consuming and you have to follow the

116
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,640
instructions or learn how to do it.

117
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,000
And OK, once people are practiced at it, they can do it really quickly or whatever.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,440
But for the average person who wants a relatively vanilla Arch installation with XFCE, this

119
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,840
is very, very easy to do, much, much easier than messing around with a normal Arch installation.

120
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,880
All you have to do is clone the Git repository, run one script which flashes it onto the SD

121
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,060
card, put that into the Pi, configure it a little bit, which is all just self explanatory,

122
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,280
and then clone another Git repository, run another script, wait, and then boom, you've

123
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,120
got it all done.

124
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,080
It's much like Endeavor OS X86 version.

125
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,800
It's just giving you a convenient way to get more or less vanilla Arch and Manjaro is great,

126
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,260
but it's not vanilla Arch, is it?

127
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,160
It's Arch with a bunch of value add.

128
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,600
I agree there's value to that.

129
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,120
I also like the idea of being able to get Arch up and going on a Pi a little bit faster.

130
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,460
But I'm going to just say I think you probably lose 90 percent of the people at clone the

131
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,460
Git repo.

132
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,460
Yeah, I know.

133
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,860
Well, yeah, this is not for people who want to use a GUI to flash the SD card and then

134
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,080
just get going straight away.

135
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,560
This is for people who have some experience with Arch, but just want a shortcut.

136
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,600
Yeah, I think the thing that kind of puts me off about it and one of the reasons I don't

137
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:11,640
run vanilla Arch on my Pis is unfortunately, the sad truth is these ARM devices are still

138
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:17,040
not in a general universal state where you can throw any distro at them.

139
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:23,440
You need, I think, still some upstream curation that is packaging things specifically for

140
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,600
the Pi or even maybe making deals with certain vendors, sort of the value add that Manjaro

141
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:35,720
brings to Arch on ARM or Ubuntu brings to Debian on ARM, et cetera.

142
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:41,400
These vendors at this level are actually really adding usable value in this area.

143
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,800
And sometimes they make it even possible to use certain hardware aspects of the device

144
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,160
that aren't enabled by default with the more basic distributions.

145
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,680
Arch is a bit of an edge case because it has such a modern kernel that it almost immediately

146
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,800
has everything upstream that these other projects are working on, but I still kind of feel like

147
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,660
we're in that transitionary phase.

148
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,280
Maybe by the time 2021 rolls around or the next Raspberry Pi comes around, I won't feel

149
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
this way.

150
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,360
But right now, if I'm running a Raspberry Pi and I'm going to use it in production,

151
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,600
there's really only two Linux distributions I'm running on there at the moment because

152
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,320
I'm not a big fan of Raspberry Pi OS directly, just not for me.

153
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,340
It's great for new users, but it's not just really targeted at me.

154
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,040
So I'm sticking with either Ubuntu 2004 LTS or Manjaro.

155
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,720
And I think if you're not running those distros, there's things that just kind of lack or are

156
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,720
missing.

157
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,960
Yeah, that's definitely true.

158
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,720
Like hardware acceleration and things like that are just not quite there with the other

159
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
distros.

160
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,920
So yeah, I do take the point, but some people just want to run relatively vanilla Arch and

161
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,480
choice is good is kind of where I'm coming from.

162
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
But yeah, you are right, ultimately.

163
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,960
Well choice is good, and that's why Microsoft is releasing Edge for Linux, at least in beta

164
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
next month.

165
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,920
Yeah, we've kind of been expecting this for a while.

166
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,240
We knew earlier this year that it was going to come to Linux.

167
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,060
And even when it was first announced on Windows that it was going to be based on Chromium,

168
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,440
we thought, well, there's a good chance it will come to Linux.

169
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,480
Well now we have a date, or at least a month, and that is next month, October.

170
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,000
And we also have a little bit of information about the packaging now.

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,280
It's going to be available as either an RPM or a Deb, not a snap though, which I'm surprised

172
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,600
about because of Microsoft's relationship with Canonical.

173
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:28,200
I think this is a very easy story for the Linux enthusiast to dismiss because who amongst

174
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,080
us is likely going to opt to use Edge?

175
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:40,240
Probably not many, but this may be one of the biggest tells in what Microsoft's direction

176
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,840
is that we have seen since they started to love Linux.

177
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,280
This is a huge data point.

178
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,440
And I want to get into this for a moment because I think this indicates a global strategy by

179
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,920
Microsoft that we should talk about.

180
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,320
So let's start with what we know here.

181
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,200
Edge's value from Microsoft, they have said this directly, is that this is the business

182
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
browser.

183
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah, that's how they actually position it as.

184
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,600
Edge is the Chrome for business.

185
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,960
So they kind of have acknowledged that the blink engine seems to be the way to go.

186
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,880
So now the value that Microsoft feels like they can bring is, we'll adult up Chrome.

187
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,480
We'll get it ready for the enterprise.

188
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,040
This is Chromium, but for the enterprise.

189
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,600
Now that's something because Chromium is an open source project.

190
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,340
And it's Microsoft signaling that we can take open source or free software and we can package

191
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,600
it up and we can deliver it for enterprise.

192
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,480
And it's perfectly leveraging their brand, which is known for building things for enterprise

193
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
customers.

194
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,140
And I think it betrays an insecurity that is deep inside a lot of large old school corporations

195
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,220
that CTOs and others hold.

196
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,340
And that is that free software isn't enterprise ready, that it needs to be packaged up and

197
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,360
sold to them.

198
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,800
And that's what Microsoft can come along and do.

199
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,520
And if you think about it, there's no reason that this logic can't apply to anything in

200
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,780
open source and free software.

201
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,760
Anything where there's an opportunity to come along and package up, say the work of Google

202
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,920
in this case, and add value that resonates for their customers is going to be an easy

203
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,960
slam dunk.

204
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:22,360
And so by bringing Edge over to Linux, what they are saying is, business world, you will

205
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,040
now have one browser to focus your support on, one browser to focus your security policies

206
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,580
and your manuals on.

207
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:34,080
You can standardize on Edge, which will be compatible with anything that works with Chromium.

208
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,200
It's business safe.

209
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,840
Yeah, that's clearly the market they're going after.

210
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,160
But I think the enthusiasts are not going to be having this.

211
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,320
It's weird that a lot of people will just install Chrome without thinking, and that's

212
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,840
just a random proprietary deb or IPM or whatever.

213
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,880
But somehow they don't trust Microsoft.

214
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,600
And you asked us this week, I think it was in Slack, who would you prefer to trust?

215
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,800
Or who do you trust the most out of Google and Microsoft?

216
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,840
And I thought about it, and I don't know.

217
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,960
I think ultimately, Google probably, because they know all my stuff anyway, they know everything

218
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
about me.

219
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Yeah, that surprised me.

220
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,960
It was a good answer.

221
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,320
It's like, well, I've already revealed everything to Google, so now why reveal something to

222
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Microsoft?

223
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,760
And well, linked in the show notes to a research paper on the telemetry and identity tracking

224
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,040
that Edge apparently does.

225
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,560
I can't speak authoritatively to it, but we will have some data there.

226
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,120
Now, I thought about that, too, and I thought, yeah, but.

227
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:36,920
The thing is, Google is institutionally aligned to exploit that data.

228
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,960
It's literally in the fabric of the company to exploit and utilize data.

229
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:47,600
Whereas Microsoft, kind of like Apple, but not nearly as severe, is not a data first

230
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
company.

231
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,400
They have quickly figured out how to utilize it, especially in terms of bug metrics and

232
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,280
Windows data collection metrics.

233
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,980
But if you look at the information that Microsoft supposedly has been collecting now for years

234
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:06,220
from Windows Vista on, I don't see them building the same personalized systems and ad curation

235
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,520
systems that I see coming from Google.

236
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,960
It sort of seems like it's just sitting in a SQL database somewhere, and I'm not saying

237
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:18,200
I'm comfortable with it, but I may actually trust Microsoft's incompetence to execute

238
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,080
on the data more than I trust Google with my data, because I know Google will execute

239
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,480
and do something with that data.

240
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,440
Yeah, I suppose Microsoft's a bit of a halfway house, because they do have ads in Windows

241
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,360
10 in the start menu and stuff.

242
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:35,000
So they do try at least with that stuff, but yeah, I think you're right that Google does

243
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,480
a lot better of a job with your data and targeting ads and everything.

244
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,480
It's funny, you know, speaking of Microsoft, Eric Raymond wrote a piece this week about

245
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,400
the desktop wars, pretty much agreeing with what I'd said that Microsoft's end goal is

246
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,560
to pretty much move to a Linux-based system.

247
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,520
Ooh, that really seems still far out there, but this is his pitch.

248
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,320
He says, Microsoft Windows becomes a proton-like emulation layer over a Linux kernel, with

249
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,760
the layer getting thinner over time as more of the support lands in the mainline kernel

250
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,760
sources.

251
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,380
Which, to his point here, Joe, we have seen kernel patches to improve WSL support land.

252
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,000
We haven't seen them integrated yet, but we have seen them sent in for review.

253
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,160
He goes on to say here, though, that the economic motive is that Microsoft sheds an even larger

254
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,280
fraction of its development costs, and less and less has to be done in-house.

255
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,560
So I guess the argument here could be, look at the advantage they have with taking the

256
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,960
Blink source code and Chromium.

257
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,280
They saved years of having to invent a new web engine, and that's even after they invested

258
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:42,120
decades into Triton.

259
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,680
So could you imagine the cost if they had to invest another couple of decades into an

260
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,280
entirely new web engine?

261
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,080
Instead, they can just take Chromium.

262
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,840
Yeah, I think it's still out there, and I don't think it's that likely.

263
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,800
Definitely not anytime soon, but it's interesting to read that just a few days after I had said

264
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,960
something quite similar.

265
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,040
Yeah, he says the best evidence is the fact that Microsoft has done this with Edge.

266
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,700
He says it only makes sense that, as part of this, this is a test to get Windows users

267
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,600
using software on both platforms, and that he had envisions that eventually you would

268
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,320
just remove aspects of the emulation layer and more and more become native until it's

269
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,840
just the really Edge case applications.

270
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,440
He kind of wraps it up as this.

271
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,160
He says the end state is the new Windows is mostly a Linux kernel.

272
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,160
There's an old Windows emulation over it, but Edge and the rest of the Windows user

273
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,600
land utilities don't use emulation.

274
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,160
That emulation layer is there only for games and legacy third-party software.

275
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,960
He says economic pressure alone will cause this and also cause Microsoft to deprecate

276
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:46,040
the emulation layer over time to the point where third-party software providers will

277
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:52,680
stop shipping Windows binaries in favor of ELF binaries with a pure Linux API, and that

278
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,840
essentially Windows will get co-opted, and that's how Linux will win the desktop war

279
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,120
is kind of by just taking it all over.

280
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Well, like I say, dare to dream.

281
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,400
Linux.ting.com.

282
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,320
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

283
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,840
You pay for what you use.

284
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,000
Nationwide coverage, three carriers to choose from.

285
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,640
I'm on Verizon right now.

286
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,640
And no contracts.

287
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,680
They don't get you locked into something.

288
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,380
And honestly, if you can, bring your device.

289
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,560
If you go to linux.ting.com, click on the check your phone.

290
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,320
And when you go there, you just put in the information about your phone, and they'll

291
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,000
tell you what your situation is compatibility-wise.

292
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,800
If you have a compatible device, that's the way to go because you'll get a $25 service

293
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,960
credit, and that's likely to pay for more than your first month.

294
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,120
Average Ting bill for a line after your usage is $24, and you can get a device directly

295
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,040
from Ting as well if you think maybe it's time.

296
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,400
They've got everything from the Pixel 4a and the iPhone SE directly, and of course the

297
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,040
latest Moto and Galaxy phones.

298
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,080
But they also have the new mobile.

299
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
Check out the new mobile device.

300
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,600
I know, I'd never heard of it either.

301
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,980
I had not heard of it, but it's $79 brand new.

302
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,120
But if you go to linux.ting.com, they'll give you $25 towards a new device.

303
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,080
You can get this brand new flip phone.

304
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,240
It's a flip phone with like forever battery, LTE data support.

305
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,040
It's actually pretty great, and you can once again flip the phone down to hang up on people.

306
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,320
It's got a front-facing screen too with just a basic clock on it, but what else do you

307
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
need?

308
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,080
And it's got a camera, so should the worst happen, you need to take a picture of it,

309
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,360
you can do it.

310
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,440
You can go simple with Ting, or you can go as luxury as you want.

311
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,580
Get started at linux.ting.com.

312
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:39,340
Go over there, read a little bit about it, see how they do things a little differently,

313
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,600
take their control panel, which I don't know why the rest of the industry hasn't ripped

314
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
this thing off.

315
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,000
Their dashboard is the best.

316
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,200
You can see all your usage at a glance, you can take complete control, you can set usage

317
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,280
alerts, you can nickname lines, so if you've got a couple of lines for your kids or a partner,

318
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,520
it's super easy to keep track of everything.

319
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:59,280
And when you need help, either in the app or on the phone, there's a real person there

320
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
to help you.

321
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,320
So get started at linux.ting.com, support the show, and get a $25 service credit or

322
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,240
$25 towards your first device.

323
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,980
That's linux.ting.com.

324
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,520
Another week and another project that is being spun out of Mozilla.

325
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,960
And this time it's Mozilla Web Things, their Internet of Things platform.

326
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,520
Yeah, there seems to be two trajectories at this point for a former Mozilla project.

327
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,000
Either they just shut it down completely like we saw recently with Firefox Send and Firefox

328
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Notes.

329
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,620
And yeah, maybe the code's available, but as a project and a structure and an organization,

330
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,720
it is no more.

331
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,720
And then you have the Web Things and some of the other projects we're out, which there

332
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,820
seems to have been enough momentum and enough adoption that they can survive independently

333
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,720
of the Mozilla organization.

334
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,400
And that's what's happening here with Web Things.

335
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,360
David Bryant writes on the Mozilla discourse, we're writing to inform you that the Web Things

336
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,960
project is being spun out of Mozilla as an independent open source project.

337
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,360
Mozilla is winding down its direct involvement with Web Things and is transitioning control

338
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,340
and responsibility to the community.

339
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:11,280
Web Things is what powers a gateway that runs on your LAN that controls your IoT devices.

340
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,100
So they don't have to rely on cloud services.

341
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,720
Similar to how I use Home Assistant, Web Things was another option.

342
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,640
Now the good news here, Joe, is that it does seem to be like a transition path to the community

343
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
supported version.

344
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,780
So if people are using Web Things right now as an IoT gateway, they're not SOL.

345
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,300
Their support will continue, I guess I should say.

346
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,000
Why did you never use this then?

347
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,040
The same way I've picked a lot of open source projects in the past thinking about it, it's

348
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,360
started with the community.

349
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,920
There was just a lot of community activity around Home Assistant.

350
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,200
There was a lot of excitement in our audience.

351
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,100
And you know how it goes when you start getting messages that are like, hey, you should really

352
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,660
check this thing out over here.

353
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,660
Have you seen this?

354
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,640
You get a couple of those and another couple of days go by and you get a couple more and

355
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,740
you're like, oh, maybe there is something.

356
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,640
So Home Assistant had that going for it.

357
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,400
There's other ones like this, too.

358
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,080
There's platforms from Dell and the Linux Foundation that were created, and I haven't

359
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,400
seen a big uptick in that adoption either.

360
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,360
And it really kind of seems like what happened was is these projects were created and they

361
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:18,200
are successful to a degree, but their success is limited in how much they can integrate

362
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,640
with proprietary solutions.

363
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,480
That's something else that Home Assistant is really good at, is there's thousands of

364
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,920
different integrations to plug in with cloud providers that don't even necessarily have

365
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:33,200
an API, to cloud providers that do, to devices that are local, to devices that are cloud

366
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
controlled.

367
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,300
It can work with all of it.

368
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:41,240
And it just seems to have a really wide range of support because of that community.

369
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,840
Where some of these other things like web things were a little more limited in their

370
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:50,020
scope and not as easy to just throw on a Raspberry Pi or a VM or something you just tossed in

371
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:53,960
Docker real quick and then it just auto-discovered all these devices on your network.

372
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,760
They all have various versions of this.

373
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,080
I was just never impressed by what web things offered.

374
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,720
But I know it works for some people and I know it's great in some business solutions,

375
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,720
too.

376
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,720
It just wasn't hitting my buttons.

377
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,760
But the good news is, as you said, they're not just abandoning this.

378
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,560
They are going to hand it over to the community.

379
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:17,160
And even if you've got a MozillaIoT.org subdomain with them, that will still be available until

380
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
the end of the year.

381
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,040
Yeah, that seems to be the most abrupt change here is if you are taking advantage of that

382
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:29,040
MozillaIoT.org domain, you've got essentially a few months as we record this.

383
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,760
And then I'd say the other thing you need to look out for is the project will have to

384
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,920
transition how it issues updates.

385
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,920
And those updates, instead of coming from Mozilla, will come from the project now.

386
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,760
And so you'll have to opt into that, but they'll have more information on how you'll do that

387
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
soon.

388
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,920
And that's ultimately just part of a trend that we've been seeing for quite some time

389
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,120
where Mozilla just has to tighten the purse strings.

390
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,160
They can't have too many of these projects, seemingly.

391
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,360
They have to just shut them down and make sure they're not spending too much.

392
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,360
I wish that were true, Joe.

393
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,360
I wish what we saw here with Mozilla was a group that recognized the dire situation their

394
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:10,200
Firefox web browser is in and were taking keen, decisive action to, as they like to

395
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,000
say, forgive the expression because I think it's awful in this case, trim the fat.

396
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,240
And they were just focusing on making Firefox as great as possible.

397
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,600
But that's not what we're seeing here.

398
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,480
That's what's so frustrating is another announcement from Mozilla this week is they're launching

399
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:33,440
the European AI Fund, which is a ton of money, $1.6 million.

400
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,480
They're dumping into this thing and it's completely 100% a social and political play.

401
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,600
There is nothing about making Firefox better.

402
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,200
Are they actually investing any money in this, though, because they say in its first step,

403
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,640
the fund will launch with a 1 million euro open call for funding.

404
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,320
Doesn't that mean that they're looking for funding from elsewhere?

405
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
Or the partners.

406
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:59,040
It's a group of national, regional, international partners that are participating in this.

407
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,800
And it seems Mozilla is in the driver's seat, at least to a significant degree here, because

408
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,300
the shared project site shares a lot of language that's on the Mozilla announcement.

409
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,520
The two mirror each other a lot.

410
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,360
The reason why they're doing this and organizing this and putting all of their energy and effort

411
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,960
and time, which is money as well, into this is they say, we seek to deepen the pool of

412
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,240
experts across Europe who have the tools capacity know how to catalog and monitor social and

413
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,000
political impact of AI and data driven interventions and hold them accountable for it.

414
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,160
With this group of national and regional international foundations in Europe that will be dedicated

415
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,400
to using their resources, financial and otherwise, to strengthen civil society.

416
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,040
I mean, this sounds great, really.

417
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,600
But this sounds like the kind of stuff that Apple should be doing.

418
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,960
But Mozilla is a struggling company to even get users to even open their core product

419
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,960
at this point.

420
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
That's the reality we're at here.

421
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,000
They continue on making it clear that this entire effort is about social issues with

422
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,120
at Mozilla.

423
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,520
We've seen firsthand the expertise that civil society can provide when it comes to the intersection

424
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:09,900
of AI, consumer rights, racial justice and economic justice.

425
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,080
We've collaborated closely over the years with partners like the European Digital Rights,

426
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,940
Access Now Algorithm Watch and Digital Freedom Fund.

427
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,960
So I looked into some of these groups and I'm not impressed, Joe.

428
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,640
I mean, I sent you some of the things I found about these groups and none of this really

429
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,840
seems to benefit Mozilla in the long term or Firefox.

430
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,120
It is high gold, high moral.

431
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,800
It's something that I can appreciate that they're putting effort into, but it just doesn't

432
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,120
seem to match up with laying off over 200 developers.

433
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,160
It doesn't seem to match up with cutting all of the projects.

434
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,640
It doesn't seem to match up with all of the things we've seen about the slide in their

435
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,480
market share and what they're trying to do to make that better.

436
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,620
I don't get it.

437
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,800
It's like they don't even realize the situation they're in.

438
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
Yeah.

439
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:59,080
When I was reading about this, it did strike me, as a friend of mine would say, a tea-drinking,

440
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:05,720
leak-eating boondoggle, which is just sort of bureaucracy for its own sake almost.

441
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:12,180
It won't necessarily achieve much beyond just more bureaucracy, which Mozilla just seems

442
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,280
to be bogged down in.

443
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Yeah.

444
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:19,260
Well, another story we've been following over the last couple of years is open source business

445
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,100
models in the cloud era.

446
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:28,000
This week, TimescaleDB have updated their license to hopefully find a good compromise.

447
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,880
Yeah, I really like what's in here.

448
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,240
I'm going to say that up front because I'm also going to have a little fun at their expense.

449
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,720
If you're not familiar with TimescaleDB, it's pretty slick.

450
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,420
It offers massive scale, hundreds of billions of rows and millions of inserts per second

451
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,960
on a single server.

452
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,760
We're talking like there's definitely a use case for this, especially at really large

453
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
scale.

454
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,560
That's why its developer community includes engineers from Rackspace, IBM, DigitalOcean,

455
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:59,480
Samsung, Siemens, Uber, Walmart, Warner Music, thousands of large companies that just have

456
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,560
these massive data transactions use TimescaleDB.

457
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:07,440
It's a pretty important player, and it was one of the early ones to start experimenting

458
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,560
with this.

459
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,240
They landed on their license about two years ago.

460
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,520
It's called the TSL, which stands for Timescale License.

461
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,200
Now, here's where I'm going to have a little fun with them because they kind of really

462
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,280
go all in on this post, kind of really patting themselves on the back for paving the way,

463
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,280
as it were.

464
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:31,800
But they write, two years later, this experiment has been so successful, exceeding our expectations,

465
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,560
that we're changing tons of stuff.

466
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:38,200
They write, this experiment has gone so well, we're announcing an update to the TSL that

467
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,480
reinforces our commitment to the community and loosens lots of restrictions.

468
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,800
And they throw a few things in here like, you now have the right to repair, the right

469
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,200
to improve.

470
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,640
All enterprise features are now free.

471
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,600
No more usage limits and simplified legalese.

472
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,920
I mean, check, check, check.

473
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,540
That's all really good stuff.

474
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,960
It's just the whole build up is about how successful it's been, but we think it needs

475
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
these changes.

476
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,960
I have to poke them a little bit of fun for that because it's essentially admitting it

477
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,180
wasn't perfect.

478
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,580
But now with these things in here, we may have ourselves here, Joe, a genuine model

479
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,580
for others to follow.

480
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,660
Yeah, that's kind of how I read it.

481
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,760
They've managed to get the likes of Amazon to do business deals with them so that they

482
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,520
can offer it as a service.

483
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,080
And they've built this sustainable business model based on that.

484
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,840
And hopefully other people will follow this.

485
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,560
It's still not totally open source by the OSI definition.

486
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:35,680
But the argument they make, which I think is pretty strong, is that the OSI model is

487
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:42,720
just not fit for purpose in 2020 when we've got AWS, Azure, and GCP and all the other

488
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,960
cloud providers.

489
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:48,800
It just doesn't make sense for certain projects to have a properly free and open source license.

490
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,160
Yeah, that's essentially it.

491
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,080
I'll add there are a couple of clearly not allowed things that are outlined on the website

492
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
here.

493
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,000
The one that sticks out to me the most is you can't redistribute modified source code.

494
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,880
But there's a couple others in there as well.

495
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,520
I think that's all overshadowed by what they have allowed here.

496
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,020
The big one that's going to have knock on ramifications for the industry is the removal

497
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,400
of the enterprise tier.

498
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,080
They're making all of the software under an Apache 2 or TSL license just available for

499
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,080
free.

500
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,400
They've got this weird tier you have to buy and they note that that actually simplifies

501
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
things for them too.

502
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,520
They don't have to have this internal debate now and which ones do we hold back for the

503
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,360
enterprise tier and which ones do we make available for everyone.

504
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,200
So I think that one big give here for the enterprise tier may be what really lasts as

505
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,600
the big news ongoing.

506
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,600
And the fact that we now have something here with the timescale license that may prove

507
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,440
to be a sustainable license model.

508
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,360
Yeah, and I think the key thing here is that they differentiate between a value added service

509
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,920
and just hosting it as a service.

510
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:55,760
So if you add timescale DB into your own project and build a service around that, that's fine

511
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,360
as long as you're adding value and that's what they clearly explain.

512
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,800
So what they've done is pretty much make it an open source license for everyone apart

513
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,560
from the cloud providers.

514
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,540
And I remember when we talked about this, it must've been a couple of years ago, I said

515
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:15,400
someone who is much, much cleverer than I am will come up with a solution to this.

516
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,040
And here we are a couple of years later.

517
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,000
And I think it is the solution that they need for this.

518
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,040
