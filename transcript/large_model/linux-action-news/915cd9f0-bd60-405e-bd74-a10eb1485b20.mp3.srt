00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,100
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:19,620
This is episode 5 recorded on June 11th, 2017.

3
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,620
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,620
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:27,260
Hello Joe, happy episode 5 to you and tip of the hat, this isn't the biggest, most active

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,280
news week we have had since we started the show, but you still managed to dig a few nuggets

7
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,160
out of the ground and we have some good stories.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,920
Should we kick it off with some Ubuntu news?

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,780
Yeah, pretty Ubuntu heavy to start with.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,920
First of all, they are transitioning to Gnome Shell.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,160
Well, that's not news, but they've actually started now.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,880
The daily images have got rid of Unity and are using Gnome 3, Gnome Shell.

13
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,600
But the slight difference is they've actually got buttons on the left still.

14
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,040
Oh my gosh, that's what you go for.

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,280
And immediately, oh, of course, of course they would probably cite continuity.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,840
It is a little newsworthy because we all thought this would be landing in the LTS.

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,440
I know it's been announced since, but it's just a reminder that 1710 is going to be the

18
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,120
switch over to Gnome 3.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,960
So they got the buttons on the left, but they've also made a decision, not that one, but they've

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,240
made a decision that I'm really happy about.

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,080
They're going to switch from LightDM to GDM, which has worked better for me on my Gnome

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
setups too.

23
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,800
Yeah, I suppose it makes sense really, they wanted to just simplify things, didn't they?

24
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,400
Yeah, and I think it also came down to something about their guest session support.

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,160
It would have just taken a pretty big amount of work to add the support to LightDM, and

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,120
it takes a less amount of work to get it working in GDM.

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:41,720
And they might not have it in 1710, but they'll have the guest sessions back by 1804, they

28
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
suspect.

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,800
Yeah, and I mentioned the buttons kind of half-jokingly, but I think that it does show

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,440
that they're already thinking about putting their personal stamp on it.

31
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,600
They don't want it to be just totally stock.

32
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
I think you're probably right.

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,400
The feelers they've been putting out on the surveys on OMG Ubuntu kind of indicate their

34
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
intention too.

35
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,640
Here's something I take as a good sign out of all of this, though.

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,680
Canonical is playing host to a fractional scaling hackfest for Gnome in its Taipei offices

37
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
this week.

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,840
Gnome developers and Ubuntu developers are in attendance, and they've scrounged together

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,080
the high DPI monitors from all around the office to plug into their Gnome machines,

40
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,280
and this is real good, like, actual adult scaling.

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,360
What we have right now in Gnome is either double scaling or no scaling.

42
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
It's baby scaling.

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,520
It's first-step scaling.

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
It's adorable scaling.

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
It gets you there.

46
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,440
But this is grown-up adult scaling, where you can actually fractionally scale it up

47
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,440
and down.

48
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,200
Yeah, now, I can't afford a 4K monitor, so high DPI is just a distant dream for me.

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,240
But having spoken to Aiki quite a lot about it, he said that Unity was the best experience

50
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,720
that he'd had, and so it's good to see that we're not just going to lose that because

51
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,160
the Ubuntu team are actually going to plow that knowledge and experience into Gnome and

52
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,760
try and improve it, which it kind of goes against a little bit against what I had originally

53
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,400
said that they wanted to just offload the development totally to the Gnome team and

54
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,280
just offload the desktop.

55
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,440
But it shows that they are still investing in it, and that's what people had hoped, that

56
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,440
they would invest in the desktop.

57
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,040
They're adding a lot of the Unity-type features that people really required to Gnome 3.

58
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,880
Yeah, and hopefully it'll be better as a result of it.

59
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,040
Also they're testing X Wayland compatibility, which seems like a pretty good thing.

60
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
Looking forward.

61
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:32,240
Yeah, because Wayland, although it's getting there, and if you look at Fedora using it

62
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,400
as default, it seems to be working well for most people, but I do see on Google+, some

63
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,320
people having issues with it still.

64
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,600
So I don't think you can fully expect Wayland to just work completely.

65
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,640
So yeah, I think it is something that they're going to need to work on.

66
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,840
I mean, that was, funnily enough, the thing that always held MIR up, wasn't it?

67
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,120
The XMIR support, because they knew that they would have to have four people to actually

68
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,180
use the thing, and that's what made it never quite reach stable status and default.

69
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,820
By the way, if you're grabbing the daily ISOs right now, you'll find that Unity 7 is no

70
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,820
longer default.

71
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,320
It's not even offered as an option from the login manager.

72
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,420
However, if you're doing an upgrade, the packages are still in the repo.

73
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,800
So you'll still have Unity 7, and they are available from the universe archive, if things

74
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,200
don't go smoothly for you.

75
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,900
Do you think that's an indication that it's not going to be there?

76
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,880
Because there was a little bit of confusion as to exactly what was going to happen with

77
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
it.

78
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,800
They'd said that it would be there for people upgrading, but I mean, does this mean that

79
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,360
it's just definitely not going to be an option for people installing it new?

80
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Possibly, yeah.

81
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Yeah, I think so.

82
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,040
I mean, it's going to be in the universe, so there'll probably be a meta package that

83
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,120
you could install to bring it down.

84
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,600
But otherwise, they're just moving on.

85
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,200
Yeah, I think that's probably true.

86
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,600
And maybe others want to move on to something like Lubuntu.

87
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Yeah, so it turns out Lubuntu 17.10 will probably ship two different spins or versions.

88
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,280
One LXDE, which is nothing new, hasn't changed for a long time, and the other LXCute.

89
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,200
Now, that's the one I've been following with a little more interest, just because it's

90
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,280
newer, a little more newsworthy, and also I'm a big fan of Qt.

91
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,600
Yeah, you know, I'm not a huge fan of Qt.

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
What?

93
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
What?

94
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,600
What?

95
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,600
How do you just...

96
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,600
What?

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Well, I just...

98
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,720
There's something about the way it looks by default that I just don't like, and I prefer

99
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
GTK.

100
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,560
But at the same time, I can see the way GTK is going and how much churn there is there

101
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,440
and how difficult it is to follow the development of it.

102
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,700
I think you would be surprised, too.

103
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,120
There's some Qt apps that are Qt and you don't realize it, the way they look.

104
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,320
Well, yeah, VLC is a prime example that you wouldn't necessarily notice that.

105
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,840
But I am following the LXCute development.

106
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,400
I have been on and off.

107
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,600
It's been a little while.

108
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,800
And when I heard about this, I thought, well, I'll have a look at the daily...

109
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,540
I saw it, Lubuntu Next, they're calling it, which is kind of like the Ubuntu Next used

110
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,840
to be with the mere, by default, Unity 8.

111
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,160
And I spent it up live thinking, I'll just have a quick look at it.

112
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,960
This is on my test laptop that's got quite a few different partitions on it.

113
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,600
And I think that what I'm about to say speaks volumes.

114
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,280
I installed it.

115
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,920
I want to see more about this, I want to check it out more.

116
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,440
And you, as a devout ex-FCE user, were drawn to this.

117
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
Yeah.

118
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,000
I mean, hey, this is really quite good and quite promising.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,280
I mean, it's buggy.

120
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,520
It's nowhere near a daily driver.

121
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,240
I mean, it's a daily ISO.

122
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
It's not supposed to be.

123
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,560
It's not even alpha yet.

124
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,920
So you're not going to rely on it yet, but to check it out and to see how it's working.

125
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Right.

126
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,040
And it's a good time to give feedback there.

127
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,180
They're specifically looking for feedback on their new default applications, like they've

128
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,400
switched over to GNOME MPV as a default media player.

129
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,920
They've also changed around some of the network management stack, so we might want to help

130
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,280
them test that and give them feedback.

131
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Now would be a good time.

132
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,040
But do you like it?

133
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,080
Are you considering when the final ships, you might, you know, give it an install?

134
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,320
Well, I will definitely install it, probably not on my main machine to start with.

135
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Oh, of course.

136
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Oh, of course.

137
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,640
That's why I have this other machine to test stuff on.

138
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,040
But yeah, I am very impressed with the progress.

139
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,880
As I say, I've been following it on and off, and it must have been at least six months

140
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,200
since I looked at it last.

141
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,640
And I think it has iterated a little bit in that time, and it does seem to be improving.

142
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:50,080
And you get the kind of benefits of Qt without the complexity of KDE and, you know, Plasma.

143
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,160
And the thing is that I can make Plasma how I want it, which is essentially quite similar

144
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,280
to LXQt, or I could just use LXQt, why bother?

145
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Yeah.

146
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,240
I was thinking about that too for some of our production systems, that was my exact

147
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
line of thinking.

148
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,000
And while we're just like swimming deep in the Ubuntu universe, let me put this out there.

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,540
If a lot of the spins of Ubuntu existed simply to offer an alternative to Unity, once Unity

150
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:22,380
goes away and GNOME becomes the default desktop, it seems like there's less and less motivation

151
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:28,800
for some of these distributions to exist, and now our focus might be shifting to ones

152
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,420
that provide something completely different than Ubuntu GNOME, and that would be really

153
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:39,320
low resources or super small footprints, optimized for appliance-like workloads, things like

154
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
that.

155
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Do you agree?

156
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,600
Like, maybe we're seeing a new opportunity for Ubuntu derivatives here?

157
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
Well, I don't know.

158
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,600
I think that you've always had the traditional desktop look at Ubuntu MATE, the alternative

159
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,180
to GNOME, which is a whole new way of doing things.

160
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,920
It's not that new to a lot of people, but in the kind of grand scheme of it, the long

161
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,120
timeline from 20 plus years, it is still a relatively new way to interact with the computer.

162
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:13,600
And people who don't want to use that new way have got plenty of options, from KDE Plasma,

163
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:20,100
which is at the higher end of the resource scale, through MATE and XFCE, and now down

164
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,920
to LXQ.

165
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:30,040
So for me, it's not necessarily about these different workloads and implementations and

166
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,440
what you're actually going to do with it.

167
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,600
It's in some ways just more about wanting it to work a certain way.

168
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,060
Yeah, and it's about what you want to devote your computer's resources to in time and also

169
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,060
what matches your workflow.

170
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,640
I just, to me, it seems like some of these lower resources distributions are appealing

171
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,040
to me more than ever.

172
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:53,360
You get a standard base, but a really nice, light, lean desktop.

173
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,360
So I'm following LXQ with quite a bit of interest, but yeah, like I said, now is a good time

174
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,000
to jump in and give them the feedback about the default apps and keep an eye out for new

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,920
artwork coming down the pike very soon.

Now this is a platform to learn more about Linux.

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,880
It's a perfect sponsor for this show.

182
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,160
They have the system.

183
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,160
This is all they do.

184
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,080
They focus on Linux, open source, and the ecosystem around it that really makes you

185
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:37,480
money and pads the resume, like OpenStack, Azure, AWS, all of that stuff around Linux.

186
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,680
But you can start at the very core.

187
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,600
Learn about the basics on the command line, get involved with their self-paced, in-depth

188
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,840
video courses, their hands-on, scenario-based labs.

189
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,240
They spin up servers on demand when you need them.

190
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,080
Real human being instructors are available when you need help, and a core scheduler that

191
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,080
matches your busy schedule.

192
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,660

Unplugged.

196
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:17,040
So back in October last year, Canonical announced the live kernel patching service for Ubuntu

197
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
16.04.

198
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:24,800
Fast forward to this week, and they have announced that it's now available for Ubuntu 14.04 as

199
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,800
well.

200
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Yeah.

201
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,520
Users of Ubuntu 14.04 with the 64-bit kernel can get their live patch service for free

202
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,920
up to three machines.

203
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
Yeah.

204
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,720
Or you can register a few different accounts.

205
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,520
I'm sorry, cough.

206
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,520
What?

207
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,600
Or you can go to their Advantage program at Ubuntu.com slash Advantage, which honestly

208
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,280
if I was in a business, I would probably do that.

209
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Yeah, yeah.

210
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,240
I mean, it would be ridiculous to do it the other way.

211
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,120
But it's interesting that they're doing it for 14.04.

212
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,280
It shows that they do care about long-term support.

213
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,640
Just look at 12.04 being supported.

214
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,720
You can pay them for a bit of extra support on that.

215
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,000
So they really are trying to compete with Red Hat, basically, aren't they?

216
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,660
I suppose it does suggest that.

217
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,120
To me, it also suggests that they have an XP effect happening with their old releases.

218
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:19,960
I would bet you that a dirty secret of both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu LTS is

219
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,120
that once users install them, they essentially don't upgrade those systems until they replace

220
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
those systems.

221
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,760
Well, that's what happens in enterprise, doesn't it?

222
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,760
Generally.

223
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,760
Whether it's Windows or Linux.

224
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,000
Wouldn't it be nice, though, if we could keep these systems patched and current?

225
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,440
Now, I'm not trying to sit here and advocate that change just for change sake needs to

226
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
happen.

227
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,080
But I am trying to suggest that there is a certain level of technological progress between

228
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:46,200
major Linux kernels and major daemons that would be beneficial for the Internet in whole.

229
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,480
And so in moderation, where it made sense, it would be nice if these systems could have

230
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,280
been upgraded much easier and not have to sit here and inject code into live memory

231
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
to keep them secure.

232
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,360
I grant you it's a clever solution.

233
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,760
It's definitely one I would sign up for if I was in a business.

234
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,380
I'm impressed by the service.

235
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:07,840
I just think it's an unfortunate hack that we've sort of back-engineered into to replace

236
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,120
live code and memory because we can't upgrade our systems.

237
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,360
It sounds like you're advocating ARCH in the enterprise.

238
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
I'm not.

239
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,360
I am not doing that.

240
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,360
I'm not saying that.

241
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,240
However, if you do, I suggest you install the LTS kernel.

242
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,420
That's Chris's hashtag ARCH advice.

243
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,480
But the idea of live patching your kernel doesn't sit very well with me.

244
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Oh, really, Joe?

245
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
I'm shocked.

246
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,480
Yeah.

247
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
You're shocked that I'm negative about this.

248
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,200
Well, look, put it this way.

249
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,600
If you've got infrastructure that is so critical that you can't spare 30 seconds to reboot

250
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,200
it, then why don't you have a redundant server that you can switch to instantly?

251
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,360
That's the way things are supposed to be done, right?

252
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,240
I suppose in an ideal universe, that's probably true.

253
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,200
So you switch to your redundant server, do your upgrade, reboot, make sure all your daemons

254
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,280
come up, everything's working fine, switch back to it, and then do the same thing for

255
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
your redundant server.

256
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,680
I bet every different enterprise has their scenario.

257
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,020
I could give you mine.

258
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,720
So take for example here our OBS streaming system.

259
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,760
If we were to reboot it, our stream goes down.

260
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
Not a big deal.

261
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,760
But there's no way to...

262
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,240
You can't just move another system in there and continue that stream.

263
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,240
There's no...

264
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,280
I guess you could engineer a really complex system.

265
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,600
But there's so much engineering involved to make that happen that it's just much easier

266
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,840
to have one system streaming it that gets patched properly.

267
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,920
It's just a whole other scale to try to have a redundant OBS system that we could switch

268
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,000
to in real time to keep our stream online to apply a patch.

269
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,800
So I could definitely understand how systems that are involved in transactions or record

270
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:43,220
keeping or time keeping or log keeping or video monitoring where they're recording something,

271
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,640
it's really hard to do a replacement system.

272
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,400
Not everything's web servers and databases.

273
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
True, true.

274
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,800
And I suppose this is more aimed at the smaller enterprise then, the kind of people who don't

275
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:57,480
have the money to have redundant service for everything.

276
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
Perhaps.

277
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,480
Perhaps.

278
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,640
I would think this is a killer service for small and large business.

279
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,160
Really in any kind of large enterprise, in my experience, there is a rigorous change

280
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,200
management process when you want to install a patch and reboot.

281
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,200
It involves, for my particular experience, it involved creating a change request form,

282
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,120
which was a three page form, and then I had to attend a Thursday weekly meeting where

283
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:25,960
I had to advocate my change in a group of people that were just there to essentially

284
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,680
ask me why I really needed to do this and nitpick every little decision.

285
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,320
And then once I advocated the change, I could then go schedule a time in off hours to install

286
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,980
the patch within the next week and then I had to attend the following change control

287
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,520
meeting to advise the committee on how my change had went.

288
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,320
This all changes if you can start swapping code in and out of memory in real time.

289
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,560
I sign up for this service, I let it go, I do one change control request to enable the

290
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,320
service and do its business, and I'm done.

291
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
Yeah, but is that going to wash with them?

292
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,160
Are they going to accept that?

293
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
I think so.

294
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
I think if you pitch it right.

295
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,020
I mean, I realize to you it seems like a huge difference, but to them it's, I mean to you

296
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,840
it seems like a small nuance, but to them it's a huge difference between actively installing

297
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:15,240
software, rebooting systems, making all, because that entire process involves coordinating

298
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,400
with multiple departments and people, whereas this is something that just happens transparently

299
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,400
in the background.

300
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,640
But surely that isn't going to go down well, making changes transparently in the background.

301
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,120
Even if it is security patches, it sounds like that, all that bureaucracy that you were

302
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,880
talking about there, they wouldn't be happy with it unless they just don't know what's

303
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
going on.

304
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,820
I suppose if you sell it right, as you say, if you just say to them it's a small change.

305
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,520
It's a bit of a straw man's argument in my case, because what I'm really trying to say

306
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,640
is there is probably, what I'm trying to illustrate to you is there's really a large range of

307
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,600
businesses I think this would be beneficial to, large bureaucracies to small businesses

308
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,560
that can't just afford replacing infrastructure or setting up redundancies.

309
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,200
So I do think it has a broad appeal.

310
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,000
I even, as a home user, I kind of wonder, like maybe I'd want this on one of my systems

311
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,040
or maybe the system you and I are communicating over right now is an Ubuntu LTS system.

312
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,240
Maybe I should put it on this, because I don't often reboot this computer either.

313
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:19,040
But then if you have, say, eight, nine months of patches coming in and then the power goes

314
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:24,600
out and you start your system up again and you haven't tested a reboot, what happens

315
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
then?

316
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,600
What happens if something goes wrong?

317
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,360
You've got no idea which of the patches over the last nine months it was.

318
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,880
Well, I don't think it's quite as dramatic as that.

319
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,840
I think it's very selective fixes that go in.

320
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,960
And so you're not patching the user land.

321
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,280
You're not, I don't even know if you're revving the package of the kernel.

322
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,400
I'm not sure I should experiment with it to actually get a better understanding.

323
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,000
But I think there's still like app get update commands you would install that would be a

324
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,640
whole other set of updates that are separate from what you would get in the live patch.

325
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,640
The live patch is, I believe, things that are more critical, maybe remote vulnerabilities

326
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,200
or super critical local vulnerabilities that involve privilege escalation, something like

327
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
that.

328
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
I think it's pushed over live patch.

329
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,360
I think there's only been a few things pushed over live patch.

330
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,680
But again, this is just my rough understanding and lower critical vulnerabilities or user

331
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,680
land vulnerabilities are still patched via the traditional package management system.

332
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:26,240
But even a small server that's not doing too much, every time you do updates and you realize

333
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,880
you need to reboot it, are you telling me you don't get a little nervous feeling when

334
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,880
you reboot it?

335
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,880
Oh, sure.

336
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Yeah.

337
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,880
Even my desktop.

338
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
And that's part of the thrill.

339
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,880
I'm a bit of a thrill seeker, Joe.

340
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,880
Yeah.

341
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,400
I mean, if you've, as I say, if you've had nine months of patches, how much extra nervous

342
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,520
energy are you going to have when you reboot it finally for something else?

343
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,200
Yeah, I really should play with this, shouldn't I?

344
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,120
I should use this system as an experiment because I wonder how that works.

345
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,560
If you're live patching, and these are questions we could probably ask somebody at Canonical

346
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
too.

347
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,560
Maybe I'll do some digging.

348
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,320
If you're live patching, do they remain after reboot or do you have to install packages

349
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,400
for them to apply?

350
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,240
As far as I know, they do stay afterwards.

351
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,840
But yeah, we should double check that.

352
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,840
Yeah.

353
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,840
We should try.

354
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,720
And I don't know where I'll update you, but I'll update you somewhere.

355
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,720
Now this isn't the only way to keep your system secure.

356
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,520
If you are a big subscriber to the way Docker sees the world, they have Linux Kit, which

357
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,760
is a project that is incubating several technologies to advance Linux security.

358
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, they announced this back in April, but we didn't really learn that much about it

359
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,500
at the time.

360
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,800
And now more details are coming out.

361
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,520
And it looks like they're taking kernel security very, very seriously.

362
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,240
Yeah, I have a few thoughts about that.

363
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,400
I wonder if this isn't Docker trying to rebrand themselves very seriously as investing in security

364
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,160
because I think they've gotten a bit of a reputation for not taking security deeply

365
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
serious.

366
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,660
Well, there's kind of a meme, isn't there, that people download random Docker images

367
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,220
and then never update them and stuff.

368
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:00,040
And so you've got these insecure Docker images running left, right, and center.

369
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
There's that.

370
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,600
There's also the way that things were originally set up.

371
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,100
I don't think there was signing and whatnot that people gave them quite a bit of crap

372
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,100
for on the internet.

373
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,940
So I think maybe this could be somewhat of a response.

374
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,860
But either way, whatever the motivation is, it seems like the results could really be

375
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,160
great.

376
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,960
They have a series of projects.

377
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,080
Some of them, some of you out there probably have heard about.

378
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,220
We've covered WireGuard on Linux Unplugged before.

379
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,600
This is sort of a new VPN, partly built into the Linux kernel.

380
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,960
So it's very high performance, whereas OpenVPN is primarily in user space.

381
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,800
But it's also using a new type of cryptography.

382
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,440
It uses the noise protocol framework that WhatsApp uses.

383
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,840
So a lot of fans of WireGuard out there.

384
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,840
And it's pretty great to see Docker folks putting some effort and development behind

385
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
it.

386
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,200
Do you think their new attitude to security comes from the fact that they have got more

387
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,480
competition now?

388
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
Yes.

389
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Yes, I really do.

390
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,400
I think in part, they are trying to maintain their hold on this container space by really

391
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,400
being the builder of a platform for containers.

392
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,340
Now I've got to stop right here before we get all heady and start talking business terms

393
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,440
about containers.

394
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,480
Let's get real for a second.

395
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,140
Containers are commodity stuff here.

396
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,480
They're relying on technology that's built into the Linux kernel, their namespaces.

397
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,820
They're relying on technology either in system D or things that they bolt on.

398
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,520
But it's something that comes baked into the product now.

399
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,840
Everybody's Linux can do it.

400
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,760
So Docker doesn't have anything unique to bring to the market there because everybody's

401
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,040
got it.

402
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,820
But what they do have is all of the ecosystem and tools around it.

403
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:38,440
If they can be a platform provider where with Linux kit you can plug in your own components

404
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,960
but still have association with Docker or the Docker hub, then they're still in the

405
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,960
game.

406
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,900
Then they can add a real layer of value, quote unquote, that's what they like to call it,

407
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,200
to the container, quote unquote, space, which is otherwise just commodity software now built

408
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,200
into Linux.

409
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,520
But what about their branding problems?

410
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,000
You mean around Moby, their project to build your own Docker environment?

411
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm not sure.

412
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,880
I am still confused by Project Moby and all of it.

413
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,800
Yeah, you've got Docker, Moby, and Linux kit, which if you really dig into it, you can understand.

414
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:12,280
But I think a lot of people are struggling to understand where it all fits together.

415
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Yeah.

416
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,400
Out of all of it, Linux kit's the one I like the most because I like the fact that they're

417
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,120
throwing real development hours behind some important projects.

418
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,960
There's another one in here that I think's neat called Landlock, which is essentially

419
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,160
a competitor to SE Linux and AppArmor.

420
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,580
It's a quote unquote LSM, Joe, which stands for Linux Security Module, and it's being

421
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,160
incubated by Linux kit.

422
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,440
This Landlock one uses extended Berkeley packet filters to hook small programs into the Linux

423
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,440
kernel.

424
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,960
Do we really need another one?

425
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,480
Apparently we need one that's been designed for the container age, Joe.

426
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,840
We need one for the container age.

427
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,840
That's what they say.

428
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,520
I don't know if I'm convinced.

429
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Yeah.

430
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,680
Well, a Google developer has launched a kernel self-protection project in 2016, and now it's

431
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,920
being incubated by them.

432
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,520
I don't really understand what it does.

433
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,680
This one sounds pretty cool, though.

434
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,760
It's working on protections to help mitigate memory corruption risks.

435
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,240
Well, one undeniably good thing about this is they are committed to pushing all this

436
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,080
stuff upstream, so everyone's going to benefit from it.

437
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
Yeah.

438
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,360
Speaking of everyone benefiting, I think one of the most important open source projects

439
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,120
out there right now is the GNU PG project, and they have a fundraiser, a rally.

440
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:24,160
Yeah, rather than just one-off donations, they're looking for more of the kind of Patreon

441
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
style model.

442
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,600
They want people to donate a couple of bucks a month to keep the development going, which

443
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,520
is a good idea, really, because it's all well and good to raise big chunks of cash here

444
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,780
and there, but if you can just get a little bit coming in every month, then you've got

445
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:43,040
a much better idea of how you're going to balance your books and how many developers

446
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
you can employ.

447
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,040
Yeah, you can budget.

448
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Yeah, exactly.

449
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Budget.

450
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
That's the word.

451
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:52,120
Now, it's not something that I, to be honest, use that regularly.

452
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:58,240
I don't use it for my emails, but it's something that projects that I use use, if you know

453
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,240
what I mean.

454
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Yeah.

455
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,360
And they make a great case in here, too, that even if you don't personally use GNU PG, journalists

456
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,920
around the world right now are being trained on using GNU PG to communicate securely with

457
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,280
their sources.

458
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,440
That is massive.

459
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,800
If you just look at it from the activist, journalist, and lawyer's standpoint, it's

460
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,680
worth it even if you don't personally use it.

461
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:23,760
But I think right now, at this moment in time, it is a more valuable project than ever, and

462
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,120
there are multiple governments discussing getting backdoors to encryption, about the

463
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,520
going dark phenomenon, quote, unquote, that James Clapper was just quoted as saying last

464
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,300
week.

465
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,980
There is an active effort to pressure encryption manufacturers or whatever the term they're

466
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,580
going to use, they're going to come up with some term to give governments backdoor access.

467
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:47,480
That means open source projects like GNU PG are going to be under more pressure than ever

468
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,920
and more important than ever.

469
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,200
And they have modest goals here.

470
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,700
Their primary goal is to fully fund three developers.

471
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,080
And they're looking for 15,000 euros per month, which seems a little low to me for three developers,

472
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,400
but that's going by the standards here in the States.

473
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,280
They say their stretch goal is twice that, 30 euros, 30,000 euros per month.

474
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:17,240
Again, that's like here in the States, that'd be like maybe 400,000, 420,000 a year to pay

475
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,640
for three developers.

476
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,120
That would pay for maybe two developers here in Washington, depending on their position.

477
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,920
I mean, when you're working on something like GNU PG, these are not beginner jobs.

478
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
Yeah, this isn't a bit of Python, is it?

479
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,160
This is some serious stuff.

480
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,720
I honestly would have liked to see them put these numbers higher because I think they

481
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,800
deserve this work and it's one of the most vital, vital open source projects right now.

482
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
It's my personal opinion.

483
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,480
This is more important than ever.

484
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,240
And so you can go to GNU PG.org slash donate if you'd like to get in on the rally.

485
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,740
I hope they make it.

486
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:53,000
It seems like a pretty worthwhile project.

487
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah, yeah.

488
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Fingers crossed.

489
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
All right.

490
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,240
Well, that brings us to the end of this week's show.
