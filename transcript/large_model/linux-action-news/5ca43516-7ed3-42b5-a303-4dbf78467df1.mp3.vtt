00:00.000 --> 00:10.200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 129, recorded on October 27, 2019.

00:10.200 --> 00:11.200
I'm Chris.

00:11.200 --> 00:12.200
And I'm Drew.

00:12.200 --> 00:13.280
Well, hello, Drew.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.920
That wasn't the plan, was it?

00:14.920 --> 00:15.920
No.

00:15.920 --> 00:20.920
Turns out Joe has a little illness going on and he won't be joining today.

00:20.920 --> 00:26.040
Some con cred, as it always happens when you travel to events in the winter.

00:26.040 --> 00:31.080
So we wish him a quick recovery, and in the meantime, we kick things off with really great

00:31.080 --> 00:33.700
news out of the GNOME Foundation.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.800
They're taking the fight to the patent troll.

00:35.800 --> 00:40.300
They've filed defense against the patent troll going after Shotwell.

00:40.300 --> 00:41.600
That's absolutely right.

00:41.600 --> 00:46.000
And just as a reminder to everybody, they are being sued for patent infringement by

00:46.000 --> 00:48.320
Rothschild Patent Imaging LLC.

00:48.320 --> 00:50.080
Yeah, they need the money.

00:50.080 --> 00:51.080
Everybody knows that.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.080
Right.

00:52.080 --> 00:53.080
Of course.

00:53.080 --> 00:59.440
But Rothschild did offer them a settlement offer for somewhere high in the five figures,

00:59.440 --> 01:00.880
but GNOME actually turned it down.

01:00.880 --> 01:03.260
This is the part that really kind of gets me fired up.

01:03.260 --> 01:06.600
And I'm really grateful for the GNOME Foundation here.

01:06.600 --> 01:11.320
They write on their blog, quote, this would have been simple to do so, i.e. accept that

01:11.320 --> 01:13.560
compromise.

01:13.560 --> 01:18.600
But they go on to say, it would have caused less work, it would have cost us less money,

01:18.600 --> 01:21.920
and it would have provided the foundation a lot less stress.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.560
But it also would be wrong.

01:24.560 --> 01:29.880
Agreeing to this would leave the patent live and allow it to be used as a weapon against

01:29.880 --> 01:31.520
countless others.

01:31.520 --> 01:36.400
They conclude by saying, we will stand firm against this baseless attack, not just for

01:36.400 --> 01:40.840
GNOME and Shotwell, but for all free and open source software projects.

01:40.840 --> 01:41.840
Yes.

01:41.840 --> 01:47.980
And I think this is really the right move and is a good example to set for the free

01:47.980 --> 01:49.840
software community in general.

01:49.840 --> 01:55.840
Now granted, not everybody has the kind of pull and weight that the GNOME Foundation

01:55.840 --> 01:58.360
has to be able to fight this sort of thing.

01:58.360 --> 02:02.360
But since they do, they're doing the right thing here.

02:02.360 --> 02:06.520
Well, I think that's why it's important that they are the ones to take this fight on.

02:06.520 --> 02:10.160
I don't know how much weight and pull they do have.

02:10.160 --> 02:13.520
And I think that's why it's important that when we talk about these things, we mentioned

02:13.520 --> 02:17.600
they have set up a legal fund, not just for this, but future fights as well.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.960
The software conservancy is getting behind them like there is things lining up, but it's

02:20.960 --> 02:24.240
not a sure thing yet.

02:24.240 --> 02:28.840
And we really want to see this thing succeed because if the GNOME Foundation, heaven forbid,

02:28.840 --> 02:35.500
were to fail, this Rothschild patent imaging sham LLC would be emboldened to move forward.

02:35.500 --> 02:40.260
They started with barbecue restaurants and small little chains in Florida, and now they're

02:40.260 --> 02:45.600
moving on to the internet and going after anything that uses this vaguely defined image

02:45.600 --> 02:48.080
transfer metadata patent.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.880
It's weak on the very grounds.

02:49.880 --> 02:54.520
So there's a good shot here that the GNOME Foundation can win this fight, but they have

02:54.520 --> 02:58.220
to have the finances, they have to have the backing to do it.

02:58.220 --> 03:01.800
And so that's why I feel like anytime we talk about this, we're going to put a link in the

03:01.800 --> 03:06.060
show notes for the Patent Troll Defense Fund because it's not just for GNOME, it's not

03:06.060 --> 03:10.500
just for Shotwell, it's for future open source projects because it will not stop here if

03:10.500 --> 03:12.000
this patent troll wins.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.180
And the way that the GNOME Foundation is fighting this is Neil McGovern has instructed their

03:16.180 --> 03:21.000
legal counsel at Sherman and Sterling to file the following papers, a motion to dismiss the

03:21.000 --> 03:25.760
patent outright as invalid, an answer to the claim, which they don't even think that they

03:25.760 --> 03:30.760
should have to file but are filing anyways, stating that Shotwell and Free Software in

03:30.760 --> 03:36.880
general is not even affected by this patent, as well as a counterclaim just in case Rothschild

03:36.880 --> 03:41.280
tries to drop the suit once they see that the GNOME Foundation is going to fight it.

03:41.280 --> 03:45.680
I love this because what they've done here is they've recognized that these people didn't

03:45.680 --> 03:49.120
do their homework properly and they don't even have a valid case here.

03:49.120 --> 03:53.960
So this third, this counterclaim, this third paper they've filed to make sure they can't

03:53.960 --> 03:57.480
just tuck and roll and try to get out of this and then go after somebody who doesn't do

03:57.480 --> 04:02.440
their homework is the masterstroke of this procedure.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.440
It really shows you that they've been thinking about this.

04:05.440 --> 04:08.380
And also, it sends a signal.

04:08.380 --> 04:14.200
It sends a signal to this horrible, twisted patent troll marketplace that you just can't

04:14.200 --> 04:19.160
go after free software like this, that these foundations will seek legal counsel and they'll

04:19.160 --> 04:20.760
go after you for it.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.440
They'll hold you to the fire.

04:22.440 --> 04:27.600
Yes, and the GNOME Foundation even goes so far as to say, we want to send a message to

04:27.600 --> 04:29.560
all software patent trolls out there.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.840
We will fight your suit.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.120
We will win.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.640
And we will have your patent invalidated.

04:33.640 --> 04:38.480
Well, I'm happy to say they are making good progress to their goal of 125,000.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.520
I suspect they're going to need a lot more than that.

04:40.520 --> 04:48.040
But so far, as we record this episode of Linux Action News, they have raised 80,000 US greenbacks

04:48.040 --> 04:50.400
and they're close to tipping to 81,000.

04:50.400 --> 04:51.960
So we'll put a link in the show notes again.

04:51.960 --> 04:54.040
I think this is something that matters a lot.

04:54.040 --> 04:57.160
And maybe we can get them to that goal of 125.

04:57.160 --> 04:58.160
I'm looking at this.

04:58.160 --> 05:02.480
I'm thinking there's no, you can't, you can't do this for $125,000.

05:02.480 --> 05:03.720
But this is a good start.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.160
So let's get them to at least that goal.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.380
Yes, absolutely.

05:07.380 --> 05:09.760
And also throwing a little bit of weight behind them.

05:09.760 --> 05:15.420
You've also got the Software Freedom Conservancy, Debian and the Document Foundation, all pledging

05:15.420 --> 05:20.120
to stand with the GNOME Foundation, which I think is great as a show of support.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.080
Well, I think Will Cook has our support.

05:22.080 --> 05:28.160
He was the director of engineering for the Ubuntu desktop, but he has left Canonical.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.160
That's right.

05:29.160 --> 05:34.560
He's moving over to InfluxDB, which is an open source time series database solution.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.520
And Martin Wimperis is going to be taking over his spot.

05:37.520 --> 05:41.720
Yeah, that's great for Will and it's also really great for Wimpy.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.760
I can't think of anyone better to take on this new role.

05:44.760 --> 05:48.600
And I think it'd be nice to kind of look back over some of the things that Will accomplished

05:48.600 --> 05:53.760
because the last five years of the Ubuntu desktop have been some of the most significant

05:53.760 --> 05:55.480
change we've witnessed.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.480
Absolutely.

05:56.480 --> 06:02.120
They have really come out of the gate strong with all of those releases.

06:02.120 --> 06:06.760
And that was after some would say a little bit of a slump in quality.

06:06.760 --> 06:13.480
I think Will really brought Ubuntu up to where it needed to be.

06:13.480 --> 06:19.320
And the last few releases especially have just been of exceptional quality, if you ask

06:19.320 --> 06:20.320
me.

06:20.320 --> 06:23.020
There was a couple of pivotal moments for Will under his leadership of the Ubuntu desktop

06:23.020 --> 06:24.540
that I recognized.

06:24.540 --> 06:28.280
Number one was he opened up a dialogue with the wider community.

06:28.280 --> 06:32.720
He kind of stepped outside the Linux bubble and said, what do you want in a Linux desktop?

06:32.720 --> 06:36.360
And a lot of them came back with, we want the GNOME shell.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.000
We want sane defaults.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.440
We want this, that and the other thing.

06:40.440 --> 06:44.760
And then he took that data and he went to Mark Shuttleworth and the whole team had a

06:44.760 --> 06:49.800
conversation and we saw the announcement that they'd be transitioning from Unity to GNOME

06:49.800 --> 06:55.440
shell, that they'd be essentially implementing all of these highly requested things that

06:55.440 --> 06:57.120
the community wanted.

06:57.120 --> 07:02.080
And he was there during that transition, but not only that, he was there during the investment

07:02.080 --> 07:08.520
into GNOME shell to make it so smooth, so much more stable, so much more professional

07:08.520 --> 07:11.200
grade than it was at the time they adopted it.

07:11.200 --> 07:16.220
All of the changes that they have made in the past few months even have been pushing

07:16.220 --> 07:20.640
GNOME way farther than I thought possible.

07:20.640 --> 07:26.120
It has become such a great experience and such a joy to use that I think it's actually

07:26.120 --> 07:28.600
starting to win a lot of people back.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.620
I think I like the way this is being done.

07:30.620 --> 07:32.300
The 1910 release got out.

07:32.300 --> 07:36.040
It was a solid feature packed release.

07:36.040 --> 07:40.720
And now Will's doing a nice transition and a handoff here.

07:40.720 --> 07:44.940
He sought through some of the most challenging times of the distribution and got it to this

07:44.940 --> 07:49.040
point where it's better than it's been, I mean, probably ever.

07:49.040 --> 07:53.000
It's legitimately probably the best desktop they've ever shipped.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.980
And we've been able to say that now for, like you mentioned, a few releases.

07:55.980 --> 07:59.060
It's just been progressively getting better and better.

07:59.060 --> 08:03.240
At the same time, that doesn't mean that we don't need to change things up a bit.

08:03.240 --> 08:08.240
If you look at where they're going, they're going in a direction that's more professional

08:08.240 --> 08:09.240
grade.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.240
It's a development workstation.

08:10.240 --> 08:14.540
They're working more with OEMs like Dell and they're taking their input and they're really

08:14.540 --> 08:16.360
focusing the product.

08:16.360 --> 08:23.240
At the same time, Microsoft is a big part of the story now, not only just with Azure,

08:23.240 --> 08:26.480
but also with the Windows subsystem for Linux.

08:26.480 --> 08:30.200
And that is something that Canonical is starting to take more seriously.

08:30.200 --> 08:35.720
We may see that develop into its own official branch of the Ubuntu project.

08:35.720 --> 08:40.100
And I think it's interesting as Wimpy takes on this desktop lead role, he's not just taking

08:40.100 --> 08:45.600
that on, but he's also taking on the management for the Windows subsystem for the Linux.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.760
Canonical is internalizing that.

08:47.760 --> 08:52.580
And I think it shows not just a recognition that that's a legitimate platform, but it's

08:52.580 --> 08:59.640
truly a recognition of how important the developer is for the Ubuntu platform and specifically

08:59.640 --> 09:01.600
the Ubuntu desktop.

09:01.600 --> 09:04.400
And that's why I think this is the perfect timing.

09:04.400 --> 09:09.320
It will really turn this thing around and now Wimpy can take it and bring it to that

09:09.320 --> 09:10.840
next phase.

09:10.840 --> 09:16.520
And he may be one of the most uniquely positioned people, not just at Canonical, but in the

09:16.520 --> 09:18.720
open source community to pull it off.

09:18.720 --> 09:20.400
I completely agree.

09:20.400 --> 09:28.320
He is definitely a person who has the leadership skills and the engineering background to really

09:28.320 --> 09:29.320
do this.

09:29.320 --> 09:36.080
Between his work with the MATE desktop and being so focused on SnapCraft and packaging

09:36.080 --> 09:42.920
formats, he really knows what it takes to get something off the ground like this.

09:42.920 --> 09:49.440
And he's also excellent at taking user feedback and implementing it into his work.

09:49.440 --> 09:53.800
I really can't think of anybody else who would be better suited to this position right now.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.800
Yeah.

09:54.800 --> 09:59.720
So just a big congratulations to both Will and Wimpy from the team here at Jupiter Broadcasting.

09:59.720 --> 10:03.840
And I think it's just going to make for a better product for end users.

10:03.840 --> 10:10.400
So really just pretty happy all around about this and look forward to 2004.

10:10.400 --> 10:13.140
It better be good now.

10:13.140 --> 10:17.760
If he doesn't knock this out of the park, he's got five years to live it down.

10:17.760 --> 10:18.760
It's true though.

10:18.760 --> 10:19.760
Oh man.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.240
At the same time, I'm super excited for him.

10:21.240 --> 10:26.400
But then when I think about that, I'm like, oh, that's a tough spot to be in.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.960
Well Firefox has some new features.

10:28.960 --> 10:34.080
Keep an eye out for version 70 because when it lands, some new features come front and

10:34.080 --> 10:37.040
center to tell you just what a good job it's doing.

10:37.040 --> 10:40.320
I've actually already got this on my desktop.

10:40.320 --> 10:44.240
It landed for me today in the Fedora repos.

10:44.240 --> 10:47.600
And honestly, the new panel is really slick.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.400
It is so good looking.

10:49.400 --> 10:53.600
Yeah, I mean, really, this is one of the things I think that makes PyHole such a great project

10:53.600 --> 10:58.920
is you get these great, nice looking visualizations of all of the hard work it's doing for you

10:58.920 --> 11:01.080
and it kind of makes it click.

11:01.080 --> 11:04.400
It really is actually actively protecting you.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.400
Right.

11:05.400 --> 11:09.940
So not only is it showing you the metrics of how many trackers it's blocking, but it

11:09.940 --> 11:16.280
also integrates with lockwise as well as Firefox monitor to show you not just your password

11:16.280 --> 11:21.580
statistics, but also if you've set up monitor with your email address, it will even show

11:21.580 --> 11:27.700
you how many breaches your email address has been involved in directly in that same panel.

11:27.700 --> 11:31.520
And my understanding is it will flag future breaches as well.

11:31.520 --> 11:37.660
So they have an analogy here that kind of actually works, but you'll have to just sort

11:37.660 --> 11:38.820
of be a little forgiving.

11:38.820 --> 11:43.840
They say, in some ways, a browser is like a car where the engine drives you to the places

11:43.840 --> 11:48.800
you want to go and a dashboard tells you the basics, like how fast you're going or whether

11:48.800 --> 11:50.520
you need gas.

11:50.520 --> 11:54.740
But just like the car dashboard these days, it's telling you more and more.

11:54.740 --> 11:57.400
And so they sort of see the browser is playing this role.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.360
They want to bring three key things to the surface.

12:00.360 --> 12:04.200
They want you to see how many times enhanced tracking protection has blocked an attempt

12:04.200 --> 12:06.100
to tag you with a cookie.

12:06.100 --> 12:10.760
They also want you to be aware of any potential future data breaches like we were just talking

12:10.760 --> 12:11.760
about.

12:11.760 --> 12:16.720
That's the Firefox monitor that works in conjunction with the have I been pwned database.

12:16.720 --> 12:21.760
And then lastly, they really want you to consider using lockwise, manage your passwords and

12:21.760 --> 12:23.660
sync them across your devices.

12:23.660 --> 12:28.080
You get a brief idea of how many passwords you have, you get an overview of if they're

12:28.080 --> 12:30.160
like complicated enough.

12:30.160 --> 12:34.940
And in theory, you can work in conjunction with Firefox monitor to flag you and tell

12:34.940 --> 12:39.240
you, hey, hey, you're using passwords that are on the public internet.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.540
You better change those.

12:40.540 --> 12:44.440
It also has some nice features for generating passwords.

12:44.440 --> 12:50.720
So when you will go to sign up for a website or go to refresh a password, it will actually

12:50.720 --> 12:55.520
prompt you to ask you, hey, do you want to go ahead and create a randomized password

12:55.520 --> 13:00.340
for this and have me store it for you, which I think is a really killer feature and helps

13:00.340 --> 13:03.440
people to remember that it's there and that they should be using it.

13:03.440 --> 13:04.440
Well, yeah.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.960
I mean, anybody listening to this goes, well, you know, bit warden or last pass or insert

13:07.960 --> 13:10.760
name of password manager that does that for me already.

13:10.760 --> 13:12.000
Well, good job.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
You.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
Yeah, you've done a good job.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
You've got a password manager.

13:15.000 --> 13:19.680
Turns out, though, the rest of the world hasn't really caught up yet, unfortunately.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.800
And so this is sort of bringing it to the masses.

13:21.800 --> 13:22.800
I like that about it.

13:22.800 --> 13:31.300
But I think really, if you were to take one thing away from version 70 is the data visualization.

13:31.300 --> 13:37.040
It really just shows you in a very kind of understandable, readable way how fricking

13:37.040 --> 13:42.080
bad the web is, you know, like, holy crap, like, and I've been running this, too.

13:42.080 --> 13:47.000
I also got the same update you did just just for my morning prep for the show.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.080
And I'm I'm in the hundreds already.

13:49.080 --> 13:50.200
Oh, absolutely.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.600
The news sites are almost the worst in some cases.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.600
Yeah.

13:53.600 --> 13:57.760
I mean, they want to connect to Facebook, which thankfully, Firefox is already blocking

13:57.760 --> 14:03.920
due to its Facebook container ization, which I love also, you know, they want to pull your

14:03.920 --> 14:09.460
Google Analytics, they want to pull your Twitter traffic, they want to they want to pull everything

14:09.460 --> 14:11.960
about you that they can.

14:11.960 --> 14:18.160
And not only can that slow the pages down, it's also, you know, a little privacy invading.

14:18.160 --> 14:25.640
Kind of tangentially related to this, there was some further details on Firefox's DNS

14:25.640 --> 14:28.120
over HTTPS implementation.

14:28.120 --> 14:32.240
And I think in an attempt to sort of alleviate some concerns around Cloudflare primarily.

14:32.240 --> 14:37.840
Yes, for one, they are coming right out and saying, we are not entering into any kind

14:37.840 --> 14:40.480
of financial agreement with Cloudflare.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.280
None of this has anything to do with any money.

14:43.280 --> 14:48.400
Beyond that, Cloudflare has also signed a contract that states that they are meeting

14:48.400 --> 14:52.360
the privacy requirements that Firefox has set forth.

14:52.360 --> 14:59.040
And they've agreed that neither party is allowed to make money by monetizing the data pulled

14:59.040 --> 15:01.120
from any DNS requests.

15:01.120 --> 15:07.240
So overall, I think that they are doing a pretty good job to alleviate the concerns.

15:07.240 --> 15:14.860
Now I think a lot of people are still going to be really wary of Cloudflare in specific.

15:14.860 --> 15:19.440
But Mozilla has also stated that they're working with more resolvers to try and get them to

15:19.440 --> 15:24.280
sign that same contract that Cloudflare signed and get them into their trusted recursive

15:24.280 --> 15:25.600
resolver program.

15:25.600 --> 15:29.760
I think that would be a very good move on their part that would do substantially more

15:29.760 --> 15:34.340
to alleviate people's concerns than just sort of reiterating what we kind of already knew

15:34.340 --> 15:36.320
about their Cloudflare agreement.

15:36.320 --> 15:41.480
Granted, some of this is new details, but a lot of this was sort of implied through

15:41.480 --> 15:44.320
Mozilla's blogs already.

15:44.320 --> 15:51.520
And I think what we see happening to Cloudflare is both good and also unfortunate.

15:51.520 --> 15:59.040
I think the community is taking all of the bad lessons learned about Google and all of

15:59.040 --> 16:02.760
the great things Google said about doing no evil and all of that, and they're taking all

16:02.760 --> 16:07.720
of it, internalizing that and just preemptively applying it to Cloudflare before they even

16:07.720 --> 16:11.800
get to the position to abuse power.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.400
People are sick of it.

16:13.400 --> 16:19.040
At the same time, I think it's a good thing because lesson learned, good on us.

16:19.040 --> 16:21.080
We won't be fooled twice.

16:21.080 --> 16:26.560
But it's unfortunate because Cloudflare is not Google, and they have not done the same

16:26.560 --> 16:28.400
things that Google has done.

16:28.400 --> 16:32.740
And we should judge each in their own based on their own actions.

16:32.740 --> 16:37.520
And if we were to go by the actions here, it would seem that Cloudflare is really playing

16:37.520 --> 16:43.440
ball with Mozilla from the complying with their privacy standards to no financial transactions

16:43.440 --> 16:45.240
involved with this.

16:45.240 --> 16:48.960
There's no monetizing of data that's in the agreement.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.220
All of that really should be satisfying most of us.

16:51.220 --> 16:55.480
That's a pretty unprecedented level of agreement that you don't typically see with these kinds

16:55.480 --> 17:00.320
of companies, and Mozilla should be recognized for achieving that.

17:00.320 --> 17:05.920
But it hasn't really satiated that overall concern that I think has been baked into us

17:05.920 --> 17:08.120
from companies like Google and probably Facebook.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.800
Yeah, I think you're right.

17:09.800 --> 17:17.480
But let's move on to a little bit of the technical details about how they're utilizing DOH.

17:17.480 --> 17:25.720
For one, if DOH fails, it will drop back to standard basic DNS to fulfill a query.

17:25.720 --> 17:32.180
So it's not like DOH is just going to start breaking things left and right.

17:32.180 --> 17:38.400
And beyond that, they're also providing a method for sites to state, hey, we don't work

17:38.400 --> 17:39.400
with DOH.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.320
DOH breaks our functionality.

17:41.320 --> 17:46.160
Can you please fall back to DNS before even trying DOH?

17:46.160 --> 17:51.860
So sites can actually break out of that and say, no, no, no, we don't want DOH.

17:51.860 --> 17:56.400
Please give us standard DNS, and Firefox will attempt to accommodate that.

17:56.400 --> 18:02.840
And some other use cases involving that same strategy are things like parental controls.

18:02.840 --> 18:09.400
So if you're using something like Umbrella or some other kind of parental DNS overlay,

18:09.400 --> 18:14.520
Firefox should automatically detect it by using a canary domain and then fall back to

18:14.520 --> 18:21.760
standard DNS because clearly you have made a decision to use something to implement parental

18:21.760 --> 18:23.160
controls.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.120
Same thing with enterprise policies.

18:25.120 --> 18:30.440
If it detects enterprise policies, again, it will automatically disable DOH and fall

18:30.440 --> 18:37.500
back to standard DNS so as not to break your enterprise local DNS settings, which I think

18:37.500 --> 18:41.080
all of those are the right move, especially coming out the gate.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.400
Yeah, those don't sound bad.

18:42.400 --> 18:50.000
I think in particular, all of those will come down to let's see it in action because auto-detecting

18:50.000 --> 18:56.880
based on a canary list is useful, but it's sort of like antivirus that's only based on

18:56.880 --> 18:58.440
pattern detection.

18:58.440 --> 19:02.920
You only will be able to detect the known things, and if somebody stands up a new project

19:02.920 --> 19:08.880
or somebody creates their own system for their LAN, it may or may not detect those things.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.560
We'll just have to wait and see.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.620
It perhaps will accommodate, but we don't know.

19:13.620 --> 19:22.040
I have been using DOH in my day-to-day usage for months, maybe month and a half, two months,

19:22.040 --> 19:26.800
essentially since we started talking about it regularly here on the show, and it's been

19:26.800 --> 19:29.680
unnotable.

19:29.680 --> 19:34.720
It wasn't until I recently had an issue where my PyHole box was blocking some domains, at

19:34.720 --> 19:40.280
least I suspect that was happening, and I couldn't resolve them, and I didn't know why,

19:40.280 --> 19:44.400
and so I turned on DOH and it started working.

19:44.400 --> 19:50.320
Now that would seem to indicate to me that Firefox's DOH implementation failed to auto-detect

19:50.320 --> 19:56.000
that I was using PyHole intentionally and still let me resolve those sites, which yay

19:56.000 --> 20:01.080
for me, I wanted to get to those sites, but doesn't seem to speak well for the overall

20:01.080 --> 20:02.600
implementation.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.320
Perhaps it is yet to be fully implemented.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.560
Well and they do have a kill switch too.

20:07.560 --> 20:13.440
So if you're an administrator and you're rolling out say like Firefox to an enterprise, you

20:13.440 --> 20:19.760
can go ahead and preemptively disable it in about config, and if you're a general user,

20:19.760 --> 20:25.840
you can manually disable it in the browser under the preferences by going to the network

20:25.840 --> 20:32.360
settings under general, and there's a really easy checkbox, enable or disable DOH right

20:32.360 --> 20:36.560
there, and it will let you pick your provider, granted there's only one right now, but the

20:36.560 --> 20:38.760
functionality is already there to change.

20:38.760 --> 20:42.400
Yeah, there's only one now, and that's how I turned it on.

20:42.400 --> 20:49.840
I opted in so that way I could have some experience when I talk about this on air, because I do

20:49.840 --> 20:51.360
manage DNS.

20:51.360 --> 20:56.440
I use DNS very intentionally on my LAN and I want that to work when I want to connect

20:56.440 --> 20:59.160
to a local box, I just want to use its friendly name.

20:59.160 --> 21:05.860
So I've been trying it out and I like to try to hold the two things separately.

21:05.860 --> 21:11.680
There's the technology implementation and then there's the policies and politics around

21:11.680 --> 21:16.960
the implementation, the avoiding surveillance, all of the other things like perhaps cloud

21:16.960 --> 21:17.960
flares issues.

21:17.960 --> 21:21.920
There are two separate issues, the tech and the politics, and as far as I'm concerned,

21:21.920 --> 21:28.240
the tech is useful, and so as long as I can continue to run my own DOH servers and I can

21:28.240 --> 21:32.480
choose my own provider or add my own custom entry or turn it on or turn it off, I say

21:32.480 --> 21:37.440
it's a great thing to have in the browser, because there are situations where your local

21:37.440 --> 21:46.840
DNS sucks, and having reliable, fast, secure, signed DNS is a good thing, and you could

21:46.840 --> 21:51.080
just go turn it on with a single freaking checkbox and you can turn it off with another

21:51.080 --> 21:55.480
click of that same freaking checkbox, and I think that makes it a good thing in my book.

21:55.480 --> 22:01.960
Well one thing that you can opt out of, at least for now, is GitLab Telemetry.

22:01.960 --> 22:07.360
They announced recently that they were going to start adding JavaScript-based code that

22:07.360 --> 22:13.200
would run in a user's browser to pull telemetry data and submit it back up to GitLab via a

22:13.200 --> 22:19.920
third-party platform called Pendo, but they're backtracking a bit on this.

22:19.920 --> 22:26.100
This is a fascinating story, and when you read their original post, at least what remains

22:26.100 --> 22:33.000
of it, you can tell they're really kind of approaching this from a very trepidatious

22:33.000 --> 22:34.600
standpoint.

22:34.600 --> 22:38.080
This is an ugly truth of software as a service.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.540
You need data.

22:39.540 --> 22:40.540
You need metrics.

22:40.540 --> 22:45.160
You need to know what parts of your platform you're losing people, what parts of your platform

22:45.160 --> 22:51.560
are the best, and where you can improve or fix things in between, and without metrics

22:51.560 --> 22:56.440
of what your users are clicking on, how long they're spending in areas, where they bail,

22:56.440 --> 23:01.440
where the transaction fails, without those metrics, you don't know where to improve.

23:01.440 --> 23:07.000
You build something, you get thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of users in some cases,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.840
and then you're blind as to what they're doing on the platform.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.600
Imagine that scenario.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.640
That sounds frightening.

23:12.640 --> 23:19.320
You'd just be guessing, going by instinct, well I feel like we ought to improve this.

23:19.320 --> 23:23.960
This is essentially the situation GitLab found themselves in, and so they thought, well,

23:23.960 --> 23:24.960
let's think about this.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.240
Let's be real reasonable here.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.720
I know what we'll do.

23:27.720 --> 23:33.840
We'll get more data on how users are using GitLab, and they had a nice plan.

23:33.840 --> 23:37.640
They do something real minor, just a little JavaScript snippet like Drew said, something

23:37.640 --> 23:38.640
real simple.

23:38.640 --> 23:43.400
They'd be real transparent about it in their privacy statement, and they may also put it

23:43.400 --> 23:48.320
out in different versions of GitLab, just so they get that data as well, but don't worry.

23:48.320 --> 23:52.760
If you turn on Do Not Track, we'll respect it, and it's all going to be fine.

23:52.760 --> 23:58.400
Well, like so many things like this, the internet didn't respond so well, and there may have

23:58.400 --> 24:03.680
been some parts of this official post that got removed later on too, which is a little

24:03.680 --> 24:04.680
suspicious.

24:04.680 --> 24:10.000
Including impressive financial results for our shareholders was the piece that got removed.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.840
Now I want to give you the context here because it's important.

24:13.840 --> 24:20.480
The original line read, on one hand, we value results, including impressive financial results

24:20.480 --> 24:26.600
for our shareholders, and we believe an open core model is the best path to achieve that.

24:26.600 --> 24:32.040
It also means making our products better as fast as possible for our customers and users.

24:32.040 --> 24:37.920
Now what's important there is that they're pulling out that information about wanting

24:37.920 --> 24:45.280
to provide financial results, which essentially reads as, we're going to monetize this data

24:45.280 --> 24:49.260
that we are pulling out of your browser.

24:49.260 --> 24:50.260
Not a good look.

24:50.260 --> 24:53.500
No, I think that's not what they intended.

24:53.500 --> 25:00.760
What they, I assume, were trying to convey was almost like this triumphant, we're going

25:00.760 --> 25:07.320
to give impressive results to our shareholders because of our open core approach.

25:07.320 --> 25:12.560
Our open core approach will bring them great dividends, and that's an important metric

25:12.560 --> 25:16.840
for us because open source making money is important to us.

25:16.840 --> 25:22.760
I think that was the intention of the statement, but man does it not read like that at all.

25:22.760 --> 25:25.600
Oh yeah, I totally agree.

25:25.600 --> 25:31.400
I think this is essentially them saying through improvements to the product, we're going to

25:31.400 --> 25:39.800
have more users and show better return on our professional paid product, but whoever

25:39.800 --> 25:43.960
wrote this copy made a whoopsie.

25:43.960 --> 25:46.520
I think they were trying to be bold.

25:46.520 --> 25:51.640
Also you could interpret that as impressive financial results equals sustainability, which

25:51.640 --> 25:56.160
is important for a product like this in the developer ecosystem.

25:56.160 --> 26:03.120
I kind of understand the somewhat backwards logic that led to that line being in there,

26:03.120 --> 26:05.420
but imagine Drew as well.

26:05.420 --> 26:09.860
This was proofread by a handful, at least maybe even a dozen people.

26:09.860 --> 26:15.440
This wasn't just something a guy wrote up and then posted on the web.

26:15.440 --> 26:19.380
This is something that they really as a group thought, yeah, this is the way to get this

26:19.380 --> 26:23.200
message across that open core and open source can make money.

26:23.200 --> 26:30.840
The whole situation just looks bad and then to back out of the data collection both doesn't

26:30.840 --> 26:35.760
really solve the problem and also just punts it down the road and they'll have to get back

26:35.760 --> 26:36.760
to this at some point.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.200
They do need these metrics.

26:39.200 --> 26:43.880
They really should just come up with a way to bake them in that isn't offensive to the

26:43.880 --> 26:49.840
end users and I couldn't tell them how to do that, but when you read their post, I read

26:49.840 --> 26:54.440
something that comes across as trepidatious, lots of couching, lots of telling you why

26:54.440 --> 26:58.300
this is the best scenario that they've come to and how they're going to try to do it right

26:58.300 --> 27:04.200
and how they're going to try to be transparent and then you give it a few days and they immediately

27:04.200 --> 27:06.720
turn around and they say, okay, we're not going to do it.

27:06.720 --> 27:10.120
I mean, we're going to do it, but we're not going to do it right now.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.520
We're going to give it a rethink.

27:12.520 --> 27:18.220
They even mentioned that a lot of the pushback was because some of the code that would be

27:18.220 --> 27:23.320
running in users' browsers is closed source and the reason for that is a lot of these

27:23.320 --> 27:29.840
third-party telemetry scripts, like the really good professional ones, are proprietary and

27:29.840 --> 27:35.360
using software as a service rather than something that they would bake into their site in order

27:35.360 --> 27:39.960
to save some money, save some engineering time, they'd probably have to hire somebody

27:39.960 --> 27:43.060
to do that particular work.

27:43.060 --> 27:48.560
It makes sense from a business perspective to go ahead and outsource that, but I mean,

27:48.560 --> 27:53.160
especially when you're talking about a community that writes source code and shares source

27:53.160 --> 27:59.760
code, they're not super into having closed source code run in their browser.

27:59.760 --> 28:04.600
I also don't think GitLab needs to participate in these chickenshit closed source tracking

28:04.600 --> 28:11.640
systems that are designed to create bogus stats for an industry that lives off of hype.

28:11.640 --> 28:12.960
They don't need to play that game.

28:12.960 --> 28:20.420
They can write their own checks and I suspect that this was the result of trying to achieve

28:20.420 --> 28:25.800
a certain set of goals about trying to reach certain metrics in performance, in stability,

28:25.800 --> 28:31.960
in bug fixing, and in financial performance and after the group got together and had a

28:31.960 --> 28:38.480
nice good group think on it, this was their solution to solve that problem and now this

28:38.480 --> 28:43.080
has put a big red flag up and now they're going to, as a group, have to rethink it and

28:43.080 --> 28:46.720
I would bet you their second take on this is going to be much more palatable.

28:46.720 --> 28:49.120
Well I hope so because I like the GitLab project.

28:49.120 --> 28:54.620
I think it's a good project and I think it's got some legs, but I would be remiss if I

28:54.620 --> 29:01.280
didn't bring up, hey, this is like a month after they announced a $268 million Series

29:01.280 --> 29:03.680
E round of funding.

29:03.680 --> 29:06.280
It's got to be at least partially connected to that.

29:06.280 --> 29:10.160
Yeah, that is a little bit coincidental.

29:10.160 --> 29:13.480
On their blog they write, our plans for the funding are straightforward.

29:13.480 --> 29:17.940
GitLab will invest to make all of our DevOps platform offerings, including monitoring security

29:17.940 --> 29:23.080
and planning, best in class so we can enable our enterprise customers continue to bring

29:23.080 --> 29:25.480
products to the market faster.

29:25.480 --> 29:27.260
That's a great goal.

29:27.260 --> 29:30.600
How do they know where their product is currently lacking?

29:30.600 --> 29:35.480
How do you make it best in class without data telling you where the problems are?

29:35.480 --> 29:39.640
Where as they might say in the biz, the friction is.

29:39.640 --> 29:46.160
Without the ability to identify that friction and lower that friction, they can't make it

29:46.160 --> 29:47.840
the best in class.

29:47.840 --> 29:55.280
You can easily see how you go from, well we've just taken on $268 million in Series E funding,

29:55.280 --> 29:58.900
all of these A, B, C, D and E funders want data.

29:58.900 --> 30:00.940
We want to be best in class.

30:00.940 --> 30:06.920
We have a goal to be best in class by 2023 because as they write, we think the market

30:06.920 --> 30:10.120
will triple by then and they want to be positioned.

30:10.120 --> 30:12.400
Okay, you've got three years.

30:12.400 --> 30:13.400
How do you get there?

30:13.400 --> 30:17.840
Well, the old school way would be to solicit user feedback.

30:17.840 --> 30:22.680
But as many projects have shown time and time again, a lot of times you end up with the

30:22.680 --> 30:30.000
vocal minority really calling the shots then and you're not really seeing how your average

30:30.000 --> 30:32.920
user is utilizing a platform.

30:32.920 --> 30:37.040
So yeah, they're going to need this telemetry to really hit that goal.

30:37.040 --> 30:44.120
Yeah, they need to do it at scale too because I couldn't even guess at how many people individually

30:44.120 --> 30:49.360
use GitLab but their number for organizations which could have hundreds of thousands of

30:49.360 --> 30:54.320
users in some cases, 100,000 organizations use GitLab today.

30:54.320 --> 31:00.200
It's companies like Delta Air, Goldman Sachs, Ticketmaster, Nvidia and obviously a heck

31:00.200 --> 31:01.900
of a lot more.

31:01.900 --> 31:06.240
You need to understand where they're having problems because a lot of times when they

31:06.240 --> 31:09.320
hit an issue, they just bail.

31:09.320 --> 31:10.920
They just move on.

31:10.920 --> 31:14.560
They just do something else, have somebody else fix it.

31:14.560 --> 31:16.560
They don't go on a forum and complain.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.580
They don't start a Reddit post.

31:18.580 --> 31:21.160
They don't fill out a bug report.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.080
They move on with their day.

31:23.080 --> 31:27.960
And without data, you can't capture those events at scale.

31:27.960 --> 31:32.840
And I'm not sitting here advocating for tracking especially using closed source tracking software.

31:32.840 --> 31:34.600
That's not the way to do it.

31:34.600 --> 31:40.600
But at the same time, I can completely empathize with their position and with the fact that

31:40.600 --> 31:46.440
they have real serious questions being asked by their financers and they got to answer

31:46.440 --> 31:47.440
those.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.240
They just have to be able to strike that balance.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.480
Good luck to you GitLab.

31:50.480 --> 31:54.560
I really hope you find a good solution that's really going to make some other people happy.

31:54.560 --> 31:59.200
I don't know if it's going to involve bringing some people in-house and developing your own

31:59.200 --> 32:05.320
telemetry systems or working with Pendo to maybe open source some of their current JavaScript

32:05.320 --> 32:11.760
to make it a little more palatable but yeah, you're going to need it and I wish you the

32:11.760 --> 32:12.760
best of luck.

32:12.760 --> 32:13.760
Yeah.

32:13.760 --> 32:18.500
I like you think it's a really important project and want to see it continue and I like both

32:18.500 --> 32:23.920
those suggestions either do it in-house or work with one of those offensive proprietary

32:23.920 --> 32:26.720
solutions and make it less offensive.

32:26.720 --> 32:28.320
Maybe even open source it.

32:28.320 --> 32:33.800
I bet if there's a company out there that could have some sway, it's GitLab.

32:33.800 --> 32:40.720
Google also has seen some much improved stats around Project Treble and how it is improving

32:40.720 --> 32:44.280
user adoption of Android OS updates.

32:44.280 --> 32:51.160
So as a reminder, Treble started with Oreo 8 and it is a way to kind of modularize Android

32:51.160 --> 32:57.560
so that you've got this generic system image underneath and then vendors can build their

32:57.560 --> 33:04.560
sort of skins on top of it rather than having to modify the entire system image just to

33:04.560 --> 33:10.220
get your branding and all of the apps that you want to preload on there, which would

33:10.220 --> 33:14.880
then make it much more difficult to upgrade in the future because then you have to rewrite

33:14.880 --> 33:18.080
all the code for the new version.

33:18.080 --> 33:24.920
Treble circumvents that by making it more modular system and it wasn't until Android

33:24.920 --> 33:30.040
9 and now 10 launched that they were really able to get some metrics on it and those metrics

33:30.040 --> 33:32.320
have been pretty stellar.

33:32.320 --> 33:33.320
Right.

33:33.320 --> 33:37.440
You get it in one release but then you don't really even start to see the fruits of that

33:37.440 --> 33:42.860
labor until the following release but then because of the delay cycle in the OEMs, it's

33:42.860 --> 33:49.120
actually the release after the following release where you really start to see it take traction

33:49.120 --> 33:52.160
and anecdotally, some of us have noticed it.

33:52.160 --> 33:55.600
The Essential phone was announced with Android 10 right away.

33:55.600 --> 33:59.960
Yaomei also announced a phone on the same day that Google did running Android 10.

33:59.960 --> 34:04.000
OnePlus started its beta program on the same day as well and also it's worth mentioning

34:04.000 --> 34:09.960
the OnePlus 7T has launched with Android 10 already loaded on board.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.680
This is all thanks to Treble.

34:11.680 --> 34:18.320
Ya, and not only that, other larger manufacturers who are usually really slow to update have

34:18.320 --> 34:23.160
really stepped up their game and are saying that they're aiming to release Android 10

34:23.160 --> 34:26.280
on several of their devices by the end of the year.

34:26.280 --> 34:28.480
There's a bit of system magic that's happening here.

34:28.480 --> 34:32.420
We can talk about the way they've broken things off into different modules but really by having

34:32.420 --> 34:38.280
this base system that is signed by Google that is being updated independently, it has

34:38.280 --> 34:43.720
enabled not just the OEMs that we like to talk about all the time but even the ROM community

34:43.720 --> 34:44.720
as well.

34:44.720 --> 34:49.600
The ROM community can use these generic system images to function kind of the same way that

34:49.600 --> 34:56.880
the OEMs are in that they can use that base system image to layer on top of it with the

34:56.880 --> 35:02.800
goods that they want and ship them out to any phone that was launched with Oreo or Pi

35:02.800 --> 35:04.920
so long as it has an unlocked bootloader.

35:04.920 --> 35:10.000
Like so many things in Android there always are a few caveats but it is nice to just have

35:10.000 --> 35:15.640
a story like this where the situation is improving and there's data to show it's improving.

35:15.640 --> 35:20.720
So often with Android the story has always been, well you'll never get that update.

35:20.720 --> 35:22.680
That's finally starting to shift.

35:22.680 --> 35:28.040
It's going to take a few more phone cycles to really be in that perhaps possible utopia

35:28.040 --> 35:31.360
but we're clearly seeing data that shows we're on that way.

35:31.360 --> 35:33.400
We're on the path, Drew, you know?

35:33.400 --> 35:34.400
Like it's finally happening.

35:34.400 --> 35:40.840
Oh yeah and I'm pretty excited for it and you know Google hasn't just been putting all

35:40.840 --> 35:42.500
their eggs in the trouble basket.

35:42.500 --> 35:48.200
They've also been collaborating with silicon manufacturers to help them enable the jump

35:48.200 --> 35:49.520
to Android 10 as well.

35:49.520 --> 35:55.000
Ah yes us iOS users will have one less thing to feel superior about soon but I think it's

35:55.000 --> 35:58.040
worth it and I'm happy for it really.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.440
I'd love to see these updates roll out more frequently.

36:00.440 --> 36:05.040
Not so happy about how things are looking though for Disney Plus on Linux.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.160
They're much talked about streaming service.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.240
Well it's not just Linux though.

36:09.240 --> 36:17.000
It's any device that doesn't support the strictest version of Widevine DRM enforcement.

36:17.000 --> 36:22.240
Widevine has three possible security levels and Disney Plus is using the absolute most

36:22.240 --> 36:27.600
strict level meaning that anything functioning at those two lower levels can't connect to

36:27.600 --> 36:28.600
it.

36:28.600 --> 36:34.360
My understanding is that Netflix and other platforms use the same technology but they

36:34.360 --> 36:35.360
just dial it down.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.120
They don't have it at maximum abuse mode.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.800
Well they do and they don't.

36:39.800 --> 36:47.760
They support the maximum mode but if your browser or device is not capable of utilizing

36:47.760 --> 36:50.840
that maximum mode they will drop down.

36:50.840 --> 36:57.160
So instead of getting a full HD or 4k resolution you'll get something a little lower but it'll

36:57.160 --> 36:58.160
still play.

36:58.160 --> 36:59.160
I see.

36:59.160 --> 37:05.600
And now Linux and Android only support the very lowest level which is only software encryption

37:05.600 --> 37:11.360
which means that while you can watch videos in Linux or on Android with a little bit of

37:11.360 --> 37:17.680
a neutered resolution it's still going to work but with Disney Plus not allowing that

37:17.680 --> 37:22.620
fallback there's just no possibility to use it at all.

37:22.620 --> 37:26.300
It's funny because you can almost make money on a bet that says when a company doubles

37:26.300 --> 37:33.880
down on DRM there will be so many online versions of that content to then meet the demand.

37:33.880 --> 37:34.880
You know what I mean?

37:34.880 --> 37:37.680
They're almost guaranteeing piracy of their content doing this.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.440
How can they not understand that?

37:39.440 --> 37:45.920
And with a company as big and as influential as Disney is you really think they would but

37:45.920 --> 37:52.120
users are still getting this error 83 and when contacting customer service they sometimes

37:52.120 --> 37:56.700
don't even know what this error 83 is.

37:56.700 --> 38:02.480
So part of me wonders how prevalent it is and how many people with these unsupported

38:02.480 --> 38:08.200
devices have signed up for Disney Plus but at the same time part of me knows that they're

38:08.200 --> 38:13.780
aware of it and either it's really low on their radar or they're not sure how to fix

38:13.780 --> 38:17.760
it because it's been over a month since these reports started rolling out.

38:17.760 --> 38:18.760
Well who's to say?

38:18.760 --> 38:23.960
I recognize that people that want to watch streaming content on their PC are not the

38:23.960 --> 38:27.880
majority regardless of platform Mac or Windows or Linux.

38:27.880 --> 38:33.120
Most people are on a set top box or they're on mobile or maybe a tablet and I appreciate

38:33.120 --> 38:38.720
that fact but there is like this category of us who have multiple screens.

38:38.720 --> 38:44.240
We work all day at our desk and sometimes it's a very monotonous kind of work you know

38:44.240 --> 38:47.600
a Netflix binge or something like that of a show that's not like crazy important but

38:47.600 --> 38:49.200
you kind of want to watch.

38:49.200 --> 38:53.120
It's perfect for that and I could easily see catching up on Disney content because it's

38:53.120 --> 38:59.000
not just Disney cartoons it's everything that monster owns and that would be nice to have

38:59.000 --> 39:04.160
on the desktop and that will create a demand which will lead to piracy and the way around

39:04.160 --> 39:09.140
that is to make it easily accessible legally to paying customers and when you fail to do

39:09.140 --> 39:15.420
that there's a lesson the internet teaches companies over and over and over again.

39:15.420 --> 39:20.040
Like somebody should create a podcast that just tracks how many times this happens and

39:20.040 --> 39:24.440
how companies have to learn this lesson over and over again and now Disney's going to learn

39:24.440 --> 39:26.080
it.

39:26.080 --> 39:30.600
People's media servers their Kodi boxes will be stuffed full of Disney Plus content and

39:30.600 --> 39:35.640
it won't be via a streaming add-on that they've keenly developed for Kodi.

39:35.640 --> 39:36.640
Let's just put it that way.

39:36.640 --> 39:40.800
Well and you mentioned set top boxes there I think that's going to be the predominant

39:40.800 --> 39:47.300
way for people to really stream the service just like with many of the other services.

39:47.300 --> 39:52.520
So that's the target use case and to their credit Disney Plus does have apps available

39:52.520 --> 39:58.780
for both the Android ecosystem and the Apple ecosystem to be able to stream their content.

39:58.780 --> 40:04.120
So if you have something like an NVIDIA shield that is Android based you're not left out

40:04.120 --> 40:11.560
in the cold but there is something to be said for smart TVs that have Linux baked in to

40:11.560 --> 40:16.920
be able to run content without an external set top box.

40:16.920 --> 40:23.200
Disney needs to cater to that market as well and the way to do that is through Linux.

40:23.200 --> 40:27.040
There are more and more TVs that are running things like web OS that aren't Android based

40:27.040 --> 40:30.580
that perhaps Disney will want to stream to so maybe they will need to reconsider their

40:30.580 --> 40:33.880
support of the Linux platform sooner than later.

40:33.880 --> 40:40.120
There was some sort of indication that they are working on the problem but it's really

40:40.120 --> 40:41.720
early days for the service.

40:41.720 --> 40:46.320
They're not transparent on the process and there's been no updates or any progress in

40:46.320 --> 40:49.920
the last month so I'm betting it's a back burner kind of thing.

40:49.920 --> 40:54.320
So it's something to be aware of if you're thinking about subscribing to the Disney Plus

40:54.320 --> 40:59.920
streaming service that you may not be able to watch it on your Linux box for a long time.

40:59.920 --> 41:01.120
Maybe that's not an issue for you.

41:01.120 --> 41:05.920
You've got a set top box no big deal or maybe it is and we wanted you to be aware of it.

41:05.920 --> 41:08.320
That's just sort of the bottom line right now.

41:08.320 --> 41:11.840
Well if anything changes with this story or any of the other stories that we've covered
