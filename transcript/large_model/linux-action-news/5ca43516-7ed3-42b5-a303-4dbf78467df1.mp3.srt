00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 129, recorded on October 27, 2019.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,200
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,200
And I'm Drew.

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,280
Well, hello, Drew.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,920
That wasn't the plan, was it?

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,920
No.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,920
Turns out Joe has a little illness going on and he won't be joining today.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:26,040
Some con cred, as it always happens when you travel to events in the winter.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,080
So we wish him a quick recovery, and in the meantime, we kick things off with really great

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,700
news out of the GNOME Foundation.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,800
They're taking the fight to the patent troll.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,300
They've filed defense against the patent troll going after Shotwell.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,600
That's absolutely right.

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,000
And just as a reminder to everybody, they are being sued for patent infringement by

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,320
Rothschild Patent Imaging LLC.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,080
Yeah, they need the money.

17
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Everybody knows that.

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,080
Right.

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,080
Of course.

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:59,440
But Rothschild did offer them a settlement offer for somewhere high in the five figures,

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,880
but GNOME actually turned it down.

22
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,260
This is the part that really kind of gets me fired up.

23
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,600
And I'm really grateful for the GNOME Foundation here.

24
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,320
They write on their blog, quote, this would have been simple to do so, i.e. accept that

25
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,560
compromise.

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,600
But they go on to say, it would have caused less work, it would have cost us less money,

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,920
and it would have provided the foundation a lot less stress.

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,560
But it also would be wrong.

29
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,880
Agreeing to this would leave the patent live and allow it to be used as a weapon against

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,520
countless others.

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,400
They conclude by saying, we will stand firm against this baseless attack, not just for

32
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,840
GNOME and Shotwell, but for all free and open source software projects.

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,840
Yes.

34
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,980
And I think this is really the right move and is a good example to set for the free

35
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,840
software community in general.

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,840
Now granted, not everybody has the kind of pull and weight that the GNOME Foundation

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,360
has to be able to fight this sort of thing.

38
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,360
But since they do, they're doing the right thing here.

39
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,520
Well, I think that's why it's important that they are the ones to take this fight on.

40
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,160
I don't know how much weight and pull they do have.

41
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,520
And I think that's why it's important that when we talk about these things, we mentioned

42
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,600
they have set up a legal fund, not just for this, but future fights as well.

43
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,960
The software conservancy is getting behind them like there is things lining up, but it's

44
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,240
not a sure thing yet.

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,840
And we really want to see this thing succeed because if the GNOME Foundation, heaven forbid,

46
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,500
were to fail, this Rothschild patent imaging sham LLC would be emboldened to move forward.

47
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,260
They started with barbecue restaurants and small little chains in Florida, and now they're

48
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:45,600
moving on to the internet and going after anything that uses this vaguely defined image

49
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,080
transfer metadata patent.

50
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,880
It's weak on the very grounds.

51
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,520
So there's a good shot here that the GNOME Foundation can win this fight, but they have

52
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,220
to have the finances, they have to have the backing to do it.

53
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,800
And so that's why I feel like anytime we talk about this, we're going to put a link in the

54
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,060
show notes for the Patent Troll Defense Fund because it's not just for GNOME, it's not

55
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,500
just for Shotwell, it's for future open source projects because it will not stop here if

56
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,000
this patent troll wins.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,180
And the way that the GNOME Foundation is fighting this is Neil McGovern has instructed their

58
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,000
legal counsel at Sherman and Sterling to file the following papers, a motion to dismiss the

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,760
patent outright as invalid, an answer to the claim, which they don't even think that they

60
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,760
should have to file but are filing anyways, stating that Shotwell and Free Software in

61
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,880
general is not even affected by this patent, as well as a counterclaim just in case Rothschild

62
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,280
tries to drop the suit once they see that the GNOME Foundation is going to fight it.

63
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,680
I love this because what they've done here is they've recognized that these people didn't

64
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,120
do their homework properly and they don't even have a valid case here.

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,960
So this third, this counterclaim, this third paper they've filed to make sure they can't

66
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,480
just tuck and roll and try to get out of this and then go after somebody who doesn't do

67
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,440
their homework is the masterstroke of this procedure.

68
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,440
It really shows you that they've been thinking about this.

69
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,380
And also, it sends a signal.

70
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:14,200
It sends a signal to this horrible, twisted patent troll marketplace that you just can't

71
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,160
go after free software like this, that these foundations will seek legal counsel and they'll

72
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,760
go after you for it.

73
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,440
They'll hold you to the fire.

74
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,600
Yes, and the GNOME Foundation even goes so far as to say, we want to send a message to

75
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,560
all software patent trolls out there.

76
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,840
We will fight your suit.

77
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,120
We will win.

78
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,640
And we will have your patent invalidated.

79
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,480
Well, I'm happy to say they are making good progress to their goal of 125,000.

80
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,520
I suspect they're going to need a lot more than that.

81
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:48,040
But so far, as we record this episode of Linux Action News, they have raised 80,000 US greenbacks

82
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,400
and they're close to tipping to 81,000.

83
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,960
So we'll put a link in the show notes again.

84
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,040
I think this is something that matters a lot.

85
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,160
And maybe we can get them to that goal of 125.

86
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,160
I'm looking at this.

87
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,480
I'm thinking there's no, you can't, you can't do this for $125,000.

88
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,720
But this is a good start.

89
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,160
So let's get them to at least that goal.

90
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,380
Yes, absolutely.

91
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,760
And also throwing a little bit of weight behind them.

92
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,420
You've also got the Software Freedom Conservancy, Debian and the Document Foundation, all pledging

93
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,120
to stand with the GNOME Foundation, which I think is great as a show of support.

94
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,080
Well, I think Will Cook has our support.

95
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,160
He was the director of engineering for the Ubuntu desktop, but he has left Canonical.

96
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
That's right.

97
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,560
He's moving over to InfluxDB, which is an open source time series database solution.

98
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,520
And Martin Wimperis is going to be taking over his spot.

99
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,720
Yeah, that's great for Will and it's also really great for Wimpy.

100
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,760
I can't think of anyone better to take on this new role.

101
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,600
And I think it'd be nice to kind of look back over some of the things that Will accomplished

102
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,760
because the last five years of the Ubuntu desktop have been some of the most significant

103
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,480
change we've witnessed.

104
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
Absolutely.

105
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:02,120
They have really come out of the gate strong with all of those releases.

106
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,760
And that was after some would say a little bit of a slump in quality.

107
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:13,480
I think Will really brought Ubuntu up to where it needed to be.

108
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:19,320
And the last few releases especially have just been of exceptional quality, if you ask

109
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
me.

110
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,020
There was a couple of pivotal moments for Will under his leadership of the Ubuntu desktop

111
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,540
that I recognized.

112
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,280
Number one was he opened up a dialogue with the wider community.

113
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,720
He kind of stepped outside the Linux bubble and said, what do you want in a Linux desktop?

114
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,360
And a lot of them came back with, we want the GNOME shell.

115
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,000
We want sane defaults.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,440
We want this, that and the other thing.

117
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,760
And then he took that data and he went to Mark Shuttleworth and the whole team had a

118
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,800
conversation and we saw the announcement that they'd be transitioning from Unity to GNOME

119
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,440
shell, that they'd be essentially implementing all of these highly requested things that

120
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,120
the community wanted.

121
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,080
And he was there during that transition, but not only that, he was there during the investment

122
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,520
into GNOME shell to make it so smooth, so much more stable, so much more professional

123
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,200
grade than it was at the time they adopted it.

124
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,220
All of the changes that they have made in the past few months even have been pushing

125
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,640
GNOME way farther than I thought possible.

126
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,120
It has become such a great experience and such a joy to use that I think it's actually

127
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,600
starting to win a lot of people back.

128
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,620
I think I like the way this is being done.

129
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,300
The 1910 release got out.

130
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,040
It was a solid feature packed release.

131
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,720
And now Will's doing a nice transition and a handoff here.

132
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,940
He sought through some of the most challenging times of the distribution and got it to this

133
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:49,040
point where it's better than it's been, I mean, probably ever.

134
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,000
It's legitimately probably the best desktop they've ever shipped.

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,980
And we've been able to say that now for, like you mentioned, a few releases.

136
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,060
It's just been progressively getting better and better.

137
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,240
At the same time, that doesn't mean that we don't need to change things up a bit.

138
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,240
If you look at where they're going, they're going in a direction that's more professional

139
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,240
grade.

140
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,240
It's a development workstation.

141
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,540
They're working more with OEMs like Dell and they're taking their input and they're really

142
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,360
focusing the product.

143
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:23,240
At the same time, Microsoft is a big part of the story now, not only just with Azure,

144
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,480
but also with the Windows subsystem for Linux.

145
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,200
And that is something that Canonical is starting to take more seriously.

146
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,720
We may see that develop into its own official branch of the Ubuntu project.

147
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,100
And I think it's interesting as Wimpy takes on this desktop lead role, he's not just taking

148
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,600
that on, but he's also taking on the management for the Windows subsystem for the Linux.

149
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,760
Canonical is internalizing that.

150
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,580
And I think it shows not just a recognition that that's a legitimate platform, but it's

151
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:59,640
truly a recognition of how important the developer is for the Ubuntu platform and specifically

152
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,600
the Ubuntu desktop.

153
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,400
And that's why I think this is the perfect timing.

154
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,320
It will really turn this thing around and now Wimpy can take it and bring it to that

155
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,840
next phase.

156
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:16,520
And he may be one of the most uniquely positioned people, not just at Canonical, but in the

157
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,720
open source community to pull it off.

158
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,400
I completely agree.

159
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:28,320
He is definitely a person who has the leadership skills and the engineering background to really

160
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,320
do this.

161
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:36,080
Between his work with the MATE desktop and being so focused on SnapCraft and packaging

162
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,920
formats, he really knows what it takes to get something off the ground like this.

163
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:49,440
And he's also excellent at taking user feedback and implementing it into his work.

164
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,800
I really can't think of anybody else who would be better suited to this position right now.

165
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
Yeah.

166
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,720
So just a big congratulations to both Will and Wimpy from the team here at Jupiter Broadcasting.

167
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,840
And I think it's just going to make for a better product for end users.

168
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:10,400
So really just pretty happy all around about this and look forward to 2004.

169
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,140
It better be good now.

170
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,760
If he doesn't knock this out of the park, he's got five years to live it down.

171
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
It's true though.

172
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
Oh man.

173
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,240
At the same time, I'm super excited for him.

174
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,400
But then when I think about that, I'm like, oh, that's a tough spot to be in.

175
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,960
Well Firefox has some new features.

176
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,080
Keep an eye out for version 70 because when it lands, some new features come front and

177
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,040
center to tell you just what a good job it's doing.

178
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,320
I've actually already got this on my desktop.

179
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,240
It landed for me today in the Fedora repos.

180
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,600
And honestly, the new panel is really slick.

181
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,400
It is so good looking.

182
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,600
Yeah, I mean, really, this is one of the things I think that makes PyHole such a great project

183
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,920
is you get these great, nice looking visualizations of all of the hard work it's doing for you

184
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,080
and it kind of makes it click.

185
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,400
It really is actually actively protecting you.

186
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Right.

187
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,940
So not only is it showing you the metrics of how many trackers it's blocking, but it

188
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:16,280
also integrates with lockwise as well as Firefox monitor to show you not just your password

189
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,580
statistics, but also if you've set up monitor with your email address, it will even show

190
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:27,700
you how many breaches your email address has been involved in directly in that same panel.

191
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,520
And my understanding is it will flag future breaches as well.

192
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,660
So they have an analogy here that kind of actually works, but you'll have to just sort

193
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,820
of be a little forgiving.

194
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,840
They say, in some ways, a browser is like a car where the engine drives you to the places

195
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,800
you want to go and a dashboard tells you the basics, like how fast you're going or whether

196
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,520
you need gas.

197
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,740
But just like the car dashboard these days, it's telling you more and more.

198
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,400
And so they sort of see the browser is playing this role.

199
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,360
They want to bring three key things to the surface.

200
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,200
They want you to see how many times enhanced tracking protection has blocked an attempt

201
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,100
to tag you with a cookie.

202
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,760
They also want you to be aware of any potential future data breaches like we were just talking

203
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,760
about.

204
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,720
That's the Firefox monitor that works in conjunction with the have I been pwned database.

205
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,760
And then lastly, they really want you to consider using lockwise, manage your passwords and

206
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,660
sync them across your devices.

207
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,080
You get a brief idea of how many passwords you have, you get an overview of if they're

208
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,160
like complicated enough.

209
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,940
And in theory, you can work in conjunction with Firefox monitor to flag you and tell

210
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,240
you, hey, hey, you're using passwords that are on the public internet.

211
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,540
You better change those.

212
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,440
It also has some nice features for generating passwords.

213
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:50,720
So when you will go to sign up for a website or go to refresh a password, it will actually

214
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,520
prompt you to ask you, hey, do you want to go ahead and create a randomized password

215
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,340
for this and have me store it for you, which I think is a really killer feature and helps

216
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,440
people to remember that it's there and that they should be using it.

217
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
Well, yeah.

218
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,960
I mean, anybody listening to this goes, well, you know, bit warden or last pass or insert

219
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,760
name of password manager that does that for me already.

220
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,000
Well, good job.

221
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You.

222
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, you've done a good job.

223
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You've got a password manager.

224
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,680
Turns out, though, the rest of the world hasn't really caught up yet, unfortunately.

225
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,800
And so this is sort of bringing it to the masses.

226
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,800
I like that about it.

227
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:31,300
But I think really, if you were to take one thing away from version 70 is the data visualization.

228
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:37,040
It really just shows you in a very kind of understandable, readable way how fricking

229
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,080
bad the web is, you know, like, holy crap, like, and I've been running this, too.

230
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,000
I also got the same update you did just just for my morning prep for the show.

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,080
And I'm I'm in the hundreds already.

232
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,200
Oh, absolutely.

233
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,600
The news sites are almost the worst in some cases.

234
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Yeah.

235
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,760
I mean, they want to connect to Facebook, which thankfully, Firefox is already blocking

236
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,920
due to its Facebook container ization, which I love also, you know, they want to pull your

237
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,460
Google Analytics, they want to pull your Twitter traffic, they want to they want to pull everything

238
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,960
about you that they can.

239
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:18,160
And not only can that slow the pages down, it's also, you know, a little privacy invading.

240
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:25,640
Kind of tangentially related to this, there was some further details on Firefox's DNS

241
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,120
over HTTPS implementation.

242
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,240
And I think in an attempt to sort of alleviate some concerns around Cloudflare primarily.

243
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,840
Yes, for one, they are coming right out and saying, we are not entering into any kind

244
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,480
of financial agreement with Cloudflare.

245
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,280
None of this has anything to do with any money.

246
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,400
Beyond that, Cloudflare has also signed a contract that states that they are meeting

247
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,360
the privacy requirements that Firefox has set forth.

248
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:59,040
And they've agreed that neither party is allowed to make money by monetizing the data pulled

249
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,120
from any DNS requests.

250
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,240
So overall, I think that they are doing a pretty good job to alleviate the concerns.

251
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:14,860
Now I think a lot of people are still going to be really wary of Cloudflare in specific.

252
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,440
But Mozilla has also stated that they're working with more resolvers to try and get them to

253
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,280
sign that same contract that Cloudflare signed and get them into their trusted recursive

254
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,600
resolver program.

255
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,760
I think that would be a very good move on their part that would do substantially more

256
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,340
to alleviate people's concerns than just sort of reiterating what we kind of already knew

257
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,320
about their Cloudflare agreement.

258
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:41,480
Granted, some of this is new details, but a lot of this was sort of implied through

259
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,320
Mozilla's blogs already.

260
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:51,520
And I think what we see happening to Cloudflare is both good and also unfortunate.

261
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:59,040
I think the community is taking all of the bad lessons learned about Google and all of

262
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,760
the great things Google said about doing no evil and all of that, and they're taking all

263
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,720
of it, internalizing that and just preemptively applying it to Cloudflare before they even

264
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,800
get to the position to abuse power.

265
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,400
People are sick of it.

266
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:19,040
At the same time, I think it's a good thing because lesson learned, good on us.

267
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,080
We won't be fooled twice.

268
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:26,560
But it's unfortunate because Cloudflare is not Google, and they have not done the same

269
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,400
things that Google has done.

270
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,740
And we should judge each in their own based on their own actions.

271
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:37,520
And if we were to go by the actions here, it would seem that Cloudflare is really playing

272
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,440
ball with Mozilla from the complying with their privacy standards to no financial transactions

273
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,240
involved with this.

274
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,960
There's no monetizing of data that's in the agreement.

275
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,220
All of that really should be satisfying most of us.

276
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:55,480
That's a pretty unprecedented level of agreement that you don't typically see with these kinds

277
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,320
of companies, and Mozilla should be recognized for achieving that.

278
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,920
But it hasn't really satiated that overall concern that I think has been baked into us

279
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,120
from companies like Google and probably Facebook.

280
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,800
Yeah, I think you're right.

281
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:17,480
But let's move on to a little bit of the technical details about how they're utilizing DOH.

282
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:25,720
For one, if DOH fails, it will drop back to standard basic DNS to fulfill a query.

283
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:32,180
So it's not like DOH is just going to start breaking things left and right.

284
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:38,400
And beyond that, they're also providing a method for sites to state, hey, we don't work

285
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
with DOH.

286
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,320
DOH breaks our functionality.

287
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,160
Can you please fall back to DNS before even trying DOH?

288
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,860
So sites can actually break out of that and say, no, no, no, we don't want DOH.

289
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,400
Please give us standard DNS, and Firefox will attempt to accommodate that.

290
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,840
And some other use cases involving that same strategy are things like parental controls.

291
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:09,400
So if you're using something like Umbrella or some other kind of parental DNS overlay,

292
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,520
Firefox should automatically detect it by using a canary domain and then fall back to

293
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:21,760
standard DNS because clearly you have made a decision to use something to implement parental

294
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,160
controls.

295
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,120
Same thing with enterprise policies.

296
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,440
If it detects enterprise policies, again, it will automatically disable DOH and fall

297
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,500
back to standard DNS so as not to break your enterprise local DNS settings, which I think

298
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,080
all of those are the right move, especially coming out the gate.

299
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,400
Yeah, those don't sound bad.

300
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:50,000
I think in particular, all of those will come down to let's see it in action because auto-detecting

301
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,880
based on a canary list is useful, but it's sort of like antivirus that's only based on

302
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,440
pattern detection.

303
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,920
You only will be able to detect the known things, and if somebody stands up a new project

304
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:08,880
or somebody creates their own system for their LAN, it may or may not detect those things.

305
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,560
We'll just have to wait and see.

306
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,620
It perhaps will accommodate, but we don't know.

307
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:22,040
I have been using DOH in my day-to-day usage for months, maybe month and a half, two months,

308
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,800
essentially since we started talking about it regularly here on the show, and it's been

309
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,680
unnotable.

310
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,720
It wasn't until I recently had an issue where my PyHole box was blocking some domains, at

311
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,280
least I suspect that was happening, and I couldn't resolve them, and I didn't know why,

312
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,400
and so I turned on DOH and it started working.

313
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:50,320
Now that would seem to indicate to me that Firefox's DOH implementation failed to auto-detect

314
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,000
that I was using PyHole intentionally and still let me resolve those sites, which yay

315
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,080
for me, I wanted to get to those sites, but doesn't seem to speak well for the overall

316
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,600
implementation.

317
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,320
Perhaps it is yet to be fully implemented.

318
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,560
Well and they do have a kill switch too.

319
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:13,440
So if you're an administrator and you're rolling out say like Firefox to an enterprise, you

320
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,760
can go ahead and preemptively disable it in about config, and if you're a general user,

321
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,840
you can manually disable it in the browser under the preferences by going to the network

322
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,360
settings under general, and there's a really easy checkbox, enable or disable DOH right

323
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,560
there, and it will let you pick your provider, granted there's only one right now, but the

324
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,760
functionality is already there to change.

325
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,400
Yeah, there's only one now, and that's how I turned it on.

326
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:49,840
I opted in so that way I could have some experience when I talk about this on air, because I do

327
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,360
manage DNS.

328
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,440
I use DNS very intentionally on my LAN and I want that to work when I want to connect

329
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,160
to a local box, I just want to use its friendly name.

330
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:05,860
So I've been trying it out and I like to try to hold the two things separately.

331
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:11,680
There's the technology implementation and then there's the policies and politics around

332
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,960
the implementation, the avoiding surveillance, all of the other things like perhaps cloud

333
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
flares issues.

334
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,920
There are two separate issues, the tech and the politics, and as far as I'm concerned,

335
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:28,240
the tech is useful, and so as long as I can continue to run my own DOH servers and I can

336
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,480
choose my own provider or add my own custom entry or turn it on or turn it off, I say

337
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,440
it's a great thing to have in the browser, because there are situations where your local

338
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:46,840
DNS sucks, and having reliable, fast, secure, signed DNS is a good thing, and you could

339
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,080
just go turn it on with a single freaking checkbox and you can turn it off with another

340
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,480
click of that same freaking checkbox, and I think that makes it a good thing in my book.

341
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,960
Well one thing that you can opt out of, at least for now, is GitLab Telemetry.

342
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:07,360
They announced recently that they were going to start adding JavaScript-based code that

343
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,200
would run in a user's browser to pull telemetry data and submit it back up to GitLab via a

344
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,920
third-party platform called Pendo, but they're backtracking a bit on this.

345
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:26,100
This is a fascinating story, and when you read their original post, at least what remains

346
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:33,000
of it, you can tell they're really kind of approaching this from a very trepidatious

347
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,600
standpoint.

348
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,080
This is an ugly truth of software as a service.

349
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,540
You need data.

350
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,540
You need metrics.

351
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:45,160
You need to know what parts of your platform you're losing people, what parts of your platform

352
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:51,560
are the best, and where you can improve or fix things in between, and without metrics

353
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:56,440
of what your users are clicking on, how long they're spending in areas, where they bail,

354
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,440
where the transaction fails, without those metrics, you don't know where to improve.

355
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,000
You build something, you get thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of users in some cases,

356
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,840
and then you're blind as to what they're doing on the platform.

357
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,600
Imagine that scenario.

358
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,640
That sounds frightening.

359
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,320
You'd just be guessing, going by instinct, well I feel like we ought to improve this.

360
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,960
This is essentially the situation GitLab found themselves in, and so they thought, well,

361
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
let's think about this.

362
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,240
Let's be real reasonable here.

363
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,720
I know what we'll do.

364
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,840
We'll get more data on how users are using GitLab, and they had a nice plan.

365
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,640
They do something real minor, just a little JavaScript snippet like Drew said, something

366
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,640
real simple.

367
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,400
They'd be real transparent about it in their privacy statement, and they may also put it

368
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,320
out in different versions of GitLab, just so they get that data as well, but don't worry.

369
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,760
If you turn on Do Not Track, we'll respect it, and it's all going to be fine.

370
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:58,400
Well, like so many things like this, the internet didn't respond so well, and there may have

371
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,680
been some parts of this official post that got removed later on too, which is a little

372
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
suspicious.

373
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:10,000
Including impressive financial results for our shareholders was the piece that got removed.

374
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,840
Now I want to give you the context here because it's important.

375
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:20,480
The original line read, on one hand, we value results, including impressive financial results

376
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,600
for our shareholders, and we believe an open core model is the best path to achieve that.

377
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,040
It also means making our products better as fast as possible for our customers and users.

378
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,920
Now what's important there is that they're pulling out that information about wanting

379
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:45,280
to provide financial results, which essentially reads as, we're going to monetize this data

380
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,260
that we are pulling out of your browser.

381
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,260
Not a good look.

382
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,500
No, I think that's not what they intended.

383
00:24:53,500 --> 00:25:00,760
What they, I assume, were trying to convey was almost like this triumphant, we're going

384
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:07,320
to give impressive results to our shareholders because of our open core approach.

385
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,560
Our open core approach will bring them great dividends, and that's an important metric

386
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,840
for us because open source making money is important to us.

387
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,760
I think that was the intention of the statement, but man does it not read like that at all.

388
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,600
Oh yeah, I totally agree.

389
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:31,400
I think this is essentially them saying through improvements to the product, we're going to

390
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:39,800
have more users and show better return on our professional paid product, but whoever

391
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,960
wrote this copy made a whoopsie.

392
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,520
I think they were trying to be bold.

393
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,640
Also you could interpret that as impressive financial results equals sustainability, which

394
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,160
is important for a product like this in the developer ecosystem.

395
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:03,120
I kind of understand the somewhat backwards logic that led to that line being in there,

396
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,420
but imagine Drew as well.

397
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,860
This was proofread by a handful, at least maybe even a dozen people.

398
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:15,440
This wasn't just something a guy wrote up and then posted on the web.

399
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,380
This is something that they really as a group thought, yeah, this is the way to get this

400
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,200
message across that open core and open source can make money.

401
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,840
The whole situation just looks bad and then to back out of the data collection both doesn't

402
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,760
really solve the problem and also just punts it down the road and they'll have to get back

403
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,760
to this at some point.

404
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,200
They do need these metrics.

405
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,880
They really should just come up with a way to bake them in that isn't offensive to the

406
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,840
end users and I couldn't tell them how to do that, but when you read their post, I read

407
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,440
something that comes across as trepidatious, lots of couching, lots of telling you why

408
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,300
this is the best scenario that they've come to and how they're going to try to do it right

409
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:04,200
and how they're going to try to be transparent and then you give it a few days and they immediately

410
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,720
turn around and they say, okay, we're not going to do it.

411
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,120
I mean, we're going to do it, but we're not going to do it right now.

412
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,520
We're going to give it a rethink.

413
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,220
They even mentioned that a lot of the pushback was because some of the code that would be

414
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:23,320
running in users' browsers is closed source and the reason for that is a lot of these

415
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:29,840
third-party telemetry scripts, like the really good professional ones, are proprietary and

416
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,360
using software as a service rather than something that they would bake into their site in order

417
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,960
to save some money, save some engineering time, they'd probably have to hire somebody

418
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:43,060
to do that particular work.

419
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:48,560
It makes sense from a business perspective to go ahead and outsource that, but I mean,

420
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:53,160
especially when you're talking about a community that writes source code and shares source

421
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:59,760
code, they're not super into having closed source code run in their browser.

422
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,600
I also don't think GitLab needs to participate in these chickenshit closed source tracking

423
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:11,640
systems that are designed to create bogus stats for an industry that lives off of hype.

424
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,960
They don't need to play that game.

425
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:20,420
They can write their own checks and I suspect that this was the result of trying to achieve

426
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:25,800
a certain set of goals about trying to reach certain metrics in performance, in stability,

427
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:31,960
in bug fixing, and in financial performance and after the group got together and had a

428
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:38,480
nice good group think on it, this was their solution to solve that problem and now this

429
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,080
has put a big red flag up and now they're going to, as a group, have to rethink it and

430
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,720
I would bet you their second take on this is going to be much more palatable.

431
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,120
Well I hope so because I like the GitLab project.

432
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,620
I think it's a good project and I think it's got some legs, but I would be remiss if I

433
00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:01,280
didn't bring up, hey, this is like a month after they announced a $268 million Series

434
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,680
E round of funding.

435
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,280
It's got to be at least partially connected to that.

436
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,160
Yeah, that is a little bit coincidental.

437
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,480
On their blog they write, our plans for the funding are straightforward.

438
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,940
GitLab will invest to make all of our DevOps platform offerings, including monitoring security

439
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:23,080
and planning, best in class so we can enable our enterprise customers continue to bring

440
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,480
products to the market faster.

441
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,260
That's a great goal.

442
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,600
How do they know where their product is currently lacking?

443
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,480
How do you make it best in class without data telling you where the problems are?

444
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:39,640
Where as they might say in the biz, the friction is.

445
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:46,160
Without the ability to identify that friction and lower that friction, they can't make it

446
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,840
the best in class.

447
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:55,280
You can easily see how you go from, well we've just taken on $268 million in Series E funding,

448
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,900
all of these A, B, C, D and E funders want data.

449
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,940
We want to be best in class.

450
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:06,920
We have a goal to be best in class by 2023 because as they write, we think the market

451
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,120
will triple by then and they want to be positioned.

452
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,400
Okay, you've got three years.

453
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
How do you get there?

454
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,840
Well, the old school way would be to solicit user feedback.

455
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,680
But as many projects have shown time and time again, a lot of times you end up with the

456
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:30,000
vocal minority really calling the shots then and you're not really seeing how your average

457
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,920
user is utilizing a platform.

458
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,040
So yeah, they're going to need this telemetry to really hit that goal.

459
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:44,120
Yeah, they need to do it at scale too because I couldn't even guess at how many people individually

460
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,360
use GitLab but their number for organizations which could have hundreds of thousands of

461
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,320
users in some cases, 100,000 organizations use GitLab today.

462
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,200
It's companies like Delta Air, Goldman Sachs, Ticketmaster, Nvidia and obviously a heck

463
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,900
of a lot more.

464
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:06,240
You need to understand where they're having problems because a lot of times when they

465
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,320
hit an issue, they just bail.

466
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,920
They just move on.

467
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:14,560
They just do something else, have somebody else fix it.

468
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,560
They don't go on a forum and complain.

469
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,580
They don't start a Reddit post.

470
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,160
They don't fill out a bug report.

471
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,080
They move on with their day.

472
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,960
And without data, you can't capture those events at scale.

473
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,840
And I'm not sitting here advocating for tracking especially using closed source tracking software.

474
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,600
That's not the way to do it.

475
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:40,600
But at the same time, I can completely empathize with their position and with the fact that

476
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:46,440
they have real serious questions being asked by their financers and they got to answer

477
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,440
those.

478
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,240
They just have to be able to strike that balance.

479
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,480
Good luck to you GitLab.

480
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,560
I really hope you find a good solution that's really going to make some other people happy.

481
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:59,200
I don't know if it's going to involve bringing some people in-house and developing your own

482
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,320
telemetry systems or working with Pendo to maybe open source some of their current JavaScript

483
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,760
to make it a little more palatable but yeah, you're going to need it and I wish you the

484
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
best of luck.

485
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,760
Yeah.

486
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,500
I like you think it's a really important project and want to see it continue and I like both

487
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,920
those suggestions either do it in-house or work with one of those offensive proprietary

488
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,720
solutions and make it less offensive.

489
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,320
Maybe even open source it.

490
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,800
I bet if there's a company out there that could have some sway, it's GitLab.

491
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:40,720
Google also has seen some much improved stats around Project Treble and how it is improving

492
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,280
user adoption of Android OS updates.

493
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:51,160
So as a reminder, Treble started with Oreo 8 and it is a way to kind of modularize Android

494
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:57,560
so that you've got this generic system image underneath and then vendors can build their

495
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:04,560
sort of skins on top of it rather than having to modify the entire system image just to

496
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:10,220
get your branding and all of the apps that you want to preload on there, which would

497
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,880
then make it much more difficult to upgrade in the future because then you have to rewrite

498
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,080
all the code for the new version.

499
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,920
Treble circumvents that by making it more modular system and it wasn't until Android

500
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:30,040
9 and now 10 launched that they were really able to get some metrics on it and those metrics

501
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,320
have been pretty stellar.

502
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,320
Right.

503
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,440
You get it in one release but then you don't really even start to see the fruits of that

504
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,860
labor until the following release but then because of the delay cycle in the OEMs, it's

505
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:49,120
actually the release after the following release where you really start to see it take traction

506
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,160
and anecdotally, some of us have noticed it.

507
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,600
The Essential phone was announced with Android 10 right away.

508
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,960
Yaomei also announced a phone on the same day that Google did running Android 10.

509
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,000
OnePlus started its beta program on the same day as well and also it's worth mentioning

510
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,960
the OnePlus 7T has launched with Android 10 already loaded on board.

511
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,680
This is all thanks to Treble.

512
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:18,320
Ya, and not only that, other larger manufacturers who are usually really slow to update have

513
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,160
really stepped up their game and are saying that they're aiming to release Android 10

514
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,280
on several of their devices by the end of the year.

515
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,480
There's a bit of system magic that's happening here.

516
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,420
We can talk about the way they've broken things off into different modules but really by having

517
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:38,280
this base system that is signed by Google that is being updated independently, it has

518
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,720
enabled not just the OEMs that we like to talk about all the time but even the ROM community

519
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,720
as well.

520
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,600
The ROM community can use these generic system images to function kind of the same way that

521
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:56,880
the OEMs are in that they can use that base system image to layer on top of it with the

522
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:02,800
goods that they want and ship them out to any phone that was launched with Oreo or Pi

523
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,920
so long as it has an unlocked bootloader.

524
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:10,000
Like so many things in Android there always are a few caveats but it is nice to just have

525
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,640
a story like this where the situation is improving and there's data to show it's improving.

526
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,720
So often with Android the story has always been, well you'll never get that update.

527
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,680
That's finally starting to shift.

528
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,040
It's going to take a few more phone cycles to really be in that perhaps possible utopia

529
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,360
but we're clearly seeing data that shows we're on that way.

530
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,400
We're on the path, Drew, you know?

531
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Like it's finally happening.

532
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,840
Oh yeah and I'm pretty excited for it and you know Google hasn't just been putting all

533
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,500
their eggs in the trouble basket.

534
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:48,200
They've also been collaborating with silicon manufacturers to help them enable the jump

535
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,520
to Android 10 as well.

536
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,000
Ah yes us iOS users will have one less thing to feel superior about soon but I think it's

537
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,040
worth it and I'm happy for it really.

538
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,440
I'd love to see these updates roll out more frequently.

539
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,040
Not so happy about how things are looking though for Disney Plus on Linux.

540
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,160
They're much talked about streaming service.

541
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,240
Well it's not just Linux though.

542
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:17,000
It's any device that doesn't support the strictest version of Widevine DRM enforcement.

543
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,240
Widevine has three possible security levels and Disney Plus is using the absolute most

544
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,600
strict level meaning that anything functioning at those two lower levels can't connect to

545
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,600
it.

546
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:34,360
My understanding is that Netflix and other platforms use the same technology but they

547
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,360
just dial it down.

548
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,120
They don't have it at maximum abuse mode.

549
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,800
Well they do and they don't.

550
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:47,760
They support the maximum mode but if your browser or device is not capable of utilizing

551
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,840
that maximum mode they will drop down.

552
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:57,160
So instead of getting a full HD or 4k resolution you'll get something a little lower but it'll

553
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,160
still play.

554
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,160
I see.

555
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:05,600
And now Linux and Android only support the very lowest level which is only software encryption

556
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:11,360
which means that while you can watch videos in Linux or on Android with a little bit of

557
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:17,680
a neutered resolution it's still going to work but with Disney Plus not allowing that

558
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,620
fallback there's just no possibility to use it at all.

559
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,300
It's funny because you can almost make money on a bet that says when a company doubles

560
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:33,880
down on DRM there will be so many online versions of that content to then meet the demand.

561
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,880
You know what I mean?

562
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,680
They're almost guaranteeing piracy of their content doing this.

563
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,440
How can they not understand that?

564
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,920
And with a company as big and as influential as Disney is you really think they would but

565
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:52,120
users are still getting this error 83 and when contacting customer service they sometimes

566
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,700
don't even know what this error 83 is.

567
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:02,480
So part of me wonders how prevalent it is and how many people with these unsupported

568
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,200
devices have signed up for Disney Plus but at the same time part of me knows that they're

569
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:13,780
aware of it and either it's really low on their radar or they're not sure how to fix

570
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,760
it because it's been over a month since these reports started rolling out.

571
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
Well who's to say?

572
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,960
I recognize that people that want to watch streaming content on their PC are not the

573
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,880
majority regardless of platform Mac or Windows or Linux.

574
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:33,120
Most people are on a set top box or they're on mobile or maybe a tablet and I appreciate

575
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:38,720
that fact but there is like this category of us who have multiple screens.

576
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,240
We work all day at our desk and sometimes it's a very monotonous kind of work you know

577
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,600
a Netflix binge or something like that of a show that's not like crazy important but

578
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,200
you kind of want to watch.

579
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,120
It's perfect for that and I could easily see catching up on Disney content because it's

580
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:59,000
not just Disney cartoons it's everything that monster owns and that would be nice to have

581
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,160
on the desktop and that will create a demand which will lead to piracy and the way around

582
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,140
that is to make it easily accessible legally to paying customers and when you fail to do

583
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:15,420
that there's a lesson the internet teaches companies over and over and over again.

584
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,040
Like somebody should create a podcast that just tracks how many times this happens and

585
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,440
how companies have to learn this lesson over and over again and now Disney's going to learn

586
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,080
it.

587
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:30,600
People's media servers their Kodi boxes will be stuffed full of Disney Plus content and

588
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:35,640
it won't be via a streaming add-on that they've keenly developed for Kodi.

589
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,640
Let's just put it that way.

590
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,800
Well and you mentioned set top boxes there I think that's going to be the predominant

591
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:47,300
way for people to really stream the service just like with many of the other services.

592
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:52,520
So that's the target use case and to their credit Disney Plus does have apps available

593
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:58,780
for both the Android ecosystem and the Apple ecosystem to be able to stream their content.

594
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:04,120
So if you have something like an NVIDIA shield that is Android based you're not left out

595
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:11,560
in the cold but there is something to be said for smart TVs that have Linux baked in to

596
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,920
be able to run content without an external set top box.

597
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,200
Disney needs to cater to that market as well and the way to do that is through Linux.

598
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,040
There are more and more TVs that are running things like web OS that aren't Android based

599
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,580
that perhaps Disney will want to stream to so maybe they will need to reconsider their

600
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,880
support of the Linux platform sooner than later.

601
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:40,120
There was some sort of indication that they are working on the problem but it's really

602
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,720
early days for the service.

603
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,320
They're not transparent on the process and there's been no updates or any progress in

604
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,920
the last month so I'm betting it's a back burner kind of thing.

605
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,320
So it's something to be aware of if you're thinking about subscribing to the Disney Plus

606
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,920
streaming service that you may not be able to watch it on your Linux box for a long time.

607
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,120
Maybe that's not an issue for you.

608
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,920
You've got a set top box no big deal or maybe it is and we wanted you to be aware of it.

609
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,320
That's just sort of the bottom line right now.

610
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:11,840
Well if anything changes with this story or any of the other stories that we've covered

611
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:16,640
