00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,280
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,840
This is episode 49, recorded on April 15th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,840
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,840
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:23,840
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,320
It's good to be connected with you, and sorry if I sound a little sleepy today.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,720
I was up all night playing video games.

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,400
No doubt taking advantage of this new tool made by Feral Interactive called Game Mode.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,400
What can I say, Joe?

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,840
I'm committed to research for every episode of Linux Action News.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,800
Yeah, it's what Aiki calls validation, I think, when he's playing games.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,280
And he actually had something to do with this.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,700
So that's part of the reason I wanted to mention this.

14
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,440
If you look at the GitHub, you'll see that quite a lot of the commits are from Aiki.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,440
Oh, cool.

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,440
I did not actually catch that.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,840
I was too busy actually testing it.

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,600
So let me tell you the basic premises and warn you that it is early days.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:02,800
But the idea is so cool that I could think of it as more than game mode.

20
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,680
I could think of it as development mode.

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,480
I could think of it as system admin mode.

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,440
But in its current incarnation, it's open source.

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,900
And it's from the folks at Feral Interactive.

24
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,140
And they're releasing it ahead of Rise of Tomb Raiders Linux release.

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,040
And it's basic right now.

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,000
It's a multi-part tool that's really designed to just take care of some of the most basic

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,100
performance modes you can get out of your CPU.

28
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,760
It does handy things like it tells your CPU to automatically run the performance governor

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,440
in a mode that is highest performance rather than something like balanced or power saving.

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,280
And it gets kind of neat because it has a front end and a back end.

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,440
And you can set it up to automatically make these adjustments when you launch the game.

32
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:49,680
But they have a plugin architecture as well that could automatically enable other functionality

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,240
down the road when you launch a game.

34
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,520
And for that, the possibilities are endless.

35
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, now another reason I wanted to mention this is because last week we were kind of

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,480
down, weren't we, on Valve with their Steam machines and how Linux gaming in general isn't

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,600
that important to a lot of people.

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,200
But this kind of shows that a big player like Feral Interactive are obviously thinking about

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Linux.

40
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,860
I also like thinking about other ways I could put my machine into a high performance state

41
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,500
by launching just one application.

42
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,120
So with gaming, I could think of plugins I could add to game mode that would make it

43
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,840
really useful.

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,320
Because the governor's stuff, if you're gaming on a desktop PC, you may already just have

45
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,480
this hard set to performance mode.

46
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,800
Why wouldn't you if you're a gamer?

47
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,500
If they could do things like maybe change the Linux IO scheduler or disable my compositor's

48
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,320
full screen effects when a game is running automatically.

49
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,640
You could see lots of different plugins.

50
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,000
Maybe turn off certain services in the background.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,040
When I launch a game, turn off NFS, Samba, and my MB server.

52
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,980
I don't want them taking up extra CPU while I'm gaming.

53
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,860
And then as soon as the game closes, have SystemD automatically bring those services

54
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,920
back up.

55
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,280
Things like that are totally doable, and it's open source so the community can contribute

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
back.

57
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,680
Well, maybe this will turn out to be a big thing, we'll have to see.

58
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,880
But something else we've been pretty down on in the past is ButterFS.

59
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,300
And we've always kind of said, oh, well, ZFS, CFS, that's the way forward.

60
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,800
You don't get any data loss or anything with that.

61
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,680
Well, that's not strictly the case unless you are totally up to date.

62
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,480
This is an interesting bug that cropped up just on ZFS on Linux did not affect the BSD

63
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
variants.

64
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,640
And it's because of a collision with a change in core utils upstream with a change in ZFS

65
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
upstream.

66
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,680
And neither one of them had anything to do with each other.

67
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,680
It's kind of funny.

68
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,640
The ZFS change was related to just handling case insensitive file systems better.

69
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,560
And the core utils change was a change to how CP worked when hashing the files that

70
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,080
it was copying.

71
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,460
These two changes came together to prevent what's called the ZFS attributes file from

72
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,040
expanding properly.

73
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,760
And when that couldn't expand properly and keep track of all the changes, my understanding

74
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,120
is files just essentially got dropped on the floor.

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,600
They were still moved, they still exist, but they were never added to the index of the

76
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,600
file system.

77
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,040
Now, the upstream developers, as of this recording, have a tool that they're working on to add

78
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,040
those files back to the index, so there will actually be no data loss in totality.

79
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,720
But what you get is a collision of two different upstream changes that really came together

80
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,120
and collided on the most recent distributions, the most current RHEL snapshots and its derivatives,

81
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,680
your Gen 2s, your Arch Linuxes.

82
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,520
The Debian derivatives and Ubuntu were not affected because they were on ZFS 0.76.

83
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,140
So the moral of the story here is if you're on a recent or a rolling distribution of Linux,

84
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,600
you need to be on ZFS 0.7.8.

85
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,380
You probably didn't lose any data.

86
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,800
You can look further into the story if you think you might have.

87
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,580
We will have links in the show notes.

88
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,800
You go to linuxactionnews.com slash 49, dig down in there, you will find the link to the

89
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,280
thread where developers are talking about that tool that will pick those files up that

90
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,900
got dropped and add them back into the index.

91
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:15,360
This, I think, Joe, might be our first kind of big ZFS on Linux bug-ish, which turned

92
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,160
out to kind of be not that major, but it's still noteworthy, I think.

93
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,400
It's definitely noteworthy because of the criticism that ButterFS has had in the past.

94
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,120
And I don't know, when you have a file system that is as complicated as ZFS, then surely

95
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,480
you are sort of lining yourself up for these bugs and maybe there will be other bugs in

96
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,480
the future.

97
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,760
Nobody could have really seen this coming, whereas with a much simpler file system like

98
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:47,120
ext4, which is what I use more or less everywhere, or even XFS, you're not going to have these

99
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
problems, are you?

100
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Fair enough.

101
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,480
And I think for a lot of deployments like desktops and laptops, ext4 and XFS are the

102
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,560
file systems to choose.

103
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,380
But the use case of the server, it's a totally different thing here.

104
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,200
So the ButterFS bug that they really got the most criticism for was a flaw with their

105
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,840
RAID 5, if I recall.

106
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:15,940
That is a fundamental design flaw in the file system, where this bug was two upstream issues

107
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,080
that collided.

108
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,720
It was technically, if core utils hadn't made that change, this bug wouldn't have been invoked.

109
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,700
And if ZFS hadn't made that upstream change to be more compatible with case-insensitive

110
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,080
file systems, this bug wouldn't have been invoked.

111
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,140
But it wasn't a design issue with how ZFS writes to the RAID array.

112
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,160
It was simply two upstream projects collided on their changes.

113
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:45,160
Yeah, well, call me a Luddite, but I'm sticking with ext4, even on servers for now.

114
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,720
All right.

115
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,880
You tell me how that works for you when you're dealing with hundreds of terabytes worth of

116
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
data.

117
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Well, yeah, that is true.

118
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,880
That is true.

119
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,960
There are very strong arguments for using these more modern file systems.

120
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,560
But for the kind of deployments that I need, I just can't justify the complication and

121
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
risk basically.

122
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,000
You know, I can't really disagree if your use case doesn't require snapshots and compression

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,400
and deduplication and copy-on-write.

124
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,200
If those things don't even seem like useful aspects of a file system to you, then you

125
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,360
just need a good file system and a good backup, and you're pretty much set.

126
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
Well, yeah, exactly.

127
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,960
I'm not saying that I couldn't take advantage of them, but you have to weigh up these pros

128
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,160
and cons, don't you?

129
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,040
And I think the complication aspect of it, you know, ZFS is something that does so many

130
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:39,080
things that you can potentially do with other tools.

131
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,520
And okay, maybe it's ultimately more complicated to use those other tools, but it's solving

132
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,420
problems that can be solved in other ways that I'm used to solving them in that way,

133
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,420
if that makes any sense.

134
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,800
It actually does make sense to me, because when I'm working on a laptop with multiple

135
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,000
drives or an editing rig that I want to share storage, I find I'm actually still going to

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,200
LVM, more so than, say, a ButterFS volume setup or a ZFS pool.

137
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:12,860
I just know LVM, I know it works, and I just want XFS on my drives and LVM to just bring

138
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,340
all the disks together.

139
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,200
In some ways, I'm a lot like you in that respect.

140
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,160
On my local workstations, if I was dealing with a large enterprise in a data center,

141
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,640
hands down, no doubt about it, ZFS all day long.

142
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,280
Yeah, I think ultimately, I would be as well, but thankfully, I don't have that much data

143
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
to deal with.

144
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,160
Thankfully, it's not your problem.

145
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,400
Yep.

146
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,640
But something that Mozilla is trying to make their problem is the state of the internet,

147
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,760
which they think is not great.

148
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,160
Really, Mozilla is capitalizing on a perfect moment in time.

149
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,760
Mark Zuckerberg just wrapped up his dominance of the news and his testimony for two days

150
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,640
before the Senate and Congress, and the Mozilla Foundation is releasing their report that

151
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:02,280
highlights the dangers posed by companies like Facebook to the internet about the centralization

152
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,560
and concentration of control of how people experience the online world, and they say

153
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,000
it's now in the hands of companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Twitter.

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,800
This is the Internet Health Report, which they did a prototype of back in January 2017,

155
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:23,040
and now they've released, I suppose, what's going to be an annual version of it now.

156
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,680
This is the Rtake part of the show here.

157
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:32,160
I went into this really wanting to like this report, because they start out with calling

158
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,760
out how tracking your personal preferences and targeting ads and sort of making an echo

159
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,280
chamber effect of the internet are bad things.

160
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,040
I am so on board with that concept.

161
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,320
I was like, yep, all right.

162
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,440
I'll grab my pitchfork.

163
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,640
Let me get the kerosene.

164
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,320
I'll get my matches.

165
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,720
I'm ready to go, Mozilla.

166
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,160
You've got my attention.

167
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,840
That's the mindset I went into this report with, and I walked out thinking, what the

168
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,720
hell are they spending their money on?

169
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,720
So they spend a lot of time talking about, quote unquote, fake news, which is a politically

170
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,800
charged term, which immediately kind of gets me upset, because I think of Mozilla as a

171
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,800
technology company, and now they're wandering off into the rabbit hole that never ends of

172
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,280
politics, which can be a continuous money sink for these foundations, and they come

173
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:27,840
back with Facebook dominating the web is a bad thing, Facebook tracking you and violating

174
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:34,160
your privacy is a bad thing, and centralization of the web is a bad thing.

175
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,920
Those are their fundamental takeaways in this internet health report, which they say is

176
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,480
not a metric driven report.

177
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,440
No, no, friends, that wouldn't make any sense.

178
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Instead, it's something that is more of an evaluation of what's helping and what's hurting

179
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,720
the internet.

180
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,360
It should be called state the bleeding obvious report, really, because of course, Facebook

181
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:59,680
is this hub for billions of people who, that's their first port of call.

182
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,280
When they open a web browser, they go straight to Facebook, and then everything goes from

183
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:11,080
there, but for them to start making political statements like these companies should be

184
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,360
broken up and regulated.

185
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,440
Is that really Mozilla's place to start talking about that stuff?

186
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,080
I don't feel like it is really.

187
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,700
Yeah, let's talk about that, Joe.

188
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,100
So that was sort of the takeaway is that fake news is bad MK, and we should probably break

189
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,000
up the monopolies MK.

190
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,320
And again, part of me sits here and reads this and goes, God, they're so right.

191
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,760
Thank God somebody's saying this.

192
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,400
I'll give you a line that I completely understand.

193
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:43,340
They say, the network control of major internet services is only part of the grip they hold

194
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,460
on our lives.

195
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:50,200
The sheer size and diverse holdings a few companies, including Google, Facebook, and

196
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:57,480
Amazon have become intertwined with not only our daily lives, but with all aspects of the

197
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,240
global economy, civic discourse, and democracy itself.

198
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,200
They are too big.

199
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:10,360
And part of me agrees, when I watched Mark Zuckerberg testify in what was almost half

200
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,740
of the US Senate, something really struck me, Joe.

201
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:19,600
With half the US Senate there, you probably had representatives that in total represented

202
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,840
150, 170 million individuals.

203
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:29,720
And you had Mark Zuckerberg, who represented about 2 billion individuals.

204
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:37,080
In a lot of ways, Mark Zuckerberg has more influence over the population than those 44

205
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,160
US senators did in different aspects of their lives.

206
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,640
There's a real sense of power differential.

207
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:49,520
Mark Zuckerberg was the most powerful person in the room of half of the US Senate.

208
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,460
And there is an actuality to that statement that is hard to ignore.

209
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,320
And so to say that Facebook has too much power or too much influence over the internet isn't

210
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,000
an accurate statement.

211
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,680
The real fundamental problem here is that Mozilla isn't bringing up anything new or

212
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,440
isn't giving us anything actionable.

213
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,920
Yeah, because it's a pipe dream, isn't it, to try and break up Facebook?

214
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,160
I mean, that's just not going to happen.

215
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,880
They're an American US company dream.

216
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,460
You know, a kid that started a company in the dorm of his college now is employing tens

217
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,880
of thousands of people, making billions of dollars in revenue with billions of users.

218
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,540
It's a great American accomplishment.

219
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,260
No way you'd want to break that up right now.

220
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,460
You just need to regulate.

221
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,200
And that's where they're going with Facebook, for better or for worse, they're going for

222
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
regulation.

223
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,420
And that's what we're going to watch for a little while, is we're going to watch these

224
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,440
companies fall under different areas of regulation.

225
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,640
You are probably thinking a lot of GDPR these days, Joe.

226
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,600
Facebook and Google have got to respond to that.

227
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,520
Even Jupiter Broadcasting has to respond to GDPR.

228
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,280
So it's going to be a couple of years of this.

229
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,440
But do we need Mozilla to point that out?

230
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,120
It just feels like that's not their place.

231
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,160
I keep saying it, but that's their place is to concentrate on the web, OK, and keeping

232
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,600
that free and everything.

233
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,800
But surely they should be doing that by making a really good browser, not making political

234
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
statements.

235
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,960
Undoubtedly, that's the geek response.

236
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,800
You and I, in our quote unquote production meeting last night over Telegram, I made the

237
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,800
comment, I would have loved if they took the dozen or so people that worked on this report

238
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,320
and just hired one more Thunderbird developer.

239
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,500
One more Firefox developer.

240
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,360
Just give me one more person writing code.

241
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,620
And that's just what I want to see from the Mozilla Foundation.

242
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,200
But they have, if you recall their architecture, they have two different sides, right?

243
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:44,160
They have this sort of more aspirational public foundation aspect of the Mozilla group.

244
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,180
And then they have the development side of the shop.

245
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,040
It really is a right and a left hand.

246
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,680
Yeah, but even if they hadn't hired a developer with the money that they could have saved

247
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,980
by not writing this report, maybe they could have spent that money on advocacy.

248
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,440
They could have paid for someone to go around the world to conferences and sell Firefox

249
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,440
to developers.

250
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,220
I could devil's advocate that.

251
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,400
I could devil's advocate that.

252
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
I mean, that seems pretty clear to me.

253
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,480
You have to have something for them to cite.

254
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,940
You have to give them some source material.

255
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,400
And one does not preclude the other.

256
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,540
You can have a report like this and you can still have advocacy.

257
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:23,080
And having a quote unquote foundational report is usually more credible than somebody's opinion.

258
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,960
So there is a functional aspect to this that they could actually, boots on the ground could

259
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,960
utilize.

260
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,480
Like this could become their weapons of knowledge that they use to convince people's opinions.

261
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,120
I suppose that might be their hope.

262
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,080
I think your first argument is better though.

263
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,600
Is this their job?

264
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,020
And I go back and I'll ask you this question.

265
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,920
If Mozilla doesn't do it, and I'm not saying I want it to be Mozilla, but if Mozilla doesn't

266
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,700
do this, who the hell else is going to do this?

267
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,400
Nobody else is bringing these points up.

268
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,800
I mean, you and I are, and people that just follow this stuff are thinking about it.

269
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:02,160
But there's no large established organization that is making these points in a way that

270
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,300
is consumable by businesses and politicians.

271
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,860
What about the EFF?

272
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,400
This is their line of thinking and this is their kind of beat, but they can only do so

273
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,880
much and they're not talking about this specific issue like Mozilla is in such a refined way.

274
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,920
Because Mozilla is a position of authority on this topic and they have this bullshit

275
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,440
report that sells.

276
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,920
I mean, that's the thing about when you're talking to a business, you're talking to a

277
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,720
politician, having these quote unquote reports that they've worked super hard on and put

278
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,760
a lot of effort into, they're sales material that people eat up.

279
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,760
It starts the conversation.

280
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,760
Yeah.

281
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,280
So Mozilla have got a lot of money sloshing around and they've got to spend it on something,

282
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,160
but I'm still not a hundred percent convinced this is the kind of thing that they should

283
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,560
be spending it on.

294
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,320
human beings that are there and happy to help you whenever you get stuck.

295
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,680
And their hands on scenario based labs that give you experience on real servers so that

296
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:42,480
way when you go take the test or go do the work in the real world, you've seen it before.

297
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,520
You've done it before.

298
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,560
They have six plus Linux distributions that you can choose from the servers and the courseware

299
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,760
automatically adjust to the distribution you want to learn on.

300
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,200
That's my favorite feature of all of them.

301
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,920
And then if you're busy, you got a lot going on, they have a core scheduler.

302
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:03,500
You set a time frame, it'll fit your schedule and they'll create learning goals for you.

303
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,640
And speaking of learning goals, they have a series of learning courseware for specific

304
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,400
goals that you might have in mind.

305
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,200
Like say you want to go down to a very specific niche of an area, they have learning paths

306
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,880
that it's great for that flashcards that get customized by the community.

307
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,120
They have nuggets which are deep dives into single topics when you've got just a little

308
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,180
bit of time.

309
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,520

312
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,680
Okay, let's talk about Android security.

313
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,720
And this week, I saw quite a lot of buzz about this.

314
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:53,520
And that is a fair number of Android OMS are lying about the security patch levels.

315
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,100
So if you go into the about phone or tablet, and then look, you'll see security patch level

316
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,680
and it might say January 2018, or whatever.

317
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:10,080
Well, quite a lot of OMS on certain devices are just telling out and out lies about that.

318
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,340
Yeah, even some of the popular devices.

319
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,280
So this is research that was done by hack in the box.

320
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,800
And they're preparing to give a big demo at a conference in Amsterdam.

321
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,600
And they're from the security research firm security research labs.

322
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,600
And they they're going to give a whole overview of the data.

323
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,280
But wired got early access to it.

324
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,520
And going through it, they found what they call the researchers the patch gap.

325
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:39,180
In many cases, certain vendors phones would just straight up tell users that they had

326
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:43,320
all of the Android security updates, they were good to go.

327
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:49,680
But in a lot of cases, in reality, they were missing as many as a dozen patches.

328
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,640
They had the most recent quote unquote security update, but a subset of those patches would

329
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,720
just simply not be installed.

330
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,280
And so this they've nicknamed the patch gap.

331
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:06,480
They tested the firmware of 1200 phones for more than a dozen phone manufacturers for

332
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,740
every Android patch released since 2017.

333
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,360
From devices that were made by Google themselves, including the pixel devices, and devices from

334
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,520
Samsung down to the lower end lesser known Chinese owned devices.

335
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:26,460
And some like the ZTEs and the TCLs, as well as in the mid range your HTC's and your Motorola.

336
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,200
So it's a wide data sampling that they did this.

337
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,840
And their testing found that other than Google's own flagship phones, like the pixel and the

338
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,800
pixel two, even top tier phones sometimes like ones from Samsung failed to have all

339
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,760
patches installed, and they actually lack some significant ones.

340
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,120
And then of course, as you would expect, lower down the tier, it gets even worse.

341
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,920
Well, it sounds very bad on the surface of things.

342
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,280
But did you see what Google had to say in response to this?

343
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,960
Yeah, I saw Google's response.

344
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,160
So wired reached out to Google and said, What do you guys think about this?

345
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,800
And Google's response was so typical, it sort of bothered me.

346
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,420
First of all, they started with, Oh, we appreciate their research.

347
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:12,620
But they didn't understand the complexity of the Android environment.

348
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,880
That was essentially their response.

349
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,800
And they argued that in some cases, patches may have been missing from devices just because

350
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,320
the phone vendors didn't have those features to begin with.

351
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,120
So there was nothing to patch.

352
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,940
Or you know, some of these devices, they were never even certified by us to begin with.

353
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,280
So you can't blame Android for that.

354
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,880
But the researchers accounted for that.

355
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,940
And their research shows it's in modern devices like Motorola devices, Samsung devices, totally

356
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,820
certified devices by Google.

357
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,640
So in my reading, that explanation barely holds water.

358
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,280
Yeah, but one of the other potential explanations here is that it's not necessarily the OEM's

359
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,280
fault.

360
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,920
If you look at some of the cheaper phones that have like MediaTek processes and stuff,

361
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,040
MediaTek are pretty bad at supplying patches to the OEM.

362
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,760
So what can they do?

363
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,940
Yeah, you are totally right about that.

364
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:08,460
That's one of the things that this research truly demonstrates is that the further down

365
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:15,640
you go on the price, the bigger problem just licensing patches or getting that that silicon

366
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,880
vendor to write code become.

367
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,860
And so if you have a Samsung device and Samsung is creating most of the chips, you are in

368
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,200
the best position.

369
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,320
If your device is loaded full of Qualcomm, you're in the next best position.

370
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,020
It really begins to fall off.

371
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,320
The worst offender is MediaTek.

372
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,740
And now we have research data that clearly shows us that.

373
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:38,520
And one of the things I appreciate about these researchers is they created visualizations

374
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
to demonstrate this.

375
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,080
We'll have a link in the show notes if you want to see that.

376
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,240
And it's so obvious when you see it compared, Samsung is doing the best here as they should.

377
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,800
They have unilateral control over a large portion of the silicon and the software.

378
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,360
And MediaTek is doing the worst, which isn't surprising because they're the budget vendor.

379
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,800
Yeah, whenever I see a phone, I think that it looks all right.

380
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:03,440
And then I look down the specs and see MediaTek say, no, thank you.

381
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
Not interested.

382
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
Yeah.

383
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,960
And this research just justified that.

384
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
Yeah.

385
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,480
Well, you mentioned that Google certifies certain devices and washes their hands of

386
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,480
ones that they don't.

387
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,840
Well, it looks like now with certain custom ROMs, you're going to struggle to use Google

388
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,280
Play services, which if you are totally into freedom and just use an F-Droid, then it doesn't

389
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
affect you.

390
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:28,080
But if like me, you're kind of half pragmatic and you do have Google Play services installed,

391
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,560
then you're going to have one more hoop to jump through when you install LineageOS, another

392
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,680
similar custom ROMs.

393
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:39,040
Yeah, I bet this isn't too surprising to anyone that has been listening to this show for a

394
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,200
few weeks.

395
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:45,000
And we go to the Lineage blog where they have broken down the state of play here.

396
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,240
And they talk about Google Play certification, what it is and how it affects you.

397
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,060
And their explanation of why it was done in the first place reads a little ominous.

398
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:58,140
And they note that this is speculation on their part, but they say that some OEMs may

399
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:05,000
have been shipping devices that contain Google Play services without device certification,

400
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:11,360
which lowers the trust for app developers in being able to rely on the quality of devices

401
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,280
running with Google Play services installed.

402
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,000
Well, may have been shipping.

403
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,680
We know that they have been shipping.

404
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,120
There's tons of devices coming out of China that have got Google Play services and all

405
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,320
the Play Store and everything that are not certified by Google.

406
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,640
Well, this isn't exactly news, is it, that aspect of this?

407
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,840
What's news here is that Google is starting to actually do something about it.

408
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,840
I agree.

409
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,840
It's not news.

410
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,240
In fact, it's super obvious.

411
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,960
To me, that's what's ominous about it.

412
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,900
It to me reads as if the Lineage team heard from somebody at Google.

413
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,760
They came a knocking and this is their response to it.

414
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,280
Well, I don't think it's Google telling them.

415
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,320
I think it's the community because people have been noticing over the last few weeks

416
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,280
that certain devices and certain ROMs are just not working unless you take the Google

417
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:02,880
services framework ID and go and register it on their certification page under your

418
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,880
Google account.

419
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,640
I've actually been keeping an eye on this over the last few weeks.

420
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,920
It's only now that Lineage have actually posted about this that I thought we should talk about

421
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:17,280
it because it was kind of a bit speculative, but now it's there in black and white on Lineage's

422
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,080
blog.

423
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,760
It's a serious issue that people are going to have to deal with.

424
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,920
I mean, I say serious issue.

425
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:28,320
For now, it's just a case of one hoop that you have to jump through, but you talk about

426
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,220
it being ominous and yet it might be a case that Google will just stop Google Play services

427
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:40,680
working if it's not a totally official certified device, which is not very good for people

428
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,960
like me who don't want all the bloat of all the various other Google apps that I don't

429
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
need.

430
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,560
I only need a few Gmail and maps and stuff.

431
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:58,320
I hope, I very much hope that this doesn't kill the custom ROM community because let's

432
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,200
face it, how many people are running Google-less?

433
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
Not very many.

434
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,800
I know one failing from late night Linux, but most people in this whole community, the

435
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,200
first thing they do is flash Google apps.

436
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:16,160
So if that goes away, then it could just totally collapse as a community.

437
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:22,600
You know, a year ago I did an experiment of no G apps on my Nexus device and it didn't

438
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,040
end up working out for me, but I did take away one thing.

439
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,960
I think I could have a two or three day battery life if I take off all of the Google apps

440
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,040
and the Play API.

441
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,520
It's a significant difference in the battery life, huge.

442
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,920
That was my big takeaway.

443
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,200
And so I've always kind of toyed with the idea of doing that again and just getting

444
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:46,120
tremendous battery life out of my Nexus 6P and just extending it even longer.

445
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,120
And I think we are getting a whiff of the way of the future here.

446
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,980
This sort of continues a long-term trend we've seen with Android as they've pulled certain

447
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:59,640
things out of the upstream and they've commercialized certain aspects of the Android ROM.

448
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,920
Now we're going to have an official slot for the custom ROM community to fit in.

449
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:10,120
You're going to be able to be legitimate citizens of the Play ecosystem, congratulations.

450
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:16,480
You're also going to be controlled and over time systematically reduced in capabilities by Google.

451
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,800
And I can't see it any other way.

452
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:23,040
This has clearly been coming and now LineageOS, because they don't want to be crushed by Google,

453
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,680
is clearly playing ball to this.

454
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,280
Yeah, well I suppose we'll just have to stick to the stock ROMs or just not even use Android

455
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,600
at all and just be an Apple fanboy like you and use an iPhone.

456
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Absolutely.

457
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,200
