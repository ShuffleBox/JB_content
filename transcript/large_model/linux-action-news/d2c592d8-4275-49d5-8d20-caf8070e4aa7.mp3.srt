00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,180
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,140
This is episode 66, recorded on August 12th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,140
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,140
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,140
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,140
It's good to be connected with you.

7
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,140
And what do you say?

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:26,420
Should we start things out with a little pie?

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,420
Yes.

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,880
Android version 9 pie has been released.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,320
And it's powered by AI for a smarter, simpler experience that adapts to you.

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,560
I almost believe it now.

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:44,080
Yeah, it seems like all the features are based around this idea of monitoring what you are

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,760
doing with your phone and making your experience much better as a result of collecting all

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,280
that data and definitely not using it to sell you better ads or anything.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,280
No, of course not.

17
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,280
It's all going to be private.

18
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,160
I mean, it does result in things like adaptive battery that I think is actually going to

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,160
be pretty useful and perhaps the app actions, which could be fairly useful.

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,800
But one does wonder what happens with these metrics, even if not much happens now, what

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
happens in the future.

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,720
But you know, there's still a lot of other really, really appealing features to Android

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,820
9 that I thought were worth mentioning.

24
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:22,520
It now supports 802.11 MC, which is a Wi-Fi protocol that lets you use indoor navigation.

25
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,360
It's also known as Wi-Fi Round Trip Time, RTT.

26
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,700
It's a new feature that enables GPS-style tracking by determining your location within

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,700
a building.

28
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:38,560
Again, also useful for tracking you and facilitating turn-by-turn directions to help you get from

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,800
inside the building to the road, which if you think about it, if you're traveling, that's

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,240
kind of useful actually.

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,320
And there's probably a lot of potential uses for that.

32
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,640
Another one that I thought was good was lockdown mode.

33
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,240
It's a mode you can go in now and disable biometrics like face scanning or the fingerprint

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,880
options until you re-enable it.

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,560
That's just maybe useful again for certain folks in certain situations.

36
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,240
Notification channels, which is a revamp again to the notifications and making it easier

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,360
to dismiss ones you don't typically want to consume.

38
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,880
And the last one that I'll pull out right here that I just think is fantastic and Apple

39
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,200
needs it to rip this off immediately.

40
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,120
An auto-rotate button appears in the navigation bar when your phone is rotated to an orientation

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,680
that is not currently locked to.

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,360
So I just do this all the dang time.

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,300
I just prefer to have orientation lock on so that way I don't have any surprise switches.

44
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,760
But then I'll, on the rare occasion, turn my phone horizontally and sit there and shake

45
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,080
it for a second like a monkey before I realize, oh, I have orientation lock on.

46
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,920
But now in 9, a little button will show up in the menu bar.

47
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,500
Where down where you have like your home button and your back button, there will now be an

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,760
auto-rotate button that shows up.

49
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,760
That is going to be really useful when it does finally roll out to everybody.

50
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, and one last bonus extra feature I liked a lot, HTTPS by default.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,600
Yeah, some of it's good.

52
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:03,160
But what about this hand-holding stuff where they talk about like, at the end of the day,

53
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,480
it's going to go grayscale and tell you that you've had enough of using your phone and

54
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
you can set timeouts for apps and stuff.

55
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,760
That to me, if you need a phone to tell you to do that stuff, then maybe just get a dumb

56
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,240
phone or something.

57
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Digital well-being is what they're calling that feature.

58
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,760
They're launching it first on the Pixel phones.

59
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,240
And I do follow what you're saying, like the grayscale mode, the timers that show you how

60
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,200
much time you spent in the apps.

61
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,920
I don't really quite get the idea here.

62
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,080
Here we're going to build these super attractive devices that have all these great features,

63
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,580
and then we're going to build in features to prevent you from using it.

64
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,600
So the incentive seems off from Google's standpoint, and the incentive seems off from the user's

65
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
standpoint.

66
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,440
Why are you spending all this money and time and paying for subscription services for these

67
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,200
devices if you're preventing yourself from using them?

68
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,560
And if you can't self-meter, there's probably something else going on there.

69
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,360
That's my personal opinion, but I had a conversation about this in Linux Unplugged last week, and

70
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,280
I did have a couple people in the mobile room chime up and say, I actually could really

71
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,400
use these features.

72
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,560
I do need a bit of a nudge to tell me to take a break.

73
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,640
I won't do it otherwise.

74
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,680
And so I think it's not that bad.

75
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,500
I'll tell you, the scuttlebutt is that it's the boards of these companies that are forcing

76
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:16,120
them to do these things to try to combat the addictive narratives that are starting to

77
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,920
propagate around these devices and the services that people use on these devices.

78
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,040
So to combat the addictive narrative, they're going with these well-being features.

79
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
That's the rumors.

80
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,960
Yeah, not to mention combating potential future regulation where they'll be forced to do

81
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,960
it.

82
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,160
Why not do it before there's legislation that makes you?

83
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,280
Yeah, that could be it.

84
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,640
And maybe it's something that's not even specific yet, but they could just see coming down the

85
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,000
road and so they figured tackle it now and bake it and get it right.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,620
And for Google at least, it's probably going to be an avenue of a great bunch of insight

87
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,620
for them.

88
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,620
So yay.

89
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,880
Another interesting aspect of the Android 9 rollout is there were more OEMs that participated

90
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,880
in the beta program.

91
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,600
So it's not really just the Pixel devices.

92
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,080
Pretty soon, some Sony devices, YaoMei, HMD Mobile, OnePlus, and the Essential phone will

93
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,960
also receive updates this fall to Android P. So that's nice to see that some other manufacturers

94
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,360
have been included in this process.

95
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,200
It's still a bit of a code dump approach to Android development, but expanding that official

96
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,920
beta program is definitely good for consumers.

97
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:23,880
Well, I'll be interested in this as soon as there's a lineage version for my phone, but

98
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,280
until then, not that interested.

99
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,400
The navigation changes, I'm not interested in at all.

100
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,000
They're talking about removing the back button and having that only show up when you need

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,600
it and there's some potentially pretty wacky UI or UX changes, which I'm just not enthused

102
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,960
about whatsoever and I'm really hoping will stay optional forever.

103
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,800
I imagine they will for a while.

104
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,920
I think I have a different perspective on them just because they've been pretty successful

105
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
on the iPhone X.

106
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,920
I, for a long time, have felt that if UI elements aren't discoverable, if you can't see them

107
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,720
on the screen, they're not going to get used by users.

108
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,960
Hidden gestures just get left unused.

109
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,680
But if you can kind of build in a routine around a couple of them, they do make for

110
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,560
using your device a little bit faster.

111
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,800
The task switcher on the iPhone X is killer.

112
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,760
You can flip through applications as fast as your thumb can move.

113
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,320
And I think bringing that to Android, I'd use it.

114
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,680
Okay, well that's enough about Android Linux.

115
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,760
Let's talk about some proper GNU slash Linux and hardware stuff.

116
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,720
So you are pretty much going to buy a ThinkPad because of this next story.

117
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:31,840
Yeah, that T480 is looking so sweet right now and that's because Lenovo has joined LVFS.

118
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,320
That's the project that we love.

119
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,720
It's the Linux Vendor Firmware Service and it gives Linux users feature parity with MacBooks

120
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,560
and Windows users for firmware updates.

121
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,200
UEFI updates, Intel microcode updates, they come right down to traditional software update

122
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,300
channels like GNOME Software or very soon, Plasma Discover.

123
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,960
And this is a big, big milestone for Lenovo because it has been a major standout feature

124
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,480
of my XPS 13.

125
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,640
I think it's been a fantastic aspect of that little box the entire time I've owned it.

126
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:03,520
I've really advocated other hardware OEMs do this as well because it's a good experience

127
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,240
and it keeps people secure.

128
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,680
It's interesting to see Lenovo doing this when you don't really consider them to be

129
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,160
a big player in the Linux marketplace though.

130
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,560
Well it's funny that when Richard Hughes wrote his blog post about this on the GNOME blog,

131
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,780
he says, if anyone from HP is reading this, you're now officially late.

132
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,280
So yeah, he's kind of looking at them saying you should join as well.

133
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,160
But it's interesting that he also talked about how they kind of had to bend over backwards

134
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,420
for Lenovo here.

135
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,480
They made it a little bit awkward for them.

136
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,100
It's good that it's finally sorted out and they're finally on board with it, but it seems

137
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,200
like they had quite specific stipulations there.

138
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,280
Yeah they talk about working on their back end to bring Lenovo in.

139
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,080
They talk about some changes they had to make to FW update and FW up D and even some changes

140
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,680
to the actual LVFS admin portal itself for very vendor specific reasons.

141
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,600
But that strikes me as part of this process.

142
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,760
Yeah I suppose we're used to this kind of open source collaboration type attitude where

143
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,280
people just get on with it, but we're talking about corporate entities here that can't just

144
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,680
do things like this on a whim, there has to be a process.

145
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,560
So I suppose it's fair enough and the headline is, at least they're part of it now, even

146
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,440
if it took a long time and was quite an effort to make it happen.

147
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,480
There are a couple of exceptions to this list.

148
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:28,080
Anything really pre UEFI is not supported.

149
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,160
The yoga line of products is not supported.

150
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,000
It's your ThinkPads primarily, but some of the more beloved and famous ThinkPads are

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,320
on this list including the T480s, the X1 Carbon and the P series of ThinkPads.

152
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,560
Those are all really great laptops and the ThinkPad X1 Yoga is on the list as well.

153
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,240
So check this, we'll have it linked in the show notes if this applies to you.

154
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,800
Also this list includes all of the other manufacturers.

155
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,200
It's a very extensive list now that are in the LVFS project.

156
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,760
So check that out at linuxactionnews.com slash 66.

157
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,360
Well speaking of Richard Hughes, there's another post from him on the GNOME blog this week

158
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,720
about automatic updates for Flatpaks.

159
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:11,680
Now before you panic, this will be a setting that you can turn off in GNOME software if

160
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,400
you do not want auto updates.

161
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,280
I know one of the first comments that I saw was, I'm on a mobile connection.

162
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,280
Yeah, I feel you on that one.

163
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,920
Don't worry, you'll be able to turn this off.

164
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,140
This is also bringing feature parity to a similar function with snap packages where

165
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,520
they update every 24 hours.

166
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,000
You have to remember, these are all confined applications.

167
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,800
They exist in their own little space.

168
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,640
They don't really touch the rest of your system.

169
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,420
They're not dependent on the libraries on your system.

170
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,420
They don't update the other libraries on your system.

171
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,440
So it's been pretty minimal impact on all of my systems that have snaps.

172
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,720
So I'd probably use this on the Flatpak side and I like that they make it easy to turn

173
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
it off.

174
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,000
They've also announced some other improvements coming along to GNOME software.

175
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Seems like some good stuff is coming down the pipe.

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,760
Yeah, specifically there's a new free desktop runtime for Flatpaks, version 18.08.

177
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,920
Yeah, Alexander Larson is making news this week.

178
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,560
He's a Red Hat employee who has outlined a new runtime option for Flatpak.

179
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:12,680
The free desktop SDK is a collection of things like Python, SQLite, SDL, Vulkan, specifically

180
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,960
Vulkan 1.173 for those of you who care, OpenSSL, and et cetera, a bunch of libraries and tools

181
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,360
that you could use as a base system.

182
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,840
We was asked if maybe it would be better if this was based off of more mainstream distribution

183
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
as a runtime.

184
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,400
So like a Debian runtime or a Fedora runtime.

185
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,640
But the whole point with the free desktop SDK runtime is it's sort of vendor neutral.

186
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,840
It's got a collection of some of the best of open source that you can then use to build

187
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,760
your application on top of.

188
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,840
I like that idea.

189
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,000
I think that, especially for Flatpak, I think that works pretty well.

190
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,440
There's different options, but I think that works pretty well.

191
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,440
And in a way that makes Flatpak stand out as opposed to Snaps, because with Snaps you've

192
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,800
got the specific Ubuntu runtime or this week now we've got the Fedora runtime.

193
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,520
And to have something that is distro agnostic, I think makes it more appealing to developers.

194
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,120
Yeah, I could definitely see that, and I think that's their theory as well.

195
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,080
I would like to see this play out, and that's why I like that we have two approaches right

196
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
now.

197
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,280
Because with the Snap approach, I could see that also being more appealing to developers.

198
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,760
You could go with a Debian runtime, or a Fedora runtime, or an Ubuntu runtime, and those are

199
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,280
environments you're familiar with.

200
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,800
Maybe you've already developed some software in those environments.

201
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,840
Maybe you already have a few things banged out that you're running on your own local

202
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Ubuntu desktop.

203
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:33,080
So being able to start and work with something you already know as a runtime could actually

204
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,720
be more advantageous in the marketplace when you look at the way developers actually work.

205
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,960
We won't really know until we just sit back and watch.

206
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,640
The end users don't really have to worry about it either way.

207
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,760
Whichever runtime the developers are using, they don't really have to care about.

208
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,720
The Snaps or the Flatpaks will just install them.

209
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,040
And a lot of people are kind of waiting for a winner of this war between Snaps and Flatpak,

210
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,360
but it's just not like that at all, is it?

211
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,560
That's not how open source works.

212
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,040
We're not going to end up with one standard.

213
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:08,920
We're just going to have two competing standards that both work equally well.

214
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:15,160
That's where you go to get a $100 credit over a Digital Ocean.

215
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,000
And every system you deploy has enterprise grade SSDs, 40 gigabit connections coming

216
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,980
into the hypervisors, and yes, data centers all over the world.

217
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,200
My favorite thing about Digital Ocean is their dashboard.

218
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,960
I like to mention that because it makes a difference.

219
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,760
The dashboard is so great and the rest of the system is so fast that you can get up

220
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,240
and going in minutes.

221
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,240
And that means you can go from, hey, I've got an idea to, hey, the thing's up in minutes.

222
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,080
And that's sometimes all it takes to actually get going on something.

223
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,360
I think some of the best projects that we've kicked off over the years really on Digital

224
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,200
Ocean have been ideas that we just said, let's go fire up a droplet and take a look.

225
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,320
And then 15 minutes later, we're installing software and we're trying things out.

226
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,900
It's so fast and so convenient that we'll often spin up a droplet before TechSnap and

227
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,520
try something out that we're covering in the show just for research purposes.

228
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,480
And we'll just do it right here in the studio, in my web browser.

229
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,840
As we're looking at a story, we'll just try it out and see if we can replicate the same

230
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,840
thing.

231
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,840
We can do it in minutes.

232
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,920
And they have an API that's super well documented, clean, easy to follow.

233
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,520
Even if you're not a full-time developer, you're gonna understand what that thing does.

234
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,440
But the best part is that means there's lots of open source applications that have already

235
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,680
been created that you can go take advantage of right now.

236
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,280
My favorite system is just three cents an hour at Digital Ocean that gets you four gigs

237
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:39,000
of RAM, two CPUs, an 80 gigabyte SSD, three terabytes of transfer, and it's all for three

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,240
cents an hour.

239
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,520
Three cents an hour?

240
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,040
That's ridiculous.

241
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,480
Go get on some of that with a $100 credit for new accounts at do.co action.

242
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,800
Okay, let's talk about blockchain.

243
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,280
And for once, we're not talking about cryptocurrencies, we're not talking about initial coin offerings

244
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
and scams.

245
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,880
We're talking about a real-world implementation of blockchain technology, which will actually

246
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,960
make a difference to businesses all over the world.

247
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,560
IBM and Maersk, which is the largest shipping company in the world, announced Wednesday

248
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,800
a new platform called TradeLens.

249
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,600
They've roped in 94 firms, and it's all based around the Hyperledger.

250
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,980
Now, Maersk is the largest shipping company in the world, and you're probably familiar

251
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,520
with who IBM is.

252
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,600
They're gonna sell access to the TradeLens platform.

253
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,000
The selling party will contract with the customer and receive all of the fees and revenue rather

254
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,160
than sharing it with the other partner.

255
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,000
This is according to the way the system's going to work.

256
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,880
It's a new model to help companies trade and share contracts, and IBM and Maersk sit back

257
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,560
and take the revenue.

258
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,860
It's built on the Hyperledger fabric, which is a project of the Linux Foundation, an open

259
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:56,020
source project of the Linux Foundation, which has some changes to the way a peer-to-peer

260
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:03,760
blockchain verification system normally works, primarily changes to enable some private transactions

261
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,940
and to take some nodes out of the verification process.

262
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:14,360
They're calling this an open supply chain ecosystem, and they say it's open because

263
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,560
they're publishing about 100 APIs.

264
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:24,600
Really it's just a business-to-business transaction enabler that IBM and Maersk are gonna make

265
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,040
a bunch of money off of, and they've used the Hyperledger fabric to enable it.

266
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,920
It is, like you say, though, a real-world use of blockchain, and it's at a massive scale

267
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
already.

268
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:41,520
It's funny that when I read this story, only minutes before I'd been talking to some friends

269
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:48,560
about blockchain hype and how my example of what a great implementation of it would be

270
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,840
would be for a logistics company, and then boom, I read this headline, read the article,

271
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,720
and then sent them a link to it.

272
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:01,560
It's so easy to dismiss blockchain stories, because that same day I kept an eye out and

273
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,960
I counted four or five other blockchain-based stories which were just ICO stuff and just

274
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,680
hype, whereas this, to me, is an actual concrete example of what that hype is actually all

275
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
about.

276
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,080
The blockchain is basically just a database, but it's distributed, it's cryptographically

277
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,440
signed, so you know that no one can mess with it, it's automatically backed up to wherever

278
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,320
you want it to be.

279
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,880
It's just a next-generation database, really, when you think about it.

280
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,840
That's how I've thought about it for a while, and that's why I've always thought, it'll

281
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:36,660
be a moneymaker, it'll just be in really boring ways that it's a moneymaker, and it does strike

282
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,560
me that it could be like this fundamental enabler of transactions between shipping companies

283
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:47,800
and banking companies and technology companies, and we don't really know the original author.

284
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:53,240
Satoshi Nakamoto is still unidentified, and we're just proceeding right along.

285
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,240
I think that's fascinating.

286
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,120
Well, I'll tell you what's going to be fascinating, watching you scramble to try and replace Dropbox,

287
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,240
which you're going to have to do very soon.

288
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,680
So angry this week.

289
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,860
I always knew this day was coming.

290
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:12,180
I've known this day was coming, and now it has arrived on, well, it will arrive on November

291
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:19,280
7th, 2018, Dropbox is screwing over all Linux users who are not on straight Extended-4.

292
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,760
If you have an encrypted Extended-4 partition, you're out of here.

293
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,120
If you use ButterFS, you're out of here.

294
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,940
If you use XFS, ZFS, you're out of here.

295
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:32,840
They write in their forum post, this is by community moderator Jay over at the Dropbox

296
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,760
forum, he says, we're ending support for Dropbox syncing to drives with certain uncommon file

297
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,760
systems.

298
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,840
The supported file systems are now going to be NTFS for Windows, HFS Plus or APFS for

299
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,760
the Mac, and Extended-4 for Linux.

300
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,960
A supported file system is required as Dropbox relies on Extended attributes to identify

301
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
files in the Dropbox folder and keep them in sync.

302
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,200
We will keep supporting only the most common file systems that support Extended attributes

303
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,720
so we can ensure stability and a consistent experience.

304
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,560
I'm not buying this, Joe.

305
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,680
All right, ButterFS, we can let that go.

306
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,560
XFS, probably not huge for desktop Linux.

307
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:17,120
But XFS, I think is one of the unsung heroes of the Linux file systems.

308
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,280
I've literally been using XFS since the early 2000s.

309
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,200
And it was one of the file systems I chose initially because it supported Extended attributes.

310
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,880
And I needed that to have feature parity on my Samba servers with NTFS.

311
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:38,240
And to say that XFS isn't a mainstream file system, it was introduced with IRIX in 1994.

312
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,120
And it is still a very actively developed file system, even more so in the last few

313
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,720
years, with incredibly great features being added to it still.

314
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,280
And this is just going to force my hand.

315
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,200
I will have to cancel my Dropbox account.

316
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,520
I will have to move to something else.

317
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,480
I have been spinning up a Nextcloud instance for a couple of years now, testing it lightly.

318
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,800
Of course, we've experimented with C file and a lot of other little back-end things

319
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,200
that are just simpler, like rsync jobs and whatnot.

320
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,520
So there's a whole range of different solutions I've experimented with.

321
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,280
And I'll just pick the one that's sort of done the best and move.

322
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,880
But it's pretty disappointing because there are some people I work with remotely that

323
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,920
have this really integrated into their workflow that will have to also make changes.

324
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,880
And you always feel like a jerk when you have to ask somebody to change the way they work.

325
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,760
What, like when you force me to use Dropbox in the first place?

326
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,760
Better than Google Drive.

327
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,220
At least this has a client.

328
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,220
It has a client.

329
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,360
Well, not for me.

330
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,520
I've never installed a client.

331
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,940
I just use the website.

332
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,760
So I could keep using this exactly as I have been.

333
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,760
I know, Joe.

334
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,760
Oh, I know.

335
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,760
I am aware.

336
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,480
And it drives me crazy that this even went somewhat in your direction because you've

337
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,280
been giving me a hard time about it for weeks and months.

338
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,160
But the truth is it is a good service.

339
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,000
But the reality is Linux users just don't represent a large enough portion of the market

340
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,320
to really force these guys to work hard for us.

341
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,760
And if you don't have a company that's committed and they don't have a large enough user base

342
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,680
that makes up their revenue for it, they're just going to constantly be screwing us over.

343
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:12,200
And the only real long-term solution, we all know it, is to use free software solutions.

344
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,200
It's just sometimes the sauce is harder to get off than you expect.

345
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
Well, yeah, definitely.

346
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,680
And you talk about XFS being a mainstream file system, but are there any mainstream

347
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,800
distros that default to it?

348
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,980
Or do you have to format your own partitions and specify XFS?

349
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,440
As far as I know, they all use, well, SUSE and stuff uses ButterFS and Fedora's got its

350
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,200
own complicated stuff, but the likes of Ubuntu defaults to ext4.

351
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,340
So in reality, I don't think that many people are going to be affected by this.

352
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,680
If you are a standard user, then you're going to be using ext4 anyway.

353
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:49,440
Well don't forget, it's also if you have an ext4 encrypted home partition, which a lot

354
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
of people do.

355
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,680
Some distributions do that by default now even.

356
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,680
Well there's always a website.

357
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,000
You can always fire up Firefox and use completely free software to interface with their proprietary

358
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
backend.

359
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,480
Yeah, it's definitely time to switch to something else.

360
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,320
I had tried to make a switch once before and it went horribly wrong, almost resulted in

361
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:12,280
dramatic data loss, but this time there is a serious incentive, that November 7th deadline.

362
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,560
Well I'm sure that you can embrace open source because even Hollywood can.

363
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,680
It's about time.

364
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,240
We know it's always been behind the scenes.

365
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,400
You hear little reports here and there about how Linux or open source was involved in the

366
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,320
production of some big Hollywood blockbuster.

367
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,000
Well now the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, that's the organization behind

368
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,960
the Oscars, announced that it has partnered with the Linux Foundation to launch the Academy

369
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,760
Software Foundation, a new open source foundation for developers in the motion picture and media

370
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,160
space.

371
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,680
And this is a lot cooler than I initially thought it was.

372
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,560
This is sort of the perfect match of a bunch of people that have been underrepresented

373
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:58,420
inside media production houses and the Linux Foundation, who will be running admin for

374
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:04,360
infrastructure for collecting code, checking out licenses, submitting them to GitHub, bringing

375
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,560
stewardship to projects that have been maybe maintained by some gal in a corner of an office

376
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,800
somewhere or some guy in the basement.

377
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,280
They will now be submitted up to the Linux Foundation, they'll review them, they'll check

378
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,920
through them, they'll make sure that everything's documented, the license stuff is right, and

379
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,240
then publish them up to GitHub.

380
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,440
This is sort of great, Joe.

381
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,500
I see a lot of people being surprised by this.

382
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,800
And for me, it wasn't a huge surprise.

383
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:36,160
Hollywood, the motion picture industry, the TV industry, it's all an industry, right?

384
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,520
They're there to make money.

385
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,880
And what do industries do?

386
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,640
They choose pragmatic ways to make more money.

387
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,120
And open source has spread like wildfire over the last 10 or 15 years into all industries,

388
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,040
because it's just better at certain things, and it's just a pragmatic approach here.

389
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,040
And we're not talking about free software, there was no mention of that at all, was there?

390
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,480
This was all open source.

391
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,800
And it's just yet another industry embracing a pragmatic approach to make more money.

392
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:09,440
According to a survey by the Academy, 84% of that industry uses open source software

393
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,300
already, mostly for animation and visual effects.

394
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,480
And there's a quote in here by the Chief Technology Officer of Walt Disney Animations, and he

395
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,240
says, by increasing collaboration within our industry, it allows us to pool our efforts

396
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,700
to a common foundation of technologies, drive new standards for interoperability, and increase

397
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,980
the pace of innovation.

398
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,240
I like all those statements, and I did some investigation into how this is going to work

399
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,920
structurally and practically, and it's pretty solid.

400
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,240
It started really as a conversation between a couple of media companies and the Linux

401
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,880
Foundation just asking for help.

402
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,620
Hey, we've got ourselves a real mess here.

403
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,420
Can you give us some advice on how to dig ourselves out of this?

404
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,480
And over eight or nine months, it developed into this much larger relationship where the

405
00:23:53,480 --> 00:24:00,660
Linux Foundation, I believe, saw a real opportunity here to provide some back end services to

406
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:07,560
do the things that the Foundation can be particularly good at that the artists and creators in Hollywood

407
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,500
are not, because they're focused on making movies and television and etc.

408
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,520
And the Linux Foundation can be focused on the actual open source code that's doing that

409
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
work.

410
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,080
Well, how many times recently have we talked about this very thing?

411
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,880
Distributions like Slackware that are having financial problems.

412
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,120
And the answer to me seems obvious.

413
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,440
Someone like the Linux Foundation or Mozilla, someone who can take care of the admin, the

414
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,720
boring stuff that you don't want to have to deal with.

415
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,480
And this is a prime example of that.

416
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,080
Yeah, I do think it's a bit of a milestone, it feels like to me, though, the fact that

417
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,400
Hollywood has so openly embraced open source in this and is talking about ways to collaborate

418
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,360
between studios on that code and trying to break out where they've created silos or somebody's

419
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,840
been patching something and patching something that hasn't been submitted upstream.

420
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,880
They're trying to resolve those issues as well.

421
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,640
And the fact that's even on their radar as something to be concerned about, I think really

422
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,460
shows you how the world of software has changed, and how open source has really made an impact

423
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,460
everywhere.

424
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,240
Like, that's a massive milestone to me.

425
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,520
Oh, it definitely is.

426
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,160
But let's not get too ahead of ourselves here.

427
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,200
We're not talking about Linux necessarily, and certainly not Linux on the desktop.

428
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,720
I'm sure that all the people who are involved with this will have been talking to each other

429
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,320
and posting these press releases from their Macs.

430
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,840
Oh, Joe, always bringing it back home.

431
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,840
You got to be right.

432
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,640
I mean, I'm sure you are right.

433
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,800
The reality is, at the end of the day, there's still open source code getting used, there's

434
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,080
still software getting made.

435
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,240
I think that's still a good thing.

436
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,960
If they want to open up a terminal from their Mac and necessitate another Linux box to do

437
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:48,080
it, or if they just want to build and run it locally on their Mac, you know what?

438
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,160
I'm happy.

439
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,160
Makes me happy.

440
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,820
I think this is a good move, and I like to see the Linux Foundation doing these kinds

441
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,260
of things where it's not going to be a massive amount of overhead for them.

442
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,680
It's sort of already in their core focus, and it's an obvious area that needs some help.

443
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,080
Yeah, not to mention all that Hollywood cash.

444
