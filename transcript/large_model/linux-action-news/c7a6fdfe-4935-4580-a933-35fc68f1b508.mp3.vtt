Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:15.960 --> 00:20.080
This is episode 45, recorded on March 18th, 2018.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.080
I'm Chris.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
And I'm Joe.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.080
Hello, Joe.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.120
It's good to be connected again and have you back.

00:25.120 --> 00:31.640
And we start out this week's episode with a big new fancy GNOME release, version 3.28.

00:31.640 --> 00:38.640
Yes, which you have celebrated by installing plasma yet again on some more machines.

00:38.640 --> 00:39.640
You caught that, huh?

00:39.640 --> 00:42.960
Yeah, you're not kind of very invested in this anymore, are you?

00:42.960 --> 00:44.880
Well, I did go ahead and kick the tires.

00:44.880 --> 00:51.960
I downloaded the latest OpenSUSE Tumbleweed that is an ISO pre-spun with GNOME 328 and

00:51.960 --> 00:53.700
gave it a go for a few minutes.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.280
It looks really nice.

00:55.280 --> 00:59.840
There's a couple of features in here that I appreciate, some real nice improvements

00:59.840 --> 01:05.520
to the way GNOME handles Thunderbolt 3, some improvements to the file manager that I like

01:05.520 --> 01:06.880
a lot.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.440
But overall, it's just another solid, steady release.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.320
It didn't get me to switch back, I'd say.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.320
But if I was a current GNOME user, I'd be pretty excited about 3.28.

01:14.320 --> 01:21.040
Yeah, the feature that jumped out at me is Boxes, the new ability to download ISOs directly

01:21.040 --> 01:22.040
from that.

01:22.040 --> 01:27.800
This is their VM system, and you can install and test different Linux distros with one

01:27.800 --> 01:29.680
click now, which is pretty sweet.

01:29.680 --> 01:33.600
Yeah, they've also enabled some drag and drop file support for certain virtual machines,

01:33.600 --> 01:36.520
so you can send files for the virtual machines by dragging it in the window.

01:36.520 --> 01:42.520
But that whole download, the ISO automatically feature, probably is the number one thing

01:42.520 --> 01:46.760
I want to try with the OpenSUSE Tumbleweed install that I haven't done yet.

01:46.760 --> 01:54.920
In total, GNOME.3.8 incorporates 25,832 changes that were made by approximately 838 different

01:54.920 --> 01:55.920
contributors.

01:55.920 --> 01:56.920
It's pretty big.

01:56.920 --> 02:01.020
There's all kinds of updates throughout the system, from the calendars app to the media

02:01.020 --> 02:02.480
playback support.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.080
Many of these changes are in photos.

02:04.080 --> 02:08.400
It has a new Import from Device feature, which makes it easy to add photos to your collection

02:08.400 --> 02:13.720
from removable media, like an SD card or a USB drive, or maybe even your camera.

02:13.720 --> 02:17.760
This feature automatically detects devices that contain new images, and it also allows

02:17.760 --> 02:21.080
organizing new images into albums as they're imported.

02:21.080 --> 02:24.720
There's lots of other little nice things in photos too, like new editing tools for shadows

02:24.720 --> 02:27.880
and highlights, as well as just general performance improvements.

02:27.880 --> 02:32.680
These tools, like videos, which now supports MJPEGs, music, which now has better reorder

02:32.680 --> 02:38.560
support and playlists, and games, the application for retro console arcade games, all have also

02:38.560 --> 02:39.840
gotten new features.

02:39.840 --> 02:43.920
Yeah, and they are still doubling down on the touchscreen stuff, aren't they?

02:43.920 --> 02:48.320
The onscreen keyboard's been rewritten and is looking pretty nice.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.760
Yeah, it seems very usable.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.520
It's not going to blow you away with anything different, but it's straightforward.

02:52.520 --> 02:56.560
Oh, I guess also we should mention there's a new application usage.

02:56.560 --> 03:00.720
This is a new application that's a bit of a technology preview now, but the initial

03:00.720 --> 03:05.240
version's pretty functional with what it does have, which includes features for examining

03:05.240 --> 03:10.480
your CPU and memory consumption, and it'll also highlight problem areas, make it easy

03:10.480 --> 03:15.280
to quickly identify what process is consuming a ton of resources without having to understand

03:15.280 --> 03:17.280
how to sort processes and all of that.

03:17.280 --> 03:21.920
But my favorite feature is it also has a disk usage examiner.

03:21.920 --> 03:25.720
I almost always install a tool to do this, a graphical tool to just go through my disk

03:25.720 --> 03:30.400
and tell me what Dropbox folder is ridiculous or my Downloads folder is huge, and it now

03:30.400 --> 03:31.720
has that built into usage.

03:31.720 --> 03:36.520
Yeah, but I do wonder how is this different from GNOME's system monitor that we've had

03:36.520 --> 03:37.520
for years?

03:37.520 --> 03:41.760
I think besides using sort of new technology to render the graphs and all of that, it's

03:41.760 --> 03:42.860
simpler.

03:42.860 --> 03:44.760
It's more designed for human beings.

03:44.760 --> 03:52.160
It's less of PS in a GTK app and more of a friendly front-end user tool.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.160
Fair enough.

03:53.160 --> 03:56.120
Well, I've just used that for years and never had any problems with it, but I do look forward

03:56.120 --> 03:57.120
to checking this out.

03:57.120 --> 04:00.460
I do think it looks decent, but I also don't have any problems with the current tool.

04:00.460 --> 04:01.460
You get both.

04:01.460 --> 04:02.760
Anyway, GNOME system monitor.

04:02.760 --> 04:04.600
Yeah, fair enough.

04:04.600 --> 04:09.600
So there's been another release this week, Firefox 59, which is not as big a release

04:09.600 --> 04:12.780
as 58, but it still has some new features, doesn't it?

04:12.780 --> 04:13.840
This is a big release for me.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.760
It's the one that made me stick with Firefox.

04:15.760 --> 04:20.120
When 57 came out, I started looking ahead a little bit at the nightly builds, and I

04:20.120 --> 04:23.760
saw what was coming down the pipe for 59, and I stayed.

04:23.760 --> 04:30.340
First of all, it's way faster than 57 or 58 for my personal usage, and my favorite feature,

04:30.340 --> 04:34.600
if you want it, it now has client-side decoration support, which you can turn on or off in the

04:34.600 --> 04:35.920
customized appearance area.

04:35.920 --> 04:39.920
Yeah, it's mostly just small changes this time around, but one interesting thing that

04:39.920 --> 04:45.080
they've changed is for private browsing mode, where they are now removing the full path

04:45.080 --> 04:48.800
from referrers, so that will prevent cross-site tracking, which is good.

04:48.800 --> 04:53.980
Yeah, and if you're on one of those distributions that's using an ESR version of Firefox, there's

04:53.980 --> 04:59.520
now an easier way to get the absolute latest version, version 59, as a snap.

04:59.520 --> 05:03.160
Yeah, I was quite surprised to learn that Firefox is now available as a snap.

05:03.160 --> 05:07.440
It seems like something that would have been available for quite a long time, but it comes

05:07.440 --> 05:12.920
at the same time as Chromium as well, so now you can get both browsers as snaps.

05:12.920 --> 05:19.600
These two snaps, Firefox and Chromium, will be more valuable as LTS releases and stable

05:19.600 --> 05:23.720
distributions age, so say three years from now.

05:23.720 --> 05:27.560
It's going to be really great that you might be able to have an ESR version of Firefox

05:27.560 --> 05:32.120
as provided by your distribution's repository, and then when you need to test something perhaps

05:32.120 --> 05:37.060
for work or you just like the newer browser, you can go grab the snap, and it won't mess

05:37.060 --> 05:39.660
with your local distros packages at all.

05:39.660 --> 05:40.660
You can have both.

05:40.660 --> 05:44.480
Yeah, and it's kind of another step towards everything being a snap, isn't it?

05:44.480 --> 05:48.560
We had kind of said at the beginning of the year and end of last year that this is going

05:48.560 --> 05:53.080
to be the year of snaps, and it seems to be coming true pretty much all the major applications

05:53.080 --> 05:54.840
now are available that way.

05:54.840 --> 05:59.720
Snaps, flat packs, either way I'm a happy camper, and I would just really love to see

05:59.720 --> 06:04.800
down the road Google step up and publish a snap directly themselves of Google Chrome.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.320
You know, the one that can play like Netflix and stuff like that.

06:07.320 --> 06:08.320
That would just be useful.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.560
I don't know if I'd actually ever use these snaps myself.

06:11.560 --> 06:15.260
I tend to run distributions that just have current packages, but I know there's a group

06:15.260 --> 06:18.760
of users out there, especially on the corporate desktop, they're going to use the heck out

06:18.760 --> 06:19.760
of these.

06:19.760 --> 06:23.360
Yeah, I think Chrome makes a lot of sense as a snap because with it being proprietary,

06:23.360 --> 06:28.880
the distributions can't distribute it, so there's always going to have to be a third

06:28.880 --> 06:35.080
party way of installing it, and snap is just so trivial to install that you think that

06:35.080 --> 06:36.080
they would do that.

06:36.080 --> 06:39.720
Now, you would imagine that Canonical have been working with Google on that, and there's

06:39.720 --> 06:44.740
probably some stuff going on behind the scenes, so it wouldn't surprise me if we had Chrome

06:44.740 --> 06:47.440
very soon, but we'll have to see on that one.

06:47.440 --> 06:50.920
Speaking of making your web browser run a bit faster, good news for those of you that

06:50.920 --> 06:56.720
are crazy enough to run one on a Raspberry Pi, the 3B just got a little bit faster.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.160
Yeah, the 3B Plus is now available.

06:59.160 --> 07:05.520
The 3B is still available for people who have designed it into products or whatever, but

07:05.520 --> 07:09.760
anyone who's using it as a desktop or just a general tinkering board will definitely

07:09.760 --> 07:15.480
be wanting to buy this new one because it's got much faster network, both ethernet and

07:15.480 --> 07:25.200
Wi-Fi, and it's got a slightly faster clock speed, improved boot from USB and pixie booting,

07:25.200 --> 07:26.840
improved thermal management.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.600
It's just generally an improvement over the 3B.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.280
This is really the Raspberry Pi I've been waiting for.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.080
So yeah, like Joe said, there's a slight increase.

07:34.080 --> 07:40.280
It's a 200 megahertz increase in peak CPU frequency, but the big improvement here is

07:40.280 --> 07:41.280
the networking.

07:41.280 --> 07:46.520
It's three times the wired and wireless network throughput than the previous models, and it

07:46.520 --> 07:51.480
now has a better ability to sustain those high periods of throughput for longer periods

07:51.480 --> 07:52.480
of time.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.080
There's a couple of things at play here.

07:54.080 --> 07:58.600
There's now a gigabit ethernet adapter on this board with a caveat that they're quite

07:58.600 --> 07:59.600
upfront about.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.460
It is running over a USB 2 bus.

08:01.460 --> 08:06.600
That's why you're just seeing a 3X improvement in speed, but it's pretty great.

08:06.600 --> 08:10.560
And one of the ways they're getting improvement on the network throughput and on the processor

08:10.560 --> 08:13.160
is we now have thermal plating on there.

08:13.160 --> 08:18.440
The BROGCOM chip has a thermal spreader on it, and the Wi-Fi chipset is encapsulated

08:18.440 --> 08:24.140
under a metal shield that's embossed rather fancy with the Raspberry Pi logo, which allows

08:24.140 --> 08:31.680
them to certify the entire board as a radio module under the FCC rules, which will significantly

08:31.680 --> 08:36.440
reduce the cost of conformance testing for Raspberry Pi-based products, products that

08:36.440 --> 08:38.340
have a Raspberry Pi built in them.

08:38.340 --> 08:39.440
That's a big deal right there.

08:39.440 --> 08:44.840
So not only are we getting better thermals, but we also have easier certification for

08:44.840 --> 08:47.040
radio-type workloads for the Raspberry Pi.

08:47.040 --> 08:49.620
Yeah, and we didn't mention that the price hasn't changed either.

08:49.620 --> 08:56.160
It's still the $35 price, which makes it a very attractive proposition to build into

08:56.160 --> 08:58.360
other devices, doesn't it?

08:58.360 --> 09:03.360
Because if they've paid for the certification for you already and it's only $35 for the

09:03.360 --> 09:07.680
board, it's kind of a no-brainer at that point if you're building a product that needs an

09:07.680 --> 09:09.160
onboard in it.

09:09.160 --> 09:13.280
Another nod to the Raspberry Pi 3B Plus getting ready for more different types of industrial

09:13.280 --> 09:17.720
workloads is if you get the right hat, the sucker now supports power over Ethernet.

09:17.720 --> 09:20.280
That's going to open up to a wide range of use cases.

09:20.280 --> 09:24.000
Yeah, that hat isn't actually available yet, but it will be shortly, apparently.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.880
And yeah, that does seem very useful to not have to have a power supply.

09:27.880 --> 09:32.840
You can have network and power over one cable, which makes it really easy to put in awkward

09:32.840 --> 09:33.840
places.

09:33.840 --> 09:34.920
So yeah, it's good to see that as well.

09:34.920 --> 09:39.120
Just a quick public service announcement in case you end up picking up the 3B Plus.

09:39.120 --> 09:44.360
They note that it uses more power, so make sure you get a high-quality 2.5 amp power

09:44.360 --> 09:48.080
supply and don't run it on something that can't deliver that or else you're going to

09:48.080 --> 09:49.080
have the crashes.

09:49.080 --> 09:53.000
Yeah, they've kind of crept that power demand up, haven't they, with each new release, and

09:53.000 --> 09:56.240
this one is the most power-hungry so far.

09:56.240 --> 10:00.640
And one criticism that I've seen is that it's still only got one gigabyte of RAM.

10:00.640 --> 10:06.420
Now that is a limitation of the chipset, unfortunately, so until they make a major revision there,

10:06.420 --> 10:11.200
it's going to be stuck with one gigabyte of RAM, which kind of, these days, feels a little

10:11.200 --> 10:13.680
bit not enough, doesn't it?

10:13.680 --> 10:15.700
Ah, geez, Joe.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.960
Back in my day, I had 16 megs of RAM and I was happy.

10:18.960 --> 10:24.800
Yeah, but this is 2018 and, you know, even running a server or something, unless you

10:24.800 --> 10:28.840
want to be swapping out all the time, you're going to need more than one gig of RAM, really.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.160
Ah, dang it, Joe.

10:30.160 --> 10:33.560
Get off my lawn.

10:33.560 --> 10:38.600
But I don't know whether I'm going to buy one or not, because I've got a 3 and I don't

10:38.600 --> 10:43.960
use it that much, but one of the reasons that I don't use it very much is this network bottleneck,

10:43.960 --> 10:50.800
and as they allude to here, that it's not only a bottleneck of 30-odd megabits per second

10:50.800 --> 10:56.360
or whatever of a wireless, it's the fact that it can't continuously deliver that much throughput

10:56.360 --> 11:00.320
because it just kind of dies and then comes back, dies and then comes back as it gets

11:00.320 --> 11:04.480
hot or something, and now they've addressed that problem, as well as making it faster,

11:04.480 --> 11:09.880
it suddenly makes it much more useful to me, but it's not even that much money, but it's

11:09.880 --> 11:13.220
just more the clutter of it, really, because I'll end up buying it and then just using

11:13.220 --> 11:16.800
it for a while and then not using it, so I don't know.

11:16.800 --> 11:23.040
I think I'll probably end up with one eventually, but if they rev the RAM, I think that's when

11:23.040 --> 11:28.240
I would be probably looking to buy another one, but for now, I'm not going to buy one

11:28.240 --> 11:29.240
anytime soon.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.240
What about you?

11:30.240 --> 11:34.080
You know, I have been tempted recently to use the open-source project Crankshaft and

11:34.080 --> 11:38.560
make a Carputer out of the Raspberry Pi, and now that there's one that's just slightly faster,

11:38.560 --> 11:42.720
I was already tempted, and now it's just a little bit faster, I'm even more a little

11:42.720 --> 11:45.440
bit tempted, so I might actually pull the trigger.

11:45.440 --> 11:49.780
I do have the same problem that you have, I've got a Raspberry Pi right across the table

11:49.780 --> 11:53.800
from me that I haven't used in a solid six months, and it looks at me, and that's why

11:53.800 --> 11:57.800
I was tempted to do the Carputer, because I'm like, I'll use you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

11:57.800 --> 12:00.780
I've neglected you, little Raspberry Pi.

12:00.780 --> 12:03.560
And what that tells us, Joe, is when those are sitting around our tables, is that we're

12:03.560 --> 12:05.560
just not coming up with enough projects for them.

12:05.560 --> 12:08.840
It's our fault, not the Raspberry Pi's.

12:08.840 --> 12:16.760
dio.co slash action digitalocean.com DigitalOcean is simplicity at scale.

12:16.760 --> 12:21.420
You can spin up infrastructure in seconds, and they built the entire system with simplicity

12:21.420 --> 12:24.840
at the forefront, so managing infrastructure is simple.

12:24.840 --> 12:30.920
If you're an expert or a total beginner, you're going to be at home, dio.co slash action.

12:30.920 --> 12:33.800
For a limited time, if you go there, you'll get $100 credit.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.120
Now it lasts 60 days, you have to have a valid credit card on file, and it's a new account.

12:37.120 --> 12:41.860
A couple of caveats, but I wanted to let you know, because $100 credit is a special opportunity

12:41.860 --> 12:42.860
over DigitalOcean.

12:42.860 --> 12:47.180
Typically, we give out $10 in credit, and that will get you really far.

12:47.180 --> 12:51.800
Two months for free on the DigitalOcean platform if you run the $5 a month rig, which is even

12:51.800 --> 12:55.360
better than ever, because DigitalOcean has recently revised their droplet plans to make

12:55.360 --> 13:01.560
them even more competitive, and they've introduced flexible droplets, which you can mix and match

13:01.560 --> 13:04.920
resources depending on what your application actually needs.

13:04.920 --> 13:08.720
You need a little more disk, or you need a lot more CPU, you can mix and match depending.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.460
And I think that's why they're introducing the $100 credit, because they really want

13:11.460 --> 13:16.680
to give you an opportunity to play with this stuff, do.co slash action to get that.

13:16.680 --> 13:21.680
Everything is SSD based, eight data centers around the world, a dashboard that is so straightforward

13:21.680 --> 13:24.120
and easy to use, you'll be spinning up things for fun.

13:24.120 --> 13:28.280
And if you get stuck, and one of their pre-built systems, which they have many, doesn't fit

13:28.280 --> 13:35.200
your need, they have over 1800 tutorials that have been professionally edited and composed.

13:35.200 --> 13:39.680
It's a fantastic resource, do.co slash action.

13:39.680 --> 13:47.840
Mix DigitalOcean infrastructure in less than 55 seconds, do.co slash action.

13:47.840 --> 13:51.680
So it's been quite a bad couple of weeks for Bitcoin, hasn't it?

13:51.680 --> 13:58.440
And one story that jumped out at me was a city in New York State, Plattsburgh, has banned

13:58.440 --> 13:59.440
Bitcoin mining.

13:59.440 --> 14:05.600
Well, that's the headline, but it's new Bitcoin miners aren't allowed to set up shop there,

14:05.600 --> 14:10.280
at least for 18 months, because they've got pretty cheap power there.

14:10.280 --> 14:13.600
But they've only got a limited supply of that from a hydro dam.

14:13.600 --> 14:19.440
They've put an 18 month ban on any new Bitcoin miners, I guess it's been blown up over there,

14:19.440 --> 14:21.240
because like Joe said, cheap power.

14:21.240 --> 14:24.480
And the problem is when they exceed what they can generate themselves, they have to go out

14:24.480 --> 14:26.640
on the market and buy the power.

14:26.640 --> 14:33.000
And that raises the rates for all of the utility subscribers, sometimes by quite a bit.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.040
Obviously that needs to change.

14:34.040 --> 14:38.240
The average consumer shouldn't be penalized from the Bitcoin miners using all the power,

14:38.240 --> 14:39.640
they should just be paying more.

14:39.640 --> 14:43.440
And I have a suspicion that's what they're going to be working out over the next 18 months

14:43.440 --> 14:46.280
is how they're going to pay more for this stuff.

14:46.280 --> 14:49.800
It's the exact opposite of what's happening here in Washington.

14:49.800 --> 14:53.480
In one small town in my home state, Washington, it's called Wenatchee.

14:53.480 --> 14:58.640
They also have really low cost power because again, hydro electricity, and they have cool

14:58.640 --> 15:00.080
temperatures.

15:00.080 --> 15:03.780
And that makes for a great combination to mine Bitcoin.

15:03.780 --> 15:07.020
And Wenatchee has seen what they're calling a gold rush.

15:07.020 --> 15:09.740
Only in this case, the local businesses are sort of capitalizing on it.

15:09.740 --> 15:15.120
They're creating stores for these businesses that have now employees that mine Bitcoin,

15:15.120 --> 15:17.300
they sell goods in Bitcoin.

15:17.300 --> 15:22.200
It's sort of an interesting little micro Bitcoin experiment that's happening right here in

15:22.200 --> 15:23.200
my home state.

15:23.200 --> 15:28.080
It sounds like they might use this 18 months to implement some sort of license scheme or

15:28.080 --> 15:34.000
something, which is more regulation, which will probably drive the price yet further

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
down.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.040
Because I can see if they implement it in this one town, then it could end up being

15:39.040 --> 15:42.140
implemented in other towns in the US.

15:42.140 --> 15:46.080
Because it is a huge power draw, and that is something that has to be addressed.

15:46.080 --> 15:52.360
I suspect that these mining operations, these large scale data center size mining operations,

15:52.360 --> 15:55.580
would be more than happy to pay for their fair share of the power usage.

15:55.580 --> 16:00.280
At least here in Washington, over in Wenatchee, they are producing 50 Bitcoins per day on

16:00.280 --> 16:04.240
average, at least this is back in July, when the story ran.

16:04.240 --> 16:09.400
Something tells me they've got the overhead, even when Bitcoin's around $7,000 or $5,000.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.920
If they're getting 50 per day, they have the overhead to pay for that power.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.800
Yeah, but it's not necessarily just about paying for it, is it?

16:15.800 --> 16:21.360
And it's not even just Bitcoin mining and other cryptocurrencies.

16:21.360 --> 16:26.360
You're moving into a world where we're using fewer fossil fuels and more stuff is going

16:26.360 --> 16:28.400
electric, like vehicles, for example.

16:28.400 --> 16:33.460
And the infrastructure required for that isn't really there at the moment.

16:33.460 --> 16:38.760
You can't just expect to suddenly add a load of more demand and expect the infrastructure

16:38.760 --> 16:40.440
to be there to deal with it.

16:40.440 --> 16:44.520
And if we're going to have a future where there's a lot more of these cryptocurrencies

16:44.520 --> 16:50.440
and it becomes a standard thing, then that's yet another demand on the electrical system

16:50.440 --> 16:52.820
that they're going to have to deal with somehow.

16:52.820 --> 16:57.880
I don't really tend to get too concerned about the power concerns because I don't feel like

16:57.880 --> 17:00.140
we have enough perspective.

17:00.140 --> 17:05.240
What is the Bitcoin power draw versus the power draw of air conditioners, for example?

17:05.240 --> 17:09.360
And there's also stories that have run recently, surprisingly, like, for example, this one

17:09.360 --> 17:15.060
over at Vox.com on February 27th that says, this Tennessee Valley electricity utility

17:15.060 --> 17:18.440
is freaking out because demand has been flat for years.

17:18.440 --> 17:23.380
And they quote several utilities in the United States that actually say they have more supply

17:23.380 --> 17:25.220
than they have power demand.

17:25.220 --> 17:26.960
I wouldn't have thought that was the case either.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.460
That contradicts everything I've heard.

17:29.460 --> 17:34.820
But it's a really well cited article by Vox that talks about how a lot of these private

17:34.820 --> 17:39.020
utility companies are losing money right now because there's simply not enough demand for

17:39.020 --> 17:41.160
the power that they have for the inventory.

17:41.160 --> 17:47.000
So I don't feel like we have a big enough perspective on how Bitcoin powered consumption

17:47.000 --> 17:53.780
really compares to other things like air conditioners or Tesla charging, or even just running the

17:53.780 --> 17:57.260
dryer all day doing a large load of laundry.

17:57.260 --> 18:00.220
These are big numbers, but I don't really know how they compare.

18:00.220 --> 18:03.920
Yeah, and if the price keeps going down, then it's going to be a moot point anyway, because

18:03.920 --> 18:07.020
everyone will stop mining eventually once it gets slow enough.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.020
Fair enough.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.020
That probably will just solve it right there.

18:09.020 --> 18:10.860
It's a self-correcting problem, Joe.

18:10.860 --> 18:16.100
Well, speaking of solving problems, Let's Encrypt solves the problem of HTTPS being

18:16.100 --> 18:17.100
everywhere.

18:17.100 --> 18:23.160
And they've taken another big step this week towards that by rolling out wildcard certificates.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.780
Very excited about wildcard certificates.

18:24.780 --> 18:28.460
It's something that Jupiter Broadcasting has been waiting for specifically, but not just

18:28.460 --> 18:30.000
wildcard certificates.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.060
They've also rolled out ACME version two.

18:32.060 --> 18:37.240
Now, ACME is the Automated Certificate Management Environment Protocol.

18:37.240 --> 18:41.120
And it's an interface that can be used by a variety of client software packages.

18:41.120 --> 18:46.740
You need open source packages in your repo to automate verification of certificate requests.

18:46.740 --> 18:50.140
This is pretty great, because not only do we get the wildcard support, which, again,

18:50.140 --> 18:55.140
personally excited about, but with ACME version two, it's an IETF standard.

18:55.140 --> 18:59.460
And it's had a lot of input by the industry, and it's got a draft in front of the Internet

18:59.460 --> 19:02.580
Engineering Task Force standard body right now.

19:02.580 --> 19:06.260
So it may not be in its final form, but it's going to be something that Let's Encrypt has

19:06.260 --> 19:09.140
helped push forward for the entire industry to use.

19:09.140 --> 19:13.140
And I have a sense there'll be a lot of open source software written around ACME to automate

19:13.140 --> 19:14.720
a lot of this stuff for us.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.200
And it really has worked, doesn't it?

19:16.200 --> 19:21.740
Their mission to make everything HTTPS, because even on cheap cPanel hosting sites now, they

19:21.740 --> 19:25.900
have no excuse not to offer a Let's Encrypt certificate.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.020
And that's usually one click.

19:27.020 --> 19:31.300
I did one this week, actually, for a little site that I take care of.

19:31.300 --> 19:34.220
And it just goes to show that it has worked.

19:34.220 --> 19:40.260
They set out to make everything HTTPS, and now, OK, not quite everything yet, but we

19:40.260 --> 19:41.780
are certainly getting there.

19:41.780 --> 19:45.420
And now with this wildcard thing, it's just going to make it that little bit easier for

19:45.420 --> 19:46.420
people.

19:46.420 --> 19:48.020
And that's got to be a good thing, hasn't it?

19:48.020 --> 19:51.060
The more HTTPS, the better.

19:51.060 --> 19:52.160
100%.

19:52.160 --> 19:56.900
Not only is it about SSL, but more than that, it's about identity verification.

19:56.900 --> 19:59.200
And that's why HTTPS matters.

19:59.200 --> 20:03.900
We have some additional details and some caveats about using Let's Encrypt's wildcard SSL

20:03.900 --> 20:10.420
certificates in episode 359 of TechSnap, TechSnap.Systems slash 359.

20:10.420 --> 20:14.160
Additional details and some caveats in that episode about this.

20:14.160 --> 20:18.700
But all in all, I am really positive about Let's Encrypt doing this.

20:18.700 --> 20:22.820
This momentum, like you've mentioned, Joe, going in this direction is really positive

20:22.820 --> 20:23.820
for the web.

20:23.820 --> 20:26.740
It's really positive for identity verification and e-commerce.

20:26.740 --> 20:28.100
Yeah.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.740
So what about uninterruptible power supplies?

20:30.740 --> 20:35.820
We don't have an open hardware one of those yet, but maybe we will quite soon.

20:35.820 --> 20:36.820
Yeah.

20:36.820 --> 20:40.160
As Eric Raymond put it, yes, ESR, they're ready for disruption.

20:40.160 --> 20:44.380
And after reading his rationale, he is so right.

20:44.380 --> 20:45.420
And they've started a project.

20:45.420 --> 20:47.780
He and a group started a project called Upside.

20:47.780 --> 20:52.420
It's currently defining requirements and developing a specification for a high quality UPS that

20:52.420 --> 20:58.080
can be built from off the shelf parts in any reasonably well equipped makerspace or home

20:58.080 --> 20:59.740
electronics shop.

20:59.740 --> 21:04.260
I have a little bit of background in the solar and inverter industry.

21:04.260 --> 21:09.220
I had a client that is pretty famous in the inverter and solar industry, and they built

21:09.220 --> 21:11.780
all of their own UPSs there in shop.

21:11.780 --> 21:13.620
And we had pretty significant runtime.

21:13.620 --> 21:17.800
I'm talking like 18 hour runtime off the batteries they built.

21:17.800 --> 21:22.540
And they would use their inverter controllers to really monitor the health of the batteries,

21:22.540 --> 21:26.440
the charge that they were taking, how much they were putting out when we were using them,

21:26.440 --> 21:28.060
how long they were going to last.

21:28.060 --> 21:31.180
It was superior to any commercial solution at the time.

21:31.180 --> 21:33.020
And they built them on their own.

21:33.020 --> 21:35.100
So when I saw this, it really clicked for me.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.900
I didn't realize that the off the shelf ones were so bad.

21:37.900 --> 21:42.780
But from reading what he has to say about them, they're really just the absolute bare

21:42.780 --> 21:43.780
minimum, aren't they?

21:43.780 --> 21:46.200
They just make them as cheap as possible.

21:46.200 --> 21:51.220
And so you can see why he wants to start this new project to have an open standard for them.

21:51.220 --> 21:54.160
Yeah, there's all kinds in the industry.

21:54.160 --> 21:56.820
And the more expensive you go, sometimes the fancier you get.

21:56.820 --> 21:58.940
But again, he's going for something that anybody could get.

21:58.940 --> 22:01.700
And some of the requirements they have, I really agree with.

22:01.700 --> 22:06.020
Smart charging, which the circuitry built in will be more than just a constant trickle.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.820
It needs to be aware of the batteries charge so it doesn't degrade it.

22:08.820 --> 22:13.440
The batteries should be more sophisticated than lead acid, maybe lithium ion or something

22:13.440 --> 22:14.440
like that.

22:14.440 --> 22:18.880
The open source UPS should be able to deliver 300 watts for 15 minutes as a bare minimum.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.260
And the UPS should fail into a bypass mode.

22:21.260 --> 22:26.140
That means the power remains active rather than off, which a lot of UPS has just failed

22:26.140 --> 22:31.340
to, which brings down your system, which is the exact opposite of why you have a UPS on

22:31.340 --> 22:32.340
it.

22:32.340 --> 22:33.340
Yeah, that's terrible.

22:33.340 --> 22:37.220
I can't believe that any of them would fail to an off position.

22:37.220 --> 22:41.440
Surely that's just the first thing that you would build into it that it would fail on

22:41.440 --> 22:42.780
rather than off.

22:42.780 --> 22:46.580
My assumption would be that you're trying to avoid damaging the equipment by under delivering

22:46.580 --> 22:47.580
voltage.

22:47.580 --> 22:49.700
I suppose that makes sense.

22:49.700 --> 22:52.300
But it's getting a main supply into it.

22:52.300 --> 22:55.740
So surely there's a way to just bypass all the innards of it.

22:55.740 --> 22:56.740
Yeah, exactly.

22:56.740 --> 23:02.220
And like ESR points out, if you combine that with actual data over the USB bus, like output

23:02.220 --> 23:08.260
voltage, discharge current, the temperature of the battery, you can start to predict behavior

23:08.260 --> 23:11.340
of the battery and essentially get a smart battery.

23:11.340 --> 23:15.140
And when you use that data, you can avoid things like random ass battery failure that's

23:15.140 --> 23:16.140
totally unpredicted.

23:16.140 --> 23:19.540
Yeah, well, I'd quite like to build one of these once the standard is published.

23:19.540 --> 23:20.700
So yeah, looking forward to that.

23:20.700 --> 23:22.300
Yeah, we'll have a link in the show notes.

23:22.300 --> 23:26.100
If you'd like to check it out, go to linuxactionnews.com slash 45.

23:26.100 --> 23:29.700
Okay, so let's end on a runs Linux.

23:29.700 --> 23:34.300
And this week, Will Wheaton runs Linux what?

23:34.300 --> 23:38.820
This is one of those beautiful blog grants where he takes to the web and says my Windows

23:38.820 --> 23:41.540
machine which began running Windows 10 pretty great.

23:41.540 --> 23:45.100
He thought it was a decent OS after a while began to run so slow.

23:45.100 --> 23:49.740
He thought somebody put a 386 in there.

23:49.740 --> 23:54.260
And so he installed Debian, which is quite a strange choice for someone who's not that

23:54.260 --> 23:55.260
experienced.

23:55.260 --> 23:58.780
I think he got there because he started with system testing tools to try to do troubleshooting

23:58.780 --> 24:00.760
on his hardware to find if something is wrong.

24:00.760 --> 24:02.540
And then everything just worked under Linux.

24:02.540 --> 24:04.600
And so he just took it a step further, loaded it up.

24:04.600 --> 24:08.940
And he says, after 17 minutes of trying to install Linux, I had my system booted.

24:08.940 --> 24:12.180
And I was using a desktop that just worked the way I expected.

24:12.180 --> 24:18.300
I ran into a couple of idiosyncrasies that I'm not crazy about, he says, mild frustrations,

24:18.300 --> 24:21.720
things like Twitter is painfully slow in my web browser.

24:21.720 --> 24:25.220
And I can't watch Netflix or Hulu because of stupid DRM.

24:25.220 --> 24:27.240
And I think he's using Chromium.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.980
Perhaps he should get a snap of Google.

24:28.980 --> 24:30.700
Oh, wait, Google.

24:30.700 --> 24:35.580
But it's cool to see someone high profile like that using Linux and blogging about it.

24:35.580 --> 24:38.180
It's got to be good for the whole community, isn't it?

24:38.180 --> 24:39.940
Yeah, it'll be an exciting journey to watch.

24:39.940 --> 24:44.300
And I bet he'll have no shortage of people reaching out recommending ways to get Netflix

24:44.300 --> 24:45.300
working.

24:45.300 --> 24:46.500
Yeah, yeah.

24:46.500 --> 24:47.500
Install Windows, probably.

24:47.500 --> 24:53.940
He also said he tried an iMac and that he wasn't too impressed with either.

24:53.940 --> 24:57.280
But you know, Joe, everybody eventually comes around to Linux.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.820
You can't avoid it.

24:58.820 --> 25:02.060
It's that slow, eventual takeover.

25:02.060 --> 25:06.040
Well, I'm sure we'll be keeping an eye on developments as Will continues his Linux journey

25:06.040 --> 25:08.680
and of course, with everything else that's going on.
