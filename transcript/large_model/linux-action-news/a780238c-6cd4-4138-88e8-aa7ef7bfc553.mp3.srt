00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,440
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,380
This is episode 57, recorded on June 10th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,380
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,380
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,380
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,860
It's good to be connected with you one last time from Austin, Texas.

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:32,140
And we're going to start this week's episode with news that was still reverberating at Texas

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,800
Linux Fest this weekend.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,880
It's Microsoft buying GitHub.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,640
Yeah, this was brewing just before we recorded last time, but it became official on the Monday.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,200
And it seems to have sent shockwaves throughout the whole FOSS community, doesn't it?

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,160
Shockwaves might actually be putting it mildly.

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,160
Even though it's sort of cliche to say it, it really is true.

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,480
It was probably the number one conversation starter at Texas Linux Fest is what do you

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,680
think of Microsoft buying GitHub?

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,120
And then everybody had an opinion.

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,480
And you've seen that also reflect online.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,000
And they are pretty varying opinions from people bailing from GitHub to GitLab or something

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,200
like it, to people thinking that perhaps it's going to be a good investment long term and

20
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,280
that GitHub was going to get purchased anyway, so it might have well been Microsoft.

21
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,960
And a couple of interesting points were brought up.

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,640
A few folks said to me, well, I'm just glad it's not Google, and I'm just glad it's not

23
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
Amazon.

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,240
But I think for myself right now, I'm sort of in a wait and see period, curious to see

25
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,280
what Nat Friedman does with it, and I could see it going good or bad.

26
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,320
I think ultimately, it's not a good thing.

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,320
When Microsoft gets involved with anything, it's not a good thing, is it?

28
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,200
And I think that if I had any code on GitHub, I would be migrating it or at least backing

29
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,640
it up on another service like GitLab.

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,680
But I think that not much is going to change, at least in the short term, because they can't

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,840
afford the ill will of making huge changes to it right now.

32
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,320
The changes that we're going to see are going to be over probably two, three, four, five

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:07,120
years where these Microsoft features and connections to Azure and stuff are going to be sort of

34
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:14,080
drip fed into it bit by bit, and then it may become unrecognizable down the line.

35
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,440
I don't think that's fair to say, though, because I don't think it will be unrecognizable.

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,120
I think that the core functionality will still remain, and I think that they're just going

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,320
to add stuff to it that most people who don't want it will just be able to ignore.

38
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,440
It is hard to say where GitHub would have gone in the future had they remained independent,

39
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,240
which may have been my preference, but Microsoft still would have had substantial influence

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,740
over the platform.

41
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:44,520
If you just look at the raw numbers, Microsoft has almost 5,000 unique committers to different

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:51,240
open source projects on GitHub, 5,000 different employees at Microsoft that are committing

43
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,160
to different projects.

44
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,320
That's a huge number.

45
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,040
Yeah, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they have influence over the platform.

46
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,200
See, I disagree.

47
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
I think it does.

48
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,020
I think, and Microsoft points out that they're the most active organization on GitHub.

49
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,160
They're the biggest company on there with two million commits.

50
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,720
I think it's naive to say that the largest creators or the largest providers or whatever

51
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,580
category we're talking about of a service, whoever's the biggest customer to that service

52
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,240
has influence over the platform.

53
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,240
I've also noticed a definite split.

54
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,960
A lot of the developers I've talked to through CoderRadio's email inbox, but also here at

55
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,860
Texas Linux Fest, they're sort of nonchalant, I guess.

56
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,120
They're more wait and see, but a lot of the enthusiasts, people that have enthusiast projects

57
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,800
or are not necessarily full-time developers, they seem to be reacting more negatively.

58
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,200
I think a lot of people who just use this as a tool to do their work, and they may be

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,760
already using other Microsoft tools, they're not nearly as concerned.

60
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,080
People that were using it as a place to store a passion project seem to be much more concerned,

61
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,280
and I think maybe those people needed a good reminder about centralization of services

62
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
to begin with.

63
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,480
Well, I remember in the predictions episode that we did at the end of last year, you talked

64
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:08,800
about this split between pragmatists and idealists, and I think that this is a perfect example

65
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,000
of that.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,200
People's reaction does seem to be quite polarized between, meh, whatever, and the sky is falling,

67
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,160
we need to move off to GitLab straight away.

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,860
I think that you're right, it is more of the passion projects, the free software people,

69
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,680
but then you have to question, as you said, why were they on there in the first place?

70
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,500
Because it is not a free software platform, there are big parts of it that are proprietary,

71
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:44,440
and maybe it's a good thing that it's shaken them into realizing that they probably oughtn't

72
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,440
to be there.

73
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,880
I mean, that said, I would have definitely moved my code off there, or at least backed

74
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,840
it up, as I said, so I could see why they've done that, but I think that the bigger, more

75
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,200
pragmatic projects are just not going to do that, are they?

76
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:05,000
They're just going to see what happens, and it is decentralized enough, it's quite a hassle

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,400
to move away from GitHub, but because Git itself is potentially decentralized, you can

78
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,000
migrate relatively easily.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,220
I want to go back to a point you just made, though.

80
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,120
Why were they on there in the first place?

81
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,840
Why are they using Slack?

82
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,140
Why are they using Discord?

83
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,760
I think this is a great time for open source projects and free software to look at the

84
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,880
different services they're using, the centralized services, because it's likely Slack's going

85
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,400
to get bought one day, too, and then are we going to have another round of freakouts?

86
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,540
Do we learn nothing from this lesson?

87
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,920
This is a great moment to stop and reevaluate, and I don't think this is a loss for GitHub.

88
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,600
I don't think these projects that are concerned about this were the right fit to begin with.

89
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,600
They probably should have been on a different self-hosted platform to begin with, so I think

90
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,480
this will balance itself out.

91
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,760
We'll probably stop talking about it in a few months.

92
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,880
Just around then, Nat Friedman will actually take over towards the end of the year, and

93
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,640
then things, I think, will start to get interesting.

94
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,320
But what do you think about this $7.5 billion price tag?

95
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,600
Yeah, isn't that something?

96
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,280
Now that's in stock for Microsoft.

97
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,640
That's Microsoft's stock value of $7.5 billion, but the way these Azure services seem to be

98
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,200
selling, that's probably going to be going in the right direction.

99
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,900
That's a huge number, and I've heard it's many multitudes larger than their actual revenue

100
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,900
and worth.

101
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,360
Well, yeah, if you look at how many premium subscribers they have and stuff, it's just

102
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,840
nowhere near that.

103
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,920
It seems to be massively overvalued.

104
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,720
Is it just because Microsoft have just got all the money in the world that can just afford

105
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,120
it, or have they seen something that the rest of us haven't?

106
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,680
Well, I think a lot of us have seen it.

107
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,920
I just don't think anyone's made a move on it.

108
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:45,840
Think about where GitHub sits in the workflow, how central that is, and how it sits between

109
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,480
many different services.

110
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,440
It's really a valuable position.

111
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,400
Because they were an independent operator for so long, they're built into so many workflows

112
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,800
from the AUR to people deploying their websites.

113
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,200
It's such a key part of software development for so many different shops, and it's been

114
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,200
so platform agnostic for so long that that made it very valuable, because the developers

115
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,340
could use it as sort of this middle layer.

116
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,800
And I think Microsoft had realized that because they put so much of their stuff on there.

117
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,240
I had a couple of little birdies tell me from Microsoft that they're going to mutiny if

118
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,520
Microsoft screws this up, because so many people now inside Microsoft use it for their

119
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,760
own projects, plus the projects they're contributing to that are open source, that if Microsoft

120
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,840
were to mess it up, it would destroy their workflow internally.

121
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,520
Well, yeah, that's another reason why they aren't going to screw this up, or are very

122
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,600
unlikely to, along with the goodwill factor.

123
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,960
They don't want the ill will from developers all over the world.

124
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,840
There are people, especially in our circles, who have freaked out and moved away, but all

125
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,800
the pragmatists that we talked about, they are probably quite skeptical and keeping one

126
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,000
eye on it and will be ready to jump ship if major changes are made.

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,360
So it's not just the people within Microsoft that are probably, you know, half planning

128
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
a mutiny.

129
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,320
But it just seems so unlikely that they would do that.

130
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,760
They wouldn't have spent that much money on something that they wanted to fundamentally

131
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760
change.

132
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,480
I was joking at Texas Linux Fest when people would start the conversation, and sort of

133
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,380
the way I would wrap it up is I'd say, if I were Microsoft, I'd take all this money

134
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:27,680
that I have and I just set some aside and say, we're just going to let this run just

135
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,960
to prove to all those skeptics that we weren't going to screw it up.

136
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,920
And they'll just do it to make a point.

137
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,320
This could be their way to buy reputation long term into the software development community

138
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,560
and specifically the open source, maybe not free software, communities.

139
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,360
And so they could really just play a long game here of proving everyone wrong.

140
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,240
And that would almost be worth the purchase in itself.

141
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,480
Well, yeah, and it's not likely to lose value, is it?

142
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,600
So they could probably offload it at some point in the future if they had to.

143
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,680
And there'll probably be at least a small amount of revenue coming in, it'll probably

144
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,800
pay for itself.

145
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,560
So yeah, it seems like a relatively small price to pay.

146
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,320
I mean, it's a lot of money, don't get me wrong, but for Microsoft to buy that Goodwill,

147
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,600
potentially not.

148
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,920
But if they do mess it all up, we can all revolt by switching to React OS.

149
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,600
One of the best little projects out there just got even cooler.

150
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,400
Yeah, it's not been long since we talked about React OS and you tried it out and were very

151
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,000
impressed with it.

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,480
And they've hit a major milestone now.

153
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,320
It can be built by itself.

154
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,400
So rather than having to use Windows or another Unix-like system to build it, you can do it

155
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,800
from within React OS.

156
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,360
So it's a self-hosting operating system now.

157
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,640
Yeah, and it will create a live CD for you.

158
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
It'll mount it.

159
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,560
And they say in their tweet to announce it, it even builds with a USB stack, which just

160
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,560
is so Windows.

161
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
It's wonderful.

162
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,180
The thing is, though, this is a milestone that iOS devices haven't even reached yet.

163
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,720
So it's pretty impressive if you think about it in that context.

164
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,120
Well, yeah, and Android.

165
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Can you build that on Android?

166
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
I don't think you can.

167
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Can you?

168
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,520
You know, I've made that claim before.

169
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,940
And then we got a bunch of well, actuallys where people had all these different ways

170
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,160
they can pull it off.

171
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,700
So I don't think there's an official way, but people seem to have figured out a way.

172
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,640
But I can't think of a way you could do it with iOS.

173
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,600
Yeah, and look how mature that is as an operating system.

174
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,080
But I think that says more about the control that Apple want to have over it rather than

175
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,960
the technical limitations of it.

176
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,640
So really, what it is, this is all building.

177
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,440
This is one of the many things they're building towards ReactOS 0.49, which will have general

178
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:43,760
kernel fixes, shell improvements, and really some good bug fixes to the Win32 subsystem,

179
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,120
as well as your favorite, Joe, those little balloon pop-up error messages that they sort

180
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,080
of started with Windows 7, you know, the little down by the.

181
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,160
I just love this project, and it's so cool.

182
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,760
And so this is part of it, is getting ReactOS to a place where it can build itself.

183
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:06,060
The developers can now start continuing to just develop on ReactOS and actually create

184
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,060
new builds right there.

185
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:11,160
But we as end users have the benefit of being able to generate those live CDs.

186
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,360
I think this is really neat.

187
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,580
And think about the possibilities for building rescue systems for your friends and family

188
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,600
in the future.

189
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,760
It's going places, Joe.

190
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,480
Well, yeah, if they're lucky, they might even get bought by Microsoft, eh?

191
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,560
Speaking of going places, TrueOS seems to be going into new territory.

192
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,960
And there's a bit of a fork at play here.

193
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,680
We're not quite sure exactly what the situation is.

194
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,840
I'm sure our friends over at BSD Now will update us when they return from BSD Can.

195
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,520
But it appears there's a shift in focus for TrueOS.

196
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,840
Yeah, they say that they're going to focus on a core operating system, but then they

197
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,040
clarify that, no, it's not going to be called CoreOS.

198
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,640
They know there's already something that exists with that name.

199
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,540
But it isn't clear, really.

200
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,720
The communication is a bit muddled.

201
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:07,480
They talk about it becoming a downstream fork of FreeBSD and much more of a general OS rather

202
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,760
than the desktop OS that we're used to.

203
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:17,760
And in order to have a desktop-focused version of it, they are creating a new project called

204
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Project Trident.

205
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,760
Right.

206
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,400
So they essentially have two new systems here.

207
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,840
TrueOS is turning into something else.

208
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,620
And the desktop version that was TrueOS is becoming Project Trident.

209
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,800
And Project Trident is going to continue to be sort of a FreeBSD graphical-based Lumina

210
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,360
desktop project led by Chris Moore, producer of Q5SYS from Jupiter Broadcasting.

211
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,280
I believe Chris Moore's brother, as well as another individual.

212
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:48,680
They're going to continue Trident, which will be a Lumina-based FreeBSD desktop.

213
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:55,720
And then TrueOS over time, they say, is going to go modular, more core-centric, perfect

214
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:02,920
for do-it-yourself advanced users that will use OpenRC and LibreSSL.

215
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,400
And it'll have a JSON-based manifest, integrated procedure and package tools, and a bunch of

216
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:13,980
other things that you can use to reproduce systems for mass deployment.

217
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,680
And it seems to be an effort to, as they actually put it, innovate on FreeBSD and make it more

218
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,680
modern.

219
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,880
Well, that somewhat answers the question as to what value this adds over FreeBSD.

220
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:32,000
But it was always about being really easy to use and being a sort of hassle-free way

221
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,800
to get into BSD, whereas if it's now going to be potentially more powerful and more configurable,

222
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,520
it's going to be much less easy to use for people, isn't it?

223
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,640
So at that point, surely you would just use FreeBSD.

224
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,920
This is like the tip of the iceberg of some of the questions I have.

225
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,600
Like it's really, there seems to be some sort of fork here.

226
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,440
There's a separation of the teams.

227
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,580
Chris Moore, who was originally involved with the founding of TrueOS, will no longer be

228
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,580
involved with it.

229
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,120
I just have a bunch of questions.

230
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,560
I did reach out to Alan Jude and our friends over there to see if they could give us the

231
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,740
scoop because they were at BSD Can.

232
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,600
But they're traveling back right now from it.

233
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,720
So when he lands, I might get an update from him.

234
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:16,440
And if I do, I'll try to slip it into this week's Linux Unplugged.

235
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,680
deo.co action.

236
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:24,340
That's the landing page to get a $100 credit to try out DigitalOcean for 60 days when you

237
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,280
sign up with a new account.

238
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:31,080
It's a simple and scalable computing platform with industry-leading price to performance,

239
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,040
predictable costs, and optimized types of compute.

240
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,880
You can get my favorite rig for $0.03 an hour, or you can go grab their $15 a month where

241
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,920
you mix and match the components to exactly what you need.

242
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,720
But for me, personally, $0.03 an hour is what I go with.

243
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,360
And then if I need a system with additional storage, I attach that block storage, and

244
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,440
it works fantastic.

245
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,600
DigitalOcean also has data centers all over the world.

246
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:58,600
They have enterprise-grade SSDs, they have a great API, and they have a fantastic dashboard.

247
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,320
It makes it simple for beginners or experts to deploy systems in minutes.

248
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,360
They have cloud firewalls that block the traffic at the edge devices so it never even touches

249
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,160
your rig, and they have 40 gigabit connections coming in to the hypervisors.

250
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,600
Plus, they have add-on things like monitoring, alerting, that you can check on to see what

251
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,040
the performance of your rig is, 99.9% SLA because that's just how DigitalOcean rolls,

252
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,820
and fantastic documentation, and a huge community.

253
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,680
And they support tons of open source projects.

254
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,800
I really think they should have a page where they just list a few of the projects because

255
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,220
I just met half a dozen this weekend where their infrastructure is provided by DigitalOcean.

256
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,760
So they're a fantastic member of the open source community.

257
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,040
It's a great value with predictable pricing, and when you go to dio.co slash action, you

258
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,840
can get a $100 credit to try it out for free for 60 days when you sign up with a new account.

259
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,140
It's mind-blowing.

260
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:55,220
As somebody who used to go throw huge servers into racks and pay thousands of dollars for

261
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,480
a T1 connection, I just can't even believe what I'm seeing today, and you can try it

262
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,800
out for a long time with a $100 credit when you go to dio.co slash action.

263
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:14,260
Okay, so there's been a bit of controversy in the KDE world this week.

264
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,160
The maintainer of Kaywin, Martin Fleursa, has stepped down.

265
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,920
Yeah, bit of a shame, isn't it?

266
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,240
I really respected Martin.

267
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,560
He's obviously a very knowledgeable developer, and I've always liked reading his posts about

268
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,580
the rationale behind some of the decisions they've made from Kaywin, and I've always

269
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,480
appreciated that he's been willing to get in the conversation.

270
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,720
So I think it is a loss, but things do change, and he says, I currently really just follow

271
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
up on reviews.

272
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,680
I hardly contribute code anymore.

273
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,200
I think it's time to pass the torch, he writes, and we'll have his resignation letter in the

274
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,280
show notes if you want to read it, linuxactionnews.com slash 57.

275
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,120
But he goes in and says, there's current things that I'm concerned with with the direction

276
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,240
of the Plasma Desktop and the project in general.

277
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,040
And he says, but in the end, I'll still be around, and I'll still be helping out.

278
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,240
So it's nice to see this, and I say, here's the concerns.

279
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,360
Here's what I think of somebody who's been here for a long time.

280
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,160
This is something we need to be talking about.

281
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,240
I'm not rage quitting.

282
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,520
I'll still be around, but good luck.

283
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,520
I'm passing the torch.

284
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,800
Yeah, it's good to see him not just storming off, although he does make some quite strong

285
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:25,200
points in here, specifically about the VDG, the visual design group, talking about how

286
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:31,400
they make decisions without consulting the relevant domain experts, and he's just not

287
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,520
happy with how they have been working.

288
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,720
Yeah, and you know, the strongest point I think he tries to make in his resignation

289
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,720
letter is he says they're on the road to KDE 3's problems with configuration nightmares

290
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,520
and unmaintainable code.

291
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,040
He's worried that they're too focused on trying to make everyone happy, and instead of just

292
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,300
trying to focus on like 90% of making everyone happy and keep everything maintainable and

293
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:57,480
keep it tight and long term, that would be more sustainable, and he thinks that was the

294
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:02,040
initial direction of the project, but they've deviated from those goals in an effort to

295
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,440
just try to get as much usability baked in as the project could possibly get, is get

296
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,240
as much visual uplift as possible, get as many features to make as many people happy

297
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,360
as possible, and he thinks that's not the right direction.

298
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,740
But did you see the comments from Alessandro Longo about how the idea that the visual design

299
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,120
group is one entity is a bit spurious?

300
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,920
Yeah, I agree, and also I think that a large part of the Plasma Desktop's current success

301
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,040
and the reason why it appeals to me is because a lot of the work the visual design group

302
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:37,120
has done, and I think it is an important part of the project.

303
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,800
You know, perhaps it's just a changing of the guard, where there's a shift now where

304
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,500
the visual design group has a little more sway, has a little more influence because

305
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,060
of their success, but he may still have valid points that they still have to consult domain

306
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:53,560
experts and make sure things are done correctly from a technical standpoint.

307
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,640
Both parties are probably in the right in this particular case.

308
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,900
Yeah, that's probably the case.

309
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:04,320
But one thing that's great about the KDE project is their involvement with the community.

310
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,500
And Plasma Mobile is one of the most exciting aspects of KDE.

311
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,740
It's to me one of the best things that they're working on, but it has suffered a little bit

312
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,360
from onboarding issues and getting people involved with it.

313
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:25,080
And so now they have decided to try and make that process easier and have launched Find

314
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,460
Your Own Way.

315
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,360
This is actually a pretty good milestone to see the project getting to, where they've

316
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,600
gotten to a point where they can look back at themselves and say, what are the barriers

317
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,720
to people getting involved with our project?

318
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,800
In their post, they talk about streamlining onboarding of new contributors, setting up

319
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,200
three new goals, working with the KDE promo team and all of that.

320
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,480
But the overarching goal here is more contributors to the project, getting more information about

321
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,720
devices, and really just try to get the word out still.

322
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,520
I think it's a great first step.

323
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,320
And if you look at the website, it's so simply laid out.

324
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,680
Do you want to help us with outreach?

325
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,680
No.

326
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,400
Is there anything else I can do?

327
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
System development.

328
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Oh, yeah.

329
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
Tell me more about it.

330
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:09,620
And then it's broken down into further categories, and it's a really simple way to get people

331
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,620
to the right place where they need to be on Fabricator.

332
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:18,400
So I'm hoping that more developers and just contributors generally will be attracted by

333
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,280
this because Plasma Mobile, for me, is one of the great hopes for mobile Linux.

334
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,920
And I really want to see it succeed.

335
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,320
And anything that is going to make that more of a reality, I think it's got to be a good

336
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,320
thing.

337
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,700
And we round out the show this week with a story about Dev1.

338
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,720
They have a brand new release, ASCII 2.0, which I was so excited to try out for this

339
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
here show.

340
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,000
I loaded over a MiFi and set it up in a VM while my laptop was on battery just so I could

341
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,520
kick the tires, Joe.

342
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,520
Wow.

343
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,720
That's commitment.

344
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:55,640
I did not expect Dev1 to get to a 1.0 release, never mind a 2.0.

345
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,820
So color me shocked, quite frankly.

346
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,680
This of course is the fork of Debian that has no system D. There's a little bit of an

347
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,320
asterisk there.

348
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,280
There are some little bits of system D in it to some extent, but it is mostly system

349
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,980
D free Debian.

350
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:21,480
And it is pretty much just Debian Stretch, except with no system D in it.

351
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
Right.

352
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
Debian Stretch.

353
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
Debian 9.

354
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,160
In other words, the Debian that was released on June 17, 2017, almost exactly a year ago

355
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,900
as we record this episode.

356
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,720
And that's really kind of where the fun begins with this distribution.

357
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,120
I really encourage you to give it a go.

358
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,680
Go ahead and give it a download.

359
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,320
I love my first experiences, you know, when you're in the live environment.

360
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,800
And it's like, OK, this isn't too bad of an XFC experience.

361
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,160
I kind of enjoy this.

362
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,000
So I go and fire up the graphical, quote unquote, installer.

363
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,080
And I'm immediately hit with a question.

364
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,280
Would you like to use SU or sudo?

365
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,060
Note, this does not affect how you administer your system.

366
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,240
And that's all I get.

367
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,960
I don't know if I would want to use sudo or SU.

368
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,880
So thinking I like root all the time, I hit SU naturally.

369
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,840
Then it prompts me for the root password, which is accessible in a text document that

370
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,360
you double click on the desktop that opens it up in a terminal text editor.

371
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,600
So you can read the username and password once you read the manual.

372
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,580
Now it's a typical tour password, so not too surprising there.

373
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:26,840
So once I type in my password, it starts the installation.

374
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,480
And then I check the boxes of things I want, like do I want a home partition?

375
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,680
Do I want to use encryption, stuff like that.

376
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,320
And then it says, OK, choose your partitioner.

377
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,600
Would you like to use gparted?

378
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,080
How about fdisk?

379
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,140
And you then proceed to set up your disks.

380
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,140
And it's just a great time.

381
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,820
I encourage any of you to give it a go.

382
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,680
For extra bonus points, try setting it up on a high DPI monitor.

383
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
That's extra fun.

384
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,520
Do I detect a hint of sarcasm in your voice here?

385
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,400
It was enjoyable from the standpoint of like when I went to the Computer History Museum

386
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,600
and I got to see a whole bunch of old systems and see them operating.

387
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,900
And it was enjoyable from that standpoint.

388
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,040
It was comical from a standpoint of somebody who wants to sit down and get their machine

389
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,640
going and get working immediately.

390
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,360
I'm clearly not their demographic, but I could see somebody who wouldn't mind going through

391
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,360
that.

392
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,360
It was sort of fun in a way.

393
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,380
Well, I had a go at that live image that has the installer in it, and it just didn't work.

394
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,060
It went through it all and then just wouldn't boot from that partition.

395
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:25,680
So then I downloaded the installer image, and that was just Debian, as far as I'm concerned,

396
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,960
a rebranded Debian with no system day, of course.

397
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,000
And it's got XFC by default, which I love.

398
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,020
So I could actually use it once you get the installer image rather than the live one.

399
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,960
I installed it today on hardware.

400
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,960
I could easily continue setting that up and tweak it just the way I want it, and I'd be

401
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
happy to use it.

402
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,020
I wouldn't even notice the difference really between that and a regular Debian.

403
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,720
Of course, there's no GNOME available for it.

404
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,200
There's various other desktops, including Mate, which I tried out, and that was all

405
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
fine.

406
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,320
But GNOME has got the dependency on system day, hasn't it?

407
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:10,040
So yeah, I don't think this is aimed at the mainstream Linux audience, is it?

408
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
No, no.

409
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,320
But the name is great, ASCII.

410
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
That's fun.

411
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,440
And there was one thing I did not get a chance to play with before the show is they have

412
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:23,720
options for, quote, console productivity with hundreds of CLI and text utilities.

413
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,040
I would love to know more about that.

414
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,320
I did not get a chance to play with that.

415
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,480
And the other thing that I thought was just sort of neat is since they're ripping out

416
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,720
system D, you get to pick what init system you want to use.

417
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,320
So you get to pick different init systems with dev1 and version 2.0 ASCII.

418
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,520
I know they're trying to make a practical old style Unix admins distro, but it's turning

419
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,480
out to be like a fun experiment in how like an alternative reality version of Linux could

420
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,560
have gone in a parallel universe.

421
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,640
Well, it seems to have an audience.

422
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,400
Otherwise it wouldn't have got to 2.0, would it?

423
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,080
I expected it to wither and die.

424
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,480
And it seems to be going relatively strong.

425
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,840
OK, it's a little bit behind or a fair bit behind the Debian release schedule.

426
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,720
But there must be people using this, man.

427
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,880
It seems it's found a bit of a home with some embedded devices because I count five derivatives

428
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,600
of the project now and a couple of them are for like microservice, small like network

429
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
machines.

430
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,520
And they've got official images for stuff like the pie as well.

431
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,080
So it's being used by more people than you would imagine, I think.

432
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,680
Well, I hope they enjoy themselves.

433
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,680
More power to them.

434
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,680
I had some good fun with it.

435
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:37,680
I just want to say thank you to everybody who came out and said hi at Texas Linux Fest.

436
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,100
Lots and lots of fans of the show there, Joe.

437
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,280
Everybody talked about Linux Action News.

438
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,280
So that was super cool.

439
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,600
We got we had many great meetups, actually, who had several nights of great meetups.

440
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
It was a ton of fun.

441
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,480
And my journey now continues on.

442
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:53,720
I'm heading up to Keller, Texas, to meet up with Linux Academy at their office.

443
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,160
So you can continue to follow my journey at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash Rover.

444
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,480
And this is my last show from Austin, Texas.

445
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,200
Yeah, and I had a great time at Foss Talk Live last night.

446
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,480
That's why I sound a little bit hungover today, I'm afraid.

447
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
No, no.

448
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,800
Yeah, I know, right.

449
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,000
And met a ton of listeners there of, you know, the various shows that I do.

450
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,760
So yeah, that was really cool.

451
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,600
And check out fostalk.com for the various live shows that were recorded there.

452
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,520
They'll eventually get posted there.

453
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,440
And yeah, if you didn't come this time, do come next year because it was a real blast.
