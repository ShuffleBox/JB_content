00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,280
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 157, recorded on October 3rd, 2020.

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,280
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,280
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,280
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,280
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,160
And we start this week with our own October surprise.

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,280
It seems some open source developers are not really enjoying DigitalOcean's Hacktoberfest

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,480
this year, and they claim they're drowning in spam pull requests.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,840
Now full disclosure, DigitalOcean does sponsor one of my shows, but I do think this is a

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,120
little bit unfair on them.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,760
A lot of people have been pretty hostile to DigitalOcean about this.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:45,280
And I do think that the whole Hacktoberfest thing is them trying to do good for the community

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,040
and obviously promote their business at the same time.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,880
I think it's just sort of naivety rather than malice that's caused this problem.

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,320
This has been going on for a while.

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,920
This is the seventh Hacktoberfest that originally launched in 2014.

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,240
And the setup works is you get a certain kind of pull request in and a certain kind of window

18
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,360
of time and you get swag.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,300
This year, things are a little different.

20
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,080
First of all, I suppose you have more people at home.

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,120
So there's maybe more people that are participating, I guess.

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:19,120
But the other thing that's certain is DigitalOcean limited the amount of shirts that would be

23
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,240
issued to something like 70,000 or 40,000.

24
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,960
I mean, just some incredible number.

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,520
But it meant there was a limited amount you could get, so you better get on it.

26
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,080
I think it's important to kind of keep the numbers in perspective here.

27
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,280
What we're talking about is some projects that are getting spam pull requests in the

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,320
range of a dozen or so, and in the worst case, maybe a dozen or so a day, when the register

29
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,200
looked into it, they saw that there was currently 1,136 pull requests that seemed to be related

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,980
to the Hacktoberfest.

31
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,640
That was as of October 1st.

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,580
So it's not a tsunami, as some are calling it.

33
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,580
But it's enough.

34
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,500
And when you consider that each one of those then sends off generally a notification email

35
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,560
to everyone who's watching the repository, and then each one of them might come to check

36
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,880
on the status of it, it does actually add up very quickly into lost time.

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,920
And this is something that I've not really figured out how to talk about.

38
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,620
Because I think this is a really common problem in free software, is really well-intentioned

39
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:24,000
people that have reach attempt to do something good and help projects, but what they really

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,760
do is kind of DDoS the project.

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,020
And DigitalOcean didn't name names, but they said an online influencer kind of put a little

42
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,360
extra attention on this this year, one individual in particular, and they think that kind of

43
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,640
snowballed and created a lot of momentum.

44
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,560
And they were all well-intentioned, but it creates extra work for these projects.

45
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,680
And I think it's easy to accidentally generate a lot of work for these maintainers.

46
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,240
Yeah, and this is not the only instance of this that we've seen.

47
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,320
We've seen other people with reach do that very same thing.

48
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,980
They have good intentions.

49
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,340
They are a little naive about it.

50
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:06,340
And they put out there into the community that these open source projects need help

51
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,800
via pull requests or bug reports.

52
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,000
But those bug reports and pull requests have to be of good quality, otherwise, they are

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,160
worse than not having them in the first place, as we're seeing here with what's being marked

54
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,400
as spam.

55
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,040
And the projects need the personnel and staffing to actually address the problems.

56
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,860
And generally, there's already a long list of problems.

57
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,960
It's more about actually getting the work done.

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,320
But that's a complicated problem.

59
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,040
We could probably do an entire show.

60
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,800
The important takeaway from this is after kind of initial, not really understanding

61
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,880
seeming response from DigitalOcean, they now have made good.

62
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,320
And they've made this a you have to opt in to participate.

63
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,080
So you have to add their Hacktoberfest metadata to your repository to make it clear that you

64
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,120
want to participate.

65
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,720
And so instead of it being opt out, it is now opt in.

66
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,480
And so they'll probably end up with a warehouse full of t shirts then.

67
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,760
Better get back to in person events so they can do something with those shirts.

68
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,960
There's also a tool out there that GitHub has released to help you clean some of this

69
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,960
stuff up.

70
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,880
If this has been an issue for you, we'll have some resources in the show notes to help you

71
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,880
out.

72
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:16,440
But ultimately, this does show that DigitalOcean do listen to the community.

73
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,640
It took them a few days to sort this out, but it seems to be a solution that most people

74
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
are happy with now.

75
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,960
I think it's worth noting, maybe more people know how to do this now.

76
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,440
And getting more people involved and just being aware that these are open source projects

77
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,640
that you can contribute to, and this is how you submit PRs, and this is this is how you

78
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,640
interface, that has to have some value.

79
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,200
I don't know if it equals the cost of the time of these very limited time of these developers.

80
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,440
But I hope there is some long term benefit of the network effect of DigitalOcean's Hacktoberfest,

81
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,120
bringing people into the ecosystem and teaching them some of the basics.

82
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,120
And it's a good motivator.

83
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,840
Free stuff, turns out, motivates people to learn.

84
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:01,760
Yeah, and if nothing else, hopefully this has put a spotlight on the quality of pull

85
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,800
requests and just changing a few commas in a readme is not actually very useful.

86
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,920
And now people will hopefully realize that, people who are new to this community.

87
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,220
Well, Google made news this week with a brand new Chromecast that now comes with something

88
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:23,080
called Google TV, which is not Google TV as you knew it, but is now better summarized

89
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,880
as an experience that runs on a upgraded Chromecast device.

90
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,900
Yeah, this came out of the Pixel 5 online event this week.

91
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,740
Now I don't own a TV.

92
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,480
So this is all just alien to me.

93
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,920
It's very confusing.

94
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:43,080
And having read about it, it's still a little confusing to me exactly what is Google TV,

95
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,320
what's Android TV, and how it all fits together.

96
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
Yeah.

97
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,240
And as somebody who loves his Nvidia Shield, I was concerned what this meant for the future.

98
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,200
But I think I have it figured out.

99
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,840
This is maybe not a fair, fair comparison.

100
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,520
But think of Google TV as a launcher that will now sit on top of the Android TV operating

101
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
system.

102
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,800
This is a new experience that uses Android TV underneath.

103
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,320
The Google TV project as it was, the thing that was featured on the Nexus Player and

104
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,220
whatnot is no longer.

105
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,300
But they've taken some of the ideas from the UI experience and brought them forward.

106
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,840
It's now much more tightly integrated with Google Assistant and much more tightly integrated

107
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,620
with their streaming partners, Apple TV Plus aside.

108
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,520
And it puts all of that content front and center along with YouTube TV Live.

109
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,920
It's now just a tab on there.

110
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:37,320
And it's like this souped up interface that now comes shipped on a 50-ish, $60 Chromecast.

111
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,200
Alex from the self-hosted podcast already has one and he's already experimenting with

112
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
it.

113
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,240
So I think on an upcoming episode soon, we'll get his review.

114
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,960
I look forward to that.

115
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,000
But it's interesting that it doesn't support Stadia at launch.

116
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,720
That is coming soon, early next year probably.

117
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,740
What does that tell you about Stadia as a priority for Google?

118
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,440
It can't be very high for them.

119
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,840
I think what it really betrays is how they fail internally to support each other and

120
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,440
how isolated these different projects are.

121
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:13,440
I would bet you a cider that Google TV as an experience was its own siloed project completely

122
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,180
separate off and doing its own thing that has now come along and they just never interface

123
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,560
properly with the Stadia team.

124
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,320
And so they have this embarrassing missing feature that any other provider would never

125
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,040
ship a platform like this and not put their absolute latest and greatest streaming services

126
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
front and center.

127
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,280
It's laughable when you actually break it down like that.

128
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,440
But it just seems to be Google's failure to function internally and maybe why they don't

129
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,100
properly support these products at the end of the day.

130
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,700
And I'm not very thrilled so far with the early implementation.

131
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:49,800
It seems from what I've gathered from Alex and the audience that Plex, Ambi, Kodi, they

132
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,000
don't get to participate in this new Google TV UI.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,540
They're now just apps that you have to go into and their data is an island onto themselves

134
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,000
siloed off inside somewhere in the UI.

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,240
But Hulu Plus and Disney Plus of course that's all front and centered and of course YouTube

136
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,200
TV that's integrated throughout.

137
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:13,160
And so the streaming partners and the services that I really don't want to buy all of them

138
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,480
so I'm not going to use them all are now just front and center.

139
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,760
And my apps that I want to get to the actual library that I've now invested almost a decade

140
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:28,840
into well that's buried one, two, three, four, five tabs down now and inside siloed off not

141
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,140
integrated with the rest of the experience.

142
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:36,560
And I don't think it's clear today what Google has planned to address that if Plex and Ambi

143
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,880
and Kodi can update and take advantage of the UI or if they have to be a streaming partner

144
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,440
and they'll never be part of it.

145
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
It's not clear right now.

146
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,560
But there is some good news regarding Google TV and that is that the recent WireGuard update

147
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,800
supports it and is very easy to use by the sounds of things.

148
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,520
If you want to hop on your VPN to pretend that you're in a different country for Netflix

149
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,520
or whatever.

150
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:06,600
This is so cool to have something like WireGuard that is not only making the Android TV app

151
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,120
which I am super grateful for but it seems like they're also going out of their way to

152
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,000
try to make it the best experience on a stock unrooted device or on a fully rooted device.

153
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,040
They seem to make accommodations for either and give you the best experience and that's

154
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,520
awesome to see the developers going out of their way to accommodate that.

155
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,740
And having this integrated at the TV level, that's so awesome because you could take something

156
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
like the Shield with you.

157
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,160
They have like a more portable little tube version now.

158
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,200
You could take something like that with you to a hotel, plug it into the hotel television

159
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,040
when that becomes a thing again.

160
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,480
Or like you said for region hopping or for a guy like me who has a lot of stuff archived

161
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,520
at the studio, I could just VPN into the studio, get access to all the stuff stored on there

162
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,280
without having to open up any ports to the internet, keeping it all private and secure.

163
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,160
The only other thing now I need to really make life complete would be a really simple

164
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,840
way to download YouTube videos and store them on the Android TV so I could watch them offline.

165
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,800
You combine all this together and it's nearly the perfect set top box.

166
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,560
Does New Pipe not work with Android TV?

167
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
I don't know.

168
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,720
I've never tried New Pipe on the old Android TV.

169
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,080
I'll definitely give it a go.

170
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,720
I was hoping one day to find something that was a Kodi plugin because that'd be the perfect

171
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,760
thing is a Kodi YouTube browser that downloads the YouTube videos and then adds them to the

172
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,320
library for watching.

173
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,440
That just seems like utopia, but I guess just Crazy Chris wants that.

174
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,200
I'll definitely try out New Pipe though.

175
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,880
If you do, I recommend getting it from GitHub rather than F-Droid.

176
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,480
It depends who I'm recommending it to.

177
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,800
If people aren't going to manually update it, then get it from F-Droid and you'll get

178
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:45,040
notifications but someone like you who's going to be on it, I'd say get it from GitHub so

179
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,720
you can get the absolute newest version.

180
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Oh yeah.

181
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
You know that API.

182
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
It's always changing.

183
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Yep.

184
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,160
On the phone side of Android, we've had a clarification from Google this week about

185
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,200
their in-app payment policy.

186
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,320
They take a lot of this blog post to essentially boil it down to one point they make in here,

187
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:08,260
which is, quote, we want to be sure our policies are clear and up to date so they can be applied

188
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,520
consistently and fairly to all developers.

189
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,760
So we have clarified the language in our payments policy to be more explicit that all developers

190
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,760
selling digital goods in their apps are required to use Google Play's billing system.

191
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,720
In other words, if you are doing in-app purchases, they're going to get their 30% cut.

192
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,600
This essentially brings them more in line with the Apple App Store policy, but I think

193
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,920
Google trying to project an image that's a little softer than what Apple does is offering

194
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,360
an olive branch to developers in a sense, giving them a one-year grace period for developers

195
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,180
to comply with the policy.

196
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,480
This is clearly all about Epic and Fortnite, isn't it?

197
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:55,960
This is their reaction to that whole case and trying to kind of weasel out of it because

198
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:01,480
they also say, hey, look, you can have your apps on other app stores and a bunch of phones,

199
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,280
most phones in fact, ship with at least two app stores on them already and there's nothing

200
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,760
stopping you putting your app in there and you can advertise deals elsewhere, like via

201
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,540
email or whatever, but just not via the Play Store.

202
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:20,180
It's them trying to say that it's all far more open than Apple.

203
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:26,240
It's an interesting position they're taking because it will strengthen Apple's fight.

204
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,340
This is a win for Apple because Google's essentially aligning themselves with Apple's policy, which

205
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,300
I think maybe the idea there is to strengthen Apple's position in their fight with Epic

206
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,080
because Google is facing the same fight.

207
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,360
They're making this move and they're doing it in a way that's gentler than how Apple

208
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
does it.

209
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,820
I love also in this just another kind of clever strategy of theirs is they're playing into

210
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,320
fragmentation now.

211
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,600
They're using fragmentation as a benefit saying, well, look, most of our phones ship with two

212
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,400
app stores already.

213
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,360
Isn't that great?

214
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,580
Which is horrible, right?

215
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,100
It's a mess and it probably means tons of crazy spam push notifications and probably

216
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:09,460
means that unknown sources are checked by default and all kinds of junk, but they're

217
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:15,600
able to now leverage that as an advantage in this particular argument while also simultaneously

218
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,680
strengthening Apple's fight against Epic and thus their own, which is also pending.

219
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:27,000
It's funny that just this very morning, my wife said to me, what's my Jisc manager and

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,560
why does it want to update?

221
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,880
And I said, oh yeah, that's how we get root and for the ad block thing.

222
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,560
And she said, okay, so it wants me to give it permission.

223
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,140
So okay, I've done that.

224
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,140
Is that it?

225
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,320
And I said, oh no, now you have to press back and then install it.

226
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,320
She's like, what?

227
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,680
That's just horrible, horrible user experience.

228
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:52,540
And that is the complaint that the likes of Epic are throwing at Google that yes, technically

229
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:58,200
you can sideload APKs, which is essentially what we're talking about with other app stores,

230
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,620
but it's not as smooth as the Play Store.

231
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,740
You can't have silent automatic updates.

232
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,320
You're always going to get a prompt and it's always going to say things that sound a little

233
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,760
bit like you probably shouldn't be doing this and you're kind of taking risks.

234
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,640
And so I'm not really buying it that it is a level playing field for all app stores because

235
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,040
it just isn't.

236
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,000
And Google are now saying that in Android 12, which will be coming next year, they're

237
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,720
going to make it easier to install applications from third party app stores while also being

238
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
secure.

239
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
They're going to make that happen.

240
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
But that's what they're saying.

241
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,080
Well, I'm going to your point about not buying what they're selling here.

242
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,620
I kind of have that issue to surprise, surprise.

243
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,820
I feel almost like they're patronizing developers in a sense.

244
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:45,640
The post where they announced that you're going to pay your cut is titled, quote, listening

245
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,160
to developer feedback to improve Google Play, which is a bunch of news speak if I've ever

246
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,300
seen any.

247
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:56,800
But then there's this actual section that they have completely like its own paragraph

248
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,040
with its own title called equal treatment.

249
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,560
And it reads, our policies apply equally to all apps distributed on Google Play, including

250
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,280
Google's own apps.

251
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,120
Well, that's also a bunch of horse shit.

252
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,520
That's not believable at all.

253
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:17,120
They, first of all, don't have to pay in an app penalty because they are Google.

254
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,000
It's not any kind of equal playing ground.

255
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,080
They're often automatically updated and shipped through the Play Store.

256
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,720
They ship on the device to claim that Google's own apps are held to the same standards and

257
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:33,960
go and follow the same promotional guidelines and follow the same in-app purchases is just

258
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,680
obviously disingenuous on its face.

259
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,320
This whole thing feels disingenuous to me.

260
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:46,720
It feels like Google just trying to set themselves up for this legal battle against Epic.

261
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,600
They're just trying to lay the groundwork to say, hey, look, no, we're totally open

262
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,160
and we're giving developers a chance.

263
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,320
So don't sue us.

264
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Sue Apple.

265
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,960
I don't agree with you that they're aligning with Apple.

266
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,840
I think they're trying to distance themselves from Apple.

267
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,160
A lot of the language here is very much saying that we're open and stuff.

268
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,120
So I think they're just trying to throw Apple under the bus.

269
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,780
I think you're buying what they're selling.

270
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,800
Google always, always drapes it in this language.

271
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,800
But when you look at the functional result of what's actually being done here, they're

272
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,280
essentially just implementing, they're taking Apple's App Store policy and now it's just

273
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,800
the industry standard.

274
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,080
They're just implementing the same stuff.

275
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,680
Yeah, but officially they were implementing that before.

276
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,880
They were quite lax on it and it was only when there was a big play like Epic that they

277
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:36,600
went after them and kicked them out of the store.

278
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,680
But ultimately that was the policy before.

279
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,520
Now they've just tightened it up a little bit.

280
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,520
Right.

281
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,320
Although if they wanted to distance themselves, they could have come out today and said, we've

282
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,100
partnered with Stripe and now Stripe will be available as an in-app payment option to

283
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,920
Android developers and you can take, you know, you'll keep 90% of the revenue.

284
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,440
We now have new options for Android developers because Google supports open payment systems.

285
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,520
Well, yeah, but they obviously wouldn't do that because then they're going to miss out

286
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,960
on a bunch of money.

287
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,200
That 30% is a lot of money.

288
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:11,680
There's not that many developers and that many apps charging, but I think the ones that

289
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,160
are charging money are charging a lot in aggregate with all their users.

290
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,680
Well, and here's the beauty now is both Google's lawyers and Apple's lawyers can point to each

291
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,720
other and say, look, we both had terms of service.

292
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,280
Epic agreed to those terms of services.

293
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,960
Then they broke them intentionally.

294
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,040
Both of our app stores are aligned on this issue.

295
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,400
This is a standard problem and Epic knew it going in for both of them.

296
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
He's doing it.

297
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,400
We're doing it.

298
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Epic's the one in the wrong.

299
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,040
I mean, either way, this is a loss for Epic and probably a loss for end users that were

300
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,540
hoping on Epic making this crack on the iOS platform that may force sideloading or some

301
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,800
other unbelievable result.

302
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,760
I think those hopes have all pretty much been crushed by this alignment of policies.

303
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,760
I disagree.

304
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,320
Maybe I'm buying what Google's selling here, but I do see this distinction.

305
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,080
I think that they're saying, yes, that is the policy in the Play Store, but you have

306
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,760
alternatives.

307
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,320
And I think ultimately, we may see Apple being forced to allow sideloading.

308
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,880
I think it would probably not be a great thing in terms of security if they did that.

309
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,760
But I think that we could see that on the iPhone.

310
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,740
I don't think anything will change on Android because you can already sideload in theory

311
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,440
if you jump through a few hoops.

312
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:32,000
I'll say this to Google's credit if Android 12 ships and they've made good on their promise

313
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,560
to make it easier to install apps from third party stores.

314
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:41,240
And that experience is close to first class, then I'd say that's at least enabling a different

315
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,640
app store with its own rules and its own cuts to be competitive.

316
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,320
And that's absolutely better than nothing.

317
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,160
In fact, if that's actually viable, say the Amazon app store or whatever could be like

318
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,760
a serious contender on Android and really be good and be well integrated, then that

319
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,880
really is more choice and Google can do whatever it wants with the Play Store.

320
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,520
Somehow I don't think they're going to be quite equal though, are they?

321
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,160
Even after these changes in Android 12.

322
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,480
Jupiter Broadcasting has sponsor openings in October.

323
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,000
We are the largest, longest running Linux podcast in the world, and now we're independent

324
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
again.

325
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,320
We have an opportunity for the right sponsor to reach the perfect audience.

326
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,440
They're technical, they're informed, and they want to get things done.

327
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,920
And more than ever, there's an opportunity to invest in a proven performer and get your

328
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,580
product or service featured in our shows.

329
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:32,840
From the community to the community, it's a pretty great opportunity to support the

330
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,440
content we love and get your business and services featured.

331
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,320
Let's make this next evolution of Jupiter Broadcasting even better together.

332
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,320
Let's grow together.

333
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,860
Email me, chris at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

335
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,240
As predicted and to no one's surprise, Google's search preference menu has eliminated Duck

336
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,040
Duck Go in its latest round.

337
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,600
Yeah, this is Google's browser ballot, which was their response to the European Commission

338
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,120
ruling that they had a monopoly on search in Android.

339
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,420
So if you get a new Android device in Europe, you're going to be faced with this selection

340
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,420
menu.

341
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:16,040
I remember at the time when this was first announced, we talked about it and it didn't

342
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,680
seem quite right.

343
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,240
There's a sealed bidding process where search engines say how much they're willing to pay

344
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,120
per user who selects them.

345
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,080
And it's Google making money from something that maybe they oughtn't to be making money

346
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,080
from.

347
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,360
I had all their excuses at the time, but it never quite sat well with me.

348
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,840
Surprise, surprise.

349
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,600
The way things have shaked out is Duck Duck Go didn't win.

350
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,300
And it seems that it encourages the companies that do win to up their ad spends to then

351
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,880
make the money to place bids to win this.

352
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,800
And Duck Duck Go isn't really holding anything back.

353
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,140
And on their website, they write, our most recent large sample user testing shows that

354
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:01,020
when a search preference menu is displayed and designed properly, then Google's search

355
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,960
mobile market could drop immediately by 20%.

356
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,080
So they think Google's intentionally not designing this thing right.

357
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,720
And they say Duck Duck Go, despite being the go to Google alternative that consumers most

358
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,080
want to select, will no longer even appear in most countries.

359
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,520
As a result, many EU residents buying a new Android device will no longer have an easy

360
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,680
way to adopt a private search engine.

361
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:31,120
The central problem with Google's search preference menu is that it is pay to play.

362
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,280
And only the highest bidders are on the menu.

363
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,560
And they say that the long term problem here is it incentivizes bad behavior.

364
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,060
It incentivizes these search engines to do things to up ad revenue that essentially make

365
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,760
them less private for consumers.

366
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,240
Yeah, and I do have a lot of sympathy for them.

367
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,320
But what can they do?

368
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,640
They're calling on the European Commission to say, look, you haven't complied properly,

369
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,040
which I'm inclined to agree with.

370
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,800
But Google has a lot of lawyers, and they pay them a lot of money.

371
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,320
And somehow, I can't see anything changing here.

372
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,000
They did just enough to comply.

373
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,200
And the European Commission are not known for their speed when it comes to bureaucracy.

374
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,360
So even if Duck Duck Go does manage to get them to change anything, it's going to take

375
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,960
a long time for it to happen.

376
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,440
And in the meantime, Duck Duck Go is just out in the cold, essentially.

377
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,760
And at the end of the day, has Google done anything wrong?

378
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,760
Perhaps Duck Duck Go just didn't bid enough.

379
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,120
And so someone was willing to spend more.

380
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,400
Now Duck Duck Go says that's bad for the ecosystem.

381
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,460
But I think Google could argue that it's fair play because this is first class placement

382
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,460
on their operating system.

383
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,840
You know, it would have been a lot easier if the world's largest search engine and ad

384
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,520
agency didn't make the world's largest operating system.

385
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,120
Things might have been a little bit simpler.

386
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,760
Well, you said it would never happen, Joe, and I'm getting my Atari VCS, I think, soon,

387
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
maybe.

388
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,400
Soon TM, yeah.

389
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:13,080
So on the Medium blog for the Atari VCS, they posted some pictures of the Atari VCS being

390
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,080
made and in all the boxes getting ready to ship.

391
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,080
But people are very skeptical about this.

392
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:28,920
And they are the most cliche fundraiser, we're shipping photos.

393
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,840
You never seen more pictures of boxes.

394
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,840
I looked into my Indiegogo records.

395
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,960
It looks like I bought mine on June 3rd, 2018, which I thought it was sooner than that.

396
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:45,080
But that's according to Indiegogo and my updated delivery date for my Atari VCS collector's

397
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,280
edition is currently October 2020.

398
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,480
Hang on.

399
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
That's now.

400
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
It's October 2020.

401
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,760
Yeah, yeah.

402
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,920
So that's recently been updated at Indiegogo.

403
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,280
It didn't say that like three months ago when I logged in and checked it.

404
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,320
We should say what this is for people who don't remember it from all those years ago.

405
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Right, right.

406
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:13,080
This is a severely outdated game console that will have a custom Atari UI on top of it that

407
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,400
will offer services that I'll likely not want to participate in.

408
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,640
This is I mean, the idea is neat, right?

409
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,540
It's a retro wood looking Atari type console that will have a retro inspired UI that brings

410
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:31,760
together independent games and commercial games and has a somewhat compelling AMD platform

411
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
that runs Ubuntu all under the hood.

412
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,820
I mean, talk about checking all my boxes back in 2018.

413
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:46,440
But now in 2020, when the PlayStation 5 has been announced and I have a Switch and I have

414
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,360
an Nvidia Shield, I'm not really in a place where I even want this product anymore.

415
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,180
I'm going to give it a full go and a review with an open mind because I got to be honest,

416
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,800
if I could have a Linux box that looks like an awesome Atari console that can run Kodi

417
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,140
and Plex and MB, I actually would probably consider taking out my Shield for that.

418
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:09,720
So it may be a product I end up using, but it's not what I'm actively looking for right

419
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
now.

420
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Yeah, but it's going to be x86 based.

421
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,560
So it's going to use quite a lot of power, probably get quite hot.

422
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,960
It's the kind of thing you could do with a Raspberry Pi quite easily.

423
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,760
I don't think it's going to be able to do any modern games at all.

424
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:29,600
You're going to be looking at maybe like 10 year plus old games and emulators and stuff,

425
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,780
which the emulator side of things like your Nintendo and Sega and stuff.

426
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,320
You can do all that on a Raspberry Pi easily for what?

427
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,440
Like even a Raspberry Pi 3 would probably do that, no problem.

428
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,880
So this just seems too expensive for what you're actually going to get.

429
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:52,040
They have massively overpromised and well, they haven't even under delivered yet, have

430
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,040
they?

431
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:58,360
They haven't delivered anything and we'll, I'll believe it when it happens, but somehow

432
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:03,240
I don't think you're going to be talking about it on Linux Unplugged or this show actually

433
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,800
having used it before Christmas, but you know, I could be wrong.

434
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,600
I mean, maybe I'll have it this month.

435
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Wouldn't that be something?

436
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:16,480
If I come on the show sometime in October and I have it, I guess we'll find out.

437
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
I agree.

438
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:22,440
I think, I think the Raspberry Pi probably is pretty locked in for my use in Lady Joops

439
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,160
because of its low power status, but there's room for it here.

440
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,240
We shall see.

441
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,760
There's room for me to love it, Joe, but it's not really the product I'm looking for today.

442
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,760
But you know, in terms of game compatibility, none of that will matter because it'll probably

443
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,720
get Stadia support before the new Chromecast does.

444
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
Probably, yeah.

445
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,280
Well, we'll keep an eye on it and of course, let you know, just go to linuxactionnews.com

They have a new show with Joe, 2.5admins.com.

451
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,160
Yeah, guess who the half admin is.

452
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,920
