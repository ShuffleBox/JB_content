Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:15.780 --> 00:20.080
This is episode 25, recorded on October 29th, 2017.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.080
I'm Chris.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
And I'm Joe.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.080
Hello, Joe.

00:23.080 --> 00:26.360
I hope you're ready to get applications installed on your long-term support systems because

00:26.360 --> 00:29.080
Mint is adding Flatpak support.

00:29.080 --> 00:37.080
Yeah, so Mint, which is a distro based on Ubuntu, is adding Flatpak and doesn't really

00:37.080 --> 00:41.140
want to use Snap, which is a bit strange to me.

00:41.140 --> 00:42.680
Why would you when you're based on Ubuntu?

00:42.680 --> 00:43.680
That sounds complicated.

00:43.680 --> 00:52.400
Yeah, because I installed Linux Mint, the latest one, which is 18.2, I think, and it

00:52.400 --> 00:55.400
didn't have SnapD by default.

00:55.400 --> 01:01.840
It's in the repos, of course, and I pulled it down and then I got, I think, Krita working

01:01.840 --> 01:08.000
as a Snap, no problem, but it's just a bit strange that they are ignoring Snap in favor

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
of Flatpak.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.760
You know, I was wondering what that's about.

01:10.760 --> 01:15.600
And so I was reading their announcement on, this is all part of Linux Mint 18.3.

01:15.600 --> 01:20.120
It's going to come with full support for Flatpak out of the box, including integration into

01:20.120 --> 01:22.220
the Linux Mint software manager.

01:22.220 --> 01:27.600
And here's what the project wrote, Flatpak is very promising to us in its implementation.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.440
It's already very stable as far as they're concerned.

01:30.440 --> 01:35.960
And one of the key advantages to Flatpak is that it doesn't have a, quote, middleman.

01:35.960 --> 01:40.440
It's trivial for upstream software editors to distribute their software to Linux users

01:40.440 --> 01:44.980
without having to care about a multitude of distributions or a middleman.

01:44.980 --> 01:50.160
And it's easy for distributions like Mint to add their own repositories for future software

01:50.160 --> 01:51.160
ideas.

01:51.160 --> 01:54.640
In this case, it's a little bit harder with Snap, but you can do that, can't you?

01:54.640 --> 01:55.640
Absolutely.

01:55.640 --> 01:56.640
Yeah, you can absolutely.

01:56.640 --> 01:59.800
You could come up with your own distribution for Snaps, absolutely.

01:59.800 --> 02:03.960
Especially when you consider that Linux Mint develops their own software center.

02:03.960 --> 02:08.600
So it would just be a simple HTTP Git, pull down the Snap and have the software manager

02:08.600 --> 02:09.600
install it.

02:09.600 --> 02:10.600
It would absolutely be possible.

02:10.600 --> 02:15.000
I think this is maybe in part a political statement, but I think there is some merit

02:15.000 --> 02:20.520
to going with Flatpak for Mint because it is solving a problem that is almost perfect

02:20.520 --> 02:21.520
for Mint.

02:21.520 --> 02:27.160
And it's that we want the PPA type approach, but we want to deliver current software on

02:27.160 --> 02:31.200
top of a really old, potentially five-year-old base.

02:31.200 --> 02:35.000
And it's not that Snaps aren't great for that, but if you're not running the central Snap

02:35.000 --> 02:39.880
store, if you're not managing it, you want to create repos to deliver, say, Firefox for

02:39.880 --> 02:43.920
the next five years, with Flatpaks, you can do that.

02:43.920 --> 02:48.760
And you can still contain all the GTK dependencies and any of the extra stuff that your base

02:48.760 --> 02:51.600
LTS doesn't necessarily have the right version of.

02:51.600 --> 02:59.480
Yeah, but it kind of feels at this point to me like they're backing Betamax rather than

02:59.480 --> 03:00.480
VHS.

03:00.480 --> 03:05.200
I agree that momentum around Flatpak seems to have slowed down a bit and momentum around

03:05.200 --> 03:07.200
Snaps has increased.

03:07.200 --> 03:12.040
But as long as it's possible to install Snap support on Mint, as an end user, I can still

03:12.040 --> 03:15.200
take advantage of whichever one has the most momentum with the most apps.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.680
And if maybe it's both of them, then you're better off.

03:17.680 --> 03:23.720
And what we might end up with is some distributions by default will prefer Snaps, and some distributions

03:23.720 --> 03:26.280
by default will support Flatpak.

03:26.280 --> 03:30.440
What is a bit different in the implementations right now is, say, Ubuntu, for example.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.320
That would be the obvious example.

03:32.320 --> 03:35.240
It comes out of the box with Snap support.

03:35.240 --> 03:37.360
But that is not in detriment to Flatpak support.

03:37.360 --> 03:40.200
It has full first-class support for Flatpak as well.

03:40.200 --> 03:44.280
And that seems to be the better approach, just support them both and let the market

03:44.280 --> 03:45.280
decide.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.280
But maybe I'm crazy, Joe.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.680
Yeah, that does make sense.

03:47.680 --> 03:52.480
I don't know why Mint doesn't have SnapD installed by default.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.280
It's not a huge amount of room on the disk to have it.

03:56.280 --> 04:00.400
And why not just have it there as a command line-only option for power users, for want

04:00.400 --> 04:01.400
of a better word.

04:01.400 --> 04:07.880
I suppose it's not hard to apt-get install it, but for my money, yeah, just have both.

04:07.880 --> 04:12.480
Have Flatpak and Snap, integrate them both into the software center, and then give people

04:12.480 --> 04:13.480
the choice.

04:13.480 --> 04:14.720
But I suppose that is more work.

04:14.720 --> 04:20.040
And it's probably a lot less work to just pick one and take your gamble, but I just

04:20.040 --> 04:22.440
think they've gambled on the wrong thing here.

04:22.440 --> 04:26.080
If I were to speculate, I would say that's exactly what it is.

04:26.080 --> 04:30.120
They are focusing, which has been a criticism of mine in the past.

04:30.120 --> 04:34.360
The Mint project has taken on a lot of extra projects.

04:34.360 --> 04:38.560
You have the Debian edition, you have the KDE edition, you have the Xapps, you have

04:38.560 --> 04:42.000
their main desktop, you have Cinnamon.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.980
There's a lot there for them to work on.

04:43.980 --> 04:48.920
And what we might be seeing here is Clem or the project saying, we're going to narrow

04:48.920 --> 04:49.920
our focus.

04:49.920 --> 04:53.800
And we're going to say we support this really well, and that'll be our main focus.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.800
So this is what we're going to put our weight behind.

04:55.800 --> 04:59.280
And that might be why we see them discontinuing their KDE edition as well.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.280
Yeah.

05:00.280 --> 05:06.080
So in this same newsletter, they also announced that they're dropping KDE as an addition,

05:06.080 --> 05:07.200
which kind of makes sense to me.

05:07.200 --> 05:13.200
Because if you want KDE or Plasma on top of Ubuntu, you've already got two pretty solid

05:13.200 --> 05:15.800
choices in Kubuntu or KDE Neon.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.560
Do you really need a third one with Mint?

05:18.560 --> 05:19.560
Absolutely.

05:19.560 --> 05:20.560
And they're doing this the right way.

05:20.560 --> 05:23.240
They're going to continue one more release cycle.

05:23.240 --> 05:28.240
So 18.3 will ship with a KDE spin, but there won't be any after that.

05:28.240 --> 05:33.320
So there is a window of time for existing users to make a migration.

05:33.320 --> 05:38.280
And really, at least unless something dramatically changes, you could still use the Kubuntu PPAs

05:38.280 --> 05:41.880
on your Mint system and install KDE Plasma desktop that way.

05:41.880 --> 05:44.040
But at that point, what's the point?

05:44.040 --> 05:46.280
Why not just use Kubuntu?

05:46.280 --> 05:47.280
Just don't know really.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.280
Yeah, I agree.

05:48.280 --> 05:53.980
I think the Plasma desktop distro landscape, if you will, has changed with really Neon.

05:53.980 --> 05:59.120
When KDE Neon came out, I think it's changed the competitive landscape for Plasma desktops.

05:59.120 --> 06:03.640
And I applaud Mint doing this because I think focusing is the right move for them.

06:03.640 --> 06:07.320
They can maintain less focus on what they do right.

06:07.320 --> 06:11.680
And people have other options that are solid, including existing Mint users.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.540
And the fact that they're going to do one more release, that's just the icing on top

06:14.540 --> 06:15.540
of all of this.

06:15.540 --> 06:16.880
So I think this is a great move.

06:16.880 --> 06:17.880
Yeah.

06:17.880 --> 06:21.740
I think that the Mate edition should probably be next, given you've got Ubuntu Mate now

06:21.740 --> 06:26.040
that didn't exist when Linux Mint Mate edition came along.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.920
But I think it's probably quite popular still.

06:28.920 --> 06:34.400
But I think they should just focus on Cinnamon and just be the Cinnamon distro.

06:34.400 --> 06:38.480
But it's up to them, I suppose, if they want to spread themselves a little bit thinner

06:38.480 --> 06:39.480
than that.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.560
But for me, you've got to add value.

06:42.560 --> 06:47.200
If you're going to be an Ubuntu derivative, you've got to add some value there.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.840
And how do you do that?

06:48.840 --> 06:50.440
By focusing, in my opinion.

06:50.440 --> 06:54.480
And Cinnamon is its own thing that isn't widely used elsewhere.

06:54.480 --> 06:59.360
It's kind of available on some other distros, but it's not kind of the flagship of any others.

06:59.360 --> 07:04.200
So just concentrate on that, make it as good as it can possibly be, and don't waste time

07:04.200 --> 07:07.000
duplicating effort like a KDE edition.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Pretty much.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.840
We just did a new release of Cinnamon.

07:09.840 --> 07:14.040
I'm going to try to give that a look in this week's Linux Unplugged and kick the tires

07:14.040 --> 07:15.040
and report back.

07:15.040 --> 07:19.440
And you know, with all this extra time and focus, Joe, maybe they can focus on adding

07:19.440 --> 07:20.920
ZFS support to Linux.

07:20.920 --> 07:29.540
Because if one Oracle employee has his way, real Oracle-developed ZFS may become a first

07:29.540 --> 07:32.240
class upstream Linux file system.

07:32.240 --> 07:37.400
Yeah, now, I was almost reluctant to put this in the show, because to me, this feels like

07:37.400 --> 07:38.400
a non-story.

07:38.400 --> 07:47.140
But at the Open ZFS Developer Summit 2017, Mark Maybe implied that Oracle are thinking

07:47.140 --> 07:51.880
about changing the license, or at least it would be possible for them to change the license,

07:51.880 --> 07:56.540
let's say, to make it compatible with the GPL.

07:56.540 --> 07:59.640
Because at the moment, it's not.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.480
According to some people, according to Ubuntu, it is.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.880
It's all a bit of a complicated situation.

08:03.880 --> 08:08.720
If Oracle changed the license to something that is compatible with GPLv2, then we could

08:08.720 --> 08:13.120
have proper upstream support for ZFS.

08:13.120 --> 08:17.920
And this has caused a lot of people to get excited about it, but I just cannot see this

08:17.920 --> 08:18.920
happening.

08:18.920 --> 08:22.040
Yeah, he couches it a bit more as his presentation goes on.

08:22.040 --> 08:26.300
But he did say one thing that made me pause and go, hmm, okay, maybe there's some real

08:26.300 --> 08:27.720
fire to the smoke.

08:27.720 --> 08:35.840
He said that this is in light of recent reduced investment in Solaris, quote.

08:35.840 --> 08:40.120
And as they have reduced investment in Solaris and focused more on cloud, which legitimately

08:40.120 --> 08:45.840
that is something Oracle has done a lot this year, ZFS on Linux has come up more and more

08:45.840 --> 08:48.120
internally in conversations.

08:48.120 --> 08:54.680
And Mark Maybe has been an employee of Oracle since 1998, so he isn't like a spokesperson

08:54.680 --> 08:58.440
for the company, but he's probably pretty well acquainted with some of the conversations

08:58.440 --> 08:59.440
there.

08:59.440 --> 09:04.160
And he brought up ZFS or ZFS, as we say here in the States, on Linux a few more times during

09:04.160 --> 09:05.160
his talk.

09:05.160 --> 09:09.400
And in fact, he maybe even talked about it more than he talked about Solaris, really,

09:09.400 --> 09:10.400
which is kind of funny.

09:10.400 --> 09:15.100
And he said, next, what may not happen in the past, well, that could still happen with

09:15.100 --> 09:16.160
an Oracle.

09:16.160 --> 09:22.040
And he said, he personally, as a ZFS developer at Oracle, wants to see ZFS become a core

09:22.040 --> 09:23.720
part of Linux.

09:23.720 --> 09:26.640
He wants it to become the file system of Linux.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.380
And he said that could happen for, quote unquote, core Linux.

09:29.380 --> 09:30.920
It's a possibility, he says.

09:30.920 --> 09:33.120
Well, he might also want world peace.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.520
And that might also be a possibility, but he's still dreaming if he thinks it's going

09:36.520 --> 09:37.520
to happen.

09:37.520 --> 09:40.880
In the meantime, open ZFS seems to work pretty damn great on Linux.

09:40.880 --> 09:46.880
I get emails from listeners all the time that have massive storage setups on Linux using

09:46.880 --> 09:47.880
open ZFS.

09:47.880 --> 09:53.000
Yeah, and is soon going to be available on Windows, by the looks of things, which isn't

09:53.000 --> 09:54.280
massively interesting.

09:54.280 --> 09:59.880
But it just shows that the development is there, the interest is there, and the proof

09:59.880 --> 10:02.120
of concept is available on GitHub.

10:02.120 --> 10:06.460
Yeah, this is from an open ZFS contributor at that same conference we just mentioned.

10:06.460 --> 10:11.760
And Brian Contrell, who has been a repeat and favorite guest of the BSD Now show, tweeted

10:11.760 --> 10:13.560
out a picture of it happening.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.560
It's early support.

10:14.560 --> 10:19.640
Like, right now, it's currently missing the ZFS volume support and the ability to compile

10:19.640 --> 10:21.560
ZFS on top of ZFS.

10:21.560 --> 10:24.440
But other than a few remaining bugs, it's pretty damn close.

10:24.440 --> 10:29.240
And we're going to be in a reality where you can hook up a ZFS array to a Windows box and

10:29.240 --> 10:30.600
read the data very soon.

10:30.600 --> 10:35.240
Yeah, and that's going to help adoption, even if it's just a tiny bit.

10:35.240 --> 10:38.720
The more platforms it's available on, the more adoption you're going to have.

10:38.720 --> 10:42.620
Speaking of Microsoft, this reminded me of Microsoft from the good old days.

10:42.620 --> 10:48.600
Google Play Protect is dead last at fingering malware on a survey that was conducted on

10:48.600 --> 10:49.600
Android.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.440
Google Play Protect, which is Google's...

10:52.440 --> 10:53.440
Windows defender?

10:53.440 --> 10:54.440
Well, kind of.

10:54.440 --> 10:59.720
But it uses machine learning to constantly scan your device and scan everyone's devices

10:59.720 --> 11:01.840
to see if any apps are behaving badly.

11:01.840 --> 11:02.840
Oh, really?

11:02.840 --> 11:03.840
Machine learning.

11:03.840 --> 11:05.880
So it must be really accurate then, Joe.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.640
Yeah, except not.

11:07.640 --> 11:15.960
Because as you said, they came dead last of 20 antivirus systems that AV Test tested,

11:15.960 --> 11:17.800
which is just not good at all, is it?

11:17.800 --> 11:22.360
No, I can't even believe we're talking about AV on Android.

11:22.360 --> 11:23.420
And I guess this is a thing.

11:23.420 --> 11:26.540
This is an article we'll have linked in the show notes so you can read more if you care.

11:26.540 --> 11:33.320
But six of the 20 software suites sampled correctly flagged every single one as a threat.

11:33.320 --> 11:37.540
So they did pretty good, but only six of 20 managed that far.

11:37.540 --> 11:39.160
Eight more managed 99%.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.160
That's pretty solid.

11:40.160 --> 11:44.800
But Google's own system, Play Protect, which Google bills as the only solution you need

11:44.800 --> 11:50.960
to protect Android, it only detected 65.8% of threats.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.800
This really reminds me of Windows Defender and the Microsoft days when they got into

11:54.800 --> 11:55.800
antivirus.

11:55.800 --> 11:56.800
It's Windows all over again.

11:56.800 --> 12:00.520
Yeah, I remember when I first got into Linux, thinking, wow, this is great, I don't need

12:00.520 --> 12:03.400
to use antivirus anymore.

12:03.400 --> 12:09.020
And I heard the argument at the time that, well, if Linux was as popular as Windows,

12:09.020 --> 12:13.360
in terms of desktop market share, then people would be making malware for it and people

12:13.360 --> 12:14.560
would be exploiting it.

12:14.560 --> 12:18.880
Now I question that to some extent because of the way that Linux is built.

12:18.880 --> 12:23.560
I think it's a better designed system.

12:23.560 --> 12:27.020
But there was never really a test of that because it wasn't widespread.

12:27.020 --> 12:29.800
Now I know that Android is not desktop Linux.

12:29.800 --> 12:30.800
It's got a Linux kernel.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.880
It's a very different system.

12:32.880 --> 12:37.400
But here we have mass adoption of Linux in consumer devices.

12:37.400 --> 12:42.760
And now we're starting to see malware for it, which kind of goes to show that if you've

12:42.760 --> 12:47.760
got enough market share, people will at least attempt to find vulnerabilities.

12:47.760 --> 12:48.760
I suppose.

12:48.760 --> 12:52.720
I think it's a more enticing market because you have a couple of fundamentals about the

12:52.720 --> 12:57.640
majority of the market, probably not the majority of our audience, but the majority of the market.

12:57.640 --> 13:01.600
They're likely running devices that have built in vulnerabilities at this point that just

13:01.600 --> 13:03.760
haven't been patched for a long time.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.620
And they have an always on data connection.

13:06.620 --> 13:10.820
And that is monetizable by malware in a really special way.

13:10.820 --> 13:15.720
Because even just loading ads is so profitable over a large majority of phones.

13:15.720 --> 13:21.560
If you get 100,000, 200,000 phones and you get redirecting ads, and it's only a few pennies,

13:21.560 --> 13:23.240
but it really adds up.

13:23.240 --> 13:25.640
And there's no firewall.

13:25.640 --> 13:26.800
There's no network filter.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.560
There's no network administrator.

13:28.560 --> 13:32.880
There's really no kind of protection that you have in place for a lot of desktop PCs.

13:32.880 --> 13:39.360
I would argue that a desktop PC behind a basic Linksys router is better protected than your

13:39.360 --> 13:41.800
average smartphone that's just raw dog on the cellular network.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.680
Yeah, I hadn't really thought about that.

13:43.680 --> 13:48.280
I suppose a lot of people use Wi-Fi a lot of the time, and therefore they are behind

13:48.280 --> 13:49.280
a NATed router.

13:49.280 --> 13:52.920
But that's even worse because you're hopping around unknown networks constantly.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.240
You never know who's monitoring.

13:54.240 --> 13:57.920
These are a specific kind of threat vector because they're devices that are unpatched.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.640
You're all over on networks.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.580
You're directly connected to the cellular network, and then the next day you're over

14:02.580 --> 14:05.440
on the Starbucks network with 15 other scoundrels.

14:05.440 --> 14:11.000
But there's just so many more attack vectors on Android than there are on desktop Linux.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
So what's the solution then?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Install antivirus?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.320
Isn't that a horrible thing?

14:15.320 --> 14:19.160
I hate to make this an iOS or Android conversation, but this doesn't seem to be an issue on the

14:19.160 --> 14:20.160
iOS side.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.280
So perhaps it could just be taken care of at the Play Store level.

14:23.280 --> 14:28.320
Realistically, if you turn off sideloading and you just install apps from the Play Store,

14:28.320 --> 14:30.740
most of the time you're going to be safe.

14:30.740 --> 14:35.660
Because countries where they don't have play services or they can't get a play account

14:35.660 --> 14:39.520
for some reason, where they turn on sideloading, it's a problem.

14:39.520 --> 14:43.960
Because geeks who turn on sideloading probably are not the target here.

14:43.960 --> 14:47.880
If you intentionally enable sideloading, you probably know what you're doing.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.200
Probably, I suppose.

14:50.200 --> 14:56.960
But I'm setting up a phone with lineage for someone, and I want to put Addaway on there,

14:56.960 --> 15:00.720
which means I have to enable sideloading.

15:00.720 --> 15:03.760
But it makes me, I don't know, should I do that?

15:03.760 --> 15:07.600
You can even more control in later versions of Android with sideloading.

15:07.600 --> 15:11.840
But I will admit here on the program that I turned on sideloading so I could install

15:11.840 --> 15:14.120
a tricorder app, and I've left it turned on.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.840
But it is the coolest tricorder app ever.

15:15.840 --> 15:22.840
So in my defense, you're such a Star Trek nerd.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.960
blast.ting.com Ting is a smarter way to do mobile.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.880
It's just what you use is what you pay.

15:28.880 --> 15:29.880
And that's it.

15:29.880 --> 15:30.880
No contract.

15:30.880 --> 15:31.880
No agreements.

15:31.880 --> 15:35.800
They have CDMA and GSM networks, so you can pick whatever works better in your region

15:35.800 --> 15:40.160
or if you have a device that supports one of those networks, which is probably all of

15:40.160 --> 15:42.360
them, just check their BYOD page.

15:42.360 --> 15:43.360
You can bring it over to Ting.

15:43.360 --> 15:47.520
And if you go to blast.ting.com, you'll get a $25 service credit.

15:47.520 --> 15:51.080
And your average Ting bill is just $23 per phone.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.920
That paid for more than my first month.

15:52.920 --> 15:57.400
blast.ting.com nationwide coverage, pay for what you use, a great dashboard with no contracts.

15:57.400 --> 16:00.560
They have a bunch of great devices you can buy directly.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.000
You hear Joe and I often talk about Lineage or Sailfish.

16:04.000 --> 16:08.920
One of the things I absolutely love about Ting is they have no strategy tax.

16:08.920 --> 16:12.160
You can load whichever OS just functions properly on the network.

16:12.160 --> 16:15.440
They don't have an experience that they want you to have installed on your phone.

16:15.440 --> 16:23.400
They just get out of the way and let you use your phone, blast.ting.com Okay, let's talk

16:23.400 --> 16:29.300
about Tor and their fundraising campaign, Powering Digital Resistance.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.360
Just a quick plug for them, really.

16:30.360 --> 16:34.360
They're looking for donations and Mozilla is going to match any donations that the public

16:34.360 --> 16:40.400
make up to a total of half a million dollars, which is not insignificant.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.320
That means if they get 500,000 from people donating, they'll end up with a million.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.360
Yeah, that means your donation goes twice as far.

16:46.360 --> 16:47.360
So I did it.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.880
I donated and I declined any of the benefits.

16:49.880 --> 16:53.920
They had like stickers and the level I was donating at, you got a shirt, which I honestly

16:53.920 --> 16:54.920
wouldn't mind.

16:54.920 --> 16:58.760
But I felt like, you know what, keep the money, save even, save, make even more profit off

16:58.760 --> 16:59.760
of my donation.

16:59.760 --> 17:00.760
Yeah.

17:00.760 --> 17:05.960
Tor is not something I use because it's just inconvenient because of all the captures for

17:05.960 --> 17:08.540
every bloody website that you go to.

17:08.540 --> 17:11.640
Anything that's got cloud is just a nightmare.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.720
But I can see that it's very important for some people.

17:14.720 --> 17:15.720
Absolutely the same for me.

17:15.720 --> 17:19.800
I'm not even sure if I've used Tor this year, but I felt like it's a great resource if I

17:19.800 --> 17:20.800
ever do need it.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.000
And it is a great resource for others.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
And while Mozilla is doubling it, why not?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Why not do it?

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
So I tossed in.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Yeah.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
It's not like Mozilla can't afford it.

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
All right.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.520
Well, that was a quick mention.

17:31.520 --> 17:33.520
Another quick mention for Solus.

17:33.520 --> 17:40.400
iKey put up a post on Google Plus asking for people to contribute artwork to Solus 4, which

17:40.400 --> 17:46.140
is coming, I think before the end of the year, but anyway, coming relatively soon.

17:46.140 --> 17:50.680
And he's basically admitting that he's terrible at art, and that's why there's no install

17:50.680 --> 17:52.320
a slideshow, that sort of thing.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.960
So they're looking for volunteers for this.

17:54.960 --> 17:59.520
And the way I see it is that Solus have done so much great work for the Linux community,

17:59.520 --> 18:02.640
specifically with the Steam stuff.

18:02.640 --> 18:06.460
It just seems fair enough for them to ask for a bit back from the community.

18:06.460 --> 18:10.360
So if you're good at art and want to help them out, it would be great, even if you don't

18:10.360 --> 18:13.200
use Solus, even if it's just to help out the Linux community.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.520
Yeah, and I would say that the Steam stuff is even the least of it.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.640
There is more stuff than people are aware of.

18:18.640 --> 18:23.880
And eventually, I hope the entire Linux community will see the clear Linux bootloader way, and

18:23.880 --> 18:25.520
we'll get new bootloaders for all.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.040
In the meantime, also help them out with a logo.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.480
They should add that to their list.

18:29.480 --> 18:33.240
Well, you don't really care for the Solus logo, then.

18:33.240 --> 18:36.160
It doesn't make me think of Solus at all.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.880
It makes me think actually of software development.

18:37.880 --> 18:41.040
When I see that, it looks like a software development company logo.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.040
That's all.

18:42.040 --> 18:45.160
I don't think of the Linux desktop at all, or the great desktop that it makes.

18:45.160 --> 18:48.120
But maybe that's because I'm just lost in VR, Joe.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.160
Yeah, maybe.

18:50.160 --> 18:55.200
So this is a bit of a depressing thing, isn't it, that Steam VR market share is already bigger

18:55.200 --> 18:59.400
than Steam Linux market share.

18:59.400 --> 19:01.080
That doesn't look good, does it?

19:01.080 --> 19:02.960
I suppose it doesn't look good, no.

19:02.960 --> 19:07.480
This is a hard thing to measure precisely because overall Steam market share is always

19:07.480 --> 19:08.480
increasing.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.180
So it doesn't necessarily correlate to less Linux.

19:11.180 --> 19:14.840
It just means it's just a smaller percentage of the overall share.

19:14.840 --> 19:20.480
The reality is that VR games are those sort of adopter-driven type games.

19:20.480 --> 19:23.240
You're going to buy the hardware, you're going to load Windows, because that's where the

19:23.240 --> 19:26.700
best VR games are at, and if you're going to invest hundreds and hundreds and hundreds

19:26.700 --> 19:29.840
of dollars into this, you're not going to stop at the OS.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.320
So that doesn't surprise me.

19:31.320 --> 19:34.160
I would be surprised if in a year or so things didn't shake out, though.

19:34.160 --> 19:40.280
What, you think that there'll be more people using Linux or fewer people using VR?

19:40.280 --> 19:41.800
Well, both, actually.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.960
You'll have more people using Linux, you'll have more VR games on Linux, and you're going

19:44.960 --> 19:48.520
to have more adoption of Vulkan, which is going to enable the more VR games.

19:48.520 --> 19:51.240
And I think as that shifts, you'll see this even out a bit.

19:51.240 --> 19:56.320
It's always going to be predominant on Windows for now, but I would suspect that eventually

19:56.320 --> 20:00.340
there's going to be some other VR platform that's going to kick Windows off the charts

20:00.340 --> 20:01.480
that comes out.

20:01.480 --> 20:03.600
And we won't even be having this conversation anymore.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.600
I don't know, man.

20:04.600 --> 20:08.880
PC gaming and Windows are just so closely tied together.

20:08.880 --> 20:14.480
Unless you've got a completely independent VR headset that doesn't need a Windows PC

20:14.480 --> 20:18.320
or some sort of PC to plug into, but that feels so far away.

20:18.320 --> 20:19.760
Yeah, but I think it'll happen.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.080
That's exactly what I think.

20:21.080 --> 20:22.480
You might be right.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.520
I was just thinking recently, I don't need Linux to have all the games.

20:25.520 --> 20:29.320
I just need to have a few games that I want to play, and it's pretty much there now.

20:29.320 --> 20:32.380
And I think that's going to become more and more commonplace.

20:32.380 --> 20:33.380
We'll see.

20:33.380 --> 20:34.380
Time will tell.

20:34.380 --> 20:40.120
Speaking of looking ahead, 2018 is going to be a year of regulation for cryptocurrencies,

20:40.120 --> 20:41.120
in Russia at least.

20:41.120 --> 20:45.320
Yeah, there's been new orders from on high in the Russian government to determine how

20:45.320 --> 20:51.080
cryptocurrencies, all of them, but obviously Bitcoin, fit into the broader Russian financial

20:51.080 --> 20:54.320
regulatory framework by next July.

20:54.320 --> 20:59.740
The orders also are going to require legislators to set up a framework for registering miners,

20:59.740 --> 21:03.700
the people that are running the blockchains and the backbones of the currency network,

21:03.700 --> 21:07.560
so that the Russian government can effectively tax them.

21:07.560 --> 21:13.160
Now the whole idea here is to set up a regulatory platform known as a sandbox.

21:13.160 --> 21:17.440
Look at them using these modern terms, where blockchain developers can basically demonstrate

21:17.440 --> 21:22.440
new technologies or new applications to the Bank of Russia, so that they can then be regulated

21:22.440 --> 21:25.680
appropriately and legal before the end of the year.

21:25.680 --> 21:30.560
I get the feeling all this regulation that we're starting to see now in China, in Russia,

21:30.560 --> 21:36.680
even in Europe, and even in the States, is just going to have the complete opposite effect

21:36.680 --> 21:37.880
to what they want.

21:37.880 --> 21:44.920
This is the old financial systems trying to regulate this new thing, and you cannot do

21:44.920 --> 21:45.920
that.

21:45.920 --> 21:51.660
It's just going to drive it, not even underground, but it's just going to drive it further away.

21:51.660 --> 21:57.520
It's going to mean that, okay, it might mean that these currencies don't have as high a

21:57.520 --> 22:02.280
dollar value, but does that even really matter if you're actually trading in the currency

22:02.280 --> 22:04.040
itself?

22:04.040 --> 22:09.560
It's going to kind of separate the two systems in my mind.

22:09.560 --> 22:13.120
Maybe I'm totally wrong about this, but that's the feeling that I get.

22:13.120 --> 22:16.480
Not now, but long term, this is the effect that it'll have.

22:16.480 --> 22:17.480
I think I disagree.

22:17.480 --> 22:24.480
I think it's going to legitimize the currencies, because it adds a tangible aspect to them

22:24.480 --> 22:28.480
that the government is recognizing, quantifying, and taxing them.

22:28.480 --> 22:33.960
It creates a legal framework around the cryptocurrency that takes it out of a gray space and brings

22:33.960 --> 22:40.400
it clearly into the financial regulations, which means real speculators, real financial

22:40.400 --> 22:45.360
people can start to treat this as a commodity that they can trade in without legal ambiguity.

22:45.360 --> 22:49.600
It's actually, I think, going to be a huge boost for cryptocurrencies in Russia, because

22:49.600 --> 22:51.000
now it's not a gray market item.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.400
It's legally being recognized.

22:52.400 --> 22:58.240
Well, yeah, but what about people who want it to be gray area or even worse than that?

22:58.240 --> 23:05.200
People who want to conduct criminal activity using it, they're still going to use cryptocurrencies

23:05.200 --> 23:08.200
for that, even if it is legitimized.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.200
Maybe it'll be forks.

23:09.200 --> 23:14.100
Maybe it'll be new currencies coming along, but you're not going to get rid of that kind

23:14.100 --> 23:17.800
of activity by regulation, because they don't care about regulation.

23:17.800 --> 23:18.800
100%.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.080
And that's the beauty of it.

23:20.080 --> 23:26.240
There will always be a viral aspect to cryptocurrencies that gray and black markets can trade in,

23:26.240 --> 23:30.000
and they'll be able to trade up into Bitcoin, which is going to be the beauty of it for

23:30.000 --> 23:31.520
them.

23:31.520 --> 23:36.760
And so there will be a legitimacy, quote unquote, facade placed on cryptocurrencies.

23:36.760 --> 23:40.900
But the just sort of wild west nature of cryptocurrencies means there's always going to be new ones

23:40.900 --> 23:44.760
created every single day that the speed of government can't keep up with, that the black

23:44.760 --> 23:48.260
market could take advantage of and adapt very quickly to.

23:48.260 --> 23:52.360
And it's just going to be a lot more of what we see today.

23:52.360 --> 23:56.240
In some ways, Russia is ahead of many other countries with this.

23:56.240 --> 24:01.840
Well, that's true, because we're starting to see plans for regulation, whereas Russia

24:01.840 --> 24:03.680
is just going ahead and doing it.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.760
And the sandbox idea is not a bad one.

24:05.760 --> 24:10.800
It's like, here's a safe space where we won't come after you, where you can prove a concept

24:10.800 --> 24:14.180
to us, and we will bless it from beginning to end.

24:14.180 --> 24:17.360
And if you think about that, the market's going to like that, because that's going to

24:17.360 --> 24:19.920
be something safe for businesses to bet on.

24:19.920 --> 24:25.160
And so you think that this is going to mean a massive rise in the value of Bitcoin, basically?

24:25.160 --> 24:26.800
I think it's going to be good for Bitcoin.

24:26.800 --> 24:31.120
Yeah, I think we're going to look at the $5,000 plus price today.

24:31.120 --> 24:36.240
And it will be, we'll look back at that, go, yeah, remember when it was below $7,000?

24:36.240 --> 24:38.880
I'm not saying anytime soon, and things can change.

24:38.880 --> 24:43.960
But typically, this stuff ends up in the long run being a boost for Bitcoin.

24:43.960 --> 24:45.800
It has every single time so far.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.320
OK, well, I'm going to ask you to go out on a limb here.

24:49.320 --> 24:55.600
Give me the dollar value of Bitcoin one year, five years, and 10 years from now.

24:55.600 --> 24:56.760
Couldn't do it, Jill.

24:56.760 --> 25:01.520
If you had told me today that it was over $5,000 US greenbacks, I would have told you,

25:01.520 --> 25:02.520
no way.

25:02.520 --> 25:06.840
And so now it seems like $10,000 is the next threshold.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.280
I think all bets are off.

25:08.280 --> 25:09.860
I think it's probably going to get there.

25:09.860 --> 25:14.240
And once it gets there, people are either going to freak out and sell, or it's going

25:14.240 --> 25:19.280
to enter the radars of the really big investors, the people who buy really expensive commodities.

25:19.280 --> 25:20.600
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.960
As we record this, it's over $6,000.

25:23.960 --> 25:24.960
$6,143.

25:24.960 --> 25:28.160
Yeah, it has been for a while, I think.

25:28.160 --> 25:32.480
I've stopped watching it closely because it just drives me crazy.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.440
It really is something to watch this.

25:34.440 --> 25:37.560
Every time I see this, I think to myself, I should still be doing Plan B, because this

25:37.560 --> 25:39.200
is really something to watch this.

25:39.200 --> 25:43.200
Well, I'm sure this is a topic that we're going to return to on future shows.
