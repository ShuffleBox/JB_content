00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,600
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 191, recorded on May 30, 2021, from an undisclosed

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,600
location.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,600
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,600
And I'm Wes.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,600
Hello, Wes.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,600
Let's do the news.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,360
And we start this week with a follow-up to the FreeNode exodus we discussed last week.

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,240
As we record, there have been a number of new developments.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,760
After the staff revolt, FreeNode management took over hundreds of IRC channels for what

10
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,320
they called policy violations.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,240
Essentially, channels that referenced moving to Libera chat were seized and repermissioned.

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,040
This just seems like really weak sauce on FreeNodes part 700 channels being impacted.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
That's a major blunder.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,240
And it sounds like a poorly written script just went loose and caused lots of problems.

15
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,740
And it doesn't make one confident that the new team running this thing has the experience

16
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,880
or ability to run a large scale IRC network.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:06,640
To make matters worse, the new management seems to be a bit fluid in their interpretation

18
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,260
of the network's policies.

19
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,840
Several days ago, FreeNode modified its off topic use policy, forbidding inappropriate

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,040
advertising to read.

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,080
Off topic channels are required to act in good faith in accordance to the FreeNode community

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:28,920
as a whole, and went on to define inappropriate advertising to include, quote, unused channels

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,400
for the purpose of polluting the channel list results.

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,360
Or put another way, I think they're saying empty rooms that are just pointing users to

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,320
another server are not permitted.

26
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,780
So it appears, at least for a while, that the new FreeNode management had chosen to

27
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:53,280
interpret its rules in a way that basically disallows the promotion of competing services

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,840
or networks.

29
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,940
But as we record today, the policies have been updated again and no longer include that

30
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:07,540
specific language, instead just listing advertising more generally.

31
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:13,440
In response to the criticism of the channel takeovers, the new king of FreeNode, Andrew

32
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,640
Lee, posted a global notice across the network stating in the recent policy enforcement,

33
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,800
some channels were erroneously included, we greatly apologize for the inconvenience.

34
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,760
Now I'll just say that this has been a very complicated story since we started covering

35
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
it.

36
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,280
And it's definitely warranted a bit of a wait and see approach until more details could

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,160
come to light.

38
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,920
But right now, we've waited.

39
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,440
And I think unfortunately, we're seeing.

40
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:48,100
I mean, even if you kind of interpret these actions in the most charitable light possible,

41
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,600
as you mentioned, Chris, it's kind of just sloppy.

42
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,720
It doesn't give me a lot of faith that these new stewards are in it for the best aspects

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,160
of the community.

44
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,640
And while clearly FreeNode needed some cleaning up before all this incident, it seems like

45
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,560
Libera Chat is off to a surprisingly good start with some new energy and momentum.

46
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,640
And it might end up being in a better position than the previous incarnation of FreeNode

47
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,640
ever was.

48
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,720
And that's really it, Wes, is I think if you just took the last two weeks in isolation,

49
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,400
you just forget about all of the previous history and all of the drama, and you just

50
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,040
look at the two networks as two competing options for IRC users, Libera Chat has a really

51
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,200
good track record the last couple of weeks.

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,240
They have scaled up in response to an inundation of users and new rooms.

53
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,760
They've also been keeping up for the most part with support tickets and communicating

54
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,160
through social media outlets in a way that has been consistent and welcoming.

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,320
And over on the FreeNode side, there continues to be decisions that were apparent accidents

56
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,520
that maybe didn't mean to be done, but just, oops, everybody got upset and more people

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,520
left.

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,920
And that has been a pattern we're seeing over on the FreeNode side now.

59
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,760
And I think there's a statement that Andrew Lee gave to the register that, and it's a

60
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,200
longer statement, but a part of it that I think really encapsulates where Mr. Lee's

61
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,200
head is at.

62
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,960
I understand the frustration these people feel after making decisions.

63
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
They regret.

64
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:18,680
And if my being a target of their attack gives them purpose in life, I'm very happy and honored

65
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,680
to be able to give them such purpose.

66
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,380
I don't know how all the damage and attack on me helps push their agenda, though.

67
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,280
The battle I'm fighting isn't about me.

68
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,840
It's about FOSS and the internet.

69
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,440
If that just doesn't give you a little insight into where Mr. Lee's mindset is at, he's the

70
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,200
victim in this scenario.

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,320
And I think just looking at Liberia Chat two weeks on, I'm pretty impressed, Wes.

72
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,240
Realistically, I've been thinking, what should Jupiter Broadcasting do?

73
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,480
Should I move from GeekShed, which has been great, to Liberia Chat just to take advantage

74
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,360
of the fact that a lot of our listeners may have set up connections to Liberia Chat now,

75
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,040
and we'd like to be in on that conversation and hang out with all of our friends in the

76
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
free software community.

77
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:08,160
And I've been thinking about it, because it's just, I don't know, it's fun to see excitement

78
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,060
in some ways and people using IRC again, but then part of me thinks maybe I should stay

79
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,360
on GeekShed because maybe it would be great to have multiple large IRC networks and not

80
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,920
just one large IRC network.

81
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,080
That's one of the beauties of IRC is it's an open protocol.

82
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,680
It does seem like they've got some great momentum going.

83
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,960
Users who've stood up, helped organize things in an atmosphere of confusion and chaos.

84
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,320
And of course, with this exodus we mentioned, they've got some new converts over to their

85
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,000
network.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,240
Folks like Gentoo, Fedora, and Ubuntu all having jumped ship and finding a new home

87
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,640
over on Liberia Chat.

88
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,480
I still think there's a bit of a wait and see aspect here though, because really in

89
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,780
the IRC world, it's the community and the users and the channels that are going to decide

90
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,520
what happens here.

91
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,760
Good news, everybody.

92
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,280
Pwned passwords has gone open source.

93
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:09,520
Now, if you're not familiar, pwned passwords is the password search specific feature for

94
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,840
the have I been pwned service, which aggregates all kinds of information from those data breaches

95
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:21,720
that are always going on and tries to let you know when your information has been breached.

96
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,960
Since its inception, it's really grown and now serves close to 1 billion requests per

97
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,640
month.

98
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,420
We should be clear though, because it's a little confusing.

99
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,840
The entire organization and website have I been pwned is in the process of going open

100
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,960
source and the pwned passwords search feature, that's the first step and one of the pieces

101
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,520
we actually have code for now.

102
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,040
Interestingly too, the project is joining the.NET Foundation and it will be the.NET

103
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,380
Foundation's first incubation project, Troy Hunt, the original project author, and he's

104
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,200
also a Microsoft regional director.

105
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,240
He built the service on Azure, so it kind of makes sense that it could end up here.

106
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,080
He's open sourced the code for the pwned password search, so that way the project has a sustainable

107
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,720
future and can start receiving community contributions.

108
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,160
Troy put it pretty elegantly, but in short it was, this has been a great tool for the

109
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,400
community, now it's time for the community to take care of the tool.

110
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,200
For their part, the.NET Foundation will be providing various supportive structure and

111
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:26,280
services, think things like mentorship, sponsors, and administrative and technical services

112
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,680
of all the other boring business like things that just need to happen in the background.

113
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:39,080
More interestingly though, Troy Hunt also announced a partnership with the FBI.

114
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,120
Apparently they reached out to him and were wondering if they could submit fresh compromised

115
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,960
passwords to the pwned password service.

116
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,960
How about that, Chris?

117
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:53,320
I was like, wow, kind of spooky, but then I started thinking about it and it does make

118
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
sense.

119
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,160
As Hunt explained, the FBI is really involved in all kinds of investigations, they come

120
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:06,720
across all kinds of botnets and compromised passwords, so why not take that time that

121
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,400
public money paid for to collect that information and give it back to a centralized database

122
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,440
that can help people stay protected?

123
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,720
It could be extremely valuable, fresh, relevant information that could be continually being

124
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
added.

125
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:23,960
Assuming, you know, that the partnership works out and that the information they submit is

126
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,560
accessible by us average folk.

127
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,320
It's kind of great to see the normally very secretive FBI opening up a little bit and

128
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,880
working with open source.

129
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,640
And speaking of secrets being revealed, the world was changed forever this week when Google's

130
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:48,600
long in development, from scratch, Linux competitor of an operating system, Fuchsia OS, finally

131
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,560
shipped.

132
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,320
Some owners of the first generation Nest Hub received an update this week that changed

133
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,720
the device to Fuchsia instead of the normally Linux based Cast OS it was running before.

134
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,920
In place upgrade, how about that?

135
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,800
Yeah, kind of sneaky, you got to be in the preview program right now to get it.

136
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,640
It'll roll it out to everybody else over time, though, you're not really going to notice

137
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,320
because the front end UI that the user experiences is a flutter based UI.

138
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,840
So it runs the same on Linux and Fuchsia, so you're not really gonna be able to tell.

139
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:34,320
However, if you go into the Google Home app, and you go into the settings for that Nest

140
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,440
Hub, and you look at the legal notices, you'll notice there's a difference between them,

141
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,680
I believe, because when I tap mine right now, I get a local port that's running actually

142
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,680
on the Nest Hub, and it gives me the Android Apache license.

143
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
So I'm going to keep checking that I am in the preview program.

144
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,080
But as far as I can tell, I'm not I haven't switched over yet.

145
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,240
But like I say, I may not actually even be able to tell once it's happened.

146
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,660
It's like the most low key rollout of this OS we've been talking about forever.

147
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,520
We really have been talking about it forever, or at least you have.

148
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:12,680
I mean, way back in 2016, I remember you covering the speculation when we first heard rumors

149
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
about Fuchsia.

150
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,320
I think that was Linux action show episode 431.

151
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,060
Yeah, yeah, the rumors of a Fuchsia OS.

152
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,600
And the original articles are still on the web.

153
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,480
And it's so funny, because even back then we could smell it was a Linux replacement.

154
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,840
Yeah, I think you picked up on that right away.

155
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,800
It was also interesting to see that even way back then they were planning to use Flutter

156
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,760
and Dart, which was kind of strange, because even this year, we're introducing Flutter

157
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,120
and Dart as something new that we kind of, you know, explain to folks that aren't in

158
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,040
that space.

159
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,680
Fascinating to see how long it takes for these things to actually get anywhere close to maturity.

160
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,280
Even at the scale of Google, you don't launch these things and switch over in a night or

161
00:10:53,280 --> 00:11:00,120
a year or even a few years, which is why being here now having followed it, it's both notable

162
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,160
that we're seeing Fuchsia out in the wild and kind of extremely unremarkable.

163
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,680
It's boring and we've expected it for a while.

164
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,400
But in all of this, I mean, it's still quite early and probably we'll see more of these

165
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:17,440
devices switching out to Fuchsia sometime in the future.

166
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,680
Yeah, I could see that.

167
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,280
I could see a lot of their kind of low-resource IoT style devices getting Fuchsia and then

168
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,440
maybe another partner like Samsung and it kind of just grows from there.

169
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,840
And then, you know, years down the road, now it's the phones and then it's the tablets

170
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,760
and then it's it's the Chromebooks.

171
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,480
It's just all one little little chunk of land at a time.

172
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,840
And if you're curious to see what Fuchsia is like, well, some developers out there that

173
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,120
have put a lot of effort into making kind of like a mix of Fuchsia and Linux decided

174
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,920
to put together a project called Portable Fuchsia Emulator or F image.

175
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,440
It just simply packages up the minimum you need to get a Fuchsia OS environment up and

176
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,440
running in an emulator, and it includes a pre-built version of Fuchsia itself.

177
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,200
And I mean, it's bare bones, but you can get in there, you can play around with and actually

178
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,680
see what this environment is like.

179
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,840
Now do keep in mind that what you'll have there is just the publicly available stuff

180
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,040
in Google's open source code dumps of Fuchsia, just like how the Android open source project

181
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,600
AOSP doesn't contain a whole bunch of the enhancement you've come to expect on your

182
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,920
Google Pixel phone.

183
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:27,560
This Fuchsia experience is likewise quite bare, but it's interesting to try and it really

184
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,200
is easy to get going.

185
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,400
You just hop on over to the GitHub page, which we'll have linked in the show notes, download

186
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,080
a big old zip file of the emulator and the emulators base image, and then run a couple

187
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,580
command lines on your Linux install and you'll be playing with Fuchsia in no time.

188
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,820
Unless you're spending all your time playing on your new portable switch like Steam gaming

189
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,240
PC running Linux.

190
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,180
Well, at least that's the rumor that just won't quit.

191
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,540
And Sam Makovic over at Ars Technica says that Valve has been secretly building a switch

192
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,280
like portable PC designed to run a large number of the games you see on Steam.

193
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,960
And yes, it would be running Linux and supply chain willing could actually ship by the end

194
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,960
of the year.

195
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
How do we know this?

196
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:18,160
Well, on Tuesday, Steam DB operator Pavel Jundic spotted the change in Steam's code,

197
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,280
which pointed to a new device named Steam Pal.

198
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:28,000
This mysterious device is very likely the subject of an announcement Valve co-founder

199
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:47,840
Gabe Newell hinted at in a recent panel discussion earlier this month.

200
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,560
That was leaked audio from the event.

201
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,560
And unlike the Nintendo Switch, the Steam Pal will likely have a system on a chip that's

202
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,800
something from Intel or AMD and not an ARM system.

203
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,840
That's going to be interesting to see how that works.

204
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,320
And it's unclear if Valve is going to have like multiple skews of this where you can

205
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,640
have like different performance levels and battery life levels and, you know, other things

206
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,000
in that regard.

207
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,200
And really, to be frank, I don't really have a lot of hopes.

208
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,900
You know, I felt like I got a little burned on the Steam machines thing.

209
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,560
But when you hear Gabe talk about it, and he's hinting pretty strong like this is going

210
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:30,760
to happen, it seems like it might be more locked in than things typically are with the

211
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:36,360
disclosure that Valve is a very unique company with a very unique company structure and a

212
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,720
very unique company timeframe known as Valve time.

213
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,780
Yeah, that's right.

214
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:46,480
We should be clear that the Steam Pal is still very much in the prototype stage and its features

215
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,120
are subject to change as we've seen with other prototype hardware like Steam VR and the Steam

216
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,760
Controller.

217
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,520
But it does seem like the Steam Pal is being built with Linux in mind, which makes a lot

218
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:05,440
of sense when you look at the investment Valve has made in Linux and gaming and compatibility

219
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
and Proton.

220
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,200
They really put a lot of dollars and time into this.

221
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,220
And you could kind of see how passing on a per device cost for something like a Windows

222
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,720
license wouldn't really play in a price sensitive mobile gaming market.

223
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,520
I would like to thank two of our sponsors for making this episode possible.

224
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,360
And we start with Linode at Linode.com slash LAN, go there to get a $100 60 day credit

225
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,560
towards a new account.

226
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,880
And of course, you support the show Yeah, $100.

227
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,080
And no matter what skill level you're at noob or total expert, you're going to be happy

228
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,080
with Linode.

229
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,200
They are the largest independent cloud right there.

230
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
That's worth it.

231
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,080
11 data centers around the world right there.

232
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
I love it.

233
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,960
Super fast networking between the data centers and to the internet in general.

234
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,400
Really quick SSDs.

235
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,280
They're dedicated CPU rigs are crazy fast.

236
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,120
They have dedicated GPU rigs and the value is there 30 to 50% cheaper than quote unquote

237
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,480
big cloud and Linode started in 2003.

238
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,280
They've been doing this for like ever in internet terms like when Linux was still figuring out

239
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,480
how to do virtualization Linode was there.

240
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,680
They're like, all right, let's go.

241
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,680
Let's figure this out.

242
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Let's build something.

243
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,040
And they've stuck with it and they've refined it over the years and they've made it fantastic.

244
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,440
Now here I come along like a couple of years ago I discovered Linode I'm like, let's give

245
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
it a go.

246
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
I've heard about Linode forever.

247
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,600
I've seen them at tech events, you know, specifically the free software open source community events.

248
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,760
Obviously, I've seen them sponsor some of the projects that I use and love.

249
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,200
So I knew about Linode, but I hadn't tried them before.

250
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,120
I tried them didn't have $100 credit like you get when you go to Linode.com slash LAN

251
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,840
and I was blown away.

252
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,560
It was like, you know, when you live in the uncanny valley of hosted services where it's

253
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,560
like it's really good.

254
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,320
It's like 90% of the way there.

255
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,880
But every now and then I got to do something that is just sort of outside the box.

256
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,080
And that's where they kind of landed that uncanny valley Linode it closes the gap.

257
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
It really does.

258
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:58,220
It is everything I need and then they back it up with amazing 24 seven customer support

259
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,840
by phone or by ticket.

260
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,580
And they're easy to use powerful cloud dashboard makes it totally simple to take advantage

261
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,280
of other services like their S3 compatible object storage, which Jupiter broadcasting

262
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:13,540
just uses the absolute snot out of they have cloud firewalls and they have simple one click

263
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,400
application deployments.

264
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,300
If a project you work with or a company or maybe it's a social event or religious event

265
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,640
and you want to get into live streaming, but you don't really want to participate in the

266
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,380
YouTube slog or the Twitch swamp, you ought to check out their one click deployment of

267
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,240
own cast, which is Twitch in a box and you can just go through their super easy to use

268
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,560
setup wizard.

269
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,160
They'll deploy the Linux stack and they'll deploy own cast and then it's all set up to

270
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,320
update from the repos.

271
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
It works really great.

272
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,880
And you got Twitch in a box.

273
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,780
You can also roll a machine and do peer tube.

274
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,780
That's the way I go.

275
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,720
But you got to appreciate projects like own cast to that make it so much more approachable

276
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,080
for people that are a little bit more casual about this kind of thing.

277
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,440
So you really got to go check it out for yourself.

278
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,160
And that credit that hundred dollar credit.

279
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
That's something I didn't have.

280
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,840
I, you know, I was on the fence and if I would have a hundred dollars, I think I would have

281
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,360
started using Linode a lot sooner.

282
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,760
So go to Linode dot com slash land.

283
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,060
Get that a one hundred dollar 60 day credit on your new account and support the show and

284
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:14,320
make it possible for this here humble podcast to be free for everyone to listen to Linode

285
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,340
dot com slash land.

286
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,380
Also a big thank you to my mobile provider, my mobile provider for years.

287
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:28,360
Go to Linux dot ting dot com and get 25 bucks off amazing wireless rates.

288
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,280
If you're sick of paying for cell service and I can't imagine that you're not, you really

289
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,600
should go see how much you can save and then take 25 bucks off that at Linux dot ting dot

290
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
com.

291
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,040
You know, I really like Ting's new simple plans.

292
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,980
I've been around for a while, so I've seen them try a couple of different takes at this.

293
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,640
And with this new generation of ting plans, they've they've just nailed it.

294
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,380
I'm going to tell you about their set 12 plans, but I encourage you to go to Linux dot ting

295
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,560
dot com and check them all out.

296
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,640
And what I like about the set 12 plan is it gives you 12 gigs of data.

297
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,640
All right.

298
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,640
Now, if you if you sync your podcast and your your music before you get on the road, 12

299
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,020
gigs of data is is a ton to work with.

300
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:07,240
But here's what I love because it's 35 bucks a month and you get unlimited calls and texts,

301
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
right?

302
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,480
So 12 gigs of data and unlimited calls and texts.

303
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,440
And then you can add data, of course, and they have other plans.

304
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,320
I mean, you can you can just go to town with the data if you want.

305
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,700
They got plans for that, too.

306
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,160
So there's a perfect fit for you.

307
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,820
But I think that set 12 is really clever if you're just smart about how you use your data

308
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,860
a little bit.

309
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:29,200
You could really save $35 a month for a phone bill is just well, I mean, when's the last

310
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
time you've seen that?

311
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,640
I don't even want to tell you what some of my family members are paying.

312
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,920
I tried to tell them and try to tell them that's why I move as many of them.

313
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,480
I can't move them over.

314
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,380
I mean, the Ting dashboard that switches them to when I show them that like, oh, that's

315
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,380
way better.

316
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,580
But, you know, you look at these prices now and these new these new plans they have.

317
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,580
It's really appealing.

318
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,840
It's simple to switch to Ting and pretty much any phone's going to work on Ting because

319
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,480
they have several networks they support.

320
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,000
So go to Linux.ting.com, check your current phone, then go create an account and pick

321
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,320
the plan that's right for you.

322
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,760
You can either get a new device or, you know, bring your own and save some money.

323
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,160
And then Ting's going to send you a SIM card if you keep your phone, they're just going

324
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
to send you a SIM card.

325
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
You pop that in.

326
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,720
And then like a couple more minutes after that, you go through their website and you're

327
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
done.

328
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,060
You're like emancipated from your horrible monopolistic carrier.

329
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,560
And you're now on Ting picking and choosing your network with your unlimited calls and

330
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,880
your unlimited decks and the data plan that fits your needs.

331
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,800
I mean, it's just it's just so simple.

332
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,400
And it just gets even easier when you take 25 bucks off the top.

333
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,860
So go to Linux.ting.com, support the show and save some money.

334
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,600
The next generation of Ting Mobile is here.

335
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,740
So go see how much you could save and get 25 bucks off at Linux.ting.com.

336
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:41,540
The new owners of Audacity continue to make news, and it's not the good kind.

337
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:47,280
This week, they announced a contributor license agreement will be added to the project, also

338
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,160
known as a CLA for short.

339
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,600
Future contributors to Audacity will be expected to sign this new agreement in order to add

340
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,840
any code to the project.

341
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,400
A GitHub discussion post titled information about our new contributor license agreement

342
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,840
explained that the purpose of the CLA is to provide future flexibility in altering by

343
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:17,400
e up licensing or dual licensing for the entire Audacity project, not just the parts of the

344
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,720
code that we have written ourselves.

345
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,680
I mean, obviously, the concept of a CLA isn't new to open source.

346
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,040
That's not the issue here.

347
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,040
I think it's that simply put the it's new to Audacity.

348
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,220
That's really the issue.

349
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,360
And it's a huge change right after the whole telemetry debacle and just shocks to the system

350
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,360
in general about the announcement.

351
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,320
So that sort of while everybody's still reeling from that, unlike the quote unquote, fake

352
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:47,240
news telemetry announcement, the CLA has had some but not nearly as severe of a reaction.

353
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,380
And it seems like the messaging has been left to Audacity's new boss, Martin Curie to just

354
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:58,120
gather feedback, quote unquote, but really his contributions to the conversation have

355
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:04,800
pretty much just been the CLA was always going to be an issue many contributors would find

356
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
unpopular.

357
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,320
Yeah, and that's just kind of his take on it.

358
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,040
Yeah, yeah, we knew this one's gonna be a problem.

359
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,960
But look, we got plans, you know, we got things we want to do.

360
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,520
This is the quintessential free audio editor, you know, it's currently licensed under the

361
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
GPL two.

362
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,120
And it seems there is an update in the works to take this thing to GPL three.

363
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,440
And I think that transition has brought up this conversation.

364
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,320
And in defense of them implementing a CLA, they cited platforms such as Apple's App Store

365
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,280
that require software to be dual licensed, that you can't just ship a GPL two or three

366
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,960
app on the App Store because they're going to go make millions on the App Store.

367
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,800
It requires all of this effort.

368
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:47,560
However, you can find plenty of examples of GPL software on the App Store.

369
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,480
Nextcloud being one of the larger ones, Telegram is GPL as well.

370
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,720
Some of them have come up with clever dual licensing scheme, some of them have come up

371
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,200
with copying comments that make things clear.

372
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,680
I just I feel like you can find hundreds even, I'll link to a list of hundreds of open source

373
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,600
of various open source licenses that we know that are in the App Store today and don't

374
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
have CLA's.

375
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
Some of them do.

376
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,100
But there's clearly been proof in the public that it's possible.

377
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,840
With the challenge being here, of course, that Audacity is such an old project, lots

378
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,980
of contributors, etc, etc.

379
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,800
But you know, humanity is good at solving hard problems.

380
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,120
Yeah, there's a lot of things going on here.

381
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:29,300
And I think there are some, let's say, adversarial readings of the initial post sort of explaining

382
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,380
the motivation for the CLA.

383
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,720
And yes, a CLA is not required to get a version of Audacity into the App Store.

384
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,600
But I think some kind of relicensing is.

385
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,240
Right now it's GPL v2 plus, which means it could be interpreted as GPL v3 as well.

386
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,160
And you're right, Chris, there are definitely some GPL projects up on the App Store.

387
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,720
But all the licenses of those, well, it's not really clear.

388
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,800
Telegram claims it's all GPL v2 for the client, but there's actually no license file in their

389
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,580
GitHub repository for it.

390
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:04,040
And there are some open issues questioning just what is the license here.

391
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,480
And as you mentioned, Nextcloud, well, they had to update things and actually add a specific

392
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,080
exception to the license, which I think technically changes the license from being GPL to being

393
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,360
GPL plus exception.

394
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,440
To do that in Audacity's case would require kind of the same effort that they're doing

395
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,800
with the CLA, namely going back, finding all the contributors who've got big major chunks

396
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,840
of code in the code base and getting them to sign off and agree that yes, okay, we're

397
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,680
okay with changing the license for the code we contributed and adding this exception.

398
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,560
So I think there's one version that you can understand from the project's perspective

399
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,120
or from a business perspective of you're taking the time right now to go through and contact

400
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,840
and find all these contributors, get them to approve this change.

401
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:48,600
In some ways, if you think you ever might need to do something like that again, it kind

402
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,160
of makes sense to get this done with the CLA so that you have that option and don't have

403
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,960
to repeat this in the future.

404
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:58,160
Again, I don't think it's necessary, but you can see how if you're already making that

405
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,320
effort from the business perspective, it makes sense to get things more in your control.

406
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Right.

407
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,840
And they've gone through a similar process with their MuseScore application.

408
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,960
In fact, they even talk about maybe potentially, they could, you know, the applications could

409
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,000
share code at some point, this could mean that Audacity could have VST three support.

410
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,320
And so when you lay it all out there and you make a pretty good case, I say I'm all for

411
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,640
the CLA actually, but what I'm also all for is a community fork of this thing.

412
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,320
I'd like both things to exist.

413
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:31,500
I would like a free, totally unencumbered version of Audacity that has no telemetry.

414
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,120
It has no CLA.

415
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,400
It is a true specimen of free software because at the end of the day, that's why Audacity

416
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,520
mattered more than anything else.

417
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,360
I mean, it is a tool that we use and it's an important tool, but it was also what it

418
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,360
represented.

419
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,980
It was a free software audio editor, the quintessential one.

420
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,000
And I feel like that on its own is important and should exist.

421
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,360
And so I would like to see a fork happen.

422
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,600
And then I would like to see Audacity proper, whatever you want to call it.

423
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:05,400
Go on, add your telemetry, add your CLA, add your VST support, share UI code and whatever

424
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
between Muse and this.

425
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I don't care.

426
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Let's see where it goes.

427
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Have at it.

428
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,360
You know, you've done your purchase.

429
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,360
You now own it.

430
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,580
You can control it.

431
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,580
Do what you like with it.

432
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,440
But I'd also like the fork to exist and see where both of them go.

433
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,360
And that's the beauty of open source.

434
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,360
You're right.

435
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,440
I mean, relicensing aside, as long as this thing is out in the open, no one can really

436
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,060
take it away from us.

437
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:32,000
And the flip side of that is reading through the discussions on this commentary on the

438
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,920
discussion post on GitHub.

439
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,920
It really is quite interesting.

440
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,120
There's a lot of names you might recognize in there.

441
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,480
If you're at all curious about this, folks like Hector Martin or Falk TX, the notable

442
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,600
Jack and Carla and Katia developer.

443
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,840
And one of his comments really stood out to me because he sort of mentioned he thought

444
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,760
about contributing to Audacity before, and I don't think he loves there being a CLA.

445
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,360
But he listed some of the reasons that, you know, it was hard to contribute to Audacity

446
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,200
problems, even just getting it to build on Linux.

447
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,400
And when you go look at some of the commits in just the recent past couple of days, the

448
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:10,260
past few weeks, those are things that this new team is clearly putting effort into.

449
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,960
It's hard to say I am of two minds because the GPL, especially in CLA's, it's a little

450
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,720
bit of a weird mix.

451
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,260
But if this actually means a lot of new core development for Audacity, it might just work

452
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,820
out for the best.

453
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,240
And I totally appreciate that the situation was easier for Nextcloud to deal with because

454
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,800
they were a newer, younger project that, you know, they could get access to the developers

455
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
that were active.

456
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,200
And Audacity has a much longer legacy than that.

457
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,040
But I can't help feel like there's a bit of a shared theme between our first story and

458
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
our last story.

459
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,800
You know, Freenode also involves a takeover that kind of comes in strong.

460
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,560
Maybe they don't fully appreciate and understand the community and interact with the community

461
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,820
in a way that really is successful.

462
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,080
And there's a bit of a shock to the whole thing, too, which I feel like happened in

463
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,760
the Audacity case.

464
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,440
These parallels are playing out at the same time.

465
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,080
And I feel like it tells us a bigger meta story about corporate governance and free

466
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,040
software project takeovers.

467
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,720
And it seems like the lessons still haven't been learned.

468
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,680
You and I have some firsthand experiences with mergers and these kinds of mixes, and

469
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,920
sometimes they can go well and sometimes they can go wrong.

470
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:20,560
And I think we're kind of seeing a couple of them happen at the same time right now

471
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,180
that make me really uncomfortable.

472
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,560
And it makes me feel like if people just were a little bit better about managing community

473
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,300
and interacting a little more open to doing things in a different way with a different

474
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,720
culture than, you know, Bill, this is how the business does it and this is how the lawyers

475
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
tell us to do it.

476
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,000
So we're always going to do it this way.

477
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,120
And maybe being a little more receptive to how the free software community works, like

478
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:46,560
just those basics, Wes, just those basics, Wes, would make such a huge difference in

479
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
these transitions.

480
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,400
And it's funny we're seeing them play out at the same time, in my opinion.

481
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,440
No, you're absolutely right.

482
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,840
But I think it's kind of a little bit on both sides.

483
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,760
And it highlights the tension between, you know, open source and the community and the

484
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,120
grassroots nature of it and the business side, which often provides a lot of the funding

485
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,580
and of course, leverages open source to no end for their own profits.

486
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,580
And that's where it's hard.

487
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,800
We have a lot of discussions about how we fund open source development, how do we make

488
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,600
sure that the, you know, the free software we use and love and rely on keeps going, but

489
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,360
we seem to then also throw up a lot of barriers when there might be some interest in funding

490
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,360
it.

491
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:30,060
I don't think we have a solid idea yet of exactly how we want these different, but aligned

492
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,500
communities to really work together in the long run.

493
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,640
It is an age old problem, sustainable development and funding of that software development,

494
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:43,080
which is inherently expensive, and the freedom and flexibility to be a free software project

495
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,340
that truly is about its users first and not monetization.

496
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,480
And it is such a tricky balance to get right.

497
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,560
And we're watching it play out right now on two really important backbone pieces for the

498
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,220
open source community, Audacity, the audio editor and Freenode, the chat network.

499
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:04,860
But looking forward, it seems that Tesla is looking at funding some Linux development.

500
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:11,520
They have an opening right now for Linux game development at Tesla.

501
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,440
The job post that we found reads, some of you might have heard our dear Techno King

502
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:24,560
is bullish on games and making an awesome platform for all gamers in Tesla vehicles.

503
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:29,040
The latest Model S on our website can give you a hint of what we're aiming for in terms

504
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,360
of platform compatibility.

505
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,920
Sorry, can't divulge much more for now.

506
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:38,840
The Tesla infotainment OS and platform software are based on a standard Linux.

507
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:44,800
So of course, we're interested in helping the gaming community make Linux gaming excellent.

508
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,840
Yeah, they have several open Linux positions.

509
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,620
I knew that.

510
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,240
And we'll link to this one just because gaming is so funny.

511
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,040
And it's so funny when you think of a car company picturing the user playing games in

512
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,740
the car, but it's obviously a way to kill time while you're waiting to charge.

513
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,740
Why not?

514
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,120
I mean, you got like, you know, maybe 20 to 40 minutes you need to charge up your car

515
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,560
at a supercharger or something.

516
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,940
Maybe you're on a road trip, get out, stretch your legs, and then you got a few more minutes

517
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,940
to kill.

518
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:15,800
So why not do some gaming on your huge RS Tesla screen?

519
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
I love it Wes.

520
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,200
It sounds like they're looking for candidates with experience and excitement for building

521
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,780
open source software based on open source stacks, things like Linux, Mesa, Vulkan, OpenGL.

522
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:32,960
And hey, maybe you even have some experience with Proton, Lutris, or Wine.

523
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,720
They also know that they want folks who are happy and willing to contribute back up to

524
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
the community.

525
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,280
I wonder what kind of Tesla authored commits we might be seeing.

526
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,720
I say it's going to be a flop, Wes.

527
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,160
I mean, who needs this when you're going to have your Steam pal with you in the car, right?

528
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,840
This is who needs any of that.

529
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,280
But whichever one of these mobile Linux gaming monsters ships, and of course, all the other

530
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:56,180
things that happen in the world of Linux and open source, we'll let you know right here

531
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,180
every single week.

You digital nomads out there, don't miss this week's Linux Unplugged.

535
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:14,520
My guest tells me how he learned Linux and built a total automation system in his school

536
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,320
bus that he's converted into a home.

537
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:21,240
It's an incredible journey of learning and it will be in Linux Unplugged episode 408

538
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,840
at linuxunplugged.com slash 408 when it publishes.

539
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:30,240
As for us, we'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open

540
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,560
source news.

541
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:57,160
Thanks for joining us and we will see you next week.
