Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.600 --> 00:21.240
This is episode 85 recorded on December 21st, 2018.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.240
I'm Chris.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.240
And I'm Joe.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.240
Hello, Joe.

00:24.240 --> 00:29.840
It's good to be connected with you because today is an episode of the most definitive

00:29.840 --> 00:33.080
series, like the things that defined 2018.

00:33.080 --> 00:38.120
And if there was one person, one man I could choose to talk to about this, it would be

00:38.120 --> 00:39.340
you, Joe.

00:39.340 --> 00:43.000
And I think we've got to start with Red Hat.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
What do you say?

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
Yeah.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.120
The news that absolutely dominated at least the second half of the year was that IBM was

00:48.120 --> 00:49.120
going to buy Red Hat.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.880
It sent shockwaves through the whole open source community.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.360
I'm still feeling those shockwaves.

00:54.360 --> 00:59.280
Yeah, not only that, but really, if you think about it, let's back up a little bit.

00:59.280 --> 01:05.240
I mean, the year starts really with Red Hat announcing they're acquiring Core OS.

01:05.240 --> 01:13.520
In January 2018, Red Hat announced for a mere $250 million, they would be purchasing one

01:13.520 --> 01:18.840
of the most surprising and exciting upcoming Linux distributions, Core OS.

01:18.840 --> 01:21.960
And then the rest of 2018 was really, how are they going to integrate them?

01:21.960 --> 01:26.320
Yeah, well, it wasn't until June that we found out exactly what was happening with Core OS.

01:26.320 --> 01:30.880
And that was when they announced Fedora Core OS, which amused quite a few of us harking

01:30.880 --> 01:33.920
back to the old Fedora Core name.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.320
That was my favorite part of the whole thing.

01:36.320 --> 01:41.480
Although with the other things that have happened with Red Hat this year, it's sort of just

01:41.480 --> 01:45.080
been put on stasis.

01:45.080 --> 01:48.120
We haven't really seen a lot develop there.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.840
But that doesn't mean that things from that general area have settled down.

01:51.840 --> 01:57.280
In fact, this year, Red Hat managed to hit 1.0 on Red Hat Stratus, which is a storage

01:57.280 --> 02:00.480
project that I've been following with a lot of interest.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.500
It does look very, very interesting, doesn't it?

02:02.500 --> 02:09.200
This is their bet against ZFS because they, unlike Canonical, don't seem to think that

02:09.200 --> 02:11.020
they can ship ZFS.

02:11.020 --> 02:12.560
So they need an alternative.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.040
And it does look like a really well thought out project.

02:15.040 --> 02:19.040
We did a special on it recently on Linux Unplugged.

02:19.040 --> 02:25.360
However, just in this last month, the ZFS leadership, or ZFS leadership, has decided

02:25.360 --> 02:29.720
to rebase a lot of the different projects on ZFS for Linux.

02:29.720 --> 02:36.280
So the ZFS on Linux that is shipping will be the authoritative version of ZFS.

02:36.280 --> 02:40.120
So Red Hat Stratus has more competition.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.640
But the licensing issue hasn't gone away.

02:42.640 --> 02:47.440
Canonical seem to be doing fine with it and have got away with it, for want of a better

02:47.440 --> 02:51.760
deal, but Red Hat just don't want to go down that route.

02:51.760 --> 02:56.480
And I think that ultimately we're all going to benefit from that because if you've got

02:56.480 --> 03:01.520
two competing projects, and okay, Stratus is a long way off, it's certainly a long way

03:01.520 --> 03:06.740
behind ZFS, but with the resources that Red Hat have got, especially now that they've

03:06.740 --> 03:12.560
got the IBM money as well, maybe it won't be too long, maybe a year or two before we've

03:12.560 --> 03:17.080
got something that is approaching ZFS in terms of features.

03:17.080 --> 03:21.320
And that will hopefully foster good competition and drive them both forward.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.320
Hmm.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.320
I do like that.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.400
That is what I hope as well.

03:24.400 --> 03:28.380
And I wouldn't count Project Stratus out too from just a competitive standpoint because

03:28.380 --> 03:32.840
they're really basing it off of a bunch of comprehensive existing technologies baked

03:32.840 --> 03:37.120
into Linux and then bringing it all together with a comprehensive API.

03:37.120 --> 03:40.080
And the industry tends to respond really well to that.

03:40.080 --> 03:43.760
So Stratus has a huge potential in the marketplace.

03:43.760 --> 03:47.840
But in the meantime, ZFS isn't standing still.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.160
And I think that's probably good for everybody, right?

03:50.160 --> 03:53.820
I mean, it's really good to have competition in this area.

03:53.820 --> 03:57.720
So we've had a little while for the dust to settle on this announcement.

03:57.720 --> 04:02.640
And I remember at the time not being as worried as a lot of people.

04:02.640 --> 04:06.880
And I don't think that my opinion has changed over the last few months.

04:06.880 --> 04:07.880
How do you feel about it?

04:07.880 --> 04:09.800
Do you think that your attitude has changed?

04:09.800 --> 04:15.680
I have not yet really gotten enough data to make a new decision.

04:15.680 --> 04:21.440
I have, however, heard from a considerable amount of Red Hat employees.

04:21.440 --> 04:24.280
And they seem to be doing better with the news.

04:24.280 --> 04:25.800
This has been my data point, really.

04:25.800 --> 04:32.160
It has been, I would say, the day that you and I recorded the Linux action news that

04:32.160 --> 04:37.080
the IBM acquisition of Red Hat was announced, we recorded that.

04:37.080 --> 04:43.280
A little behind-the-scenes information for people is, Joe and I sometimes sit around

04:43.280 --> 04:48.760
and just shoot the shit for like an hour before we record.

04:48.760 --> 04:53.580
And because we did that, we happened to delay the recording just enough for the news to

04:53.580 --> 04:56.760
break on a Sunday, which never happens.

04:56.760 --> 05:00.940
That's why we record Linux action news on a Sunday, because there's no news on a Sunday.

05:00.940 --> 05:04.880
So you can summarize everything and get it out before the news cycle begins again.

05:04.880 --> 05:09.920
That's great, except IBM threw that whole thing off when they announced the acquisition

05:09.920 --> 05:11.960
of Red Hat.

05:11.960 --> 05:17.300
And while we were recording that episode, I must have heard from a dozen different Red

05:17.300 --> 05:21.560
Hat employees that were sending me messages, and they were freaking out.

05:21.560 --> 05:25.180
They were beside themselves.

05:25.180 --> 05:33.580
And then Monday, there was an all-staff meeting, which I had an opportunity to see.

05:33.580 --> 05:39.340
And the sentiment was mostly the same, that we're really doomed here.

05:39.340 --> 05:44.960
And then as time has gone on, a new mantra seems to have developed amongst the Red Hat

05:44.960 --> 05:45.960
crew.

05:45.960 --> 05:51.320
And it is one that is, maybe we can impart our culture upon IBM.

05:51.320 --> 05:56.320
Maybe IBM will be receptive, so that way they can stay competitive in the new marketplace.

05:56.320 --> 06:01.960
Maybe this is the perfect time for this acquisition, because we can impart something on IBM.

06:01.960 --> 06:05.560
I don't know if that's actually possible.

06:05.560 --> 06:12.400
So I, as an independent observer, remain a little skeptical of this entire acquisition.

06:12.400 --> 06:16.900
But I can tell you from the people that I've been communicating with, they have transitioned

06:16.900 --> 06:20.300
from freaking out to, there's some potential here.

06:20.300 --> 06:22.960
The people inside think there's potential.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.120
And that gives me some hope.

06:24.120 --> 06:27.200
Well, I've been positive from the start, and I haven't changed.

06:27.200 --> 06:33.120
I haven't seen any evidence that things have got worse, or are going to get worse.

06:33.120 --> 06:40.000
And it just means a load more money going into open source, $34 billion going into open

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
source effectively.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.320
And I don't see how that can be a bad thing.

06:44.320 --> 06:53.320
Okay, Red Hat are not sort of free software, and they're not doing it for ideological reasons.

06:53.320 --> 06:54.320
They are very pragmatic.

06:54.320 --> 06:58.960
They are a company who believes that open source is the best way to do things.

06:58.960 --> 07:03.080
And open source software is free software effectively.

07:03.080 --> 07:09.440
So basically, no one can complain, even if they do some pragmatic stuff like Fedora made

07:09.440 --> 07:13.000
it much easier to install proprietary drivers and things this year.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.800
But who cares?

07:14.800 --> 07:18.600
The underlying OS is still open source free software.

07:18.600 --> 07:22.400
And if you've got all that extra money going into it, it's got to be good.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.160
It's GPL code at the end of the day.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.760
And I have a couple of canaries in the coal mine.

07:27.760 --> 07:32.040
And the number one canary in the coal mine that I have, amongst my whole collection at

07:32.040 --> 07:34.980
this point, really, is Jim Whitehurst.

07:34.980 --> 07:41.320
If something happens to Jim, if he leaves, anything like that, that's the number one

07:41.320 --> 07:45.400
dead canary in the coal mine signal that something is wrong.

07:45.400 --> 07:51.620
And if he if he remains on board, and he continues to be public and communicate and tweet about

07:51.620 --> 07:56.360
what's going on and all those things, I think that's a sign that things are going well.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.040
And it's only one of many signs.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.040
It's not the only sign.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.160
I'm not saying that.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.440
But it is a good signal out of them.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.880
And so far, that's remained a pretty strong signal.

08:04.880 --> 08:09.040
Yeah, I think you're right that that would be a big red flag, but I don't think it's

08:09.040 --> 08:10.040
going to happen.

08:10.040 --> 08:13.160
I think if anything, it's going to go the other way and he's going to end up more senior

08:13.160 --> 08:16.720
at IBM and changing the culture over there.

08:16.720 --> 08:17.960
Yeah, I hope so.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.520
That's what the Red Hat employees hope.

08:19.520 --> 08:20.520
Yeah.

08:20.520 --> 08:23.920
And when I was going through the year's worth of news to collate all of this, one thing

08:23.920 --> 08:29.440
kept jumping out at me one word kept jumping out at me over and over again, in so many

08:29.440 --> 08:32.600
stories and that word was Microsoft.

08:32.600 --> 08:33.880
No surprise there.

08:33.880 --> 08:37.720
It's just been a huge year for them in the Linux and open source world, which is such

08:37.720 --> 08:39.460
a weird thing, isn't it?

08:39.460 --> 08:46.800
How can Microsoft this old enemy be so relevant to Linux and open source now?

08:46.800 --> 08:51.520
You've seen just such a huge shift there, and I think that apart from IBM buying Red

08:51.520 --> 08:55.840
Hat, the second biggest news story of the year was Microsoft buying GitHub.

08:55.840 --> 09:01.160
Well, is it GitHub or is it Microsoft joining the open invention network?

09:01.160 --> 09:02.160
I'm not sure.

09:02.160 --> 09:03.160
It's probably GitHub.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.160
Yeah, it's probably GitHub.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.160
Yeah, man.

09:05.160 --> 09:13.560
Git and all of the other things, them dropping Edge HTML for Chromium, all of this has just

09:13.560 --> 09:20.600
been almost at least every other week, almost to the to like the date, there is some major

09:20.600 --> 09:22.040
Microsoft news.

09:22.040 --> 09:26.120
Even this week, there is big Microsoft news that we're just not covering because of the

09:26.120 --> 09:29.480
nature of this episode.

09:29.480 --> 09:37.160
And I got to say, the last two years have been a process of me realizing that I was

09:37.160 --> 09:44.000
a child, and then I'm no longer a child, and that I had childish things that I thought

09:44.000 --> 09:46.560
were important that were not important.

09:46.560 --> 09:55.360
And it's been a little humbling, to be honest with you, because in the 90s and in early

09:55.360 --> 10:02.360
2000s, I built my whole career around fighting Microsoft, about building and providing better

10:02.360 --> 10:07.480
solutions than what you could accomplish on Windows.

10:07.480 --> 10:13.840
And back then, I was the only jackass saying you could do things with Apache and MySQL.

10:13.840 --> 10:17.680
You didn't need IIS and Microsoft SQL or Oracle.

10:17.680 --> 10:22.880
I was the jackass that was saying, why not host these files on a Samba server using

10:22.880 --> 10:25.880
XFS instead of a Windows server using NTFS?

10:25.880 --> 10:29.820
I was that guy, which is now the norm.

10:29.820 --> 10:30.960
Everybody says that now.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.480
It's the normal thing to recommend.

10:32.480 --> 10:40.440
But back then, to me, it was a religious battle, and I was fighting the good fight to defend

10:40.440 --> 10:46.640
Linux's honor against an onslaught of FUD by the Microsoft Corporation.

10:46.640 --> 10:50.000
And now I look back at that and I think, what was all of that about?

10:50.000 --> 10:53.600
What did I accomplish?

10:53.600 --> 10:59.800
Maybe you could say that all of us put in a good fight, and now Microsoft has been forced

10:59.800 --> 11:05.560
to do things the open source way, but I'm not sure that's actually the case.

11:05.560 --> 11:09.160
This year and last year have been really humbling for me.

11:09.160 --> 11:12.240
I think you should start a new podcast called The Linux Hipster.

11:12.240 --> 11:16.280
I was into Linux before anyone else was.

11:16.280 --> 11:18.400
I was into Linux before it was cool.

11:18.400 --> 11:23.320
I was into Linux before you could run it in a VPS.

11:23.320 --> 11:30.760
But isn't it true that Microsoft really have changed and that the Microsoft under the Balmer

11:30.760 --> 11:36.720
years is different from the Microsoft under Nadella?

11:36.720 --> 11:43.800
I would have said no until I went down there, and I was invited down there for Coder Radio

11:43.800 --> 11:49.760
to chat a little about what they're doing with.NET Core, which I now appreciate in

11:49.760 --> 11:50.960
a much different scale.

11:50.960 --> 11:57.240
But back then, it was really just about Microsoft open sourcing.NET Core, which now is one

11:57.240 --> 11:59.900
of many, many, many, many things they've open sourced.

11:59.900 --> 12:03.160
But back then, it was just that.

12:03.160 --> 12:09.240
I was trying to figure it out, because just for the audience, I've grown up, lived in

12:09.240 --> 12:10.960
the Pacific Northwest.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.440
Microsoft has been in my backyard my entire life.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.120
I have done contract work for Microsoft.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.000
I have done intern work for Microsoft.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.440
I have turned down multiple jobs for Microsoft.

12:20.440 --> 12:26.880
I've had many family members that work at Microsoft, more than a few, and also friends

12:26.880 --> 12:27.880
that work at Microsoft.

12:27.880 --> 12:33.600
So over the years, at least a dozen times a year, I'm down there at the campus, just

12:33.600 --> 12:35.000
down there for lunch even.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.020
And so I followed them very closely since they became a company.

12:41.020 --> 12:45.280
And I really hated them for the longest time.

12:45.280 --> 12:54.260
But I really have to say, later on, as really Balmer left and things changed, I got a greater

12:54.260 --> 12:59.920
appreciation through different interactions that I had opportunities to have that things

12:59.920 --> 13:01.420
were really changing.

13:01.420 --> 13:07.120
And I think the number one signal to me about this is a real change, not just a PR change,

13:07.120 --> 13:13.680
not just a Twitter message, but the real signal to me was that they were firing people.

13:13.680 --> 13:20.480
They were firing people that were longtime Microsoft veterans that were blocking this

13:20.480 --> 13:22.400
transition.

13:22.400 --> 13:27.640
And they were bringing in new people, like somebody I met in the.NET Core team, Joey.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.880
Joey, he's probably a listener of this show.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.840
He was a college student that ran Gen 2.

13:33.840 --> 13:40.440
And they brought him on to replace a 25-year Windows veteran, because that Windows veteran

13:40.440 --> 13:46.640
couldn't see things in the new paradigm, the new lens in which Microsoft looked at the

13:46.640 --> 13:47.640
market.

13:47.640 --> 13:51.280
But Joey, a college student Gen 2 user, could.

13:51.280 --> 13:55.640
Well one thing that I think we have to keep in mind here is that Microsoft is a large

13:55.640 --> 13:58.080
company that makes a lot of money.

13:58.080 --> 14:04.100
And OK, right now, they're focused on Linux and open source, because that is a good revenue

14:04.100 --> 14:05.680
stream for them.

14:05.680 --> 14:09.600
But that doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to be like that forever.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.960
So I think we have to treat this with some caution.

14:12.960 --> 14:17.100
But at the same time, I don't think that they should necessarily be judged as a company

14:17.100 --> 14:19.440
on their previous actions.

14:19.440 --> 14:22.040
I think we should judge each action as it comes.

14:22.040 --> 14:25.400
And them buying GitHub is a huge deal.

14:25.400 --> 14:28.680
And we have to watch to see what happens with that.

14:28.680 --> 14:32.600
And them joining the open invention network is clearly good.

14:32.600 --> 14:36.280
They've contributed all these patents for people to use.

14:36.280 --> 14:38.080
But I think we do have to keep an eye on them.

14:38.080 --> 14:41.640
They do have that bad history of Linux as a cancer and everything.

14:41.640 --> 14:45.560
And that might have been under a different regime, but it's still the same company.

14:45.560 --> 14:52.200
So I think just cautious optimism is the best approach when it comes to Microsoft and Linux.

14:52.200 --> 14:58.200
I would say I agree, only if you were willing to apply that same cautious optimism to every

14:58.200 --> 15:04.400
commercial company that is currently making revenue from open source services.

15:04.400 --> 15:08.280
2019 is really the year of services.

15:08.280 --> 15:11.400
Apple is going to try to make all of their money from services.

15:11.400 --> 15:16.240
All of the companies are, even the companies that were hardware based for the last 30 years

15:16.240 --> 15:19.000
are going to try to make their money off of services.

15:19.000 --> 15:25.000
And the thing is, that's something that Microsoft has wanted for a very, very, very long time.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.360
Microsoft has been begging the market to go to services.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.200
And so they're totally ready for this.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.600
They're totally fired up and ready to go.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.760
And I think this is a trend that's probably going to last 10 years.

15:37.760 --> 15:46.720
So I agree, we have to remain vigilant, but we have to remain vigilant for all commercial

15:46.720 --> 15:51.040
companies that are contributing to free software.

15:51.040 --> 15:55.720
Because they're all contributing to further their own interests.

15:55.720 --> 15:58.040
Microsoft is just one of the larger ones now.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.160
Oh, yeah, definitely.

15:59.160 --> 16:04.120
We should keep an eye on all of those companies, including Canonical, who've had a pretty

16:04.120 --> 16:06.240
good year, I would say.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.800
The release of 1804 stands out.

16:08.800 --> 16:12.520
That's the first LTS that they've released with Canonical on the desktop.

16:12.520 --> 16:16.200
And Shuttleworth has said that it's going to be supported for 10 years.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.480
And he's talking about doing an IPO in 2019.

16:19.480 --> 16:22.080
Things seem to be lining up pretty well for Canonical.

16:22.080 --> 16:28.720
Not just well, I would say a near perfect public execution.

16:28.720 --> 16:31.040
1804 was good.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.240
It was really good.

16:32.240 --> 16:37.120
And we've gotten some really solid derivatives based off of 1804.

16:37.120 --> 16:41.240
Some of the best derivatives I think we've ever seen of Ubuntu are based off of 1804

16:41.240 --> 16:42.240
right now.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.800
Very, very good.

16:43.800 --> 16:48.200
But this is also now the pivot of the company.

16:48.200 --> 16:51.320
They really ate the shit sandwich in 2017.

16:51.320 --> 16:56.480
And 2018 was Canonical really firing on all cylinders.

16:56.480 --> 17:00.280
1804, I think, was one of their best releases in history.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.720
1810 is a very solid mid-release.

17:02.720 --> 17:10.440
Snaps, which have been a company focus, have had a very, very good year.

17:10.440 --> 17:16.800
And Canonical has been part of that big Kubernetes conversation, which everyone's having towards

17:16.800 --> 17:18.560
the end of 2018.

17:18.560 --> 17:23.760
So they're doing really good right now, at least publicly on all the areas they're trying

17:23.760 --> 17:25.080
to give attention to.

17:25.080 --> 17:27.520
2019 is really theirs to lose.

17:27.520 --> 17:28.520
Definitely.

17:28.520 --> 17:33.520
Thinking about Snaps, Firefox and Chromium are the obvious huge examples.

17:33.520 --> 17:37.960
But they've had a lot of proprietary commercial software as well, which some people aren't

17:37.960 --> 17:38.960
happy with.

17:38.960 --> 17:43.440
But realistically, if you want to press forward as a platform, you're going to need.

17:43.440 --> 17:49.240
And it feels like they are gathering some momentum now so that they can go to the likes

17:49.240 --> 17:54.280
of Adobe to get some of that software running on Linux.

17:54.280 --> 17:59.340
And I think that you're right, it is theirs to lose next year.

17:59.340 --> 18:05.100
They really need to double down on the Kubernetes and server and container stuff, as well as

18:05.100 --> 18:06.100
the desktop.

18:06.100 --> 18:09.600
And they could be in a really strong position this time next year.

18:09.600 --> 18:14.480
They could be preparing for an IPO, the IPO may have happened, they might have been sold.

18:14.480 --> 18:18.040
But either way, they could be in a really strong position.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.040
I hope so.

18:19.040 --> 18:22.200
I don't know why, but part of me wonders if they were an American company, perhaps there

18:22.200 --> 18:24.140
would be more buzz right now.

18:24.140 --> 18:28.840
Because if you look at their sheer market dominance with virtual servers and containers

18:28.840 --> 18:35.480
and Internet of Things devices, they're beating Red Hat in a lot of really important categories.

18:35.480 --> 18:39.960
But yet we talk about Ubuntu like it's some desktop operating system.

18:39.960 --> 18:43.280
It's just simply not getting the respect it deserves in 2018.

18:43.280 --> 18:45.280
I hope 2019 changes that.

18:45.280 --> 18:50.560
Yeah, but they don't have the market share when it comes to the boring, not exciting

18:50.560 --> 18:52.580
stuff that Red Hat does.

18:52.580 --> 18:57.800
Red Hat is making all of that revenue from mostly quite boring installations that are

18:57.800 --> 19:01.320
just running infrastructure that we don't tend to think about.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.300
I mean, yes, you are absolutely right.

19:03.300 --> 19:10.520
But I think Ubuntu and its different older releases have a fair share of that same exact

19:10.520 --> 19:11.660
workload.

19:11.660 --> 19:13.860
It just doesn't get the credit it deserves.

19:13.860 --> 19:18.240
And I grant you, it's been a while since I have been going to clients and fixing their

19:18.240 --> 19:19.400
boxes.

19:19.400 --> 19:26.320
But there were absolutely conversations I had about solving issues with CentOS by moving

19:26.320 --> 19:27.320
to Ubuntu.

19:27.320 --> 19:33.580
And I look at the market dynamics and I look at the stats of people that download our shows

19:33.580 --> 19:35.200
and that email us.

19:35.200 --> 19:41.560
And it just, to me, seems like there is a real phenomenon happening here that the market

19:41.560 --> 19:43.680
hasn't fully realized.

19:43.680 --> 19:48.120
I could be wrong because there's so many on-premises business applications where CentOS or Red

19:48.120 --> 19:53.480
Hat Enterprise just really, really is the perfect tool for the job.

19:53.480 --> 19:58.120
But from my anecdotal experience over the last few years, I feel like Ubuntu is one

19:58.120 --> 20:05.880
of the biggest rising technologies that isn't getting the full, like it's just, the conversation

20:05.880 --> 20:08.840
doesn't fully represent the growth it's seen.

20:08.840 --> 20:09.840
Well, yeah.

20:09.840 --> 20:17.160
And Canonical seems more agile than Red Hat because they are smaller and younger and thirstier,

20:17.160 --> 20:18.840
hungrier.

20:18.840 --> 20:20.120
Not owned by IBM.

20:20.120 --> 20:21.380
Well, yeah.

20:21.380 --> 20:27.800
But you can't beat that entrenched market share and name you know.

20:27.800 --> 20:33.360
It's something that management are never going to fire you for, for going with Red Hat, whereas

20:33.360 --> 20:35.160
with Ubuntu, it's a bit more of a risk.

20:35.160 --> 20:42.120
So I think you've got an interesting dynamic building there between this sort of new innovative

20:42.120 --> 20:45.280
Ubuntu and the old school, solid Red Hat.

20:45.280 --> 20:50.240
When you're really talking about this market, too, you got to think about the whole lifecycle.

20:50.240 --> 20:53.400
It really starts at the student level.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.000
It starts with what is the student learning about?

20:56.000 --> 20:57.600
What are they getting certified in?

20:57.600 --> 21:01.760
What are they going to try to find courses in?

21:01.760 --> 21:07.440
And then that drives different courses, like that drives different educational institutions

21:07.440 --> 21:09.040
to build courseware there.

21:09.040 --> 21:11.960
And it sort of creates an ecosystem.

21:11.960 --> 21:18.680
And so Ubuntu has to find a place in that ecosystem, because there are a lot of different

21:18.680 --> 21:23.640
places where you can become Red Hat certified, you can become AWS certified.

21:23.640 --> 21:30.380
But an Ubuntu certification or a canonical server or IoT device certification isn't really

21:30.380 --> 21:32.220
a thing.

21:32.220 --> 21:37.060
And that plays a part too, and it kind of creates demand in itself.

21:37.060 --> 21:42.600
And of course, you don't really see people running RHEL or CentOS on their laptop, generally,

21:42.600 --> 21:43.600
do you?

21:43.600 --> 21:44.600
Maybe not.

21:44.600 --> 21:45.600
You see tons of Ubuntu.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.600
Maybe some Fedora.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.800
Yeah, true.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.480
You do see Fedora, but that's not quite the same thing, is it?

21:50.480 --> 21:56.140
It's very similar, whereas the beauty of Ubuntu, the strength that they have is it is the same

21:56.140 --> 22:02.120
operating system, whether it's on a laptop or a server.

22:02.120 --> 22:06.400
It's just the same thing, whether it's deployed on thousands of machines or just one person

22:06.400 --> 22:09.000
downloading it, installing it on an old laptop.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.000
Right.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.760
And if you're paying or not, you're going to get five years of support.

22:12.760 --> 22:13.760
Yeah, exactly.

22:13.760 --> 22:19.360
So it will be very interesting to see what happens this next year between Ubuntu and

22:19.360 --> 22:20.360
Red Hat.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.920
And we kind of look at this as a fight, but I don't think it is.

22:22.920 --> 22:25.960
I think there's enough market there for them both to do well.

22:25.960 --> 22:26.960
I agree.

22:26.960 --> 22:27.960
I think so too.

22:27.960 --> 22:32.740
I think there's plenty of market, and they both are, just by their very nature, serving

22:32.740 --> 22:33.740
different niches.

22:33.740 --> 22:38.200
Well, something that there seems to be an increasing market for is gaming on Linux.

22:38.200 --> 22:42.040
And this year has been a huge, huge year for gaming on Linux.

22:42.040 --> 22:43.760
I just can't believe it.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.160
I really can't believe it.

22:46.160 --> 22:52.160
All of a sudden, this gift of Proton landed on us, and it's changed everything.

22:52.160 --> 22:58.840
I've been playing so many great games on my machine that I just, I think the list right

22:58.840 --> 23:07.080
now is unofficially near 2,500 games that are supported via Proton, or also known as

23:07.080 --> 23:08.300
Steam Play.

23:08.300 --> 23:13.920
And for me, it's really meant that my desktop is now full of different game icons that I've

23:13.920 --> 23:16.440
just been waiting to play for so long.

23:16.440 --> 23:22.860
Yeah, by all accounts, this has really opened up gaming on Linux and made quite a few people

23:22.860 --> 23:27.160
able to ditch their Windows partition because there's just so many games available now.

23:27.160 --> 23:31.200
Not all of them, of course, some of the AAA titles, or a lot of the AAA titles are not

23:31.200 --> 23:32.200
available.

23:32.200 --> 23:38.760
But it's been a kind of weird year from Valve because they've pretty much given up on hardware,

23:38.760 --> 23:40.580
or at least that's the way it feels.

23:40.580 --> 23:44.900
But then they've also invested all this money into making the games work on Linux.

23:44.900 --> 23:50.220
And that makes you think maybe they might have another go at the hardware situation

23:50.220 --> 23:52.120
with the Steam machines next year.

23:52.120 --> 23:53.120
I don't know.

23:53.120 --> 23:56.720
And then you got to remember the whole thing with the Steam links, too.

23:56.720 --> 24:04.360
I expected by this time in 2018, we'd be talking about the Steam link 4K, or whatever it would

24:04.360 --> 24:10.000
be called, 60 frames per second 4K Steam link streaming from your desktop PC.

24:10.000 --> 24:15.760
And instead, Valve just killed the whole product line and just decided to do the app model,

24:15.760 --> 24:19.000
which is not what I saw coming at all.

24:19.000 --> 24:25.460
However, having a couple of months now to marinate on this particular change, it does

24:25.460 --> 24:28.040
seem to be the better choice.

24:28.040 --> 24:32.360
And it kind of seems obvious now in retrospect.

24:32.360 --> 24:35.240
But it has been a year that I didn't expect.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.640
I thought we'd have a couple of Steam machines.

24:37.640 --> 24:41.040
I thought we'd have a new generation of Steam link hardware.

24:41.040 --> 24:45.480
I thought we'd have games shipping on Windows and Linux at the same exact time thanks to

24:45.480 --> 24:47.760
Vulkan.

24:47.760 --> 24:50.840
And it's been some of that.

24:50.840 --> 24:55.320
And some of that's come in different forms that I didn't expect thanks to Proton.

24:55.320 --> 25:00.800
But it hasn't really been nearly what I thought it would be.

25:00.800 --> 25:05.200
And I guess that's just how it goes sometimes.

25:05.200 --> 25:11.720
You kind of have your expectations, you observe the results, and then you reset those expectations.

25:11.720 --> 25:19.120
And then you come to the uncomfortable understanding that everything happens on Valve time when

25:19.120 --> 25:22.280
it comes to anything that Valve makes.

25:22.280 --> 25:27.720
And maybe it's a case that they felt a bit burnt from making hardware and selling hardware

25:27.720 --> 25:33.340
because there's so much that goes into that with the certifications and all the prototyping

25:33.340 --> 25:34.480
process and everything.

25:34.480 --> 25:38.400
And don't forget that if you have hardware, you also then have to work on the software.

25:38.400 --> 25:41.840
Whereas if you just get rid of the hardware and say, here's an Android app, or here's

25:41.840 --> 25:46.960
an app that works on the Raspberry Pi, someone else is taking care of all the hardware for

25:46.960 --> 25:47.960
you.

25:47.960 --> 25:52.560
It's a whole business model of this is our Steam store, it's running on hardware that

25:52.560 --> 25:56.120
you have put together yourself, this is your gaming PC.

25:56.120 --> 26:01.720
So if they just concentrate on the software, then it's probably much less of a headache

26:01.720 --> 26:04.120
for them and ultimately much more profitable.

26:04.120 --> 26:08.820
Well, of course, all of that is well and good unless your kernel performs like crap, thanks

26:08.820 --> 26:10.120
to Meltdown Inspector.

26:10.120 --> 26:13.480
Yeah, technically this was kind of end of last year, wasn't it?

26:13.480 --> 26:17.440
But really, it's echoed throughout the entire year.

26:17.440 --> 26:22.240
But from a personal perspective, it hasn't really changed that much for me.

26:22.240 --> 26:27.560
I've not really noticed a slowdown on any of my hardware and servers that I look after

26:27.560 --> 26:33.400
don't have the kind of workloads that are really affected by the Spectrum Meltdown mitigations.

26:33.400 --> 26:39.920
So really, it's been a bit of a storm in a teacup for me, but I know that certain workloads

26:39.920 --> 26:45.800
it has really affected and it's driven up the cost of computing for a lot of people.

26:45.800 --> 26:51.040
That actually would be really interesting to know linuxactionnews.com slash contact

26:51.040 --> 26:53.280
has this impacted your workload?

26:53.280 --> 26:59.860
I mean, we know theoretically if it's a disk network and CPU intensive workload, you're

26:59.860 --> 27:02.480
more likely to be impacted by this.

27:02.480 --> 27:08.960
But I have to say, it seems like the kernel team has done a really, really clever job

27:08.960 --> 27:11.140
of striking a balance here.

27:11.140 --> 27:15.220
And that's one of the things that has been one of Linus's big focus points since he's

27:15.220 --> 27:20.720
been back is really making sure that we do this in a smart way.

27:20.720 --> 27:24.880
In fact, one of the one of the biggest mitigations that just been submitted to the kernel is

27:24.880 --> 27:29.760
an opt in where processes can choose to have protection instead of having protection by

27:29.760 --> 27:33.300
default with a significant performance penalty.

27:33.300 --> 27:38.880
You can say, you know, I'm one of those processes that's it's a snowflake.

27:38.880 --> 27:40.080
I am a unicorn.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.400
I am very important.

27:41.400 --> 27:45.540
I need the meltdown specter protection.

27:45.540 --> 27:47.520
And I opt for that.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.800
And I will eat that performance impact for that.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.320
And then the kernel says, all right, okay, very good.

27:53.320 --> 27:54.680
I will protect you.

27:54.680 --> 28:00.720
But otherwise, your applications are unimpacted by the performance penalties of these different

28:00.720 --> 28:01.720
mitigations.

28:01.720 --> 28:04.520
And that's a pretty smart way, I think, to handle this.

28:04.520 --> 28:09.280
Well, yeah, if you've got a load of machines that are behind firewalls and stuff and only

28:09.280 --> 28:15.980
on your internal network, then you don't really need to bother with these mitigations.

28:15.980 --> 28:18.920
The risk isn't really that bad.

28:18.920 --> 28:22.160
Whereas if you've got public facing web servers and stuff, then obviously, you do need to

28:22.160 --> 28:23.160
do that.

28:23.160 --> 28:26.000
And so it is good, I think that we've got this choice now.

28:26.000 --> 28:30.280
And it was a very sensible approach, and a very clever solution to it.

28:30.280 --> 28:34.320
But we can't talk about the kernel without the code of conduct and Linus leaving for

28:34.320 --> 28:35.680
a while and coming back.

28:35.680 --> 28:40.160
There was a lot said about this at the time.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.680
But nothing's really changed since then, has it?

28:42.680 --> 28:46.200
Well, we've gotten a more behaved Linus Torvalds.

28:46.200 --> 28:51.080
I actually think this was handled in a masterful way.

28:51.080 --> 28:54.280
Let's recap, just because it's the end of the year, and that's what we're doing right

28:54.280 --> 28:55.280
now.

28:55.280 --> 29:00.880
It starts with a rather aggressive article that was about to be published in The New

29:00.880 --> 29:01.960
Yorker.

29:01.960 --> 29:06.360
They reached out to contact Linus to get his input on it.

29:06.360 --> 29:11.240
And he was then alerted to what was about to be a shitstorm coming his way.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.880
He decided to take some time off.

29:13.880 --> 29:18.560
They applied a rather rushed code of conduct to the kernel.

29:18.560 --> 29:21.440
And he took his break, code of conduct went live.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.340
The entire internet freaked out.

29:23.340 --> 29:26.380
The New Yorker piece ran.

29:26.380 --> 29:27.500
Time went by.

29:27.500 --> 29:33.040
They modified that code of conduct to be a little more amicable for people involved.

29:33.040 --> 29:37.880
Linus came back, and he seems to have toned down his interactions.

29:37.880 --> 29:43.240
And I think he very tactfully avoided a huge shitstorm that was coming his way.

29:43.240 --> 29:49.500
And business is now continuing on like nothing happened, with Linus that swears a bit less.

29:49.500 --> 29:53.260
And I think in some ways, this was the ideal scenario.

29:53.260 --> 29:58.960
Because now we have the ground rules for participating in the kernel that everybody understands.

29:58.960 --> 30:04.680
And we still have the original visionary that started the project involved directing the

30:04.680 --> 30:05.680
project.

30:05.680 --> 30:10.040
This to me seems like the absolute best case scenario that we could have gotten.

30:10.040 --> 30:14.480
You look at all of the different political situations that have happened in the same

30:14.480 --> 30:17.520
general flavor over 2018.

30:17.520 --> 30:20.440
And I think Linus navigated it perhaps the best.

30:20.440 --> 30:21.680
Yeah, I agree.

30:21.680 --> 30:26.920
I was worried for a while that this was going to make serious changes, and maybe even the

30:26.920 --> 30:28.640
most serious change that he would go.

30:28.640 --> 30:31.320
You wanted to have a bet that he wasn't going to come back.

30:31.320 --> 30:32.320
Yeah.

30:32.320 --> 30:33.320
Yeah.

30:33.320 --> 30:34.320
I was seriously worried about that.

30:34.320 --> 30:39.660
But it seems to have all blown over, and it is just business as usual.

30:39.660 --> 30:45.000
Whether or not there are tensions simmering below the surface that will kind of bubble

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
over.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.480
That's almost guaranteed.

30:47.480 --> 30:48.480
Yeah.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.480
Yeah.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.880
I think we're going to see some more of this next year, but I really hope not.

30:51.880 --> 30:57.640
I really hope that they just stick to writing great code and making the kernel be the best

30:57.640 --> 30:58.640
that it possibly can be.

30:58.640 --> 31:01.160
But I think we're going to have to see on that one.

31:01.160 --> 31:06.680
Well, we can't go any farther with an end of year review without talking about Chrome

31:06.680 --> 31:07.680
OS.

31:07.680 --> 31:08.680
Yeah.

31:08.680 --> 31:13.360
This was the year that Chrome OS went from being a web browser to being a full fledged

31:13.360 --> 31:16.920
operating system, or at least took some massive steps towards that.

31:16.920 --> 31:20.960
Not only did we get a Chrome OS tablet this year, but the bigger deal really was that

31:20.960 --> 31:23.960
whole being able to run Linux apps on Chrome.

31:23.960 --> 31:30.400
You got the user land, of course, but the GUI apps, like the X11 apps from Linux now

31:30.400 --> 31:32.520
on Chrome OS.

31:32.520 --> 31:37.720
And on top of those application level things, they also made improvements like around Chrome

31:37.720 --> 31:43.460
OS 70 to bring native file support to Chrome OS so you could browse Samba shares.

31:43.460 --> 31:46.800
It's really becoming a full fledged development environment.

31:46.800 --> 31:52.600
Google went from a web browser for your desktop to a development environment to create web

31:52.600 --> 31:59.440
applications and they're empowering that with access to Linux and Linux applications.

31:59.440 --> 32:04.480
But the big question is, is this going to be enough to sell these machines running Chrome

32:04.480 --> 32:09.120
OS to serious professionals, be they developers or something else?

32:09.120 --> 32:12.160
And let me ask you a question.

32:12.160 --> 32:15.400
You bought a laptop this year, a very nice ThinkPad.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.480
Did you consider buying a Chromebook for one second?

32:18.480 --> 32:20.560
No, not for the ThinkPad.

32:20.560 --> 32:21.560
I have since then.

32:21.560 --> 32:26.760
I got the ThinkPad to record podcasts, but I have thought about a Chromebook since then

32:26.760 --> 32:31.960
for email and Google apps and things like that, because now as part of Linux Academy

32:31.960 --> 32:38.100
we're using Google apps and Jupiter Broadcasting uses Google apps and a lot of places use Google

32:38.100 --> 32:43.080
apps and maybe a Chromebook would be a perfect machine for that.

32:43.080 --> 32:49.040
But more than that, I think Chrome OS started the year as a web browser OS and I think it's

32:49.040 --> 32:52.960
ending the year as a workstation OS.

32:52.960 --> 32:57.780
And that is no small transition to make in one year.

32:57.780 --> 33:02.560
And it's not applicable to all of us, but it's pretty remarkable that it's applicable

33:02.560 --> 33:04.520
to some of us.

33:04.520 --> 33:07.520
That's a massive transition they're going to make and continue to make.

33:07.520 --> 33:12.000
And then you look at it with like Samsung decks and other things in this general area

33:12.000 --> 33:16.680
and Microsoft with the Windows subsystem for Linux, something's happening here.

33:16.680 --> 33:21.200
Well, that something is companies waking up to the power of Linux.

33:21.200 --> 33:26.320
And by Linux, I mean, proper Linux, not Android or Chrome OS as we used to know it, be it

33:26.320 --> 33:30.600
desktop or server, you know, proper GNU slash Linux.

33:30.600 --> 33:35.180
These companies are realizing, hang on, this is actually pretty good and maybe we should

33:35.180 --> 33:36.520
do something with it.

33:36.520 --> 33:40.280
It's not that hard to actually just ship things people want.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.280
Hold on a second.

33:42.280 --> 33:46.320
I mean, really, that's what we're seeing, like Samsung and Google are just now figuring

33:46.320 --> 33:47.320
that out.

33:47.320 --> 33:48.320
Hello.

33:48.320 --> 33:53.480
Hello, everybody, and welcome to the reality of what Linux users want.

33:53.480 --> 34:00.000
And Chrome OS and Windows and Samsung and others, I recently had an interview with the

34:00.000 --> 34:07.280
developer of ISH, I-S-H, which is an entire Linux environment for iOS.

34:07.280 --> 34:12.320
All the major platforms right now are offering Linux in some form or another, and it turns

34:12.320 --> 34:16.160
out the best Linux experience is when you run Linux.

34:16.160 --> 34:18.640
Yeah, surprise, surprise.

34:18.640 --> 34:23.720
Well, you said it was Canonical's year to lose, but really it's Linux's year to lose.

34:23.720 --> 34:25.920
But I do not see that happening.

34:25.920 --> 34:26.920
Well, we'll see.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.000
I have a few predictions.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.360
I think you have a few predictions.

34:30.360 --> 34:34.600
Let's just maybe wait and see where things are going to go in 2019.

34:34.600 --> 34:39.960
Don't miss a single episode of Linux Action News because we cover it as it unfolds every

34:39.960 --> 34:40.960
single week.

34:40.960 --> 34:45.400
Go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes, including

34:45.400 --> 34:50.520
next week's episode, which is my predictions and Joe's predictions for 2019.

34:50.520 --> 34:54.080
Yeah, and a look back at our previous predictions.

34:54.080 --> 34:58.440
Will I be editing out the Bitcoin stuff or will we have to just face the music on that?

34:58.440 --> 35:00.080
Oh, we'll see.

35:00.080 --> 35:02.640
I think that's painful, Joe.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.800
We have to wait and see.

35:04.800 --> 35:09.640
Yeah, you can go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

35:09.640 --> 35:17.440
And please do join us at Linux Fest Northwest, April 26th through the 28th, 2019 at the Bellingham

35:17.440 --> 35:19.520
Washington Technical College.

35:19.520 --> 35:25.880
We'll be doing the first live Linux Action News on location, and we'd love to have you

35:25.880 --> 35:26.880
there.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.920
Yeah, I'm not at all nervous about doing a live show in front of people during the day,

35:29.920 --> 35:30.920
not drinking or anything.

35:30.920 --> 35:31.920
No, it'll be fine.

35:31.920 --> 35:32.920
Don't worry.

35:32.920 --> 35:33.920
It'll be great.

35:33.920 --> 35:34.920
Yeah, of course.

35:34.920 --> 35:38.600
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.880
I am at Chris LAS.

35:40.880 --> 35:42.520
I'm at Joe Ressington.

35:42.520 --> 35:43.760
Thank you for joining us.

35:43.760 --> 35:46.320
Happy holidays, and we will see you next week.

35:46.320 --> 36:04.720
Take care, bye for now.
