00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,080
Episode 211, recorded on October 17th, 2021.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,080
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,080
And I'm Wes.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,080
Hello, Wes.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,080
Let's do the news.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,200
With the release of Plasma 5.23 this week, the KDE community is celebrating its 25th

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,200
birthday.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:29,000
On October 14th, 1996, Matthias Ettrick announced a new project, the Cool Desktop Environment.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,160
KDE was launched with a goal, a bold goal to make a desktop for end users and maybe

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,760
even standardize the Linux desktop somewhat.

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,440
So picture it, it was a long time ago back in 96 when KDE launched, a Linux user at the

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,800
time would need to cobble together maybe a dozen different toolkits and widget sets to

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,480
get all of the various desktop applications, quote unquote applications they needed back

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,720
in the day.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,000
We kind of take it for granted now, because in many ways, they've been successful.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,500
We essentially have a predominantly GTK and Qt app ecosystem on the Linux desktop.

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,120
That's a lot better than a dozen.

19
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,680
And now 25 years later, KDE Plasma 5.23 looks like something of a special release.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,960
As with every recent release, 5.23 sees much improved Wayland support and gesture support

21
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,240
and improved compatibility between Wayland and ExWayland applications.

22
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,200
And Chris, I know you'll be happy to see this land multiscreen layouts are now retained

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,720
across X11 and Wayland sessions.

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,960
I'm allowed to do a happy dance over this one, right, Wes?

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,600
I think so.

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
This is amazing.

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,680
I'm doing a happy dance right now, if you can't tell.

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,680
I mean, I legitimately had just written this off as a thing.

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,640
I figured one of the costs as an end user that was living on the Linux desktop through

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,920
the X11 to Wayland transition was that I just wouldn't have ideally preserved window arrangement

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,080
layout saved when I switched display servers.

32
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,080
I just I'd come to accept that it was a fact of Linux desktop life.

33
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,880
And somehow these crazy Plasma devs have actually solved that problem.

34
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,520
In my opinion, that's so huge because it's just a feature I never thought we were going

35
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,520
to see.

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,080
And they delivered it in this edition.

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,080
I also know that they just put a gigantic amount of effort into things like the kickoff

38
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,000
application launcher and into their application installer, KDE Discover.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,880
It's great to see those applications get some work.

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
Indeed.

41
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,600
And all that is, of course, among a wide variety of other improvements and fixes throughout

42
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Plasma.

43
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,240
This is a version of Plasma you could move into for a while.

44
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,240
Oh, definitely.

45
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,600
You know, I've gotten a little bit of hands on this weekend with the new release.

46
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,520
So this is just early impressions from me.

47
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,320
And I generally they evolve over time and whatnot.

48
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,880
But you know, the one thing that's an obvious trend here is that Plasma has been in a real

49
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,920
refinement period for for a little bit now.

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,320
And every release has noticeably and quantifiably improved the user experience in sometimes

51
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,080
small ways and in sometimes large ways.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,440
And it's been on that trajectory now for a while.

53
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,920
Plasma 5.23 doubles down on that trajectory.

54
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,620
And on that front, I have to say the new blue ocean breeze theme has brought me back to

55
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,840
using a light theme on Plasma.

56
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,720
It just does a better job of drawing my eyes to the active elements in the window.

57
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,280
And it honestly just has a really professional finished feel to it.

58
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,800
And I like the new ability to easily tweak the accent colors.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,460
You kind of do this in Plasma before, but they've made it way easier now.

60
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,080
And those kickoff improvements I mentioned, well, they're welcomed by me.

61
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,880
I mean, it's it was needed.

62
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,280
I think it needed some TLC.

63
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,240
Those improvements were necessary.

64
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,280
And they've just knocked him out of the park.

65
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,840
They've done a great job.

66
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,880
For those of you not familiar, the kickoff menu is like the start menu, if you will,

67
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,880
for the Plasma desktop.

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,160
And so you want that to be well refined.

69
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,360
You want it to look really solid.

70
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,920
It's one of the very first things a new user interacts with.

71
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,600
And it's one of the things a longtime user will use thousands of times.

72
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,640
So these improvements matter a lot.

73
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,140
And they nailed it with this release.

74
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,180
It just looks better.

75
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,320
It works better.

76
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:08,280
And I'd expect Microsoft to rip this off for Windows 12.

77
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,720
The Blender project announced Apple has joined their development fund, apparently in the

78
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
works for some time.

79
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,400
But this week, the project made the investment public.

80
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Yeah.

81
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,480
And along with the news about money, there was also some news about code.

82
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,760
The first official patch to Blender was submitted by Apple.

83
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,800
And surprise, surprise, it's a metal back end for GPU rendering on Mac OS.

84
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,080
But according to the announcement, Apple will also provide ongoing engineering expertise

85
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,200
and additional resources to Blender and its broader development community as well.

86
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,760
Yeah, this kind of investment seems to be a win win for everyone.

87
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,400
I mean, an important project gets critical funding.

88
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,440
And Apple gets support for Mac OS and gives developers incentive to keep that support

89
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,240
first rate.

90
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,760
Blender said its development fund accepts donations to quote, support activities to

91
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,080
provide free and open accessible services for all Blender contributors, including bug

92
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,520
fixing, code reviews, technical documentation, and onboarding.

93
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,600
This seems like big news for you Mac OS users out there.

94
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,760
More doors are going to open.

95
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,480
This will have broader impacts than just Blender for free software that supports GPU rendering

96
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,080
on Apple's SoC.

97
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,160
And let's not forget with Blender seeing more comprehensive and broader adoption, all three

98
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,040
major desktop platforms will have a compatible open source 3D graphics tool.

99
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,160
Igor Tseletsky, the CEO of Cloud Linux and the founder of Alma Linux has announced he

100
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,960
is stepping down from the Alma Linux OS foundation board.

101
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,400
2021 has been something of a bootstrapping year for the new CentOS alternatives that

102
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
have popped up.

103
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,840
Alma Linux was spun out from Cloud Linux shortly after the CentOS stream transition announcement

104
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,460
back in December of 2020.

105
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,080
We asked Igor if it was his intention from the start to step down eventually, or if this

106
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,420
was in response to some event.

107
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,880
He told us, quote, the intention from the start was to make it a well-governed and independent

108
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,520
organization that will survive the test of time.

109
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,680
Knowing the history of CentOS, which never had any org structure behind it, I knew the

110
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,440
governance will be very important.

111
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,920
I didn't know which form it will take, but it was always the goal.

112
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,480
Igor went on to say that there was no intention for him to be on the board in the first place.

113
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,760
In fact, he says, quote, it was more of a necessity.

114
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,040
Someone had to do it.

115
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,680
Someone had to drive the process forward, invite people, talk to lawyers, figure out

116
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,800
the next steps.

117
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:41,760
He finishes by saying, you would be surprised just how few people want that responsibility.

118
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:47,280
At the end of March, the Alma Linux Foundation was formed to manage the trademarks and, in

119
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,280
the words of its bylaws, to, quote, develop and maintain a no-registration, ad-free, stable,

120
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,480
open-source Linux distribution.

121
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,120
Igor told us, quote, I don't have a sentiment that Alma Linux is mine.

122
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,600
It is not.

123
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,200
I helped to start it, and I will continue helping it flourish.

124
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,120
Yet I will not be done giving it direction.

125
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,280
That is the whole point of it being a community-owned organization.

126
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,880
It should be the community that decides what is next, what is OK, and what is acceptable.

127
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,600
Here, here, I think to really appreciate how big of a deal this is, especially if you're

128
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:32,200
not a CentOS user, you have to consider how critical the server market is to Linux and

129
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:38,600
how important it is to have a free, enterprise-grade, community-run distribution that actually has

130
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,500
broad vendor support.

131
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,560
It's absolutely vital.

132
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,920
I think it's a key part of the Linux server ecosystem.

133
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:51,120
But it's not just that context, which is already super important, but it's also an important

134
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,640
historical milestone for long-term CentOS users.

135
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,700
Because at the core of the issues that plagued CentOS in the past, like the pre-Red Hat days,

136
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:05,920
it was always the knock-on effects of its original ownership structure, if we'll just

137
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:12,480
call it that loosely, and the problems that resulted in losing one of its original founders

138
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,260
who had access to the PayPal account, who had access to the website, had trademarks.

139
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,240
It just plagued the project.

140
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,080
Yeah, and I think that's the lens with which we should be observing this news.

141
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,840
Stepping down from a board like this is a notable move on its own.

142
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,840
But for the CentOS community, this is significant.

143
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,920
And it's sort of a signal that business continues as normal.

144
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,760
Alma Linux shipped their 8.5 beta shortly after this news dropped, and just six days

145
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,300
after Red Hat Enterprise 8.5's beta shipped.

146
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,880
That's been a trend, and it's something CentOS users notice.

147
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Linode.com slash LAN.

148
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,280
You go there to get $100 in 6-day credit on a new account, and you go there to support

149
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,880
this here show.

150
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,720
Linode is where we host the services that you use whenever you're downloading a podcast

151
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,680
or interacting with us on a regular basis.

152
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,360
And one of our secret sauces has really been their object storage.

153
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,680
I normally would sit here and tell you about how fast their machines are, and how they

154
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,480
have 11 data centers, and NVMe upgraded disks in their systems, and AMD EPYC processors

155
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,160
for their high-end CPU boxes.

156
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:27,440
But honestly, I'm finding new uses for object storage all the time.

157
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,960
And in the show notes, I'll put a link to a guide that Linode has released to use Plex

158
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,240
with object storage.

159
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,360
You see where I'm going with that?

160
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,040
That could be fire right there.

161
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,560
And when you go to Linode.com slash LAN, you get $100 to work with here.

162
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,640
So you can really try them out.

163
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,840
You can go build a system, go deploy your own Jitsi box or something like that, and

164
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,240
really get a sense of how fast the boxes are and how clean the dashboard is.

165
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,040
And then if you ever need help, they've got the best customer support in the business.

166
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,700
People that are really going to help you 24-7 by phone, by ticket, or by social.

167
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,640
And they're often advancing into new areas as well, like bare metal servers is something

168
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,160
they're rolling out, DDoS protection, cloud firewalls, these kinds of things that are

169
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,000
just super nice to have and make working with Linode even faster.

170
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,480
I really appreciate they have image templates, they have stack scripts, and their one click

171
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,880
deployments make it super easy to get started with like a base system that you can build

172
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,200
on top of really quick.

173
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,560
But let's be honest, one of the best things is their pricing.

174
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,440
They're 30 to 50% cheaper than other major cloud providers.

175
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
That's pretty nice.

176
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,920
When you look at the performance, the price, and the fact that you get to support your

177
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,960
local friendly Linux action news, that's a pretty nice combination.

178
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,320
And then if you get into more advanced stuff, like you need Terraform or Kubernetes support,

179
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,080
well, they got that too.

180
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,080
They got Kubernetes for days.

181
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,240
I mean, Wes is always going on about the Kubernetes, the Kubernetes, and Linode's got that.

182
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,000
Go check it out for yourself though, and take advantage of that $100 and support the show.

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,360
Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing.

184
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,200
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

185
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,900
So sign up today, linode.com slash LAN.

186
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:15,160
Linux.ting.com.

187
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,360
Boy am I grateful for mobile connectivity today.

188
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
What a day it is.

189
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,520
I'm sure you've had these too, where you've got work stuff and you got parent stuff.

190
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,560
Mobile connectivity is essential, and I am very grateful for Ting's flexibility.

191
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,700
You know, I've been a customer since 2013, and the reality is they've been flexible with

192
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,480
me the entire time.

193
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
Here I am today.

194
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,020
I'm more of a heavy user on data than I ever was, but in the past I fancied myself as someone

195
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:47,200
who was able to download my podcasts and sync my photos and get things prepared before I

196
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
left.

197
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,560
But these days I'm flying by the seat of my pants more and more, and Ting stayed flexible.

198
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,880
Their plans are simple and straightforward.

199
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
You just go to their website, you see them, they're easy.

200
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,320
Go to linux.ting.com though, because that'll take 25 bucks off.

201
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,560
You see, the name of the game here is that Ting's an MBNO.

202
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,600
That means that they get to focus on things like customer service and being competitive

203
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,200
in the marketplace, and they don't have to focus on digging holes in the ground like

204
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,360
the duopolies do, but they get to ride on top of their networks.

205
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,920
It's a pretty slick setup and it gives Ting the flexibility to do things like no contracts

206
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,360
and just fantastic pricing and the best customer support in the business.

207
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,000
So go to linux.ting.com to get started.

208
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,080
Fill in your information, Ting will give you a SIM card, they'll ship it to you, they'll

209
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,280
mail it to you, you know, that kind of thing.

210
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,520
You pop it in your phone and you get off and going in seconds because they've got a great

211
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
dashboard.

212
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,280
And if you ever need any help, they've got great customer support.

213
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,740
Join me on Ting, linux.ting.com.

214
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,480
Now I've got to get out of here.

215
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:50,040
On Thursday, October 14th, we saw the release of Ubuntu 21.10, an LTS interim release with

216
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,640
nine months of support and the first to use GNOME 40 for the desktop.

217
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:01,440
Chronicles release announcement focuses on developers and specifically Windows developers

218
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,600
saying quote, Windows developers will be delighted with out of the box support for graphical

219
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,840
applications on Windows subsystem for Linux, which enables users to enjoy Ubuntu desktop

220
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,940
applications without modification.

221
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,360
That does give you some indication of the focus of this release, it's developers.

222
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,800
Those of us who've been around for a while and have seen some of these releases, we know

223
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,800
how this works.

224
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,480
The LTS release gets many magnitudes more of users and likely the press coverage too

225
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,240
than these interim releases do.

226
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,800
But this is the land where Canonical traditionally plays.

227
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,800
It does interesting work, if not even risky work.

228
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Right.

229
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,780
You might recall it was way back in the Ubuntu 17.10 release cycle that Canonical tried switching

230
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:49,920
to Wayland by default before ultimately determining, no, that was too early, Wayland isn't ready

231
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,780
and walk that back in 1804.

232
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,940
That's a great example of where they use that interim release to really experiment.

233
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,260
And in comparison, I'm pretty underwhelmed with the release of Ubuntu 21.10.

234
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:04,760
And to be clear, this is why we save this for the end of the show this week.

235
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,500
This is really more of an opinion piece than it is news.

236
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:12,840
But having reviewed every release of Ubuntu ever personally, I'm left feeling like Canonical

237
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,120
has sort of stopped experimenting with these and the last release as well.

238
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,760
There's nothing that we're really trying here.

239
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,600
I mean, there's nothing incredibly new.

240
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,680
As things stand right now, I basically kind of have to look forward to the LTS for something

241
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,400
new.

242
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,720
And well, that's likely going to leave me disappointed, especially with Ubuntu now falling

243
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,640
behind on both GNOME and GTK.

244
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,240
They only just now started shipping pipeline.

245
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,120
It's not being used by default.

246
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,200
And it's unclear if they'll make the leap to GNOME 42 for their LTS, which will land

247
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,600
late in the 2204 cycle.

248
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:56,120
As for the kernel, Linux 5.13, it's definitely solid, but 5.14 has been out for a bit now.

249
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,440
And we're really starting to see some major important things land in these recent kernels.

250
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,240
Staying current right now seems to matter more than ever.

251
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,240
Which is why it's kind of a bit ironic that Canonical is positioning this release as one

252
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,160
for developers.

253
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,880
My thoughts as well.

254
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,160
It is great to see first class WSL support.

255
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,720
And I think it's a very clever move on Canonical's part.

256
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,480
And it seems like an investment they're making today that will have future returns.

257
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:31,160
But outside of WSL, what is the specific special sauce Ubuntu is offering developers right

258
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,160
now?

259
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,440
Is it their out of date GTK environment?

260
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,080
Their not so current kernel?

261
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,200
And what's the value for developers who are running the bulk of their applications in

262
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,400
containers?

263
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,800
It's getting harder and harder to answer that question these days.

264
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,840
And when I zoom out, and I look at the longer term trends around Ubuntu as a platform, it

265
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,080
seems like it might be coming less appealing to build on.

266
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,600
And let's take a look at the deck.

267
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,380
You kind of have to wonder, why didn't Valve go with Ubuntu on the deck?

268
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,760
After all, the compatibility environment they ship with Steam is, and always has been, I

269
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,720
should say, based on Ubuntu.

270
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,640
So wouldn't have just been more straightforward to expand upon that?

271
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,680
You got to imagine from a tooling and workflow standpoint, it would have been easier for

272
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,900
the development team just to build on that and make the entire device Ubuntu.

273
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:28,880
But instead, they rebased on Arch, which is no small effort.

274
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,320
Yeah, I mean, Valve's SteamOS developers had to make a choice here with Arch.

275
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:41,040
And one that they would know might mean having to retool and rethink how to build a distro.

276
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,380
Something had to motivate a change like that.

277
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,620
You have to wonder what was the missing pieces that made Ubuntu not a contender.

278
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,400
And it's likely fresher components and drivers and software.

279
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,440
And Valve's not the only developer in town that has those requirements.

280
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,240
They're left sort of just feeling like Ubuntu has taken their eye off this project a little

281
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,720
bit, like it's still got good staff from Canonical working on it.

282
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,320
But that top-down driver that's generally needed at Canonical, it's hard to say, but

283
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,480
it feels like it's missing these days.

284
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,200
And maybe it just doesn't have the same level of investment at the corporate level, especially

285
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,680
at the top level of the corporation that it used to.

286
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,820
Of course, Canonical will never come out and release a press release that says, we're not

287
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,120
quite as interested in the desktop anymore, right?

288
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,640
They're going to continue to make a product that their OEMs can use, but they're not going

289
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,640
to necessarily advertise that it's a minimum viable effort from a company standpoint.

290
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,780
But that's not to say we are not grateful to the developers who do hard work on the

291
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:40,400
Ubuntu desktop and make it what it is.

292
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,600
We are very thankful for everything you do.

293
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:50,040
And while these last two rounds of releases have been somewhat underwhelming, the LTS

294
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,100
is really the final game.

295
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,200
That's true.

296
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,320
And the flavors also have a lot to offer.

297
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,140
For our complete review and thoughts on those flavors and our other notes, go check out

298

299
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,720
And just a programming note for next week, the episode will be out just a little bit

300
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,320
later than usual.

301
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,960
Wes is off to a wedding, not his own, but he's attending a friend's wedding over the

302
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
weekend.

303
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,160
So we'll be out just a bit later.

304
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
