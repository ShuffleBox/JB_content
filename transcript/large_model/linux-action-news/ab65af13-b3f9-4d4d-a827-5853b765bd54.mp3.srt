00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,120
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:21,280
This is episode 103, recorded on April 28th, 2019.

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,280
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,280
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,360
Good to be in studio with you.

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,720
Happy Linux Fest Northwest weekend.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,760
Yeah, it's pretty strange to be actually looking at you while I'm doing this.

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,880
Well, it also means that we were running around barbecuing and festing a whole bunch.

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,920
But never fear, we still have some stories for you.

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,640
Let's kick things off with a big Docker Hub hack story.

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,760
It appears that a Docker Hub hack has exposed data of 190,000 Docker Hub users.

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,720
Yeah, this is kind of a breaking story.

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,880
We only really became aware of it on Friday evening.

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,000
So the details are a little bit sketchy at the moment.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,720
But whichever way you look at this, it does not look good for Docker.

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,440
The whole thing really came to light when Docker started emailing customers around April

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
25.

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,760
They wrote, on Thursday, April 25, 2019, we discovered an unauthorized access to a single

20
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,880
Docker Hub database storing a subset of non-financial user data.

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,760
That's according to the director of Docker support in the email.

22
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,440
But they did say the hacker had access to the database for only a short moment, which

23
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:31,920
meant about 190,000 users or around 5% of their entire user base for Docker Hub.

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,440
Now, if you are a Docker Hub user, there are some warnings that have been issued and some

25
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,440
steps you can take to somewhat mitigate this.

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,240
Yeah, that same director of support went on to say for users with auto builds that may

27
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,680
have been impacted, they've revoked the GitHub tokens and access keys.

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,040
And they're asking you to reconnect your repositories and check your security logs for like a GitHub

29
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,360
login to see if anything has been accessed.

30
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,420
You'll also have to reconnect the OAuth for automated builds and you'll have to roll over

31
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,340
affected passwords and API keys that were stored in private repos.

32
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:05,860
That's just good practice, not required, but it's something you probably need to do.

33
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,720
And of course, last but absolutely not least, change your password on Docker Hub.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,000
Now, there's been a lot of criticism online, obviously Reddit, they've been going crazy

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,060
about this.

36
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,340
And one particular thing that stood out to me was the lack of two-factor authentication

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,440
with Docker Hub, which is a feature that was requested four years ago and still hasn't

38
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
been implemented.

39
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,800
But it's not clear whether that would have actually helped in this situation.

40
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,080
There's some argument there.

41
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,780
I don't think it would have helped completely, but come on, it can't hurt to have two-factor

42
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,120
turned on.

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,660
Two-factor just is always a great idea.

44
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,600
In this particular case, if the attacker gets a database with hashed passwords, then they're

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,080
still going to have that data, which means they'll know what passwords you used.

46
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,760
And if you use that anywhere else or anything that might be exploitable because maybe the

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,760
two-factor system isn't perfect, it's just not a complete solution.

48
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,200
But you're right, this was requested 43 months ago, 43 months people have been asking for

49
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,920
two-factor authentication.

50
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
It'd be good.

51
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
It would be good.

52
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,200
I don't know if it necessarily would have changed much here.

53
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,240
You'd still want to go change your passwords and whatnot, but yeah, let's get that going

54
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,440
Docker Hub.

55
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,440
You know what?

56
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,960
If you're going to be at the enterprise level, that's something you need to do.

57
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,840
This is really not the Docker story that I expected to be talking about right now because

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,280
earlier in the week, they announced a new partnership with Arm.

59
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,760
Yeah, it's funny you say that because they're really excited about this.

60
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,080
I bet they are a little disappointed that this isn't the lead story and Arm is really

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,480
making a big stink out of this as well.

62
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,600
It's this new capability they're all excited about, which will work for applications that

63
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:41,680
are written in JavaScript or, you know, node, Python, Java, C++, Ruby,.NET Core, Go, Rust

64
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,600
and PHP.

65
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,180
Then next week, or the week that you listen to this, will be a tech preview that Docker

66
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,520
will host at its annual North American Developer Conference in San Francisco.

67
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,320
Elle will be there from our crew and there they will demonstrate the capability for developers

68
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:03,480
to build and assemble Docker image stacks on their laptop and then the applications

69
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,020
inside of which will be compiled and executable on Arm servers.

70
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:14,880
Think of like the Amazon A1 instances that are often cheaper than the x86 machines.

71
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,560
There's some immediate cost savings benefit there.

72
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,120
Now it's not all Arm processors.

73
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,500
This is an extension of the Arm Neoverse platform.

74
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,880
We've talked about that before, but these are the Arm chips that are targeted at the

75
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,800
data center, the enterprise.

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,720
And Arm's whole pitch here is, hey, look, now you've got a solution that goes from the

77
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,240
data center all the way to the IoT Edge device.

78
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,360
It's Arm all the way down and now you can manage those crazy IoT applications with containers.

79
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,680
That'll solve it all, containers.

80
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,400
And Docker is more than happy now with their new enterprise focus.

81
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,120
They just got done relining their business around enterprise.

82
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,960
What was it back in the end of February?

83
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,800
They laid off a bunch of people and really said, okay, now it's all about the enterprise.

84
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,200
Well, this is a manifestation of that.

85
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,040
And I guess it's not a horrible idea.

86
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,480
I just, as time has gone on, I've become more of a skeptic.

87
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,240
Remember when we covered that story where Linus really kind of broke down why he doesn't

88
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,000
think Arm and the data center is ever really going to make sense?

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,280
At least at the application level, he convinced me.

90
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
Linus is a smart man.

91
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,720
He knows what he's talking about.

92
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,280
And it's not that I don't see uses for Arm in the data center, because that'd be a stupid

93
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
thing to say.

94
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,720
They're already here today.

95
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,600
It's just I am not as personally thrilled by this idea.

96
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,520
I don't really foresee a future where enterprise grade applications can be created on one

97
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,320
platform built for a completely separate platform and then deployed without something not going

98
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
quite right.

99
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Well, that is true.

100
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,080
But they're trying to lower the barrier of entry here.

101
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,700
They're trying to take at least one of those problems away by making it trivial.

102
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:55,160
Because you could already do this with tools that are available for Linux.

103
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,080
But what they're doing is just packaging all that stuff together to make it super easy

104
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,000
for developers to not even have to think about it.

105
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,600
And yes, okay, the argument that Torval's made about testing on a different platform

106
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,240
and the problems that you're going to have does make sense.

107
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,560
But also, the bottom line makes a lot more sense.

108
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,080
And if you can deploy applications for significantly less cost on Arm-based machines, then companies

109
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,400
are just going to do that.

110
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,520
And they're just going to swallow the cost of the bugs that crop up.

111
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,000
And they're just going to have to work through that.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,280
Well, and I'll give it this.

113
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,160
If you're working with.NET Core and Ruby and Java and Python, you're going to have

114
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,640
probably a pretty good chance this is going to work fine.

115
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,040
And enabling developers to build on an x86 platform and then deploy on an Arm platform

116
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,880
is likely going to mean more use cases for Arm, more deployments of Arm when you reduce

117
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,260
one of those barriers.

118
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:50,280
So it's obviously clearly a good business idea.

119
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,840
I'm just, I guess, from an end user's perspective, not thrilled at what I'm likely going to be

120
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
consuming.

121
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,040
You know, like, this is probably going to be half-assed, overloaded, slow-bloated hardware

122
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,440
for a very long time until, at least at the edge devices, the hardware in there gets a

123
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
lot better.

124
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,600
I know I'm a skeptic of this kind of stuff.

125
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,680
I really should try to see more positive aspects of this.

126
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,880
But to me, it just seems like a perfect platform to shovel crap into a container and throw

127
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,920
it down on an underpowered Arm device.

128
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,760
Don't be so cynical.

129
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,520
That's my job, isn't it?

130
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,200
So something that we talked about on the Friday stream was something that surprised me, I

131
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,920
must say, that Apple reportedly spends more than $30 million a month on AWS.

132
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,140
I think there's a bigger metastore going on here, too, that is going to create a new level

133
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,360
of cloud lock-in.

134
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,600
So the report claims the amount Apple spent on AWS during the first quarter of 2019 is

135
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,200
up 10% over previous year.

136
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:56,880
If the current usage levels persist, then the firm will have spent a total of $360 million

137
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:00,440
on procuring services from Amazon this year alone.

138
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,740
It's also further claimed by the report, and there's a source in there that they're using

139
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:12,120
for this, that Apple has made a five-year commitment to spend at least, in quotes, $1.5

140
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,080
billion with AWS.

141
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,080
So this is the bigger part of the story because I've had recent experience with a couple

142
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,460
of companies that have been approached by either Google Cloud or Amazon, offering them

143
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,700
a sweetheart deal if they move off of a competitor.

144
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:32,640
So in the case of Google Cloud, the offer was to move off of AWS, and in the case of

145
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,940
AWS, the offer was to move off of Azure.

146
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,400
So if you move off of Azure, we'll cut you a sweetheart deal, you lock that in for this

147
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,920
many years, and now you're an exclusive AWS customer.

148
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,040
They're going around to large companies, but not companies that are significantly large.

149
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,360
We know of a company that has been approached with an offer like this, including there's

150
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,760
some money involved in all of it.

151
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,280
It's a really sweet deal.

152
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,000
And there were media reports back in February that suggested that Apple was cutting ties

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,800
with Microsoft.

154
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,840
Some security documentation was updated that removed mentions of Azure in the documentation,

155
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,000
and then we see this story.

156
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And this is a similar story that we just saw from an IPO and another story we saw recently.

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,560
These stories keep coming out, and I think what is happening here is Amazon and Google

158
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:26,440
and Microsoft are building their fences and trying to land as many whales exclusive to

159
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,880
their platform, to their cloud platform, as possible.

160
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,360
And I think that's what's happening here, and you're going to end up with a whole new

161
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,360
era of lock-in.

162
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,800
Well, that goes back to IBM's strategy with the hybrid cloud approach and how they keep

163
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,240
going on about that.

164
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,320
I've been speaking to sysadmins here at the fest, and they are all very concerned about

165
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
lock-in.

166
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,560
And a lot of their managers are basically forcing them down this route, and they're

167
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,080
just not comfortable with that.

168
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,160
And you can see IBM's pitch against this sort of thing.

169
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,300
And it seems to be almost the cloud wars right now.

170
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,920
And it's not a surprise that Apple has gone down the cloud route.

171
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,080
They have tried to build new data centers, and they realize that it's more hassle than

172
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,080
it's worth.

173
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,400
They may as well pay that premium to use the cloud, because otherwise you end up with these

174
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:24,820
protracted planning permission issues and disputes with contractors and everything.

175
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,360
And so their data center expansion plans have just not gone how they wanted.

176
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,120
So I'm not surprised that they're cutting deals with the likes of Amazon Web Services

177
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,160
to just move on from that and just chuck it in the cloud and forget about it.

178
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,520
Well, and we are going into a big era of services.

179
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,640
Everyone wants to monetize that monthly user, and they've got to build out and expand content

180
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,680
and services around that.

181
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,680
And they're not the only ones.

182
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,760
A lot of businesses are getting into streaming and this kind of stuff, and it's all going

183
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:01,440
to require big fat internet pipes with large internet providers and hosts like Amazon.

184
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
It's going to be a bonanza.

185
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,160
It is a bit of a cloud war.

186
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,300
And maybe this is probably not true, but maybe they're all rallying around right now trying

187
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,360
to get ahead of the IBM Red Hat acquisition.

188
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,340
Because they are uniquely positioning themselves as the anti-lock-in vendor solution.

189
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,440
And so maybe they're trying to get as much lock-in as possible.

190
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,040
There's a funny thing that happened in my neighborhood a decade ago for a brief, beautiful

191
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,760
moment in time, Verizon, our local ISP, was coming in and digging ditches and laying fiber.

192
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,600
It was so beautiful, Joe, beautiful fiber optic internet service right to the home.

193
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,020
And I kid you not, two days before they started digging ditches in my neighborhood, Comcast

194
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,560
reps brought a van.

195
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,000
They all jumped out of the van and spread out around our neighborhood and tried to get

196
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,900
everybody set into a two-year contract because they knew in two or three days the Verizon

197
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,640
diggers would be here running fiber to everybody's home.

198
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,880
And they wanted to get ahead of that.

199
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,240
And that could be what we're seeing happen here with Amazon right now, with AWS.

200
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,400
Well, that's what Google is attempting to do with Anthos.

201
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,680
We talked about that a couple of weeks ago.

202
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,040
But I've spoken to people about that here at The Vest.

203
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,080
And they're concerned that Google is trying to give you the illusion of choice and the

204
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,680
illusion that you're not being locked in, but the keys to the mechanism that allow you

205
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,800
to spread your data around the various clouds and have some on-prem are held by Google.

206
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,080
And so you are essentially locked in there.

207
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,160
So that's their attempt at combating this.

208
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,200
Whereas maybe Amazon's attempt is just offer some sweet deals for people and just get them

209
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,320
locked in and have them just not worry about the lock-in because the deal is so much better

210
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,980
than not being locked in.

211
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,600
Which is even crazier to think that $30 million a month might be a good deal.

212
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,520
That's why everybody just needs to switch to NextCloud Joe and host it themselves and

213
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,680
save about $29 million a month, depending on their size.

214
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,680
It'll vary.

215
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
Yeah.

216
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,600
Well, now with NextCloud 16, they've got machine learning-based security.

217
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Ooh.

218
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:12,680
We were having a laugh about this at The Vest, too, because not that it's not cool.

219
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,480
It's just the actual suggestion was, it was Alan Judy said, you know, if you were to launch

220
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,520
fail to ban, you know, that tool fail to ban for SSH logins today, you would say it's machine

221
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
learning.

222
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,520
Yeah.

223
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:29,840
Because it's looking at IPs and learning who's trying to attack you.

224
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,240
And that's essentially what we're talking about here.

225
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Yeah.

226
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,320
They call it suspicious login detection.

227
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,600
And it uses a locally trained neural network to detect attempts to log in by a malicious

228
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
actor.

229
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,280
There's also other systems in here, like a share recommendation system or whatnot.

230
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,460
But I wanted to focus in on the security thing because this is really cool.

231
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,820
So it does use this locally trained neural network.

232
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,880
So there's no sending off to remote cloud servers or anything like that.

233
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,800
I absolutely appreciate that.

234
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,260
The app tracks successful logins on the instance for a set period of time.

235
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,880
The default is 60 days.

236
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,580
And then it uses the generated data to train its own neural network.

237
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,720
As soon as the first model is trained, the app starts classifying logins from then on.

238
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,360
So it's always learning.

239
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,240
Should it detect a password login classified as suspicious by that now trained model, it

240
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,960
will add that entry, the login entry, to a suspicious login table, including the timestamp,

241
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,320
the request URL, the ID of the client, all of that that it can collect.

242
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,160
And then the user will get a notification.

243
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,120
And the system administrator will be able to see that information in the log.

244
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,000
When the user is notified, they can go to the security section in their settings.

245
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,720
They can terminate that suspicious setting, immediately clear it out.

246
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,400
And then they'll proceed to set a new password.

247
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,760
The administrator can also opt to take action, like disabling the user account or having

248
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,640
the option to just force it to change their password.

249
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,620
And that machine learning stuff also sort of does apply to their new recommendation

250
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,620
and sharing system.

251
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,080
Like, hey, I've noticed you often share these types of files with this person.

252
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,440
And it'll make suggestions around that.

253
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,280
But the suspicious login one, I think, is probably the one that has the most user appeal.

254
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,980
Because honestly, when you have something like Nextcloud exposed to the web, that is

255
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,720
a useful feature.

256
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,200
One new feature that jumped out at me was in the mobile client.

257
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,160
Instead of having to manually enter the server details and the login and password, you can

258
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,420
now just scan a QR code and it just automatically logs you in.

259
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,240
That seems just like a no brainer at this point.

260
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,160
I haven't tried this new feature out.

261
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,920
But if you have found some issues with storage speed, especially on large instances that

262
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,560
are using object storage solutions, there has been a series of improvements on how Nextcloud

263
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,640
handles that code and should result in improved snappiness, they say.

264
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,480
That's funny you mentioned snappiness.

265
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,120
I would have normally tried this.

266
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,960
We've been very busy with the fest.

267
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,320
I did have a quick look to see if the snap had been updated to 16.

268
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,060
Unfortunately, it hasn't yet.

269
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,600
So I wasn't able to even quickly test this.

270
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,120
But I do look forward to doing those tests when I get back to the UK.

271
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,800
Because it feels like Nextcloud is starting to really mature now.

272
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,480
And it's something that I need to give a proper assessment to.

273
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,280
Because it's been a long time since I properly tested it.

274
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,240
And I wasn't very impressed with the consistency of it at the time.

275
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,240
Because it only has to not work once for me to not want to use it.

276
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,240
But maybe now's the time that it could go into production.

277
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,240
I don't know.

278
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,240
I need to test it.

279
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,280
Yeah, it seems Cheese Bacon on our team has been having some success with it.

280
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,480
He uses it to manage some of his photos and share some assets that he creates for the

281
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
team.

282
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
And yeah, he did it through the snap.

283
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,640
So he's running version 15 through the snap.

284
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,800
And it seems like it's worked.

285
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,120
I've tried it out a bit, the older version, through the snap so that I thought it would

286
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,520
maybe self-update and whatnot.

287
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,840
And I found it remarkably simple to get going.

288
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,080
There's so many different ways now to use Nextcloud, from hosted to container images

289
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,960
to snaps or just traditional installations, that if you've been toying with the idea,

290
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:00,000
you'll find an installation, I guess, methodology that is approachable, regardless of your skill

291
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
level.

292
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,760
We are rolling out this update to 16 in a staged fashion.

293
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,000
So don't be surprised if it takes a while to get updated to it.

294
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,780
But you can switch to the beta channel if you want it sooner rather than later.

295
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,760
And to bring it all back around, our last story of the week is another success story.

296
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,400
Well, I guess for the hacker.

297
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,560
Yeah, this is the French government's fork of Riot, which I think is called Chap or

298
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,560
Chap.

299
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
I don't know.

300
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,980
I'm not good at French.

301
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,160
Which is a matrix client.

302
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,120
And we talked about this a few weeks ago, how they were moving all of the messaging

303
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,520
infrastructure to matrix, which is a huge win for open source in government.

304
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,800
But unfortunately, it seems they didn't do an amazing job of the implementation of this.

305
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,820
No, the issue really came down to something pretty simple.

306
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:55,840
And it resulted in the app getting compromised within about an hour.

307
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,840
That's rough, Joe.

308
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:04,720
Yeah, it was really just a simple email parsing mistake in a Python script that parsed input

309
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,640
to validate if this was a government email address or not.

310
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,340
And it would issue a token that would be sent to an address that the attacker could get

311
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:19,000
changed or could influence and then get access to the chat system and have his way with it.

312
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,360
And you know, the thing is, is they haven't been dissuaded.

313
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,420
They say the French government will continue to roll it out.

314
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,100
They want to encourage people to stop using WhatsApp and Telegram for any informal communications

315
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,680
between government employees, agencies, and some handpicked non government organizations

316
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
and contractors.

317
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
So they're still going to use it.

318
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,320
They just got to fix that Python script problem.

319
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,320
Yeah.

320
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,320
It was quite embarrassing for them, though, because some of the groups and stuff they've

321
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,340
got in there are just like, what are they doing?

322
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,280
Like sharing pictures of yellow things and stuff.

323
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,360
They're bonding, Joe.

324
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
They're bonding.

325
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
It's team building, Joe.

326
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
Yeah.

327
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,560
I suppose we probably share worse things in our Slack.

328
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,720
I don't know about things of yellow pictures of things, but we definitely have some weird

329
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,720
things in our threads.

330
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
That's true.

331
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,700
And it's funny that the hacker calls himself Elliot Anderson and he's obviously obsessed

332
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,700
with Mr. Robot.

333
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,700
Yeah.

334
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Yeah.

335
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
It's about half a Linux fest in Northwest.

336
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
And it was a great fest.

337
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,700
Thank you everybody who made it out this year.

338
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,920
We had our biggest barbecue ever.

339
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:20,360
Well over 100 people out there that we were cooking for and we had to go out and do emergency

340
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,360
pizza runs.

341
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,500
Yeah, I think more like 300 really came.

342
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,600
It was an amazing party.

343
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:32,440
And yeah, look out for the pictures of Noah on Twitter in a pink leotard or swimming costume.

344
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,440
It happened.

345
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
It happened.

346
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
It was a great fest.

347
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,440
We learned a lot.

348
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,100
I had a bunch of good conversations.

349
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,120
We were able to record some of our talks and all of that.

350
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,640
So keep your ears out for updates on that in the future.
