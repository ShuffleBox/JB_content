00:00.000 --> 00:09.080
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 160, recorded on October 25th, 2020.

00:09.080 --> 00:10.080
I'm Chris.

00:10.080 --> 00:11.080
And I'm Joe.

00:11.080 --> 00:12.080
Hello, Joe.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.600
It's good to be connected with you on your final episode of Linux Action News.

00:15.600 --> 00:19.560
Yeah, Wes is taking over next week, but I'll be back at the end of the year for a predictions

00:19.560 --> 00:20.560
episode.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.240
I've got to beat you at that one last time.

00:22.240 --> 00:26.600
And we've got a big batch of news this week to send you off to, so a lot to get into.

00:26.600 --> 00:30.200
So let's start with Ubuntu 2010 released.

00:30.200 --> 00:34.480
Now this is just an interim release, so it's not an LTS, a long term support.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.720
So it's only going to be supported for nine months.

00:36.720 --> 00:40.400
So you don't expect to see too much great in there.

00:40.400 --> 00:43.240
And for me, not much has changed.

00:43.240 --> 00:48.460
I think a sure sign that not much has changed is when Joey's article at OMG Ubuntu includes

00:48.460 --> 00:50.840
new wallpapers on the list of features.

00:50.840 --> 00:54.760
Hey, I know some of those in corporate life will be happy to see Active Directory support

00:54.760 --> 00:56.660
landing in the installer.

00:56.660 --> 01:00.280
And some folks out there with newer hardware will appreciate Linux 5.8.

01:00.280 --> 01:04.320
But I think the headline feature here with 2010 groovy gorilla is the Raspberry Pi four

01:04.320 --> 01:05.620
desktop support.

01:05.620 --> 01:09.320
Of course, previous versions of Ubuntu were officially supported on the Raspberry Pi,

01:09.320 --> 01:11.000
but only the server additions.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.600
This is the first release that has got official desktop support.

01:14.600 --> 01:20.440
Yeah, and that means you get the GNOME desktop version of Ubuntu on a Raspberry Pi four.

01:20.440 --> 01:24.360
Now you need to have either a four gigabyte or eight gigabyte model to pull this off.

01:24.360 --> 01:30.320
But with this, you essentially have the entire suite, the family of Ubuntu's available for

01:30.320 --> 01:34.240
the Raspberry Pi from the server stuff, which has gotten even better with 2010.

01:34.240 --> 01:37.320
I don't know many folks will be running 2010 as a server.

01:37.320 --> 01:42.800
But if you are running disposable edge infrastructure, there's a lot to like about 2010.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.520
And its support for Raspberry Pi's means you could have on demand edge devices running

01:46.520 --> 01:48.040
on ARM.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.080
That's pretty compelling.

01:49.080 --> 01:52.320
But you could see where this is going long term, Joe, this is going to eventually all

01:52.320 --> 01:57.240
roll into the next LTS release, which is still a bit off, still a ways down the road from

01:57.240 --> 01:58.240
now.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.240
But you got to get these things lined up.

01:59.240 --> 02:04.960
And I think this is where Canonical is being really clever, because I don't know who is

02:04.960 --> 02:12.440
really chomping at the bit today to have the Ubuntu GNOME desktop on Raspberry Pi four,

02:12.440 --> 02:14.240
but it's there, and they're supporting it.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.120
And as a company, they're aligning behind it.

02:16.120 --> 02:20.200
In fact, Mark Shulderworth's statement seems to really indicate a deep commitment.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.600
They say in this release, we celebrate the Raspberry Pi's foundation to commitment to

02:23.600 --> 02:27.600
put open computing in the hands of people all over the world.

02:27.600 --> 02:31.720
We're honored to support this initiative by optimizing Ubuntu on the Raspberry Pi, whether

02:31.720 --> 02:36.320
it's for personal use, educational purposes, or as the foundations of their next business

02:36.320 --> 02:37.320
venture.

02:37.320 --> 02:41.760
This is Canonical preparing for a platform that I think has a lot of legs still.

02:41.760 --> 02:46.520
We're only just beginning to see the Raspberry Pi foundation's hardware capabilities.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.080
And the Raspberry Pi four is already pretty impressive.

02:49.080 --> 02:52.680
But imagine, like I've been saying for a while, what the Pi five is going to bring in the

02:52.680 --> 02:56.120
Pi six, and what else they might be working on.

02:56.120 --> 03:01.600
And I think it's really clever for Canonical to align the company behind this and prepare

03:01.600 --> 03:03.080
for that future.

03:03.080 --> 03:07.320
And you do that today by getting an interim release up and running on the desktop.

03:07.320 --> 03:12.400
Yeah, this is the perfect time to have your first desktop release on the Pi, because it's

03:12.400 --> 03:15.780
an interim, and it's the first interim after the LTS.

03:15.780 --> 03:19.480
So they've got 18 months now until 2204 comes out.

03:19.480 --> 03:22.920
And that's plenty of time to iron out the issues.

03:22.920 --> 03:28.680
I was a little bit skeptical that GNOME was going to perform well on the Raspberry Pi,

03:28.680 --> 03:30.120
even the four.

03:30.120 --> 03:36.040
And I think this release has vindicated my skepticism, because it does feel a lot slower

03:36.040 --> 03:42.040
and just generally more sluggish than Raspberry Pi OS, which is not a huge surprise, because

03:42.040 --> 03:45.840
the Raspberry Pi Foundation have been making that disk drive for a long time.

03:45.840 --> 03:49.280
They've had a lot of time to iron out any issues with it.

03:49.280 --> 03:53.680
And it's also an LXDE desktop, which is inherently lighter than GNOME.

03:53.680 --> 03:54.680
Right.

03:54.680 --> 03:59.160
And I think you'd have a similar experience with Mate versus GNOME on the Raspberry Pi

03:59.160 --> 04:00.160
four.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.480
Mate is going to perform better, just like XFCE will.

04:02.480 --> 04:06.440
And this is not, I think, what is driving the decision here.

04:06.440 --> 04:10.760
Canonical is perfectly aware of this performance difference.

04:10.760 --> 04:14.920
I think it's really about getting the team, about getting the resources and staffing in

04:14.920 --> 04:19.720
place to enable this complete port of Ubuntu to this platform.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.400
So it's not just the server.

04:21.400 --> 04:24.880
It can be the entire legitimate Ubuntu desktop.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.520
And you start now.

04:26.520 --> 04:29.800
And yeah, you're absolutely going to win the performance argument every day of the week

04:29.800 --> 04:31.600
right now with the Raspberry Pi four.

04:31.600 --> 04:36.960
You're going to have a better experience with LXDE or LXCUTE or XFCE on this hardware.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.080
Just no doubt about it.

04:38.080 --> 04:42.040
But it's damn impressive that GNOME Shell is in good enough shape and the Raspberry

04:42.040 --> 04:47.280
Pi four is fast enough that you can actually do it like that, first of all, is surprising

04:47.280 --> 04:48.280
to me.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.480
And second of all, like I've said a couple of times now, you can see where it's going

04:50.480 --> 04:52.280
to go in a few more iterations of the Pi.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.280
It's going to be just fine.

04:53.280 --> 04:57.240
And imagine if you're building yourself a desktop around the Pi four.

04:57.240 --> 05:00.880
It's kind of nice to even have Canonical doing this because you know now that if Ubuntu is

05:00.880 --> 05:05.840
your distro of choice, your hardware platform is being taken seriously by them.

05:05.840 --> 05:09.840
I don't know if you've seen it, but you can get Pi cases now that have legitimate cooling.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.280
They put all the ports on the back.

05:11.280 --> 05:15.600
You hook it right up and you can have a mouse and keyboard hooked up to a monitor and it's

05:15.600 --> 05:16.600
usable.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.720
I don't know if I'd do it with GNOME Shell, though, but I could see where it's going to

05:18.720 --> 05:19.720
get there.

05:19.720 --> 05:24.160
Yeah, I think over the next 18 months it will get there and hopefully I'll be proven wrong

05:24.160 --> 05:27.160
and GNOME will be optimized enough to run on it.

05:27.160 --> 05:31.140
And it's all about the hardware acceleration and getting all that tweaked perfectly.

05:31.140 --> 05:36.200
This is a good start, but it's not really daily driver ready just yet, I don't think.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.500
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.480
I agree with the light experimenting that I did.

05:40.480 --> 05:44.600
However, I tip my hat because I think they're betting that this platform is going places

05:44.600 --> 05:45.920
and there's more to come.

05:45.920 --> 05:47.840
I think it's a smart bet.

05:47.840 --> 05:52.120
Well if you want to run Windows on your Chromebook, Parallels Desktop for Chromebook Enterprise

05:52.120 --> 05:53.160
is out.

05:53.160 --> 05:57.120
This was announced back in June, but here we are actually seeing it come to fruition.

05:57.120 --> 06:03.800
And for $69.99 per year per user, plus the Windows license, you can have a full Windows

06:03.800 --> 06:08.840
10 desktop within Chrome OS, but only if you are an Enterprise customer.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.360
That's part of the big sell here, isn't it?

06:10.360 --> 06:15.440
Is that it can be managed and deployed from your standard Chrome management suites, fully

06:15.440 --> 06:16.740
ready to go with Windows.

06:16.740 --> 06:21.480
You can deploy it to a Chromebook remotely and then the user double clicks one icon and

06:21.480 --> 06:22.800
the thing's up and going.

06:22.800 --> 06:27.640
And they're really selling hard on the integration with the OS, the mouse cursor, the copy paste

06:27.640 --> 06:32.760
support, and then kind of trying to close the deal by talking about how great it will

06:32.760 --> 06:37.160
be for you to run Microsoft Office on your Google Chromebook.

06:37.160 --> 06:41.420
And that really tells us who's driving this, is there must be a customer that wants Microsoft

06:41.420 --> 06:47.160
Office, not the cloud version now, the full Windows version on the desktop.

06:47.160 --> 06:49.600
And they also want a Chromebook.

06:49.600 --> 06:50.600
Well think about it.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.640
That's the one solution to rule them all now, potentially.

06:53.640 --> 06:58.880
You can buy a high end Chromebook and it has to have at least an i5 or i7 and 16 gigabytes

06:58.880 --> 07:03.060
of RAM and 128 gigabytes of storage.

07:03.060 --> 07:09.280
But then you've got a machine that can run Chrome OS and be updated and have the best

07:09.280 --> 07:11.080
bits about Linux.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.080
You can run a complete version of Windows 10.

07:13.080 --> 07:18.320
You've got all the Android apps and you've got proper Linux support via Debian VM.

07:18.320 --> 07:19.320
Yep.

07:19.320 --> 07:23.480
And you get all of the benefits of a simple Chromebook for the users who don't need this.

07:23.480 --> 07:28.720
So you could buy these machines for your school, for your business, deploy them and manage

07:28.720 --> 07:33.000
them with the Google admin console, which is pretty tight and pretty well done.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.400
And then for the handful of users that need the extras that are only available in local

07:38.400 --> 07:41.560
office, you deploy this with some single clicks.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.960
Well, I'm sure it's more than that, but that's how they pitch it.

07:43.960 --> 07:48.880
And they actually do mention in here some of the things that users might want that aren't

07:48.880 --> 07:51.640
in the full version of Office, funny enough.

07:51.640 --> 07:53.900
If you want trend lines, you have to have full Excel.

07:53.900 --> 07:56.840
If you want tables in Word, you've got to have full Word.

07:56.840 --> 08:01.280
If you want custom fonts or headers or footers in PowerPoint, well, you've got to have full

08:01.280 --> 08:04.160
PowerPoint and that's who they're targeting this at.

08:04.160 --> 08:08.840
Maybe you have a shop that has several hundred users and maybe only 30 of them need this

08:08.840 --> 08:13.560
Windows VM and the rest can all be totally plugged into the Google ecosystem and have

08:13.560 --> 08:14.560
everything they need.

08:14.560 --> 08:21.040
Meanwhile, as a business, every four or five years, you're buying them like $1,000 Chromebook.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.040
I could see it.

08:22.040 --> 08:26.640
I see it maybe a little more in education, but I guess I can kind of get it.

08:26.640 --> 08:30.600
It seems like a funny way to go about it when you have things like remote desktop as an

08:30.600 --> 08:35.800
option, but I guess if you're offline, you want something fully local, this is probably

08:35.800 --> 08:36.800
the best way to go.

08:36.800 --> 08:40.360
Well, especially as people are working more from home these days where internet connections

08:40.360 --> 08:46.040
can be a bit ropey, having a full offline version of Windows that you can still work

08:46.040 --> 08:50.200
on your documents while your internet's down for a couple of hours is a pretty good sell

08:50.200 --> 08:54.780
for a Chromebook which, at least when they started, were completely cloud connected and

08:54.780 --> 08:56.040
internet connection dependent.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.280
I feel like you're talking about me there a little bit.

08:58.280 --> 08:59.280
Yeah, that's true.

08:59.280 --> 09:03.320
I hadn't even thought of you where, yeah, sometimes you go off into the woods and have

09:03.320 --> 09:06.040
got no internet for a couple of days even.

09:06.040 --> 09:10.800
But we talked about Ubuntu at the beginning of the show and that is a great distribution

09:10.800 --> 09:13.600
to use on the desktop and it's doing well.

09:13.600 --> 09:19.000
But for the mainstream crowd, this is how Linux on the desktop wins.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.480
Some of our community doesn't necessarily like it that Chrome OS is a massively popular

09:24.480 --> 09:29.520
Linux desktop, but it is and you can't really argue with that.

09:29.520 --> 09:35.600
And so a combination of Chrome OS, Windows subsystem for Linux, and proper distros like

09:35.600 --> 09:41.720
Ubuntu are how we have won on the desktop with Linux.

09:41.720 --> 09:44.160
It's just not kind of how people imagined it would be.

09:44.160 --> 09:47.720
I think that kind of sums up how life is these days, Joe.

09:47.720 --> 09:53.800
Just not how we thought it would be, but it is what it is.

09:53.800 --> 09:58.000
System76.com, we've been talking about them recently and now they've made some big news

09:58.000 --> 10:00.020
with the Thaleo Mega.

10:00.020 --> 10:04.960
It's the world's smallest quad GPU workstation made for deep learning and scientific computing,

10:04.960 --> 10:07.840
although I suspect you could game with it too.

10:07.840 --> 10:13.240
And it has the same beautiful design, that Thaleo look, but even in a smaller compact

10:13.240 --> 10:14.240
unit now.

10:14.240 --> 10:18.360
So go to System76.com and check out the Thaleo Mega, run it through the configurator and

10:18.360 --> 10:21.440
see how you can build this just the way you like it.

10:21.440 --> 10:24.840
You can go up to 256 gigabytes of quad channel RAM.

10:24.840 --> 10:29.280
You can put four GPUs, super high end GPUs if you want.

10:29.280 --> 10:34.880
And that's why System76 took great care to make sure the airflow in the Mega is top notch.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.960
It's way beyond industry standard stuff here.

10:37.960 --> 10:42.540
Everything down to the GPU brace developed to secure the GPUs for transit has been designed

10:42.540 --> 10:45.340
for maximum thermal efficiency.

10:45.340 --> 10:49.460
And just like the previous units, the Mega is open source hardware, which is up on GitHub.

10:49.460 --> 10:53.480
It's handcrafted and manufactured right there in Denver, Colorado.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.200
They're designed and built in the US.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.320
So check them out, System76.com.

10:57.320 --> 11:01.920
And if you get something, tell them Linux Action News sent you.

11:01.920 --> 11:06.720
One of the biggest controversies of the week was YouTube DL being removed from GitHub thanks

11:06.720 --> 11:09.480
to a DMCA request by the RIAA.

11:09.480 --> 11:15.320
Yeah, the RIAA is the Recording Industry Association of America, and they have utilized

11:15.320 --> 11:19.580
a DMCA takedown request, Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

11:19.580 --> 11:24.560
It is the oldest trick in the book, but what is different this time is the takedown request

11:24.560 --> 11:28.040
was based on entries in YouTube DL's source code.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.860
So let that sink in for a moment.

11:29.860 --> 11:34.460
Now they're going through and scanning potential copyright violations in open source source

11:34.460 --> 11:35.960
code up on GitHub.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.720
And I actually think it was part of a blitz, Joe.

11:37.720 --> 11:41.840
I think it was 18 projects in total that were taken down around the time that YouTube DL

11:41.840 --> 11:42.840
was taken down.

11:42.840 --> 11:49.260
Generally speaking, previously, they've gone after organizations and people who are engaged

11:49.260 --> 11:51.840
in copyright infringements directly.

11:51.840 --> 11:56.760
Whereas the difference here is that they're going after a tool which can be used for copyright

11:56.760 --> 11:57.760
infringement.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.120
And that is a bit of a change of tactic by them.

12:00.120 --> 12:05.760
Yeah, in a letter sent to GitHub, the RIAA argued that the clear purpose of the source

12:05.760 --> 12:10.360
code was to circumvent the technological protection measures used to authorize streaming services

12:10.360 --> 12:16.080
such as YouTube, and to allow users to reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings

12:16.080 --> 12:17.640
without authorization.

12:17.640 --> 12:24.080
Because obviously the only use for YouTube DL, which downloads and archives videos from

12:24.080 --> 12:29.520
thousands of websites, obviously, the only use of that tool is music piracy.

12:29.520 --> 12:37.120
Well, to be fair, in YouTube DL's examples, they use the URLs of videos like Taylor Swift

12:37.120 --> 12:44.680
and Justin Timberlake, which was a little bit short sighted by the YouTube DL project.

12:44.680 --> 12:49.880
They should have used some Creative Commons video maybe like Big Buck Bunny or something

12:49.880 --> 12:53.800
rather than, hey, you can use this to download Shake It Off.

12:53.800 --> 12:54.800
Right.

12:54.800 --> 13:00.040
They were likely scanning for the very URLs for those popular music videos, the RIAA was,

13:00.040 --> 13:03.520
and they found it in source code on GitHub.

13:03.520 --> 13:09.680
I am not comfortable with them scanning GitHub and issuing takedowns like this, but it's

13:09.680 --> 13:13.680
come to my attention that this isn't totally uncommon behavior on the GitHub platform.

13:13.680 --> 13:19.640
In fact, even open source projects like MB have used the DMCA takedown process on GitHub.

13:19.640 --> 13:26.440
So it's not totally uncommon, but this idea that perhaps a violation could exist by linking

13:26.440 --> 13:31.840
to a URL or suggesting people download a URL in one part of the source code or in one part

13:31.840 --> 13:37.200
of the documentation shouldn't necessarily equal takedown the entire project immediately.

13:37.200 --> 13:41.960
The developers of YouTube DL found out about this by trying to just work on their project.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.380
In fact, I'll link to this in the show notes.

13:44.380 --> 13:48.400
At first, because they were constantly living under fear of this, at first they just assumed

13:48.400 --> 13:49.600
it was Google.

13:49.600 --> 13:53.800
They just assumed it was Google that did the takedown because why wouldn't they come after

13:53.800 --> 13:57.000
them for even just calling their project YouTube DL?

13:57.000 --> 14:01.120
So they just naturally assumed that it was Google that caused it, and then they figured

14:01.120 --> 14:07.640
out after they got access to the information that it was actually a takedown from the RIAA.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.800
But imagine that use case.

14:09.800 --> 14:15.200
You're a developer working on a worldwide famous project that is used to do all kinds

14:15.200 --> 14:21.320
of things from live stream capturing to backing up videos that are just on a news website,

14:21.320 --> 14:22.320
right?

14:22.320 --> 14:24.840
It has potentially nothing to even do with YouTube, and all of a sudden you're going

14:24.840 --> 14:28.840
to check in on this project and you get access denied, and you think, what's wrong with my

14:28.840 --> 14:29.840
account?

14:29.840 --> 14:30.840
What's wrong?

14:30.840 --> 14:31.840
What's going on?

14:31.840 --> 14:32.840
Has my password been changed?

14:32.840 --> 14:33.840
Did somebody hack my account?

14:33.840 --> 14:34.840
What's happening here?

14:34.840 --> 14:40.280
And then you discover after the fact that your project is already down, it's already

14:40.280 --> 14:46.280
offline, it has GitHub, or actually let's be honest, Microsoft, because it's Microsoft

14:46.280 --> 14:51.360
who owns GitHub and they have to own the good and the bad here, Microsoft has taken a popular

14:51.360 --> 14:55.200
well-known free software project offline without even notifying the developers.

14:55.200 --> 14:59.200
I mean, they probably issued them some sort of automatic email that they missed, but there

14:59.200 --> 15:01.320
was no due process here.

15:01.320 --> 15:05.440
There was no chance for them to first contact the project and tell the project, hey, we've

15:05.440 --> 15:08.880
received this complaint and they believe this violation has occurred.

15:08.880 --> 15:09.880
Would you like to respond?

15:09.880 --> 15:10.880
Boom.

15:10.880 --> 15:11.880
Immediate action.

15:11.880 --> 15:12.880
They shut it down.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.680
And that is ridiculous.

15:14.680 --> 15:20.640
This makes me worried because I use YouTube TL a fair bit here and there and what's going

15:20.640 --> 15:21.640
to happen?

15:21.640 --> 15:25.520
I've got this snap of it installed now, but that's probably not going to get any updates

15:25.520 --> 15:27.100
unless this gets sorted out.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.360
You would have thought that one of the forks will survive and we'll probably just have

15:30.360 --> 15:37.520
to use that, but it's a dangerous precedent here going after open source tools.

15:37.520 --> 15:41.920
What about, for example, New Pipe, the Android app that I use, which is totally open source.

15:41.920 --> 15:44.280
I use that to watch YouTube videos on my phone.

15:44.280 --> 15:47.240
Are they going to go after that now because you can download videos there?

15:47.240 --> 15:48.300
We'll just have to wait and see.

15:48.300 --> 15:51.560
If they decide to start targeting tools like this all the time, it's going to be a real

15:51.560 --> 15:52.560
problem.

15:52.560 --> 15:58.520
I bet every clip I've ever played in any Linux podcast from an open source event or speech

15:58.520 --> 16:03.660
or conference or presentation was likely captured with YouTube TL.

16:03.660 --> 16:05.400
And there was no issue.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.400
It was Creative Commons.

16:06.400 --> 16:10.160
It's a totally legitimate use of a tool here.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.920
I often will save things offline to just watch later.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.760
I'm a YouTube premium subscriber too, so I'm paying per month.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.680
I don't get ads anyways.

16:19.680 --> 16:25.260
I've never preferred to monetize the creators I watch by watching penny ads on YouTube for

16:25.260 --> 16:26.260
shaving cream.

16:26.260 --> 16:30.560
Instead, I just prefer to either monetize directly through Patreon or some other platform

16:30.560 --> 16:33.960
or to at least do a YouTube Red subscription so then everybody wins.

16:33.960 --> 16:37.880
In that case, in that use case, why can't I download the videos?

16:37.880 --> 16:42.840
Why can't I watch them, especially if the creators are smart enough to come up with

16:42.840 --> 16:48.460
a way to monetize directly and not rely on an arbitrary per bid advertising platform

16:48.460 --> 16:53.040
that rewards the lowest brow content possible?

16:53.040 --> 16:57.720
The argument here that you're using it to steal music videos seems ludicrous because

16:57.720 --> 17:00.840
there's really no need to steal music videos anymore.

17:00.840 --> 17:02.200
They're so plentiful.

17:02.200 --> 17:07.760
They're so available online that there's really nothing driving, incentivizing you to do this

17:07.760 --> 17:12.000
unless you are an archivist or you're storing it offline.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.440
The use case here seems so niche.

17:14.440 --> 17:18.220
It seems like such a minority of what this tool will be used for that it's silly that

17:18.220 --> 17:20.480
that's what has framed the argument.

17:20.480 --> 17:26.040
Surely, anyone who is smart enough to figure out how to use YouTube DL on the command line

17:26.040 --> 17:29.600
is smart enough to install an ad blocker as well.

17:29.600 --> 17:36.520
That argument of this is somehow denying these artists or record companies ad revenue seems

17:36.520 --> 17:37.520
a bit spurious.

17:37.520 --> 17:45.240
It's surely a tiny minority of people who are using tools like this to view the videos

17:45.240 --> 17:48.480
rather than just the official app and seeing through the ads and skipping them when they're

17:48.480 --> 17:50.400
allowed and stuff.

17:50.400 --> 17:55.080
This just seems like the RIAA just trying to justify their existence.

17:55.080 --> 18:01.240
Right, and they're hoping they can lean on this old horse here, but anybody who publishes

18:01.240 --> 18:06.680
on YouTube can go look at their information on the sources, and you'll see most commonly

18:06.680 --> 18:07.680
it's mobile.

18:07.680 --> 18:13.300
That's going to be the top, and then you'll have web, and then there's other in there.

18:13.300 --> 18:17.840
That's the category that YouTube DL will fall into.

18:17.840 --> 18:22.800
For Jupyter broadcasting, which you have to figure has a probably higher than average

18:22.800 --> 18:28.920
awareness of a tool like YouTube DL in that audience, it's like 3% of other, and that's

18:28.920 --> 18:31.460
going to include things besides just YouTube DL, too.

18:31.460 --> 18:35.160
That's going to include pretty much anything that's hitting the API to play that video

18:35.160 --> 18:38.160
is counted as other.

18:38.160 --> 18:44.160
Amongst other things like Roku apps and set top boxes, YouTube DL is in that grouping,

18:44.160 --> 18:50.320
and in a predominantly very technical community who is turned on to open source tools, it's

18:50.320 --> 18:52.080
like a 3% group.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.080
It's tiny.

18:53.080 --> 18:57.640
You'd imagine the average Taylor Swift video has got to be less than 1%, probably less

18:57.640 --> 19:01.040
than 0.1% people using YouTube DL.

19:01.040 --> 19:08.160
This is really about the RIAA developing tools to scan through the source code of public

19:08.160 --> 19:13.840
open source projects and then automating a process to go after them to shut them down.

19:13.840 --> 19:19.900
They're using the revenue as a bit of a gaslight to make this okay, so that way there's not

19:19.900 --> 19:21.760
a big negative reaction to this.

19:21.760 --> 19:25.840
The RIAA, if you go back through history, has had a couple of really big public cases

19:25.840 --> 19:28.140
that brought them some really bad PR.

19:28.140 --> 19:30.220
That's actually why people hate the name so much.

19:30.220 --> 19:35.120
When you say the name, it's got to be one of the worst brands in American history.

19:35.120 --> 19:40.320
It's in part because of just a couple of really horrible public cases where they went after

19:40.320 --> 19:44.440
a grandma for downloading music on Napster.

19:44.440 --> 19:48.760
They know now that when they do something like this, they have to control the narrative.

19:48.760 --> 19:51.020
They have to put something out there.

19:51.020 --> 19:54.520
By saying that the clear purpose of this source code, remember this is their direct quote,

19:54.520 --> 19:59.440
the clear purpose of this source code is to circumvent the technological protection measures

19:59.440 --> 20:03.200
used by authorized streaming services such as YouTube.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.520
That's what it's really about.

20:04.520 --> 20:08.060
It's about going after the tool that could make this possible, even if they can't even

20:08.060 --> 20:09.400
quantify the cost.

20:09.400 --> 20:12.980
They had got to control this, they got to justify this kind of control, and that's how

20:12.980 --> 20:15.040
they're doing it, is with the monetization angle.

20:15.040 --> 20:22.760
Well, you can still download the binaries and a tar wall from their website, youtube-dl.org.

20:22.760 --> 20:24.120
This hasn't even worked.

20:24.120 --> 20:29.620
It does say that their dev repository is down, but downloads are still working.

20:29.620 --> 20:32.800
This is really just a Streisand effect situation here.

20:32.800 --> 20:36.080
Probably more people than ever have found out about this.

20:36.080 --> 20:40.040
Technical people who otherwise didn't know about it will be using it.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.040
Well done, RIAA.

20:41.040 --> 20:46.280
Shot yourselves in the foot there.

20:46.280 --> 20:49.440
If you're on Wi-Fi a lot, then why are you always paying for data?

20:49.440 --> 20:51.620
Why not just pay for what you use?

20:51.620 --> 20:53.760
That is what makes Ting special.

20:53.760 --> 20:57.360
A fair price for however much you talk, text, and however much data you use.

20:57.360 --> 21:01.320
And they have three nationwide networks for you to choose from, so rest assured Ting has

21:01.320 --> 21:03.300
you covered coast to coast.

21:03.300 --> 21:06.520
My latest device I activated with Ting, it's a Verizon device.

21:06.520 --> 21:09.680
It's brilliant having them all under one control panel.

21:09.680 --> 21:12.600
And speaking of control panel, you are always in control.

21:12.600 --> 21:16.520
You can see your usage at a glance, you can set usage alerts, you can nickname accounts

21:16.520 --> 21:19.920
so you know what account is using what, and let's talk devices.

21:19.920 --> 21:24.280
They've got all of the devices, from iPhones to Androids, or bring your own.

21:24.280 --> 21:27.880
You can go check out the Ting shop, just do me a favor and start at linux.ting.com.

21:27.880 --> 21:33.160
That'll take $25 off a device, or if you bring a device, you go to linux.ting.com, they'll

21:33.160 --> 21:35.280
give you $25 in service credit.

21:35.280 --> 21:38.680
Now your average Ting bill, $23, $24 a month.

21:38.680 --> 21:42.360
So if you go to linux.ting.com, that'll cover your first month of Ting.

21:42.360 --> 21:46.560
So go check it out, linux.ting.com.

21:46.560 --> 21:50.680
We have to mention Microsoft Edge arriving for Linux.

21:50.680 --> 21:54.720
It's only in preview, and you did talk about it on Linux Unplugged, but we couldn't let

21:54.720 --> 21:55.720
this one go by.

21:55.720 --> 21:56.720
This is a pretty big deal.

21:56.720 --> 22:01.620
Yeah, this preview officially supports Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and OpenSUSE.

22:01.620 --> 22:02.960
Nothing out there for the Pi yet.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.440
They're looking at ARM, Microsoft says.

22:04.440 --> 22:08.240
I've tried it on Fedora, and I've tried it on Ubuntu.

22:08.240 --> 22:11.680
And I guess I liked it better than I thought I would.

22:11.680 --> 22:15.160
You know, it's still lacking a few critical features for me to actually seriously use

22:15.160 --> 22:16.160
it.

22:16.160 --> 22:21.500
But this last go-around, when 2010 came out and Fedora 33 is about to come out, I decided

22:21.500 --> 22:26.380
to try those distros with Firefox and Edge.

22:26.380 --> 22:29.720
And it kind of reminded me of the early days of Chrome.

22:29.720 --> 22:33.760
Remember when Chrome first launched, it was all about being lean and mean and fast?

22:33.760 --> 22:35.680
That was what Chrome's whole pitch was?

22:35.680 --> 22:36.680
That's kind of Edge.

22:36.680 --> 22:37.920
It's lean and mean.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.840
And it's also Chrome.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.360
And it has good fonts.

22:41.360 --> 22:45.800
The fonts, to my eye, are some of the best-looking fonts on a Linux web browser.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.440
Well, I tried this briefly.

22:48.440 --> 22:52.920
And all I can say is it's a fine browser, I suppose.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.620
I just don't have any motivation to use it.

22:55.620 --> 23:01.640
When I've got Firefox as my main browser, and I've got Chrome installed for a few websites

23:01.640 --> 23:05.460
that need it, I just don't have any motivation here to use this.

23:05.460 --> 23:06.840
And so it was only on a test machine.

23:06.840 --> 23:11.920
I used it for a good couple of hours, but there was nothing compelling enough about

23:11.920 --> 23:14.400
it to make me make the change.

23:14.400 --> 23:17.960
I think it's really about developers coming to where developers are at and giving them

23:17.960 --> 23:22.080
tooling so that way they can test their projects under Edge.

23:22.080 --> 23:25.160
And those aspects of it there are actually looking kind of solid.

23:25.160 --> 23:27.680
There's also things that are missing, like sync.

23:27.680 --> 23:32.080
So if you want to sync across multiple machines, there's nothing there for you just yet.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.080
They're still new to this.

23:33.080 --> 23:36.100
I mean, they only got Edge out for Windows not so long ago.

23:36.100 --> 23:39.720
And then they released it for the Mac in January of 2020.

23:39.720 --> 23:42.100
And now here we are in the fall of 2020.

23:42.100 --> 23:43.800
And it's landing for Linux.

23:43.800 --> 23:48.560
I got a lot of feedback from people after we did this show where we were kind of like,

23:48.560 --> 23:51.680
hmm, hmm, I don't get this, hmm, I don't know about this.

23:51.680 --> 23:52.740
A lot of people know about it.

23:52.740 --> 23:59.120
They wrote me and said, yeah, I'm in corporate situation Y, or I'm working on project X,

23:59.120 --> 24:01.920
or I need it because of reason Z.

24:01.920 --> 24:07.520
And it made me realize that there's already a lot of people waiting for this.

24:07.520 --> 24:08.760
You wouldn't think so.

24:08.760 --> 24:12.640
You wouldn't think a Microsoft browser on Linux would be something people are anticipating.

24:12.640 --> 24:16.140
But just based on the feedback alone I got, I know some people are.

24:16.140 --> 24:19.460
And now that I have used it, I think it's a perfectly fine browser.

24:19.460 --> 24:24.600
And I think it pushes forward on fonts on the desktop Linux, which is surprising to

24:24.600 --> 24:25.660
me, but it's there.

24:25.660 --> 24:27.320
And I think it's worth taking a look at.

24:27.320 --> 24:30.800
I don't think this is going to be many people's primary browser.

24:30.800 --> 24:35.560
But I think there'll be a lot of people who have it installed for testing and for the

24:35.560 --> 24:40.360
odd thing that needs it and for compliance reasons or whatever.

24:40.360 --> 24:42.600
So I think it will find its audience on Linux.

24:42.600 --> 24:48.320
I don't think it will be huge, but I think Microsoft must have calculated that it is

24:48.320 --> 24:52.160
worth the investment to make it happen on Linux.

24:52.160 --> 24:57.280
Whether or not that will be a long-term commitment, I suppose it depends how many people try it

24:57.280 --> 24:58.760
out and use it.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.560
And they must be inheriting some of the multi-platform benefit from Lync.

25:02.560 --> 25:07.120
That has to give them a lot of what it takes to get it over to Linux.

25:07.120 --> 25:09.160
And then they just have to close the gap.

25:09.160 --> 25:14.040
So I could see that as long as the upstream project continues to support Linux, Microsoft

25:14.040 --> 25:16.560
will continue to release on Linux.

25:16.560 --> 25:19.860
I don't think we can have this conversation about Edge without acknowledging that there

25:19.860 --> 25:24.720
is a generous portion in our audience that will be concerned about metric collection.

25:24.720 --> 25:27.460
They're going to be concerned about Microsoft spying on them.

25:27.460 --> 25:32.160
And it's not really an area we can speak fully to yet because a beta has additional levels

25:32.160 --> 25:35.320
of collection and metrics that may not be in a final version.

25:35.320 --> 25:39.600
But I am waiting for that inventive blogger to come up with a scenario to capture all

25:39.600 --> 25:44.160
Edge traffic for a week and parse out what is actually going back to Microsoft.

25:44.160 --> 25:48.600
It does ask you when you launch the browser, it runs you through like a first-time wizard

25:48.600 --> 25:49.600
kind of thing.

25:49.600 --> 25:53.280
And one of the things it asks you is if you want to collect details and metrics.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.040
I actually said yes.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.440
I'm not really using it a lot.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.440
I'm only going to use it for a couple of weeks.

25:58.440 --> 26:02.000
And in a way, I see that as a vote that somebody is running this on Linux.

26:02.000 --> 26:09.220
By allowing them to collect my system information, whatever that might be, even if it's semi-identifiable,

26:09.220 --> 26:12.440
what I feel like the tradeoff is is I'm voting in a sense with my wallet here.

26:12.440 --> 26:16.320
I'm saying I'm a Linux user and I'm an active Linux user who's downloaded your project and

26:16.320 --> 26:17.320
is running it.

26:17.320 --> 26:20.200
And I don't know a better way to send that signal than allowing them to collect the beta

26:20.200 --> 26:21.260
metrics for now.

26:21.260 --> 26:24.640
So I left it on, but I don't know what I would do long term.

26:24.640 --> 26:27.080
That's an area where I obviously just have a lot more comfort with Firefox.

26:27.080 --> 26:31.800
Yeah, you're saying, hey, Microsoft, I'm using this on Linux and here's my social security

26:31.800 --> 26:32.800
number.

26:32.800 --> 26:37.880
And here's my phone number, my address, and my mother's maiden.

26:37.880 --> 26:40.640
Yeah, it feels like you're doing that.

26:40.640 --> 26:41.880
Who really knows what you're sending?

26:41.880 --> 26:45.400
So I actually would love some transparency there.

26:45.400 --> 26:49.920
They've got a couple of things in here besides fonts, too, that are nice.

26:49.920 --> 26:52.200
They have pretty good integration with the Linux desktop.

26:52.200 --> 26:57.200
You can right click on the launcher icons and launch multiple instances or launch a

26:57.200 --> 26:59.760
private window like you can with full fledged Chrome.

26:59.760 --> 27:06.000
And then Microsoft has added this concept of collections, which is bookmarks, but with

27:06.000 --> 27:10.760
all of the content for the website, not just the links that saves in the browser.

27:10.760 --> 27:13.580
That's actually something I find compelling because there's a lot of times we're doing

27:13.580 --> 27:16.020
research for a show and a story changes.

27:16.020 --> 27:20.200
And I like having the original version and the updated version because not everybody

27:20.200 --> 27:21.760
actually clarifies that they updated.

27:21.760 --> 27:25.460
And with collections, I just try to suck down all the information in store and I'm an archivist

27:25.460 --> 27:26.460
in that regard.

27:26.460 --> 27:31.080
And it also is nice to have our offline purposes later.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.400
Linode.com slash land.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.800
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account.

27:35.800 --> 27:40.080
You know, Linode started in 2003 as one of the world's first companies in cloud computing.

27:40.080 --> 27:44.080
I've known about them forever, but it was only a couple of years ago I decided to actually

27:44.080 --> 27:45.560
give Linode a try.

27:45.560 --> 27:48.920
They are independently owned and founded on a love for Linux.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.960
And that became immediately obvious to me.

27:50.960 --> 27:56.040
As a longtime Linux user, it shows in various aspects of how a company operates and how

27:56.040 --> 27:57.600
they build their products.

27:57.600 --> 28:01.680
And they've supported initiatives like Kubuntu and Linux Fest Northwest and all things open

28:01.680 --> 28:03.080
for a long time.

28:03.080 --> 28:07.360
But importantly, Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing.

28:07.360 --> 28:10.440
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

28:10.440 --> 28:13.140
They have fantastic fast internet connections.

28:13.140 --> 28:16.960
They have a great dashboard that makes it easy to manage all kinds of things like your

28:16.960 --> 28:17.960
DNS.

28:17.960 --> 28:22.200
On top of various servers you can choose from, say like a $5 a month shared hosting or dedicated

28:22.200 --> 28:24.380
CPU or GPU rigs.

28:24.380 --> 28:28.120
They also have object storage, and they have all kinds of tools you can use to manage these

28:28.120 --> 28:33.120
systems to like support for Terraform or Kubernetes and object storage, which is a great way to

28:33.120 --> 28:36.360
store files in the cloud statically and link to them publicly.

28:36.360 --> 28:38.400
So check out Linode.com slash land.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.760
You get a $100 60 day credit.

28:40.760 --> 28:45.420
You can set it up for a personal server or portfolio or you can run your company infrastructure.

28:45.420 --> 28:48.640
And they're going to cost 35 to 50% less than AWS.

28:48.640 --> 28:51.040
And they started three years before AWS.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.040
So go check them out.

28:52.040 --> 28:53.040
Linode.com slash land.

28:53.040 --> 28:59.800
Well, we couldn't end my last episode any other way than with a cryptocurrency story.

28:59.800 --> 29:02.360
And I think this is a pretty big one.

29:02.360 --> 29:09.640
PayPal are going to support buying and selling and holding Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies.

29:09.640 --> 29:13.820
This has got to be the biggest Bitcoin news since the last time we talked about Bitcoin.

29:13.820 --> 29:17.200
The value of Bitcoin has shot up significantly as we record right now.

29:17.200 --> 29:22.160
It's 13,000 U.S. greenbacks, which is a big jump up because it was like below 10 not too

29:22.160 --> 29:23.620
long ago.

29:23.620 --> 29:29.320
This is both extremely frustrating and great to see.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.080
I was an early crypto coin enthusiast.

29:31.080 --> 29:32.560
I think I can claim that, right?

29:32.560 --> 29:33.680
I can make that claim.

29:33.680 --> 29:34.680
I was into crypto early.

29:34.680 --> 29:36.120
Yeah, I think so.

29:36.120 --> 29:41.760
And back then, Joe, back in my day, PayPal was an enemy of the crypto community.

29:41.760 --> 29:46.020
They were hostile towards small businesses that were trying to start up and base business

29:46.020 --> 29:48.380
around the blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

29:48.380 --> 29:50.580
They actively sought to shut them down.

29:50.580 --> 29:55.440
They were anti-competitive and it seemed like such a short sighted move because they were

29:55.440 --> 29:59.000
out of all of our quote unquote financial institutions in the U.S.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.800
They seem like the best positioned to go after cryptocurrency.

30:03.800 --> 30:08.160
It just seemed obvious because they could even if they just use it as a back end technology

30:08.160 --> 30:14.280
to actually facilitate the transactions because PayPal is a company that's mostly working

30:14.280 --> 30:17.960
with soft money where people could go and they could cancel a credit card payment and

30:17.960 --> 30:19.500
then PayPal screwed.

30:19.500 --> 30:22.760
So it just seemed natural to me that they would want to adopt something that was blockchain

30:22.760 --> 30:26.720
based that they could account for and had no take backs.

30:26.720 --> 30:29.900
But they fought it and they fought it until they could fight it no longer.

30:29.900 --> 30:35.680
And now they've announced that they will have early support, I think you could say, early

30:35.680 --> 30:36.680
support.

30:36.680 --> 30:40.480
And this eventually will extend down to even like payment services like Venmo.

30:40.480 --> 30:46.540
So it will have ramifications that reach across the industry, but it's not everything you'd

30:46.540 --> 30:47.540
hope for.

30:47.540 --> 30:50.000
Yeah, they're doing it in a very PayPal way.

30:50.000 --> 30:53.560
If you dig into what they've written about this, they have kind of an FAQ.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.480
Will PayPal support peer to peer crypto trades?

30:56.480 --> 30:58.000
Not at this time.

30:58.000 --> 31:02.920
PayPal only supports the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency using your PayPal account.

31:02.920 --> 31:08.040
To complete peer to peer transactions with PayPal, all crypto assets held with PayPal

31:08.040 --> 31:12.420
must be sold and thus converted into USD.

31:12.420 --> 31:15.720
So it's not even really properly supporting it.

31:15.720 --> 31:22.160
Yeah, you'll essentially only hold cryptocurrencies that you buy on PayPal in your PayPal account.

31:22.160 --> 31:25.760
And you won't be able to even transfer that to another PayPal account and you won't be

31:25.760 --> 31:29.200
able to pay merchants with that balance either.

31:29.200 --> 31:30.200
That's how it's going to be at first.

31:30.200 --> 31:33.720
But you have to figure to get any value out of this, they're going to have to change that

31:33.720 --> 31:34.720
down the line.

31:34.720 --> 31:35.720
Right.

31:35.720 --> 31:40.560
I think the limitations are an indication of where they are going to attempt to extract

31:40.560 --> 31:42.880
that value out of the chain.

31:42.880 --> 31:48.720
So when you transfer or when you buy something with Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency,

31:48.720 --> 31:50.080
they're going to get their cut.

31:50.080 --> 31:53.680
If you read that FAQ that you mentioned, and we'll have a good article that actually sums

31:53.680 --> 31:58.780
all this up if you don't want to read that, they're clearly wording these limitations

31:58.780 --> 32:03.740
in a way that are temporary and eventually they'll roll out additional features.

32:03.740 --> 32:07.700
But they must have a huge back end they have to sort out.

32:07.700 --> 32:12.920
Once you start high volume Bitcoin trading, it really puts a load on a database.

32:12.920 --> 32:16.000
And in their press release that announced all this, they said, quote, there are no service

32:16.000 --> 32:20.800
fees when buying or selling cryptocurrency through December 31st, 2020.

32:20.800 --> 32:24.240
And there are no fees for holding cryptocurrency in a PayPal account.

32:24.240 --> 32:27.880
What I read out of that statement is there are no service fees when buying or selling

32:27.880 --> 32:31.560
cryptocurrency right now until December 31st.

32:31.560 --> 32:34.200
After December 31st, there's going to be fees.

32:34.200 --> 32:37.260
There won't ever be fees for just letting it sit in your account.

32:37.260 --> 32:40.720
But if you want to get it in or out or buy any new stuff, there will be fees.

32:40.720 --> 32:43.200
And that's how eventually PayPal will make money off this.

32:43.200 --> 32:47.520
Yeah, there's a big yet missing from all those statements about it.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.520
They're going to have to charge fees for this.

32:49.520 --> 32:51.380
Otherwise, why are they doing it?

32:51.380 --> 32:54.760
But big picture here, I think this is going to be good to boost the cryptocurrency market.

32:54.760 --> 32:57.260
I mean, it already has brought the value up a bit.

32:57.260 --> 33:02.680
But I suspect when you take a 10 year view on digital currencies, PayPal will be the

33:02.680 --> 33:09.640
start of that 10 year view where it started bringing digital currencies to the normals.

33:09.640 --> 33:15.040
And over the next 10 years, there's going to be a couple of huge moments that make digital

33:15.040 --> 33:20.580
currency, just the phrase digital currency, a common phrase among citizens in the states.

33:20.580 --> 33:23.040
It's going to be normalized over the next decade.

33:23.040 --> 33:24.980
And it starts today with PayPal.

33:24.980 --> 33:27.520
And I know that sounds like a massive statement.

33:27.520 --> 33:31.340
But trust me, come back in 10 years and check my math on this one.

33:31.340 --> 33:34.200
I think the first step was Facebook's Libra.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.280
And this is the second one, really.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.880
Maybe I'm not sure I'm counting that one, since it seems to be a flop.

33:38.880 --> 33:45.040
If PayPal eventually rolls this out where cryptocurrency can be used to interact with

33:45.040 --> 33:49.460
their millions of merchants that they have tens and tens of millions of merchants that

33:49.460 --> 33:52.480
use PayPal, that's going to be a game changer.

33:52.480 --> 33:57.560
But I think this combined with other things that are coming down the pipe are really going

33:57.560 --> 34:02.240
to bring digital currency to the masses in a way that Facebook's Libra thing was interesting

34:02.240 --> 34:06.080
as a payment thing online, but this is going to be everyday life.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.400
Digital currency is going to be involved with everyday life.

34:08.400 --> 34:13.560
And I think the reason why this PayPal one is significant is because they see the way

34:13.560 --> 34:14.620
things are trending.

34:14.620 --> 34:17.000
They already see the way things are going and they're acting now.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.720
They're trying to get ahead of it now.

34:18.720 --> 34:20.000
And it's going to become common.

34:20.000 --> 34:24.000
And if they didn't make this move, they were just going to be left behind.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.200
And that's why when we started, I said this was inevitable.

34:26.200 --> 34:28.920
And it was frustrating to watch them fight it early on.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.720
And I'm not even sure it's good, by the way, because I know I'm going to take a lot of

34:31.720 --> 34:33.400
flack for this from the audience.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.840
I'm not saying I want to give up my cash.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.400
I'm saying it's coming.

34:37.400 --> 34:41.080
And I'm saying we'll look back at it and remember when PayPal started supporting cryptocurrencies.

34:41.080 --> 34:42.080
Oh, yeah.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.160
The move away from cash has very much started already.

34:45.160 --> 34:51.600
There's a bunch of businesses that just won't accept cash now because of the global situation.

34:51.600 --> 34:55.720
And I don't think that it'll ever come back for a lot of those businesses because cash

34:55.720 --> 34:58.760
is an expensive overhead for them.

34:58.760 --> 35:04.080
They have to count it and put it into the bank and deal with safes and all the rest

35:04.080 --> 35:05.080
of that.

35:05.080 --> 35:09.080
Whereas digital payments, if it's credit and debit cards or ultimately blockchain based

35:09.080 --> 35:12.840
systems is just so much easier for them to deal with.

35:12.840 --> 35:15.520
So we are definitely heading towards a cashless society.

35:15.520 --> 35:21.880
That is a terrible thing, but it's inevitable and cryptocurrencies are going to be some

35:21.880 --> 35:22.880
part of that.

35:22.880 --> 35:26.800
I can't tell you, though, how many times I've been working with an international contractor

35:26.800 --> 35:29.840
and we're trying to figure out what the best way to pay them is.

35:29.840 --> 35:33.640
And there's always some service that takes a cut and adds delay.

35:33.640 --> 35:38.520
And every time I'm like using PayPal or something, I think to myself, this would be so much simpler

35:38.520 --> 35:39.520
with Bitcoin.

35:39.520 --> 35:41.120
It just sends directly to them.

35:41.120 --> 35:45.320
You know, it's confirmed within 30 minutes and you've got the money.

35:45.320 --> 35:49.480
And there was, you know, if you want to pay a fee for the network to move it quicker,

35:49.480 --> 35:51.600
you can or you can opt not to.

35:51.600 --> 35:53.040
And it's just that simple.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.520
There's not three middlemen.

35:54.520 --> 35:57.720
There's not some currency conversion that has to take place.

35:57.720 --> 36:01.920
There's trusted math in between and it's from my wallet to your wallet.

36:01.920 --> 36:05.440
And then if you want to convert it to a local currency, then you may pay some sort of conversion

36:05.440 --> 36:06.440
fee.

36:06.440 --> 36:07.440
But that's up to the end user.

36:07.440 --> 36:10.520
And it just seems like such a more straightforward process.

36:10.520 --> 36:14.300
It's weird to feel that way about cryptocurrency, but when you start paying people internationally,

36:14.300 --> 36:15.600
you could see the advantage to it.

36:15.600 --> 36:18.360
Yeah, but the huge disadvantage is the volatility.

36:18.360 --> 36:22.160
Thirteen thousand dollars is to the moon, Joe.

36:22.160 --> 36:24.080
Yeah, true.

36:24.080 --> 36:27.720
I can't remember what I said it would be worth at the end of the year now, but we'll get

36:27.720 --> 36:28.720
there shortly.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.620
Well, we will see, because I'm wondering what I said, too.

36:31.620 --> 36:34.880
We'll bring you back for the end of your episode and hold you accountable and just hope that

36:34.880 --> 36:35.880
I was right.

36:35.880 --> 36:36.880
We'll see.

36:36.880 --> 36:39.280
Well, I'm not going to be completely gone.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.440
I'm going to be editing Linux Unplugged still.

36:41.440 --> 36:45.520
So I'm going to be around the network and I'm also going to be on air with my two shows,

36:45.520 --> 36:50.440
Late Night Linux and Two and a Half Admins, which is written as 2.5 admins.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.440
So check those out.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.440
Yeah.

36:52.440 --> 36:55.120
And be sure to check out the rave edition of Linux Action News coming soon with Wes

36:55.120 --> 36:56.120
Payne and myself.

36:56.120 --> 37:01.080
You can get every episode with rave music and news at linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe.

37:01.080 --> 37:03.440
Okay, maybe not the rave music part.

37:03.440 --> 37:07.480
And you can go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.560
I think I'll still be seeing those emails for a while.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.680
Yeah, probably because I just won't turn it off.

37:11.680 --> 37:12.680
We'll be back next Monday.

37:12.680 --> 37:16.040
Well, at least Wes and I will be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest

37:16.040 --> 37:17.840
Linux and open source news.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.400
You can find me at chrislass.com.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.000
And you can find me at joelress.com.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.280
Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next week.

37:24.280 --> 37:42.520
See you later.
