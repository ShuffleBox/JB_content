00:00.000 --> 00:09.860
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 227, recorded on February 9th, 2022.

00:09.860 --> 00:10.860
I'm Chris.

00:10.860 --> 00:11.860
And I'm Wes.

00:11.860 --> 00:12.860
Hello, Wes.

00:12.860 --> 00:15.000
Let's do the news.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.320
And we start this week with the industry's biggest story.

00:19.320 --> 00:26.580
That is, the collapse of the $66 billion sale of SoftBank's ARM business to NVIDIA.

00:26.580 --> 00:31.740
The deal fell through after regulators around the world raised some serious concerns about

00:31.740 --> 00:35.900
the effects on competition in the semiconductor industry.

00:35.900 --> 00:37.840
Don't feel too bad for SoftBank, though.

00:37.840 --> 00:43.600
They're going to receive a $1.25 billion breakup fee.

00:43.600 --> 00:48.640
They also still appear to have some plans to perhaps take ARM public.

00:48.640 --> 00:51.320
And there's some management upheaval in work.

00:51.320 --> 00:54.920
So I'm sure we'll see some stories about that as well.

00:54.920 --> 01:00.820
It seems a lot of people had concerns about this merger, as ARM was kind of viewed as

01:00.820 --> 01:06.840
the Switzerland of the semiconductor industry, if you will, meaning that they dealt pretty

01:06.840 --> 01:12.840
evenly with all of their 500 plus license holders, regardless of country or company.

01:12.840 --> 01:18.440
I think a quote from Greg Rowe, head of research at Hyundai Motor Securities, really emphasizes

01:18.440 --> 01:23.840
this with him saying, quote, there's a chip war going on around the world.

01:23.840 --> 01:30.360
So many weren't very welcoming of such a key architecture firm going to the US.

01:30.360 --> 01:35.380
Countries are competitively trying to build up their chip industries and will try to defend

01:35.380 --> 01:41.500
against that chip technology moving to another country.

01:41.500 --> 01:46.240
Well as the Steam Deck gets closer, we're watching the last minute developments closely.

01:46.240 --> 01:50.160
And Ferronix has the details on a new deck driver that's landed for the Linux kernel.

01:50.160 --> 01:55.440
It was posted last weekend and it's really a kitchen sink platform driver that adds support

01:55.440 --> 01:58.360
for the Steam Deck specific embedded controller in there.

01:58.360 --> 02:05.440
A controller is responsible for a whole swath of things like CPU fan control, battery temperature

02:05.440 --> 02:11.460
measurements, display related settings, even USB-C event notifications.

02:11.460 --> 02:16.520
As you might expect, this driver was developed by engineers over at Valve and specifically

02:16.520 --> 02:23.800
Andrey Smirnov, who's an engineer hired back in 2018 to work specifically on kernel projects

02:23.800 --> 02:24.800
for Valve.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.760
So it's interesting seeing that hire pay some dues here.

02:27.760 --> 02:33.080
Now given the timing of this patch, it's not expected to be merged until sometime in the

02:33.080 --> 02:38.560
Linux 5.18 cycle, which doesn't kick off until late March.

02:38.560 --> 02:43.200
But it's not actually critical functionality if you want to play around and use other Linux

02:43.200 --> 02:45.660
distributions on the deck.

02:45.660 --> 02:48.160
It's just nice to have.

02:48.160 --> 02:53.600
And Valve's Arch Linux based Steam OS is expected to be relying on a patched kernel at least

02:53.600 --> 02:55.040
initially.

02:55.040 --> 03:00.440
So all the functionality should work for early Steam Deck holders.

03:00.440 --> 03:05.180
Regardless of all those details, honestly, it's just kind of nice to see Valve getting

03:05.180 --> 03:09.600
maybe not quite ahead of the ball, but keeping up and working with upstream.

03:09.600 --> 03:14.720
I mean, that's what we expect, right?

03:14.720 --> 03:19.360
So this week, we saw the announcement of the Open Source Firmware Foundation.

03:19.360 --> 03:23.560
They're getting set up with the hopes of expanding open source firmware usage throughout the

03:23.560 --> 03:25.400
entire industry.

03:25.400 --> 03:29.920
Their founding members are Nine Element Cyber Security and Molvad VPN.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.440
Yeah, that last one's interesting.

03:32.440 --> 03:36.240
But hey, I'm a fan of open firmware, that's for sure.

03:36.240 --> 03:40.400
Now, obviously, this was just announced, so it's early days.

03:40.400 --> 03:46.800
But if you head over to osfw.foundation, you'll find that, quote, the foundation sets its

03:46.800 --> 03:53.640
goals to research and to educate corporations and individuals alike about open source firmware,

03:53.640 --> 04:00.480
through sharing intellectual resources, infrastructure, services, events, and training.

04:00.480 --> 04:05.640
The OSFF is meant to be an umbrella organization for all parties interested in open source

04:05.640 --> 04:11.280
firmware and acts as the first point of contact in the open source firmware ecosystem.

04:11.280 --> 04:15.880
Yeah, so they're really about adoption throughout the industry, right?

04:15.880 --> 04:19.360
Like, we don't see LVFS listed anywhere on here.

04:19.360 --> 04:23.320
It's not necessarily about the software bits, it's more about getting the rest of the industry

04:23.320 --> 04:25.720
to use open source firmware.

04:25.720 --> 04:29.360
But if you like your foundations, well, I got good news for you.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.920
Because FreeCAD also has a foundation.

04:31.920 --> 04:37.280
That's right, the FreeCAD project has a legal nonprofit organization around it now, Long

04:37.280 --> 04:39.240
Live FreeCAD.

04:39.240 --> 04:46.200
Well, speaking of big organizations making big changes, Intel has announced that they're

04:46.200 --> 04:52.200
joining the RISC-V international organization as a premier member.

04:52.200 --> 04:58.620
And while they already have their RISC-V based Neos V processors, Intel isn't necessarily

04:58.620 --> 05:05.200
planning anything as radical as replacing X86 with RISC-V in the short term.

05:05.200 --> 05:11.240
But it is making this move to invest in the RISC-V ecosystem for the long term.

05:11.240 --> 05:17.040
And of course, hopefully lure a few customers to the Intel Foundry services.

05:17.040 --> 05:21.700
Yeah, those Foundry services is probably what this is really about, right?

05:21.700 --> 05:26.160
But it seems like a pretty significant shift for them to double down on their investment

05:26.160 --> 05:27.280
like this.

05:27.280 --> 05:32.020
And in today's announcement, they also touch on funding some open source software development.

05:32.020 --> 05:38.380
They write, quote, today Intel announced several immediate RISC-V community benefits led by

05:38.380 --> 05:44.680
Intel's Foundry services or IFS for short, IFS will sponsor an open source software development

05:44.680 --> 05:52.680
platform that allows for freedom and experimentation, including partners across the ecosystem, universities

05:52.680 --> 05:53.840
and consortia.

05:53.840 --> 05:57.960
So it seems that Intel is making a big push here.

05:57.960 --> 06:03.080
Maybe one day we'll look at Intel as one of the premier manufacturers of RISC-V systems.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.720
I don't know.

06:04.720 --> 06:08.060
I'd love to see it.

06:08.060 --> 06:13.080
If you haven't been paying attention lately, you might have missed a major new feature

06:13.080 --> 06:20.080
that's in the works for ZFS and we happen to have an update for you this week.

06:20.080 --> 06:27.660
We first mentioned RAID-Z expansion way back in June in Linux Action News 194, but since

06:27.660 --> 06:33.740
then it seems that ZFS co-creator Matt Arends has been hard at work.

06:33.740 --> 06:39.840
For those of you that might not have listened to episode 194, one major expensive pain point

06:39.840 --> 06:47.200
of ZFS has always been its lack of support for expanding storage of an existing setup.

06:47.200 --> 06:52.760
The unofficial answer has always kind of been that hey, ZFS was built to protect your data,

06:52.760 --> 06:54.880
not do it on the cheap.

06:54.880 --> 07:00.600
RAID-Z expansion though would change all that by allowing disks to be added one at a time

07:00.600 --> 07:06.640
to an existing RAID-Z VDEV, expanding its capacity incrementally.

07:06.640 --> 07:11.600
Now that might be especially useful for those of you out there with small pools that only

07:11.600 --> 07:17.000
have one VDEV, where maybe there isn't sufficient hardware to add capacity by adding a whole

07:17.000 --> 07:24.240
new VDEV when you want to upgrade, which might involve doubling the number of disks.

07:24.240 --> 07:28.320
That's something I know we've run into while trying to plan out studio builds and either

07:28.320 --> 07:33.600
not having the disks at hand or not really having the storage capacity available.

07:33.600 --> 07:38.880
But with the new patch you'll finally be able to attach new disks to an existing RAID-Z

07:38.880 --> 07:41.320
VDEV.

07:41.320 --> 07:46.360
Whether or not that's the way you want to go, that we leave up to you.

07:46.360 --> 07:50.400
We've both been looking forward to this, and I saw that there was an update recently on

07:50.400 --> 07:55.560
the FreeBSD Foundation website, so where are we at now with this upgrade?

07:55.560 --> 08:01.200
Yeah, we did get an update there this week, because well, they're a sponsor of this work,

08:01.200 --> 08:03.600
which I'm very grateful for.

08:03.600 --> 08:07.880
And I'm also grateful that it seems like things are going quite well.

08:07.880 --> 08:13.400
All the planned capabilities have been implemented, and all the tests are passing.

08:13.400 --> 08:18.360
Now there is still some code cleanup to do, verbose logging to remove, code documentation

08:18.360 --> 08:20.920
to write, that sort of thing.

08:20.920 --> 08:26.880
But even with those remaining tasks, the aim is to have this feature integrated sometime

08:26.880 --> 08:27.880
in Q3.

08:27.880 --> 08:34.280
If you're as excited as we are, we should also note that as with many open source projects,

08:34.280 --> 08:43.840
the biggest need right now is for more help testing.

08:43.840 --> 09:06.640
I've always had an uneasy sense of the big three hyperscalers out there.

09:06.640 --> 09:11.160
I don't like all of the reasons they're in the market, I don't like how they can leverage

09:11.160 --> 09:15.880
their position to change things in the market, and I don't like their interfaces, and the

09:15.880 --> 09:19.720
sense of lock-in that I get when I try to use those big hyperscalers.

09:19.720 --> 09:24.480
And I'm not the only one, in fact devops.com just published this, 20% of developers out

09:24.480 --> 09:28.600
there believe that the big three hyperscalers are going to engage in behaviors that will

09:28.600 --> 09:31.760
leverage their brands that will stifle competition.

09:31.760 --> 09:35.840
That doesn't feel good, I don't like the way that sits.

09:35.840 --> 09:40.480
There's a lot of reasons to choose cloud providers out there, and there's a lot of cloud providers,

09:40.480 --> 09:41.880
but none of them are like Linode.

09:41.880 --> 09:46.600
They've been around for nearly 19 years, they're independently funded, they have 11 data centers

09:46.600 --> 09:50.320
around the world, and they have a real simple product.

09:50.320 --> 09:53.200
They get value out of trying to make it really good.

09:53.200 --> 09:58.280
Their whole thing is just to make a great product, back it up with the best support

09:58.280 --> 10:00.200
in the business.

10:00.200 --> 10:06.320
They're not trying to leverage their whole industrial shipping side of their business

10:06.320 --> 10:12.640
to push a cloud computing thing and subsidize it in this weird way that just isn't really

10:12.640 --> 10:14.840
a genuine product, is it?

10:14.840 --> 10:20.120
Now, I know every platform has its place, but I think Linode is one that's worth your

10:20.120 --> 10:21.340
consideration.

10:21.340 --> 10:28.360
It's incredibly powerful, it has fantastic performance, and the pricing's 30 to 50% less

10:28.360 --> 10:30.480
than some of the hyperscalers out there.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.640
And if you're an individual that just wants to do a project, you want to run a blog, have

10:34.640 --> 10:39.760
a gaming server, or maybe you're a small business, you want to do a little bit of collaboration,

10:39.760 --> 10:43.180
I really personally believe there's nothing better than Linode.

10:43.180 --> 10:51.720
So go try it out and get $100, you can really, truly kick the tires, linode.com slash lan.

10:51.720 --> 10:54.880
And of course, linux.ting.com, a big thank you to Ting.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.540
Hey, do you hear the phone ringing?

10:56.540 --> 11:00.120
It's Common Sense calling, and it's time to check out Ting.

11:00.120 --> 11:04.200
Seriously, if you live in the States, you've got to go to linux.ting.com, go see how much

11:04.200 --> 11:09.200
you could save, and then take $25 off that when you visit linux.ting.com.

11:09.200 --> 11:12.040
You see, Ting is a mobile virtual network operator.

11:12.040 --> 11:17.160
That means Ting customers get access to the big carrier networks, the nation to nation,

11:17.160 --> 11:24.240
coast to coast LTE 5G networks, but you're dealing with Ting, a reasonable company that's

11:24.240 --> 11:29.980
a reasonable size with great support, and no contracts, and there's really no other

11:29.980 --> 11:31.560
way to say it.

11:31.560 --> 11:36.360
Ting plans that just make sense, it is smarter mobile for sure.

11:36.360 --> 11:40.080
That's why I've been a customer since 2013.

11:40.080 --> 11:45.280
And every single Ting plan gets access to their award-winning customer service, nationwide

11:45.280 --> 11:49.600
LTE and 5G, and no contract ever.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.600
How great is that?

11:50.600 --> 11:53.280
Plus, I think the other thing that's really nice is you could switch to Ting in an evening.

11:53.280 --> 11:57.680
It's really simple, and because of their multi-network support, pretty much any phone's gonna work

11:57.680 --> 12:00.320
on Ting, so you might not even have to get a new phone.

12:00.320 --> 12:04.200
Head to linux.ting.com, take a look, they do offer phones directly, or you can bring

12:04.200 --> 12:05.200
your own.

12:05.200 --> 12:10.800
You put your phone info into their system, they'll tell you if it's compatible or not,

12:10.800 --> 12:15.200
likely gonna be, and when it is, they'll send you a SIM card, you pop that in, within a

12:15.200 --> 12:18.760
few minutes after you get the SIM and you get it in your phone, you're gonna be activated.

12:18.760 --> 12:22.320
Their dashboard is super straightforward, really easy, you can get everything going

12:22.320 --> 12:23.920
in minutes.

12:23.920 --> 12:30.080
When I signed up for Ting back in 2013, I think I did it at like 10.30 at night, in

12:30.080 --> 12:35.240
my home office, when everybody else was in bed, and I wouldn't have done it if I had

12:35.240 --> 12:38.680
to talk to a human, I just wanted to get it done online that night, and I got everything

12:38.680 --> 12:42.560
done online with Ting, I was really impressed, and then the couple of times where I got kind

12:42.560 --> 12:47.040
of stuck, both times when I was on a road trip actually, the Ting customer support really

12:47.040 --> 12:48.800
came through.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.280
They won't leave you stranded, they'll really take care of you, it's pretty great.

12:51.280 --> 12:55.760
So go to linux.ting.com, support the show, and take 25 bucks off what Ting's got to offer

12:55.760 --> 13:00.260
at linux.ting.com.

13:00.260 --> 13:07.560
This week, the KDE community released Plasma 5.24, a long-term support release that will

13:07.560 --> 13:12.960
receive updates and bug fixes until the final version of Plasma 5.

13:12.960 --> 13:18.000
It's been just a short four months since the previous release, 5.23, which came out in

13:18.000 --> 13:24.120
October 2021, but that shorter time frame has not stopped the project from packing this

13:24.120 --> 13:27.040
release full of goodies.

13:27.040 --> 13:30.780
Right off the top, let's mention KRunner, which is definitely one of my favorite parts

13:30.780 --> 13:32.120
of the Plasma desktop.

13:32.120 --> 13:37.840
Now, it's great and has plenty of updates in 5.24, but what really stood out to me is

13:37.840 --> 13:43.880
a new feature that teaches you all the power that exists in KRunner, because now, you can

13:43.880 --> 13:47.880
just click and explore the plugins that exist to get an idea of how you can actually use

13:47.880 --> 13:48.960
them.

13:48.960 --> 13:54.320
Also landing in 5.24 is support for fingerprint readers, well, assuming you've got all the

13:54.320 --> 13:59.760
hardware enablement bits sorted out, now Plasma will play nicely too.

13:59.760 --> 14:06.440
Discover has also gotten a bit smarter, especially around what packages it does, or crucially,

14:06.440 --> 14:12.920
does not let you uninstall, hopefully preventing folks who don't quite know what they're doing

14:12.920 --> 14:16.780
from breaking their system.

14:16.780 --> 14:21.360
Also nice to see in Discover, while it has supported Flatpaks for a long time, that support

14:21.360 --> 14:24.000
is improving in 5.24.

14:24.000 --> 14:28.360
You can now install locally downloaded Flatpak packages, and Discover will figure things

14:28.360 --> 14:34.040
out and sync up the backend repositories for those Flatpaks automatically.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.160
That is nice to see.

14:35.160 --> 14:39.400
A lot of feature improvements or tweaks are in that category of nice to see.

14:39.400 --> 14:43.720
So many that we really couldn't touch on all of them, but I did want to touch on a couple

14:43.720 --> 14:47.800
of the visual improvements, because these are equally as impressive.

14:47.800 --> 14:52.540
To give you a couple of examples here, they've tweaked the way Plasma notifications look

14:52.540 --> 14:54.120
now.

14:54.120 --> 14:58.120
Critical notifications stand out with an orange strip on the side of them to visually

14:58.120 --> 15:02.080
distinguish them from like a less urgent message.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.080
Love that.

15:03.080 --> 15:08.560
The breeze theme, always looking good, but looking absolutely great now with some nice

15:08.560 --> 15:09.640
refinements.

15:09.640 --> 15:13.920
You can now select custom accent colors, and it just looks great throughout.

15:13.920 --> 15:17.240
They've implemented the free desktop spec for dark mode.

15:17.240 --> 15:22.200
So if you have a third party application that also follows that spec, and you use dark mode,

15:22.200 --> 15:24.280
everything's going to look great.

15:24.280 --> 15:28.520
Widgets have received some nice new features, like how they get deployed and all of that.

15:28.520 --> 15:31.760
And there's been some cleanup on how you navigate all of them.

15:31.760 --> 15:38.680
On the desktop side of things, there is a nice new wallpaper in Plasma 5.24, but if

15:38.680 --> 15:42.720
you happen to prefer something else, you can now set your wallpaper pretty easily just

15:42.720 --> 15:48.120
by right clicking on any picture in Dolphin and hitting set as wallpaper.

15:48.120 --> 15:52.860
Or if you want to get a little more creative, you can use the picture of the day wallpaper

15:52.860 --> 15:58.800
plugin, which can now pull images from Simon Stollenhug's gallery, which you may recognize

15:58.800 --> 16:04.160
as a whole bunch of cool and a little bit creepy sci-fi images as seen in Tales from

16:04.160 --> 16:05.160
the Loop.

16:05.160 --> 16:10.680
Another small, but I think important visual enhancement this time around is that video

16:10.680 --> 16:16.120
notifications, that is notifications about video files, well, they now display a thumbnail

16:16.120 --> 16:21.240
of the actual video, just like you'd expect for image files.

16:21.240 --> 16:26.280
And just because maybe we have to a little bit about Wayland, the Wayland journey for

16:26.280 --> 16:32.000
Plasma is definitely a long one, but the march continues.

16:32.000 --> 16:36.240
This time around, something that stood out to me is that Spectacle, the KDE Screenshot

16:36.240 --> 16:42.000
tool, well, it finally has access to that active window mode that's been missing.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.240
And they're making good progress on catching up the keyboard shortcuts that only work in

16:46.240 --> 16:50.920
X11 and getting those gradually implemented on the Wayland side.

16:50.920 --> 16:56.020
The project obviously put a lot of care in making sure this was a really nice LTS release,

16:56.020 --> 17:00.560
but something that didn't really get listed in any of the features, but I absolutely noticed

17:00.560 --> 17:06.800
right away is this release has definitely felt faster in terms of performance on my

17:06.800 --> 17:10.240
machine than the last few releases.

17:10.240 --> 17:14.880
Like I feel like I kind of got an upgraded computer with this release, and I know I touched

17:14.880 --> 17:21.680
on it earlier, but the breeze theme is so dang good now that I keep the default theme

17:21.680 --> 17:23.680
with Plasma.

17:23.680 --> 17:30.200
Like you go back like maybe a year and a half, and the first thing I was doing on a new Plasma

17:30.200 --> 17:34.800
desktop was tweaking the theme and the way it looks and spending a couple of hours getting

17:34.800 --> 17:36.080
that right.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.760
And now, now I'm using the defaults.

17:38.760 --> 17:42.820
It feels like the team has just put a ton of work into that kind of stuff.

17:42.820 --> 17:46.600
And so all in all, this just feels like a release that is absolutely worth checking

17:46.600 --> 17:47.600
out.

17:47.600 --> 17:52.080
It is available via Plasma Neon right now, that's how I tried it out earlier, and it'll

17:52.080 --> 17:54.620
be coming to a distro near you soon.

17:54.620 --> 17:57.560
