00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,400
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,240
This is episode seven, recorded on June 25th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,240
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,240
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,560
This week, big week for Linux graphics.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,080
Multimedia on Linux got some big news, and we're going to dig into some of it.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,560
But let's start with the Ubuntu desktop weekly update.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,400
This is something that's been happening on a regular basis, and there's a few juicy nuggets

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,400
in here.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,760
Yeah, there are a couple of things here.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,880
The first one is that Unity 7 is going to be in 17.10.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,660
At least it's going to be available as an option to install, which they are currently

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,020
working on in the daily images.

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,960
So you can now get Unity 7 as well as GNOME, which is obviously the default.

16
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,280
And that's not huge news.

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,800
We kind of expected this, but it is good to see because there are a lot of people who

18
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,720
are going to miss Unity.

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,180
And it's not Unity 8.

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,180
It's not the mere stuff.

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,520
It's not all the convergence stuff that we were hoping for.

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,120
But it is good old trusty Unity 7, which I personally am not a huge fan of.

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,500
But I know that probably listening to the show are thousands of people who are using

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,800
Unity on a daily basis and are really sad to see it go and will reluctantly switch to

25
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
GNOME.

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,440
So this is going to make that transition that little bit easier, isn't it?

27
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,440
Absolutely.

28
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,960
So the big takeaway from this bit is you're going to be able to have both GNOME and the

29
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,080
Unity desktop session side by side.

30
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,620
So what they did here was they migrated Ubuntu session to GNOME, and now they've created

31
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,260
a new Unity session.

32
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:48,260
So now we have two separate sessions that will be available at the login screen if you

33
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,420
install all the corresponding packages.

34
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:56,760
And in traditional open source geek style, I am now loving Unity 7 more than ever now

35
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,080
that they've announced they're killing it.

36
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,900
But I want to talk about the update in here that I think is going to have a huge impact

37
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,560
long term on multimedia playback on the Linux desktop.

38
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,840
They're working on hardware accelerated video decoding and a proof of concept using Gstreamer.

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:18,480
Yeah, and this is going to mean potentially 4K H.264 video using only 3% of a CPU if you've

40
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,240
got Haswell or newer, which is amazing, isn't it?

41
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,560
At the moment, if you're trying to run 4K video, it uses a ton of CPU and your computer

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,560
can't really do much else unless it is ridiculously fat and beefy.

43
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,120
So that is amazing.

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,120
And 4K H.265 will be available on Skylake or later.

45
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,800
That's good timing for that because that's going to get more and more implementation

46
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
over 2018.

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,580
Yeah, this, I can't really understate this.

48
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,760
This is huge.

49
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,720
In my benchmarking, I recently had some just unbelievably powerful Linux hardware in the

50
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,880
studio for benchmarking.

51
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,720
So very fresh results.

52
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:03,880
I was able to get smoother, better playback on a 2013 MacBook Pro than on the most latest

53
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:11,400
totally high end Linux workstation with Xeon CPUs, workstation grade graphics, PCIe storage.

54
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:19,740
It struggled to play back 60 frames per second 4K H.264 video while the MacBook Pro 2013

55
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,040
could smoke through the footage because of hardware acceleration.

56
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,580
And this is becoming a limiting factor for video editors on Linux.

57
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,200
And so it's great to see Canonical doing this in Ubuntu because even just being able to

58
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,320
play back the footage is a huge win.

59
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,080
So you think that this is going to feed into video editors, potentially Kdenlive and that

60
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,080
sort of thing?

61
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,200
I certainly hope so.

62
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,420
They all have different ways of utilizing system codecs, but a huge part of being able

63
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:47,000
to work with the footage on the Linux desktop is the fact that it just struggles to even

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,500
play it back, let alone edit it.

65
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,800
So this will fix the play it back aspect of it.

66
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,720
So if you check the link in the show notes, you can figure out how to get it working now

67
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,280
on your system.

68
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,880
But the plan is to hopefully have this land in 1710.

69
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,260
It's all proof of concept right now, but you can tell I'm watching this with some serious

70
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,260
interest.

71
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,280
Yeah, let's hope that it's working and completely stable in 1804, the next LTS.

72
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,320
And I really hope that other distros can take this work and implement it there as well.

73
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,880
I'm going to see if I can't retrofit my review and install this proof of concept and do an

74
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,440
A-B difference between software accelerated playback and hardware accelerated, although

75
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,840
I bet our audience knows it's a huge difference.

76
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Yeah.

77
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,760
Okay, well, something that I wanted to quickly flag up was the Foronix 2017 Linux Laptop Survey,

78
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:41,080
which is only a few questions on Google Form, but I think that it's important to have our

79
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,320
say as a Linux community on what we want from a Linux laptop and what we've got now.

80
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:55,080
And the information that you can give them anonymously is potentially going to help the

81
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
market out.

82
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,280
It's going to prove that we want certain things and certain things are important.

83
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,840
Is battery life more important to you or performance or build quality, that sort of thing?

84
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:12,000
There's loads of questions here and I've taken the survey and so I think everyone should

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,960
do that and hopefully the industry can take note of the results.

86
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,160
So not only is this going to be useful for manufacturers creating laptops, but I'm interested

87
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,780
in it from a Linux user's perspective.

88
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,880
Are people going with pre-built Linux rigs, shipping with Linux, or are they still blazing

89
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,180
their own trail and buying hardware that isn't necessarily designed for Linux, but making

90
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,180
it work?

91
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,640
I think this survey will suss that out as well.

92
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,840
And then it's also asking people, like, what kind of issues do you run into these days

93
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,080
with your trackpad?

94
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,120
Are you trying to put these on Macbooks?

95
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,240
They're also trying to suss out things like touchpad issues, Wi-Fi, and battery life like

96
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,840
Joe mentioned, but something else that caught my attention in the survey, this is the first

97
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,360
time I've seen Solus show up on the survey.

98
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,640
I'm really going to be interested to see what the results are that come back on that.

99
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,180
The other thing I like about this is, first of all, Feronix is sort of a neutral third

100
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,180
party in this.

101
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,320
They don't build a laptop, they don't sell any hardware, and they have a pretty solid

102
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,160
background with open benchmarking, where some of this might be interesting to cross-connect

103
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,440
the data of the results from the survey with the machines that have been benchmarked on

104
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,000
open benchmark, and maybe we could kind of get a sense of the average compute power of

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
the Linux community.

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
At least they're laptops.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,100
Yeah, yeah.

108
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:29,400
So the last question is, what would you like to see in a dream Linux laptop?

109
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,680
So I'll have to ask, what did you put for that one?

110
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,880
I don't know if I actually answered that question, because the XPS 13 and the Galago Pros out

111
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,840
there, they're getting pretty damn close.

112
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,800
And I kind of feel now with the XPS 13 in particular, they just keep revving on that,

113
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,640
and it's pretty close to perfect within today's market realities.

114
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:54,840
Okay, because I said 100% FOSS, including the BIOS, that is the dream for me.

115
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
You idealist, Joe.

116
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,920
Well, you've got a dream, haven't you?

117
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,240
I totally agree.

118
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,180
And if I was dreaming, I would say yes.

119
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,520
When I think of the ideal Linux laptop, I think of one I can actually buy en masse today.

120
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,320
That's kind of what I think of, and there's just some compromises.

121
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,160
Now ask me again in five years, maybe it would be a different answer.

122
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,440
Well, they said dream, so I dream big.

123
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,560
What can I say?

124
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,920
Speaking of dreams, some of those dreams got crushed when Yala failed to deliver a tablet

125
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
running their alternative OS.

126
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:30,000
We have a bit of an update for those of you still waiting for your refund, and it looks

127
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,240
like some good news for Yala down the road too.

128
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,720
Yeah, this was a tablet that they promised to ship by the second quarter of 2015, and

129
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,520
the crowd funder for it was in early 2015.

130
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,160
And they ran out of money.

131
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,600
The investments that they were promised never materialized, and they almost went bankrupt.

132
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,000
And so they promised to refund people's money.

133
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,920
Well they refunded about half of people's money and then promised that they would give

134
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,920
them the other half at some point.

135
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:15,600
Well we've now had a post on their blog saying basically that they are still hoping to give

136
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,720
people their refunds but making no promises, which it just doesn't look good.

137
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
It's awkward.

138
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
It's really awkward.

139
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,880
So this has been a few years in now.

140
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:30,160
I mean I remember covering this back in, I mean years ago, 2015 earlier in the Linux

141
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
action show.

142
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,440
And so now here we are in Linux action news and we're getting to the news of the refunds.

143
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,960
Now it starts, like I said, awkwardly because they go into how things are going good because

144
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:51,000
they're making positive progress towards major business deals with Sailfish in China and

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Russia.

146
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,480
Yeah, which is their business model now, licensing out Sailfish OS.

147
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,800
Yeah, yeah.

148
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,800
And if those projects go big time, like they think they might, then they're going to start

149
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,160
having a steady income of money.

150
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,720
And they think once that happens, then they're going to stabilize their business over time.

151
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:15,920
And once these things start to coalesce, they then plan to come up with a way of giving

152
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,080
a cut of the revenues back towards the customers who funded them.

153
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,640
So they say they're going to take a phased approach to refund and they're going to execute

154
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,840
refunds every month the company makes a positive cash flow from its core business, Sailfish

155
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,200
OS licensing.

156
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,740
Let's parse that for a second.

157
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,680
They're going to execute refunds every month that the company makes positive cash flow.

158
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,400
So not every month, but just every month that they have positive cash flow from its core

159
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,200
business, which is Sailfish.

160
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,440
So if they start swag or business consulting or integration services with hardware manufacturers,

161
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,280
those separate revenue streams are not applicable to this deal.

162
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,360
Yeah.

163
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,480
And also they're going to give out these refunds randomly, which doesn't seem right.

164
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,680
Maybe they should do it in the order that people pledged.

165
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,720
If you jump straight on it, maybe you should get your refund before people who pledged

166
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
after you.

167
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,400
Now let me play devil's advocate here.

168
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,400
In a world where everybody wants to see a strong Android competitor and wants to see

169
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,840
something like Sailfish OS be successful, we have to acknowledge that the company that

170
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,320
is driving that the strongest has to be successful.

171
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,640
And we don't want to bleed them dry with refunds because the money that they are refunding

172
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,440
is truly from fans who wanted to see this be successful in the long term anyway.

173
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,960
People who are willing to go in on Indiegogo are doing so because they believe in the vision

174
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,600
or the mission of the thing they're backing.

175
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,180
In this case, Sailfish OS or Yala, you get my drift here.

176
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:55,960
In some sense, they can afford to trickle refund their biggest fans because those biggest

177
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,520
fans have a core belief in the bigger vision.

178
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,640
I suppose so.

179
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,280
And ultimately, I would like to see it succeed because of all of the various mobile operating

180
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,760
systems that I've tried, I think that Sailfish is the best.

181
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:16,280
I used it for a couple of weeks when Martin Wimpress, Wimpy lent me his old Yala phone

182
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,420
and I was really impressed with it and that was a good couple of years ago.

183
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,640
So I can only assume, I haven't actually tried it out for a while, but I can only assume

184
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:29,320
that it is much better now and it was already really good then.

185
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,880
So I really want them to succeed and I suppose, yeah, that you don't want them to be bled

186
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
dry.

187
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,640
That is a good point that if they liquidated all their assets and just basically bankrupted

188
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,880
themselves by paying back these backers on Indiegogo.

189
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
The dream's dead.

190
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,880
Yeah.

191
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,960
And I suppose also, you're not buying something on Indiegogo, are you?

192
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,840
You are pledging a donation and you get a reward for that, which there's no guarantee

193
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
of.

194
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,840
A tablet or anything like this on Indiegogo always seems like a moonshot to me.

195
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
Yeah, I agree.

196
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,960
I mean, I have a rule that I'm not going to put any money into crowdfunding that I can't

197
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,360
afford to lose.

198
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:15,360
And so that's why the GPD Pocket, for example, I really wanted it and stuff, but I just wasn't

199
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,720
willing to risk the money.

200
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,680
I think they will deliver and it's looking like they are starting to deliver that.

201
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,320
But something that's a few hundred dollars.

202
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
I completely echo that.

203
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,440
I completely agree.

204
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,200
That's now my philosophy with crowdfunding too.

205
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,360
And honestly, Joe, it was some of these crowdfundings like the one that Yala did that sort of taught

206
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,160
us those hard lessons.

207
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,720
Yeah, exactly.

208
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,280
But well, here's hoping that they do make some money and be successful.

209
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,200
And as you say, be a genuine competitor to Android, even if it's not completely open

210
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
source.

211
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,000
Well, neither is Android.

212
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,640
And if we had something that was really good and could compete with Android, at least in

213
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,600
a niche of the market, that would be better than just having this duopoly that we've got

214
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,200
now.

215
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,340
Last.ting.com.

216
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:08,600
That's where you go to support the show and get $25 off a device or $25 in Ting credit

217
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,140
if you bring a device.

218
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:15,180
I've been on the Ting network for years and one of the devices I ran was the Nexus 5 and

219
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,960
I put Sailfish OS on there.

220
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,420
This is what I love about Ting is they'll give you a GSM SIM, you put that in the device

221
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,420
you want.

222
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,840
And they have supported devices that their support people know all about.

223
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:28,400
And of course, that's always a great way to go for anyone that's just looking for a simple

224
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,880
to use cellular plan.

225
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
But me?

226
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,880
No, I got to make things hard.

227
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,280
I got to flash ROMs on my Nexus 5 and Sailfish OS, it rocked because Ting doesn't have an

228
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
agenda.

229
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
They don't block certain OSs.

230
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,000
They don't block updates to your phone.

231
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,120
They just give you simple mobile for $6 a line.

232
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,760
It's your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

233
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,320
Whatever you use, Ting adds it up and that's all you pay.

234
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,600
Start by going to last.ting.com and get nationwide coverage with no contracts, no early termination

235
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,580
fees, and you only pay for what you use.

236
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:01,720
It's really how the mobile industry would do it today if they had to start all over.

237
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
last.ting.com.

238
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,440
Go there, also check out their blog, great post recently, last.ting.com and thanks to

239
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,280
Ting for sponsoring the Linux Action News.

240
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:20,120
Well, let's talk about Mozilla and firstly, Firefox Focus, their new browser for Android,

241
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,160
which was available sort of iOS before, but we don't really care about that or at least

242
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
I don't.

243
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,160
I know you do.

244
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:37,520
So it's a very simple little browser that is focused completely on privacy and by the

245
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,600
looks of things, speed as well, because I tried this out today and that is the first

246
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,700
thing that jumped out at me.

247
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,480
This is the fastest browser I have ever used on Android.

248
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Really?

249
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
That's cool.

250
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Yeah.

251
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,520
So it allows you to browse the web and they say, quote unquote, without being tracked

252
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,280
by ads and you know, it's funny you mentioned the speed.

253
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,160
I was really curious, Joe, like how are they building this?

254
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:07,000
Because this is Mozilla and on iOS, they really just kind of ended up wrapping WebKit and

255
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,160
using that and that was like, it was essentially it was a WebKit browser, but with the Firefox

256
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,660
Focus take on it, I thought, okay, well for Android, surely, surely they're using Gecko.

257
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,440
And so I did a little digging and I dug around and I have a link in the show notes in the

258
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,680
Firefox Focus source code.

259
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,800
And it looks like at build time, they allow you to build it with either a Gecko back end

260
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,480
or a WebKit back end.

261
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,560
And for the version they're shipping on the Play Store, it's built with the WebKit back

262
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,560
end.

263
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,020
Actually, it's using Android WebView.

264
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,020
So WebKit.

265
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,020
Right.

266
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,900
That explains why it's fast then.

267
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,900
Isn't that interesting though?

268
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,880
Mozilla is essentially shipping a WebKit browser on both mobile platforms now.

269
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:51,680
Yeah, but to be fair, in this Firefox Focus, there is an option to open this page in Firefox.

270
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:58,120
So if you've got the main big version of Firefox as well, then you can open it in Gecko.

271
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,040
But that is interesting that they're shipping WebKit.

272
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,740
The thing is that it's very limited.

273
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:10,320
It's incredibly fast and it seemed to block pop ups and stuff really, really well.

274
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,080
But I found that a fair bit of JavaScript didn't work in it, and also you've got a single

275
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
tab.

276
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,780
Well, so they have a note in here.

277
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,740
They say, for Android users, we've also made Focus a great default browser experience since

278
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,720
we support both custom tabs and the ability to disable ad blocking.

279
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Custom tabs, Joe.

280
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,760
What the hell is custom tabs?

281
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,920
It's not very clear because then they list one of the features is no tabs.

282
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,920
I don't understand.

283
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,920
Yeah.

284
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,920
I didn't get that either.

285
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,920
It's very strange.

286
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,680
There's a couple other standout features for the Android version versus the iOS version,

287
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,520
which I thought maybe be worth mentioning.

288
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,740
I like this one.

289
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,680
There's an ad tracker counter.

290
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,480
So just for the curious, they're going to just count a little number of the amount of

291
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
ads that they've blocked per site.

292
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
That could be brutal.

293
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,280
Yeah, I saw that, which, yeah, you can see some sites are just going way overboard.

294
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,280
I mean, I have got a host file anyway.

295
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:09,560
I use Addaway from F-Droid, and that updates your host file and just blocks most adverts.

296
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,800
So, with that and Firefox Focus, you basically don't see any adverts.

297
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,800
It's brilliant.

298
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,040
If they just added tabs to it, I'd be using it all the time, I think, as my main browser.

299
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,680
They say here at the end of the post that they're going to be adding new features that

300
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,920
make it even better down the road.

301
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,840
So maybe tabs is one of them.

302
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
Yeah.

303
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,600
Well, I installed this to check it out for the show, thinking that, well, after the show,

304
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,600
I'll uninstall it.

305
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,400
But this is staying on my phone, man.

306
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,400
I completely agree.

307
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
I keep it, too.

308
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,240
It's really nice to just have something that's totally divorced from the vendor that has

309
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,480
nothing to do with Google or Apple.

310
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,640
And I trust Mozilla.

311
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
And I think it's even more legitimate on Android.

312
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,120
It's kind of funny that it came to iOS first.

313
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,400
And they quoted some sort of statistic where it was very well reviewed on iOS.

314
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,880
It's good to see it coming to Android, too.

315
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,160
Yeah, I look forward to seeing the updates for it.

316
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,600
So something else that Mozilla is working on that might immortalize your voice.

317
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,760
Yeah, Project Common Voice, which they say is a project to help make voice recognition

318
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,440
open to everyone.

319
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:14,240
So we all know about the various big companies with their voice recognition in their digital

320
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,240
assistants.

321
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,520
Well, Mozilla is at least attempting here to make something that is open source that

322
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,120
can be used by various projects, maybe even Mycroft.

323
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,800
You never know.

324
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,320
And they're basically crowdsourcing the voice input for that, because the thing that you

325
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:36,400
need with any voice recognition system is a ton of data to work with.

326
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,640
And they give you a really simple walkthrough sentence you can read and then upload to their

327
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
servers.

328
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,640
I'm probably using WebRTC.

329
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,360
I didn't try it, but I did play some of their samples, and it's a neat idea.

330
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm sure Popey's over there submitting tons of different voices.

331
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yeah.

332
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Well, I did.

333
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,320
I read the three sentences that it wanted and also listened to five.

334
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,320
And you can validate them.

335
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,840
You can say yes or no.

336
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,800
And a couple of them were wrong, so I ticked no.

337
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,760
So hopefully that can make it learn a little bit more.

338
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,440
So I would say that if you've got five minutes or even less than that, then go to voice.mozilla.org

339
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,560
and help them out, because it's something that we can all potentially benefit from.

340
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,380
I completely agree.

341
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:23,640
So back to multimedia on Linux desktop, Opus 1.2 saw a major release this week, which has

342
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,860
many quality improvements, new features, and bug fixes.

343
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:34,680
So when I first heard about this, I was thinking, well, MP3 has just been freed from patents.

344
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,120
And we've got Ogg Vorbis.

345
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,160
So do we really need improvements to this?

346
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,700
But then thinking about it, it's not really, I don't think, aimed at necessarily listening

347
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,100
to podcasts or music directly.

348
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:55,440
It's more that people can embed this codec in their applications.

349
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,120
And so users will see a benefit without even knowing about it, probably.

350
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
Yes, absolutely.

351
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,200
And I think they have made improvements, ironically, that make it better for music.

352
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,200
But I think one of the most notable improvements in this release are going to be some of the

353
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,940
speech quality improvements.

354
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,680
They come from something they call a hybrid mode.

355
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,240
Hybrid mode is when the Cilk codec is used to encode speech frequencies up to 8 kilohertz.

356
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,920
And then CELT, a different codec, kicks in, which is used on frequencies from 8 kilohertz

357
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,640
all the way up to 20 kilohertz.

358
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,520
So this hybrid mode allows Cilk and CELT to be used for their more appropriate frequency

359
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,240
ranges and combine it into one stream, which is going to sound fantastic.

360
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,760
So do you think there's any chance of music and podcasts moving over to using Opus instead

361
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,060
of MP3 and AAC?

362
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,520
If I was going to put on the idealist hat for a moment, I would say yes.

363
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:50,720
But in reality, if you look at statistics, M4A, which is based on AAC, is a notable improvement

364
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:58,240
over MP3 and has like a 0.9% MP3 market share, based on some stats I've heard from major

365
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
podcast players.

366
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,840
Yeah, MP3 is the name you know.

367
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,980
It's the VHS, isn't it?

368
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,800
It's not the best, but it's just what has won.

369
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:13,600
Yeah, it's a universal format that plays on everything from televisions to workout wristbands.

370
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,960
Yeah, you buy a cheap Chinese MP3 player for like, you can get them for $1 now, I think,

371
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,880
for an MP3 player with like 8 gigs of storage or something.

372
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,720
Absolutely unbelievable.

373
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,080
That's going to play MP3s all the way up to the highest end smartphone.

374
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,560
It's just everywhere.

375
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,680
I think this is going back to your core point, why Opus is really great for telecommunications

376
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,600
or things like Mumble or WebRTC communication, where it's an infrastructure-level codec

377
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,760
that people are just going to notice things sound great, and maybe down-the-road podcasters

378
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,600
won't do double-ended recordings because the internet codec will be just so incredible,

379
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
thanks to Opus.

380
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:55,080
But back at home, in the consumer world, things like MP3 and JPEGs stick because there's a

381
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,680
larger problem here.

382
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:01,880
Not only is it just consumer awareness, but there's also the thing we don't talk about.

383
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,140
This digital stuff is ephemeral, and it can just go away.

384
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:10,480
And backwards compatibility of something that lasts more than 10 years is extremely valuable

385
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
in our lives.

386
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,080
And as a parent, I have JPEGs from like 8 years ago, and I want to be able to open those

387
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,180
JPEGs in 40 years from now.

388
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,260
And I have audio recordings in MP3 that I want to play in 40 years.

389
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:23,640
So there is some real value to some of these formats that stick, even if it's not their

390
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,760
compression or their sound quality, but just having access to them matters.

391
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:35,760
Yeah, for example, my dad did some writing about 20 years ago on an old Mac using Clarus

392
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,200
Works, if you remember that.

393
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,200
And I got the hard drive out, I had to get a SCSI adapter and stuff.

394
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,400
And this was about five years ago, maybe.

395
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,360
So it had only been 15 years since he'd written those.

396
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,800
And I was really struggling.

397
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:55,580
In the end, I found an online, I can't even remember what it was now, service that converted

398
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,080
them to dot doc or something.

399
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,400
Oh, very good.

400
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,520
So I did manage to do it, but maybe I'd struggle now to do it.

401
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,520
I don't know.

402
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,800
But as you say, if that data is there in a format that is unreadable by modern machines.

403
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Yeah.

404
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,980
And of course, eventually, you're going to want to move from dot doc to something like

405
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,980
ODF.

406
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,320
And going back to Opus for a moment, that's why these core open source formats really

407
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,320
matter.

408
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,280
You can see Opus, I believe, get implemented into more core technologies.

409
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,000
And they have a really cool demo, which we'll have linked in the show notes if you scroll

410
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,080
down the page a bit.

411
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:33,480
They have an example of MP3 compared to Opus 1.0, and then 1.1, and now the new 1.2 release,

412
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,060
and then versus uncompressed.

413
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,560
The full range, you can really get a sense of how the project's matured, and how it really

414
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,080
compares to MP3, and how great it is.

415
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,880
It's a really clever idea.

416
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,800
And it's a way to show off your work that only an audio codec could, and that's linked

417
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
in the show notes.

418
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,920
So does that mean we're going to hear, this is an example of Opus, a compression codec

419
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,480
used specifically for speech?

420
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,800
Joe, I certainly hope so, and I hope it sounds just like that.

421
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,280
And in the meantime, you'll have to stay tuned to find out.
