00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,960
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,680
This is episode 23, recorded on October 15th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,680
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,680
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,680
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,680
It's good to be with you again.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,240
We have so many things to get into, a good range of topics today.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,680
Let's start with one that affects a lot of us that use Steam under Linux, and that's

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,160
sort of like hodgepodge mismatched support for different games.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,120
And sometimes they rely on outdated libraries.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,480
And sometimes when you try to use native libraries, things don't work quite well.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,800
And we've just been waiting for somebody to come along and potentially solve this mess

13
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,800
of a problem.

14
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,320
Well, Solus has been the go to platform for a lot of Steam users on Linux, I understand,

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,120
because iKey has been really pushing the envelope in that area.

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,520
And now, thanks to snaps, it's getting a little bit easier to do that.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
You mentioned snaps.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,800
Let's talk about base snaps.

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,200
This is something new as of SnapD 2.28.

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,340
I'm not an expert in this, but I'll reframe the conversation to give you a perspective.

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,400
Let's say you created an application that, for whatever reason, really just runs on Fedora

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,840
25.

23
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,880
And a use case comes up where you need to run that on Arch Linux.

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,480
You can now create a snap of the application and a base snap of Fedora 25.

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,400
That's sort of like a Fedora 25 runtime environment.

26
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,520
Now, if you're on a system that doesn't have that runtime environment, you can have this

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,240
application snap that requires that base.

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,680
And it pulls it down and installs it, and the application runs as expected.

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,120
But if you were to install that same snap on a Fedora 25 system, it wouldn't necessarily

30
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,240
need that base snap.

31
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,160
So they can be separate pieces.

32
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:52,080
And what Solus is doing is they're creating the Linux Steam integration project using

33
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:57,360
a strict Linux Stream integration intercept module, which sounds like a ninja move.

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,900
Yeah, and it means that every other distribution that's using snaps can benefit from the work

35
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:06,240
that iKey and the rest of the Solus team have put in.

36
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,120
And now it means that you know Steam is going to work 100% on any distro with snaps.

37
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,840
So will developers end up targeting this?

38
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Who knows?

39
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
It's early days right now.

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,880
But actually, I can say this.

41
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,760
This is doubling down on what Solus has been great at, fixing problems around Steam and

42
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,160
then doing it in a way that solves it once and for all and makes it available for all

43
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,440
Linux distributions.

44
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,520
And I really want to underscore that point is both this and their previous Steam work

45
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,880
feels like the type of design work that goes into this, the type of design work that makes

46
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,600
this a problem solved for once type thing.

47
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,880
And that's going to result in easier, better gameplay on Linux if this is successful.

48
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,440
So that's why I think it's worth looking at.

49
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,480
If you haven't seen it yet, we'll have a link in the show notes.

50
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,320
Go over to linuxactionnews.com slash 23.

51
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,160
And you'll see it's one of our top links.

52
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,160
Read about it.

53
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,680
And you can get it going on your distribution now if you support snaps, which you probably

54
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
do.

55
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,320
Yeah, it's almost like Valve should have done this in the first place.

56
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,120
But it's been left to the community and the community has stepped up.

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,440
So yeah, well done Ikea and Solus for pushing that forward.

58
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,360
So you mentioned Fedora in there.

59
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,480
Well Fedora Workstation 27 is going to have AAC support.

60
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,760
Well kind of AAC is the modern replacement for mp3.

61
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,320
No one's using mp3 anymore, right?

62
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,840
Hang on, you're listening to one now.

63
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,000
But if the Fraunhofer organization had to be believed, then mp3 is dead and AAC is the

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
future.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,520
So I suppose it's a very good thing that Fedora is going to be supporting it.

66
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,960
But I say kind of because it's not every single implementation of it.

67
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,120
But at least some AAC files will now play going forward in Fedora.

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,280
My takeaway is the most common AAC files will be supported by Fedora.

69
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,060
This is based on an implementation released by Google.

70
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,440
And one of the things that Fedora is doing here that's kind of nice is they're also going

71
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,520
to be releasing GStreamer plugins.

72
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,140
So applications that use the GStreamer playback engine will just get AAC support once you

73
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,640
go to Fedora 27.

74
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,640
No additional work required.

75
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,220
This change does not mean that you can package and ship any AAC implementation you want in

76
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,220
Fedora though.

77
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,000
You will have to look into their specific implementation here.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yeah, it's kind of future proofing, isn't it?

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,560
Because mp3 is still around for now, but it might not be forever.

80
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,720
They also tease Joe that there may be more other major quote unquote codec announcements

81
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,720
soon.

82
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
So stay tuned.

83
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Yeah.

84
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
I wonder what's coming there.

85
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,720
Hmm.

86
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
Hmm.

87
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
I doubt it's anything really.

88
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,360
I have to say at this point, if we have mp3 and AAC, I think that pretty much covers all

89
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,000
of the proprietary audio codecs, but maybe I'll be proven wrong.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,440
Maybe it's video.

91
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,440
That would be very cool.

92
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,440
That would be very cool.

93
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
All right.

94
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,680
Well, you have had all sorts of problems with GNOME in the studio and people keep suggesting

95
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,440
various replacements for it.

96
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:01,880
And you have said to me that you want to have one desktop environment, one unified experience

97
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,520
across all your machines.

98
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,920
Well, how about plasma 5.11?

99
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,960
Yeah, the new release by our friends over at KDE.

100
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,140
Plasma 5.11 has a bunch of new features.

101
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:19,480
Probably the most standout ones are the settings app and the most popular one is improved notifications,

102
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,480
including notification history.

103
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,840
I didn't realize how popular that was until I started getting emails about it.

104
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,520
I like the new task manager.

105
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,320
I think that's maybe my favorite new feature.

106
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,760
And this release also includes the new vault system, which, quote, allows users to encrypt

107
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,120
open sets of documents in a secure and user-friendly way.

108
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,640
So that might be something I have to play with as well.

109
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,360
And it lets you hide them away as well.

110
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,080
So if someone comes to your machine, they don't even know those files are there necessarily.

111
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,080
Yeah.

112
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,080
Yeah, that is nice.

113
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
Yeah.

114
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,280
I think that is probably, I just got to read up on how it's implemented.

115
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,440
And I like so many things about the plasma desktop, Joe.

116
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
So many things about it.

117
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,120
But yet, it feels like more than what I need for my day-to-day desktop.

118
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,960
And there's still some visual inconsistencies for me that I find to be distracting.

119
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,280
And on top of that, I almost need, what would be perfect is if somebody could rebase the

120
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,520
Neon Projects desktop in this really perfectly set up environment and then lock it all down

121
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,940
so I can't change it.

122
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,400
Because otherwise, I just sit there and fiddle with it all day long.

123
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,280
And I would never get any podcasting done, Joe.

124
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,680
Well, you know there is such a thing as self-control, where you just don't go into the settings

125
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
and change things.

126
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
Mm-hmm.

127
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,680
Yeah, yeah.

128
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
I've heard that before.

129
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,920
I'm not familiar with it, but I've heard that before.

130
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:40,480
So they have something sort of in play, I will say, for 5.12.

131
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,940
And I think if they don't nail this, then they're going to miss the boat.

132
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,160
And so I would encourage everybody who wants to see Plasma better on Wayland to get involved.

133
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,800
Because they're shooting for an awesome release on Wayland with Plasma 5.12.

134
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,600
And the elephant in the room is that 5.12 is due to be the long-term support version

135
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,840
of the Plasma desktop.

136
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,640
So it's kind of important to nail the Wayland support on this one.

137
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,920
Yeah, it would have been kind of important to nail it pre that, you would have thought.

138
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,320
Like Ubuntu are doing with 17.10, they're getting Wayland in there one release before

139
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
the LTS.

140
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
You might think that.

141
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Yeah.

142
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,120
And it's getting there, slightly but surely, but as you say, this is very important for

143
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
them.

144
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,280
As the LTS, they need to get Wayland working properly.

145
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,480
So it's no wonder that the K-Win maintainer, Martin Fleurza, I think, has put out this

146
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:38,340
call to get people to test it, and hack on it, and contribute, and just make sure that

147
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,080
Wayland is working well.

148
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,640
Because we seem to be moving very rapidly towards a post-X world at this point.

149
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,780
Yeah, I mean, that definitely seems to be a lot of the ducks, as they say, are getting

150
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,260
lined up.

151
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:55,200
But I do feel like this will be looked back on as an effort that was implemented too little,

152
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,800
too late, because I feel one of the things we are learning very hard with Wayland right

153
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:06,240
now is scale and use cases, like esoteric use cases, like edge cases, I guess would

154
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,340
be the phrase, are really what make the difference.

155
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:12,920
And until you have a lot of those, and until you have hundreds of thousands, if not millions

156
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,240
of those, you're not really testing Wayland.

157
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,680
And so the sooner that these projects get this code into people's hands for testing,

158
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,980
the more and more esoteric edge cases get pushed.

159
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:32,240
And I was sitting in a room, not to keep going back to this, in New York at the Ubuntu rally,

160
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,560
where they were pulling up the bug tracker for Wayland, and it's hitting historical landmarkers

161
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,240
for the Ubuntu project, in number of bugs being submitted to the project in the entire

162
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,520
history of Ubuntu.

163
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,120
Because they, by right now, just having people beta testing 17.10, have more people using

164
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,800
Wayland than apparently have been ever using Wayland before.

165
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,920
And they're discovering so many more bugs because of that.

166
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:05,280
So it's quaint to suggest that a niche of the Plasma Desktop users should try really

167
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:12,260
hard to make Wayland support great in 5.12, and it's an admirable attempt.

168
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,760
It is much too little, and it is much too late, because of their small scale, they should

169
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,400
have been testing this stuff maybe a year ago, but the ducks weren't in a row yet.

170
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:26,200
So we will get what we will get, and that'll be the LTS.

171
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,420
Well, this week KDE turned 21, if you can believe that.

172
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,640
It's been around for that long.

173
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,600
And looking back at the screenshots of the various versions of it, you can see it started

174
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,440
out looking very much like old-school Windows, and you can see the progression, and you can

175
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,260
see, I think the leap from 4.0 to 5.0 was really a big step.

176
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:53,480
And for me, pre-Plasma 5.0, it was not really relevant to me, whereas looking at some of

177
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,780
the early versions of that, and now it's maturing and we're getting towards this 5.12 LTS,

178
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,640
it's really come into its own, and I've stopped hating it, put it that way.

179
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,800
Yeah, October 14th, 1996, 21 years ago.

180
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:14,840
So now, if anyone ever asks you to define what does slow and steady pace mean, you can

181
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:21,880
say 21 years of slowly but steadily getting there.

They have self-paced, in-depth video courses on every Linux, Cloud, and DevOps topic.

190
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,080
They have hands-on, scenario-based labs that give you real experience on real servers.

191
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,600
You get to SSH in and use it like a real human being, and if you ever get stuck speaking

192
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,680
to humans, they got full-time instructors, actual humans, not bots, not chat bots, real

193
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,680
human instructors that are happy to advise and answer questions.

194
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,780
They have course schedulers if you're busy, they got certification training if that's

195
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,000
the route you're going, and they have a community stacked full of Jupiter Broadcasting members,

196
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,760
as well as study guides, lesson audio, and personal notebooks that you can download and

197
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,080
take with you offline, and iOS and Android apps.

198
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,960
Maybe you're commuting, you're on the go, you're sitting in the passenger seat, you're

199
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,440
on the bus, you're on the train, use one of their on-the-go apps, linuxacademy.com slash

203
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,600
One of the long-running problems on Linux has been updating firmware, and it's often

204
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,480
meant having to boot into a Windows partition or some sort of DOS environment.

205
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,920
But thanks to fwupd, I don't know how you pronounce it, firmware update basically, that

206
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,720
is getting a lot easier in Linux, and they have reached the milestone of a 1.0 release.

207
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,960
This is one of those projects that really makes Linux feel like a full-fledged desktop

208
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
citizen.

209
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,400
You open up your software update, and right in there at the top, there's a firmware update.

210
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,760
I remember when there was like a mistake or a vulnerability in the Intel microcode recently.

211
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,600
I think that's what it was.

212
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,040
There's so many zero days these days, but I remember I opened up software update on

213
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,360
my Dell XPS 13, and boom, there it was right there, months I think before Windows had even

214
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
had it.

215
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,320
Now fwupd supports 72 different kinds of hardware, so from low-level firmware in your laptop

216
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:43,560
to Logitech multi-receivers, and this is done through a combination of fwupd and the Linux

217
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,920
vendor firmware project, which is the interface that the companies work with to submit the

218
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,640
firmware and get it distributed.

219
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,540
Behind the scenes, it's all pretty easy stuff for them.

220
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,240
It's even using Microsoft cab files to distribute the stuff.

221
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,260
They're making it as easy as possible for these vendors, and huge portions of the project

222
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:08,400
have been contributed by Dell and other vendors, and version 1.0 represents a pretty big change.

223
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,800
There's an ABI breakage, they've removed a lot of cruft, and they've rebuilt a lot of

224
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:17,780
things, renamed things to the more appropriate naming scheme, all that kind of good stuff,

225
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,680
but they're going to maintain the 0.9 version for quite a while.

226
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,680
So if you're on current versions of Fedora, you're going to actually see Fedora ship 0.9

227
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,680
for a little while.

228
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,880
Well, that's still being maintained by the project, so there are going to be two versions

229
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,400
maintained by the project for a bit while they make this transition.

230
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Such a great project, Joe.

231
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,080
Yeah, and it's great to see that they are going to maintain 0.9 because rather than

232
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,160
just abandoning that and going on with the new and shiny, they realize that that is just

233
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,800
something that they have to do.

234
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,680
Yeah, they were able to do that without any user metrics, without doing deep data analysis

235
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,000
on their users' activities, unlike other companies.

236
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Other companies?

237
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Hmm, what, like OnePlus?

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,720
Yeah, yeah, it's not really a good, FWUpdate's not really a company, but you get my gist.

239
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,800
Yeah, so OnePlus have been collecting way more data than they should have been from

240
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:19,640
their users' phones, including IMEI numbers, MAC addresses, mobile network names, serial

241
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,640
numbers, and potentially even a bit more than that.

242
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:29,000
And okay, they were being sent back over HTTPS, which is kind of good because often these

243
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,080
things will just be plain text, which is never a good thing.

244
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:39,240
And you can opt out of it if you go into the settings, but on by default and some of the

245
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,840
stuff you can't opt out from, it's not a good look for OnePlus.

246
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,300
And it makes me feel very happy that the first thing I did when I bought my 3T was flash

247
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,580
lineage on it.

248
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,580
Good point.

249
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,680
This only affects the Oxygen OS that ships on these OnePlus devices.

250
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,860
So if you've wiped it, then you're already away from this.

251
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,560
But something that struck me about this entire situation is they said they're going to dial

252
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,320
it back a bit, but it sounds like they're just going to dial back some of the more identifiable

253
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,000
stuff and still collect a lot of metrics.

254
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,960
Some of this stuff I don't have an issue with.

255
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,620
When the phone reboots, when it updates, that makes sense to me.

256
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,960
How often you run an app, when you wake it up, when you check the time.

257
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,440
These types of metrics, I'm less and less comfortable with that.

258
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,280
And I would like companies to start rethinking data collection because OnePlus's defense

259
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,240
is we would never share this information.

260
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,680
We would never sell this information.

261
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,140
And my thinking is what happens if you get compromised?

262
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,020
What happens when you get bought?

263
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:41,440
What happens if in two years from now you come up with a new revenue idea and you create

264
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,340
a new partnership and all of a sudden they get access to this data?

265
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,240
That's what I think about.

266
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,380
And I want them to consider that.

267
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,960
And I guess maybe I'm asking too much.

268
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,200
But if you can't give me a satisfactory answer, then don't collect the data.

269
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,640
Just don't collect it.

270
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,600
Or have it be an option in the setup.

271
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,680
Do you want to help us out by giving us these metrics and let people tick the box or at

272
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,160
least untick it, maybe.

273
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,440
But don't have it on by default and then only when you get busted for doing it, tell people

274
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
how to turn it off.

275
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
Right.

276
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,160
And doesn't it sound like they are going to update a few interface things to make it easier

277
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,280
to opt out and they will stop collecting telephone numbers, MAC addresses, and Wi-Fi information

278
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,920
eventually, by the end of October, I think they said.

279
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,520
So that's some improvement, yeah?

280
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,120
Well for new phones that they sell, certainly.

281
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,960
And whether or not they'll do it for the old ones, let's hope so.

282
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,640
It just makes me think, as I said, I'm so glad that I didn't use OxygenOS.

283
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,680
Even though I hear it's a little bit faster than Lineage on the 3T, but just not interested

284
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,680
in it.

285
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,920
You know what we really need, Joe, is we need a phone that respects our privacy, a privacy

286
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,720
focused smartphone that can withstand the test of credibility by virtue of true community

287
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,680
ownership and audibility of the code.

288
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
We need a hero.

289
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,680
Yeah.

290
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,680
Well, let's talk about this for the first time ever.

291
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,360
And the Purism Librem 5, they've done such a good job of promoting this.

292
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,600
I cannot believe that anyone wouldn't know what it is, but I suppose we should explain

293
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,160
it a little bit.

294
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,880
So this is a crowdfunded five inch smartphone that is going to run proper GNU slash Linux.

295
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,520
It's going to have a CPU that is separate from the baseband so it can run totally free

296
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:31,160
software and you can completely turn off the radio for it, the mobile connection.

297
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,040
And it's going to be totally free software, at least in theory.

298
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:41,000
And so they did this campaign, which most people thought, huh, not a chance, $1.5 million.

299
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,640
They'll never get there.

300
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,080
But here we are and they've done it.

301
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,400
They've smashed through the $1.5 million.

302
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,960
This thing is happening.

303
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Yeah.

304
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,840
And it came sort of in a surprising way, a couple of huge contributions there at the

305
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,260
last moment.

306
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:04,400
And as we record this episode right now, they've not only gone over their milestone, like what

307
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,720
they wanted to achieve, but now they're going for stretch goals.

308
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:13,520
They've raised $1.7 million and they still have eight days left to go.

309
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,380
So that's 114.84% funded at this point.

310
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,040
But now the real hard part starts.

311
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:24,160
They've only got 1.7, they might get to 2 million.

312
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,040
That's not a lot of money to produce a smartphone from scratch, is it?

313
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,360
And the OS that goes on it and the applications that run on that OS.

314
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,160
See, this is really what I'm concerned about because it all seems like the hard part now.

315
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,840
It seems like building the hardware is the hard part.

316
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,320
It seems like creating an operating system that's actually usable on a touchscreen device

317
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,320
is the hard part.

318
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,200
Integrating matrix calling so that way it feels like a first class phone call and text

319
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,920
messaging experience feels like the hard part.

320
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:55,280
And then figuring out a way to manufacture enough of these devices and ship them to the

321
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,360
backers in a time that you have committed to, that seems like that could be maybe the

322
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,360
hard part.

323
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,880
Well, except that they have given themselves till 2019 to ship it.

324
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,280
So they have given themselves over a year, kind of two years really.

325
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,880
So I'm not necessarily worried about the timescale.

326
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,440
I'm more worried about whether that money is going to stretch far enough to do the R&D

327
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,760
as well as actually ship the product because it's going to cost them at least like $200

328
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,920
per phone to make it.

329
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,560
You would have thought maybe even more than that.

330
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,280
And then they've got to send it out.

331
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,120
That's like another $20 or whatever.

332
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,440
And so really the amount of money that they've got to spend on the R&D is minimal.

333
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,440
That's a pretty good point.

334
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,400
If you think about two years or so and building phones, especially your first batch is going

335
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:51,160
to be your most expensive run, yeah, that 1.5 million or so, I guess now it's actually

336
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,840
1.7 million, is not that much money.

337
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,240
Now in the meantime, they may have a growing success with their laptop business.

338
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,360
I just reviewed the Librem 15 in Linux Unplugged 218.

339
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,160
And after a couple of attempts, they've now I think got a very competitive laptop on their

340
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,440
hands on every sense of that word.

341
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,460
And if that business begins to pick up, that might generate some revenue and perhaps this

342
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,900
crowd funder ends up bridging the gap to get them between the two points.

343
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,460
And that's a risky game.

344
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,480
And I really hope they're successful because the success and excitement around this crowd

345
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,520
funder demonstrates there at least is some appetite for this product in the market.

346
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,280
Even if it's us geeks, there are geeks that have an appetite for this product.

347
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
Yeah.

348
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,600
And also you would have thought that this will have probably generated them loads of

349
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,740
free publicity for their laptops because people will have gone to them for the phone having

350
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,940
heard about it and then, oh, they do laptops too that are totally free software.

351
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,160
And so that side of the business might well be doing better as a result of it.

352
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:01,080
It's not something I'd really thought about, but perhaps that will subsidize the research

353
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,420
and development on the phone.

354
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,760
Another market trend that could be in purism's favor is more and more people are getting

355
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,760
interested in privacy respecting products.

356
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,160
And that's an area where they have some traction and seem to be getting more.

357
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:18,020
They recently made an announcement that they're signing up a deal with Monero, which is a

358
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,260
mobile payment system.

359
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,080
And when I say Monero, I think it's going to be a payment processor that supports Monero.

360
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,360
But the takeaway message here is no doubt that the Monero project is well known for

361
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,000
being the really truly private cryptocurrency.

362
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,720
It uses a different crypto algorithm than Bitcoin, and it is a truly decentralized privacy

363
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:44,040
first cryptocurrency that you could exchange with Bitcoin or cash or whatever if you wanted

364
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
to.

365
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:51,240
But it's a good middleman exchange cryptocurrency because it's truly private respecting by default.

366
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,720
Yeah, it doesn't log who you are and how much you spent in the blockchain, which is very

367
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,280
unusual and I think unique in terms of these cryptocurrencies.

368
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:07,860
So it is very much like cash, unlike Bitcoin where everything is totally traceable.

369
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,520
And if you spend enough time digging through the blockchain, you can work out more or less

370
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,160
who has sent what money to who, whereas with Monero, not so much.

371
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,080
So yeah, they seem to be making the right deals with the right people, don't they?

372
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,440
GNOME, KDE, Matrix, and now Monero.

373
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,640
And the Monero community is pretty excited about it.

374
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,760
I saw a lot of them looking at Purism laptops for the first time ever, thinking, well, now

375
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,680
I can buy a piece of hardware with my hard-earned crypto.

376
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,200
And the Monero is, if you were to peg it to the US dollar, it's somewhere around 100 US

377
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,200
greenbacks right now.

378
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Yeah, I looked earlier.

379
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
It was kind of 70-ish.

380
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Oh, really?

381
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Oh, maybe that was 70 pounds.

382
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
So yeah, about 100.

383
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
Oh, pounds.

384
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
Yeah.

385
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,640
Yeah, so it's in that scale.

386
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,840
And that's, of course, all these different cryptocurrencies.

387
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,720
You can buy other cryptocurrencies with each other.

388
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:05,400
And so people can buy Monero with Bitcoin and then use the Monero for the actual purchase,

389
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,860
which is probably a common use case.

390
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,800
And it's helping sort of seed the Monero community.

391
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,280
And now you have more products like these from Purism coming online.

392
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:21,080
And it is getting noticed by people that really follow this deep privacy stuff.

393
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,280
Now I guess we just sit back and see what happens with the Librem 5 and see how many

394
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,280
stretch goals they make.

395
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,040
Because they do have some stretch goals they're going for.

396
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:31,560
Yeah, but the first stretch goal starts at 4 million, which I think is a little bit ambitious.

397
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,040
So we're probably not going to actually see them.

398
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,380
I think it's probably going to get to about 2 million.

399
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,380
I hope you're right.

400
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,040
Because even 2 million would be a good chunk of change.

401
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
And the more, the merrier.

402
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,240
Because now that it's been funded, we're all in at this point.

403
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,400
We all want to see this happen.

404
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,120
And there's a lot of excitement around it.

405
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,300
And of course, there's one place you can go to find out when there is something new to

406
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,060
report about this project.
