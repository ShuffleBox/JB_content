00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:20,560
This is episode 20, recorded on September 24th, 2017.

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,560
I'm Joe.

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,560
And I'm Wes.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,560
Hello, Wes.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,760
Thank you for joining me this week.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,680
The boss is away, driving to New York.

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,680
He's almost there.

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,240
I saw his Rover log.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,520
Yeah, sounds like a great trip.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,440
I'm a little bit jealous, that's for sure.

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,440
Thank you for having me.

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,080
It looks like we have an excellent show today.

14
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,040
Yeah, well, let's get straight into it then.

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,140
So the Librem 5 is a device that we've been talking about on this show for two weeks already,

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,800
and now it's going to get a third outing.

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,400
And this time it's because the Gnome Foundation have officially partnered with Purism.

18
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,920
They've given it their official backing.

19
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,640
So I don't know whether to think that this is just good publicity or what, but either

20
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,800
way, it seems to have bumped up their crowdfunded total that little bit more.

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,520
Hey, that's definitely what counts in the end.

22
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,780
And from my perspective, I've definitely had a little bit of Purism skepticism in the past.

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,440
So having more of the technologies they rely on, having the sort of official endorsement,

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,380
that plus a lot of other changes that I've seen, some of the momentum they've been building

25
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,260
recently, and I think their improved transparency of late, all of those have kind of come together

26
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,080
and I'm feeling a lot better about them, you know, as a company and a project.

27
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
Yeah.

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,080
So the Gnome Foundation say they're committed to partnering with Purism to create Hackfest

29
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,840
tools, emulators, and build awareness that surround moving Gnome and GTK onto the Librem

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
5 phone.

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,860
A little bit nebulous, not any kind of concrete promises there, but it's still good that they've

32
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:49,540
got Gnome and KDE, and I spoke to Jonathan Riddle about it, and he said that it's almost

33
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,680
like the early noughties KDE Gnome wars all over again.

34
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,400
Hey, that's got to be good, you know, some competition.

35
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,000
Maybe they'll both be able to compete here, we'll end up with two awesome stacks on a

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,480
largely free phone.

37
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,800
Yeah, I'm just wondering which way they're going to go in the end.

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,880
That's actually if it meets its crowdfunding total, when it's still like a million dollars

39
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,040
away from that, so let's not forget that.

40
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,400
Ooh, yeah, that's a very good note.

41
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,720
Here's hoping, but that is a lofty goal.

42
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,080
Yeah, well, it's still a fair way off, and the trajectory looks good, but I don't want

43
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,640
to get too excited yet, and I just, I'm not willing to take the risk, so good luck to

44
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,320
him, and I keep saying that.

45
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,280
I hope it happens, and then maybe I can buy one afterwards.

46
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Amen.

47
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,520
So, speaking of phones, let's talk about Replicant.

48
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,080
So Replicant is the totally free software version of Android, and they've had another

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,640
release this week.

50
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
6.0.

51
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,920
Well, they did have a 6.0 out before, so this is just another 6.0 release that's got some

52
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,320
security fixes, but most importantly, some new devices, when I say new devices, they're

53
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:57,200
all pretty old devices, unfortunately, and that kind of reflects the situation that you

54
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,400
have with Android, that the newer devices are just basically impossible to run totally

55
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
free software on.

56
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,360
Yeah, it's a little disappointing when you read, I mean, I'm glad that this exists.

57
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,360
We sort of need that, right?

58
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,440
It helps the ecosystem, I think, at least in some ways, even if only in theory, but

59
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,160
reading through it, it's a little hard to get excited about when I don't have any of

60
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
those devices.

61
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:22,120
I'm not about to go get one, so I just, I'm not going to play with Replicant anytime soon,

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
unfortunately.

63
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,960
Yeah, the device that seems most attractive to me is the Galaxy S3, because that is still

64
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,520
a reasonably good phone.

65
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,200
Yeah, and especially if you're running some open-source software, you're not loading the

66
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,040
latest giant proprietary app, you could still get some real use out of it.

67
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Yeah, so even with lineage and no Google apps, you could still get pretty decent performance

68
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
out of that phone, I think.

69
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,400
Oh, that's a great point.

70
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,920
With just F-Droid, so this is, basically, that on steroids, if you want free software,

71
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,880
they do their very best to make all the drivers free.

72
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,000
So yeah, I thought it was worth giving them a shout out anyway, it would be great to see

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,800
more development and more money go into this, because there's just so little free software

74
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,720
when it comes to phones, we've just accepted that you're going to have all these blobs

75
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,960
going on, even if you're running lineage, like I am, there's still going to be a load

76
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,080
of proprietary software blobs running in the background.

77
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,080
You just can't escape it.

78
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,140
So yeah, it's nice to see a little bit more momentum here.

79
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,840
Good luck to Replicant.

80
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:25,440
And yet more mobile news, UbiPorts have released OTA2, and there's more devices there as well.

81
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,800
So UbiPorts is, well, they're still calling it Ubuntu Touch, it's a bit confusing, they

82
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,160
don't seem to have their branding quite sorted out yet, because as we know, Shuttleworth

83
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,980
pulled the plug on Convergence and Ubuntu Touch and Unity 8 and all that kind of stuff.

84
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:45,960
But the mobile stuff was forked, well, I suppose just carried on really by the UbiPorts team.

85
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,720
Yeah, in the grand tradition of open source.

86
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
Yeah.

87
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,720
And I was a bit skeptical that they would have enough resources to do it.

88
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,000
But here we are, they've released two proper releases now.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,840
And this one is pretty solid, I tried it out today on a Nexus 5, which is one of the officially

90
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,400
supported devices.

91
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,840
And it works quite well.

92
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,080
I mean, it's basically Ubuntu Touch, it's a little bit more polished than it was when

93
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,800
Ubuntu and well, Canonical killed it.

94
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,040
But it's still not ready for mainstream use.

95
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,760
But that's the thing that my whole attitude to it changed.

96
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:24,200
I don't know if that was the same for you, when it stopped being this consumer product

97
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,760
and started to be just a community project again, suddenly, my expectations for it were

98
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
kind of lowered.

99
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,560
And I just accepted that, hey, it's a good project.

100
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,560
It's got potential.

101
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,560
Right.

102
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,840
And it has the potential where it needs to be to be successful kind of changes, right?

103
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,040
Like, if it supports some phones, if people can get some use out of it, that's totally

104
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,400
successful in the open source world, not as a like mainstream consumer product, though.

105
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,960
So I think you're right, mine has to and I've tried it on a Nexus 5.

106
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,440
Unfortunately, my Nexus 5 is really on its last leg.

107
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:01,320
So I'm in another situation here where I don't have a phone that I can run this on today.

108
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,560
But I would love to see it.

109
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,800
I've enjoyed using Ubuntu Touch in the past.

110
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,900
And certainly, I might not use it on my main mobile device.

111
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,800
But for projects, for embedded devices, anything that I maybe have an old tablet laying around,

112
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,240
I would love that to be able to run Ubuntu Touch.

113
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
Yeah.

114
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,040
And so they say with this release, we're officially supporting the Nexus 4 and Nexus 7 2013 Wi-Fi

115
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,000
version.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,040
And users of this device will find that they can install Ubuntu Touch 15.04 using the UbiPorts

117
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,560
installer, which I tried the app image of today.

118
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,040
And that worked absolutely brilliantly.

119
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Oh, great.

120
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,120
So yeah, I recommend that.

121
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,680
They've got an AXE and a DMG if you're on a evil proprietary operating system.

122
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,880
And they've got a dev as well.

123
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,680
So there's plenty of ways to install it.

124
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,880
And it just makes it so much easier than messing around with the command line.

125
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,360
It's just you run this nice, simple GUI, and it gets it sorted out.

126
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,920
No fastboot, no ADB, just boom, done.

127
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,680
Yeah, well, all that stuff's embedded in that, I assume, because it needs to be.

128
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,720
Right, it has to be.

129
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,560
And that's one of those little things adds a lot of polish and makes it seem like a successful

130
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,120
project with momentum.

131
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,120
And hey, maybe you could even get your only a little technical friend to play with it.

132
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Yeah.

133
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,040
And I was actually speaking to Marius Gripsgard, I think it is, in the Late Night Linux Telegram

134
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,920
channel yesterday about this.

135
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:26,240
And he basically admitted, if that's the word, that he is testing a 16.04 version with Halliam

136
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,600
on a OnePlus 3.

137
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Wow.

138
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,840
So that is coming.

139
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,400
It's not anywhere near official at this point.

140
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,160
It's very much internally developed and tested.

141
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,560
But this latest release isn't based on Halliam, which, is it Halliam?

142
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,920
I never know how to say that one.

143
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
I don't know either.

144
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:52,880
Yeah, which is a project that's kind of bringing together a lot of the Linux based mobile OSs.

145
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,880
So that's still in the future.

146
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,440
But it's on the horizon, which is good to see.

147
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,360
Yes, I would love 16.04 on my phone.

148
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Oh, man.

149
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,440
Yeah, it would be good.

150
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,120
It's kind of strange that it's all based on 15.04, which is...

151
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,460
Right, that's a weird base.

152
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,000
It's not a standard LTS or anything like that.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,840
Yeah, yeah, strange.

154
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
Not supported anymore.

155
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,920
And just, you know, it must be a bit of a hack.

156
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,680
So there we go.

157
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,620
All right, well, let's move on and talk about PipeWire.

158
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:26,760
So PipeWire is the latest creation from one of the co-creators of Gstreamer called VimTamans

159
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,760
or WimTamans.

160
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,640
I've butchered that, sorry.

161
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,600
And it is basically the pulse audio for video.

162
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,920
Is that fair to say?

163
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,320
You know, it's something like that.

164
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,540
What I found really interesting was it's not only going to be for video.

165
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:43,220
This first release is for video, but there's plans to include audio as well.

166
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,800
So it's pulse audio plus video.

167
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,480
Yeah, which kind of makes sense, doesn't it?

168
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,060
Because one of the major multimedia issues that you have with Linux is syncing of audio

169
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,440
and video together.

170
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,220
Yes, definitely.

171
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,580
And I think that speaks well of the development here, too.

172
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,420
It seems like they understand, you know, they're not just trying to develop the tool that scratches

173
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,420
their itch.

174
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,540
They look holistically at the problem space and they want to build, you know, the next

175
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,460
foundation of audio visual tools on Linux.

176
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,060
And that's definitely something we need, especially if we want more developers to be able to target

177
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,060
the platform.

178
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:24,460
Yeah, but the thing is that this is not just for audio visual stuff like video editing

179
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,600
and streaming and OBS stuff like JB does all the time.

180
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,620
It's also got wider implications, hasn't it, for remote desktops and stuff.

181
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,620
Yes, definitely.

182
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,900
It sounds like they've done some great work trying to put in some, you know, put in some

183
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,060
new shims, some build some foundations for the Wayland era that we are fast approaching

184
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,140
so that we have remote desktop capabilities, screenshot capabilities, but in a, you know,

185
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,920
at a foundational level that doesn't have to be hack implemented in each window manager.

186
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,740
The fact is we are moving to Wayland.

187
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,300
There are no two ways about it.

188
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,680
It's happening.

189
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,580
And you can't expect to have things that are based on working with X that are going to

190
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,660
work long term.

191
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,180
So we need to rethink stuff.

192
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,860
Now is the time as we're moving to Wayland to do this, I think.

193
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,260
And calling it pulse audio, I don't know.

194
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:17,980
People have had a lot of bad experiences because that was introduced too early into Fedora.

195
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,620
And this is going to be in the next version of Fedora.

196
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,340
So the question is, is it going to be ready?

197
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,540
Is it going to be another pulse audio gate, as it were?

198
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,220
Here's hoping that it's going to be more ready than Pulse was.

199
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,220
Yeah.

200
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,500
I think it seems like people have learned a little bit from that mistake and are trying

201
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
to avoid it.

202
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,980
This first release looks like it just has video and audio will be added later partially

203
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,780
because they are worried about that problem.

204
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:48,620
But it does, you know, we had Wim on Linux Unplugged 2.15.

205
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,540
Based on that, I had a lot of trust for the development models that they're doing, that

206
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:58,180
they really know the problem space well and that they're not trying to just rush in and

207
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,460
be the next big hyped thing in the Linux platform.

208
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,540
Yeah, do check out Linux Unplugged episode 2.15 and you can hear more from Wes.

209
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,540
Exactly.

210
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:10,900
And it looks like, you know, if you're an Arch user, or PipeWire has already packaged

211
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:17,740
an Arch and a few other distributions, so you might be able to just try it at home yourself.

212
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
DigitalOcean.com.

213
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,940
Sign up with the promo code, here's the thing, to get $10 credit.

214
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,300
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

215
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,700
easy way to spin up a cloud server.

216
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,620
And you can do so in 55 seconds, and with prices starting at only $5 per month, that

217
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,540
means you can get two months free if you use the promo code, here's the thing.

218
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,840
They've got data centers all over the world and they've got a great simple interface for

219
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,940
dealing with your droplets, as they call them, and they've got a great API as well if you

220
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,940
want to script it.

221
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,540
Loads of the JB infrastructure runs on DigitalOcean, and I've been using it for years personally.

222
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,460
And now, as well as block storage, you can also use object storage with DigitalOcean

223
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,420
with their new product, Spaces.

224
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,240
From just $5 a month with very reasonable rates on storage and transfer, you can scale

225
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,940
the storage that your project needs as desired.

226
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,140
And best of all, you get two months free trial with that as well.

227
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,740
So whether you want just a small next cloud server or a hugely powerful Linux rig out

228
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,780
in the cloud, go to DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code, here's the thing, and get

229
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,820
$10 in credit to get you started.

230
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,880
Well Joe, I know how much you love proprietary software running on your machine outside of

231
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,300
your control.

232
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,980
We've got some new developments over on the EFF's website.

233
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:40,140
They've got a new open letter about the recent W3C decisions around encrypted media extensions.

234
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,900
And for people who might not know, could you explain encrypted media extensions?

235
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:51,580
Well, to massively oversimplify it, it's a standard in HTML which allows encrypted media,

236
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,580
as it would suggest.

237
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,100
DRM is what we're talking about here.

238
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:59,180
So the likes of Netflix can stream stuff to you without you being able to dump it and

239
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,180
save it.

240
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,580
And this was proposed a few years ago to be added to the W3C standards.

241
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,380
And to say there was a bit of a controversy here is a bit of an understatement.

242
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,940
There's been an argument going on for years.

243
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,780
And this week it was officially voted into the standards.

244
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,900
Now at some point there was a suggestion of compromise whereby it would be brought in,

245
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:31,980
but security researchers could still hack on it and try and find vulnerabilities and

246
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:38,140
responsibly disclose them, but that was shot down and is not happening now.

247
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:47,700
So there was a vote of 108 in favor and 57 against with quite a lot of people abstaining.

248
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,980
And the thing is that the W3C is supposed to be about consensus.

249
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,500
And that is not exactly a consensus, is it?

250
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,180
That's democracy, but it's not a consensus.

251
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,180
Decidedly not a consensus.

252
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,020
And especially when we have, you know, this will have far-ranging implications and this

253
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,820
is about the only real kind of somewhat governance we have for the Wild West of the World Wide

254
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,820
Web.

255
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,940
Yeah.

256
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:19,020
And so the EFF, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, were members of the W3C for quite some time,

257
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,300
but that's it.

258
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:27,820
Cory Doctorow has said, we're leaving, I'm resigning, and you can just get on with it,

259
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,780
which is really sad because the EFF are a really important organization.

260
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:38,900
And for them to basically be forced into leaving over this is not good.

261
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:44,060
I wonder if they had to, I suppose they kind of did, but I think that maybe there was a

262
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:51,220
way to work through this and vocally, very publicly voice their concerns about it and

263
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,420
their distaste about it, but still be within the organization because we need that voice

264
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,860
of reason.

265
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,780
So it's a real disappointment here.

266
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,400
Yeah, it's like at one hand it makes a big fuss.

267
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,780
We're obviously talking about it here because of that, but what do we lose in the future

268
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,980
by their voice not being on the council?

269
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,980
Yeah.

270
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:15,780
So where do you stand on encrypted media extensions anyway, and DRM as an HTML standard?

271
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:20,540
The idea is that we get away from these plugins and Flash and Silverlight and everything.

272
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:25,560
And do you accept, are you pragmatic enough to realize that you're going to have DRM one

273
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,820
way or another?

274
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,940
I think at the end of the day I am, and I do want to be able to watch Netflix or other

275
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,140
services or still be able to pitch Linux and open source operating systems to friends and

276
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,700
family and they're going to want to do those things, even if I might not want to.

277
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:45,460
I thought that the compromise that was ultimately rejected was fairly reasonable because we

278
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:51,540
are going to have to interact with these proprietary blobs that are running, managing the DRM.

279
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:55,580
The least thing that we can be allowed to do is still introspect, still poke at our

280
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,140
system, still have the ownership and control.

281
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:02,900
Otherwise, what was ultimately accepted here, it really does start to take away from this

282
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,660
open web feeling and, yeah, sure, I downloaded Chrome, I'm running it on my laptop.

283
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,660
It's different now.

284
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:16,080
It's going to be farther away from Chromium and I feel less free to use and it's either

285
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,060
my control or their control.

286
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,460
I don't feel as in control.

287
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,740
You're starting to sound like Stallman there.

288
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
I know.

289
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,820
And so that's, I definitely have those feelings at the end of the day, this is going to happen

290
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,660
and I'm certainly going to use it.

291
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,820
It's definitely sad though.

292
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:38,020
Yeah, it's not ideal, but I think it was inevitable and we just have to deal with it, unfortunately.

293
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,160
Find other ways that we can continue to be free on the web.

294
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Yeah.

295
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,700
So let's talk about Facebook.

296
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,700
What?

297
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,540
Why are we talking about Facebook?

298
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,900
Well, we're talking about ReactJS.

299
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:54,260
So this is another controversy that has been brewing for a while.

300
00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:04,600
So React and Jest and Flow and Immutable, loads of the modern web developer type frameworks

301
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:13,340
were licensed by Facebook as the BSD plus patents license, which basically meant that

302
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:19,820
if you use the software, you can't sue Facebook even if they infringe on your patents, which

303
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:24,200
is questionable at best.

304
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:30,700
And so Apache a few weeks ago, the Apache Foundation, actually back in July, it feels

305
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,860
like a few weeks ago.

306
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,860
It sure does.

307
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,860
Where did some go?

308
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:41,060
But anyway, they said that no new projects can use it, any software that has this license.

309
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,540
And then more recently, Automatic, who are the developers of WordPress, announced that

310
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:51,660
they are not going to use React in their next major update, which is called Gutenberg.

311
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,220
And also, they were going to rewrite the last one called Calypso to not include it.

312
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:03,080
And shortly after that announcement, here we are, Facebook have caved in and they have

313
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,940
relicensed it as just plain old MIT.

314
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,940
It's big news.

315
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,620
But I think on one hand, it's kind of also not big news.

316
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,020
The real takeaway I saw from a lot of this discussion is just software patents are a

317
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:21,420
huge existential crisis that the software world is not really dealing with.

318
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,780
And what Facebook did with this kind of nonstandard license is make everyone have to start thinking

319
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,780
about patents.

320
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,700
Because right now, now we're in a situation where under MIT, there's some legal opinions

321
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,800
that MIT includes an implicit patent grant, but it doesn't specify that.

322
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,260
So before you had an actual grant of the patents.

323
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,100
With MIT, it's somewhat less clear.

324
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,220
While you don't have this other clause that takes away some of your rights, you're not

325
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,540
sure about the actual patents.

326
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,820
The other part that just shows how messed up this whole situation is, is in all the

327
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,460
discussions no one's even sure if there were like patents on some of these things.

328
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,780
Do they have patents on what the technology underneath React?

329
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,780
Nobody knows.

330
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,780
It's too hard to tell.

331
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,300
There's too many bad patents that exist.

332
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,540
I can also somewhat understand Facebook's motivations originally because they put out

333
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,340
a lot of open source software.

334
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,820
And because of the patent situation, I'm sure they must get all kinds of frivolous lawsuits.

335
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,020
And so this was their somewhat heavy handed attempt to try to put a stop to that.

336
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,260
And while that's not ideal, I do value the amount of open source work that they do.

337
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,220
They have a large number of developers, and they've given the world a lot of really good

338
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,220
software.

339
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,900
That's a very pragmatic view.

340
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,100
And I haven't really heard that.

341
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,100
All I've heard is, for the last few months, just ragging on Facebook saying that they're

342
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,860
a terrible company and why they're taking advantage of people like this.

343
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,380
So it's interesting to hear the other side of it and a more reasonable approach.

344
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:45,020
Yeah, I'm hopeful that after this change, even if it's not really changed, it doesn't

345
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,920
solve a giant problem.

346
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,620
Even for WordPress, it sounds like WordPress's decision wasn't even that they were that concerned

347
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,700
about the patent part, but that switching to the nonstandard license was causing other

348
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,300
people to have concerns and they were worried that that would hurt WordPress adoption.

349
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,460
So if we can just get back to a, you know, all right, well, no one's thinking about patents

350
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:05,340
anymore and people can continue to use React, which I personally, that's my framework of

351
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,340
choice for UI work.

352
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,220
I think it's a great technology.

353
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,940
I'd like to see it continue to succeed.

354
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:16,420
Yeah, and Matt Mullenweg, I think that's how you say it, who is the founder of WordPress,

355
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:21,300
has written a blog post a few hours ago that hasn't quite cleared up whether or not they

356
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,780
are going to go with it, you know, to change their mind basically back to going with it.

357
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:29,760
But they've certainly left the door open with his blog post there.

358
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,580
So we'll have to see because my understanding is it is a very popular framework.

359
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,220
Yes, very much so.

360
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,940
It sort of changed the way people looked at frameworks because it operates on this diffing

361
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,940
mechanism.

362
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,060
So instead of having to, you know, manually update various things, add a new div or something,

363
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,020
you just describe what you want it to look like.

364
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,620
React handles all the automatic diffing and figures that out for you.

365
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,860
So it makes it really simple to work with, very clean UI architectures that you can build.

366
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,900
There are some like drop-in compatible, Preact is one, basically API compatible with React,

367
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,780
but by going there, you lose out.

368
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:06,540
Like Facebook just has such, not only dominance, but just they have such infrastructure and,

369
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,980
you know, just sheer number of developer hours, plus with the React ecosystem, you get things

370
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,300
like React Native.

371
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,340
So if you already have, you know, you're a web developer, maybe you don't know how to

372
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,420
write Objective-C, but with React Native, maybe you don't have to.

373
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,100
That seems like it'd be really lucrative, especially if you work on a small startup

374
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,100
or a small team.

375
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,140
Well, hopefully people will be less reluctant to use it now.

376
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,740
I know people were worried about it and hopefully this has put that fire out.

377
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,740
Exactly.

378
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:37,900
So speaking of patents, then Red Hat have announced a broad expansion to their open

379
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,300
patents promise.

380
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:46,940
And that promise is to not sue you for using any of their patents as long as the software

381
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,300
is open source.

382
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,860
Now what has been expanded here is that it's now going to cover permissive licenses.

383
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,320
So pretty much anything that is OSI or FSF approved is covered.

384
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,320
So the Open Source Initiative and the Free Software Foundation have got these lists of

385
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:12,620
approved licenses and it pretty much means any open source license is covered.

386
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:18,540
And they have got over 2,000 software patents, it seems, Red Hat.

387
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,960
So it's good to see them extend this promise and people can sleep that little bit easier

388
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,300
at night now, hopefully.

389
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:28,300
Yeah, and it's, you know, it's one of those interesting, we live in such a business dominated

390
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,300
world.

391
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,300
It's kind of nice we have good actors like Red Hat here who really, I mean, obviously

392
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,580
they make their money, it's good for their business model to support open source.

393
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,180
But you know, when you're a small open source developer, maybe you want to launch your new

394
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,820
product or you're just trying to, you know, help and support people in the United States.

395
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,780
Trying to interact with the patent system, trying to understand that, trying to even

396
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,920
just begin, that's a nightmare.

397
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,320
You don't have a budget for a lawyer.

398
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
Red Hat certainly does.

399
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,940
So if they can be this bridge between the open source community and the legal community

400
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,460
and just make sure that, yes, we are not going to do this, we're setting the standard that

401
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,880
if you're doing open source software, we realize you're not like a, you're not a business competitor,

402
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,300
you're not trying to take advantage of our patents.

403
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:11,100
I imagine there's a lot of people at Red Hat who don't even like all these software patents,

404
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,340
but to be defensive in the industry, they have to have them.

405
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,820
Here they're just on the open source side, which is great.

406
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,880
So how much of this is actually going to be a practical benefit to people and how much

407
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,800
is it just a publicity grab by them, you know, trying to improve their image that little

408
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,920
bit further?

409
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,920
That is a good question.

410
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,740
You definitely want to be seen as this open source friendly company.

411
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,320
There is a lot of details here reading through their actual patent promise, you know, covered

412
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,080
free and open source software.

413
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:42,640
So it seems a lot more clear now whether or not projects are actually even considering

414
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,640
this.

415
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,520
I think there is kind of a put your head in the sand approach to patents a lot of the

416
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,760
time where we're just not going to look, we're not going to investigate, just do it.

417
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,240
If someone sees us down the road, then I guess we deal with it then.

418
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,600
I don't know how practical this is, but if you happen to be using some Red Hat technology,

419
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,720
I guess you're in the clear.
