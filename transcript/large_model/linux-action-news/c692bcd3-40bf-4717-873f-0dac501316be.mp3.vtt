00:00.000 --> 00:08.920
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 154, recorded on September 13th, 2020.

00:08.920 --> 00:09.920
I'm Chris.

00:09.920 --> 00:10.920
And I'm Joe.

00:10.920 --> 00:11.920
Hello, Joe.

00:11.920 --> 00:12.920
Good to be connected with you.

00:12.920 --> 00:17.640
And I'm standing here holding my Pixel 3 running Android 11, so I think that's where we start

00:17.640 --> 00:18.640
this week.

00:18.640 --> 00:23.360
Yeah, after four developer previews and three betas, we've got the final release of Android

00:23.360 --> 00:24.360
11.

00:24.360 --> 00:28.880
And it's mostly on the Pixels to start with, with some betas for some OnePlus and Xiaomi

00:28.880 --> 00:33.360
phones, but I'm dying to know, is it any different from 10?

00:33.360 --> 00:35.360
It's pretty low key.

00:35.360 --> 00:38.640
I think the most improvements can be seen in the notifications.

00:38.640 --> 00:43.120
But even there, like with the new bubbles and notification stacks, I don't really use

00:43.120 --> 00:47.120
notifications much on my chat apps, so I don't really take advantage of that.

00:47.120 --> 00:50.720
And I don't know if Telegram is specifically taking advantage of it yet.

00:50.720 --> 00:53.740
It's probably the most low key update I've ever gotten.

00:53.740 --> 00:58.120
At the same time, nothing's really jumped out at me like I haven't had horrible battery

00:58.120 --> 00:59.120
life.

00:59.120 --> 01:03.720
In fact, if anything, within the last couple of updates, the standby time on my Pixel 3

01:03.720 --> 01:10.160
has gotten outrageous, like four days maybe, just if I don't use it, because I have two

01:10.160 --> 01:11.160
phones, right?

01:11.160 --> 01:12.160
Because I'm that guy.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.440
If I don't use it for like four days, it's still on.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.080
It's low, but it's still going.

01:16.080 --> 01:21.320
Runtime, actual use in runtime, I think that's not doing so good, but the Pixel 3 is getting

01:21.320 --> 01:22.320
old.

01:22.320 --> 01:25.920
As far as like under the hood stuff in Android 11 that's got my attention, Google introduced

01:25.920 --> 01:29.200
a new out of memory adjuster design.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.160
That's something that goes in there and helps clean up things when the system starts to

01:32.160 --> 01:34.040
run low on RAM.

01:34.040 --> 01:38.480
But one of the things they did in the new release is they adjusted it to avoid killing

01:38.480 --> 01:43.280
a process if it would quote, result in a user perceptible interruption of service.

01:43.280 --> 01:47.760
So that seems like they've made accommodations for low memory situations without theoretically

01:47.760 --> 01:49.440
directly impacting the user.

01:49.440 --> 01:53.200
I haven't hit those conditions yet, but I have in the past.

01:53.200 --> 01:56.480
And when that happens, I'm hoping for a better experience now.

01:56.480 --> 02:00.320
So did you update your Pixel 3 or did you go for a fresh installation?

02:00.320 --> 02:03.440
Because you said last week that it was running pretty slow at the moment.

02:03.440 --> 02:09.160
I did do an update and I'd say it's still running about the same.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.440
Once it gets up and going, it's not that bad.

02:11.440 --> 02:14.960
It's the having to get up and go that takes quite a while.

02:14.960 --> 02:19.840
I have spent a little time trimming back some of my applications and I did some updates.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.680
These new updates that are trickling in like often happens after a new Android release

02:23.680 --> 02:26.200
and not everybody's on the same schedule.

02:26.200 --> 02:31.640
As I go through some of that, it has gotten better, but no real difference overall.

02:31.640 --> 02:35.400
Like ultimately it's still turn it on, set it down.

02:35.400 --> 02:39.280
Also if I had it off for some reason, maybe to save like ultimately sometimes just to

02:39.280 --> 02:44.040
save data or to make sure my two different phones aren't competing for location information

02:44.040 --> 02:46.580
on some services, I just turn the phone off.

02:46.580 --> 02:51.360
But if I do that, I have to try to plug it in when I first turn it on because that good

02:51.360 --> 02:55.560
boot up process where all that stuff loads just drains the battery.

02:55.560 --> 02:59.440
I think that's the case with any Android device, especially if you get a bunch of notifications

02:59.440 --> 03:00.440
all the time.

03:00.440 --> 03:05.320
They kind of stack up and it doesn't really know that you've already read those telegram

03:05.320 --> 03:09.320
messages or emails or whatever on a different device and you just get bombarded.

03:09.320 --> 03:12.160
I hear that's better on the iPhone side of things.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.160
Yes.

03:13.160 --> 03:17.400
I must synchronize what messages have been read because I never get old notifications

03:17.400 --> 03:18.920
about old chats.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.760
That just doesn't happen on the iOS side.

03:20.760 --> 03:25.080
I'm not quite sure why that is, but I prefer that by quite a bit.

03:25.080 --> 03:30.280
That being said, Android 11 has kind of taken some of the nicer things about the iPhone

03:30.280 --> 03:34.240
10 generation gestures and incorporated them into 11.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.620
Now that they've had some extra time to bake, I think they're in a pretty good place.

03:37.620 --> 03:41.320
I think I might prefer the way it works on Android where I swipe up from the bottom and

03:41.320 --> 03:44.280
I get my recent app tray and then I swipe more and there's all the apps.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.160
I think I'm liking this.

03:46.160 --> 03:49.880
They really got there in 10, but in 11 it just feels even more refined.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.080
What about the new power menu stuff?

03:52.080 --> 03:56.480
The fact that you can control smart home devices and stuff from that, that seems a weird place

03:56.480 --> 03:57.480
to put it.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.480
I like that it's a physical button though.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.440
That is nice.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.960
And now the button's starting to do a lot of things.

04:02.960 --> 04:06.640
You double press the button on the Pixel device and it launches the camera.

04:06.640 --> 04:12.040
You hold it and what you get now is a UI that looks very much like the HomeKit UI, if you're

04:12.040 --> 04:16.360
familiar with that on iOS, or the Control Center pull down, where I've got power off

04:16.360 --> 04:17.360
and restart.

04:17.360 --> 04:22.200
I've got my Google Pay cards right here in the middle and then my top devices.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.820
And it seems to, I'm not sure how it sorts them.

04:24.820 --> 04:26.400
It's not alphabetical.

04:26.400 --> 04:30.120
It seems to be like which ones are actually active and it puts the active devices at the

04:30.120 --> 04:31.760
top of the list.

04:31.760 --> 04:36.620
What's pretty neat about that is just with one press of the button, I can now turn off

04:36.620 --> 04:38.280
all of the lights in the studio.

04:38.280 --> 04:39.280
I like that.

04:39.280 --> 04:40.280
All right.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.440
And what about the Android Auto stuff?

04:42.440 --> 04:43.440
That apparently has been improved.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.720
Yeah, although I think the major improvement there, I had already been rocking because

04:46.720 --> 04:52.880
I had a beta of Android Auto and my car doesn't support the wireless aspect, which is sort

04:52.880 --> 04:58.160
of the nice thing to have at Android Auto in 11 is the wireless stuff and mine's wired.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.160
Okay.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.720
I think it's a worthwhile upgrade overall because there was really no negatives that

05:01.720 --> 05:04.040
I could see and you get some new stuff.

05:04.040 --> 05:08.360
But if you're wondering when to land on your device, dear listener, we do have a link to

05:08.360 --> 05:14.120
XDAdevelopers.com, which has the Android 11 update tracker, it has the various manufacturers

05:14.120 --> 05:18.460
and the either estimated date of arrival or the status at least.

05:18.460 --> 05:23.620
And of course the Android open source project has now got the source code for Android 11.

05:23.620 --> 05:28.040
So we're starting to see the very first custom ROMs become available.

05:28.040 --> 05:33.280
So hopefully it won't be too long before we've got some stable alternatives that are based

05:33.280 --> 05:35.000
on AOSP.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.800
Also on the Android Go side of things, it's interesting to see some of the higher end

05:38.800 --> 05:43.080
features coming to the Android Go edition phones, which you'll recall are the lower

05:43.080 --> 05:47.980
tier Android devices with generally small amounts of RAM.

05:47.980 --> 05:51.120
They're kind of seeing some nice quality of life improvements, including some of those

05:51.120 --> 05:56.140
touch gestures I just mentioned, but also they seem to be preparing for more RAM in

05:56.140 --> 05:57.760
these Go devices.

05:57.760 --> 06:03.300
And you might wonder, in recent smartphone times, how common are low memory devices,

06:03.300 --> 06:04.820
even the cheap ones?

06:04.820 --> 06:09.880
Well XDA developers did a little digging and they say since September 3rd, 2019, the day

06:09.880 --> 06:15.840
when Google released Android 10, there have been 367 new devices added to the Google Play

06:15.840 --> 06:21.800
console device catalog that have at most, at most two gigs of RAM and either launched

06:21.800 --> 06:26.080
with Android 10 or upgraded to it in the life cycle that was captured.

06:26.080 --> 06:30.700
And if you include devices to the catalog after September 3rd, 2019, that either launched

06:30.700 --> 06:34.760
with Android 9 Pie or haven't yet received an update to Android 10 because it's still

06:34.760 --> 06:43.240
in the works, then that number jumps to almost 1500 that have launched since September 3rd,

06:43.240 --> 06:44.240
2019.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.600
So there's still a lot of devices being launched.

06:45.600 --> 06:50.780
It's not insane numbers, but you're seeing devices come on, be registered and be completely

06:50.780 --> 06:53.760
connected to the Google ecosystem still that have less than two gigs of RAM.

06:53.760 --> 06:57.560
Well, there's a big market out there that isn't necessarily Europe or North America.

06:57.560 --> 06:59.200
You know, it's a big world.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.200
Right.

07:00.200 --> 07:04.320
And Android Go edition is targeted right at that big world.

07:04.320 --> 07:09.820
And it seems like it's not that big of a compromise anymore to have a Go edition phone, faster

07:09.820 --> 07:15.320
launching times, better encryption support and different types of touch gesture support

07:15.320 --> 07:16.320
now.

07:16.320 --> 07:18.840
I mean, it's getting pretty equivalent to standard Android.

07:18.840 --> 07:19.840
Yeah.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.520
It makes me feel like I want Android Go on a more powerful phone.

07:22.520 --> 07:26.880
They're not going to allow that by default, but it sounds like a pretty appealing prospect

07:26.880 --> 07:27.880
to me.

07:27.880 --> 07:31.800
Well, regardless if it's an Android Go device or a pixel running Android 11, they're all

07:31.800 --> 07:34.520
powered by ARM chips.

07:34.520 --> 07:39.220
And as we're recording this, it looks very likely that it will be announced soon that

07:39.220 --> 07:46.840
SoftBank is set to sell their ARM holdings to Nvidia for around $40 billion and potentially

07:46.840 --> 07:50.260
because the story is rapidly developing, it could happen the day you're listening to this

07:50.260 --> 07:51.260
or shortly after.

07:51.260 --> 07:56.240
Yeah, this has been rumored for what feels like months now, various people were going

07:56.240 --> 08:01.400
to buy ARM, but then it seemed to trickle down to just Nvidia.

08:01.400 --> 08:05.540
And now it seems like those details have been worked out.

08:05.540 --> 08:09.400
And we're getting reports that have pretty firm now.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.480
So I suppose we have to treat it as though it is happening.

08:12.480 --> 08:13.480
It seems so.

08:13.480 --> 08:20.220
The thing that has shifted over the last couple of months is they were sorting out this other

08:20.220 --> 08:23.240
issue that was involved with some of the IP licensing.

08:23.240 --> 08:28.200
It hinged on SoftBank ending a messy dispute between ARM and the leads of its China joint

08:28.200 --> 08:30.120
venture.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.320
And there was problems there.

08:31.320 --> 08:34.020
In fact, there's still interesting rumors developing there.

08:34.020 --> 08:39.480
But several people close to the SoftBank deal said that the matter was now, quote, resolved.

08:39.480 --> 08:42.760
Although it's not quite clear what's happening with that China ARM and if it's continuing

08:42.760 --> 08:45.000
on its own, that's some of the rumors right now.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.740
But it seems that that messy dispute, as the Financial Times article puts it, is what was

08:49.740 --> 08:50.740
holding it up.

08:50.740 --> 08:51.740
And now that's resolved.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.320
So they're going to proceed really early this week.

08:54.320 --> 09:00.080
This comes at a pretty interesting time, given how Intel is struggling with their 7 nanometer.

09:00.080 --> 09:04.720
That was after it took them years to sort out the 10 nanometer development process.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.360
And we're still waiting for a complete shift to even 10 nanometer.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.840
They're still selling some CPUs that are 14 nanometer.

09:10.840 --> 09:17.000
And the reason why this matters, these nanometers, is because it's an indicator of Intel's manufacturing

09:17.000 --> 09:18.240
capability and capacity.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.700
They used to be the king.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.840
They were the ones that constantly were breaking Moore's Law.

09:23.840 --> 09:26.240
And now they can't get their process down.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.560
They can't get the results that they need.

09:28.560 --> 09:29.620
So yeah, I think it is interesting.

09:29.620 --> 09:33.840
Not only that timing, while Intel's on the ropes, and has been for a while now, for years

09:33.840 --> 09:35.200
now, I think you could say.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.680
But also, you can't ignore the fact that Apple just announced they're transitioning their

09:38.680 --> 09:46.540
entire Mac line to a series of custom in-house built ARM-based CPUs, which by all accounts

09:46.540 --> 09:49.360
are going to be very high performance, will probably trickle down into their mobile line

09:49.360 --> 09:50.360
as well.

09:50.360 --> 09:54.880
And it seems like they've just bet the next 20 years on ARM over there at Apple.

09:54.880 --> 09:58.480
And the other side there is Apple and Nvidia don't get along.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.280
They have bad blood.

10:00.280 --> 10:06.840
This comes not too long after SoftBank bought ARM in the first place for 32 billion.

10:06.840 --> 10:10.880
So they're going to make a pretty tidy profit here if this 40 billion figure turns out to

10:10.880 --> 10:11.880
be true.

10:11.880 --> 10:12.880
Right.

10:12.880 --> 10:15.640
And there has to be a calculus there by Nvidia.

10:15.640 --> 10:18.840
This has to be a plan to transform their entire product lineup.

10:18.840 --> 10:23.500
When you think of Nvidia chips right now, you think of chips that are largely focused

10:23.500 --> 10:29.280
at the high end of the market, powerful graphics processors, or crazy fast ARM CPUs designed

10:29.280 --> 10:34.780
for machine learning inside a car dashboard, things that scientific research might use

10:34.780 --> 10:36.520
or other things.

10:36.520 --> 10:43.680
But this deal, once they own ARM holdings, kind of puts them in the whole range of the

10:43.680 --> 10:44.680
market.

10:44.680 --> 10:48.640
Not just the high end now, but also those Android Go devices we talked about.

10:48.640 --> 10:54.540
And all of those 5G towers that have ARM controllers and ARM processors in the actual antennas

10:54.540 --> 10:56.300
that help do the beamforming.

10:56.300 --> 11:02.640
And not to mention just the entire swath of devices in the IoT category and even set top

11:02.640 --> 11:08.380
boxes that all use ARM CPUs that Nvidia was never in those markets.

11:08.380 --> 11:09.380
And now they will be.

11:09.380 --> 11:14.080
Yeah, it means they'll be in pretty much all of the hardware markets from thermostats and

11:14.080 --> 11:19.100
IoT devices through to the servers that are crunching the numbers on them.

11:19.100 --> 11:23.840
And then also the GPUs that are crunching the machine learning stuff.

11:23.840 --> 11:27.980
It feels like they're just going to be in the market completely top to bottom now.

11:27.980 --> 11:32.680
It seems like every time something of this scale happens, which we have to acknowledge

11:32.680 --> 11:36.920
as we record has not happened yet, but seems lined up.

11:36.920 --> 11:41.560
When something of this scale does happen, there tends to be a reaction.

11:41.560 --> 11:46.640
And you do wonder if that reaction, I mean, maybe wonder, I hope, maybe is the better

11:46.640 --> 11:50.840
way to put it, that that reaction is an investment in RISC-V.

11:50.840 --> 11:55.760
Or if I could wave a magic wand, honestly, it would be an investment in open power PC.

11:55.760 --> 11:59.320
Because we've already got workstations and desktops with that architecture ready to go

11:59.320 --> 12:03.160
with PCI Express slots running Linux, like it's really close.

12:03.160 --> 12:08.840
It just needs to close that 10% gap and have an investment to get the CPU down a bit.

12:08.840 --> 12:15.840
I feel like there's a potential, maybe possible hope that that could happen, that one of those

12:15.840 --> 12:18.120
platforms sees an investment from this.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.120
You're a dreamer, Chris.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.120
You're a dreamer.

12:20.120 --> 12:23.040
Wouldn't it be nice though?

12:23.040 --> 12:24.040
It would be nice.

12:24.040 --> 12:28.640
And I think that we will have some competition there because it does look like RISC-V is

12:28.640 --> 12:29.640
coming along.

12:29.640 --> 12:34.000
And I think we are going to see much more powerful RISC-V boards over the next year

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
or so.

12:35.000 --> 12:41.240
But as for how much competition they will give Nvidia an arm, I can't see it being huge.

12:41.240 --> 12:44.520
They'll find a niche and it will do well.

12:44.520 --> 12:48.600
But it just seems like Nvidia now have just got it all sewn up to me.

12:48.600 --> 12:49.600
I agree.

12:49.600 --> 12:53.920
Although I'd be happy if we could just get it in the professional workstation and laptop

12:53.920 --> 12:54.920
market.

12:54.920 --> 12:57.740
Maybe a few servers, maybe a couple of little small boards.

12:57.740 --> 12:58.740
That's all I'm asking.

12:58.740 --> 13:03.600
Well, give it a few years and you never know.

13:03.600 --> 13:09.040
Linux.ting.com, get $25 off a cell phone bill at linux.ting.com.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.720
With Ting, there's no contracts, no commitments.

13:10.720 --> 13:14.280
So you can try Ting for a month with no strings attached.

13:14.280 --> 13:17.560
The average Ting bill is just $23 a month per phone.

13:17.560 --> 13:22.560
So you'll get a month of free service when you go to linux.ting.com and use our $25 promo

13:22.560 --> 13:23.560
code.

13:23.560 --> 13:27.960
And while you're there, see if your device is already compatible because it's pretty

13:27.960 --> 13:30.500
straightforward to switch over if it is.

13:30.500 --> 13:34.960
And Ting offers LTE coverage on three nationwide networks.

13:34.960 --> 13:39.440
The one that I'm using right now is Verizon Wireless and it's amazing as a backup.

13:39.440 --> 13:42.800
I have to say Verizon Wireless has one of the best networks and it's great to see Ting

13:42.800 --> 13:44.040
work with them on that.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.340
But there's two other networks to pick from as well.

13:46.340 --> 13:49.680
So you just check the coverage and choose the one that works best.

13:49.680 --> 13:53.440
If you're often around Wi-Fi, why are you paying for a monthly set of data?

13:53.440 --> 13:58.080
With Ting, you just pay for the talk, the text, and the data that you actually use each

13:58.080 --> 13:59.080
month.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.120
If you use less, you pay less.

14:01.120 --> 14:04.240
If you're working from home, you don't need to be paying for a data connection you're

14:04.240 --> 14:08.400
not using very often, especially if you know how to sync podcasts or sync your music before

14:08.400 --> 14:09.400
you hit the road.

14:09.400 --> 14:11.400
You can even save more data.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.200
Ting is not a prepaid cell phone company.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.500
At the end of the month, you're billed for the talk, the text, and the data you use.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.320
So go to linux.ting.com.

14:18.320 --> 14:19.440
Everything's laid out, explained.

14:19.440 --> 14:24.280
You can check to see if your device is compatible or grab a brand new device straight from Ting

14:24.280 --> 14:26.920
or just get a SIM card.

14:26.920 --> 14:29.680
Go to linux.ting.com.

14:29.680 --> 14:32.120
Let's talk about Mozilla again then.

14:32.120 --> 14:36.200
And this week they launched what they're calling a pilot program to give developers a way to

14:36.200 --> 14:39.520
promote their add-ons on addons.mozilla.org.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.980
Well this is how we're going to watch Mozilla die, unfortunately.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.980
And I don't say that with any levity.

14:43.980 --> 14:46.660
This really is depressing to read.

14:46.660 --> 14:48.200
And part of it is just my gut instinct.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.440
I don't normally lead with that on Linux Action News.

14:50.440 --> 14:51.900
I try to lead with the facts first.

14:51.900 --> 14:58.400
But in this case, we've been watching really what is a long string of stories that are

14:58.400 --> 15:05.040
linking together that demonstrate a collapse of direction for Mozilla and an inability

15:05.040 --> 15:09.160
to execute that has cost over 200 people their very valuable jobs.

15:09.160 --> 15:17.460
And when I read this, what I see is a pathway to monetizing add-ons.

15:17.460 --> 15:19.960
And there's a lot of things I don't like about that.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.600
But I don't even like the way they're approaching it.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.240
I don't like the way they even speak about it.

15:24.240 --> 15:28.220
It's stuffed with corporate acronyms, their own internal acronyms that they're now exposing

15:28.220 --> 15:33.440
to the public, and what appears to be essentially a plan to limit what kind of made Firefox

15:33.440 --> 15:37.000
great and instead try to monetize that strategy.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
I think you could say I'm being cynical here because the way they talk about it is this

15:40.000 --> 15:41.880
is going to support developers.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.800
That's why they're creating this program in the first place, they say.

15:44.800 --> 15:50.700
They'll have tiers where they can have unverified and manually reviewed extensions.

15:50.700 --> 15:55.860
So there is some story for people that don't want to get involved in this process.

15:55.860 --> 16:01.800
But when you get into the paid services, you get things like a verified batch on your extension,

16:01.800 --> 16:04.160
which says that it's been verified by Mozilla.

16:04.160 --> 16:10.840
You also can choose to buy sponsored placement on the Mozilla add-ons front page, sort of

16:10.840 --> 16:16.680
like an app store looking front page with your app placed right above the most popular

16:16.680 --> 16:17.680
add-ons.

16:17.680 --> 16:18.680
All right.

16:18.680 --> 16:19.680
Let me play devil's advocate then.

16:19.680 --> 16:25.160
And to make some non-Google revenue, this is surely a reasonable way to do it.

16:25.160 --> 16:26.160
I hope so.

16:26.160 --> 16:31.760
I hope it doesn't end up limiting who can participate in the add-on ecosystem and ultimately

16:31.760 --> 16:35.280
lead to just less and less interesting Firefox add-ons.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.280
We'll see.

16:36.280 --> 16:39.480
I guess only time will tell us with this particular one.

16:39.480 --> 16:43.760
But my gut read on this is being informed by like two or three signals.

16:43.760 --> 16:50.360
The first and maybe the most predominant signal is this has got very little coverage.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.800
Hardly any tech outlet is covering this.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.000
No one seems to care.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.580
That's a huge red flag for Mozilla.

16:57.580 --> 17:02.280
Number two, I will be honest, one of the things that has been an indicator for me for a while

17:02.280 --> 17:07.040
with Mozilla is how they speak to the world and the language they choose to use, the way

17:07.040 --> 17:11.800
they choose to dress it up instead of speaking plainly and directly is a warning flag to

17:11.800 --> 17:12.800
me.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.720
And the way that this thing is just packed full of acronyms, their own acronyms like

17:16.720 --> 17:22.440
AMO for the Mozilla add-on store, I'm not a fan of that.

17:22.440 --> 17:26.280
These things all kind of add up to kind of give me a bad read on this and I guess I'm

17:26.280 --> 17:29.720
combining that with their history so far and it just doesn't seem like they're trending

17:29.720 --> 17:31.000
in the right direction.

17:31.000 --> 17:36.160
If this has got a lot of interest, if there was some reaction, even negative reaction,

17:36.160 --> 17:37.360
that would be a different signal.

17:37.360 --> 17:42.120
But you're saying that they're just not relevant enough for the non-open source tech press

17:42.120 --> 17:43.760
to care about them.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.560
Yeah, I think that's kind of it.

17:45.560 --> 17:50.520
And I think you could say it feels like they've slipped out of interest from the mainstream

17:50.520 --> 17:51.520
press.

17:51.520 --> 17:52.520
Nobody's really writing about this stuff.

17:52.520 --> 17:56.320
No one's really writing about many things regarding Mozilla or Firefox right now or

17:56.320 --> 17:57.320
Thunderbird.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.480
Thunderbird's getting very little coverage at the moment.

17:59.480 --> 18:02.560
I think the interest is dropping off.

18:02.560 --> 18:07.480
Unfortunately, this is what kind of begins that slide into irrelevancy.

18:07.480 --> 18:12.480
But what else could they do except try and look for areas they can make some money?

18:12.480 --> 18:19.700
And with this particular case, to make those extensions verified, they have to go through

18:19.700 --> 18:23.740
a process of manual verification and that costs money.

18:23.740 --> 18:29.800
And so it's not unreasonable for them to ask for money from developers to pay the people

18:29.800 --> 18:31.920
whose job it is to verify them.

18:31.920 --> 18:36.960
I'd probably be willing to pay for a decent add-on if it truly improved my workflow.

18:36.960 --> 18:39.200
This is something that happens on the Apple platform.

18:39.200 --> 18:44.320
You can charge for Safari extensions, which sometimes seems ludicrous, for like $4 for

18:44.320 --> 18:45.760
a browser extension.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.640
So it better be worth it.

18:47.640 --> 18:49.960
I don't see that likely playing out here.

18:49.960 --> 18:50.960
I don't see that happening.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.400
But like I said, time will tell.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.400
I'm hopeful.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.840
The lack of interest and traction doesn't seem to be a solid indicator that's going

18:57.840 --> 18:59.520
to go that direction.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.400
But I'll take the hopeful route with you, Joe.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.400
You know, you're such an optimist.

19:02.400 --> 19:06.240
I'm known for my optimism, you know.

19:06.240 --> 19:11.080
So this next story is either going to read like a new tool in the toolbox or the next

19:11.080 --> 19:16.960
step in a corporate takeover of Linux and free software as we know it.

19:16.960 --> 19:23.980
Microsoft has seen fit to add file system access to WSL2, which I suppose could be pretty

19:23.980 --> 19:27.320
damn handy on systems that have multiple OSs installed.

19:27.320 --> 19:33.120
Yeah, so if you're dual booting Linux and Windows, specifically on two separate physical

19:33.120 --> 19:38.040
disks at the moment, but we'll see where this goes in the future, then you will be able

19:38.040 --> 19:45.140
to access your Linux disk via Windows subsystem for Linux 2 with a simple mount command.

19:45.140 --> 19:48.520
And then it will show up right there in Windows Explorer, or whatever they're calling the

19:48.520 --> 19:50.220
file manager these days.

19:50.220 --> 19:54.300
This is the opposite of what I and I know a lot of our audience probably does is I have

19:54.300 --> 19:56.920
Windows in a VM, like a VHD file.

19:56.920 --> 19:59.600
And there is, it's possible when I need to, to actually boot from that.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.680
But typically, I'm just using Linux.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.720
And here's kind of the opposite happening there.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.160
Like you said, like you said, though, there is that limitation.

20:06.160 --> 20:12.180
So just to put this concretely, it means that it is not possible to use WSL to mount a partition

20:12.180 --> 20:15.640
on a boot device, because that device is already attached to Windows.

20:15.640 --> 20:20.440
So if you are dual booting from the same disk, that disk is already in use.

20:20.440 --> 20:24.920
And the other limitation that kind of combines with this is it's a whole disk mount right

20:24.920 --> 20:25.920
now.

20:25.920 --> 20:30.360
It's not like one particular partition on that disk, it's you kind of expose the entire

20:30.360 --> 20:35.560
thing to the subsystem, which is great, kind of a cool feature.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.600
But in some scenarios can be a limitation that you need to be aware of.

20:38.600 --> 20:44.360
Yeah, but if you've got one big spinning Rust disk with all your data sets on it or something,

20:44.360 --> 20:46.240
then I could see that being very useful.

20:46.240 --> 20:50.260
The other thing that's interesting to see is Microsoft taking the effort to backport

20:50.260 --> 20:55.560
WSL to, to older versions of Windows 10, the older builds that are run like a corporate

20:55.560 --> 20:59.240
environments that initially that didn't seem like was going to happen is like this build

20:59.240 --> 21:06.000
and forward gets the new fancy WSL and the older builds are going to stick with WSL one.

21:06.000 --> 21:10.960
But it looks like via Windows update mechanisms over time, those older enterprise builds are

21:10.960 --> 21:13.360
also going to get the new WSL to hotness.

21:13.360 --> 21:18.000
Now of course, you've been able to mount Linux file systems like ext4 in Windows for quite

21:18.000 --> 21:20.440
some time using third party tools.

21:20.440 --> 21:24.880
But now we're talking built into Windows, not having to install something else.

21:24.880 --> 21:30.320
And I think they'll get over that whole disk problem soon enough.

21:30.320 --> 21:34.400
I can't see them not being able to find a workaround for that.

21:34.400 --> 21:40.360
And if it's in Windows, then it's passed all of the compliance checks and everything.

21:40.360 --> 21:45.520
You're not having to have a separate compliance form and all the rest of it for that bit of

21:45.520 --> 21:50.880
software that you're using to mount your Linux file systems, which may or may not pass compliance.

21:50.880 --> 21:51.880
And that's what we're talking about here.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.440
We're talking about the corporate environment.

21:53.440 --> 21:54.440
Yeah.

21:54.440 --> 21:55.440
We're talking about that.

21:55.440 --> 22:00.080
Not only is this built in, but it's whatever file system, the Linux kernel that they're

22:00.080 --> 22:05.480
using WSL to has support for, which could also include things like XFS and other really

22:05.480 --> 22:06.900
great file systems.

22:06.900 --> 22:07.960
So that's nice.

22:07.960 --> 22:12.640
But the other aspect that strikes me here is I picture that younger version of me that

22:12.640 --> 22:18.640
was struggling to run desktop Linux, like now I've used desktop Linux for so long that

22:18.640 --> 22:21.640
I take it for granted that I can use desktop Linux.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.240
But there was absolutely a time.

22:23.240 --> 22:28.960
I was struggling to integrate into a corporate environment and I had to have really slow,

22:28.960 --> 22:35.960
crappy Windows VMs or as I got more established, I got a separate Windows PC, but it was embarrassing

22:35.960 --> 22:38.600
because the Linux guy had to have a Windows machine and the guys would always razz me

22:38.600 --> 22:39.600
about that.

22:39.600 --> 22:44.480
And I was trying out all kinds of crazy distributions to try to get this to work.

22:44.480 --> 22:48.040
And now it's right here, all nice and tidy.

22:48.040 --> 22:52.520
I could run Linux, but if I had to do something under Windows, I could reboot, I'd have those

22:52.520 --> 22:53.520
Windows tools.

22:53.520 --> 22:58.520
Like the classic one for me back in the day was the VMware ESX management console.

22:58.520 --> 23:03.280
And if I need to get access to the stuff that's on my primary workstation OS, I have a pretty

23:03.280 --> 23:04.280
good terminal.

23:04.280 --> 23:07.520
I have a Linux user land and I can mount that drive now.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.720
I just think about that and that would have been a great tool that would have made things

23:10.720 --> 23:11.720
so much smoother.

23:11.720 --> 23:17.260
I would not have been experimenting with crazy file system drivers that caused Windows to

23:17.260 --> 23:18.720
blue screen dozens of times.

23:18.720 --> 23:22.800
But there's all these things you had to do to try to get this to work.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.880
So I think it is actually kind of significant in that sense.

23:25.880 --> 23:28.320
And that's how I would employ something like this.

23:28.320 --> 23:32.600
I can now get to my Linux stuff, which is my primary environment when I need to go into

23:32.600 --> 23:34.660
Windows to solve a problem.

23:34.660 --> 23:35.660
That's pretty handy.

23:35.660 --> 23:41.120
Well, if you're going for a proper bare metal Ubuntu installation in the corporate environment,

23:41.120 --> 23:47.080
good news because Canonical is adding active directory support to the Ubiquiti installer

23:47.080 --> 23:48.880
for 2010.

23:48.880 --> 23:53.140
Snuck just in under the wire, 2010 will support enabling active directory for logins right

23:53.140 --> 23:54.440
there in the installer.

23:54.440 --> 23:55.960
This is fantastic to see.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.660
OpenSUSE makes this pretty easy.

23:58.660 --> 24:02.680
And Fedora, I was just installing Fedora 33 last week and right there is a button to join

24:02.680 --> 24:03.680
to an active directory.

24:03.680 --> 24:07.360
This is becoming table stakes for workstation OSs.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.600
It's great to see Canonical add this.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.760
The primary reason you like to see something like this is not only can you then integrate

24:12.760 --> 24:17.920
it into an installation script, which makes automated deployments easier, but also you

24:17.920 --> 24:19.640
have to solve this yourself.

24:19.640 --> 24:22.640
And there's like three or four different ways to solve this problem.

24:22.640 --> 24:25.700
And it's nice just to have a vendor supported mechanism.

24:25.700 --> 24:29.760
And then this eventually will graduate its way into an LTS release, which then eventually

24:29.760 --> 24:34.880
ends up shipping on actual hardware, which means you buy a laptop from Dell or HP or

24:34.880 --> 24:38.680
Lenovo running Ubuntu and right out of the box, that thing can connect to your active

24:38.680 --> 24:39.760
directory.

24:39.760 --> 24:44.760
And I absolutely have people in mind that are deep into the Microsoft ecosystem, you

24:44.760 --> 24:47.360
know, they're businesses that have been around for more than a minute.

24:47.360 --> 24:52.000
And so they've invested heavily in an on-premises login system and on-premises file sharing

24:52.000 --> 24:54.240
and on-premises shared printing.

24:54.240 --> 24:59.920
And a lot of times, especially in the Pacific Northwest from the nineties forward, Microsoft

24:59.920 --> 25:05.300
was the go-to solution and they've been with it now for years.

25:05.300 --> 25:06.300
They're not switching.

25:06.300 --> 25:07.300
They're just not.

25:07.300 --> 25:11.640
The business will run that suite until the business ends and they're perfectly happy

25:11.640 --> 25:16.800
with it, but they won't even consider hardware that doesn't tie in with their active directory.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.860
It's just not even an option.

25:18.860 --> 25:23.280
From mobile to all other little devices like their key card system they have for unlocking

25:23.280 --> 25:26.020
their doors, all of it connects into AD.

25:26.020 --> 25:30.680
Even cloud infrastructure services they have with third-party vendors actually use their

25:30.680 --> 25:32.920
AD credentials to authenticate their staff and stuff.

25:32.920 --> 25:34.440
I mean, they're deep into it.

25:34.440 --> 25:38.360
Because something like this means that this is a real possibility and as soon as this

25:38.360 --> 25:41.640
starts shipping, I have somebody I'm going to recommend it to and I think they're going

25:41.640 --> 25:46.600
to give their first Linux desktop a go because they got a laptop sitting ready for it.

25:46.600 --> 25:50.000
They're just not going to do it unless it works with active directory and the kind of

25:50.000 --> 25:53.160
like guides that are available online that I sent him, it just did not work.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.160
He just didn't take it.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.360
He just, no, I'm not doing it.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.560
I'm not having this.

25:57.560 --> 26:00.040
You realize this is like two clicks in Windows, he says.

26:00.040 --> 26:01.040
Yeah.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.440
And that's what it's going to be now, which is great.

26:03.440 --> 26:04.440
Yeah.

26:04.440 --> 26:05.440
Right there at the installation too.

26:05.440 --> 26:08.200
So when, I mean, in theory, right after the first boot, you just log in with your network

26:08.200 --> 26:09.200
credentials.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.200
Yeah.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.600
Well, you'll have to let us know how you get on with that, whether you manage to convert

26:12.600 --> 26:13.600
him.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.600
Well, you know us, Joe.

26:14.600 --> 26:17.400
We're going to follow that and all the other stories that develop in the Linux and open

26:17.400 --> 26:18.400
source world.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.800
So be sure you go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe.

26:21.800 --> 26:26.080
Make sure your subscription is fresh so that way you get every new episode that comes out.

26:26.080 --> 26:30.360
And you can go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

26:30.360 --> 26:31.360
And here's a pro tip.

26:31.360 --> 26:35.800
If you haven't yet, go subscribe to the All Jupiter Broadcasting Shows feed, either from

26:35.800 --> 26:41.080
our main website or just search in your podcast catcher of choice because when we do release

26:41.080 --> 26:45.720
new stuff that may or may not be in the works, that's where it'll land first.

26:45.720 --> 26:48.000
And also spread the word that we're back.

26:48.000 --> 26:53.440
Did you know the number one source of actual marketing for podcasts is just word of mouth?

26:53.440 --> 26:54.500
Your recommendation.

26:54.500 --> 26:57.200
If you know someone who would like the show, share it with them.

26:57.200 --> 27:01.040
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

27:01.040 --> 27:05.840
You can find me at my site, chrislass.com, and you can find me at johnress.com.

27:05.840 --> 27:08.680
Thanks for joining us and we will see you next week.

27:08.680 --> 27:31.680
Take care, bye-bye.
