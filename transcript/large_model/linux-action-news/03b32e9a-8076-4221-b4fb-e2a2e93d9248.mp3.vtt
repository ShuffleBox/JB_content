00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 239 recorded on May 5th, 2022.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm Chris.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
And I'm Wes.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Hello, Wes.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.700
Let's do the news.

00:13.700 --> 00:18.720
And let's start with Google's work to add encryption to Linux's hibernation support

00:18.720 --> 00:21.560
in an effort to improve security for Chromebooks.

00:21.560 --> 00:26.280
Yeah, really, I think their goal here is to prevent userspace applications from using

00:26.280 --> 00:30.700
hibernation as a stepping stone to some kind of kernel escalation.

00:30.700 --> 00:34.940
So along with some improved userspace protections, the team is looking at mandating certain types

00:34.940 --> 00:37.320
of encryption for hibernation.

00:37.320 --> 00:42.840
The team notes that, quote, the hibernate image must be encrypted with protection derived

00:42.840 --> 00:48.380
from both the platform, something like TPM, and user authentication data like your password.

00:48.380 --> 00:55.460
It does seem the Google reviewed userspace software options for this job, such as USWSUSP

00:55.460 --> 01:01.760
or userspace software suspend, but basically came to the conclusion that userspace software

01:01.760 --> 01:06.140
helpers alone could not really meet their security requirements.

01:06.140 --> 01:11.120
So yeah, in addition to adding some userspace tooling, Google is working on kernel based

01:11.120 --> 01:16.240
encryption with support for using TPM backed keys to encrypt the hibernate image file,

01:16.240 --> 01:20.760
sealing the encryption key with a PCR based policy, and a bunch of other work to ensure

01:20.760 --> 01:25.000
that that encrypted image can actually be trusted.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.880
And then Google engineers posted an update on the kernel mailing list.

01:27.880 --> 01:31.680
And they noted, quote, a couple of patches still need to be written on top of the series

01:31.680 --> 01:36.840
and then later stating, we also need a patch that disallows unencrypted forms of resume

01:36.840 --> 01:40.280
from hibernation to fully close the door to malicious userspace.

01:40.280 --> 01:45.340
However, I wanted to get this series out first and get reactions from upstream before continuing

01:45.340 --> 01:46.920
to add to it.

01:46.920 --> 01:50.720
I would expect that this is probably going to move along at a pretty decent pace.

01:50.720 --> 01:51.960
And we'll keep an eye out.

01:51.960 --> 01:58.400
I think we'll see it in a future kernel update not too far down the road.

01:58.400 --> 02:04.100
Sticking with kernel level improvements for just a moment, a new Apple M1 CPU frequency

02:04.100 --> 02:09.060
driver has been posted by Asahi Linux's Hector Martin.

02:09.060 --> 02:13.440
This work is important if we're ever going to see Linux achieve optimal performance and

02:13.440 --> 02:17.760
good power and thermal management on Apple's shiny new silicon.

02:17.760 --> 02:21.400
Right, you want that first class experience if you're going to spend all the money on

02:21.400 --> 02:22.400
that hardware.

02:22.400 --> 02:27.280
I suppose these new patches are a complete rewrite of the earlier driver.

02:27.280 --> 02:31.560
This newly rewritten driver now avoids the memory controller performance switching, which

02:31.560 --> 02:35.920
according to Hector is, quote, doesn't make a huge difference.

02:35.920 --> 02:40.040
So it just kind of makes sense to punt that feature to the future.

02:40.040 --> 02:43.360
This new driver is based on one that seems to have been originally created by ARM, or

02:43.360 --> 02:46.000
at least they seem to own the copyright.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.960
It's called the System Control and Power Interface CPU Frequency Driver, or SCPI for short.

02:53.960 --> 02:59.320
Some of the advantages of this now standalone driver include supporting fast switching,

02:59.320 --> 03:05.280
reporting of the current CPU frequency to user space accurately, and support for exposing

03:05.280 --> 03:09.080
the higher performance processor states as turbo states.

03:09.080 --> 03:11.660
Well, those turbo states will be useful.

03:11.660 --> 03:14.440
We have one more Apple M1 platform aside.

03:14.440 --> 03:20.440
It seems they've achieved their first vulnerability that's unique to just the Apple silicon chips.

03:20.440 --> 03:26.840
It's called Uggery, I believe, I'm not sure if I'm getting that right, it's A-U-G-U-R-Y,

03:26.840 --> 03:30.620
and it's the world's first data memory dependent prefetcher vulnerability.

03:30.620 --> 03:34.040
So if you're getting kind of like a Spectre or Meltdown vibe, you're not too far off the

03:34.040 --> 03:35.040
mark.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.560
So those are side channel vulnerabilities like Spectre, but they're only capable of

03:38.560 --> 03:40.960
leaking in use data.

03:40.960 --> 03:45.880
Apple's DMP vulnerability could potentially leak the entire memory contents, even if it's

03:45.880 --> 03:49.120
not actively being accessed.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.080
They're doing it better.

03:51.080 --> 03:55.680
The researchers further stated that it seems Apple is fully aware of their discoveries,

03:55.680 --> 04:04.600
but has not yet shared plans on whether or whether or not they will deploy mitigations.

04:04.600 --> 04:10.520
Linux 5.19 is looking like another exciting release of our beloved kernel.

04:10.520 --> 04:15.960
And it seems a very useful feature is in the works, one that enables initiating firmware

04:15.960 --> 04:19.000
updates via sysfs.

04:19.000 --> 04:23.640
Intel engineers worked on this one initially for their FPGA based PCIe cards.

04:23.640 --> 04:29.240
They were building an ability to trigger a firmware update from userspace after a boot.

04:29.240 --> 04:33.900
Now this firmware upload support is being added to the virtual sysfs kernel file system

04:33.900 --> 04:38.100
so that userspace software can initiate a firmware update.

04:38.100 --> 04:43.720
For supported devices, there will now be a data loading and timeout files in sysfs that

04:43.720 --> 04:48.000
trigger firmware updates on a particular device during boot.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Here's the basic idea.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.120
You start things off by writing a one to that loading file.

04:53.120 --> 04:57.800
Then you can take the binary contents of whatever firmware blob you're trying to use for update,

04:57.800 --> 05:03.400
and then just write that to the data file, maybe using something like cat or DD.

05:03.400 --> 05:08.240
Once that's done, you go back to the loading file and you write a zero to tell the kernel,

05:08.240 --> 05:10.840
all done, it's your business now.

05:10.840 --> 05:15.520
After that, the kernel uses its existing functionality for firmware updates and does everything for

05:15.520 --> 05:16.520
you.

05:16.520 --> 05:20.000
It's really quite neat if you think about the days when we had to go reboot into free

05:20.000 --> 05:22.120
DOS to apply firmware updates or something.

05:22.120 --> 05:30.600
And now you can do kind of the same thing with little more than a bash script.

05:30.600 --> 05:34.880
And a quick heads up for you matrix admins out there, the matrix community has released

05:34.880 --> 05:40.080
a high severity fix for the matrix app service IRC bridge.

05:40.080 --> 05:43.760
The vulnerability could allow an attacker to manipulate a matrix user into executing

05:43.760 --> 05:48.320
IRC commands by having them reply to a maliciously crafted message.

05:48.320 --> 05:52.800
Yeah, it seems an incorrect handling of a carriage return character meant that the message

05:52.800 --> 05:59.320
could be sent to the IRC server verbatim, rather than as a message to a specific channel.

05:59.320 --> 06:03.600
The vulnerability has been patched in node IRC version 1.2.1.

06:03.600 --> 06:09.140
And of course, also in matrix app service IRC 0.34.0.

06:09.140 --> 06:14.000
Also in matrix related news this week, we got an update on the Gnome Foundation's complicated

06:14.000 --> 06:16.760
relationship with matrix and IRC.

06:16.760 --> 06:20.520
We'll have a link in the show notes if you want the full story.

06:20.520 --> 06:25.600
But it seems that after years of uncertainty in a polarized community split between matrix

06:25.600 --> 06:33.840
and IRC, the foundation is deciding to embrace matrix as their default and preferred platform.

06:33.840 --> 06:39.320
With IRC remaining bridged and available, but secondary in nature.

06:39.320 --> 06:44.080
The decision was reached partially based on a survey of the Gnome community itself.

06:44.080 --> 06:50.060
And from that data, it became clear that while both matrix and IRC were popular top contenders

06:50.060 --> 06:56.800
for a preferred chat platform within the community, matrix was preferred by newer members.

06:56.800 --> 07:03.560
And IRC, well, it had a far more mixed rating with some users really loving it, but other

07:03.560 --> 07:06.680
users kind of despising it.

07:06.680 --> 07:12.600
It was also noted in the post that the federated and open nature of matrix really was an extra

07:12.600 --> 07:14.680
point in its favor.

07:14.680 --> 07:19.600
Quote, people can join our conversations whether they have a matrix.org account, a KDE one,

07:19.600 --> 07:22.840
a Mozilla one, or whatever provider they want to use.

07:22.840 --> 07:26.520
It's the modern day mailing list, in effect.

07:26.520 --> 07:32.320
Now as to whether or not they take on the challenge of self hosting that instance, or

07:32.320 --> 07:40.840
paying element hosted services to do it for them, that will be answered separately.

07:40.840 --> 07:45.960
Linode.com slash LAN, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account, and you

07:45.960 --> 07:47.500
go there to support the show.

07:47.500 --> 07:51.640
And Linode has pricing that's 30 to 50% cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there that

07:51.640 --> 07:54.100
want to lock you into their esoteric platforms.

07:54.100 --> 07:58.140
It's how we've built everything we run in the cloud for the last few years.

07:58.140 --> 08:00.780
It's easy to use, and it's powerful.

08:00.780 --> 08:05.180
And Linode just recently announced that their managed database service is now generally

08:05.180 --> 08:10.040
available with support from MySQL in all of their global data centers.

08:10.040 --> 08:14.000
And I can tell you one thing that I have learned, if I can outsource something like database

08:14.000 --> 08:18.360
management to a company like Linode, that's a win-win for somebody like me.

08:18.360 --> 08:23.080
Not that we couldn't run it, or I couldn't at least talk West into running it, but honestly

08:23.080 --> 08:25.380
Linode does this stuff so well.

08:25.380 --> 08:29.360
They have super fast systems, crazy fast hard drives, 40 gigabit connections coming into

08:29.360 --> 08:30.360
the machines.

08:30.360 --> 08:34.400
They have 11 data centers around the world, but they're not just like chump data centers

08:34.400 --> 08:35.400
either.

08:35.400 --> 08:40.960
These are like pristine locations where Linode is their own ISP, and that inside those data

08:40.960 --> 08:43.920
centers, they have such a great combination of services.

08:43.920 --> 08:48.220
Instead of just like every possible thing they could ever conceive of and just take

08:48.220 --> 08:52.600
on tons of investing to do it, they focused on the stuff that you really need, and they

08:52.600 --> 08:54.000
made it work really well.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.040
And that's what they've been doing for 19 years.

08:56.040 --> 09:01.200
They have S3 compatible object storage that we use the crap out of, cloud firewalls, DDoS

09:01.200 --> 09:04.880
protection, VLAN support, and a powerful DNS manager.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.480
And one of the best things if you're in a large organization is they'll snap right into

09:08.480 --> 09:12.080
your infrastructure management, Terraform, Kubernetes, you're going to get it done over

09:12.080 --> 09:13.080
there.

09:13.080 --> 09:17.520
They don't have any problems, they have the best support.

09:17.520 --> 09:22.160
Number one feedback signal I get from our audience is I tried out Linode, it's amazing,

09:22.160 --> 09:24.320
but wow did the support blow me away.

09:24.320 --> 09:27.760
And I think people's first impressions is oh this is great, this UI is fantastic, these

09:27.760 --> 09:33.840
selections are good, performance is great, but then when you get in a bind at some point,

09:33.840 --> 09:35.440
Linode's support really comes through.

09:35.440 --> 09:39.800
So go try it out for yourself and get $100 in 60 day credit, and you can support the

09:39.800 --> 09:40.800
show.

09:40.800 --> 09:44.000
It's a great chance to learn and a great chance to support Linux Action News.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.720
So go to linode.com slash LAN.

09:47.720 --> 09:57.280
That's where you go to get $100 in 60 day credit, linode.com slash LAN.

09:57.280 --> 10:02.000
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Action News.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.760
Go see how much you could save and then take 25 bucks off of that by going to linux.ting.com.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.400
It's a smarter way to do mobile.

10:09.400 --> 10:13.880
You can start saving money right now and save money every single month.

10:13.880 --> 10:18.120
They're a mobile virtual network operator, so they work at a level above digging holes

10:18.120 --> 10:19.120
into the ground.

10:19.120 --> 10:23.840
That means Ting focuses on their customers, they focus on their value and their deals,

10:23.840 --> 10:26.560
and they really make a great competitive offering.

10:26.560 --> 10:30.840
They were recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports in 2021, and they have

10:30.840 --> 10:35.440
the same nationwide coverage, a great mix of plans, LTE and 5G data that you might expect

10:35.440 --> 10:39.600
from those duopolies, but you're interfacing with Ting and they're straightforward plans

10:39.600 --> 10:41.160
and they're no contracts.

10:41.160 --> 10:46.040
I've been a Ting customer since 2013 because it's a smarter way to do mobile.

10:46.040 --> 10:50.680
If somehow we could hit the reboot button on the mobile industry in the United States,

10:50.680 --> 10:53.760
they would have to be built like this just to be competitive.

10:53.760 --> 10:58.160
I'm so glad Ting's out there to just keep pressure on the industry to stay competitive

10:58.160 --> 11:00.440
and Ting is better than anybody else.

11:00.440 --> 11:04.480
So go try it by going to linux.ting.com and take 25 bucks off a phone.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.600
Or if you bring a phone, they'll give you $25 in service credit.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.640
Sometimes that pays for more than your first month.

11:09.640 --> 11:11.800
That's how great Ting is.

11:11.800 --> 11:15.720
So go get started today, linux.ting.com.

11:15.720 --> 11:24.700
A community project to bring Steam Deck's operating system into a generic installable

11:24.700 --> 11:30.680
format and replicate something close to the official SteamOS experience caught our eye

11:30.680 --> 11:32.200
this week.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.280
Stubbed Hollow ISO.

11:35.280 --> 11:40.120
You might ask, how is this possible considering we have yet to see the official release of

11:40.120 --> 11:41.600
SteamOS 3?

11:41.600 --> 11:46.960
Well, SteamOS is built on open source.

11:46.960 --> 11:51.520
So this is actually a community effort to sort of reverse engineer what folks are seeing

11:51.520 --> 11:58.260
and experiencing on the Steam Deck and since SteamOS 3.0 is based on Arch, build that back

11:58.260 --> 12:01.240
up themselves.

12:01.240 --> 12:05.480
The aim here, at least at first, is to offer three different installer types.

12:05.480 --> 12:10.200
You've got Bare Bones, which is just OS only, basically resembles pretty much a vanilla

12:10.200 --> 12:11.200
Arch install.

12:11.200 --> 12:15.400
There's also Game Only mode if, you know, you're a serious gamer, you don't need any

12:15.400 --> 12:21.120
Linux desktops, you just get the Steam Deck UI, which currently only works on AMD GPUs,

12:21.120 --> 12:25.960
it sounds like, and doesn't include a desktop environment, just for gaming.

12:25.960 --> 12:32.040
Or lastly, you can get the Deck Experience, which is the full SteamOS 3 experience with

12:32.040 --> 12:38.960
proper session switching, KDE Plasma, good to go, media apps, and yeah, even Chromium.

12:38.960 --> 12:44.480
I guess the people are tired of waiting for Valve to release SteamOS 3.

12:44.480 --> 12:48.040
If our GitHub sleuthing is correct, the creator of this ambitious project might still be in

12:48.040 --> 12:49.040
high school.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.060
But either way, it makes it even more impressive in my opinion.

12:52.060 --> 12:57.240
Like now the Holo ISO project has some major functionality working into boots, it gets

12:57.240 --> 13:01.760
to the Deck UI, you can even access the Plasma desktop, Wes, I'm pretty sure you gave this

13:01.760 --> 13:03.280
a go before the show.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.640
Yes, I did.

13:05.640 --> 13:09.000
You just need to go check their GitHub page, which of course we'll have in the show notes

13:09.000 --> 13:14.160
and in the usual releases spot, there's the ISO ready to download.

13:14.160 --> 13:18.080
Now you will need UEFI enabled.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.960
And they do recommend AMD hardware at the moment.

13:20.960 --> 13:25.680
Intel can work with some downgrading to get a Mesa version, not sure about Nvidia.

13:25.680 --> 13:31.320
I ultimately, not having a Deck or suitable AMD hardware just laying around unfortunately,

13:31.320 --> 13:36.560
I spun this up in a quick little QEMU virtual machine on my Intel laptop.

13:36.560 --> 13:41.320
That meant I couldn't really try out the game mode.

13:41.320 --> 13:45.480
Not sure I got the right out of box experience either because when I booted up, I was kind

13:45.480 --> 13:50.680
of just dropped to a login session, you know, normal KDE login session sort of defaulting

13:50.680 --> 13:56.040
to GameScope on Wayland, which I think would be the, you know, the Steam Deck UI experience.

13:56.040 --> 13:59.520
Did have to try, you know, I just had to try, I knew it wouldn't work, but I had to try,

13:59.520 --> 14:00.520
didn't work.

14:00.520 --> 14:05.720
Switching that over to Plasma on X11 though, that logs right in, you get the same theme

14:05.720 --> 14:11.760
that you're going to get on the Deck, otherwise, it kind of just feels like Plasma on Arch.

14:11.760 --> 14:15.080
And it comes of course with Steam pre-installed, so that's already good to go.

14:15.080 --> 14:22.280
Yeah, so it seems with Nvidia GPUs, it's pretty much not working, or if you're really savvy,

14:22.280 --> 14:24.860
there are some workarounds you might be able to pull off.

14:24.860 --> 14:30.840
And like with the Intel GPU, like you said, that isn't optimal, but if you downgrade Mesa,

14:30.840 --> 14:32.520
you can actually get everything working.

14:32.520 --> 14:38.880
Again, details are in the link in the show notes, but this is even just this idea that

14:38.880 --> 14:40.640
somebody did this out there.

14:40.640 --> 14:43.980
It's what I freaking love about the Linux community.

14:43.980 --> 14:48.800
You wanted to put SteamOS on your toaster, well now you can have SteamOS on your toaster,

14:48.800 --> 14:52.800
thanks to a developer who may not even be out of high school yet.

14:52.800 --> 14:57.960
And hopefully, this sends a message to Valve that the community is ready for SteamOS 3

14:57.960 --> 14:58.960
to be released.

14:58.960 --> 15:02.840
We're waiting any day, and of course, when they do, we'll tell you about it right here

15:02.840 --> 15:04.000
and give you our first take.

15:04.000 --> 15:09.860

15:25.860 --> 15:30.300
We are discussing our new website plans, tons of podcasting news, and it's just a great

15:30.300 --> 15:31.720
community get together.

15:31.720 --> 15:34.520
And yeah, our mumble room will be open.

15:34.520 --> 15:39.080
As for us, well, we'll be back next week, of course, with our take on the latest Linux

15:39.080 --> 15:40.840
and open source news.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.040
Thanks for joining us.

15:42.040 --> 16:09.320
And that's all the news for this week.
