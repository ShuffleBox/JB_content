00:00.000 --> 00:09.900
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 126, recorded on October 6, 2019.

00:09.900 --> 00:10.900
I'm Chris.

00:10.900 --> 00:11.900
And I'm Joe.

00:11.900 --> 00:12.900
Hello, Joe.

00:12.900 --> 00:14.180
Good to be connected with you.

00:14.180 --> 00:19.380
We kick the show off today with a project that just seems to be getting better all the

00:19.380 --> 00:20.380
time.

00:20.380 --> 00:21.380
Yeah, Nextcloud.

00:21.380 --> 00:26.060
They've released version 17, and this feels like a very enterprise-y release to me.

00:26.060 --> 00:27.740
I think there's no doubt about it.

00:27.740 --> 00:31.840
Indeed, this has to be the result of some large deployments that have come back with

00:31.840 --> 00:35.780
individual feature requests and driven some of this development.

00:35.780 --> 00:39.820
I've kind of gotten that just having some chats with the Nextcloud project.

00:39.820 --> 00:43.340
This release, though, brings a couple of major features that are in line with that.

00:43.340 --> 00:48.480
Remote wipe allows administrators to forcibly clean files from remote devices.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.980
You know, maybe like a laptop is stolen.

00:50.980 --> 00:55.960
They've made big improvements to both secure document viewing and watermarking, as well

00:55.960 --> 00:59.860
as implemented their new text editor, which they say is distraction-free.

00:59.860 --> 01:04.100
It is also a live collaborative text editor.

01:04.100 --> 01:07.540
It's one that we've done some testing with recently in-house, and it is pretty great.

01:07.540 --> 01:08.540
Supports markdown as well.

01:08.540 --> 01:11.940
And there's other things in here that are very enterprise-y.

01:11.940 --> 01:14.340
Improvements to the way two-factor authentication works.

01:14.340 --> 01:15.740
Oh, here's a big one.

01:15.740 --> 01:17.260
This is great.

01:17.260 --> 01:18.860
LDAP write support.

01:18.860 --> 01:24.060
So now you can make changes to users in an LDAP database from Nextcloud.

01:24.060 --> 01:27.180
You could, in a sense, have two-way attribution sync as well.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.180
That's massive.

01:28.180 --> 01:32.380
In the past, Nextcloud could read some of that user data, but never have any write functionality

01:32.380 --> 01:37.300
to that LDAP database, which meant you were always foreseeing changes down to Nextcloud.

01:37.300 --> 01:42.660
Now networks that use LDAP for central authentication have another option to manage users.

01:42.660 --> 01:47.500
And lastly, there's other things in there that really seem focused at large installations,

01:47.500 --> 01:53.380
but seem to have, I would say, trickle-down benefits to everyday end users or small business

01:53.380 --> 01:54.920
installations as well.

01:54.920 --> 01:57.260
You don't have to be a government to use remote wipe.

01:57.260 --> 01:58.260
That can be useful for anybody.

01:58.260 --> 02:03.100
Yeah, and that collaborative text editor, Nextcloud Text, that has got me very, very

02:03.100 --> 02:04.100
interested.

02:04.100 --> 02:07.580
I've tried it out briefly, but I think we need to do some serious testing of it.

02:07.580 --> 02:11.500
It looks like it could potentially replace Google Docs.

02:11.500 --> 02:15.500
It's not as feature-rich, but then I think a lot of the features in Google Docs we don't

02:15.500 --> 02:17.220
necessarily need.

02:17.220 --> 02:23.640
And the fact that you can either write in Markdown or just in completely WYSIWYG style,

02:23.640 --> 02:27.820
and it will create Markdown files for you, I think could solve a lot of problems for

02:27.820 --> 02:32.820
us because I hate writing in Markdown, and you hate writing in anything else.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.140
I think in Markdown.

02:34.140 --> 02:35.340
I take notes in Markdown.

02:35.340 --> 02:38.420
When I'm writing personal shopping lists, I write them in Markdown.

02:38.420 --> 02:39.860
I really do.

02:39.860 --> 02:43.160
So for me, it's like, that's a pretty big feature.

02:43.160 --> 02:47.900
And I like the idea of these being files on a file system somewhere as well.

02:47.900 --> 02:51.900
You know, with Google Drive, you can get there, but it's not just sitting on your file system

02:51.900 --> 02:53.580
on a server that syncs to your desktop.

02:53.580 --> 02:57.360
Yeah, with Google Drive, it is possible to download the files, but that's much conker

02:57.360 --> 03:00.940
than just having them right there as just a.md file.

03:00.940 --> 03:08.060
So I think we're on Nextcloud 16 right now for our main team collaboration tool, but

03:08.060 --> 03:10.360
I really don't see any reason why we won't be upgrading pretty soon.

03:10.360 --> 03:14.940
So we might do that before this week's Linux Unplugged and see how it turns out.

03:14.940 --> 03:19.120
I'm a little apprehensive now because we rely on Nextcloud so much as a tool, but it really

03:19.120 --> 03:23.820
has become a valuable tool, and when we're done recording this podcast, I will transfer

03:23.820 --> 03:27.340
the flax to Joe using Nextcloud.

03:27.340 --> 03:28.580
It's critical to what we do now.

03:28.580 --> 03:30.060
Yeah, but I'm sure Wes is on it.

03:30.060 --> 03:32.540
If it all goes wrong, you can just roll back or whatever.

03:32.540 --> 03:33.540
That's true.

03:33.540 --> 03:34.540
It's all in a container, Joe.

03:34.540 --> 03:35.540
What could go wrong?

03:35.540 --> 03:36.540
It's a container.

03:36.540 --> 03:41.420
Well, speaking of documents, the Document Foundation has come up with a new way of raising

03:41.420 --> 03:46.020
funds for the project, and to do that, they are creating the Document Collective.

03:46.020 --> 03:51.920
Yeah, and I'll remind everybody that the Document Foundation is the home of LibreOffice, and

03:51.920 --> 03:56.780
of note for this story, the foundation was established in part to ensure that commercial

03:56.780 --> 04:02.760
entities did not have undue influence on the project, which limited the types of activities

04:02.760 --> 04:04.900
they could engage in.

04:04.900 --> 04:12.180
In particular, selling branded versions of LibreOffice in app stores was something that

04:12.180 --> 04:17.420
the Document Foundation could not take on, so they looked for a way to solve this problem,

04:17.420 --> 04:18.420
and they think they have one.

04:18.420 --> 04:25.300
It is now the Document Collective, the TDC, which will engage in certain commercial activities

04:25.300 --> 04:28.940
that they say are complementary to the Document Foundation.

04:28.940 --> 04:33.580
Which pretty much means selling branded versions of LibreOffice in app stores.

04:33.580 --> 04:34.580
Right.

04:34.580 --> 04:38.180
And how they're pulling this off is a little funky, so stay with me.

04:38.180 --> 04:44.980
The new Document Collective will work with Public Software CIC, which is a European umbrella

04:44.980 --> 04:51.320
organization where Simon Phipps is its director, and they will directly engage in the app creation

04:51.320 --> 04:52.960
and putting it in the app stores.

04:52.960 --> 04:59.100
The Collective will sort of observe and watch, and then the Document Foundation will benefit,

04:59.100 --> 05:00.200
is the idea.

05:00.200 --> 05:04.980
And I guess they're working with this third party, the Public Software CIC, to move really

05:04.980 --> 05:05.980
fast.

05:05.980 --> 05:07.940
They want to get in app stores right now.

05:07.940 --> 05:12.820
So instead of waiting around for the Document Collective to get their leadership structure

05:12.820 --> 05:17.140
figured out, to get all of their policies and practices defined, they're just going

05:17.140 --> 05:22.820
to get right to work with Public Software CIC, which has raised a few eyebrows.

05:22.820 --> 05:28.040
Yeah, because Simon Phipps, who you mentioned there, is a Document Foundation board deputy,

05:28.040 --> 05:32.860
but he's also one of the founders and the only director of Public Software CIC.

05:32.860 --> 05:36.500
So there have been concerns of a potential conflict of interest there.

05:36.500 --> 05:40.640
Thankfully, the board meetings, this conversation, it's all public.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.980
It's documented.

05:41.980 --> 05:47.780
And LWN.net is doing a first class job of writing all of this up.

05:47.780 --> 05:52.380
So these are the kinds of things that, as an open community, we can watch and observe.

05:52.380 --> 05:56.160
And they are addressing people's questions in their next board meeting.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.680
This stuff's still kind of new.

05:57.680 --> 06:01.580
So it's not worth getting too upset or worked up about potential conflicts of interest.

06:01.580 --> 06:06.300
I think the reality here is, a lot of times in super small, tight communities, you have

06:06.300 --> 06:08.980
people that are wearing multiple hats.

06:08.980 --> 06:11.060
And nobody's getting super rich here, right?

06:11.060 --> 06:14.620
We're not talking like millions and millions of dollars on the line.

06:14.620 --> 06:17.220
Maybe I'm in the wrong business, actually.

06:17.220 --> 06:19.580
Maybe I shouldn't speak too soon.

06:19.580 --> 06:26.340
Well, it's worked out pretty well for Krita, selling that in the Steam and Windows stores.

06:26.340 --> 06:31.280
One of the devs actually commented on an LWN article, saying that they make eight times

06:31.280 --> 06:36.920
as much selling Krita in those stores than they get from donations.

06:36.920 --> 06:40.260
And the donations are about 30,000 euros per year.

06:40.260 --> 06:42.460
So we're not talking just pocket change here.

06:42.460 --> 06:47.080
I think there's a lot of opportunity in these app stores for free software to sell itself

06:47.080 --> 06:48.200
for a little bit of money.

06:48.200 --> 06:53.700
Because getting even $5 when you were going to get absolutely nothing is $5 earned.

06:53.700 --> 06:55.420
And they must be watching Krita.

06:55.420 --> 06:56.420
They have to be.

06:56.420 --> 06:57.420
I hope so.

06:57.420 --> 07:00.860
I hope they're watching other projects to see what they're doing to stay financially

07:00.860 --> 07:05.740
stable and viable and sustainable and try to take some action when they see something

07:05.740 --> 07:07.020
successful.

07:07.020 --> 07:11.980
Like you're saying, the Krita story shows us that not only can you fund open source

07:11.980 --> 07:21.080
software development, but the reality of that is more Windows users are using free software

07:21.080 --> 07:28.860
to do creative work, and they're using less heavily established versions in that ecosystem,

07:28.860 --> 07:30.340
like Adobe.

07:30.340 --> 07:35.600
And I don't know if the numbers are true or not, but I've heard very high numbers for

07:35.600 --> 07:40.540
Windows usage, particularly on Windows 10, because of that app store, like phenomenal

07:40.540 --> 07:42.720
success for the Krita project.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.940
That is a bit of a story that's not being talked about.

07:44.940 --> 07:47.060
Now I haven't verified the numbers, so I'm not going to share them.

07:47.060 --> 07:51.300
But if they are accurate, they are way beyond anybody's wildest expectations.

07:51.300 --> 07:53.180
So there could be some real fire to that smoke.

07:53.180 --> 07:57.300
Yeah, and I can see LibreOffice doing equally as well, because there's probably more people

07:57.300 --> 08:00.620
who need an office suite than need an art program.

08:00.620 --> 08:05.440
But it does beg the question, who would buy something that you can download for free from

08:05.440 --> 08:07.620
a different website?

08:07.620 --> 08:13.420
Does the convenience of going to the app store really make it worth spending 15 or 25 bucks

08:13.420 --> 08:14.420
for something?

08:14.420 --> 08:20.100
I don't know about 20 bucks, but I'll tell you, there is a real convenience on the Mac

08:20.100 --> 08:21.100
side.

08:21.100 --> 08:24.300
When we loaded up a system for editing back in the day, you would just open up the Apple

08:24.300 --> 08:29.540
app store, you would go to your purchase tab and just hit install, install, install, install,

08:29.540 --> 08:31.380
install, install, done.

08:31.380 --> 08:37.700
And you'd walk back in an hour, and you'd have the entire Apple editing suite installed.

08:37.700 --> 08:42.140
It's like a cheap, lazy instant restore when you have to wipe a system.

08:42.140 --> 08:44.220
You could script it, you could back it all up.

08:44.220 --> 08:47.860
But if it's in the app store, you just log into the app store, you hit that button, once

08:47.860 --> 08:50.380
you've bought it once, you've got it forever.

08:50.380 --> 08:54.540
And if you really value an office suite, in fact, some people, some people probably feel

08:54.540 --> 08:56.800
more confident when they can pay for it.

08:56.800 --> 09:01.260
If there's something I'm truly dependent on, I would rather pay for it, so that way I know

09:01.260 --> 09:02.500
it's not going to go away.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.500
I suppose.

09:03.500 --> 09:07.260
And people feel more confident getting it from the app store in their operating system

09:07.260 --> 09:11.980
rather than going to some dodgy website, even though that is, you know, the Document Foundation's

09:11.980 --> 09:12.980
website.

09:12.980 --> 09:15.980
But still, it's a thing, Windows users, it's something you and I kind of don't really think

09:15.980 --> 09:18.500
about as much on Linux, although you still have to be vigilant.

09:18.500 --> 09:26.180
But on Windows, there is a real rampant issue of fake software that messes your system up

09:26.180 --> 09:28.940
with ads and all kinds of crap.

09:28.940 --> 09:34.540
So it's a real problem where, at least with the Microsoft Windows Store, you know, it's

09:34.540 --> 09:37.900
almost 95% guaranteed to be safe.

09:37.900 --> 09:41.060
It might be crap, but it's not going to wreck your system.

09:41.060 --> 09:44.660
Yeah, and well, it seems like a very good way to fund the project as well.

09:44.660 --> 09:47.460
If they're really going to make a ton of money from this, then great.

09:47.460 --> 09:54.420
Yeah, the elephant in the room is, of course, there's nothing like this on Linux.

09:54.420 --> 10:01.340
And you don't want a project to get too hyper distracted by where, well, I mean, I guess

10:01.340 --> 10:05.020
I don't know how to say this, because you can't blame them for focusing on Windows going

10:05.020 --> 10:08.740
forward a lot more if it's the sole source of income.

10:08.740 --> 10:14.300
It's already probably just by a huge margin, I mean, just huge margins, the larger user

10:14.300 --> 10:15.300
base.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.620
So maybe this is already an issue.

10:17.620 --> 10:22.380
But I do worry that if all of your money, if you make zero revenue from one platform

10:22.380 --> 10:27.620
and all of your money from another platform, I do worry how that sets the priorities.

10:27.620 --> 10:29.020
But maybe we're already in that world.

10:29.020 --> 10:33.340
Well, I think we definitely are in that world where most of the users of these big open

10:33.340 --> 10:37.980
source projects are on Windows, but most of the devs are on Linux.

10:37.980 --> 10:41.100
And that's why it's so great when you use them on Linux.

10:41.100 --> 10:42.100
It's true.

10:42.100 --> 10:43.100
It really is great right now.

10:43.100 --> 10:47.100
I just, it feels like a very tenuous balance.

10:47.100 --> 10:51.580
And I don't know, maybe I'm just worried that Microsoft keeps upping their game.

10:51.580 --> 10:52.580
I don't know.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.340
There's probably a lot of fears at play here.

10:54.340 --> 10:59.740
But the truth of the matter is it's already the reality for GIMP, for Firefox, for Libre

10:59.740 --> 11:05.260
Office, for really any major open source tool, VLC, like I could just go on and on, they

11:05.260 --> 11:07.100
end up with way more Windows users.

11:07.100 --> 11:10.580
And so far, us Linux users haven't been left out when that happens.

11:10.580 --> 11:16.740
But I guess sometimes I sit on my porch, looking at the cloud and think, I don't like that

11:16.740 --> 11:17.740
very much.

11:17.740 --> 11:22.500
Well, something I don't like is how you get Google Apps running on the Huawei Mate 30

11:22.500 --> 11:23.500
Pro.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.060
I really did cringe when I read this this week.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.340
Yeah, we knew this was going to be a doozy.

11:28.340 --> 11:30.860
But this big of a whopper?

11:30.860 --> 11:31.860
Wow.

11:31.860 --> 11:36.180
So background here, of course, is that Huawei was unable to ship the Google Apps and get

11:36.180 --> 11:42.320
a play certified device because of the current trade restrictions in place against Huawei.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.300
So they had to come up with their own solution.

11:45.300 --> 11:51.000
But we were speculating very recently that they were likely going to leave some way for

11:51.000 --> 11:55.940
consumers in the West to get their hands on this device and then install Google Apps.

11:55.940 --> 11:58.780
And we had a couple of theories.

11:58.780 --> 12:03.520
And here we are now before most people can even get their hands on the device.

12:03.520 --> 12:09.620
And we have a super sketchy way to get Google Apps installed from a rando website.

12:09.620 --> 12:13.020
Yeah, there was speculation as to whether the bootloader would be unlockable.

12:13.020 --> 12:14.820
And it turns out, no, it's not.

12:14.820 --> 12:18.580
So there's no just installing a custom recovery and then flashing Open G Apps or something

12:18.580 --> 12:19.700
like I would do.

12:19.700 --> 12:26.420
No, you have to go to lzplay.net and then allow that website access to the Android mobile

12:26.420 --> 12:33.500
device management API, which gives that website complete and utter control over your phone.

12:33.500 --> 12:38.280
This is supposed to be used by IT departments who will assign you a phone and then they

12:38.280 --> 12:40.260
have complete control over it.

12:40.260 --> 12:43.720
This is not designed to give to a random Chinese website.

12:43.720 --> 12:48.540
So this permission, this so called device owner permission is getting accessed through

12:48.540 --> 12:55.660
essentially an API that Huawei has created that is available on the Mate 30 Pro.

12:55.660 --> 13:01.000
It's really something and how LZPlay even knew about it before the device was shipping

13:01.000 --> 13:06.900
is rather confusing because the only way you could find out currently is by reading the

13:06.900 --> 13:13.700
docs which are in Chinese and require that you have permission and sign an agreement

13:13.700 --> 13:15.380
with Huawei.

13:15.380 --> 13:21.300
Once you do that, you will discover that Huawei has implemented Android's MDM APIs and added

13:21.300 --> 13:27.740
two extra permissions for a device administrator that LZPlay is utilizing.

13:27.740 --> 13:33.660
One is MDM install sys app and the other is MDM install undetachable app.

13:33.660 --> 13:35.020
Now this is the interesting part.

13:35.020 --> 13:42.140
With this system, an application that lives in user space can be signed as a system app

13:42.140 --> 13:47.180
and the Android OS will treat it as if it's running from the read-only system partition

13:47.180 --> 13:51.260
and give it full permissions of the device forever indefinitely.

13:51.260 --> 13:56.100
There are ways you can remove it once you've done this but if you do not, this LZPlay stays

13:56.100 --> 14:00.420
and remains a full device administrator indefinitely.

14:00.420 --> 14:04.900
How many people are going to remember or even realize that they should disable it afterwards?

14:04.900 --> 14:08.560
Because what I'm picturing here is someone has bought the phone, assuming that it would

14:08.560 --> 14:12.700
have Gmail and maps and everything on there and the Play Store, then they get it out of

14:12.700 --> 14:16.700
the box and start using it and realize, well, hang on, there's no Google Apps here, somehow

14:16.700 --> 14:22.320
stumble across this website through a bit of Googling, allow it all these permissions,

14:22.320 --> 14:26.060
get the Google Apps and then just start using them and then potentially whoever is running

14:26.060 --> 14:30.940
the LZPlay has got access to their phone indefinitely.

14:30.940 --> 14:35.320
In the link that we have in the show notes, R speculates that perhaps Huawei is aware

14:35.320 --> 14:41.020
at some level of LZPlay just simply because they were so ahead of this secret API that

14:41.020 --> 14:43.900
nobody would really know about.

14:43.900 --> 14:50.080
But they contacted Huawei for a comment on that and they say, no, we have no affiliation.

14:50.080 --> 14:53.800
But this is interesting in the sense that this is something that never would have happened

14:53.800 --> 14:58.260
on a phone with Google Play, since one of the requirements of licensing the Google Play

14:58.260 --> 15:06.460
apps is the adherence to the Android compatibility definition document, which clearly outlines

15:06.460 --> 15:09.340
that you do not do things like this.

15:09.340 --> 15:12.780
And so if you want Google Play apps, you have to go through the certification and you can't

15:12.780 --> 15:14.180
do these kinds of things.

15:14.180 --> 15:19.740
And so they took the immediate opportunity to add this security flag that makes this

15:19.740 --> 15:20.740
possible.

15:20.740 --> 15:22.340
I actually think it's great.

15:22.340 --> 15:27.060
I mean, not necessarily by getting from some random website, but if I could use this myself

15:27.060 --> 15:32.060
somehow to get Google apps on a Mate 30 Pro, it would just put it on my consideration list.

15:32.060 --> 15:36.460
It goes from probably not going to spend that kind of money on a device that can't navigate

15:36.460 --> 15:41.620
me properly to if I could get that device and try it out at some point.

15:41.620 --> 15:42.620
I like that.

15:42.620 --> 15:47.540
I kind of think the idea of Android devices that don't ship by default with Google Play

15:47.540 --> 15:51.780
stuff but have the option to install them would be a perfect setup for me.

15:51.780 --> 15:52.780
Well, yeah.

15:52.780 --> 15:53.780
But not like this.

15:53.780 --> 15:55.780
Surely you want them to just have an unlockable bootloader.

15:55.780 --> 16:00.780
Well, yeah, for you, that's the easy way and probably the right way.

16:00.780 --> 16:06.340
But nothing's easier than going to a website and pushing a button, Joe.

16:06.340 --> 16:09.980
Yeah, but sometimes easy isn't best, is it?

16:09.980 --> 16:11.900
No, definitely not in this case.

16:11.900 --> 16:13.980
Not for a device that important either.

16:13.980 --> 16:18.100
But it's a very fascinating story the way those APIs got added and then LZ Play knew

16:18.100 --> 16:20.300
about it so fast.

16:20.300 --> 16:23.300
Would it be a bad move for Huawei?

16:23.300 --> 16:24.300
Google's already shut it down.

16:24.300 --> 16:25.380
They have Play Protect.

16:25.380 --> 16:27.420
They can detect the device you're on.

16:27.420 --> 16:32.860
And from what I've read, it has shut down most of the fancy Play apps like the Play

16:32.860 --> 16:33.860
Store itself.

16:33.860 --> 16:39.900
Now, even if you use that to get the Google apps on your Mate 30 Pro, the Play Store won't

16:39.900 --> 16:40.900
work.

16:40.900 --> 16:44.620
Well, I've said it before, but I'm sure Huawei are regretting their decision to lock down

16:44.620 --> 16:45.620
their bootloaders.

16:45.620 --> 16:50.780
Why don't we mention an Android Zero day right now that impacts multiple devices, including

16:50.780 --> 16:51.780
the Pixel?

16:51.780 --> 16:54.680
Yeah, this was discovered by Google's Project Zero team.

16:54.680 --> 16:59.180
And they actually did patch this vulnerability once before, but it seems to have resurfaced.

16:59.180 --> 17:02.860
I guess regressions happened back in December of 2017.

17:02.860 --> 17:05.420
They found it and fixed it.

17:05.420 --> 17:11.280
But newer versions after that have been found to be vulnerable since Android 8 or later.

17:11.280 --> 17:16.740
So Pixel 2 has affected the Huawei P20, a few Yame devices, the Moto Z3, and the Samsung

17:16.740 --> 17:21.100
S7, S8, and S9 are also impacted by this.

17:21.100 --> 17:23.120
And it appears that it is being used in the wild.

17:23.120 --> 17:27.380
So you have Google's Project Zero team who found the vulnerability, like you mentioned,

17:27.380 --> 17:32.180
and then they coordinate with their threat analysis group, TEG, which is another division

17:32.180 --> 17:39.140
in Google that goes out and does real world research to discover how this vulnerability

17:39.140 --> 17:41.140
was actually used in the real world.

17:41.140 --> 17:46.100
And they came back and said that they believe this Zero day was the work of an NSO group,

17:46.100 --> 17:51.500
a well-known Israeli-based company that sells exploits and surveillance tools to state actors

17:51.500 --> 17:53.780
as well as others.

17:53.780 --> 17:56.900
So they really do a comprehensive job now.

17:56.900 --> 18:00.620
Here's all the affected devices, here's the versions, here's where it was introduced,

18:00.620 --> 18:04.160
and then they hand it off to another team that comes back with a full report of how

18:04.160 --> 18:06.620
it was actually used in the wild.

18:06.620 --> 18:07.980
This is next level stuff here.

18:07.980 --> 18:14.020
It is worth saying that a spokesperson from NSO said, NSO did not sell and will never

18:14.020 --> 18:16.140
sell exploits or vulnerabilities.

18:16.140 --> 18:18.820
So they are completely denying involvement in this.

18:18.820 --> 18:19.820
Yeah.

18:19.820 --> 18:20.820
Who knows?

18:20.820 --> 18:25.480
Although I have a sense that Google is the kind of company that probably measures twice

18:25.480 --> 18:29.300
before they name drop somebody, but who knows?

18:29.300 --> 18:32.940
Either way, we have another quote from the Android Open Source Project.

18:32.940 --> 18:37.300
A representative said, quote, the issue was rated as a high severity on Android and by

18:37.300 --> 18:43.540
itself requires the installation of a malicious application for the full potential exploitation.

18:43.540 --> 18:47.540
Any other vectors, such as web browsers, require chaining additional exploits.

18:47.540 --> 18:54.240
And also Google has notified device manufacturers, OEMs, and we'll have the patch in the October

18:54.240 --> 18:55.240
update.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.580
Yeah, so this isn't quite as serious as it could have been.

18:57.580 --> 19:00.260
Certainly not quite as serious as I thought it was when I first read about it.

19:00.260 --> 19:05.860
I was panicking, saying, hmm, vulnerable kernels, well, they don't get updated very often, do

19:05.860 --> 19:06.860
they?

19:06.860 --> 19:07.860
Most Android phones.

19:07.860 --> 19:13.060
Well, an up and coming Android manufacturer made a lot of news this week.

19:13.060 --> 19:18.100
Microsoft, they introduced new hardware for the upcoming 2020 holiday season.

19:18.100 --> 19:22.580
Two devices that they're very proud of, one of which will be running Android.

19:22.580 --> 19:27.920
But there were some side comments that Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, made that the Verge

19:27.920 --> 19:33.540
picked up on, quote, what is the most important to us is the app model and experience.

19:33.540 --> 19:38.220
He goes on to say, how people are going to write apps for Duo Neo will have a lot more

19:38.220 --> 19:43.460
to do with each other than just writing a Windows app or an Android app, because it's

19:43.460 --> 19:46.300
going to be about the Microsoft graph.

19:46.300 --> 19:50.300
All right, get that term in your head, because Microsoft graph is something we're going to

19:50.300 --> 19:52.040
hear a lot more about.

19:52.040 --> 19:58.220
It's like a Microsoft API and services layer that appears to be OS agnostic to a large

19:58.220 --> 19:59.220
degree.

19:59.220 --> 20:03.620
Essentially, what he's admitting here is that if you can't beat and join them, and they

20:03.620 --> 20:08.860
tried with mobile and could not beat Google and Apple, and they're not going to join up

20:08.860 --> 20:14.320
with Apple, but they're going to start supporting Android, which they kind of already have to

20:14.320 --> 20:17.060
some extent, but it feels like they're going all in now.

20:17.060 --> 20:19.460
Yeah, I thought they were done making mobile devices.

20:19.460 --> 20:22.300
But here they are, they're making an Android device.

20:22.300 --> 20:29.340
And knowing how Microsoft communicates, I'm reading between the lines here a bit, but

20:29.340 --> 20:36.580
going on some experience with this, I think they had some high level talks with Google.

20:36.580 --> 20:39.540
And they said, look, we want to make this product.

20:39.540 --> 20:41.960
And we can go the Amazon route.

20:41.960 --> 20:47.860
And we can make Microsoft OS that's based on Android, or we can work together.

20:47.860 --> 20:50.020
And Google said, well, what do you need?

20:50.020 --> 20:53.140
And they said, well, we're going to need some APIs.

20:53.140 --> 20:56.100
And Google said, let's do it.

20:56.100 --> 20:59.900
And the details are pretty thin right now.

20:59.900 --> 21:06.020
But this device running Android that they showed off at their event has the Microsoft

21:06.020 --> 21:08.460
Graph APIs built into Android.

21:08.460 --> 21:12.700
I don't want to get too off topic here, but it is a ridiculous folding phone that we're

21:12.700 --> 21:13.700
talking about.

21:13.700 --> 21:14.700
Yes, it is.

21:14.700 --> 21:15.700
You're right.

21:15.700 --> 21:16.700
Yeah, you're right.

21:16.700 --> 21:17.700
We're trying to dance around that issue.

21:17.700 --> 21:19.300
But it is one of these folding devices.

21:19.300 --> 21:20.620
I mean, who knows, man?

21:20.620 --> 21:21.620
Maybe.

21:21.620 --> 21:22.620
Maybe we'll get there.

21:22.620 --> 21:25.980
But I think the big story here is this sort of position of, well, don't think about Windows

21:25.980 --> 21:26.980
so much.

21:26.980 --> 21:27.980
Don't even think about Azure so much.

21:27.980 --> 21:30.700
Think about all of these APIs and services together.

21:30.700 --> 21:33.820
That's a decent-ish way to think about it, I guess.

21:33.820 --> 21:37.220
I don't know if I buy the headline story, though, that Windows doesn't matter.

21:37.220 --> 21:41.620
I think Windows is still a nice wedge in their strategic portfolio.

21:41.620 --> 21:49.280
Yeah, I can't see them deprecating Windows any time ever, really.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.260
Not within the next 10 years, at least.

21:51.260 --> 21:53.740
You know what it is, is they want the apps.

21:53.740 --> 21:57.220
They want all those apps that are getting developed for Android and the web.

21:57.220 --> 22:00.100
That's why they switched Edge to a Blink backend.

22:00.100 --> 22:02.140
That's why they're working with Android.

22:02.140 --> 22:07.140
They want their devices and their services to have all of these apps, all these developers

22:07.140 --> 22:11.860
who need all these backend services and all these nice practical workstations and stuff

22:11.860 --> 22:13.140
that they want in that action.

22:13.140 --> 22:16.180
Yeah, and ultimately, they have to think long term.

22:16.180 --> 22:21.220
They moved far too late on mobile, and it just didn't work out for them.

22:21.220 --> 22:26.540
They have to think, well, what are the trends going to be over the next 10 to 20 years?

22:26.540 --> 22:29.640
We don't want to get left behind on that.

22:29.640 --> 22:37.840
It may require that they put their pride aside and work more with Google.

22:37.840 --> 22:43.940
You wonder if the success they're having, supposed success they're having with Edge,

22:43.940 --> 22:46.380
and the fact that Google's handled that pretty well.

22:46.380 --> 22:48.460
There hasn't been a big public spat.

22:48.460 --> 22:51.700
There hasn't been any balls taken and gone home.

22:51.700 --> 22:54.540
There seems to be a working relationship.

22:54.540 --> 22:58.580
Some of the changes Microsoft has introduced have even been upstreamed into the Chromium

22:58.580 --> 22:59.580
project.

22:59.580 --> 23:06.860
Perhaps that led the way to further collaboration, or at least maybe a willingness at management

23:06.860 --> 23:08.700
to proceed further.

23:08.700 --> 23:11.740
Now we're seeing this work with Android.

23:11.740 --> 23:12.740
Who knows?

23:12.740 --> 23:16.500
It seems like a lot of aspirations for where they think this is going.

23:16.500 --> 23:17.940
They think this is going to be the future.

23:17.940 --> 23:23.860
We'll link to that story in the show notes, but I'm a little more moderate on this one.

23:23.860 --> 23:28.580
I think it's Microsoft being extremely practical here, and they'll leverage Windows when it

23:28.580 --> 23:30.500
serves them to.

23:30.500 --> 23:36.420
Rightfully so, and they'll work with Google, and they'll use Android when they have to

23:36.420 --> 23:37.420
as well.

23:37.420 --> 23:41.060
It's very pragmatic, and it leaves a lot of a scratch in our heads because I think a lot

23:41.060 --> 23:46.740
of people in our community work from a point of passion and scratching an itch.

23:46.740 --> 23:48.220
It's just a different set of motivations.

23:48.220 --> 23:53.060
They don't really care what device consumers are ultimately using as long as it's connecting

23:53.060 --> 23:55.940
somehow to Azure and making them some money.

23:55.940 --> 23:59.380
Yeah, I think that's it.

23:59.380 --> 24:01.300
It's still like they're such a large company.

24:01.300 --> 24:02.500
There's so many people.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.040
There's so many things they're working on.

24:04.040 --> 24:08.780
They just recently announced that Microsoft Game Studios will exclusively... I could

24:08.780 --> 24:11.380
be getting this wrong, I don't follow it, but I'm pretty sure they announced they're

24:11.380 --> 24:14.100
going to exclusively focus on Microsoft platforms.

24:14.100 --> 24:18.180
Well, there's no love for Linux in there, but at the same time, that doesn't necessarily

24:18.180 --> 24:20.860
mean that as a business as a whole, they're anti-Linux.

24:20.860 --> 24:26.220
It just means that one division is taking a certain competitive strategy.

24:26.220 --> 24:31.900
I think as Linux users, we're left observing and often finding these weird mixed messages,

24:31.900 --> 24:35.100
and it creates a bit of this conundrum, like what's really going on here?

24:35.100 --> 24:42.780
When you take it all in total, you can prescribe absolutely pragmatic, economic motivated reasons

24:42.780 --> 24:43.780
for their actions.

24:43.780 --> 24:49.700
I can't remember the old idiom, but it's something to the effect of usually the simplest reason

24:49.700 --> 24:50.700
is the truth.

24:50.700 --> 24:51.700
I think that applies here.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.340
Yeah, Occam's razor, it's called.

24:53.340 --> 24:54.340
I knew you'd know, Joe.

24:54.340 --> 24:56.980
I knew it.

24:56.980 --> 24:59.340
It has been a big year, and it was a big week.

24:59.340 --> 25:03.100
I don't think I'll be getting a foldable Microsoft device running Windows X or Android anytime

25:03.100 --> 25:04.100
soon though.

25:04.100 --> 25:08.020
But looking at the photos or mock-ups, whatever they are, of that folding phone, it looks

25:08.020 --> 25:12.580
like it's two separate screens rather than one horrible plastic screen where if you breathe

25:12.580 --> 25:14.160
on it, it breaks.

25:14.160 --> 25:15.940
So maybe it'll actually be decent.

25:15.940 --> 25:18.060
They may have the winning approach here.

25:18.060 --> 25:23.260
I think LG tried something similar, and it's more like dual monitors than it is one foldable

25:23.260 --> 25:24.260
device.

25:24.260 --> 25:29.140
So all of the strain is on the hinges instead of on the screen, and that does seem like

25:29.140 --> 25:31.580
it'd be a lot more sturdy.

25:31.580 --> 25:35.220
They talk about it in their announcement about even taking some tumbles, like you can drop

25:35.220 --> 25:39.100
it a few times, whereas the Galaxy Fold's like, don't touch it too hard.

25:39.100 --> 25:40.860
Seriously, don't touch the screen too hard.

25:40.860 --> 25:41.860
You will break it.

25:41.860 --> 25:43.580
So it's a very different durability.

25:43.580 --> 25:46.860
Yeah, and who knows, maybe you'll be able to unlock the bootloader and install lineage

25:46.860 --> 25:47.860
on it.

25:47.860 --> 25:48.860
Whoa.

25:48.860 --> 25:52.780
Could you imagine if Microsoft managed to be the Android vendor that shipped the most

25:52.780 --> 25:53.900
open Android device?

25:53.900 --> 25:55.180
No way.

25:55.180 --> 25:56.500
Not the people that invented Secure Boot.

25:56.500 --> 25:57.900
That's not going to happen, I don't think.

25:57.900 --> 26:02.620
No, it seems far fetched, but you know, dare to dream is my motto.

26:02.620 --> 26:03.620
That's right.

26:03.620 --> 26:06.060

There's a lot of talk these days about containers and reverse proxy and what it all is, is explained

26:18.620 --> 26:21.900
in an extras we just released, go to extras.show.

26:21.900 --> 26:25.640
The basics of reverse proxy and some projects, I'll explain, and we'll have a link in the

26:25.640 --> 26:26.640
show notes too.

26:26.640 --> 26:30.460
