00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,680
Episode 213, recorded on October 31st, 2021.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,680
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,680
And I'm Wes.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,680
Hello, Wes.

6
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,680
Let's do the news.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,160
We start this week with some cheap hardware, well, if you can manage to get your hands

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,160
on it.

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,840
It's been nearly six years now since the Raspberry Pi Zero was first announced, and

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,920
combined, the Zero and its wireless-enabled big brother, the Zero W, have sold almost 4

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,640
million units.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,000
And this week, the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W was announced.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Priced at just $15, the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W uses the same SoC as the launch version

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,520
of the Pi 3, but it has its ARM cores slightly clocked down to 1 GHz to reduce thermal load,

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,720
alongside 512MB of LPDDR2 SDRAM.

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,920
The Zero 2W is equipped with a mini HDMI port, microSD card slot, hardware encode and decode

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:06,360
of H.264, and nice to see this, a hack-compatible 40-pin I.O. header.

18
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,280
But what might be the most impressive thing here, and really great for those of you who've

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,480
already invested in a previous Pi Zero, Simon Martin, who designed both that original Zero

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:21,960
and Zero 2W, has been able to squeeze all this extra performance into the original Zero

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
form factor.

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,200
So that means almost all cases and accessories designed for Zero should work just fine with

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
this new board.

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,800
People are loving that online, and this makes me think there's two things about this.

25
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,760
One of them is thermal, but before I get to that, I also want to note that this also brings

26
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,320
the entire lineup to 64-bit now.

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,120
That's maybe a small step for one product, but it's a giant leap for Pi kind.

28
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,160
And this Pi 2Zero shows us that they are really working on their thermal game.

29
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,720
Thermals are always a challenge when you're trying to package more performance into the

30
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,880
same small package you had before.

31
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,940
It's an age-old problem.

32
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,280
You want to up the performance, but you want to cram it into the same space.

33
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,960
So how do you dissipate that heat?

34
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,200
Well, similar to what we've seen in other recent Pi products, like my Pi 400, the Zero

35
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,840
2W doubles down on some of their lessons learned recently and uses thick internal copper layers

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,200
to conduct heat away from the processor.

37
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,760
Yeah, they mean business.

38
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,320
Apparently, if you hold them both in your hands, you can actually feel that difference

39
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,320
in weight.

40
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,720
Now, sadly, actually getting your hands on one is going to be a challenge for a while.

41
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,680
Zero 2W is not immune to the current global semiconductor shortage, so as a result, they

42
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,720
expect to ship roughly 200,000 units this calendar year and a further 250,000 to follow

43
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,540
in the first half of 2022.

44
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:58,200
But they do say, quote, we aim to keep Zero 2W in production until at least January 2028.

45
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,960
In news that I just quite never get used to saying, Microsoft's Edge browser on Linux

46
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,000
has finally reached official stable status.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,320
As reported by Sophos, and now covered in several other outlets as we record, a stable

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:19,240
version of Microsoft Edge for Linux is now available in the official Microsoft Edge Linux

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,240
repositories.

50
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,840
Now, it is version 95, just like the latest stable release on Windows.

51
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,960
There's been no official announcement by Microsoft as we record this.

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,800
It's possible this news cycle just got ahead of them, maybe hit the repo and people started

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,660
reporting about it, or it's possible they just don't intend to make a very big deal

54
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,660
out of it.

55
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,280
But if you've been using the development builds of Edge, it should just auto update with the

56
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,360
rest of your system when you do an update again with the repo you already have set up

57
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
in most cases.

58
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,240
And you can actually visually tell when Edge has been updated, because that little beta

59
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,800
badge on the icon will finally go away.

60
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,120
Now if I recall, Chris, you started trying out Edge right after it was released.

61
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
I did too.

62
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,280
Did you manage to stick with it though?

63
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
Not at first.

64
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,120
It was definitely an on and off thing, but as Chrome or Firefox would give me a fit about

65
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,000
something I was trying to do.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,440
For example, this typically would happen was, as you know, we'd be using some WebRTC VoIP

67
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,560
app to do a show and Chrome would be spinning up my CPU and causing my fans to go crazy

68
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,320
and Firefox would have some issue with the screen sharing or some weird Google policy

69
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,000
had been applied to my Chrome browser.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,120
And so just different things would come up and I would try Edge.

71
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,120
Yeah, you need a spare browser sometimes.

72
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,400
And I would find that Edge handled those workloads better.

73
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,280
And so over time, Edge has kind of picked up more and more things I use it for because

74
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,440
in my use, I've just found that it seems to use fewer resources doing the same job.

75
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,600
And it has that Chrome compatibility that I need in some of those WebRTC apps.

76
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,080
So that's kind of been a winner for me.

77
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,280
Plus, I have issues with Chrome where it's constantly nagging me to sign into a profile

78
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,280
when I log into a Gmail inbox for like one of the shows and I just don't get that garbage

79
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,400
with Edge.

80
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,040
So overall, I've, you know, I found the experience to be above average, I'd say, and I find myself

81
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:14,160
on most systems now installing it alongside Chrome and Firefox.

82
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,800
Have you used it much after you gave it that initial go?

83
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,400
No, I'll be honest, I kind of got installed, played around with it, seemed like Chrome

84
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,900
but with a Microsoft stamp and so I didn't keep using it.

85
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,880
But I can definitely appreciate how, yeah, having an extra browser lying around.

86
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,020
And I'll be honest, I've not really been impressed with Chrome lately.

87
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,140
Some of those same things you mentioned, they're definitely bugging me.

88
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,440
So maybe a less Google version might be what I need.

89
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,220
Yeah, I don't think you're going to see Linux users in mass switch, though.

90
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,560
You might see some enterprise adoption, some educational space adoption where people need

91
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
compatibility.

92
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,720
But you know, I mean, I don't think this is going to be like a revolution at the regular

93
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Linux user level.

94
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,480
No, I don't think so.

95
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,360
I mean, I'm going to keep using Firefox.

96
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,800
But hey, don't we want a little browser diversity?

97
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,040
Unfortunately, Edge doesn't quite count there.

98
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:06,840
Well, transitioning from open source web browsers to open source messaging systems and clients,

99
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,840
we noticed EMS the folks behind the element matrix chat client and the matrix hosting

100
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,240
service have announced element one this week, which promises to bring matrix WhatsApp signal

101
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,560
and telegram chats all into one place.

102
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,520
The service is priced at just $5 a month, and they're offering quote, a fully managed

103
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,320
consumer experience with the bridging and hosting managed by the experienced EMS team.

104
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,960
They say it's also basically unlimited usage with some reasonable fair use limits to protect

105
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
against bots.

106
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,960
Yeah, that's pretty understandable.

107
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,560
You see, the fundamental value pitch here is that you have a lot of chats online, potentially.

108
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
I sure do.

109
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Yeah.

110
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,800
And you'd like all of it in one place.

111
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,320
And for some of us, that is a very tempting product.

112
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,800
And you could even see them expanding this beyond just what I've listed and even maybe

113
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,800
going to things like Discord, Slack, Mattermost and lots of other services that can just kind

114
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,680
of layer them on top of this.

115
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,860
But there are some trade offs.

116
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,200
Bridges support conversations, invites, images and attachments, but they don't support voice

117
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,960
or video calls between platforms, although your voice and video attachments should be

118
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,600
supported just fine.

119
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,680
And the big caveat that right now, end to end encryption is broken in order to make

120
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
the bridges work.

121
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,120
But the EMS team do say they've taken some efforts to reduce that risk, noting, quote,

122
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,480
the bridges operate in Elements trusted EMS environment with no content scanning or data

123
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
mining.

124
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,920
And of course, element to element or any other matrix app supporting end to end encryption,

125
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,340
those conversations are still end to end encrypted by default.

126
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,480
They also support voice and video calls.

127
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,720
If you're someone who manages a lot of online communities or just participates in them,

128
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,000
and you've been thinking about getting into the world of matrix, this might really be

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
a no brainer.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,960
I can't really think of an easier way to get started with this kind of stuff and have a

131
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,560
nice hosted, curated experience.

132
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,400
Yeah, in fact, setting a matrix can be one of the barriers to adoption and they've really

133
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,120
packaged it all together here.

134
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,440
I also think that you're right, Chris, when you say expect more bridges coming soon.

135
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,760
This might be a nice funding method where EMS gets the money and some of that gets directed

136
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,360
to developing better or future bridges.

137
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,680
I see the hint quite strongly at this on their blog saying, we'll be listening carefully

138
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,020
to all feedback to see how to develop element one in the future.

139
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,500
It could be the people want more bridges added, or perhaps end to end encryption for existing

140
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:35,000
bridges might be deemed more important, or something else entirely, either way, or all

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
ears.

142
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,840
I like what you're saying there about this being a way for users to fund EMS and element

143
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,280
development and that reminds me a little bit of the Nebuchadnezzar setup for Home Assistant.

144
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,740
That's the commercial organization above Home Assistant and they offer a Home Assistant

145
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,380
remote access service that's very reasonably priced.

146
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,320
It's full of features and it gives Home Assistant great functionality that you're going to kind

147
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,760
of want anyways, which is the check of a few boxes and a monthly subscription.

148
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,960
But what you're really doing with that subscription is you're financing future development of Home

149
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,000
Assistant.

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And so by subscribing to this element one, you'd be helping the element organization

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,840
continue as just a, you know, a matrix fan.

152
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,720
So I think this isn't quite ready for me, but I am definitely on the fence.

153
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,280
I'd love to see a Slack bridge set up.

154
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,520
Ooh, that would be nice.

155
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
Yeah, yeah.

156
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,280
Or just a one click Discord bridge.

157
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,480
Then I could close a few more Electron apps.

158
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,800
That's one of the main goals here.

159
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,040
One Electron app to rule them all, Wes.

160
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,200
And while we're talking about the element chat app, the chat client added export support

161
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,340
this week in version 1.91.

162
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,960
So with this latest release, you now have the ability to export chat from all rooms

163
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,760
and DMs on the element web and desktop apps.

164
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,600
And this new export ability was definitely one of the development team's most upvoted

165
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,560
features and the implementation looks pretty solid.

166
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:58,160
Not only are you able to choose what you want to export, the current timeline, the entire

167
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,680
timeline, or just a specific number of messages, but you're also able to choose how to export

168
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:16,100
them HTML, plain text, or my favorite, JSON.

169
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,880
As we record on a Sunday evening, Linux 5.15 is scheduled to be released just momentarily.

170
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,600
This merge window opened back in September and there's some particularly interesting

171
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,160
new features and changes in this release, including one that I've been dreading for

172
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
weeks.

173
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,200
Oh, we're going to touch on that.

174
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,880
But first, one of the most talked about new features is the new NTFS3 file system driver,

175
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,040
originally developed by Paragon Software.

176
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:48,840
It feels like we've been reading about this one forever, but now it's finally shipping.

177
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,160
Something else we've been following closely, the Apple M1 IOMMU driver was added, among

178
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,800
a whole bunch of other ongoing work, adding support for Apple's new SoC in the kernel.

179
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,120
But the feature I know you've been dreading, this release merges in KSMBD.

180
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
So good up, Wes.

181
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
I know you're loving this.

182
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,940
This is just crazy to me, an in kernel Samba file server.

183
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,840
You know, SMB, the Windows file sharing protocol that accepts remote connections over the network

184
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,520
is now built into the kernel.

185
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,780
And we're trying to figure how this is even going to work.

186
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,720
Is the kernel going to open up an interface and accept Samba connections over a new interface

187
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:32,520
like Wirecard does, or is it going to actually open up the remote port somehow on your machine?

188
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,280
Like, we don't know, but I have a suspicion we'll find out.

189
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:42,960
And the overall message is this isn't a replacement for traditional Samba for most workloads.

190
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,040
But KSMBD does promise a high performance and more lightweight option for those of you

191
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
who might need it.

192
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,120
Hey, nothing better for my local network.

193
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,320
And really, I suppose that shouldn't be too hard to do when your service is built right

194
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,160
into the kernel.

195
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,640
But that's definitely something we're going to test.

196
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:07,640
Interestingly, Samsung's use case for this is lightweight file sharing on Android devices

197
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,780
and other embedded applications.

198
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,720
But we just think it might be fun to try a Raspberry Pi file server.

199
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,960
I do have to admit, I am looking forward to that.

200
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:22,840
Another big thing that lands in 5.15 is the preempt RT locking code.

201
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,480
This represents the bulk of the previously outstanding real time patches for the Linux

202
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
kernel.

203
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,860
So the mainline kernel is getting close to holding all of the needed real time functionality.

204
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:38,040
And while real time functionality isn't needed by most of us, this is going to be huge for

205
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,100
the workloads that do require it.

206
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,160
We know that our friends at SpaceX and JPL, for example, maintain their own patch sets

207
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,920
to Linux just to enable real time functionality on the devices they deploy Linux on.

208
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,920
And this has been a long time coming.

209
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,520
The preempt RT patch has been available for every long term stable version of the kernel

210
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,040
since kernel version 2.6.11.

211
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:07,960
AMD users also get a lot of nice to haves, including future AMD users of the Steam Deck.

212
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:13,400
The AMD Van Gogh APU audio driver was merged in 5.15, and the Steam Deck will be among

213
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,360
the first hardware to actually benefit from it.

214
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,720
Really, there is just a lot going on in 5.15.

215
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,080
And as always, Michael Haribol has a great write up at Ferronix, which we'll have a

216
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,740
link to in the show notes.

217
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,720
And of course, the kernel never sleeps.

218
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:36,040
With the release of 5.15, the merge window for 5.16 will open up pretty much immediately.

219
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:44,000
And there are already many exciting things in the works.

220
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,480
You know why I use Linode?

221
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,920
Because I'm not my own ISP.

222
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,740
I don't have 11 data centers around the world.

223
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,120
And I haven't been deploying servers in the cloud for 18 years.

224
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,520
I have been deploying servers for more than 18 years.

225
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,080
And that's also another reason why I use Linode.

226
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,520
Because I'm really blown away by what they have here.

227
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,480
First of all, the pricing is just fantastic.

228
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,120
It's 30% to 50% less than the major duopoly hypervisors out there.

229
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,680
They've made a really great dashboard.

230
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,960
I think they revved it like a couple of years ago, and now they've just been really kind

231
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,960
of iterating on something really great because it's definitely a refined product.

232
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,000
It manages to strike the balance between simple but give you advanced functionality when you

233
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
need it.

234
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,680
On top of that, they have a really flushed out API and a command line client you can

235
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,600
use on your OS of choice to interact with Linode and do things like upload files or

236
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,880
manage a box, create a snapshot before you make a change.

237
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,320
What I actually do on my machines is usually I have a dropdown terminal on whatever desktop

238
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,520
I'm using.

239
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,120
And almost always, that's where I have the Linode command line tool.

240
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,320
So if I'm working on something, I can have that just ready to go.

241
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,160
Drop that down, execute a command like a snapshot or something real quick, and I'm good to go.

242
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,000
Linode is really focused on giving you a simple but powerful setup.

243
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,640
And you can go with one of their pre-built stacks, just one click deploy kind of thing,

244
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,600
and they got a lot of good ones for that.

245
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,240
That's a great way to learn too.

246
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,800
Or you can go the DIY route.

247
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,960
I've actually found guides in Linode tutorials on how to replace their images with my own

248
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,940
custom Linux image, which I use for this VPN monster that I run for my LTE connections.

249
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,280
But I was just blown away that they were like, not only did they allow it, but they were

250
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,440
showing me how to do it.

251
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,220
That's what's so cool about Linode.

252
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,220
They're in it for the tech.

253
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,280
Like I mentioned, they are their own ISP.

254
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,840
When they did that years ago, it was like kind of like a controversial thing that Linode

255
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,360
was using Linux as firewall and routers.

256
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,600
Like what are they doing?

257
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,800
They can't do that.

258
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,380
And now it's just as commonplace.

259
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,560
You see Linux in so many places in our network infrastructure now.

260
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,240
So many people now do infrastructure as code.

261
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,160
Linode was all about that early on.

262
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,320
When things really got cooking in the cloud age, it was really when virtualization became

263
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,520
available.

264
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,140
And that was something Linode saw coming before anybody else.

265
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,240
They saw what you could do with that before anybody did because they're geeks and they

266
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,800
played around with this stuff.

267
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,520
And now their service has a bunch of great features.

268
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,560
I love their S3 compatible object storage.

269
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,280
They have cloud firewalls, DDoS protection, VLAN support.

270
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,160
Of course, they've got a powerful DNS manager because you're going to need that.

271
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:11,480
Kubernetes support, super fast networking, and a lot more.

272
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,760
So go get that $100 and really get an opportunity to try it.

273
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,340
Linode.com slash LAN.

274
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:22,640
Go there, get $100 on a new account for 60 days, and you support the show.

275
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,280
It's real easy to support the show and try out something great.

276
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,360
Linode.com slash LAN.

277
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,080
And Linux Action News is made possible by Ting.

278
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,080
Linux.ting.com.

279
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,520
Ting's my mobile service provider.

280
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,440
They are a mobile virtual network operator.

281
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,000
That means they focus on the customer support and a great value.

282
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,460
Go find a plan that fits at linux.ting.com.

283
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,680
They have a special deal going on right now as I record this.

284
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,600
So if you're listening around release time, they have very special rates up to 35% off

285
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,040
on some of their plans.

286
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,880
You go to linux.ting.com and get $25 in credit so you could really start working here.

287
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,560
Ting has fantastic plans and rates.

288
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,640
Whatever you need, a little bit of data, a lot of data, unlimited talk, unlimited text,

289
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,960
they've got plans for you.

290
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:10,820
And they've got simple to understand terms and no contracts.

291
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,020
It's simple to switch to Ting.

292
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,480
You go to linux.ting.com.

293
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,660
Pretty much any phone's going to work with Ting because they support multiple networks.

294
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,760
They have coast to coast network coverage, and they know.

295
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,760
They know the math.

296
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,560
They know what works best in your area.

297
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
So you go to linux.ting.com.

298
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,240
You check out your current phone.

299
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
You create an account.

300
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,080
You pick a plan that fits you just right.

301
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,600
And seriously right now, if you're listening around release time, they've always got great

302
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
pricing.

303
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,200
But if you're listening around release time, go to linux.ting.com.

304
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,480
Check out these prices.

305
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,020
If you fit everything, everything looks good, they're going to send you a SIM card.

306
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,460
You get that right away.

307
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,560
You pop that in your phone, and you get activated online in minutes.

308
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,920
You can pretty much do this entire process without having to talk to customer support

309
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,980
because they've got a great dashboard.

310
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,720
But if you do need customer support, they've got the best in the business.

311
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,220
That's something Ting is really focused on, so they've got you covered there.

312
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,300
They send you that SIM card.

313
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,300
You pop it in.

314
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,300
You get going.

315
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,520
But if you ever have any trouble, they're there for you.

316
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,720
The next generation of Ting Mobile is incredible.

317
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,200
And right now, the pricing is record breaking.

318
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,240
So get started.

319
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,320
Try it out and see why I've been using it forever.

320
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:15,520
Go to linux.ting.com.

321
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,760
Big change for network administrators is under development in Red Hat land.

322
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:26,040
It appears the Fedora project, and further downstream, Red Hat Enterprise 9, is considering

323
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,320
removing support for the Network Information Service, or NIS.

324
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,520
NIS solved a problem in the early days of Unix networking as the number of systems grew,

325
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,720
became quite a chore to copy around your Etsy password file and keep those UIDs in sync.

326
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,240
NIS was one of the first forms of any sort of single sign-on on a local network.

327
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,000
Not to date myself, but I'm sure some of you out there already know this.

328
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,820
But when I was entering the industry, some folks still called it Yellow Pages.

329
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,440
And I always liked that name better.

330
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,400
But as you can probably guess, trademark issues ensued.

331
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,900
And the entire Unix community was just exhausted by trademark fights by this point.

332
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,840
So the name was just changed to NIS, and then later NIS Plus in 1992.

333
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,640
However, you'll still end up using functions and commands that start with YP.

334
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,280
Now these days, Linux systems still carry NIS support, and the PAM Unix authentication

335
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,480
module supports it as well.

336
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,880
And distributions still package the various NIS utilities.

337
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,400
At the beginning of October though, Bjorn Esser suggested that Fedora, at least, might

338
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,800
stop doing so soon.

339
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,680
Esser is working on a project to replace PAM Unix, which also receives unfortunately little

340
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,840
attention these days, with a more straightforward alternative.

341
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,680
One of the things that would make this work a little simpler would be to just drop support

342
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,340
for NIS.

343
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,560
So he wanted to know if anyone was still actually using it.

344
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,140
Well, and they did hear from some of those users, didn't they?

345
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,680
They seem to exist, surprise, surprise.

346
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:02,320
LWN notes they were perhaps most aptly described by Stefan John Smogen, who said, quote, the

347
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,700
places I've seen it still being used are in universities run by people who learned sysadmin

348
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,320
in the 90s and early 2000s.

349
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Ouch.

350
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,160
That burns a little less.

351
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,480
He goes on to say, it's a lightweight system that is simple to set up and tends to be the

352
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,960
go to stick for a lot of we put this together in 1999 with rail six, and we've upgraded

353
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,240
it ever since type places.

354
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,800
Another commenter was quick to ask whether any simple alternatives might exist.

355
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,960
Unfortunately, the answer would appear to be no.

356
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,880
Smogen responded, there is LDAP, but that isn't light.

357
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,680
And there is Kerberos, but that isn't easy.

358
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:47,520
He added that an awful lot of the quote, cool kids just defer to one of the large service

359
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,440
providers for authentication services these days, a solution that doesn't seem likely

360
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,280
to appeal to anybody who's been making the effort to keep NIS running all these years.

361
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,180
That's really the no win scenario part of this because you could you could kind of mitigate

362
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,800
this with modern infrastructure management tools.

363
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,980
Of course, you could you could deploy free IPA and essentially replicate a lot of Active

364
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,840
Directory type functionality.

365
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,200
But none of that is as easy or quick to set up as NIS.

366
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,580
In my opinion, it's a bit of a shame that some universal distro agnostic and universally

367
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:29,600
supported Active Directory alternative hasn't been built and adopted by the wider community.

368
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,640
From my days in both the industry of enterprise and banking and my days in education and

369
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,920
IT support there, I think I can make a pretty solid argument that a lack of a drop in replacement

370
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,200
for Active Directory.

371
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,920
In other words, something that's practically built into every distro, not having that has

372
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:53,740
slowed adoption in the enterprise and in the education desktop market easily.

373
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,120
And I think it's left the low end market open for Chromebooks to just dominate.

374
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,080
And of course, Windows continues to dominate in the higher end market.

375
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,240
I think I have to agree.

376
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,480
We do see more and more Linux desktops in the enterprise over time, but they tend to

377
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,720
be rolling their own solutions for user management if you're lucky enough to have user management

378
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,960
at all.

379
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:19,220
But given that it seems round nine will not support NIS, and even if Fedora punts this

380
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,320
change for maybe a cycle or two, the final days are nigh.

381
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,320
Well, support still remains for now.

382
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,240
I mean, what an incredible run over the decades from the very early days of network Unix to

383
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:37,120
2021, no matter how you slice that, that is an extremely impressive run.

384
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,140
And I feel nostalgic for something that may be fading away just a little bit.

385
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,320
Maybe that's why it made it in today's episode.

386
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,040
And while we're speaking of Fedora on Tuesday's Linux Unplugged project, lead Matthew Miller

387
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:55,200
will join us for our exit interview with Fedora 34 and our review of Fedora 35, which is scheduled

388
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,160
to release Tuesday, November 4th.

389
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:02,280
Yeah, that'll be episode 430 of Linux Unplugged, and I think that's going to be a really good

390
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,280
conversation.

391
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,960
But we'll keep an eye on everything going on in the world of Linux and open source.
