00:00.000 --> 00:16.480
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.480 --> 00:20.080
This is episode two, recorded on May 21st, 2017.

00:20.080 --> 00:21.080
I'm Chris.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
And I'm Joe.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.080
Hello, Joe.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.000
Now, I really hope we screw this one up.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.560
This is when we have to make all of our mistakes.

00:26.560 --> 00:30.000
This is just the second episode, so everything has to be wonky.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Okay?

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
Do you mind?

00:32.000 --> 00:34.320
No, I'm sure it'll be absolutely perfect, don't worry.

00:34.320 --> 00:38.960
Yeah, we all have a chance to make it perfect if we participate in the future.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.240
And that's what Ubuntu is going for.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.240
Boy, that is...

00:41.240 --> 00:42.240
There we go.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.240
See, leave that in there.

00:43.240 --> 00:44.560
That'll be an example of things I'll never say in the future, Joe.

00:44.560 --> 00:45.560
Right there.

00:45.560 --> 00:46.960
I'll never do that transition again.

00:46.960 --> 00:47.960
Because it doesn't matter.

00:47.960 --> 00:54.780
The Ubuntu desktop team is discussing openly their plans for GNOME in Ubuntu 17.10.

00:54.780 --> 00:57.800
And it appears to be much more than what Mark led us to believe, huh, Joe?

00:57.800 --> 00:59.840
I wouldn't go as far as to say much more.

00:59.840 --> 01:00.840
Really?

01:00.840 --> 01:03.720
Because I had been led to believe that it would be basically stock GNOME.

01:03.720 --> 01:05.080
Yeah, me too.

01:05.080 --> 01:11.800
And they are at least considering the possibility of various GNOME extensions and customization,

01:11.800 --> 01:16.020
but I don't think it's as much as it appears to be.

01:16.020 --> 01:20.240
Because it's one thing to consider it, it's another to actually implement it.

01:20.240 --> 01:21.440
Okay, fair enough, fair enough.

01:21.440 --> 01:27.880
So this is, a lot of this information is coming from OMG Ubuntu, Ken Van Dyne, who's been

01:27.880 --> 01:30.200
with Canonical for a long time as a software engineer.

01:30.200 --> 01:34.480
He's now part of the Ubuntu desktop team, which, by the way, there's an Ubuntu desktop

01:34.480 --> 01:35.480
team.

01:35.480 --> 01:36.480
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

01:36.480 --> 01:37.480
Yeah, there is a team.

01:37.480 --> 01:38.480
Okay, we've got that.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.480
That's a good sign.

01:39.480 --> 01:40.480
That's a good sign.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.860
And he was chatting with Joey over at OMG Ubuntu, and Joey was asking him several questions.

01:44.860 --> 01:50.360
And he was a little evasive, and I don't mean to say evasive in a bad way, but he was evasive

01:50.360 --> 01:54.220
because they don't know all of the answers yet, but he says they're considering a few

01:54.220 --> 01:59.320
tweaks here and there to ease users into the new experience.

01:59.320 --> 02:04.240
And so they're looking at things like how to work the existing Unity look into client

02:04.240 --> 02:07.620
side decorations and a few other things.

02:07.620 --> 02:10.480
It looks to me like a lot more than just stock GNOME.

02:10.480 --> 02:15.800
Again, I don't think a lot is the right word because there's no HUD, there's no global

02:15.800 --> 02:16.800
menus.

02:16.800 --> 02:24.780
Yeah, there's no global menus, it essentially is moving ambience over to GNOME with client

02:24.780 --> 02:26.320
side decoration support.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.680
That's really essentially it, plus then maybe a few extensions on top.

02:29.680 --> 02:34.240
I don't know, I think that there are going to be a lot of Unity users who are not going

02:34.240 --> 02:39.360
to be happy with the fact that this is their default setup.

02:39.360 --> 02:46.280
They are going to upgrade potentially from 16.04 to 18.04, or maybe they're on the six

02:46.280 --> 02:50.960
monthly ones and they're going to upgrade from Unity and it's going to be the Unity

02:50.960 --> 02:53.080
story all over again, isn't it?

02:53.080 --> 02:57.320
You had it from GNOME 2 to Unity, suddenly, bam, it's right in front of you.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.520
This is, everything's different.

02:59.520 --> 03:03.320
And now you're going to have it again, you've got no desktop, I mean, unless they implement

03:03.320 --> 03:08.360
these extensions where you can have a desktop and stuff, I mean, that to me, okay, it might

03:08.360 --> 03:11.440
seem like a small thing, but to me it's quite a big thing.

03:11.440 --> 03:17.640
You go from having a desktop on which you can put things to a wallpaper that you can't

03:17.640 --> 03:20.200
even right click on and do anything with.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.940
So the two things that jump out at me is it seems that most users that would be on a six

03:23.940 --> 03:28.800
month release cycle would probably be cognizant of the changes coming down the pipeline.

03:28.800 --> 03:33.640
And then the other folks that are switching, maybe just now, or they're upgrading their

03:33.640 --> 03:37.640
installations like you're talking about, I wonder if they're actually doing an upgrade.

03:37.640 --> 03:42.400
If they don't take the Unity 7 packages out of the repo, then wouldn't they just upgrade

03:42.400 --> 03:43.920
and keep using Unity?

03:43.920 --> 03:49.840
Well, it looks like Unity is going to be an option if you log out and then you've got

03:49.840 --> 03:51.200
that drop down menu.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.400
So they're going to be in the repo then, the packages?

03:53.400 --> 03:54.400
Yes.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.720
So you've got the option to go for that, but by default, they're going to push GNOME.

03:57.720 --> 03:58.720
I wonder.

03:58.720 --> 04:03.240
So the other thing that jumps out at me is where do they draw the line?

04:03.240 --> 04:05.740
So they have a survey that they've launched right now.

04:05.740 --> 04:10.720
They're asking folks via OMG Ubuntu what they would want to see in an Ubuntu GNOME.

04:10.720 --> 04:14.400
And the things that they're considering are what extension should we just bake in?

04:14.400 --> 04:18.040
And they're asking some great questions.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.700
And they're getting some great traction.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.880
But I think I have an issue with the premise.

04:21.880 --> 04:22.880
What's the issue?

04:22.880 --> 04:26.340
I don't blame them for being uncomfortable shipping a stock GNOME setup.

04:26.340 --> 04:31.320
But if you stack too many extensions into this thing by default, you could be asking

04:31.320 --> 04:32.320
for a bad time.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.720
Now, they're going to be able to update the packages altogether.

04:34.720 --> 04:38.080
So in theory, you'd have a deb for one of the extensions, and it would get updated when

04:38.080 --> 04:39.980
the GNOME desktop gets updated.

04:39.980 --> 04:43.360
But I do worry that if we go too far, one of the...

04:43.360 --> 04:44.360
So I'll give you an example, Joe.

04:44.360 --> 04:48.800
The one that really bothers me is the applications menu extension, which is under consideration.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.720
This dramatically changes the interaction with GNOME.

04:51.720 --> 04:55.440
So when you hit the super key, instead of getting the applications full screen overlay

04:55.440 --> 05:00.200
with the overview, you get a menu that drops down that would remind you of Cinnamon.

05:00.200 --> 05:04.760
And this is a pretty big deviation from the standard use of GNOME that you would find,

05:04.760 --> 05:07.320
say on Fedora, or OpenSUSE, or Arch.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.840
Yeah, but it sounds good to me.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.760
But I'm an XFCE user, aren't I?

05:10.760 --> 05:11.760
So what do you expect?

05:11.760 --> 05:13.680
I suppose it would sound good to a lot of...

05:13.680 --> 05:18.480
It would sound good to a lot of new users, but it totally is forfeiting now the collective

05:18.480 --> 05:21.280
benefit of all of us using a common interface on Linux.

05:21.280 --> 05:26.120
Yeah, but isn't the beauty of GNOME the fact that you do have these extensions, and that

05:26.120 --> 05:31.320
unlike Unity, which was like it or lump it, this is how it is, with GNOME you can have

05:31.320 --> 05:32.320
a bunch of extensions.

05:32.320 --> 05:34.600
You can do whatever you want to it.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.280
I mean, Cinnamon started with a bunch of extensions.

05:37.280 --> 05:42.160
Yes to a degree, but like my uncle always tells me, with great power comes great responsibility.

05:42.160 --> 05:46.280
And I feel like you do have to be careful that you don't completely alter the user experience

05:46.280 --> 05:47.280
from upstream.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.520
You see, I don't agree with that.

05:48.520 --> 05:57.000
I think that this is a chance for Canonical to put their stamp on GNOME and using extensions

05:57.000 --> 05:59.120
which are commonly used.

05:59.120 --> 06:03.280
This isn't some crazy third-party forked code or whatever.

06:03.280 --> 06:10.040
It's their chance to stand out against Fedora and other distros that use basically stock

06:10.040 --> 06:11.040
upstream GNOME.

06:11.040 --> 06:13.640
Yeah, I suppose you're right, Joe, and as long as they're using something that's already

06:13.640 --> 06:17.620
out there in the open that the community is already working on, at the end of the day,

06:17.620 --> 06:20.920
it's not that big of a deviation, and it's something that could be easily turned off.

06:20.920 --> 06:22.560
You know, they're getting a lot of results.

06:22.560 --> 06:29.640
They've had over 16,000 responses taking the 1710 GNOME desktop survey, and they want more.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.920
In fact, they're pleading, go out to omgabuntu.com.

06:32.920 --> 06:37.200
Even if you're not an Ubuntu user, if you have some experience with the GNOME desktop

06:37.200 --> 06:40.080
and you want to give them your take on it, I think it's worth taking the survey.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.080
I've done it.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.080
Have you taken the survey, Joe?

06:42.080 --> 06:43.520
Yes, I answered one question.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.520
I have to know.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.520
Buttons on the right, please.

06:45.520 --> 06:48.400
Oh, yes, buttons on the right, please.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.400
I completely agree.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.280
The GNOME extension, I didn't know enough about.

06:51.280 --> 06:55.940
They all seem fairly sensible to me, but I didn't want to have an influence over something

06:55.940 --> 06:58.120
that I shouldn't, if you know what I mean.

06:58.120 --> 07:02.080
But if you do use GNOME, then definitely, you've got no excuses, really.

07:02.080 --> 07:06.320
I mean, I think it was Popeye and Wimpy were saying this on the Ubuntu podcast.

07:06.320 --> 07:11.760
If you don't have your say, and then they don't implement the stuff that you want, then

07:11.760 --> 07:13.400
you can't really complain, can you?

07:13.400 --> 07:17.720
Ubuntu reminds me of many years ago, when they were looking for input on other aspects

07:17.720 --> 07:19.480
of the Ubuntu desktop.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.680
It's in some ways history repeating itself.

07:21.680 --> 07:24.920
And one of the things that's repeating, it was one of my favorite things as a Linux user

07:24.920 --> 07:25.920
in the past.

07:25.920 --> 07:28.960
Well, speaking of many years past, let's talk about Windows Server.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.840
You used to get involved in that, didn't you?

07:30.840 --> 07:31.840
Oh, I did.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.240
Many, many, many servers I've set up.

07:34.240 --> 07:38.480
And imagine if you could have had the Windows subsystem for Linux on a Windows Server.

07:38.480 --> 07:39.740
Wouldn't that have made things easier?

07:39.740 --> 07:40.740
A game changer.

07:40.740 --> 07:45.040
So many times over the years, I came up with different methods and approaches to get SSH

07:45.040 --> 07:48.120
on a Linux, or I'm sorry, on a Windows box, where I could connect from a Linux box and

07:48.120 --> 07:53.420
do SCP and things like that, or get event logs into syslog and get some sort of equivalency

07:53.420 --> 07:56.600
of cron, because I really was not a big fan of the Windows scheduler.

07:56.600 --> 08:02.200
And now, somebody way down in the depths of Microsoft has heard my pain.

08:02.200 --> 08:06.560
And they've announced that coming soon to Windows Server will be the WSL, which is

08:06.560 --> 08:10.520
the Windows subsystem for Linux, on Windows Server.

08:10.520 --> 08:16.100
I mean, this is just more admission from Microsoft that Linux has won, isn't it?

08:16.100 --> 08:19.080
The proof will be in the pudding, Joe, on how people actually end up using it.

08:19.080 --> 08:22.680
Will it just be a way to move some of your favorite bash scripts over to Windows and

08:22.680 --> 08:27.000
automate things, or are you going to end up with people running SSH servers and maybe

08:27.000 --> 08:29.620
NGINX on Windows?

08:29.620 --> 08:34.660
It either way is going to be a huge boon for Linux admins that have to manage these systems,

08:34.660 --> 08:36.580
say under virtualization.

08:36.580 --> 08:38.420
That's got to be a very common use case.

08:38.420 --> 08:42.960
And now, they can take some of their same scripts and manage the Windows boxes.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.440
That's the really big part that Microsoft is pushing.

08:45.440 --> 08:49.600
And they're really trying to downplay the fact that you could probably also run services.

08:49.600 --> 08:52.420
I don't know for sure, but it seems very likely.

08:52.420 --> 08:55.760
But you've got much more experience than me in enterprise, right?

08:55.760 --> 09:00.320
My understanding is that enterprise, desktop-wise, you're basically stuck with Windows.

09:00.320 --> 09:05.180
And that's why the subsystem makes much more sense on Windows 10 desktop.

09:05.180 --> 09:10.520
But in terms of Windows Server, isn't Linux much more prevalent there already in the enterprise?

09:10.520 --> 09:15.560
And so it's kind of not as important to be able to have Linux-y stuff on Windows because

09:15.560 --> 09:18.160
you can just run a Linux server if you want to.

09:18.160 --> 09:22.100
To me, it seems like this is also Microsoft trying to make containers like Docker work

09:22.100 --> 09:28.040
on Linux, trying to make the super nano versions of Windows that can run inside VMs or run

09:28.040 --> 09:29.040
VMs.

09:29.040 --> 09:34.640
And they're trying to also answer the market that is running Windows servers on Linux hosts.

09:34.640 --> 09:39.400
And to me, as a system administrator, if I could run a script to move some files around

09:39.400 --> 09:43.480
that I can run on a Windows system and I can run on a Linux box, that's a huge win.

09:43.480 --> 09:47.680
And it's going to make me more comfortable implementing a Windows system because I can

09:47.680 --> 09:51.860
move that knowledge now over to the Windows box to administer it.

09:51.860 --> 09:55.880
It's fascinating to see Microsoft acknowledge a reality where Linux has a huge presence

09:55.880 --> 09:56.880
on the server.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.240
And they're trying to make Windows more amenable.

09:59.240 --> 10:03.660
When I was in the enterprise way, way back in the early start, when I first got started,

10:03.660 --> 10:08.960
I watched Microsoft do this same exact thing with Novell's NetWare.

10:08.960 --> 10:12.420
They really made it easy to use Windows with NetWare.

10:12.420 --> 10:16.080
They created their own NetWare client that was integrated into the Windows operating

10:16.080 --> 10:17.080
system.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.280
They made it possible for Windows clients to connect to NetWare shares.

10:20.280 --> 10:24.760
They made it talk all the IPX protocols required to communicate with NetWare.

10:24.760 --> 10:30.760
It was really smooth the way at each layer of the Windows experience from the user layer

10:30.760 --> 10:34.080
to the server layer to the network communications layer.

10:34.080 --> 10:39.960
Over time, they added support for NetWare until NetWare started to decline in market

10:39.960 --> 10:40.960
share.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.720
And then they started removing support for NetWare.

10:43.720 --> 10:48.400
And then it became more inconvenient and more inconvenient to work with NetWare systems.

10:48.400 --> 10:52.200
And I don't think that's what Microsoft's doing here, but it does strike a similar tone.

10:52.200 --> 10:58.280
Well, you know, I was concerned, I spoke about it on last week's show, about how this

10:58.280 --> 11:02.920
subsystem for Linux is eating away, potentially, at Linux market share.

11:02.920 --> 11:08.080
I just don't see that with adding it to the Windows server, because I think that people

11:08.080 --> 11:12.920
who are really serious about Linux on the server are using it anyway.

11:12.920 --> 11:17.200
And so I think it's probably a good thing, because it's basically adding a little bit

11:17.200 --> 11:21.640
more Linuxy-ness to people who have to use Windows server.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.940
So I don't see it as a threat.

11:23.940 --> 11:25.400
I see it as a good thing, basically.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.400
Yeah.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.940
Yeah, I think I completely agree with your take on it.

11:27.940 --> 11:32.240
The only place I could see it being a bad thing is if you just needed that one open

11:32.240 --> 11:33.340
source application.

11:33.340 --> 11:37.160
Like I was saying earlier, you just need NGINX.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.560
This sort of solves that problem for you.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.660
Now you don't have to hassle with a VM or even a container.

11:41.660 --> 11:45.040
You can just get your Windows server that already has everything else, install NGINX,

11:45.040 --> 11:46.040
and call it good.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.840
Yeah, I suppose.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.540
We should do a quick follow-up on last week.

11:49.540 --> 11:57.180
We talked about how Fedora, SUSE, and Ubuntu are going to be in the Windows app store.

11:57.180 --> 12:02.020
And therefore, we assumed they would be on Windows 10 S. Well, Microsoft have clarified

12:02.020 --> 12:05.280
their position on this, and that is not going to be the case.

12:05.280 --> 12:10.640
So the stripped-down, gimped version, I suppose you'd say, of Windows 10 that's going to be

12:10.640 --> 12:14.280
coming out soon, where you can only install stuff from the app store, is not going to

12:14.280 --> 12:19.900
support anything that is command line or basically powerful.

12:19.900 --> 12:22.020
So it's not going to work.

12:22.020 --> 12:26.520
So this idea that students are going to be using these machines and are going to be able

12:26.520 --> 12:31.560
to use Linux or at least the subsystem for Linux, that is not going to happen.

12:31.560 --> 12:36.140
Yeah, they emphatically say so on their MSNDN blog.

12:36.140 --> 12:40.600
They literally bolded and put an exclamation mark on, no, this is not going to happen.

12:40.600 --> 12:43.560
They really want us to know this is not going to happen.

12:43.560 --> 12:47.500
It does strike me this is a policy and not a technological limitation.

12:47.500 --> 12:51.640
So if they felt all of a sudden it would be competitively advantageous to them, they could

12:51.640 --> 12:53.120
flip the switch and turn it on.

12:53.120 --> 12:58.200
Well, you say technological reasons, but there's no reason why you can't install any Windows

12:58.200 --> 13:02.040
application on Windows 10 S. It's all policy.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.640
And the policy kind of makes sense to me.

13:04.640 --> 13:09.840
I mean, it seems weird to agree with Microsoft, but if you're going to have a lockdown system,

13:09.840 --> 13:14.440
you don't want to have something that's going to fuck with the underpinnings of the operating

13:14.440 --> 13:16.020
system potentially.

13:16.020 --> 13:20.240
So you're not going to have basically the command prompt at all.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.360
You're not going to have regedit, I wouldn't have thought.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.560
And that makes a ton of sense.

13:24.560 --> 13:29.040
If you want to have something that's going to be strong and stable, to use a phrase that

13:29.040 --> 13:33.480
UK listeners will hate, that's the way to do it.

13:33.480 --> 13:38.640
And it makes sense to me that running this Linux stuff, it's not for the kind of users

13:38.640 --> 13:41.040
who Windows 10 S is aimed at.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.040
Yeah, fair enough.

13:42.040 --> 13:43.040
I think you're completely right.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.040
Yeah.

13:44.040 --> 13:47.280
Well, we don't want to spend too much time talking about Windows, so let's talk about

13:47.280 --> 13:50.080
another app story.

13:50.080 --> 13:56.000
And this one has a lot of aspirations for bringing third-party developers to desktop

13:56.000 --> 13:57.000
Linux.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.860
Our friends over at elementary OS have an update to their Loki release.

14:00.860 --> 14:04.480
And for those of you that don't run elementary OS as your daily driver, they've had updates

14:04.480 --> 14:06.840
in December, January, February, and March, and April.

14:06.840 --> 14:12.340
So they've been consistently updating the OS, but this is sort of one update that brings

14:12.340 --> 14:16.440
everything together, including the latest Granite, which is sort of like the go-to spot

14:16.440 --> 14:22.680
for developers, and their big App Center, which is pay for what you want apps.

14:22.680 --> 14:26.280
So if you want to pay $1 or you want to pay $10, it's your choice.

14:26.280 --> 14:27.560
Sort of humble bundle style.

14:27.560 --> 14:31.600
Yeah, or you can pay zero, as I tested, and that is working.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.080
So that's all good.

14:33.080 --> 14:37.520
Yeah, I mean, this is a great idea in theory, and I'll get back to why it's a great idea

14:37.520 --> 14:42.880
in theory in a second, that if you're a developer, you can put your software on there, and people

14:42.880 --> 14:48.160
can either download it for free to try it, or they can chuck you a few dollars if they

14:48.160 --> 14:49.540
want to.

14:49.540 --> 14:53.960
And the good thing about the implementation of it is there are no logins, there's no stored

14:53.960 --> 14:57.840
credentials or anything, you just put in your card details, it's handled by Stripe, which

14:57.840 --> 15:01.160
let's hope is secure, and then it just gets dealt with.

15:01.160 --> 15:04.840
And you could say, well, hang on, surely you need an account to get those apps back if

15:04.840 --> 15:09.280
you reinstall or you install on another machine, but well, you can just put in zero, right?

15:09.280 --> 15:11.020
So there's no problem there.

15:11.020 --> 15:15.840
You can support the developers however often or not you're able to.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.720
So in theory, this is great.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.880
In practice, it's not ready yet.

15:20.880 --> 15:24.560
They've pushed it into the distro and it's not ready.

15:24.560 --> 15:32.720
I mean, I downloaded the ISO, installed it on a very standard box, which is just an i5

15:32.720 --> 15:36.280
with no discrete graphics, nothing out of the ordinary.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.880
Trisco runs perfectly on this machine, put it that way.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.680
That's how standard it is.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.200
And it just didn't work.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.200
Hang on.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.200
How do you mean it didn't work?

15:46.200 --> 15:47.200
Okay.

15:47.200 --> 15:53.000
So I click on the App Center icon, it thinks about it for a bit, then nothing happens.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.800
What kind of GPU is in the system?

15:54.800 --> 15:55.800
It's Intel graphics.

15:55.800 --> 15:56.800
Oh, okay.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.920
And so I was like, what the...

15:58.920 --> 16:00.560
And I tried a few times, okay.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.240
I put it on a Kaby Lake system, I did not have this problem.

16:03.240 --> 16:07.860
Well, I mean, this is a second gen i5, so it's pretty old, pretty standard hardware.

16:07.860 --> 16:14.920
So I thought, well, I wonder what happens if I do a apt-get update and dist-upgrade,

16:14.920 --> 16:18.360
did that, rebooted, and then it worked perfectly.

16:18.360 --> 16:23.880
So the thing is, so I did get to try it out, but the point is this, elementary is a distro

16:23.880 --> 16:26.320
that is aimed at new users to Linux.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.800
I mean, there's no doubt about that, right?

16:28.800 --> 16:34.320
It's supposed to be a user-friendly, smooth experience.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.300
And yet I'm having to drop to a terminal to fix the problem.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.360
And this was on the release ISO?

16:39.360 --> 16:40.360
Yeah.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.360
Wow.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.520
I did not run into that problem.

16:43.520 --> 16:44.840
Yeah, okay.

16:44.840 --> 16:48.280
So that seems like that was a bug that you hit.

16:48.280 --> 16:49.280
I did not run into that.

16:49.280 --> 16:53.000
I was much more impressed because once I launched the App Center, not only was it to pay for

16:53.000 --> 16:58.240
once you want apps, but the other thing they've added is you can install proprietary drivers.

16:58.240 --> 17:01.020
So I needed the Intel microcode for this laptop.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.240
And that was just listed right there as an update inside the App Center.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.240
Easy peasy.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.920
I clicked Update All, got it, and I was done.

17:06.920 --> 17:11.000
Yeah, I was offered that and installed it, and that's worked perfectly again after I'd

17:11.000 --> 17:13.160
fixed that little bug in it.

17:13.160 --> 17:17.560
But it just feels that it's just a little bit too early to push it into the mainstream.

17:17.560 --> 17:18.560
Yeah.

17:18.560 --> 17:22.960
Daniel would tell you, the founder of elementary OS, Daniel would tell you that this is a minimum

17:22.960 --> 17:23.960
viable product.

17:23.960 --> 17:28.400
They built something they can put out the door that they feel works, that has the basic

17:28.400 --> 17:30.040
transaction process.

17:30.040 --> 17:34.920
The other thing you'll note is missing from this is the ability to review or rate applications.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.880
That's obviously something they're going to add, but it just wasn't ready to ship yet.

17:37.880 --> 17:41.120
Yeah, I can't help but think they should have hung on a bit, personally.

17:41.120 --> 17:45.680
I think that they've got their unstable PPAs that you can add, and if you want to test

17:45.680 --> 17:49.720
it for them, there's a huge community doing that for them.

17:49.720 --> 17:53.120
And I think that was the place to put it in, not into the mainstream release yet.

17:53.120 --> 17:57.280
I think give it another bit of development, a bit more testing.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.000
But I'm quite a conservative person.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.640
I'm sitting here running Xubuntu 16.04, so you know.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.760
Fair enough, but I think part of this is they want to start making some money.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.960
They want to give developers a way to make money.

18:07.960 --> 18:12.520
They want to start paying for the developer that they have working on this application.

18:12.520 --> 18:16.860
And so the minimum viable product was the ability to sell apps.

18:16.860 --> 18:21.820
And then adding reviews or other functionality down the road would be something that once

18:21.820 --> 18:25.320
this thing's making money, you fund that development with.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.000
Yeah, okay, that does make a lot of sense, actually.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.980
And I would very much like to see that stuff happen quickly, though.

18:30.980 --> 18:34.080
On the road, sounds a bit nebulous and abstract.

18:34.080 --> 18:38.360
Let's hope they've got a proper roadmap for how quickly this is going to happen.

18:38.360 --> 18:41.640
You know, that's why I've been taking the elementary OS project more seriously in the

18:41.640 --> 18:45.240
last couple of years, because they really do seem to do this right.

18:45.240 --> 18:49.280
So they get together, they fund the sprint where they build the product and the spec.

18:49.280 --> 18:53.580
The first they spec it, then they get a basic product built, then they dev it.

18:53.580 --> 18:58.640
And in this case, they even brought somebody in their own team up to an actual paid developer

18:58.640 --> 19:00.760
position to work on this thing.

19:00.760 --> 19:02.920
So that way, they have dedicated internal resources.

19:02.920 --> 19:08.360
So as a business, they also shift the business to support something like this that they launch.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.240
And then they get it out the door, they actually ship it.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.240
It didn't take them a year.

19:11.240 --> 19:14.640
Like, it only took them a few months from the crowd funder to actually get it out there

19:14.640 --> 19:19.800
to start making money to pay for the investment that the business has taken the risk to take.

19:19.800 --> 19:20.800
Yeah, that's true.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.240
I was surprised at how quickly it came out, to be fair.

19:23.240 --> 19:26.320
So yeah, well done to them for that, I suppose.

19:26.320 --> 19:36.080
I think just a couple more weeks, maybe, but then you end up with Debian, don't you?

19:36.080 --> 19:37.080
I agree.

19:37.080 --> 19:38.880
It does feel very early.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.800
But I guess you do have to start somewhere.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.420
You know, it strikes me, Joe, it's sort of interesting that they're the only distribution

19:43.420 --> 19:44.760
doing this.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.020
Isn't that interesting now?

19:46.020 --> 19:47.880
Because Canonical is not really doing this anymore.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.440
There's no click and run.

19:49.440 --> 19:54.320
Ubuntu Mate has the welcome screen, the boutique, but that's all free stuff.

19:54.320 --> 19:57.960
There's nobody that's really trying to make a profit from an app store on the Linux desktop

19:57.960 --> 19:58.960
anymore.

19:58.960 --> 19:59.960
They're the only ones.

19:59.960 --> 20:03.800
Yeah, you kind of have to ask yourself, why is that?

20:03.800 --> 20:08.520
If Canonical couldn't make it work, has the technology really changed, have times moved

20:08.520 --> 20:10.720
on for the better for the Linux desktop?

20:10.720 --> 20:13.680
Well, I will give the elementary guys this.

20:13.680 --> 20:18.720
The buying experience is 10 times smoother and much more streamlined on the elementary

20:18.720 --> 20:21.360
app center than it was on the software center under Ubuntu.

20:21.360 --> 20:25.400
Do you remember how you had to have an Ubuntu one account and put your address in there?

20:25.400 --> 20:28.760
This on the elementary OS app center, it's just a little stripe pop up.

20:28.760 --> 20:29.920
Just give me your payment information.

20:29.920 --> 20:30.920
Done.

20:30.920 --> 20:31.920
Yeah, it is much simpler.

20:31.920 --> 20:36.800
So hopefully that was the barrier to entry before and hopefully this will take off because

20:36.800 --> 20:41.720
I know people, I heard a lot of stories about developers wanting to make a go of the Ubuntu

20:41.720 --> 20:43.000
one and it never worked out.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.040
So fingers crossed for elementary.

20:48.040 --> 20:51.440

You find it all at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

21:43.200 --> 21:51.440
Okay, now I know you're a big fan of Alexa and the Amazon Echo and you've got them controlling

21:51.440 --> 21:55.960
all sorts of things in the studio and we've talked about this, haven't we, that where's

21:55.960 --> 21:56.960
Minecraft?

21:56.960 --> 21:57.960
Why haven't they delivered?

21:57.960 --> 22:00.880
Well, it looks like they are finally ready to ship.

22:00.880 --> 22:06.400
This week as you're listening to this, they're going to start shipping out to people, but

22:06.400 --> 22:11.920
it's going to be an advanced prototype, not the final thing and oh yeah, you have to pay

22:11.920 --> 22:14.560
a little bit more delivery.

22:14.560 --> 22:19.360
This happened to me, so I was a backer and I've been getting emails all week and it has

22:19.360 --> 22:22.400
been like salt in the wound, last chance, last chance.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.400
I get one every day.

22:23.400 --> 22:29.200
It's my last chance to spend an additional $250 to get what I backed.

22:29.200 --> 22:33.800
This has happened to me several times now, but it really stings because I know at home

22:33.800 --> 22:39.600
I could set up a Raspberry Pi 3, a USB microphone and a speaker and I basically have the same

22:39.600 --> 22:40.600
thing.

22:40.600 --> 22:45.040
I'm never compelled to go dump an additional $250 and I can't be the only one feeling this

22:45.040 --> 22:46.040
way.

22:46.040 --> 22:47.040
What level did you back it at then?

22:47.040 --> 22:49.440
You know, Joe, it was so long ago.

22:49.440 --> 22:55.200
I tried to find out, but it was so long ago, I don't recall, but I backed it at a level.

22:55.200 --> 22:59.100
I can tell you this, I backed it at a level where I could get a piece of hardware soon

22:59.100 --> 23:02.360
enough that I could be one of the first people on a podcast talking about it.

23:02.360 --> 23:04.320
That's the level I backed it at.

23:04.320 --> 23:05.320
Yeah.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.600
And yet you still haven't had anything from them.

23:07.600 --> 23:08.600
No, no.

23:08.600 --> 23:10.640
I don't really at this point expect much.

23:10.640 --> 23:15.760
In fact, Mycroft themselves said that anyone that wants a polished retail level experience

23:15.760 --> 23:20.360
should probably wait around, oh, I don't know, until February 2018.

23:20.360 --> 23:21.920
That does not look good, does it?

23:21.920 --> 23:22.920
No.

23:22.920 --> 23:29.560
I mean, with Amazon moving forward, with Google obviously moving forward and rumors of Apple

23:29.560 --> 23:34.080
shipping a Siri in a tube, I got to imagine that this is going to be two years too late.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.080
Yeah.

23:35.080 --> 23:40.520
But when they did the crowd funder, and let's not forget they did two, an Indiegogo and

23:40.520 --> 23:43.560
a Kickstarter, that was the time to deliver it.

23:43.560 --> 23:47.340
I do want to be really wrong about this because I really would love to see them succeed.

23:47.340 --> 23:53.560
So I say all of this with the hope that maybe long term they have a chance, but right now

23:53.560 --> 23:56.300
they themselves admit they have a long way to go.

23:56.300 --> 24:01.800
In their recent post, they say we're currently working on their if then, then that skill,

24:01.800 --> 24:05.260
Pandora functionality, Netflix integration and more.

24:05.260 --> 24:10.200
They're also working to improve the overall voice interaction, making it easier for users

24:10.200 --> 24:12.660
to manage skills and settings and et cetera.

24:12.660 --> 24:18.060
So they have quite a ways to go because right now the competitors on the market can do all

24:18.060 --> 24:20.560
of these things and they've been able to do these things for a while.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.440
And this is where open source often finds itself, don't you think?

24:23.440 --> 24:25.900
Yeah, I think that's fair to say really.

24:25.900 --> 24:31.520
And it is just massively too late in this particular case.

24:31.520 --> 24:35.560
Even with open source, it can be a little bit lagging behind and maybe not quite as

24:35.560 --> 24:39.000
good, but it's just far, far too late.

24:39.000 --> 24:47.280
I mean, that said, I am somewhat baffled that anyone would want to talk to a computer.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.120
I mean, I know that you like to control your lights and stuff.

24:50.120 --> 24:55.060
You've got like kind of a relevant use case for it, but the kind of person who sticks

24:55.060 --> 24:59.380
it in their house and just asks it the weather and the news and stuff.

24:59.380 --> 25:03.240
I mean, like even you using it for something practical.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.920
Don't you feel like a bit of a dickhead to talk into it?

25:05.920 --> 25:07.320
I definitely did at first.

25:07.320 --> 25:11.680
So the way you feel is 100% the way I felt before I tried it.

25:11.680 --> 25:12.680
And that's why I tried it.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.960
I wanted to challenge myself because I thought it was ridiculous.

25:15.960 --> 25:19.520
And to be honest with you, Joe, you have Google Assistant if you're on Android and you've

25:19.520 --> 25:23.880
got slow mo if you're on the iPhone and they can do a lot of this stuff.

25:23.880 --> 25:27.800
So I thought this was going to be a obvious loser.

25:27.800 --> 25:32.560
And I would agree if you just use it for asking it basic information, there's no point.

25:32.560 --> 25:33.640
There's really no point.

25:33.640 --> 25:38.120
However, if you do integrate it in with components in your household or in your studio or where

25:38.120 --> 25:42.840
you work, or when Dell made the case with the Edge X Foundry stuff in a manufacturing

25:42.840 --> 25:45.580
plant, then I start to see a lot more use cases for it.

25:45.580 --> 25:48.660
And I could see where Mycroft would actually be more useful.

25:48.660 --> 25:53.840
And I also imagine a scenario where you could have home entertainment integrators that could

25:53.840 --> 25:55.760
integrate Mycroft throughout the house.

25:55.760 --> 26:00.840
Because one of the great things about Mycroft is you can have a central system, if I recall.

26:00.840 --> 26:05.040
One central brain, sort of Iron Man style, where you have Jarvis in one spot and all

26:05.040 --> 26:09.600
of the devices are connected to that one central brain.

26:09.600 --> 26:14.600
Picture a huge mansion full of entertainment systems and smart devices with one central

26:14.600 --> 26:16.440
Mycroft managing it all.

26:16.440 --> 26:18.040
That's a future I could dig.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.040
Yeah.

26:19.040 --> 26:21.200
Well, we'll have to see what happens, whether they actually deliver it.

26:21.200 --> 26:26.600
They made a lot of promises, or rather someone who worked for them made a lot of promises.

26:26.600 --> 26:29.040
And then he left for whatever reason.

26:29.040 --> 26:33.880
So we'll just have to see whether they can deliver on the promises that he made.

26:33.880 --> 26:37.400
But yeah, we'll watch this space and we might report back next week.

26:37.400 --> 26:38.960
We'll see what happens.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.080
But anyway, let's talk about Google I.O.

26:41.080 --> 26:43.980
We talked about it at the end of last week's show, I think.

26:43.980 --> 26:45.780
Now I've got a question for you.

26:45.780 --> 26:50.080
Was there anything that really stood out as interesting to you at Google I.O.?

26:50.080 --> 26:55.880
Besides Project Treble, which we already talked about, I would have to say that just Android

26:55.880 --> 26:59.840
O itself seems like it'll be a decent update for those of us that are using Android.

26:59.840 --> 27:03.940
I like notification dots that remind me of what I get on iOS.

27:03.940 --> 27:10.200
And I'm glad they're finally instituting iOS-like background limits, which will be pretty much,

27:10.200 --> 27:14.320
I think, in line with what much of us expect from our smartphone.

27:14.320 --> 27:18.160
And if you're not familiar, it just puts limits on background location and Wi-Fi scans and

27:18.160 --> 27:20.760
things like that that sometimes apps can go crazy with.

27:20.760 --> 27:21.760
What about you?

27:21.760 --> 27:25.080
Yeah, I mean, they call that vitals, don't they?

27:25.080 --> 27:28.200
Battery life and smoothness.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.680
And I think that that is very important.

27:30.680 --> 27:36.220
I mean, they basically have said that in Android O, there's going to be a few new features

27:36.220 --> 27:38.240
like the picture-in-picture and stuff.

27:38.240 --> 27:43.240
But generally speaking, most of the work that they're doing is on stability and kind of

27:43.240 --> 27:45.920
background plumbing, which is good to see.

27:45.920 --> 27:47.020
I agree.

27:47.020 --> 27:53.520
Did you see the stuff about Android Go, which seems to be like an effort to make Android

27:53.520 --> 27:55.960
more usable on lower-end devices?

27:55.960 --> 28:00.480
So devices that have one gig or less than memory, they're going to say that's going

28:00.480 --> 28:04.920
to be the Android Go experience, where they've optimized Android O to run smoothly on those

28:04.920 --> 28:05.920
devices.

28:05.920 --> 28:06.920
Yeah.

28:06.920 --> 28:09.120
It's such a brilliantly novel idea, isn't it?

28:09.120 --> 28:13.680
Like Android targeted at low-end phones for developing markets.

28:13.680 --> 28:16.680
You'd think that maybe they would have done this before at some point.

28:16.680 --> 28:17.680
Hmm.

28:17.680 --> 28:18.680
Hang on.

28:18.680 --> 28:19.680
Android One.

28:19.680 --> 28:20.680
Oh.

28:20.680 --> 28:21.680
Isn't that what that was?

28:21.680 --> 28:22.680
Yeah, that was my first thought, too.

28:22.680 --> 28:26.920
Although I do like this approach, so it's less of a let's break into emerging markets

28:26.920 --> 28:30.360
and more of a let's just target low-end devices.

28:30.360 --> 28:33.400
And by doing so, let's take a look at some of our apps.

28:33.400 --> 28:38.200
Let's make things like YouTube and Chrome use a little less memory, maybe use a little

28:38.200 --> 28:40.640
less storage space and mobile data.

28:40.640 --> 28:44.720
And that could affect and improve Android apps across the ecosystem.

28:44.720 --> 28:45.720
Oh, yeah.

28:45.720 --> 28:50.960
I mean, I think it's good news, generally, to slim down stuff and make it more efficient.

28:50.960 --> 28:51.960
But I mean, it is definitely...

28:51.960 --> 28:56.720
I mean, they talk about the building for billions program.

28:56.720 --> 28:59.640
So I mean, this is clearly aimed at the developing market.

28:59.640 --> 29:06.240
But they've maybe realized that it's not enough to just make Android, the operating system,

29:06.240 --> 29:07.240
work on low-end hardware.

29:07.240 --> 29:09.240
They need to make the applications as well.

29:09.240 --> 29:14.960
The thing about this is it could also lock in Android applications to being essentially

29:14.960 --> 29:22.160
low-quality, low-end, lowest common denominator applications, even less competitive with iOS.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.160
Maybe.

29:23.160 --> 29:27.840
But you think about it, if you've got super high-end hardware running software that's

29:27.840 --> 29:33.120
designed for lower-end hardware, it's going to run so smoothly that, okay, it might not

29:33.120 --> 29:37.080
have necessarily all the features of iOS.

29:37.080 --> 29:42.000
But if you've got a really smooth experience, and I mean, look, let's face facts.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.000
You're using an iPhone.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.680
There's got to be a reason for that.

29:44.680 --> 29:46.720
I don't like Android.

29:46.720 --> 29:52.800
I think Android is basically unstable, crashy, and slow and shit.

29:52.800 --> 29:57.920
But at the same time, I like the fact that I can configure it and customize it how I

29:57.920 --> 30:03.120
want and the fact that it is a little bit more open than iOS, and also it's a lot cheaper

30:03.120 --> 30:04.240
as well.

30:04.240 --> 30:11.800
But there is this chasm between iOS and Android, as far as I can see, in terms of the user

30:11.800 --> 30:12.800
experience.

30:12.800 --> 30:19.680
Again, that is similar to the chasm between Mac OS and other operating systems.

30:19.680 --> 30:22.520
It's to do with controlling the hardware as well as the software.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.280
You're going to have a better experience.

30:24.280 --> 30:29.600
But generally speaking, the way Android is written and just put together is just terrible

30:29.600 --> 30:30.680
as far as I can see.

30:30.680 --> 30:31.680
Yeah.

30:31.680 --> 30:32.880
And Samsung would seem to agree with you.

30:32.880 --> 30:33.880
Well, yeah.

30:33.880 --> 30:38.360
I mean, that's why they have been backing this Tizen horse for a long time now.

30:38.360 --> 30:39.360
It's been a very slow burn.

30:39.360 --> 30:44.800
There have only been four phones, I think, in total, one of which has been released recently.

30:44.800 --> 30:47.600
But it's kind of their backup plan, isn't it?

30:47.600 --> 30:53.480
And they have announced this week that they are looking to use Tizen in their IoT stuff

30:53.480 --> 30:54.920
rather than Android things.

30:54.920 --> 30:59.940
Well, I mean, they didn't overtly say rather than Android things, but that's what you've

30:59.940 --> 31:01.180
got to read into it.

31:01.180 --> 31:02.560
That would be the other option.

31:02.560 --> 31:05.720
And to my surprise, it's not straight up Tizen.

31:05.720 --> 31:10.320
It's Tizen RT, which would obviously stand for real time, like a more streamlined real

31:10.320 --> 31:11.760
time version of Tizen.

31:11.760 --> 31:12.760
Yeah.

31:12.760 --> 31:16.600
And they want to get it on all of their home appliances by 2020, which is not very long

31:16.600 --> 31:20.740
in terms of these industrial timescales, is it?

31:20.740 --> 31:24.840
And so you're going to have smart fridges, smart washing machines, all shit that I have

31:24.840 --> 31:29.040
no interest in personally, but I think people do.

31:29.040 --> 31:34.520
And instead of looking to Google, they're looking to do it in-house with Tizen.

31:34.520 --> 31:36.400
I don't think people have an interest yet.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.280
If they get it right, people would.

31:38.280 --> 31:44.240
If, for example, I could have a push notification go to my phone when my oven was done with

31:44.240 --> 31:48.240
something, I might potentially find that useful from time to time, but the implementation

31:48.240 --> 31:49.600
is going to really matter.

31:49.600 --> 31:54.960
And they say their goal, this was a report that was over at TizenExperts.com, and they

31:54.960 --> 31:58.160
were at an event where all of this was being discussed.

31:58.160 --> 32:02.680
And they were interviewing Samsung reps, and they say their goal is to have all home appliances

32:02.680 --> 32:08.840
smart to create devices that work in sync and communicate according to Samsung's Internet

32:08.840 --> 32:10.560
of Things agenda.

32:10.560 --> 32:16.040
That's scary sounding, isn't it?

32:16.040 --> 32:18.760
And the example they give sounds so horrible.

32:18.760 --> 32:23.840
Imagine you're in the middle of a riveting scene, and you get a pop-up notification on

32:23.840 --> 32:26.560
your TV that your laundry is done.

32:26.560 --> 32:29.800
That is not what I want, but that's what they're trying to build.

32:29.800 --> 32:33.680
Their agenda sounds like a threat, doesn't it, IoT agenda?

32:33.680 --> 32:34.680
Yeah.

32:34.680 --> 32:39.800
You know what else Samsung was bragging about, which I don't really know, because Tizen's

32:39.800 --> 32:43.120
adoption is not huge, but here's some perspective for you.

32:43.120 --> 32:48.380
They confirmed, this is from Samsung, that Tizen has surpassed BlackBerry OS in smartphone

32:48.380 --> 32:54.520
usage to become the fourth largest smartphone OS in two years, and Tizen has also surpassed

32:54.520 --> 33:00.200
Android Wear in market share to become the second most used wearable platform.

33:00.200 --> 33:08.920
But that says less about the success of Tizen on wearables than it does about the success

33:08.920 --> 33:12.400
or failure of Android Wear and wearables in general.

33:12.400 --> 33:16.200
I know that Apple are doing okay with their watch, but they're not doing as well as they

33:16.200 --> 33:17.440
hoped.

33:17.440 --> 33:23.920
And it seems like every week, or at least every few weeks, I'm seeing headlines about

33:23.920 --> 33:28.080
another manufacturer is stopping making smart watches because they're just not selling well

33:28.080 --> 33:29.080
enough.

33:29.080 --> 33:30.080
Yeah.

33:30.080 --> 33:31.080
I would say I agree.

33:31.080 --> 33:34.560
It does say more about how the wearable market's doing in general, and I think it also does

33:34.560 --> 33:39.220
say how the entire wearable market is doing versus the Apple Watch.

33:39.220 --> 33:42.680
The Apple Watch does seem to be selling, but I think you're probably right, Joe.

33:42.680 --> 33:46.400
I don't think it's probably selling as well as Apple wants, and there's been rumors recently

33:46.400 --> 33:52.120
about them adding glucose monitoring and all kinds of things, which I got to say, as somebody

33:52.120 --> 33:59.000
who has experimented with a couple of Pebbles, three Android Wear watches, couple of Apple

33:59.000 --> 34:00.000
Watches.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.560
Here at Jupiter Broadcasting, we kind of pass equipment around, so we all kind of like somebody

34:04.560 --> 34:08.600
gets it and we all kind of get to try it out for a little while, and for a good amount

34:08.600 --> 34:09.760
of time, six months or so.

34:09.760 --> 34:14.040
I have to say out of all of them, probably the health monitoring on the Apple Watch is

34:14.040 --> 34:15.320
pretty solid.

34:15.320 --> 34:18.400
They have some good stuff there, and Google Health has been getting better and better

34:18.400 --> 34:23.260
at Google Fit, I guess, but it really, if you're into that kind of stuff, so if you're

34:23.260 --> 34:27.440
somebody who goes for an evening walk, for example, and you want to see if you're progressively

34:27.440 --> 34:31.080
walking further or faster, it's nice for that kind of stuff.

34:31.080 --> 34:38.520
If you're somebody who is less inclined to get out, but if you can gamify it a little

34:38.520 --> 34:43.360
bit and there is a goal that you will complete, if you just go for a little bit further of

34:43.360 --> 34:49.200
a walk and it's just one more thing that inclines you to go, I find it useful for that kind

34:49.200 --> 34:50.200
of stuff.

34:50.200 --> 34:53.520
And whoever nails that the best, and it could be Fitbit for all I know, but whoever nails

34:53.520 --> 34:56.720
that the best will probably have the most successful wearable product.

34:56.720 --> 35:01.120
And until then, Tizen can sell hundreds of thousands, and Android Wear can sell hundreds

35:01.120 --> 35:03.800
of thousands, and Apple Watch will sell a few million, I think.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.400
Yeah, sounds about right.

35:05.400 --> 35:06.800
Now Joe, we have some good news.

35:06.800 --> 35:10.760
For those of you who like to consume this show in video, we have new video feeds that

35:10.760 --> 35:12.840
will be live as of this episode.

35:12.840 --> 35:16.440
They'll be embedded at the Jupiter Broadcasting website with each episode post, but you can

35:16.440 --> 35:20.760
also grab the feed at linuxactionnews.com slash video.

35:20.760 --> 35:24.720
Yeah, and there was kind of a mixed reaction to the video that you put together for the

35:24.720 --> 35:25.720
first episode, wasn't there?

35:25.720 --> 35:26.800
It was a bit psychedelic.

35:26.800 --> 35:27.800
I would say.

35:27.800 --> 35:28.960
Yeah, sorry about that.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.200
I quite liked it.

35:30.200 --> 35:33.280
I was trying to go for something new, as you know, because we were chatting about it.

35:33.280 --> 35:37.200
Yeah, I think it looked all right, but some people thought it was a bit headache-inducing,

35:37.200 --> 35:39.720
but hopefully this one will be better.

35:39.720 --> 35:43.760
Yeah, we'll make a few tweaks over the next couple of weeks, and don't forget, the audio

35:43.760 --> 35:49.360
feeds are always available, linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe, and you can tweet feedback

35:49.360 --> 35:51.480
or stories, twitter.com slash linuxactionnews.

35:51.480 --> 35:55.600
Yeah, and a quick plug for User Error, which has come back.

35:55.600 --> 35:57.680
Brand new episode just came out this week.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.040
I loved it.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.040
It was a lot of fun.

36:00.040 --> 36:03.880
We'll have some good Linux content in there, so go listen to User Error, and then after

36:03.880 --> 36:06.200
you're done, go check out Late Night Linux.

36:06.200 --> 36:12.880
Yeah, my other show, latenightlinux.com, with iKey from the Solus project, and a couple

36:12.880 --> 36:16.280
of other guys who are not going to get a mention.

36:16.280 --> 36:17.280
We love them, though.

36:17.280 --> 36:18.280
No, Phelan and Jesse.

36:18.280 --> 36:20.200
Yeah, it's a good group of guys.

36:20.200 --> 36:23.920
We have a good laugh on that show, so check it out, latenightlinux.com.

36:23.920 --> 36:27.620
Okay everyone, thank you for tuning into this week's episode of Linux Action News.

36:27.620 --> 36:30.880
We'll be back next Monday at linuxactionnews.com.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.840
I'm at Chris LAS.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.540
I'm at Joe Ressington.

36:34.540 --> 36:36.600
And we'll see you right back here next Monday.

36:36.600 --> 37:04.760
See you later.
