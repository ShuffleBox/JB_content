00:00.000 --> 00:16.680
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.680 --> 00:21.240
This is episode 38, recorded on January 28th, 2018.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.240
I'm Chris.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.240
And I'm Joe.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.240
Hello, Joe.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.440
It is good to be connected with you again.

00:25.440 --> 00:29.920
Hey, we get to start out this week talking about something that you and I chat about

00:29.920 --> 00:31.860
off air quite a bit.

00:31.860 --> 00:35.160
And that's the future of open source powered mobile devices.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.260
Yeah, and one of the great hopes for that is plasma mobile.

00:38.260 --> 00:43.480
And this week, we've had a blog post from one of the KDE community members about testing

00:43.480 --> 00:46.840
of ISOs for plasma mobile.

00:46.840 --> 00:55.700
And they are x86 ISOs, which you can run on either KVM or QEMU or VirtualBox or as I did

00:55.700 --> 00:58.160
on an actual bit of hardware.

00:58.160 --> 01:00.160
And I've got the perfect device for this.

01:00.160 --> 01:06.480
It's a little 11 inch Asus Vivobook, which is touchscreen, but with the keyboard, obviously.

01:06.480 --> 01:09.940
And I tried it out, and I was really impressed with it.

01:09.940 --> 01:14.100
This is some action they're taking after they conducted a survey to see how users might

01:14.100 --> 01:17.120
be able to best contribute back to plasma mobile.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.980
And it was, let us test it.

01:18.980 --> 01:23.400
And so they've put some effort into making it, like Joe said, testable on multiple different

01:23.400 --> 01:26.160
virtualization platforms and on real hardware.

01:26.160 --> 01:29.980
I gave it a go in VMware Workstation, and it doesn't work.

01:29.980 --> 01:33.880
So that's one of the virtualization platforms you might skip right over.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.600
So I'm pretty curious about your experience, Joe.

01:36.600 --> 01:40.120
Well, it boots saying that it's KDE neon.

01:40.120 --> 01:45.000
And the thing is that because it's got the Linux kernel, and it's got all of the standard

01:45.000 --> 01:50.280
desktop Linux hardware acceleration drivers and all that kind of thing, it means that

01:50.280 --> 01:55.960
you don't have any of the lag that you have with ropey driver integration on mobile devices.

01:55.960 --> 01:59.600
And of course, you've got the power of the i3 processor as well.

01:59.600 --> 02:05.640
So it was very smooth, and everything pretty much worked.

02:05.640 --> 02:08.280
It's not really a desktop operating system, obviously.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.880
So it's not the kind of thing that you're going to install and keep.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.800
I just run it live off the USB stick.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.080
But everything just seemed to be working well.

02:16.080 --> 02:19.680
And I was quite surprised because the last time I tried it out on a mobile device, it

02:19.680 --> 02:23.680
was kind of working and not really that well.

02:23.680 --> 02:26.120
And yeah, this has got a lot of rough edges.

02:26.120 --> 02:30.280
As they say, it's alpha quality.

02:30.280 --> 02:33.840
And I think that it is kind of decent alpha quality.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.280
Did you find the text readable and all of the touch targets tappable?

02:37.280 --> 02:40.400
Yeah, all that stuff worked perfectly.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.080
That is pretty impressive for an alpha.

02:42.080 --> 02:45.920
The other thing that strikes me is they are coming to the people a bit.

02:45.920 --> 02:51.000
So they've created a plasma mobile matrix room that folks can give feedback.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.200
And they also have a plasma mobile telegram group, which people that are on mobile may

02:55.200 --> 02:58.060
be very likely to join to give them feedback.

02:58.060 --> 03:02.000
And then they have the traditional mailing lists and IRC rooms that an open source project

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
tends to have.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.840
What I really like the best about this is the humble, modest attitude that they have.

03:07.840 --> 03:11.160
They're not coming out saying this is the most amazing thing ever.

03:11.160 --> 03:14.040
They're coming out and saying, we need people to test it.

03:14.040 --> 03:15.220
We're working on this.

03:15.220 --> 03:16.220
It's work in progress.

03:16.220 --> 03:18.200
It's alpha quality.

03:18.200 --> 03:22.240
And that makes me much more forgiving towards it.

03:22.240 --> 03:26.240
If they tried to say it was a finished product, then I'd be pretty down on it.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.080
But it's not a finished product.

03:28.080 --> 03:33.080
They want the community to get involved with testing and making it better.

03:33.080 --> 03:40.800
And I really do feel that it is the best hope for an interface at least in terms of a mobile

03:40.800 --> 03:43.720
operating system that's based on Linux.

03:43.720 --> 03:49.400
It also strikes me that this effort isn't tied to a particular hardware initiative,

03:49.400 --> 03:54.540
which if you look back at previous attempts, it's almost always tied to a specific hardware's

03:54.540 --> 03:55.960
success or failure.

03:55.960 --> 04:01.040
And when that hardware succeeds or likely fails, then the contributions to the mobile

04:01.040 --> 04:05.240
operating system cease, even when it's just contributions back upstream.

04:05.240 --> 04:11.160
Whereas this is a general mobile touch platform that is hardware agnostic, it just takes advantage

04:11.160 --> 04:12.920
of the Linux underpinnings.

04:12.920 --> 04:18.680
And so it could just continue on at a slow but steady and humble pace for years until

04:18.680 --> 04:20.840
the right device comes along to run it.

04:20.840 --> 04:26.520
Well, that right device may well be sooner than we think if Purism actually deliver on

04:26.520 --> 04:27.520
their promises.

04:27.520 --> 04:28.520
Yeah.

04:28.520 --> 04:33.760
After a couple of months, we have some news about what's going on with the Librem 5 phone.

04:33.760 --> 04:36.480
Purism has posted a Librem 5 phone progress report.

04:36.480 --> 04:40.880
And it mostly focuses around the design team and what they're working on about putting

04:40.880 --> 04:46.200
that team together and creating a unified look for PureOS devices.

04:46.200 --> 04:49.920
And there's hints of something I've heard of before in here, Joe, something familiar.

04:49.920 --> 04:50.920
Yeah.

04:50.920 --> 04:51.920
Convergence.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.160
We've heard that word before, haven't we?

04:54.160 --> 04:58.160
Realistically, Joe, laptops, tablets, phones, it's not enough.

04:58.160 --> 05:01.240
Using GTK, Qt, not enough.

05:01.240 --> 05:04.680
Also need to have our own operating system and then, of course, make it converge.

05:04.680 --> 05:09.720
Yeah, but convergence is one of those words that doesn't really mean anything or it can

05:09.720 --> 05:11.320
mean so many different things.

05:11.320 --> 05:17.340
And I think that in the case of Purism, what they mean by it is more a case of a consistent

05:17.340 --> 05:23.440
look and feel rather than devices that will act as a mobile device or a proper computer.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.160
Ah, we need a new term then.

05:25.160 --> 05:29.080
Well, whatever you want to call it, the fact is you're going to need to have GNOME running

05:29.080 --> 05:34.600
on the mobile device and the desktop PureOS.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.280
Otherwise you're not going to have a consistent experience.

05:37.280 --> 05:41.820
And that's what's confusing about this because they're very enthusiastic about Plasma Mobile,

05:41.820 --> 05:43.320
as am I.

05:43.320 --> 05:48.480
And even say in this blog post that GNOME is less advanced when it comes to mobile.

05:48.480 --> 05:54.920
And yet they're having to keep both options open because of this convergence thing.

05:54.920 --> 06:00.920
And maybe the best strategy would just be to say, we'll have GNOME over here for the

06:00.920 --> 06:06.760
desktop operating system and we'll have Plasma Mobile for the Librem 5.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.440
That seems like the smart approach.

06:08.440 --> 06:12.560
For resource reasons, if nothing else, I don't know how many times as a community we're going

06:12.560 --> 06:17.040
to watch open source companies go down this path where they think that they can build

06:17.040 --> 06:21.720
the one true operating system that will work across all the devices that developers will

06:21.720 --> 06:23.520
want to run to.

06:23.520 --> 06:30.720
And meanwhile, larger companies in this space, Dell, Dell, they are succeeding because they're

06:30.720 --> 06:35.640
shipping vanilla Ubuntu strapped onto their hardware.

06:35.640 --> 06:40.640
And they're trying to innovate at the hardware level and they're seeing a huge growth in

06:40.640 --> 06:43.360
the Sputnik product line because of that strategy.

06:43.360 --> 06:48.040
And it just seems on the other opposite end of the spectrum in an attempt to differentiate,

06:48.040 --> 06:51.540
smaller OEMs are trying to build their own operating systems.

06:51.540 --> 06:56.480
But their customer base, Linux users, are smart enough to sit back and go, that's not

06:56.480 --> 06:57.480
sustainable.

06:57.480 --> 07:00.240
That's not even something that is in demand.

07:00.240 --> 07:04.820
So their own customer base is hip to what they're trying to do and it never succeeds.

07:04.820 --> 07:09.040
And instead you have companies, which Purism seems to be on the path to becoming one of

07:09.040 --> 07:15.760
these, unfortunately, that split their attention and they become a jack of all, master of none.

07:15.760 --> 07:22.300
When you read this update, it is clear that they should be all in on KDE's Plasma Mobile.

07:22.300 --> 07:23.300
It's clear.

07:23.300 --> 07:24.300
They praise it.

07:24.300 --> 07:28.800
They have a line in here where they say Purism's contribution to KDE may be generally focused

07:28.800 --> 07:33.400
on hardware integration and testing rather than design because it's good to go.

07:33.400 --> 07:36.760
They think it's just pretty much there, they're blown away by it.

07:36.760 --> 07:40.640
Then they talk about how Gnome is just this big pile of hurt that they're going to have

07:40.640 --> 07:43.880
to submit a bunch of patches upstream to make it work correctly.

07:43.880 --> 07:49.200
So that way the tiny user base that uses PureOS will be able to run the same crazy desktop

07:49.200 --> 07:53.400
GTK applications on their phone.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.920
How does this make sense to anybody that's organizing this project?

07:55.920 --> 07:59.120
Well, I think the tendency is to be quite insular, isn't it?

07:59.120 --> 08:04.720
And to think that just because you and all your team are using PureOS, you want to have

08:04.720 --> 08:08.880
this convergence and you're kind of assuming that every laptop that you're selling with

08:08.880 --> 08:11.360
PureOS is having it kept on there.

08:11.360 --> 08:16.320
When in reality, I would have thought that most of the kind of people who want to buy

08:16.320 --> 08:22.520
a Linux laptop, they have their own preferences about what Linux they want to use and what

08:22.520 --> 08:24.080
desktop environment and all the rest of it.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.600
So they want to customize it.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.160
And so I'd be very surprised.

08:27.160 --> 08:33.120
Well, I would like to learn the reality of people who have bought a Purism laptop.

08:33.120 --> 08:37.940
Have you kept PureOS on there or have you installed Arch or Ubuntu or Fedora or whatever

08:37.940 --> 08:39.680
it is that you normally use?

08:39.680 --> 08:42.520
Let us know at LinuxActionNews on the Twitter.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.440
I would be curious too or at LinuxActionNews.com slash contact.

08:46.440 --> 08:47.820
That is a good data point to collect in.

08:47.820 --> 08:52.080
But in the meantime, if I could be hired as a consultant for a moment, I would advise

08:52.080 --> 08:53.080
this.

08:53.080 --> 08:56.020
If you want to differentiate, if you want to go all in on something, differentiate by

08:56.020 --> 08:57.520
shipping plasma.

08:57.520 --> 09:01.680
Be the one vendor in this marketplace that's really killing it with plasma.

09:01.680 --> 09:06.000
And if you want convergence, start with the mobile device, nail the mobile experience.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.240
You will have more customers there than you've ever had with the laptops.

09:09.240 --> 09:13.120
And then you'll have demand to make plasma work on your laptops.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.200
And that's where the conversions can happen.

09:15.200 --> 09:20.680
And QML and Qt and the plasma desktop are all perfectly positioned to enable you to

09:20.680 --> 09:21.680
do this.

09:21.680 --> 09:26.240
You don't really end up differentiating yourself in the Linux market by shipping yet another

09:26.240 --> 09:27.240
GTK desktop.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.160
That's kind of boring at this point.

09:29.160 --> 09:32.040
You want to stand out to Linux users and ship something different?

09:32.040 --> 09:33.040
Build it on plasma.

09:33.040 --> 09:37.440
Ironically, he says, as he's switching back to the GNOME 3 desktop this week.

09:37.440 --> 09:38.640
Yeah.

09:38.640 --> 09:45.720
Well, another company that has heavily relied upon crowdfunding is Mycroft.

09:45.720 --> 09:50.280
And this week, the Kickstarter went live for Mycroft Mark 2.

09:50.280 --> 09:54.740
And already it has smashed through its goal within a matter of hours.

09:54.740 --> 09:58.200
So this is definitely happening.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.640
And they've made a lot of promises here.

10:01.640 --> 10:06.120
They've said that they accept that last time they made some mistakes and they've learned

10:06.120 --> 10:08.260
from that.

10:08.260 --> 10:15.640
And $129, it's quite expensive for a voice assistant, although one with a screen, it's

10:15.640 --> 10:17.800
not too bad.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.200
But they are not messing around anymore.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.920
They're not pitching this as a development device.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.100
They're saying this is consumer ready.

10:25.100 --> 10:28.720
They are making massive, massive promises here.

10:28.720 --> 10:33.760
And as much as I really want them to deliver on those, I am somewhat skeptical to say the

10:33.760 --> 10:34.760
least, I'm afraid.

10:34.760 --> 10:39.520
Yeah, they really do double down on the beam forming microphones that take six microphone

10:39.520 --> 10:44.100
inputs, locate the person speaking, and then hone in on them.

10:44.100 --> 10:48.520
They talk about the two 10 watt speakers that are in this thing.

10:48.520 --> 10:52.920
And they talk in here about how they worked with one of their partners to build in acoustic

10:52.920 --> 10:59.520
echo cancellation, noise reduction, and other technologies to help Mycroft hear you while

10:59.520 --> 11:01.580
it's really blaring loud sounds.

11:01.580 --> 11:06.320
This is, in my opinion, what the Amazon show could have been.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.120
This is what Amazon should have built.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.920
I can see why it's doing well.

11:09.920 --> 11:16.520
It's promising room filling sound, open source backed software, and a new screen interface

11:16.520 --> 11:18.400
that looks pretty good.

11:18.400 --> 11:23.000
Yeah, and integrating with what Mozilla has been doing with Project Common Voice, so they're

11:23.000 --> 11:26.120
no longer having to rely on proprietary backends.

11:26.120 --> 11:34.080
It all on paper sounds amazing, but the question that is on my lips is what are beans?

11:34.080 --> 11:39.520
We've seen that video that Popey made of the Mark One, and it was terrible.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.040
And that was the software's fault.

11:41.040 --> 11:46.900
And okay, it's come along a little way since then, but realistically, how much cash are

11:46.900 --> 11:52.120
they going to need to have injected from this Kickstarter to bring that software up to a

11:52.120 --> 11:58.020
standard where it can compete with the Amazon one and the Google one and the Apple one?

11:58.020 --> 12:00.800
It just seems farfetched to me.

12:00.800 --> 12:07.140
As my primary concern as well is the one question they're not really answering in their previous

12:07.140 --> 12:12.440
blog posts and in this Kickstarter post is what is significantly different about this

12:12.440 --> 12:15.200
unit that will improve the software situation?

12:15.200 --> 12:19.720
Because if it was simply just hardware resources, then putting the Microsoft software on a faster

12:19.720 --> 12:24.160
Raspberry Pi would have made it better, and we all know that's clearly not the case.

12:24.160 --> 12:27.520
So significantly, what's changed about the software?

12:27.520 --> 12:29.520
In the video, the voice sounds different.

12:29.520 --> 12:32.320
It sounds a little newer as well.

12:32.320 --> 12:36.800
And they're using language that is somewhat disingenuous, and so that is a bit of a red

12:36.800 --> 12:38.320
flag on a Kickstarter for me.

12:38.320 --> 12:39.800
I'll give you an example.

12:39.800 --> 12:44.660
AI and voice technology are too important to our collective future to remain the property

12:44.660 --> 12:47.000
of the Silicon Valley giants.

12:47.000 --> 12:55.160
The mark two by Mycroft is the device challenging them, which that's a pretty big exaggeration

12:55.160 --> 12:56.380
to begin with right there.

12:56.380 --> 12:57.800
That's a lot to swallow.

12:57.800 --> 13:01.980
But then later on, they lean into how the community is building this device and how

13:01.980 --> 13:03.880
it's open source.

13:03.880 --> 13:10.080
A key differentiator, they say, is that Mycroft's skill list is infinitely growing thanks to

13:10.080 --> 13:12.260
our robust developer community.

13:12.260 --> 13:17.320
They're building skills that serve everyone's needs, not just for the corporations behind

13:17.320 --> 13:18.320
them.

13:18.320 --> 13:22.620
In addition to standard skills like weather updates and timers, you'll find these ones.

13:22.620 --> 13:28.600
And then they list skills that are backed by corporations like Philip Hughes, YouTube,

13:28.600 --> 13:34.800
Pandora, NPR, Roku, Facebook, Wolfram Alpha.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.280
You get the picture.

13:36.280 --> 13:41.140
Their front and center skills are, quote, for the corporations behind them.

13:41.140 --> 13:44.180
And so they say they have an infinite list of skills.

13:44.180 --> 13:51.240
From what I could tell, there is 31, 32 official skills that are created by Mycroft now.

13:51.240 --> 13:55.860
There are 16 community skills that are considered functioning, 16.

13:55.860 --> 14:01.860
As of January 28, Amazon's voice assistant, the Echo, has 24,000 skills.

14:01.860 --> 14:07.620
And if you look at just the skills that are rated four stars and above, there are 5,201

14:07.620 --> 14:09.720
of them.

14:09.720 --> 14:15.160
Compare that to Google Assistant, which has 1,800 different actions available right now.

14:15.160 --> 14:19.560
So when they're using language that this is the device to challenge the Echo or the Google

14:19.560 --> 14:25.220
Assistant, and that they have an infinite list of skills, that's a lot of exaggeration

14:25.220 --> 14:26.220
for me to swallow.

14:26.220 --> 14:28.300
It sounds like they're selling a little too hard.

14:28.300 --> 14:31.380
Well, yeah, they are definitely exaggerating.

14:31.380 --> 14:35.340
And you kind of have to do that for PR, don't you, if you want to sell the units and get

14:35.340 --> 14:38.620
the money in and then hire the developers?

14:38.620 --> 14:44.180
I just really want to give this the benefit of the doubt because they did make some mistakes

14:44.180 --> 14:48.600
and they have said that they've learned from them, from the manufacturing to the logistics

14:48.600 --> 14:51.480
of actually sending them out and all of that stuff.

14:51.480 --> 14:54.980
It sounds like it's going to be good.

14:54.980 --> 14:59.620
And the mock-up, the voice was working really well, it answered really quickly.

14:59.620 --> 15:05.780
If they can actually deliver that, then I think the skills list will grow very quickly.

15:05.780 --> 15:10.580
And okay, they've exaggerated for now, but we need something like this.

15:10.580 --> 15:16.140
I personally don't, but there are so many people who use these voice assistants.

15:16.140 --> 15:20.580
It's a growing market and we need to have something good and an open source.

15:20.580 --> 15:25.620
The problem I have with that analysis is you could say those same exact words for the first

15:25.620 --> 15:27.660
Kickstarter they did.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.080
Nothing's changed in that regard.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.220
They're still exaggerating.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.900
This is still something we need.

15:31.900 --> 15:36.980
It's like they play to our emotional open source Linux user buttons here.

15:36.980 --> 15:41.200
It's the same reason why convergence devices are getting funded.

15:41.200 --> 15:46.500
There is a certain category of dream device that us geeks have and we're willing to fund

15:46.500 --> 15:47.500
it.

15:47.500 --> 15:51.420
But don't you think that they are best placed with all the experience that they've got with

15:51.420 --> 15:57.740
the mark one and now going forward with this mark two, they are surely in the best position

15:57.740 --> 16:02.980
to have some sort of open source alternative to Amazon and Google and Apple.

16:02.980 --> 16:03.980
Hmm.

16:03.980 --> 16:04.980
Maybe.

16:04.980 --> 16:09.980
Maybe that's sort of like saying that open BSD is an alternative to Windows and Mac OS.

16:09.980 --> 16:14.420
The reality is, is that the third player in the market is either going to be Microsoft

16:14.420 --> 16:17.260
with Cortana or Apple with the HomePod.

16:17.260 --> 16:23.140
And the first player is so far ahead right now, Amazon, and Google had a huge, they just

16:23.140 --> 16:24.460
released numbers.

16:24.460 --> 16:29.500
Three percent of assistance sold over the holiday season were Google assistant devices.

16:29.500 --> 16:36.460
So Google seeing a huge growth in their assistant, a distant third is going to be HomePod or Cortana.

16:36.460 --> 16:42.100
And then maybe far off in the distance, there's a, there's a great spot for Mycroft.

16:42.100 --> 16:46.040
I hate that you're right, but I just, I can't argue with you anymore.

16:46.040 --> 16:49.620
If they could answer a few fundamental questions, what's significantly different about this

16:49.620 --> 16:52.900
software stack that's going to make it better?

16:52.900 --> 16:57.420
I would love to know more about what drives that screen and how that's created.

16:57.420 --> 17:00.940
If they had more to offer when it came to software that was a companion that would run

17:00.940 --> 17:04.920
on the desktop and an app that would run on the phone, and so I could have one centralized

17:04.920 --> 17:10.260
Mycroft server, these would be pretty significant differences that might appeal to businesses

17:10.260 --> 17:13.380
or small groups of people or open source projects.

17:13.380 --> 17:17.660
But as it stands right now, I'm not seeing the market appeal.

17:17.660 --> 17:26.020
I wish the open source private argument was a winner in this category, but the market

17:26.020 --> 17:31.940
has so clearly demonstrated that they're willing to put these units from Google in their house.

17:31.940 --> 17:37.380
Privacy is on the total end of the requirement spectrum and they're going at this all in

17:37.380 --> 17:42.340
positioning this as privacy respecting because it's open source, community powered because

17:42.340 --> 17:47.020
it's open source, but the market doesn't give any consideration to that when they're buying

17:47.020 --> 17:49.260
these lady tubes.

17:49.260 --> 17:52.020
I think you're right, but I think that there is a potential market for this.

17:52.020 --> 17:57.500
I don't think that it's going to be anywhere near the market for the Amazon and Google

17:57.500 --> 18:03.860
ones, but I think that there are enough people who care about this stuff within our community

18:03.860 --> 18:10.060
to make it a viable business as long as it's good enough because there's people like you

18:10.060 --> 18:14.620
who want to control your lights and I heard you talking about wanting to turn your heater

18:14.620 --> 18:17.140
on from a bed and all that kind of stuff.

18:17.140 --> 18:21.560
So there is a market for it, but they have to deliver on their promises.

18:21.560 --> 18:29.260
If they don't deliver on their promises this time, then that's it, it's finished.

18:29.260 --> 18:34.420
Last.ting.com, go there to support this show and get $25 in service credit if you bring

18:34.420 --> 18:38.660
a device and if you don't have one or you're ready for something new, they'll give you

18:38.660 --> 18:40.780
$25 off a device.

18:40.780 --> 18:41.780
Think of that in a moment.

18:41.780 --> 18:42.780
I'll tell you more about that.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.900
But first let me just sort of set up the ground rules here.

18:44.900 --> 18:46.580
Ting is just simple mobile.

18:46.580 --> 18:49.600
It's $6 for the line and then you just pay for what you use.

18:49.600 --> 18:53.460
And here in the States they have CDMA and GSM networks, so you just pick whichever one

18:53.460 --> 18:59.760
is superior in your location, nationwide coverage, no contracts, pay for what you use.

18:59.760 --> 19:03.140
Your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

19:03.140 --> 19:06.140
Whatever you use, that's what you pay, plus Uncle Sam's cut.

19:06.140 --> 19:10.940
For me, it's so handy to have a MiFi that I turn on and off from time to time when I'm

19:10.940 --> 19:11.940
traveling.

19:11.940 --> 19:13.540
It's also very simple to do that with Ting.

19:13.540 --> 19:17.500
They have a great control panel and I can go in there and see how much the MiFi is using,

19:17.500 --> 19:18.580
see if I'm comfortable with that.

19:18.580 --> 19:20.180
I can set usage alerts.

19:20.180 --> 19:21.860
It's super good functionality.

19:21.860 --> 19:24.540
But remember I was telling you about $25 off a device?

19:24.540 --> 19:29.060
Well on Ting's blog right now, do me a favor, start by going to last.ting.com so that way

19:29.060 --> 19:31.520
they know we sent you there.

19:31.520 --> 19:36.900
Over on Ting's blog they have Hack Your Phone Plan, a smart phone plan for under $20.

19:36.900 --> 19:39.860
It's essentially $16 a month plus the taxes.

19:39.860 --> 19:42.620
So it works out to be around $20.

19:42.620 --> 19:43.620
It's not a pipe dream.

19:43.620 --> 19:46.420
It's something that they have a blog post about right now and you can learn more about

19:46.420 --> 19:47.420
it.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.420
Start by going to last.ting.com.

19:48.420 --> 19:58.380
Okay, so it's only a few months until we get Ubuntu 18.04, the LTS, and this week Will

19:58.380 --> 20:03.660
Cook has announced that that is going to default to Xorg.

20:03.660 --> 20:06.980
It's not going to default to Wayland like 17.10 did.

20:06.980 --> 20:12.340
Wayland will be available as a session, but the headline here is that they're going back

20:12.340 --> 20:18.220
to Xorg for the LTS which is going to be used for five years, which you cannot argue with

20:18.220 --> 20:19.660
the logic of it I don't think.

20:19.660 --> 20:23.540
Right, they released 17.10 in October of 2017.

20:23.540 --> 20:28.500
They shipped it with Wayland by default and they've been collecting usage information,

20:28.500 --> 20:33.300
bug reports, and they said they've just simply decided to ship Xorg by default now since

20:33.300 --> 20:34.660
this is an LTS.

20:34.660 --> 20:38.740
Unlike JOSET, Wayland is still installed, but they broke it down to three main reasons

20:38.740 --> 20:41.620
why Xorg is going to be the default in that dropdown.

20:41.620 --> 20:46.940
Number one, again, LTS releases, typically a larger percentage of businesses use these.

20:46.940 --> 20:53.540
Screen sharing in software like web RTC services, Google Hangouts, Skype, anything where you

20:53.540 --> 20:57.400
have a button to share your screen, that's not working under Wayland yet.

20:57.400 --> 21:02.460
It may still be a ways off and that's a big feature that corporate desktops use.

21:02.460 --> 21:07.820
But desktop control like RDP and VNC, they don't really work so well.

21:07.820 --> 21:09.620
They do work under Xorg though.

21:09.620 --> 21:14.940
And then number three, which is actually the number one issue that affects me, under Xorg

21:14.940 --> 21:20.580
when the Gnome shell crashes, it just reloads because Xorg is still running.

21:20.580 --> 21:24.240
But under Wayland, Gnome shell is the compositor.

21:24.240 --> 21:29.620
It is doing all of the heavy lifting and if it crashes, your entire graphical session's

21:29.620 --> 21:30.620
gone.

21:30.620 --> 21:33.540
It's a pretty damning indictment of Gnome, isn't it, that you have to have a different

21:33.540 --> 21:36.660
display server because it crashes so often.

21:36.660 --> 21:40.680
They must have had to tiptoe around this issue pretty carefully with their new re-established

21:40.680 --> 21:45.820
relationship with Gnome because they write in the post, the point about when things go

21:45.820 --> 21:51.220
wrong with Gnome is an architecture issue of Gnome shell and mutter and the only way

21:51.220 --> 21:57.620
to fix it is a massive architecture change or using Xorg.

21:57.620 --> 22:03.620
Which, as I said, is a damning indictment and one of the many reasons I use XFCE, I'm

22:03.620 --> 22:04.620
afraid.

22:04.620 --> 22:08.580
Yeah, although Gnome Shell 4 may address this issue, there's currently discussions in place

22:08.580 --> 22:13.740
to re-architect Gnome so that it's more modular, but if they did that, it would break extensions

22:13.740 --> 22:14.740
horribly.

22:14.740 --> 22:19.700
Yeah, but the thing is that Wayland is the future and we need to start moving over to

22:19.700 --> 22:25.900
it and we need to start testing it properly, but a five-year LTS for Ubuntu, I don't think

22:25.900 --> 22:27.940
is the right place to do that.

22:27.940 --> 22:35.100
They tried with 17.10 and they will almost certainly go back in 18.10, but the LTS, you

22:35.100 --> 22:43.260
need it to work absolutely solidly and okay, Xorg is old and you've got these security

22:43.260 --> 22:49.780
problems and all sorts of issues, but it's been working for the last 20-odd years and

22:49.780 --> 22:54.980
it's been working for the entire history of Ubuntu, so give it another two years and hopefully

22:54.980 --> 22:59.100
at that point it will be solid enough, but I think you have to admire the fact that they

22:59.100 --> 23:05.340
just are willing to accept this and say, no, it's not ready for the LTS and we're not going

23:05.340 --> 23:08.760
to have this new flashy thing, we're going to stick with the old thing because we know

23:08.760 --> 23:10.100
it works solidly.

23:10.100 --> 23:14.340
And you know they tried it and it's data-driven, they gave it a go in 17.10 which was the logical

23:14.340 --> 23:19.140
place to try it, and at the end of the day, if you still want to be a Wayland warrior,

23:19.140 --> 23:23.540
you can drop that box down, choose Wayland and submit bug reports all day long.

23:23.540 --> 23:28.820
Yeah, or just enjoy no screen tearing or all the other benefits if your hardware and software

23:28.820 --> 23:30.620
setup supports it.

23:30.620 --> 23:35.020
So yeah, it's kind of the best of both worlds and we're only talking about a default, which

23:35.020 --> 23:38.940
is what most people would use, but anyone who wants to use Wayland, at least it's in

23:38.940 --> 23:40.980
there to use if you want.

23:40.980 --> 23:42.420
Now here's a question for you, Joe.

23:42.420 --> 23:48.460
What do you think is going to resolve first, fully fixed from Spectre and Meltdown or Wayland

23:48.460 --> 23:51.180
shipping default on most Linux desktops?

23:51.180 --> 23:53.260
That is a very tricky question.

23:53.260 --> 23:59.740
Meltdown I think is easier, but Spectre, that could be five years maybe before that's properly

23:59.740 --> 24:05.540
sorted out, or even longer really because we need new hardware, don't we, by the looks

24:05.540 --> 24:06.540
of things.

24:06.540 --> 24:10.820
Well, perhaps the middle finger of Mr. Linus Torvalds can help speed things along.

24:10.820 --> 24:16.100
He was in the news again this week for telling Intel how he feels about their current approach

24:16.100 --> 24:17.100
to fixing all of this.

24:17.100 --> 24:18.860
Yeah, he's not happy, is he?

24:18.860 --> 24:19.860
To say the least.

24:19.860 --> 24:26.100
No, he's essentially calling Intel out for shipping mitigation as a feature that you

24:26.100 --> 24:31.100
can turn on or off, and he suspects that most people will leave it off for the performance

24:31.100 --> 24:35.380
improvements of it, and he thinks it's utter garbage that they're doing this.

24:35.380 --> 24:40.540
The patch quality, the code quality says are awful, and Intel's management must be insane

24:40.540 --> 24:44.860
if they think they can turn this thing around into a feature of future processors for the

24:44.860 --> 24:45.860
next few years.

24:45.860 --> 24:50.660
Yeah, and he even goes so far as to speculate that they're doing it this way because they

24:50.660 --> 24:54.260
don't want to have to recall millions of processors.

24:54.260 --> 24:58.660
This is a pretty big statement to make against Intel because they must have a pretty close

24:58.660 --> 25:02.000
working relationship with the Linux kernel development team.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.700
There's a lot of code in the Linux kernel for Intel processors, plus their networking

25:06.700 --> 25:10.300
stack, their graphics stacks, all the controllers that Intel makes.

25:10.300 --> 25:14.240
It's a pretty key relationship, and I wasn't really sure how Intel was going to respond

25:14.240 --> 25:18.620
to this because they're essentially calling them out on a lot of different issues from

25:18.620 --> 25:23.260
trying to deceive consumers, not fixing this thing for years, and like Joe said, trying

25:23.260 --> 25:24.580
to avoid a recall.

25:24.580 --> 25:26.100
That's inflammatory stuff.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.300
Was Intel going to sue?

25:27.300 --> 25:29.900
Was Intel going to release some sort of statement?

25:29.900 --> 25:32.500
And they seem to have released a response at least.

25:32.500 --> 25:36.660
They wrote a response to the register saying that they take the feedback of industry partners

25:36.660 --> 25:42.660
seriously, and they are actively engaging with the Linux community, including Linus,

25:42.660 --> 25:45.820
as they seek to work together on a solution.

25:45.820 --> 25:47.980
Reed, we're lowering up.

25:47.980 --> 25:50.340
No, I don't know.

25:50.340 --> 25:53.260
They've got to be pretty scared, haven't they, Intel, at this point, because there are a

25:53.260 --> 25:59.460
lot of lawsuits, class action lawsuits and stuff that are brewing, and this could maybe

25:59.460 --> 26:01.100
possibly take them down.

26:01.100 --> 26:03.500
Jesus, AMD sending you a check now?

26:03.500 --> 26:12.300
Well, I mean, I've been saying it for a while that Intel need to get on this arm train because

26:12.300 --> 26:16.100
otherwise the arm in the server room is going to eat their lunch.

26:16.100 --> 26:21.380
And it's not going to happen for a while, but combine it with this, and okay, I'm not

26:21.380 --> 26:27.380
saying that this year they're going to go bust, but you can see a sort of fairly steady

26:27.380 --> 26:34.020
decline if they don't step up, and I think they just ought to start manufacturing arm

26:34.020 --> 26:36.660
processors, licensing those and making them.

26:36.660 --> 26:43.260
That would be a good revenue stream for them, and make some x86 processors that don't have

26:43.260 --> 26:44.500
these vulnerabilities in them.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.780
Yeah, you might be onto something.

26:45.780 --> 26:49.080
I mean, they have sort of missed the boat on mobile, and they can't really pull the

26:49.080 --> 26:53.620
trigger on graphics to the point where they're even now working with AMD to ship AMD graphics

26:53.620 --> 26:55.460
with Intel CPUs.

26:55.460 --> 26:58.580
It is sort of remarkable where they've gotten to the last thing they've really remained

26:58.580 --> 27:02.220
good at is desktop CPUs, and now we have this problem.

27:02.220 --> 27:07.860
And the other thing this is exposing is how slow Intel is to make changes.

27:07.860 --> 27:15.300
It's exposing this slow design and build process that has gotten murky over the years, and

27:15.300 --> 27:19.540
it's going to prevent them from responding to this issue for several years.

27:19.540 --> 27:21.820
Some people like Linus are speculating three years.

27:21.820 --> 27:26.860
Well, yeah, if you think about it, the time it takes to design and manufacture a CPU,

27:26.860 --> 27:31.300
they've probably got the next two or even three generations already designed and underway

27:31.300 --> 27:36.100
with all the testing and prototyping and all the rest of it, and so you can't really expect

27:36.100 --> 27:41.100
them to make major changes to them until, well, maybe they might scrap the third one

27:41.100 --> 27:45.300
out or something, but they have CPUs to ship.

27:45.300 --> 27:46.780
And you talked about desktop.

27:46.780 --> 27:52.600
Well, I think one of the major areas for them is Xeons, isn't it, for servers?

27:52.600 --> 27:57.820
And that is where I think they're in the most danger of being taken over by these ARM clusters.

27:57.820 --> 28:04.340
In the meantime, you can pry my six-core i7 CPU out of my cold, dead hands.

28:04.340 --> 28:06.300
It's a great desktop chip for me.

28:06.300 --> 28:07.300
Yeah, it is.

28:07.300 --> 28:13.440
Let's hope that they can find some way around these vulnerabilities and have it not impact

28:13.440 --> 28:15.240
performance too much.

28:15.240 --> 28:19.580
But one camp that didn't get any heads up about these vulnerabilities were the BSDs.

28:19.580 --> 28:21.380
Yeah, that's a bit embarrassing.

28:21.380 --> 28:26.060
It makes you wonder where do they rank, and CSO Magazine is picking up on this thread

28:26.060 --> 28:31.500
and having some fun with it and speculates that perhaps the BSDs are slowly dying, and

28:31.500 --> 28:34.340
it's just the BSD developers who don't realize it.

28:34.340 --> 28:38.540
Yeah, I had to put this in just to troll the BSD people.

28:38.540 --> 28:42.660
I think that it's quite speculative, isn't it?

28:42.660 --> 28:45.480
It's saying that there's not many developers.

28:45.480 --> 28:49.480
The reason that there's not many bugs found in the BSD kernels is that there just aren't

28:49.480 --> 28:56.900
many people looking, and that if you look at the number of developers, it is significantly

28:56.900 --> 29:03.020
lower than Linux, and that there's not many people using BSD in production.

29:03.020 --> 29:07.560
The odd one like Netflix, just small companies, I don't know.

29:07.560 --> 29:14.820
It seems a bit tabloidy, but I just thought it would be funny to troll the BSD people.

29:14.820 --> 29:21.180
I looked into it, and so the whole article really hinges around a talk that happened

29:21.180 --> 29:25.820
to the 34C3 conference in Germany at the end of December.

29:25.820 --> 29:32.020
The director of penetration testing at IO Active held this talk, and it was really more

29:32.020 --> 29:34.440
about promoting his company.

29:34.440 --> 29:38.740
The talk itself was a little already off the mark, and then this article is based on it,

29:38.740 --> 29:42.860
but this individual from IO Active who was giving the talk said that he looked around

29:42.860 --> 29:46.660
at the different BSD kernel vulnerability reports and saw how they compared to Linux, and he

29:46.660 --> 29:51.860
thought to himself, how come there's only a handful of BSD security kernel bugs released

29:51.860 --> 29:53.360
every year as an advisory?

29:53.360 --> 29:54.360
I'm going through the notes.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.360
I only see a couple a year.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.360
Can that be?

29:56.360 --> 30:00.660
Could it be their code is so good, or could it be because no one is looking?

30:00.660 --> 30:06.380
So he himself started digging into the code, and he found 115 kernel bugs across three

30:06.380 --> 30:13.460
BSDs, including 30 for free BSD, 25 for open BSD, and 60 for net BSD.

30:13.460 --> 30:15.680
He said many of these were low-hanging fruits.

30:15.680 --> 30:20.420
He told the different BSD projects, and they all responded pretty well.

30:20.420 --> 30:24.360
But his core argument was, well, look at all these that I just happened to find when I

30:24.360 --> 30:26.300
just casually looked.

30:26.300 --> 30:30.860
The BSDs responded with, none of these bugs really matter with the exception of a couple

30:30.860 --> 30:31.860
of them.

30:31.860 --> 30:36.180
They don't really have any actual way to exploit them, and we don't even consider these to

30:36.180 --> 30:38.100
be security issues.

30:38.100 --> 30:41.780
So I remember back in the day, you and Alan would talk quite a lot about Netflix's infrastructure

30:41.780 --> 30:47.220
and the boxes that they put in ISP data centers and stuff.

30:47.220 --> 30:52.260
Do you have a feeling for why Netflix went for BSD rather than Linux?

30:52.260 --> 30:57.520
Free BSD is famous for a smokin' fast network stack, and that wouldn't surprise me if that

30:57.520 --> 30:59.140
appealed to them particularly.

30:59.140 --> 31:03.460
But the thing is, there is also a ton of Linux at Netflix.

31:03.460 --> 31:09.260
And if you look at a lot of Netflix's open source projects, the majority of the code

31:09.260 --> 31:13.100
that they release is code that's meant to run on Linux.

31:13.100 --> 31:17.420
So I think there is a fair amount of free BSD in the storage infrastructure level, and

31:17.420 --> 31:22.220
in these boxes that they put out at the ISPs, which have cached versions of the most popular

31:22.220 --> 31:25.000
Netflix movies, those run BSD.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.700
But the backend stuff, the web servers, the databases, the algorithms that figure out

31:29.700 --> 31:31.860
what you like, that's Linux.

31:31.860 --> 31:37.100
I didn't know that, I thought that they were mostly free BSD.

31:37.100 --> 31:40.980
But it seems that you hear less and less of that these days, don't you?

31:40.980 --> 31:42.860
Big companies using it.

31:42.860 --> 31:50.740
And Linux is just so popular now, and used in everything from smartphones to supercomputers,

31:50.740 --> 31:51.740
as we always say.

31:51.740 --> 31:57.700
It just feels that there's not really that relevance anymore, apart from ZFS, which you

31:57.700 --> 32:03.020
can get on Ubuntu, and you can make work on Linux.

32:03.020 --> 32:07.420
And most of the software that's running on Linux is permissively licensed anyway, and

32:07.420 --> 32:11.580
the kernel's GPLv2, which is not that restrictive.

32:11.580 --> 32:14.300
So I personally can't see any real argument.

32:14.300 --> 32:19.940
I know there'll be BSD people who have got a ton of arguments for it, but I don't know

32:19.940 --> 32:25.820
about dying, but becoming less and less relevant maybe is the best way to put it with BSD.

32:25.820 --> 32:26.820
I'm not so sure.

32:26.820 --> 32:33.220
I seem to recall articles about Linux dying off back in the day, and one of the aspects

32:33.220 --> 32:38.700
of the BSD license is you don't really ever have to say or contribute anything.

32:38.700 --> 32:42.220
And so you can take and run that code, and you could run it for years.

32:42.220 --> 32:44.620
Like look at the Yahoo infrastructure, for example.

32:44.620 --> 32:48.340
They contribute open source code, but they don't really have to make a big deal out of

32:48.340 --> 32:49.340
it.

32:49.340 --> 32:55.020
Contrast that when, say, Google releases Android source code back upstream to the Linux kernel.

32:55.020 --> 32:56.080
That's a big deal.

32:56.080 --> 33:00.780
They're required to do it by the user license, and the entire process is out in the open,

33:00.780 --> 33:03.220
so it's there for everyone to see.

33:03.220 --> 33:05.180
So I think that also plays a factor here.

33:05.180 --> 33:10.180
The GPL sort of forces all of this out in the open, which means companies using Linux

33:10.180 --> 33:12.640
by that very nature get more exposure.

33:12.640 --> 33:16.220
And you're going to definitely hear from some folks that say the license matters, and that

33:16.220 --> 33:21.460
BSD license or those MIT license, my co-host on Coda Radio, he prefers to release under

33:21.460 --> 33:25.460
the MIT license, and we've talked about it a lot on the show.

33:25.460 --> 33:28.740
He prefers to not release under the GPL, and he has a lot of reasons for that.

33:28.740 --> 33:32.700
Well, it seems that he's not alone, because increasingly that's what people seem to be

33:32.700 --> 33:33.700
going for.

33:33.700 --> 33:36.140
It's, I think, the most popular license on GitHub, isn't it, MIT?

33:36.140 --> 33:37.860
Yeah, I do believe I read that.

33:37.860 --> 33:42.380
