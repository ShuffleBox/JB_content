00:00.000 --> 00:09.400
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 163, recorded on November 15, 2020.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.400
I'm Chris.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.400
And I'm Wes.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.400
Hello, Wes.

00:12.400 --> 00:13.400
Let's do the news.

00:13.400 --> 00:18.760
And let's start with a fix landing for Ubuntu users that allowed standard users to gain

00:18.760 --> 00:20.400
root access.

00:20.400 --> 00:25.000
We're finding this out from a blog post by Kevin Backhouse, a researcher over at GitHub

00:25.000 --> 00:30.400
who describes an astonishingly straightforward way to escalate privileges on Ubuntu.

00:30.400 --> 00:34.720
With a few simple commands in the terminal and a few mouse clicks, a standard user can

00:34.720 --> 00:38.040
create an administrator account for themselves.

00:38.040 --> 00:42.160
The first series of commands triggered a denial of service bug in a daemon called account

00:42.160 --> 00:46.920
service, which, as its name suggests, is used to manage user accounts on the computer.

00:46.920 --> 00:53.240
To do this, Backhouse created a symlink that linked a file named.pam environment to slash

00:53.240 --> 00:59.320
dev slash zero, changed the regional language setting, and sent account service a sig stop

00:59.320 --> 01:00.780
signal.

01:00.780 --> 01:04.840
With the help of a few extra commands, Backhouse was able to set a timer that gave him just

01:04.840 --> 01:08.760
enough time to log out of the account before account service was crashed.

01:08.760 --> 01:13.520
And when he does this just right, Ubuntu would restart and open a window that allowed the

01:13.520 --> 01:19.000
user to create a new account that, you guessed it, had root privileges.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.240
Backhouse said that Ubuntu uses a modified version of the account service that contains

01:23.240 --> 01:26.840
code that's not necessarily included in the upstream version.

01:26.840 --> 01:30.800
That extra code looks at that pam environment file in the home directory.

01:30.800 --> 01:35.600
By making a file that symlinks to dev0, pam environment gets stuck in an infinite loop.

01:35.600 --> 01:42.080
There's also a second bug, and that bug involved a hack that resided in the GNOME display manager,

01:42.080 --> 01:46.020
which among other things manages the user session and login screen.

01:46.020 --> 01:50.120
The display manager, which is often abbreviated as GDM3, also triggers the initial setup of

01:50.120 --> 01:54.000
the OS when it detects there is no users that currently exist.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.900
Yeah, that was the problem, Chris.

01:56.900 --> 02:00.800
We've all seen that setup screen when you're first configuring your computer on a GNOME-based

02:00.800 --> 02:01.800
system.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.960
If you don't have any accounts, well, you need to set one up.

02:03.960 --> 02:08.520
Unfortunately, what happens here is GDM tries to do a talk to account service to check like,

02:08.520 --> 02:10.880
hey, are there any users on the system?

02:10.880 --> 02:15.240
But the code, well, there's a small problem in that the variable is already set to false

02:15.240 --> 02:16.800
is are there users?

02:16.800 --> 02:21.400
And since that call never completes, that variable never gets changed to true, and it

02:21.400 --> 02:23.640
just shows you that screen right away.

02:23.640 --> 02:24.640
OK.

02:24.640 --> 02:29.560
Yeah, and in fact, Backhouse says that he discovered these essentially by accident.

02:29.560 --> 02:34.400
The Ubuntu account service issue was fixed on November 3, and the GNOME desktop issue

02:34.400 --> 02:37.960
was patched a day later on November 4.

02:37.960 --> 02:43.720
The vulnerability only impacted desktop users, and it required access to the GUI.

02:43.720 --> 02:47.600
So not necessarily easy to exploit in most cases.

02:47.600 --> 02:52.040
I suppose that that said, you could be a maniac like me and occasionally install a desktop

02:52.040 --> 02:55.280
environment on your server, but not most.

02:55.280 --> 02:59.600
Most people don't normally do that, but sometimes I find it handy, actually.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.840
So install your patches.

03:01.840 --> 03:06.960
According to the Ubuntu notes, all releases from 16.04 LTS to the most recent 2010 were

03:06.960 --> 03:10.380
affected, and the team cranked that out and got that fix out.

03:10.380 --> 03:11.380
So go get them installed.

03:11.380 --> 03:16.280
You know, I do think this is kind of noteworthy just in that these days, most vulnerabilities,

03:16.280 --> 03:20.120
you know, they require some code knowledge, some trickery, some complicated setups of

03:20.120 --> 03:24.120
memory, state, and corruption, and this was all just done by basic Linux commands in the

03:24.120 --> 03:26.960
terminal in the GUI, which is kind of interesting.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.440
I should also stress here that the author points out that, you know, he spent a lot

03:30.440 --> 03:34.480
of time recently looking for bugs in Ubuntu, and you shouldn't take this to mean that Ubuntu

03:34.480 --> 03:35.480
is filled with bugs.

03:35.480 --> 03:36.480
That's not his experience.

03:36.480 --> 03:40.440
He looked for a lot and happened to find this one by accident, but there's a lot of eyes

03:40.440 --> 03:42.880
here, and in general, it's secure.

03:42.880 --> 03:47.640
It seems like it was actually relatively easy to surface in certain scenarios, but you really

03:47.640 --> 03:52.120
have, you had that situation with GDM that perhaps the Ubuntu development team didn't

03:52.120 --> 03:56.560
even consider, because that's such an edge case there, where, you know, GDM comes up

03:56.560 --> 04:01.880
and it wants to be super helpful, and then in that environment, it leads to a problem,

04:01.880 --> 04:04.260
but it's good to see everything fixed.

04:04.260 --> 04:06.960
Those of you in the industry may be familiar with Proxmox.

04:06.960 --> 04:12.320
Well, they've just released an open-source, Debian-based enterprise backup solution.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.240
We are big fans of Proxmox here at Jupyter Broadcasting.

04:15.240 --> 04:19.280
Used it for years, and it's been a bit, but we were just talking about trying it again,

04:19.280 --> 04:22.940
and this backup server news might just be the excuse we need.

04:22.940 --> 04:27.440
If you're not familiar with Proxmox, it's a virtualization suite that supports really

04:27.440 --> 04:33.680
two ways to run your workloads, either something container-based with LXC or full virtualization

04:33.680 --> 04:39.120
with KVM, and then on top of that, it includes a web console, command line tools, a REST

04:39.120 --> 04:44.580
API for third-party tools, and some really high-end enterprise features that you need

04:44.580 --> 04:45.580
with virtualization.

04:45.580 --> 04:47.440
Now, it's been around for about 12 years.

04:47.440 --> 04:51.840
It started in April in 2008, and this is a nice addition to this.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.600
This backup server looks pretty cool, and I like that it's based on Debian.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.600
Yeah, all right.

04:56.600 --> 05:01.160
So the Proxmox backup server is based on the latest Debian Buster release, and it's powered

05:01.160 --> 05:04.320
by the long-term supported Linux 5.4 kernel series.

05:04.320 --> 05:09.120
It also uses powerful open-source technologies like ZFS on Linux for advanced file system

05:09.120 --> 05:11.080
and volume management.

05:11.080 --> 05:15.360
It supports things like incremental backups, data deduplication, compression, and authenticated

05:15.360 --> 05:16.360
encryption.

05:16.360 --> 05:17.600
And Chris, you'll like this.

05:17.600 --> 05:22.920
Using Rust as an implementation language guarantees high-performance, low-resource usage, and a safe, high-quality

05:22.920 --> 05:23.920
code base.

05:23.920 --> 05:24.920
Well, at least in theory.

05:24.920 --> 05:25.920
It must be.

05:25.920 --> 05:26.920
No, it must be.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.600
It's proven because it's Rust.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.240
This is nice to see this.

05:31.240 --> 05:35.520
There are various subscription models available with Proxmox and the backup server.

05:35.520 --> 05:39.200
Obviously, if you're running this thing in production, that's always recommended you

05:39.200 --> 05:43.480
get access to the enterprise repository and support, so it's probably pretty important.

05:43.480 --> 05:47.800
But the cool thing about Proxmox and why we wanted to mention it here in the show is it's

05:47.800 --> 05:51.720
also free for you to go download and use fully featured for the most part.

05:51.720 --> 05:56.160
You don't get access to some of the enterprise updates and obviously the enterprise support,

05:56.160 --> 06:00.520
but you can get a real sense of what's possible with this virtualization suite, and you can

06:00.520 --> 06:04.840
take a headless Linux box and turn it into like a closet VM machine.

06:04.840 --> 06:09.500
Or here in the studio, we used to run encoding systems on it, and a lot of the things we

06:09.500 --> 06:14.960
transitioned to the cloud, we first ran here locally on-premises, and Proxmox is just a

06:14.960 --> 06:15.960
great way to do it.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.280
So this backup server is pretty nice to see.

06:18.280 --> 06:23.440
The incremental backups means that you're gonna have the minimum amount of transfer

06:23.440 --> 06:30.120
for these VMs, which means maybe even WAN backups might be possible.

06:30.120 --> 06:34.680
Data deduplication, I should say, compression, and authenticated encryption are also available.

06:34.680 --> 06:40.280
So that to me is speaking like this is seriously something maybe even for offsite VMs.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.280
I gotta play with it.

06:41.280 --> 06:45.520
Yeah, I mean, I think having ZFS built right in, I would probably use that to roll my own

06:45.520 --> 06:46.800
backup server anyway.

06:46.800 --> 06:50.500
And so you can either adopt this standalone if you just need a backup server, and here's

06:50.500 --> 06:51.880
a great open source offering.

06:51.880 --> 06:56.240
But if you're already using Proxmox virtualization solution, this just integrates right in, right?

06:56.240 --> 07:00.800
It makes it super simple through the web GUI to go back everything up, take snapshots,

07:00.800 --> 07:03.720
restore from those snapshots, and it seems pretty nice.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.880
And of course, we've been talking about this in the context of virtual machines, but with

07:06.880 --> 07:10.440
Proxmox, it's good to keep in mind that it supports containers.

07:10.440 --> 07:14.520
So the Proxmox backup server will also support backing up your containers.

07:14.520 --> 07:16.160
Yeah, it gets fancier than that.

07:16.160 --> 07:20.560
They even have support for granular restore where you can do file level restore of container

07:20.560 --> 07:21.560
backups.

07:21.560 --> 07:26.200
Even better, they've got some interesting items on their roadmap, including LDAP and

07:26.200 --> 07:29.520
Active Directory authentication and two factor support.

07:29.520 --> 07:33.160
Support for backing up other solutions, things like their mail gateway, or actually backing

07:33.160 --> 07:37.240
up the Proxmox host itself to the backup server.

07:37.240 --> 07:40.520
And what I'm excited for, tape support.

07:40.520 --> 07:46.640
Now as a final note, Proxmox backup solution is AGPL, and we'll have links to everything

07:46.640 --> 07:52.480
we've talked about here, including their Git repository in our show notes.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.080
Linode.com slash land.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.960
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards your new account.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.680
Linode is our server hosting provider and they can be yours too.

08:00.680 --> 08:05.400
They provide virtual servers that make it easy and affordable for you to host anything

08:05.400 --> 08:06.540
in the cloud.

08:06.540 --> 08:09.640
They have native SSD storage on these virtual machines.

08:09.640 --> 08:14.820
So you get really fast disk IO and Linode costs 30 to 50% less than major cloud providers

08:14.820 --> 08:18.320
like AWS or Google Cloud or Azure.

08:18.320 --> 08:21.440
And they've been around three years before AWS started.

08:21.440 --> 08:23.080
They started with a love for Linux.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.060
They saw what KVM could do.

08:25.060 --> 08:28.600
They saw what the Linux kernel user mode could do and all of that.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.480
And they've built something around it that's pretty special.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.240
And as the years have gone on, they've made it better and better.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.940
They're independently owned and they're founded on a love for Linux.

08:35.940 --> 08:40.880
And because they got started in this thing so early on, they were able to build a diverse

08:40.880 --> 08:43.820
flexible network powered by Linux.

08:43.820 --> 08:47.960
They just recently, I think on like November 9th, put up a blog post that talks a little

08:47.960 --> 08:52.460
bit about their networking model and why it's particularly useful for developers that need

08:52.460 --> 08:55.900
really low latency high speed connections between their servers.

08:55.900 --> 08:58.460
They got data centers in 11 places around the world.

08:58.460 --> 09:01.800
So there's probably ones either close to you or close to your client.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.560
You combine that with the high speed disk and the nice high end systems that you can

09:05.560 --> 09:08.360
get and you can have something extremely high performance.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.640
But maybe you need something approachable.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.680
Well they have systems that start at $5 a month.

09:12.680 --> 09:18.400
You want to host a portfolio or a blog or a website that you could even back with object

09:18.400 --> 09:21.020
storage so it's crazy super fast.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.080
All of that's available.

09:22.080 --> 09:26.780
And when you go to linode.com slash LAN, you get that $100 60 day credit.

09:26.780 --> 09:27.920
You can really try it.

09:27.920 --> 09:29.160
You can really see what it's capable of.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.960
Maybe build yourself a VPN box.

09:30.960 --> 09:35.640
I've been asking people to tweet me at Chris LAS what they do with their Linodes and I've

09:35.640 --> 09:40.340
heard some really cool stories about how people can use SSH to do amazing things.

09:40.340 --> 09:43.200
And a $5 a month rig is perfect for that.

09:43.200 --> 09:47.640
And like myself I heard from someone who set up a Minecraft server for their kids on Linode.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.100
Also really great for that.

09:49.100 --> 09:51.640
Check out linode.com slash LAN to get started.

09:51.640 --> 09:54.360
You go there, you support the show, it lets them know you heard about it here and it gets

09:54.360 --> 09:57.340
you that $100 60 day credit.

09:57.340 --> 09:58.340
Go there.

09:58.340 --> 09:59.340
Check them out.

09:59.340 --> 10:00.340
See what they have.

10:00.340 --> 10:01.960
And also by the way, Linode's often hiring.

10:01.960 --> 10:06.280
Go to linode.com slash careers to see if they have a job position that might fit you.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.200
There could be a great opportunity there.

10:08.200 --> 10:13.520
Linode.com slash LAN receive a $100 60 day credit, support the show and much more.

10:13.520 --> 10:16.920
Linode.com slash LAN and thanks to Linode for sponsoring Linux Action News.

10:16.920 --> 10:22.360
I don't know if you heard Chris, but Bitcoin, well, it's up again.

10:22.360 --> 10:23.360
It's outrageous.

10:23.360 --> 10:28.440
Yeah, we talked about PayPal and their eventual support for Bitcoin.

10:28.440 --> 10:29.560
Well guess what?

10:29.560 --> 10:30.880
It's already here.

10:30.880 --> 10:35.520
The CEO of PayPal noted too with the announcement of it going live that the shift to supporting

10:35.520 --> 10:40.340
crypto was driven what he sees by inevitable drift towards virtual currencies.

10:40.340 --> 10:46.640
But like you touched on, Wes, every time the price comes up, people start getting Bitcoin

10:46.640 --> 10:47.640
crazy.

10:47.640 --> 10:51.320
Here's a sample of a little mainstream coverage of a very technical topic.

10:51.320 --> 10:55.040
PayPal cashing in on the crypto craze, a payment company announcing a new feature that will

10:55.040 --> 10:59.200
allow users to buy, sell and hold crypto currencies, including Bitcoin.

10:59.200 --> 11:03.600
The news any Bitcoin soaring more than 7 percent to its highest level of the year.

11:03.600 --> 11:07.520
And our next guest is a crypto pro who says PayPal just gave a major stamp of approval

11:07.520 --> 11:09.440
for the entire crypto space.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.280
Joining us now is coinshare's chief strategy officer, Melton Demurers.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.560
Melton, great to see you.

11:13.560 --> 11:14.560
It's been a while.

11:14.560 --> 11:15.560
It has been a while.

11:15.560 --> 11:16.560
I feel like Bitcoin's exciting again.

11:16.560 --> 11:17.560
So here we are.

11:17.560 --> 11:18.560
It's great to be back.

11:18.560 --> 11:19.560
Here we are.

11:19.560 --> 11:25.040
In fact, we have the Bitcoin bug back up in the corner because it's gotten so exciting

11:25.040 --> 11:26.040
now.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.960
Gotta have that live price tracker, Wes.

11:27.960 --> 11:28.960
Of course.

11:28.960 --> 11:29.960
Yeah.

11:29.960 --> 11:34.680
And so PayPal has has gone live with its support as it as it said it would.

11:34.680 --> 11:36.480
There's there's, of course, some gotchas in there.

11:36.480 --> 11:38.760
PayPal's in this to make money after all.

11:38.760 --> 11:41.360
And so there's transaction fees and whatnot.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.360
Yeah.

11:42.360 --> 11:46.960
And actually, in an interesting twist, your coins can't really leave PayPal.

11:46.960 --> 11:47.960
So you can hold them.

11:47.960 --> 11:48.960
You can buy them.

11:48.960 --> 11:52.520
You can trade them back into, you know, into the currency of your choice, but you can't

11:52.520 --> 11:53.520
take them with you.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.520
Yeah.

11:54.520 --> 11:55.520
Yeah.

11:55.520 --> 11:59.600
And like global support from PayPal, I don't think really comes until 2021.

11:59.600 --> 12:03.360
So it's sort of limited in the rollout at this point.

12:03.360 --> 12:11.440
And for to say nothing about using Bitcoin to actually pay PayPal merchants, that's also

12:11.440 --> 12:12.800
a ways off still.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.000
But it's kind of getting there.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.480
I mean, I guess I guess this is early days.

12:17.480 --> 12:20.720
So they have time to kind of hone this just right.

12:20.720 --> 12:23.760
You also just have to figure for a company like PayPal, they've got to figure out a hold

12:23.760 --> 12:28.840
such a volatile currency and represent that information accurately to users.

12:28.840 --> 12:32.820
Could you imagine people who are not really familiar with this to the point that we just

12:32.820 --> 12:33.820
heard from that clip?

12:33.820 --> 12:35.320
The excitement is ridiculous.

12:35.320 --> 12:40.480
I actually got a telegram from my mom last night asking me if I was familiar with the

12:40.480 --> 12:44.560
cryptos and if I was if I was following any of the cryptos.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.880
Everybody's talking about it again.

12:45.880 --> 12:48.520
As we record, it's just below 16,000.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.800
It was over 16,000 this weekend.

12:50.800 --> 12:55.520
And it seems to be like an annual tradition, like every year as we approach the end of

12:55.520 --> 12:59.280
the year, Bitcoin just goes crazy on this and we talk about it here on the show.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.560
And here we are again now because of PayPal.

13:01.560 --> 13:04.120
And this is adding in some ways a lot of legitimacy.

13:04.120 --> 13:08.280
I mean, you heard in that clip to to people who are in the financial markets, a company

13:08.280 --> 13:13.200
like PayPal getting behind something like this is a serious nod of legitimacy and approval

13:13.200 --> 13:15.760
and brings it a little bit more to the mainstream.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.080
Now I think that's the key.

13:17.080 --> 13:20.280
If you're already interested in crypto currencies, you already have Bitcoin of your own.

13:20.280 --> 13:23.860
You're probably not going to go use PayPal solution, at least at the moment.

13:23.860 --> 13:26.360
But many folks already have a PayPal account.

13:26.360 --> 13:27.360
I know.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.360
I know I do.

13:28.360 --> 13:29.360
And that makes it pretty easy.

13:29.360 --> 13:33.240
You just got to go set up their PayPal cash account so you can actually store cash there,

13:33.240 --> 13:37.080
transfer some stuff from your bank and then you can just buy Bitcoin or Ethereum or Bitcoin

13:37.080 --> 13:38.080
cash or Litecoin.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.540
Man, 2020 is a weird year.

13:40.540 --> 13:44.560
What's nice to see about this, though, is and this will be a differentiator as time

13:44.560 --> 13:45.560
goes on.

13:45.560 --> 13:49.100
PayPal has received the first conditional bit license from the New York Department of

13:49.100 --> 13:54.200
Financial Services, which is one of the most hawkish subnational financial regulators in

13:54.200 --> 13:55.200
the US.

13:55.200 --> 13:58.320
So many have noted that the fact that it got that's a good sign and the PayPal's crypto

13:58.320 --> 14:02.240
services would entail coins that are bought on the platform and would not be able to leave.

14:02.240 --> 14:06.400
And that may be tied back to this conditional bit license.

14:06.400 --> 14:11.760
We will see it may be a compromise they had to make to bring crypto currency to a wider

14:11.760 --> 14:13.740
audience on the PayPal platform.

14:13.740 --> 14:20.220
And if that is a limit of their conditional bit license, that could have long term limiting

14:20.220 --> 14:22.080
effects on what the service is capable of doing.

14:22.080 --> 14:24.360
I think, you know, there are some things in their favor there.

14:24.360 --> 14:28.480
And at least at the moment, Bitcoin seems to be more of a, you know, a store for value

14:28.480 --> 14:32.120
differentiator in your portfolio than it is really for buying things in the street day

14:32.120 --> 14:33.120
to day.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.120
True, true.

14:34.120 --> 14:38.560
So we've talked about Bitcoin, but there's also Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin support,

14:38.560 --> 14:40.120
I believe, in PayPal as well.

14:40.120 --> 14:41.120
Indeed.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.720
So it's not all just one crypto.

14:42.720 --> 14:46.800
And you obviously are not in direct control of your private keys.

14:46.800 --> 14:50.000
PayPal doesn't give you access to your cryptocurrency keys.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
So you're not going to be able to take them out of PayPal and store them in your own wallet.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.480
And that's something people should be aware of.

14:54.480 --> 14:58.320
Yes, it's very much if you're going to get into this, you're doing it on PayPal's terms.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.320
Yeah.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.640
Otherwise, you're gonna have to learn some more technical solutions.

15:01.640 --> 15:05.480
Well, some breaking changes may be inbound to system D 247.

15:05.480 --> 15:08.840
Funny enough, though, it all stems from a kernel change in 4.14.

15:08.840 --> 15:11.260
Yeah, that long ago.

15:11.260 --> 15:15.980
It was a change designed to allow user space to handle devices that needed a little bit

15:15.980 --> 15:18.960
of help before they could become fully functional.

15:18.960 --> 15:24.280
To do that, the kernel added two new event types called bind and unbind.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.280
Why is that a problem?

15:25.280 --> 15:30.620
Well, it all comes down to Udev, which unfortunately has an assumption built in that there will

15:30.620 --> 15:35.200
only be one event associated with, say, plugging in a new device.

15:35.200 --> 15:39.040
And well, with two new events, that's no longer true.

15:39.040 --> 15:42.560
At first, system D did have a short term fix.

15:42.560 --> 15:45.080
But that was just to ignore the new events.

15:45.080 --> 15:48.440
And obviously, that was never going to be a long term solution.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.560
They have now come up with a long term solution.

15:50.560 --> 15:55.280
But unfortunately, some parts of that solution have some unfortunate implications for users

15:55.280 --> 15:56.880
with custom Udev rules.

15:56.880 --> 15:57.880
Yeah.

15:57.880 --> 16:04.800
So we seem to have two fixes and the first fix is a change in how tags will work for

16:04.800 --> 16:05.800
Udev.

16:05.800 --> 16:10.040
Now, if you're not familiar, tags are special properties that can be attached, then matched

16:10.040 --> 16:13.280
in subsequent rules or consumed by user space.

16:13.280 --> 16:18.360
So rather than attaching tags to events, as is currently done, Udev will start attaching

16:18.360 --> 16:23.240
them to devices so that tags added in response to, say, an add event will still be there

16:23.240 --> 16:27.320
when that second bind event shows up and you won't lose all the state and you won't be

16:27.320 --> 16:30.980
in a confusing place where your device didn't actually initialize successfully.

16:30.980 --> 16:31.980
That's nice.

16:31.980 --> 16:38.520
Then there's that second fix, which may affect people with custom Udev rules, something that's

16:38.520 --> 16:40.800
going to probably cause distribution some work.

16:40.800 --> 16:41.800
Right.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.200
So you've got all these Udev rule sets, which can match on these tags, perform actions after

16:45.200 --> 16:47.460
devices are added or removed.

16:47.460 --> 16:51.460
The problem here is that a lot of these rules were written under the assumption that no

16:51.460 --> 16:53.700
new event types would be added.

16:53.700 --> 16:58.200
So anything that wasn't recognized as adding or modifying a device, well, that could just

16:58.200 --> 16:59.940
be ignored.

16:59.940 --> 17:03.000
That's not the case now, and that's where the breaking change comes in.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
We need new rules.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.440
They're going to have to write new Udev rules.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.440
Exactly.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.440
Wilson, break.

17:08.440 --> 17:12.680
Everyone's quick to jump on the system to hate train, but they're actually saying this

17:12.680 --> 17:13.780
one's not on us.

17:13.780 --> 17:18.360
This is actually technically on the kernel and that change that happened at 4.14.

17:18.360 --> 17:21.980
Was this a violation of the kernel's no regressions rule?

17:21.980 --> 17:25.320
The answer must almost certainly be yes.

17:25.320 --> 17:31.000
Food that worked with the 4.13 kernel no longer worked with 4.14, but what should have been

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
done about it?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.440
Well, that's a bit less clear.

17:33.440 --> 17:34.440
Yeah, indeed.

17:34.440 --> 17:37.100
And the other thing is, is it was kind of hard to track this one down.

17:37.100 --> 17:40.740
This is one of those funny things about open source software development.

17:40.740 --> 17:48.040
The bug was first reported on KDE's Bugzilla, not to the kernel team, not to system D, but

17:48.040 --> 17:52.360
on the KDE Bugzilla, and you can kind of see how that would take a while to work its way

17:52.360 --> 17:53.360
through the process.

17:53.360 --> 17:56.600
Yeah, I mean, it was almost a year later by the time it made it to the kernel mailing

17:56.600 --> 17:57.600
list.

17:57.600 --> 18:02.240
And by that time, 4.14 had been anointed an LTS release and distributed by distributions.

18:02.240 --> 18:06.720
Yeah, and the kernel team may be ultimately responsible.

18:06.720 --> 18:11.740
I mean, I guess the system D team could make that call here because of the change in 4.14,

18:11.740 --> 18:16.680
but I think what it really has underscored is maybe not who's at fault, but how to keep

18:16.680 --> 18:22.040
all of these teams in sync and properly communicating because they each have their own mailing list,

18:22.040 --> 18:25.920
but that's not really the place for this style of collaboration, because if you zoom out,

18:25.920 --> 18:31.480
what we have here is a bug that was caused by the kernel a long time ago that impacted

18:31.480 --> 18:37.800
the way system D behaved, which is forcing a breaking change for Udev.

18:37.800 --> 18:42.480
And then ultimately users who are relying on these Udev rules, and it's a big, messy,

18:42.480 --> 18:47.640
complicated ecosystem, but fundamentally we're all working on that same system, and we would

18:47.640 --> 18:53.160
probably have an easier time of it if we could talk things through a little bit more.

18:53.160 --> 18:57.760
Linux.ting.com, go there to get $25 off a device, or if you bring a device, and you

18:57.760 --> 19:00.800
probably can, you'll get $25 in service credit.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.360
And rest assured, Ting's going to have you covered.

19:02.360 --> 19:06.280
They have three nationwide networks you can pick and choose from, which means they support

19:06.280 --> 19:07.960
a lot of devices too.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.280
Ting is really simple mobile that just makes sense.

19:10.280 --> 19:13.960
It's a fair price for however much you talk, text, and however much data you use.

19:13.960 --> 19:16.080
If you use less, you pay less.

19:16.080 --> 19:19.600
I'm on Wi-Fi during the day, so Ting makes a lot of sense for me.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.840
And when you combine the nationwide coverage, it means there's a lot of options when I travel.

19:22.840 --> 19:25.160
And the brilliant thing about Ting is their dashboard.

19:25.160 --> 19:27.920
They have the best dashboard in the industry.

19:27.920 --> 19:29.800
You can take control of your entire account.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.720
You can see your usage at a glance.

19:31.720 --> 19:35.200
You can set usage alerts, which I think is pretty great.

19:35.200 --> 19:36.800
And let's talk devices.

19:36.800 --> 19:40.360
With Ting, the BYOD options are crazy with their three network support.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.360
So go to linux.ting.com.

19:42.360 --> 19:46.880
Support there, support the show, get that $25 credit, and then click on the Check Your

19:46.880 --> 19:47.880
Phone link.

19:47.880 --> 19:52.720
When you click on that, you'll plug in your phone's IM, EI number, put it all in there.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.320
They'll tell you if you can bring it over or not.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.800
It's really simple.

19:55.800 --> 19:59.640
And you can get that simply off your phone by doing star pound zero six pound.

19:59.640 --> 20:02.880
And then you get that number, you put it in the website, see what you can do.

20:02.880 --> 20:06.600
Of course, you can buy devices from Ting directly as well or get a SIM card.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.520
Ting has all of these really nice features.

20:08.520 --> 20:11.440
And you might wonder, what is it about Ting that makes it possible?

20:11.440 --> 20:13.160
Well, they're an MVNO.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.840
Are you familiar with that?

20:14.840 --> 20:16.920
It's a mobile virtual network operator.

20:16.920 --> 20:19.320
They ride on top of several networks.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.420
So they don't have to worry about building the towers.

20:21.420 --> 20:22.980
They can focus on customer support.

20:22.980 --> 20:24.800
They can focus on high value.

20:24.800 --> 20:27.120
They really have something special here.

20:27.120 --> 20:32.760
70% of MVNO customers that were surveyed recently said they were extremely happy with their

20:32.760 --> 20:35.520
service and pricing, satisfied or very satisfied.

20:35.520 --> 20:38.520
And Ting is at the very top of that stack.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.000
Nobody doesn't like Ting.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.320
MVNOs are pretty great.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.840
And Ting is the top.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.500
They're the one that they're the leader.

20:44.500 --> 20:45.500
Everybody follows Ting.

20:45.500 --> 20:46.800
So you should check them out.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.080
They really get the pricing right.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.120
They get the options right.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.880
And they nail the support.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.760
Linux.ting.com.

20:52.760 --> 20:57.460
Go there, try them out and see why people love using Ting and see if your phone's compatible.

20:57.460 --> 20:58.920
And then you have no contract.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.480
You just pay for what you use.

21:00.480 --> 21:01.860
Great price.

21:01.860 --> 21:03.280
Use less, pay less.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.380
That's the brilliant thing about Ting.

21:05.380 --> 21:07.240
That's Linux.ting.com.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.840
Thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Action News.

21:09.840 --> 21:16.160
And thanks to everyone who supports the show by going to linux.ting.com.

21:16.160 --> 21:22.200
KDE and Pine64 are announcing today the imminent availability of the new PinePhone KDE Community

21:22.200 --> 21:23.200
Edition.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.200
Hmm.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.200
Very interesting.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.560
And I think we're all pretty familiar with Plasma Mobile.

21:27.560 --> 21:31.700
As you know, it's a direct descendant from KDE's successful Plasma desktop.

21:31.700 --> 21:36.560
And there's some underlying technologies that drive both the desktop environment and the

21:36.560 --> 21:37.560
mobile environment.

21:37.560 --> 21:40.520
There are things in there like KDE Connect, which obviously lets you connect your phone

21:40.520 --> 21:44.880
to your desktop, Ocular for document reading, Wave for music playing, and a bunch of other

21:44.880 --> 21:48.760
apps that work both in phone mode and in desktop mode.

21:48.760 --> 21:53.200
Now of course, the idea of having mobile devices that can display a full workstation desktop

21:53.200 --> 21:57.120
when connected to a monitor, keyboard, and mouse has been around for years.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.400
Hey, don't call it convergence.

21:59.400 --> 22:04.460
And both the KDE Community and Pine64 have been working to make it a reality.

22:04.460 --> 22:08.320
The PinePhone handset itself is also ready for that convergence.

22:08.320 --> 22:12.880
You can use any USB-C dock to connect it to an extra USB device like mouse, keyboard,

22:12.880 --> 22:13.880
storage.

22:13.880 --> 22:17.120
You can also connect it to external monitors or even a wired network.

22:17.120 --> 22:21.180
And in fact, the three gigabyte version of the PinePhone already comes with a dock that

22:21.180 --> 22:26.200
provides two extra USB ports, a full size HD video port, and an RJ-45.

22:26.200 --> 22:30.120
Yeah, I love the idea of having Ethernet on my phone.

22:30.120 --> 22:32.340
On your phone.

22:32.340 --> 22:35.760
This also comes at a nice time for Plasma Mobile in general.

22:35.760 --> 22:40.800
Michael Larbrel over on Pharaonyx has a nice write-up about some of the niceties that are

22:40.800 --> 22:47.840
landing in Plasma Mobile here towards the end of 2020, kind of polishing things off.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.280
And they've worked hard on this.

22:49.280 --> 22:53.520
And they just put out a report, an October 2020 report, outlining all of the strides

22:53.520 --> 22:55.520
they've made in like the last month and change.

22:55.520 --> 23:00.240
Yeah, some of those nice accomplishments are stuff like support for task switcher thumbnails.

23:00.240 --> 23:05.320
That's always nice, tweaks to the task panel appearance, and a whole bunch of refactoring

23:05.320 --> 23:08.400
for their spacebar, SMS, and MMS handling application.

23:08.400 --> 23:14.400
Yeah, so the PinePhone is kind of becoming the go-to for community firmwares and different

23:14.400 --> 23:17.360
desktop, sorry, phone environments.

23:17.360 --> 23:18.360
That's a tricky one.

23:18.360 --> 23:23.500
But what's nice about the Plasma Mobile version is we haven't seen a lot of these environments

23:23.500 --> 23:25.400
that are Qt-based.

23:25.400 --> 23:28.740
And Plasma seems like they've really put a lot of work into this mobile version.

23:28.740 --> 23:33.320
So you finally get to see some hardware that's really going to showcase this desktop environment.

23:33.320 --> 23:38.280
And for those of you who aren't huge GTK fans, you've got something non-GTK to throw on a

23:38.280 --> 23:39.400
device now.

23:39.400 --> 23:43.440
But if it doesn't work for you, you've still got all of the other OSs that you can load

23:43.440 --> 23:44.440
on the Pine 64.

23:44.440 --> 23:45.960
It's just an SD card swap away.

23:45.960 --> 23:47.840
Hey, that's the power of Linux.

23:47.840 --> 23:52.740
Well, from the next billion dollar industry file, we have some more eBPF news.

23:52.740 --> 23:58.200
Some things are coming out because eBPF Summit just wrapped up a couple of weeks ago.

23:58.200 --> 24:05.200
And just a few days ago, Cillium announced a massive $29 million Series A financing round

24:05.200 --> 24:08.720
backed by Anderson Horowitz, Google, and Cisco.

24:08.720 --> 24:13.320
And what's kind of unique about Cillium and great about them is they're early adopters

24:13.320 --> 24:15.880
and heavy users of eBPF.

24:15.880 --> 24:21.280
Cillium is an open source project that's been designed on top of eBPF to address the networking,

24:21.280 --> 24:26.840
security, and visibility requirements of container workloads, especially our friend Kubernetes.

24:26.840 --> 24:32.000
It provides a high level abstraction on top of eBPF that basically lets Linux kernel better

24:32.000 --> 24:33.640
integrate with these Kubernetes workloads.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.340
That's probably getting more and more important.

24:36.340 --> 24:42.820
And during a Q&A session after Greg Cache's talk at the Linux application summit that

24:42.820 --> 24:48.120
just happened this last weekend as we're recording this, Greg Cache said something that caught

24:48.120 --> 24:49.120
our attention.

24:49.120 --> 24:54.280
He said, out of all of the technologies as the kernel's number two, as the commander

24:54.280 --> 24:59.200
Riker of the Linux kernel, out of all of the technologies he's excited about, eBPF has

24:59.200 --> 25:00.200
got to be one of the top.

25:00.200 --> 25:01.200
All right.

25:01.200 --> 25:05.720
eBPF, if you care about networking and networking control planes and stuff like that, and tracing

25:05.720 --> 25:10.880
and modifications of the kernel as it runs, eBPF is great.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.840
You don't have to write kernel modules anymore.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.760
You don't have to write drivers anymore.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.200
You can do some really cool stuff.

25:16.200 --> 25:18.960
eBPF just keeps getting better and better.

25:18.960 --> 25:19.960
There's more.

25:19.960 --> 25:23.520
There's an eBPF conference last week.

25:23.520 --> 25:24.920
So go look at the notes for that.

25:24.920 --> 25:26.560
There's a book now about it.

25:26.560 --> 25:30.200
It changes all the time in the kernel, but it's really, really, really good.

25:30.200 --> 25:34.700
If I was buying and selling kernel stocks in new technologies for the Linux kernel,

25:34.700 --> 25:37.280
this would be one I'd be, buy, buy, buy.

25:37.280 --> 25:40.720
I know where I'm investing my Bitcoin.

25:40.720 --> 25:44.760
There was one other technology that he was really super excited about, but I'm going

25:44.760 --> 25:50.840
to save that clip for this week's Linux Unplugged, where I also have an Epic Dell laptop review.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.840
So once you get done listening to Linux Action News, make sure you save a little bit of room

25:53.840 --> 25:56.860
for Linux Unplugged, because it's going to be a good one this week.

25:56.860 --> 25:59.980
But that does bring us to the end of this week's Linux Action News.

25:59.980 --> 26:05.160

Links to everything we talked about today at linuxactionnews.com slash 163.

26:17.000 --> 26:21.480
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

26:21.480 --> 26:47.560
Thanks for joining us, and we'll see you next week.
