00:00.000 --> 00:08.560
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 110 recorded on June 16th, 2019.

00:08.560 --> 00:09.560
I'm Chris.

00:09.560 --> 00:10.560
And I'm Joe.

00:10.560 --> 00:11.560
Hello, Joe.

00:11.560 --> 00:12.680
Good to be connected with you.

00:12.680 --> 00:18.600
And we start out this week with Mozilla's plans to offer a premium subscription, potentially

00:18.600 --> 00:19.800
inside of Firefox.

00:19.800 --> 00:24.880
Yeah, this is something that was rumored kind of just before we recorded last week, but

00:24.880 --> 00:28.480
I didn't have any official confirmation, so I dismissed it.

00:28.480 --> 00:31.120
But sure enough, Mozilla have now confirmed this.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.760
We don't have many details.

00:32.760 --> 00:37.080
All we know is that there will be some sort of subscription service.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.420
Firefox will continue to be free.

00:39.420 --> 00:45.320
It's likely to be the VPN service that they've already been promoting and possibly some other

00:45.320 --> 00:46.320
stuff.

00:46.320 --> 00:50.440
Well, what we know at this point is Mozilla seems to be getting ready, at least in the

00:50.440 --> 00:57.240
early stages of offering a plan, a subscription, some sort of reoccurring bill that would allow

00:57.240 --> 01:02.500
users to access certain premium features inside Firefox.

01:02.500 --> 01:05.400
One could imagine a VPN service or cloud storage.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.760
It's really kind of unclear at this point what the service will offer.

01:09.760 --> 01:15.040
But Mozilla's CEO, Chris Beard, mentioned that both a VPN service and a cloud storage

01:15.040 --> 01:17.320
service would be a safe bet.

01:17.320 --> 01:22.920
And Mozilla seems intent on offering a subscription starting in October of this year.

01:22.920 --> 01:27.140
So this is yet another example of them preparing for the future when the search revenue dries

01:27.140 --> 01:28.140
up.

01:28.140 --> 01:34.300
And I've seen quite a lot of cynicism about this, because Mozilla have got loads of money.

01:34.300 --> 01:36.000
They've got loads coming in at the moment.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.360
But you have to think long term as an organization.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.720
And that search revenue will dry up eventually.

01:42.720 --> 01:43.880
We don't know when that's going to be.

01:43.880 --> 01:45.080
Is it going to be two years?

01:45.080 --> 01:46.080
Is it going to be five years?

01:46.080 --> 01:47.400
Is it going to be 10 years?

01:47.400 --> 01:48.520
Who knows?

01:48.520 --> 01:53.400
But it's not a great idea to wait until your revenue stream dries up and then think of

01:53.400 --> 01:55.040
the new one.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.560
It's kind of a good idea to have them cross over.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.520
So I'm all in favor of this.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.640
Some people are really outraged about it and saying, well, that's it, I'm moving off to

02:02.640 --> 02:04.280
Brave or whatever.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.080
But it's going to be totally optional.

02:06.080 --> 02:08.080
I'm probably not going to opt into it.

02:08.080 --> 02:13.200
But if a few hundred thousand people do, a few thousand people, whatever, then at least

02:13.200 --> 02:15.000
there's some revenue coming in for them.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Yeah, absolutely.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.280
I feel like what's setting some people off might be the language Mozilla is already using

02:21.280 --> 02:23.560
before they've even launched the service.

02:23.560 --> 02:28.240
I get where they're coming from, but Mozilla is trying to reassure everyone and they write

02:28.240 --> 02:34.520
a high performing, free and private by default Firefox will always continue to be the central

02:34.520 --> 02:37.800
element to our core service offering.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.440
That's according to the senior vice president of Firefox.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.600
He released that in a statement.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.680
I actually think it's a brilliant move.

02:44.680 --> 02:50.080
Not only does it make them directly responsible for revenue generation so they don't have

02:50.080 --> 02:54.400
to depend on a partner, which I think is very critical for their long term sustainability,

02:54.400 --> 02:58.740
but to me it seems like they're clearly leveraging a strength of their brand.

02:58.740 --> 03:04.200
People trust Mozilla and Firefox to have the best interest of the web and individual privacy

03:04.200 --> 03:06.480
and security in mind.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.240
And I appreciate sort of a slow approach, a slow ramp up.

03:09.240 --> 03:12.640
They're starting with VPN services, they're starting in certain areas, but you can kind

03:12.640 --> 03:16.400
of get the feeling, especially when you look at the broader picture here, they're really

03:16.400 --> 03:18.120
building towards something else.

03:18.120 --> 03:23.920
And to that end, Joe, that's why I think they're embarking on this total rebrand process and

03:23.920 --> 03:26.800
really trying to come up with a new central brand for Firefox.

03:26.800 --> 03:31.680
And they're now talking about Firefox not as a web browser, but Firefox as a quote unquote

03:31.680 --> 03:32.680
brand.

03:32.680 --> 03:36.480
It's a brand that is an umbrella of services now.

03:36.480 --> 03:41.560
Yeah, there was a post on the Mozilla blog this week, Firefox, the evolution of a brand.

03:41.560 --> 03:48.000
And it talks about the change in visual identity, which didn't they just change their logo of

03:48.000 --> 03:50.120
last year, but whatever.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.120
It's more than that, isn't it?

03:51.120 --> 03:57.480
It is more about making Firefox itself be a brand, as you said, beyond just the browser.

03:57.480 --> 04:01.080
And that seems quite smart to me because Firefox is a name that a lot of people know.

04:01.080 --> 04:04.840
They might be using Chrome, but they're at least aware of Firefox.

04:04.840 --> 04:12.480
And if they can expand that brand to encompass these services, then that's a pretty smart

04:12.480 --> 04:13.720
move by them, I think.

04:13.720 --> 04:14.720
I think that's just it.

04:14.720 --> 04:18.760
They need something outside the browser that still takes advantage of what they would say

04:18.760 --> 04:21.080
is their brand equity.

04:21.080 --> 04:25.520
They write on their blog, the Firefox you've always known as a browser is stretching to

04:25.520 --> 04:32.040
cover a family of products and services, united by putting you and your privacy first.

04:32.040 --> 04:36.840
Now Firefox has a new look to support its evolving product line.

04:36.840 --> 04:44.380
Today we're introducing the Firefox parent brand, an icon representing the entire family

04:44.380 --> 04:46.260
of products.

04:46.260 --> 04:48.960
What that family includes, you got to wait and see.

04:48.960 --> 04:54.560
Well, there's already some things, Firefox send, Firefox monitor, Firefox lockwise, which

04:54.560 --> 04:59.560
was originally lockbox, there must have been some issue with trademarks there or something,

04:59.560 --> 05:05.480
and obviously the Firefox browser, and anything else they come up with with this VPN service

05:05.480 --> 05:07.000
or whatever.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.720
And it's all using the same brand identity.

05:09.720 --> 05:12.120
And I think it looks all right, really.

05:12.120 --> 05:17.240
Some people have said that it looks horrible and looks like some other stuff, but it seems

05:17.240 --> 05:18.240
all right to me.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.520
Unicorn puke, I think I've heard.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.360
Yeah, I don't think it's that.

05:21.360 --> 05:23.200
People are saying that it's too rainbowy or whatever, but-

05:23.200 --> 05:25.760
It's missing a few colors of the rainbow, Joe.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.760
It's not that rainbowy.

05:26.760 --> 05:30.120
There's a few key colors missing from those logos.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.960
Well, yeah, exactly.

05:33.960 --> 05:38.120
There's no green in it, for example.

05:38.120 --> 05:41.980
I honestly think that it looks quite modern and stuff.

05:41.980 --> 05:46.060
We've gone through logo changes recently, and no one likes it.

05:46.060 --> 05:51.400
No one likes a refreshed brand, but if you don't change your logos ever, then you end

05:51.400 --> 05:53.040
up looking dated.

05:53.040 --> 05:58.120
And so, I don't know, I'm not a hugely visual person, but I think that this looks all right

05:58.120 --> 05:59.120
to me.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.120
Yeah.

06:00.120 --> 06:03.440
And when you look at where they're going with all of this, to me, I can't help but think

06:03.440 --> 06:05.080
this is the right way to do it.

06:05.080 --> 06:10.360
This is a mature, you build on top of user trust and on top of brand trust, and you layer

06:10.360 --> 06:16.300
on services that can directly finance a bigger, broader mission.

06:16.300 --> 06:21.240
You compare that with Librem 1, which is really kind of a haphazard rush job, where they took

06:21.240 --> 06:26.020
a bunch of open source projects, rebranded them without permission, threw them all on

06:26.020 --> 06:31.880
a single digital ocean droplet and said, privacy and security, everybody, without really having

06:31.880 --> 06:35.880
any kind of market trust, where Mozilla is doing the exact opposite.

06:35.880 --> 06:40.280
Yeah, you can have your issues with Mozilla's political stances or some of the things they've

06:40.280 --> 06:43.920
done in the past, or even the business deals they've made.

06:43.920 --> 06:50.180
But you can't really argue with the mission they've been on to make the web more open.

06:50.180 --> 06:55.040
And you really can't argue with the fact that they have really taken user privacy and

06:55.040 --> 06:56.840
security seriously.

06:56.840 --> 07:00.940
It's clear from the recent releases of Firefox, and it's been clear from the communications

07:00.940 --> 07:02.280
from the company.

07:02.280 --> 07:06.560
And instead of it just being some company that's been around for a couple of years,

07:06.560 --> 07:08.080
this is Mozilla.

07:08.080 --> 07:13.260
They really have a shot here at making something unique, private and secure.

07:13.260 --> 07:18.720
As an on and off Firefox user and a long time fan of what Mozilla is trying to do, I'm ready

07:18.720 --> 07:21.520
to directly finance their mission.

07:21.520 --> 07:25.880
That's something I can get behind, not for tribalism signaling or because I want everybody

07:25.880 --> 07:31.400
to think I'm all in on privacy and security, but just because I believe in the long term

07:31.400 --> 07:34.400
mission and their track record.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.520
And that that's a big thing here, the track record.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.720
Well, I don't think I'm going to contribute to this, but I'm going to continue to use

07:39.720 --> 07:40.720
Firefox.

07:40.720 --> 07:44.840
I'm going to visit all the different websites with Firefox and send my message that way

07:44.840 --> 07:47.360
that Firefox is not irrelevant.

07:47.360 --> 07:53.320
And if enough of us continue to use it, then it will stay around, hopefully.

07:53.320 --> 07:58.440
And I think a small percentage of users will go for this subscription service.

07:58.440 --> 08:01.560
And hopefully that'll be enough to keep them afloat and keep them on their mission.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.960
Oh, you mean Firefox free?

08:03.960 --> 08:04.960
That's cool.

08:04.960 --> 08:06.720
You can be a Firefox premium user, Joe.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.920
You can be a free user, a Firefox basic.

08:09.920 --> 08:13.200
You know that's where it's going.

08:13.200 --> 08:17.640
You know the story that got my attention, like totally like, what this week was Apple

08:17.640 --> 08:23.040
joining the open source cloud native computing foundation, which is a Linux foundation jam.

08:23.040 --> 08:27.120
Yeah, I was completely taken aback by this and looking into it.

08:27.120 --> 08:29.240
It's not a huge financial contribution.

08:29.240 --> 08:36.480
It's maybe around $50,000, but it's more about the message that it sends than the actual

08:36.480 --> 08:37.480
contribution.

08:37.480 --> 08:43.000
Well, and part of that membership also gets you a seat on the governing board.

08:43.000 --> 08:50.800
So Apple's senior engineer, Tom Adorn, will join the board of the cloud native computing

08:50.800 --> 08:52.400
foundation.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.240
So that $50,000 gets you something.

08:54.240 --> 08:58.680
It gets you something, but it makes me wonder, why would Apple be interested in this?

08:58.680 --> 09:06.160
I know that they use AWS quite a lot for iCloud, which is just funny that your Apple stuff

09:06.160 --> 09:10.720
is all being backed up to a Linux server somewhere, but I just don't understand the motivation

09:10.720 --> 09:11.720
behind this.

09:11.720 --> 09:16.820
Well, as an iPhone user, I'm perfectly happy to have my backend services powered by Linux.

09:16.820 --> 09:24.240
Let me tell you, Apple is joining 89 existing members that make up a group of companies

09:24.240 --> 09:29.480
that you've heard of, like Adidas is in there, Atlassian, Box, GitHub, the New York Times,

09:29.480 --> 09:30.480
Reddit, Spotify, Walmart.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.400
I mean, it's a big group of people.

09:33.400 --> 09:37.680
And in typical fashion, Apple isn't commenting on the announcement at all.

09:37.680 --> 09:44.920
They won't tell us anything, but they have released a small quote saying, we are, quote,

09:44.920 --> 09:49.360
heavy users of open source cloud native technologies, and we are looking for a way to give back

09:49.360 --> 09:50.360
to the community.

09:50.360 --> 09:51.360
That's all they said.

09:51.360 --> 09:58.080
You know, you think about it though, I'm sure not only is iCloud heavily reliant on Linux,

09:58.080 --> 10:05.480
but OS X, or I'm sorry, Mac OS is a Darwin based operating system, which is open source.

10:05.480 --> 10:11.540
And Apple's big new hotness is Swift, the programming language, which is open source.

10:11.540 --> 10:16.480
And while they haven't typically participated very vibrantly in the open source community,

10:16.480 --> 10:20.440
that kind of has changed with the launch of Swift a couple of years ago.

10:20.440 --> 10:27.160
If you follow Swift on GitHub, you can see where they're going well before Tim Cook gets

10:27.160 --> 10:29.600
up on stage at WWDC.

10:29.600 --> 10:35.440
They're legitimately participating as a full fledged open source community, including committing

10:35.440 --> 10:39.020
changes before they're even announced on stage.

10:39.020 --> 10:42.480
And I think this is just part of the new reality.

10:42.480 --> 10:46.880
The new reality is you got to play in this space if you want to be used by developers

10:46.880 --> 10:50.680
that are shipping enterprise grade and production grade applications.

10:50.680 --> 10:54.080
It feels like the whole world has just gone topsy turvy.

10:54.080 --> 10:59.480
When you've got Microsoft loving Linux now, and even Apple doing stuff like this, I just

10:59.480 --> 11:03.160
would have never contemplated it 10 years ago.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.240
I know.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.800
That is, there is something weird to it.

11:05.800 --> 11:10.380
Like when they, do you remember when Apple acquired CUPS, the common Unix printing system?

11:10.380 --> 11:11.640
That felt really weird.

11:11.640 --> 11:15.040
So we've been kind of ramping up to this for years now.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.320
But wasn't that more about stopping it going GPL?

11:18.320 --> 11:22.920
Yeah, and keeping a good printing system for Mac OS, which is also why WebKit is their

11:22.920 --> 11:23.920
thing.

11:23.920 --> 11:24.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:24.920 --> 11:25.920
There's definitely some self interest here.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.600
Well, I just can't get my head around it.

11:27.600 --> 11:32.840
But what I can get my head around is CERN deciding that open source is probably better

11:32.840 --> 11:35.400
for them than relying on Microsoft services.

11:35.400 --> 11:39.200
You know how they're serious is they've given it a name, Malt.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.200
That's how you know.

11:40.200 --> 11:44.320
It's not like, it's not like a public gambling strategy where they're trying to play chicken

11:44.320 --> 11:45.760
with Microsoft.

11:45.760 --> 11:46.760
They're serious.

11:46.760 --> 11:52.320
This actually started about over a year ago, as we record this, when CERN was anticipating

11:52.320 --> 11:56.320
that things were going to change with the Microsoft software licensing scheme.

11:56.320 --> 11:59.200
They have known this was coming to Microsoft's credit.

11:59.200 --> 12:02.520
They gave them a heads up, hey, you know, that sweetheart deal we've been giving you

12:02.520 --> 12:06.720
because, you know, you're a collaborative educational institute.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.400
We've decided we're not doing that anymore.

12:09.400 --> 12:13.600
And so when CERN got that notification, they began the Malt project.

12:13.600 --> 12:19.520
Now, the Malt project looks at the wide community and high number of users that participate

12:19.520 --> 12:24.120
in different CERN projects, and looks at how they can come up with a common technology

12:24.120 --> 12:26.760
solution that addresses all of this.

12:26.760 --> 12:29.520
This isn't something I really appreciated, but we'll have a link in the show notes.

12:29.520 --> 12:33.880
And they write, given the collaborative nature of CERN and its wide community, a high number

12:33.880 --> 12:39.200
of licenses are required to deliver services to everyone.

12:39.200 --> 12:44.720
And when traditional business models on a per user basis are applied, the cost per product

12:44.720 --> 12:49.080
can be huge and become unaffordable in the long term.

12:49.080 --> 12:55.220
A prime example of this is CERN has enjoyed special conditions from Microsoft for the

12:55.220 --> 12:57.720
last 20 years.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.720
Yeah, like eventually that was going to run out, right?

13:00.720 --> 13:05.000
By virtue of the status of being an academic institution, we thought we'd be okay.

13:05.000 --> 13:10.860
However, recently, the company has decided to revoke CERN's academic status, a measure

13:10.860 --> 13:17.240
that took effect at the end of the previous contract in March of 2019.

13:17.240 --> 13:22.780
It was replaced by a contract based on the number of users, increasing the license cost

13:22.780 --> 13:25.360
by more than a factor of 10.

13:25.360 --> 13:30.840
Oh, my God, I don't mean to laugh, but this is just stuff that users of open source never

13:30.840 --> 13:31.840
have to deal with.

13:31.840 --> 13:34.240
Well, that's not strictly true if you think about things like RHEL.

13:34.240 --> 13:35.240
Well, sure.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.240
Yeah, right.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.240
For servers.

13:37.240 --> 13:38.240
It's not so bad.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.240
You know, if you only had to license the servers.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.240
Forget CALS.

13:40.240 --> 13:44.480
I mean, RHEL doesn't have CALS, client access licenses, but you know, forget that.

13:44.480 --> 13:45.480
It's not so bad.

13:45.480 --> 13:49.760
But CERN felt like they were getting nickel and dimed when it came down to the individual

13:49.760 --> 13:54.960
contributor and they would have to license Excel and Microsoft Office and Windows.

13:54.960 --> 13:59.180
And then it got really, really expensive because they want to work with the scientific community

13:59.180 --> 14:04.480
and they want to take in input from individuals in the scientific community, but they don't

14:04.480 --> 14:08.280
want to have to buy them Excel and Microsoft Office and Windows 10 licenses to do it.

14:08.280 --> 14:14.120
Well, an organization like CERN who can put together the Large Hadron Collider and somehow

14:14.120 --> 14:20.160
take us cascading into the darkest timeline that we find ourselves in now surely must

14:20.160 --> 14:25.080
be able to do some good stuff with open source and replace these Microsoft bits of software.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.080
I'm with you.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.960
I'm completely with you, Joe.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.020
I'm very happy for them.

14:29.020 --> 14:32.820
The only thing I'm concerned about is like their low hanging fruit that they're going

14:32.820 --> 14:38.280
after is like, I mean, it's not like our weakest sauce, but it's not our strong sauce.

14:38.280 --> 14:42.320
You know, they're going for replacing Exchange and replacing Skype.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.480
That's their first step of implementation.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.960
And if open source can solve that, they're going to continue on.

14:46.960 --> 14:52.560
Couldn't they have started with like replacing IIS or replacing authentication or replacing

14:52.560 --> 14:53.560
databases?

14:53.560 --> 14:56.660
They had to start with Exchange and Skype, really?

14:56.660 --> 14:58.280
That's like worst case scenario.

14:58.280 --> 15:03.880
This is an organization that proved the existence of a hitherto unknown particle.

15:03.880 --> 15:07.600
They can sort out a FOSS version of Exchange and Skype, surely.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
Yeah, maybe.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.600
Fair enough.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.600
I hope.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.600
I hope you're right.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.120
I mean, they are running quite a bit of Linux.

15:13.120 --> 15:17.460
In fact, they run the Plasma desktop for some of their analysis machines.

15:17.460 --> 15:19.560
So it's not like they're totally new.

15:19.560 --> 15:23.480
So I mean, I just feel like they're not starting with the easy stuff.

15:23.480 --> 15:24.480
That's all.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.480
They're starting with the hardest.

15:25.480 --> 15:30.720
But this organization understands how to invest for a long term payoff.

15:30.720 --> 15:34.440
So we're not probably going to see these things in six months.

15:34.440 --> 15:40.260
But they understand that there's no point throwing that money away on Microsoft licenses

15:40.260 --> 15:44.800
when they could just invest a lot more than that right now in open source solutions, but

15:44.800 --> 15:47.400
then benefit from them forever.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.460
I hope you're right.

15:48.460 --> 15:49.500
That's a great perspective.

15:49.500 --> 15:54.440
Like they understand the long game because of the very nature of their work.

15:54.440 --> 15:57.440
And considering they have some Linux experience, you could be right.

15:57.440 --> 16:01.360
I think what it is for me is Munich wrecked me.

16:01.360 --> 16:03.760
You could see in Munich like all of this potential.

16:03.760 --> 16:08.760
They were going to convert an entire government and thereby a state to Linux.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.640
And then they just they screwed it up.

16:11.640 --> 16:13.800
They screwed it up in like the old school way.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.760
Like they built their own distro.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.120
They forked their own version of open office.

16:18.120 --> 16:24.300
Like it was just a mess that created a technical debt that was too much to support.

16:24.300 --> 16:28.120
And I think that taught me the most successful Linux switches and deployments are when you

16:28.120 --> 16:33.640
go mainline, when you are close to a vendor solution that can be supported by an industry

16:33.640 --> 16:35.400
of consultants.

16:35.400 --> 16:40.360
What I'm reading here is like, I don't know, it's not quite that.

16:40.360 --> 16:42.280
It's feeling like it has potential for failure.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.280
I shouldn't.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.280
I shouldn't even say this.

16:44.280 --> 16:47.440
I should just sit here and be like, great, great, certain switching to Linux, what's

16:47.440 --> 16:48.440
to worry about?

16:48.440 --> 16:49.440
I really should just say that.

16:49.440 --> 16:53.320
I should even consider the ramifications and the possibilities where this could go wrong.

16:53.320 --> 16:57.040
But I feel like that's the problem with doing this for over a decade.

16:57.040 --> 17:01.120
I've watched some transition to Linux that have gone exceptionally well.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.780
And I've watched some transitions that have gone bad.

17:04.780 --> 17:11.840
And when you start your transition with trying to replace Exchange and Skype, you're either

17:11.840 --> 17:15.360
doing it totally right and just trying to like bite off the hardest thing possible at

17:15.360 --> 17:17.920
the very beginning, or you're doing it totally wrong.

17:17.920 --> 17:19.840
And we just don't know yet, in my opinion.

17:19.840 --> 17:21.720
I think we've been doing this show too long, man.

17:21.720 --> 17:22.720
We've switched roles here.

17:22.720 --> 17:28.040
I was supposed to be the cynical one, but I just have a lot of faith in the people.

17:28.040 --> 17:30.880
They're the smartest people in the world, as far as I'm concerned.

17:30.880 --> 17:35.560
I don't have a lot of faith in scientists and the scientific method and all of that.

17:35.560 --> 17:36.560
So I don't know.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.560
I'm going to remain positive about this.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.560
And I'm going to say, don't worry.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.720
It's not going to be short term, but in the long term, this is going to work out brilliantly.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.760
This is the best thing that could have happened to open source.

17:46.760 --> 17:51.040
And I think in 10 years, we'll be looking back at this saying that, wow, I'm so glad

17:51.040 --> 17:52.040
they did this.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.040
I hope so.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.040
I really do.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.040
I hope you're right.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.960
I just look back at recent history and think, these guys forked the universe, and who knows

17:57.960 --> 17:58.960
what they're going to do next.

17:58.960 --> 18:01.360
You just can't trust them anymore.

18:01.360 --> 18:05.640
If they hadn't forked the universe, Huawei would be shipping their new Matebook Pros.

18:05.640 --> 18:09.200
But now, in the new branch that we live in, those aren't shipping.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.440
And I'm not happy, Joe.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.600
I'm not happy.

18:12.600 --> 18:19.380
I had dreams of the perfect MacBook killer running Linux in the Huawei Matebook Pro.

18:19.380 --> 18:20.720
It looked like it had the potential.

18:20.720 --> 18:24.920
Yeah, but the reason they're not going to ship it is because of potential problems with

18:24.920 --> 18:28.720
Microsoft and them not allowing them to ship Windows on it.

18:28.720 --> 18:34.360
So who knows what Linux compatibility would have been like, but I guess we'll never find

18:34.360 --> 18:35.360
out now.

18:35.360 --> 18:40.780
Yeah, it's looking bad for Huawei when they bet on the Windows horse.

18:40.780 --> 18:41.840
Who knows?

18:41.840 --> 18:45.620
Everything coming out of there right now is just all over the map.

18:45.620 --> 18:50.040
You get one story, and then you get another story that completely just contradicts everything

18:50.040 --> 18:51.760
that you just read.

18:51.760 --> 18:55.420
But one thing that seems clear is that they're no longer going to be able to take advantage

18:55.420 --> 18:57.280
of Android.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.880
And they got a lot of phones they want to ship, and they need to ship an operating system

19:00.880 --> 19:02.120
on those phones.

19:02.120 --> 19:06.640
And that operating system may turn out to be Aurora, which is a fork of Sailfish OS.

19:06.640 --> 19:13.000
Yeah, well, here's what's really, to me personally, fascinating about this story is we are getting

19:13.000 --> 19:18.360
more misinformation around this story than I think anything I've tracked in the last

19:18.360 --> 19:20.160
decade for Linux.

19:20.160 --> 19:27.480
I mean, we've heard everything from an Android clone is just around the corner to a completely

19:27.480 --> 19:28.600
in-house OS.

19:28.600 --> 19:33.880
And now this new report from The Bell, which is a publication out of Russia, reports that

19:33.880 --> 19:40.000
Huawei is exploring, what Joe just said, Aurora OS as its alternative to Android.

19:40.000 --> 19:45.720
The publication cites two sources in Huawei who claim to be executives who discussed using

19:45.720 --> 19:53.160
Aurora OS, and the Minister of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media of the Russian

19:53.160 --> 19:56.160
Federation was also a source for this story.

19:56.160 --> 20:04.960
Aurora OS is a Russian-made mobile operating system which is forked from Sailfish OS.

20:04.960 --> 20:08.960
And this is where we find ourselves.

20:08.960 --> 20:09.960
What a story.

20:09.960 --> 20:15.760
Sailfish OS may be alive and well on Huawei phones.

20:15.760 --> 20:19.760
It really is hard to know exactly what's going on, because according to The Bell, they've

20:19.760 --> 20:22.640
shipped some of these phones for testing.

20:22.640 --> 20:28.080
But then there's a report on China Daily saying that there's been a million phones shipped

20:28.080 --> 20:30.400
and yet another operating system.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.200
It does just seem to be a cloud of misinformation, as you say.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.760
A million phones.

20:34.760 --> 20:41.240
Yeah, and they say that it's been shipping this custom in-house OS called Hongmeng on

20:41.240 --> 20:43.920
a million consumer devices.

20:43.920 --> 20:47.860
That doesn't seem possible, but who knows?

20:47.860 --> 20:50.760
It's hard to really say what's true or false coming out of China.

20:50.760 --> 20:55.160
But according to reports, Huawei's in-house software is said to be compatible with all

20:55.160 --> 21:01.240
Android applications and yet, and this is a quote from Huawei, has an increased focus

21:01.240 --> 21:07.320
on security functions to protect personal data, of course.

21:07.320 --> 21:11.400
If Google's going to shut them down, the number one thing to focus in on would be, well, but

21:11.400 --> 21:13.200
now we're more private and secure.

21:13.200 --> 21:15.760
This is one that we're just going to have to wait and see, and I suppose we'll just

21:15.760 --> 21:19.840
have to keep reporting on the developments as we see them.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.840
But I think that by the end of the year, we should know what's going on with this.

21:22.840 --> 21:28.840
We'll hopefully see a phone shipping some sort of OS, and it'll be in the hands of reviewers

21:28.840 --> 21:30.080
at least.

21:30.080 --> 21:35.240
Maybe we can see some YouTube videos or something and see exactly where they go or which direction.

21:35.240 --> 21:41.000
It seems like maybe, like Google, often have a few competing departments going in different

21:41.000 --> 21:42.200
directions.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.700
Maybe it's the same for Huawei and what actually bubbles to the surface will just be the best

21:45.700 --> 21:53.240
of them, be it an Android-based one or Sailfish or a completely from scratch operating system.

21:53.240 --> 21:58.280
I like to think that realistically, it's probably just going to be AOSP-based with some of their

21:58.280 --> 21:59.280
own services.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.600
But we'll have to see.

22:00.600 --> 22:02.320
They could take the lead in their market.

22:02.320 --> 22:07.560
They could build an operating system that isn't just for phones but also works on tablets

22:07.560 --> 22:11.480
and televisions and cars and smart wearables.

22:11.480 --> 22:12.480
We'll see.

22:12.480 --> 22:18.200
I think one thing that is true, at least in the West, is that the throw it at the wall

22:18.200 --> 22:20.480
and see what sticks approach never works.

22:20.480 --> 22:27.920
So they better get a cohesive, comprehensive, complete product ready if they want to compete

22:27.920 --> 22:31.200
and they want to sell another million devices in the West like they have recently.

22:31.200 --> 22:35.240
Well, what better way to throw off your competition than pumping out a load of misinformation?

22:35.240 --> 22:39.160
So it wouldn't surprise me if suddenly just bang, they're ready with something that's

22:39.160 --> 22:42.160
completely cohesive and thought through and developed.

22:42.160 --> 22:43.160
You know what?

22:43.160 --> 22:44.480
I like to think that's what they're doing right now.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.740
A lot of the Matebooks are canceled.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.100
The Matebooks aren't canceled.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.840
We're going to ship our own operating system.

22:49.840 --> 22:50.840
We're going to ship Sailfish.

22:50.840 --> 22:51.840
We're going to ship our own OS.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.880
No, it's going to be a remix of Android.

22:53.880 --> 22:58.560
Keep everybody guessing until you figure out what the best strategy is.

22:58.560 --> 23:01.800
Man, if that's what they're doing right now, I'm impressed.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.120
I am really impressed.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.120
And it should be.

23:04.120 --> 23:05.120
I hope it is what they're doing.

23:05.120 --> 23:09.600
Well, maybe Facebook could take a leaf out of Huawei's book because their cryptocurrency

23:09.600 --> 23:14.080
is the biggest open secret in the tech market.

23:14.080 --> 23:18.640
We've been hearing about this for months and months and months, and apparently it's going

23:18.640 --> 23:20.560
to be announced this week.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.800
And this isn't just some Mickey Mouse operation.

23:22.800 --> 23:27.400
It's going to be backed by some huge names like Visa and MasterCard.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.400
I know.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.760
It doesn't matter how much rocking back and forth in the fetal position.

23:31.760 --> 23:36.440
I do say, no, Mark, no, it's still going to happen.

23:36.440 --> 23:40.000
It turns out all that fetal position rocking did nothing.

23:40.000 --> 23:46.420
Not only is Visa and MasterCard on board, but the great and fine discerning individuals

23:46.420 --> 23:53.320
at Uber, PayPal, Stripe and Booking.com are also on board with this new cryptocurrency,

23:53.320 --> 23:59.600
which will reportedly be called Libra, which triggers me so deep down I can't even get

23:59.600 --> 24:01.380
into right now.

24:01.380 --> 24:08.260
And it will be unveiled supposedly June 18th, 2019, according to TechCrunch, with a full

24:08.260 --> 24:11.120
rollout planned for 2020.

24:11.120 --> 24:17.080
It's expected to function as what is called in the community a stablecoin, which means

24:17.080 --> 24:22.320
it will be pegged to a basket of government issued currencies in order to limit the volatility

24:22.320 --> 24:29.720
of cryptocurrencies that are usually associated with things like Doge or Bitcoin.

24:29.720 --> 24:36.260
Stability is a pretty big concern, especially if Facebook is hoping to attract users in

24:36.260 --> 24:38.820
developing countries, Joe.

24:38.820 --> 24:40.380
Imagine this.

24:40.380 --> 24:45.680
Imagine a future where Facebook's currency, Libra, which I can't even say out loud without

24:45.680 --> 24:51.580
laughing, becomes the default currency for nations.

24:51.580 --> 24:55.000
If that happens, I'm just going to turn in my internet card and go live in the mountains.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.000
I'm done, Joe.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
I'm done.

24:57.000 --> 25:03.160
It's going to be called Libra because it's going to liberate everyone from the shackles

25:03.160 --> 25:05.200
of the fiat currencies.

25:05.200 --> 25:09.440
Oh, I don't mean to be a snowflake, Joe, but I'm getting triggered.

25:09.440 --> 25:14.800
Look, Facebook have got the user base already.

25:14.800 --> 25:19.120
If they wanted to, and this is speculation at this stage, but if they want to push it

25:19.120 --> 25:25.600
in front of every single active user in prime advertising spots, potentially on mobile where

25:25.600 --> 25:31.120
advertising is pretty minimal, like Google do, they put stuff on their homepage and it

25:31.120 --> 25:35.280
just like Chrome, for example, they put it on there and then completely dominated the

25:35.280 --> 25:36.520
browser market.

25:36.520 --> 25:42.040
If anyone can push cryptocurrencies into the mainstream, it feels like it has to be one

25:42.040 --> 25:48.280
of the huge companies, the huge tech companies, and Facebook seems as well placed as any to

25:48.280 --> 25:49.280
do that.

25:49.280 --> 25:53.160
Well, they can make the deals with Uber, so you could get Uber eyes with the Facebook

25:53.160 --> 25:54.160
coin.

25:54.160 --> 25:55.600
They could integrate it into Instagram.

25:55.600 --> 25:59.940
Obviously, they can integrate it into their advertising platform for Facebook, which is

25:59.940 --> 26:04.780
user generated, and they can integrate it into the Facebook messenger.

26:04.780 --> 26:10.840
They are in a very, very, very good position with about, what is it, two billion users

26:10.840 --> 26:11.840
a month?

26:11.840 --> 26:15.960
They're in a pretty good position to pull something off like this.

26:15.960 --> 26:19.840
It just makes me want to go live in a van down by the river.

26:19.840 --> 26:27.360
Well, yeah, and the question is, is this just this sort of death rattle of a company that

26:27.360 --> 26:34.760
is on its way down that's been just rocked by privacy scandals and is just becoming irrelevant

26:34.760 --> 26:35.760
and irrelevant?

26:35.760 --> 26:40.560
Instagram is still very much relevant, but Facebook itself, their main platform, seems

26:40.560 --> 26:44.400
to be becoming less and less relevant, and I wouldn't imagine your kids would have anything

26:44.400 --> 26:48.280
to do with it, for example, and all the older people who are on it are eventually going

26:48.280 --> 26:54.280
to die, so eventually, Facebook will just go the way of MySpace, probably.

26:54.280 --> 26:59.480
It's either just a desperate attempt by them to stay relevant, and this kind of thing,

26:59.480 --> 27:04.320
you would imagine, has been worked on for months and years, probably, and so it was

27:04.320 --> 27:13.840
probably started during the heady $20,000-ish days of Bitcoin, and it's probably taken this

27:13.840 --> 27:18.200
long to actually work through all the bureaucracy and everything to get it to be announced,

27:18.200 --> 27:23.600
and then even so, it's going to be at least another six months before you can use it.

27:23.600 --> 27:28.440
So it's either just them desperately trying to stay relevant, or it is actually going

27:28.440 --> 27:32.280
to work and it is going to bring cryptocurrencies to the masses.

27:32.280 --> 27:36.260
I don't know, I think probably the former rather than the latter, if I'm being honest.

27:36.260 --> 27:37.260
It is the former.

27:37.260 --> 27:38.260
It is the former.

27:38.260 --> 27:41.800
We are just at the very, very beginning, and so many of the issues that you just cited

27:41.800 --> 27:44.560
don't even matter to so many people around the world.

27:44.560 --> 27:46.280
They're not even aware of them.

27:46.280 --> 27:51.300
People that don't listen to this show, for example, they're not even aware of the issues,

27:51.300 --> 27:57.820
and when you look at the involvement of major financial firms like Visa or MasterCard, it

27:57.820 --> 28:05.140
shows that they're jumping on board not because they want to, but because they have to.

28:05.140 --> 28:07.680
They have to, because of Facebook's size.

28:07.680 --> 28:11.000
They have 2.4 billion monthly active users.

28:11.000 --> 28:15.340
MasterCard and Visa have to respond to that, and there's another element to the story we

28:15.340 --> 28:19.480
haven't mentioned yet, which I think Facebook will push a lot in the announcement next week.

28:19.480 --> 28:25.720
They're going to establish an independent body to manage all of this that keeps users'

28:25.720 --> 28:31.720
privacy in mind and integrates with regulators and really kind of is the face of this cryptocurrency.

28:31.720 --> 28:38.640
They're going to push that a lot next week, and I think that will shield them from a lot

28:38.640 --> 28:43.120
of the skepticism and a lot of the critical analysis is this independent body that's made

28:43.120 --> 28:53.080
up of these members like Uber, PayPal, Stripe, MasterCard, and Visa, and they'll bring legitimacy

28:53.080 --> 28:55.920
to what should be just a ridiculous idea.

28:55.920 --> 29:03.200
Well, all I can say to you and our listeners is be prepared for your non-Linux friends

29:03.200 --> 29:05.080
to start asking you about this stuff.

29:05.080 --> 29:10.200
The kind of normals who are on Facebook will suddenly become aware of this, whether it's

29:10.200 --> 29:15.200
this week when the announcement happens or whether it's early next year, presumably when

29:15.200 --> 29:16.600
it actually comes out.

29:16.600 --> 29:21.400
We will have to field questions about this, and so you'd better come up with a way to

29:21.400 --> 29:24.000
explain to them why it's good or bad.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.520
Yeah, and something else is like, go look at it.

29:27.520 --> 29:33.720
Don't just parrot anti-Facebook FUD, which I would be one of the first to do, but actually

29:33.720 --> 29:35.400
go look into it.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.400
Go see what it is.

29:36.400 --> 29:42.140
But Joe, I feel like the one thing as an old-time Bitcoin fan is you've got to think about this

29:42.140 --> 29:45.280
in one context and one context only.

29:45.280 --> 29:47.640
How is this going to affect the price of Bitcoin?

29:47.640 --> 29:49.720
A cryptocurrency goes legitimate, right?

29:49.720 --> 29:50.720
Yeah.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.440
I'm thinking it's going to massively boost it.

29:52.440 --> 29:53.440
I do, too.

29:53.440 --> 29:54.960
In fact, I think it's already priced in.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.160
I think the Bitcoin community has already seen this coming, and that's why Bitcoin's

29:58.160 --> 30:03.560
getting near $9,000 right now, which, at the beginning of the year, what was it around

30:03.560 --> 30:06.000
$6,000, maybe?

30:06.000 --> 30:09.560
Maybe $6,000 when we started recording?

30:09.560 --> 30:14.300
And now it's at $9,000 halfway through the year, and I think in part it's because of

30:14.300 --> 30:16.400
things like Facebook's Librecoin.

30:16.400 --> 30:20.840
I think we're in serious danger of getting into Bitcoin prediction territory here, so

30:20.840 --> 30:23.320
we should probably get out of here.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.320
Right.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.920
We should avoid that at all costs.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.920
And we've learned our lesson on this show, Joe.

30:28.920 --> 30:33.280
Anyways, we'll have links to all of this stuff if you guys want to read more.

30:33.280 --> 30:38.800
And I'd also kind of like to know what you think about Facebook backing a cryptocurrency.

30:38.800 --> 30:41.960
What do you think about that, especially if it's part of a larger group?

30:41.960 --> 30:44.520
Let us know, linuxactionnews.com slash contact.

30:44.520 --> 30:49.200
And while you're over there, go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new

30:49.200 --> 30:50.200
episodes.

30:50.200 --> 30:55.440
And coming up on June 25th, that's a Tuesday, at 12.30 Pacific, just before LUP, is another

30:55.440 --> 31:00.200
one of our study groups, and this one is Understanding Burnout, which is something I feel I should

31:00.200 --> 31:03.040
learn a lot more about, and probably all of us should.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.040
So yeah, come along to that.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.040
Yeah.

31:05.040 --> 31:06.040
Who knew IT was hard?

31:06.040 --> 31:07.040
Who knew?

31:07.040 --> 31:10.880
They don't tell you that when you sign up, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for

31:10.880 --> 31:11.880
the details.

31:11.880 --> 31:16.560
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

31:16.560 --> 31:18.680
I am at Chris LAS.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.360
And I'm at Jarl Ressington.

31:20.360 --> 31:23.400
Thank you for joining us, and we will see you next week.

31:23.400 --> 31:41.960
Have a great night, y'all.
