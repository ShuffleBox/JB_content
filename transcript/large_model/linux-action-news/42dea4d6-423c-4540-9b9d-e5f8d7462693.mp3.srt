00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 147, recorded on March 1st, 2020.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,600
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,600
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,600
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,600
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,160
We start with Collabra, who's brought smooth editing to Android and iOS this week.

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,720
Yes, finally, a full feature office suite on Android and iOS that is open source.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,360
Yeah, that was the part I was going to underscore, is that's what's so great about this.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,880
The Android and iOS apps are fully open source, and you get full editing features, rich copy

10
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,560
and paste support.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,320
And I decided to load it up on the old iPhone to give it a go.

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,320
And to their credit, it immediately populated with recent documents I've edited on this

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,600
iPhone that I've saved to the local files, file stores, whatever they call it on iOS.

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,960
And it reads them all, I can open them right up, it recognizes this is a markdown document,

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,160
I can go in here and edit.

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,120
I don't love the way it displays on the phone screen, but if I was on a tablet, this would

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,120
be fully usable.

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,000
Yeah, I tried it out on Android, and I didn't have any local files for it to open.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,040
So I just was starting from scratch.

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,980
And it's okay, it works reasonably well at this stage.

21
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,900
It's nowhere near as good as Google Docs.

22
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,840
So there's a way to go here.

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,280
But this is a very important first step.

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,260
Because although we've had Collabra as an app before on Android, it was pretty much

25
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,400
read only.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,480
The editing features were very much experimental and just didn't work very well.

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,700
Whereas now, it does work.

28
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,560
It's a little bit clunky.

29
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,800
There's a lot of room for improvement, but I'm very happy to see it.

30
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,720
Yeah, clearly competing against Google Docs or Apple's pages is going to be a challenge.

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,880
It's an uphill battle to take on the very own platform creators apps.

32
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,680
It's just always a rough fight.

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,360
But in the open source ecosystem, this is playing an important role.

34
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,680
But additionally, you can see the network effect and value that Collabra Office users

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,580
on the desktop would have with a mobile app now.

36
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,520
And so they'll likely be the top users of this.

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,800
It might not skyrocket to the charts on Play or on Apple Store, but it will be very useful

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,120
for the established Collabra Office user base.

39
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah, and they're not trying to make this some open source island.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,400
It will work with things like Nextcloud, but it will also work with Dropbox and proprietary

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
services.

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,960
So they are making it easy to switch over.

43
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,520
And I think the most important thing here is that they're rolling this into their paid

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:34,120
for product, Collabra Online, as a very important part of that product.

45
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,880
And they have a clear business model here, which will hopefully lead to this being successful

46
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,460
long term.

47
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,800
As you can probably imagine, this was no small task.

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,560
We'll have a link in the show notes at linuxactionnews.com slash 147 to Michael Meeks' blog where he writes

49
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,840
about the process of taking this desktop application, prototyping it for mobile, and then eventually

50
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,880
shipping it as a mobile application.

51
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,600
It's full of really cool geeky details.

52
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,520
Yeah, and the very first screenshot in it shows you how long this has been going because

53
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,840
it looks quite old school.

54
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,360
Those of us in the States have a new default rolling out to Firefox.

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,360
Yes, DNS over HTTPS.

56
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,140
We've talked quite a lot about this, but now it is default in the United States.

57
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,780
It's not going to be default anywhere else for the foreseeable future.

58
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,360
But now if you're a Firefox user and you don't change any of your settings, all your DNS requests

59
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
are going to Cloudflare.

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,520
I've been using this since we first started talking about it just so I could get some

61
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,020
real hands on experience.

62
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:42,440
And I have not noticed any difference except the one time we rebooted the pie hole here

63
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:46,760
at the studio and DNS was down for all of the machines, it was still working in Firefox.

64
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,200
And I thought, oh yeah, right.

65
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,560
But I was thinking maybe I'd see a performance improvement or something.

66
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,240
I don't notice any difference.

67
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:58,520
So they write on the Mozilla blog, which we'll link to again, DNS is a database that links

68
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,200
a human friendly name such as www.mozilla.org to a computer friendly series of numbers

69
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,640
called IP addresses.

70
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,520
By performing a lookup in this database, your web browser is able to find websites on your

71
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,940
behalf because of how DNS was originally designed decades ago.

72
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,500
Browsers doing DNS lookups for websites, even encrypted HTTPS sites had to perform these

73
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,480
lookups without encryption.

74
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,560
At the creation of the internet, these kinds of threats to people's privacy and securities

75
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,640
were known, but not yet exploited.

76
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:34,040
Today we know that unencrypted DNS is not only vulnerable to spying, but is being exploited.

77
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,660
And so we are helping the internet to make a shift to a more secure alternative.

78
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:44,980
We do this by performing DNS lookups in an encrypted HTTPS connection.

79
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,680
So I read two things from this, Joe.

80
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,000
Number one, they're kind of making the case of maybe we should have always done it this

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,060
way.

82
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:57,120
And number two, I still feel like the Mozilla organization as a whole is trying to signal

83
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,640
to us that they know about something going on with DNS, but they don't want to publicly

84
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:05,200
say what it is because they kind of sneak these lines in here.

85
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:09,680
Like DNS is not only vulnerable to spying, but is being exploited.

86
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,640
They sneak these lines into a lot of these posts, like they know about something that

87
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,960
they're not publicly sharing.

88
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,080
Are you talking about the Snowden revelations?

89
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,440
Maybe or maybe through Firefox metrics or conversations with ISPs, they've learned of

90
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,440
a lot of DNS tomfoolery going on out there for advertising purposes, spying purposes.

91
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,600
I honestly get the sense this is almost a move to protect against government he's dropping.

92
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,800
I don't know if that's going way out there with the old conspiracy bacon, but it almost

93
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,500
feels like that's what this actually is.

94
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,440
When you change a default like this for this many users at this aggressive of a pace, but

95
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,780
you also are constantly making your case, I start to think maybe there's a bigger picture

96
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,200
here that Mozilla is trying to very cleverly communicate to us.

97
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:57,440
Much like this is an odd comparison, but much like how Canonical is trying to say, hey,

98
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,240
these 32-bit libraries and software are not being properly tested and the backports may

99
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,200
not even be working properly.

100
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,840
We can't guarantee this is secure.

101
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,560
They can't say that, but they try to say it in their own language in the post when they're

102
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,520
talking about deprecating 32-bit support.

103
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:18,220
They try to communicate it without sounding alarms.

104
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,920
It feels like that's what Mozilla is doing here.

105
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:27,240
But this is not without its controversy because what they're doing is centralizing DNS.

106
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:34,000
They argue, and I don't buy the argument, that DNS is centralized anyway because in the US

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,040
you have so few ISPs, but at least you have four or five, whereas this by default is pushing

108
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,640
everything through Cloudflare, a company which they say they trust and they have a legal

109
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,380
agreement in place saying that Cloudflare are not going to sell this data or do anything

110
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,400
nefarious with it.

111
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,840
But detractors are saying this is centralizing something which is not centralized at the

112
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
moment.

113
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,240
Yeah, and that is, I think, a valid argument.

114
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,920
Of course, the counter argument could be, well, it's software.

115
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,260
They could add 100 DOE servers and then they could have Firefox randomly pick them every

116
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,640
time it does a query.

117
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,920
That could be done.

118
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,640
But Burt Herbert, the founder of PowerDNS, he's one of the vocal opponents of Mozilla

119
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
turning this on.

120
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,520
He told the Register in an interview, quote, I find it highly disappointing that Mozilla

121
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:29,280
has decided on behalf of all users, it deems American, that this was a good idea.

122
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,120
So while encrypted DNS is great, it matters a great deal who you encrypt your DNS to.

123
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,280
Mozilla has dark patterned the choice, so almost everyone will take the new default.

124
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,120
Essentially, they're saying, we decided it's best that you send all your DNS queries to

125
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,360
Cloudflare.

126
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:51,240
He goes on to add, it's far easier to defend DOE the protocol than to defend DOE the land

127
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
grab.

128
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,880
Which is a pretty valid point, isn't it?

129
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,720
I don't think anybody disagrees with it in principle as a technology.

130
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,000
It's just the implementation.

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,860
And yes, they have added Next DNS as an alternative, but defaults are king and people will stick

132
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,860
to them.

133
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:14,200
And so the vast majority of Firefox users in the US will now be using Cloudflare.

134
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,880
And I can see why that makes people uncomfortable.

135
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:24,200
But that said, anyone who really cares about it, and if you are the admin for an organization,

136
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,320
it's not impossible to completely disable this, or to switch to your own provider, there's

137
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,360
nothing stopping you rolling your own.

138
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,400
So I can understand why Mozilla have done this with Firefox, but I also understand why

139
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,480
some people are annoyed about it.

140
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,720
I think it's quite telling that whilst I have experimented with this, I checked to see if

141
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,000
I'd left it on and I hadn't yesterday.

142
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,040
And I don't think that I will be enabling it.

143
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,400
I don't know why that is.

144
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,880
I just have this strange feeling about Cloudflare.

145
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,040
And I have no evidence for it, but I just feel it's telling that I'm not using this.

146
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,400
And if I was there, I would probably turn it off.

147
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:10,200
So I think that's fundamentally what it comes down to, is who do you trust less?

148
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:18,120
And that's why this is such a hard conversation, because my ISP, my upstream DNS is Comcast.

149
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,440
I may trust Cloudflare more than Comcast, at least in 2020.

150
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,600
In 2025, I may feel differently.

151
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,600
But I guess because I put faith in Mozilla's ability to lock them down on this agreement,

152
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,560
which we have talked about in the past, we have reviewed, and does look very legitimate.

153
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,640
And both organizations publicly claim that they have agreed to this.

154
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,680
As long as that remains in place, I trust Cloudflare more than I trust Comcast.

155
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,840
I do kind of see this, I guess I could buy, I should put it, that this is a land grab

156
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,760
by Cloudflare.

157
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,960
But because it took us a total of 45 seconds for us to set up our own Doze server, and

158
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,400
then plug it into Firefox, it's not that big of a deal.

159
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:07,080
They would just take something like PFSense, and PyHole, and OpenSense, and Linksys routers

160
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,200
to build in Doze servers that would be handed out to clients over DHCP, and this centralization

161
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,480
problem starts to go away.

162
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,840
Yeah, so I suppose the argument is they needed a centralized way to push it out on a big

163
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,000
scale.

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,200
But this will hopefully drive people to accept this as the way forward.

165
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,120
And hopefully, as you say, start building it into routers and make it a universal thing

166
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,780
that isn't centralized.

167
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,920
It's one of these technology problems that is easily solvable, but not until you get

168
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,600
people actually using the protocol.

169
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,400
And I think your point there about scale is the one that we should probably end this on.

170
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:49,480
Fundamentally, who else could handle that scale of users?

171
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,920
There's got to be only a few companies in the world, and Cloudflare is built to be one

172
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
of them.

173
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Yeah.

174
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
I think you said something.

175
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,120
When you said, it took us 45 seconds to do it, you mean it took Wes 45 seconds.

176
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,280
Yeah, it totally did, because I think that container took 20 seconds to download to begin

177
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
with.

178
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:14,240
But a bit of Firefox news that got lost in all this this week is that they have rolled

179
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,940
out for Mac and Linux users a new sandbox system.

180
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,840
Get out your open source bingo card and cross off Rust, because we've got another Rust solution

181
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,840
for you.

182
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:29,320
I saw on the post here that they continue to make extensive usable sandboxing and Rust

183
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,040
in Firefox, but each has its limitations.

184
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,680
You have process level, and that works well for sandboxing large, pre-existing components.

185
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,240
But it consumes a lot of resources.

186
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,400
You see this in Chrome, and you kind of see a more sparing approach in Firefox today.

187
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:52,520
Now Rust is lightweight, but rewriting millions of lines of code in C++, it would take years

188
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,020
and set Firefox back competitively.

189
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,900
They make an example here on their website about the graphite font shaping library.

190
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:04,260
Now this guy's tricky, because Firefox uses that to render certain complex fonts.

191
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,800
It's too small, though, to put in its own process with all that overhead.

192
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,500
And yet it can be a bit of a memory hazard.

193
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:15,460
It sort of gets around the process isolation as it is right now.

194
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:21,260
So that's why they've launched Joe RL Box, which is WebAssembly meets Rust to break off

195
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:26,880
like individual library type components to isolate those little bits and pieces that

196
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,080
could be exploited even with process isolation.

197
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,160
Yeah, and as you say, this is initially just being used for the graphite font library,

198
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,320
but it is generic enough that it can be used for other stuff within Firefox and potentially

199
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,640
in other applications as well.

200
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,160
And obviously it's all open source.

201
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,200
Yeah, powered by WebAssembly and Rust.

202
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,740
So you know this thing's going to get a lot of attention.

203
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,320
And the beautiful thing is, is it lands on Linux first in Firefox 74.

204
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,960
We get it on Linux and Mac users get it in 75 with Windows support coming sometime soon

205
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
in the future.

206
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:06,640
They're all using Edge anyway, so, you know, all right, well, while we're talking about

207
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,400
the web, Tim Berners-Lee has got this crazy new idea that most of us didn't think was

208
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
going anywhere.

209
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,240
But this week, he got Bruce Schneier on board.

210
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,280
Well, that's kind of the tricky thing.

211
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,520
I think Schneier has been working with Inrupt for a little while, but this week was his

212
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,600
public outing.

213
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:27,080
Inrupt, he writes, think of that as basically the red hat of Solid.

214
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,560
So Solid is the base, and then they are going to package it up and implement it.

215
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,440
Solid was that idea that was Web 3.0 or whatever it would be, like it'd be a replacement to

216
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,480
the web we have today, where your data lives in a pod that's totally controlled by you.

217
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,940
And that could be a pod that's hosted on a cloud pod hosting provider, or it's running

218
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,560
on your LAN, Schneier even daydreams that potentially one day routers would come with

219
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,880
little pod receivers on them.

220
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:03,520
But the idea is you grant granular access to the data in your pod to whoever you want.

221
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,160
So instead of it being in a bazillion different databases all over the web, just totally disperse

222
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,360
everywhere where you have different security issues and whatnot, you control it all.

223
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,160
So if your insurance company wants to have access to your fitness data, you grant it

224
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
through your pod.

225
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,360
And if you don't want them to have access, you don't grant it.

226
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,840
Similarly, like you want to share vacation photos with friends, it'll all be pod access.

227
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,960
And then you'd need something that sits on top of this and kind of makes it all connected

228
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,960
together.

229
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,580
The idea is to be completely distributed if possible.

230
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:40,120
And I guess this in rep company is bringing together a bunch of big names to try to really

231
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,640
lend some credibility to this whole solid idea.

232
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,560
Yeah, Bruce Schneier joined as chief of security architecture, but there's some other people

233
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,160
who are involved with this now who've got a lot of experience in the industry.

234
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,880
But you know, the more I read about this, the more I feel that I don't get it.

235
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:02,440
I just feel a bit dumb, maybe it just it feels like this great idea that is just beyond me.

236
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,060
Whether they're not explaining it properly, or I'm dumb, at least that was what I was

237
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:12,520
feeling until I read a post on the Greater Manchester Combined Authority site.

238
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:18,780
This is a huge metropolitan area in the north of England, where they talk about using this

239
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:26,480
technology to safeguard the data of young children of around two and a half years.

240
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,720
And suddenly all kind of clicked into place for me.

241
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,360
That is probably one of the ideal examples.

242
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,240
So good on them.

243
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,640
My issue here is if this were to be successful, it would, it would require a lot of big corporations

244
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,840
getting on board and acting in a way that would reduce value.

245
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,240
For example, the data that Facebook owns, or the data that Google owns is truly their

246
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,760
primary value.

247
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,240
They build everything around that.

248
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,760
Why would they not want to keep that?

249
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,560
Even Schneier writes on his blog, quote, I believe this will fundamentally alter the

250
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,100
balance of power in the world where everything is a computer and everything is producing

251
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,160
data about you.

252
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,000
What we're talking about here, and I'd love to see this happen.

253
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I want to make this clear.

254
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,280
I mean, I would be, I would be happy to see this happen, totally 100%, but we're talking

255
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,880
about a fundamental shift where things go away from being controlled by corporations

256
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,640
and back to being controlled by users.

257
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,640
And it just doesn't seem like that's the general trend line of the internet these days.

258
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:35,000
Well, Thomas Carburn writing on the register nailed it as far as I'm concerned.

259
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,280
He wrote, all it will take is to win over the businesses that profit from the current

260
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:44,920
status quo and the internet users who have consistently traded privacy and control for

261
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,200
free services and delegation of responsibility.

262
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,680
I mean, the register is always quite snarky.

263
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,760
And so it kind of goes with my sense of humor, but that really just sums it all up.

264
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,240
Yeah, that's all it'll take.

265
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
That's all.

266
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,120
Well, something else that didn't get a huge amount of coverage and I think should have

267
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,900
got more is that Azure Sphere has hit general availability now.

268
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,900
It's been a little while.

269
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,500
Microsoft initially introduced Azure Sphere, which is that whole Microsoft services paired

270
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,880
with Linux running on a system on a chip with different OSes and security models.

271
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,040
They did that back in 2018.

272
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,280
The technology evolved out of a research project that was started back in 2017.

273
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,240
You remember, it's essentially a three component system.

274
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,500
It's got a processor storage and memory, and that connects back to an Azure service that

275
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:42,540
guarantees 10 years of support and metrics for failure analysis and log retrieval and

276
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:49,520
ideally a service package that makes it possible to keep IoT devices out in the marketplace

277
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,200
and out in the field, secure, up to date, and even potentially detect possible security

278
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
issues or failures.

279
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:03,560
I think why this is really important is that this is a Linux first product from Microsoft.

280
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,040
Can you even have imagined that five years ago?

281
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Right.

282
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,160
And the other thing that's kind of fascinating about it, it's their Linux.

283
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,840
It's a Microsoft distro running on this thing.

284
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,760
I kind of would love to see that.

285
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,200
Does it count as a distro if it's only on their microcontroller?

286
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,320
I don't know.

287
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,120
Did we ever consider Linux running on the TiVo A distro?

288
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,500
I'd say no, but it's something.

289
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,520
I'd still like to see it.

290
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,800
Microsoft's distinguished engineer and managing director of Azure Sphere, that's actually

291
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,120
the title, said, quote, IoT is in the science fair stage.

292
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,360
Every enterprise is doing at least one experiment here, but security is really keeping them

293
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,000
from going to scale.

294
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,480
And that's what Microsoft's trying to solve.

295
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,840
The adults have come to the room and they're now going to sell the components for you to

296
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,820
build a device, either be a washing machine, which is what some of their preview customers

297
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:59,120
built were clothes washing machines that just keep track of health and power usage and all

298
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,680
of that that some reason need Wi-Fi.

299
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,600
You want something like that to be supported for at least 10 years, and you want it to

300
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
be solid.

301
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,800
You don't want to be the brand that brought some malware into your home because you bought

302
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,120
a Wi-Fi connected washing machine.

303
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Not good for the brand.

304
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,480
So Microsoft's customers are those people.

305
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,800
Mary Jo Foley has a really good write up and she covers a bunch of the things that have

306
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:26,200
happened, including they've added support for the IMX8 ARM CPU, which is fascinating

307
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,440
because they think it's well suited to artificial intelligence, graphics, and richer UI experiences.

308
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
Hello Librem 5.

309
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,440
I thought that was interesting.

310
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,080
So you could get the same CPU and an Azure device running Linux.

311
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,080
Yeah, I hope it's got a good heat sink.

312
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,560
And probably a pretty good power source, I would hope.

313
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,840
Yeah, but the IMX8 is designed for this kind of installation, something that's mains powered,

314
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,840
and it's got great Linux support, so it's no surprise that Microsoft have added support

315
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,840
for it.

316
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,180
Well, speaking of small device surprises, there was a birthday surprise for Raspberry

317
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,180
Pi users.

318
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:05,600
Yeah, to celebrate the eighth birthday, they've lowered the price of the two gigabyte version

319
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,580
of the Raspberry Pi 4 to only $35.

320
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,200
They will keep the one gigabyte version around for industrial customers, but that's going

321
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,440
to stay at $35, so it makes no sense for a consumer to buy the one gigabyte version and

322
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,560
the four gigabyte one is going to stay at $55 as well.

323
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:31,720
So really what's happening here is the default $35 standard priced Pi is now really fast

324
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,680
and with two gigabytes of RAM.

325
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Yeah, it's not bad.

326
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,920
And if you consider inflation, when the Raspberry Pi originally launched, that $35 is nearly

327
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,560
$40 today.

328
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,440
So you're effectively getting all the improvements for a $5 price cut, as they point out on the

329
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
post.

330
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,440
So the one gigabyte model sticking around for industrial and commercial customers, as

331
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,400
they put it, and staying at the $35 price is kind of a surprising move.

332
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,800
I'm curious to know why a two gig model wouldn't work where a one gig model works today.

333
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,720
There must be applications where too much memory is bad.

334
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,320
I mean, it totally seems possible.

335
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,840
I can only think that possibly the extra power draw of two gigabytes, it's only a tiny bit,

336
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:21,760
but if you have done a lot of calculations based on exact numbers, then maybe you might

337
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,800
want to stick to the one gigabyte one.

338
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,680
And if you've certified it, maybe you'd have to go through a whole new process.

339
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,440
So maybe it's that.

340
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,920
That's what I was thinking is maybe it's just how this business works.

341
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,280
You got a product, you certify it and you know, you build it to spec and if you deviate

342
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,920
from that spec, it has to be recertified.

343
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,360
They write though that we expect most users to opt for the larger memory variants since

344
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,480
there's no price advantage.

345
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,520
So we'll see how long it sticks around.

346
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,760
But I think it opens up a real nice spot in the lineup for an eight gigabyte Pi.

347
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,200
I know that's what I was thinking.

348
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,880
If only they'd drop that four gigabyte price slightly and then bring in the eight one,

349
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,760
but it doesn't look like they're going to do that anytime soon.

350
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,440
I'd pay 80 bucks for an eight gig Pi, I think.

351
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,120
For me, it'd be a slam dunk upgrade.

352
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,560
I just pop out the SD cards and pop them in the new one because my installs are already

353
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,560
64 bit.

354
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,400
Yeah, that's the beauty of the Pi's.

355
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,040
You could take that same SD card and put it in my original one that has 256 megabytes

356
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
of RAM.

357
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,680
It reminds me honestly of the good old days where I would have a boot disk, a boot floppy

358
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,280
disk to get my OS up and then I would have to switch over to the game and I would have

359
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:42,040
to eject the OS disk and then put in a floppy disk for the game until I became a real baller

360
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:48,560
and I got two floppy disk drives and then I could have an OS drive and a game drive

361
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,760
and don't even get me started on how fast I can install an operating system.

362
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,920
Yeah, and it meant you could copy those Linux installation disks really easily as well.

363
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,720
Don't copy that floppy Joe, unless it's open source.

364
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,880
But one quick thing to mention is on the FAQs, the question is, is this a permanent price

365
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,880
cut?

366
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
And they say yes.

367
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,320
If a lot of this is to do with the fluctuations in RAM pricing, it's not going to go back

368
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,320
up again.

369
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
I love it.

370
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
Yeah.

371
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,200
They're passing the savings of the drop in price to us and they must look at it from

372
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,780
a business standpoint and figure, okay, this is going to stay this way for a while.

373
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,800
We can make this price change.

374
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,400
They're really conscious about that $35 price point.

375
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,400
Yeah, massively.

376
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,720
So that's why they were reluctant to change their system on a chip and make it possible

377
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,100
to do the four gigabyte one.

378
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:41,440
That looks like they've finally found a way to have two gigabytes of RAM for $35.

379
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,720
Imagine that five years ago.

380
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,400
I know and imagine this in another five years.

381
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,920
Yeah, very exciting.

382
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,600
Well, that just about wraps us up.
