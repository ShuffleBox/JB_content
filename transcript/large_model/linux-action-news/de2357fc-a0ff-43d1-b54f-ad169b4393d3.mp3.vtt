Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.100 --> 00:20.380
This is episode 59, recorded on June 24th, 2018.

00:20.380 --> 00:21.380
I'm Chris.

00:21.380 --> 00:22.380
And I'm Tom.

00:22.380 --> 00:23.380
Hello, Joe.

00:23.380 --> 00:28.440
It's good to be connected again from JB1 Studios in Seattle, Washington, and we kick things

00:28.440 --> 00:31.840
off this week with an Ubuntu Touch story.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.280
That's an interesting one to lead with.

00:33.280 --> 00:37.960
Yeah, Ubuntu Touch OTA4 release candidate has been released.

00:37.960 --> 00:41.920
Now yeah, this is just a release candidate, but it's pretty close to what is actually

00:41.920 --> 00:45.160
going to be released, hopefully quite soon.

00:45.160 --> 00:51.600
And it's a bit of a milestone for them, because it's based on Ubuntu 16.04 rather than 15.04.

00:51.600 --> 00:55.480
15.04, of course, is not supported anymore by Canonical.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.880
This is supported for a couple of years, so they've bought themselves a bit of runway.

00:58.880 --> 01:02.560
Yeah, and the phone release has traditionally been an LTS behind.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.140
That's normal for the phone release.

01:04.140 --> 01:07.960
But I think the bigger thing too, beyond the years of support that you get with an LTS,

01:07.960 --> 01:13.240
is it means today, currently, they'll be receiving core package updates directly from upstream,

01:13.240 --> 01:14.720
from the larger Ubuntu community.

01:14.720 --> 01:19.120
And I've actually tried this out on a Nexus 5, and I didn't have a huge amount of time

01:19.120 --> 01:23.060
to play with it, but it is pretty stable.

01:23.060 --> 01:27.280
Much better than the last time I checked out the 16.04 version of it.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.720
It feels pretty much finished to me.

01:29.720 --> 01:36.080
There are a couple of little bugs in it that they acknowledge, but otherwise, I think if

01:36.080 --> 01:42.640
you are all in on the Ubuntu touch experience and don't require certain Android apps like

01:42.640 --> 01:45.600
I do, I think you could use this as a daily driver already.

01:45.600 --> 01:50.400
Yeah, the project says you should be able to get away with using it as a daily driver,

01:50.400 --> 01:56.160
as long as you're, quote, able to endure a little suffering, which I think is a good

01:56.160 --> 01:57.320
way to put it.

01:57.320 --> 02:02.260
And the other thing I like about this release is all of the previously supported devices

02:02.260 --> 02:04.140
are still supported.

02:04.140 --> 02:07.840
And like Joe said, there are a few rough edges and bugs that you have to suffer through.

02:07.840 --> 02:10.320
They're enumerated on their post.

02:10.320 --> 02:13.880
Just go to linuxactionnews.com slash 59 for a link to that.

02:13.880 --> 02:18.480
But sort of at a bigger, higher level, it's just sort of great to see this project still

02:18.480 --> 02:19.480
going.

02:19.480 --> 02:22.760
They're not going to use it as a daily driver, but it's amazing to see that this community

02:22.760 --> 02:27.860
has picked this up and continued this effort, even after Canonical decided it was no longer

02:27.860 --> 02:29.040
for them.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.680
And it's not dead yet, Joe.

02:30.680 --> 02:35.740
It's still kicking, and they've got a good, solid release here that appears existing users

02:35.740 --> 02:39.200
of the project can update to over the air right to their device.

02:39.200 --> 02:44.280
Yeah, you can't actually do that right now, because the 15.04 version on the Nexus 5 and

02:44.280 --> 02:49.240
the RTA didn't actually come through, but that's because it's just release candidate.

02:49.240 --> 02:54.720
Once the final release comes out, hopefully very soon, then it will just work as a normal

02:54.720 --> 02:59.320
OTA, which is pretty handy for people, rather than having to manually flash it.

02:59.320 --> 03:02.080
Although you can flash it without wiping your data at the moment.

03:02.080 --> 03:06.360
I just wiped data because I didn't have much on there.

03:06.360 --> 03:11.200
But the most important thing here is if you've been following their Q&A, which they do on

03:11.200 --> 03:15.080
YouTube, but there's also an RSS feed for the audio version, which is what I catch every

03:15.080 --> 03:17.480
couple of weeks.

03:17.480 --> 03:23.720
Everything that they're planning to do depends on getting this 16.04 release done first.

03:23.720 --> 03:28.040
The Andbox stuff, which is getting Android apps working as an option for people, that

03:28.040 --> 03:30.040
requires 16.04.

03:30.040 --> 03:34.420
All of their plans in the future depend on getting this release out first.

03:34.420 --> 03:41.400
So it is not only is it getting onto an officially supported base of 16.04, it is a base from

03:41.400 --> 03:45.800
which they can then build all of their plans and all of their cool stuff that they want

03:45.800 --> 03:46.800
to do.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.480
It's just massively important to them.

03:48.480 --> 03:53.800
So I would urge people to, if you've got a compatible device, do test it for them.

03:53.800 --> 03:57.640
Look at the bugs that they're already aware of, report any new ones.

03:57.640 --> 04:00.820
And if you're a developer and you've got some time that you can spend on it, then I do urge

04:00.820 --> 04:07.920
you to contribute to the project because this is potentially one of the only Linux-based

04:07.920 --> 04:12.600
OSes for phones out there that's got any longevity to it.

04:12.600 --> 04:17.800
We'll see what happens with Purism and whether they can deliver next year, but for now, we've

04:17.800 --> 04:21.880
got Ubuntu Touch, it's here, let's try and make it the best that we can.

04:21.880 --> 04:26.400
And on the opposite end of the spectrum, another project that we're seeing some life from is

04:26.400 --> 04:28.320
Android x86.

04:28.320 --> 04:35.440
They have an 8.1 RC1 release, yeah, it's an Oreo-based x86 release of the Android project.

04:35.440 --> 04:40.760
And speaking of Purism, I gave this a go on my Librem 15.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.360
How did you get on with that then?

04:42.360 --> 04:44.220
Much better than in virtualization.

04:44.220 --> 04:51.480
They do have support for VMware and QEMU to have Mesa 3D acceleration, but boy, is it

04:51.480 --> 04:52.480
dog slow.

04:52.480 --> 04:58.240
But when you load it on physical hardware with Intel HD graphics, you get full OpenGL

04:58.240 --> 04:59.240
acceleration.

04:59.240 --> 05:06.480
And so I downloaded the 64-bit ISO and I chose the Taskbar launcher, which gives you an alternative

05:06.480 --> 05:11.120
Windows-like launch bar at the bottom, not quite like you see on Chrome OS.

05:11.120 --> 05:16.680
It's kind of a mix between what you would see on, say, Windows 10 and Chrome OS.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.520
And there's two launchers that it ships with, but I went with Taskbar because that's the

05:19.520 --> 05:21.520
one they've added with this release.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.840
And it worked pretty well.

05:22.840 --> 05:29.280
It also has modal windows, so you can maximize and they go full screen, or you can un-maximize

05:29.280 --> 05:32.020
and they're modal windows that you can drag around.

05:32.020 --> 05:35.680
So I had the Play Store open and the Twitter client open at the same time.

05:35.680 --> 05:40.940
And yes, if you're on 64-bit, the Google Play services comes pre-installed and it works

05:40.940 --> 05:41.940
pretty good.

05:41.940 --> 05:44.320
There's some bugs with the 32-bit version where it can crash.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.880
It's installed, but it's a little crashy.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.160
And I updated Chrome.

05:48.160 --> 05:55.200
I updated several apps on it and I set up my Google account, so my emails were coming

05:55.200 --> 05:57.160
in via Android notifications.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.020
It actually wasn't a horrible experience.

06:00.020 --> 06:02.720
It was a little tedious managing the Windows.

06:02.720 --> 06:06.080
But if that Librem 15 had a touch screen, it might have been a little bit better.

06:06.080 --> 06:07.840
Well, enter my VivoBook.

06:07.840 --> 06:12.600
I've got a little, I think it's an 11-inch Asus VivoBook with a touch screen.

06:12.600 --> 06:16.400
And it's almost made for Android X86.

06:16.400 --> 06:21.340
It's just a great experience having a proper keyboard to type on when you need to.

06:21.340 --> 06:24.020
And I tried out both launchers on it.

06:24.020 --> 06:27.320
One of the launchers is just very standard Android.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.540
But this Taskbar launcher, it's just great.

06:30.540 --> 06:32.160
It's kind of a little bit crumbly.

06:32.160 --> 06:34.880
It's a little bit like LXQ.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.220
It's exactly what I like.

06:36.220 --> 06:40.920
It looks very much like my XFCE desktop that I'm looking at right now, so I'm fully on

06:40.920 --> 06:41.920
board with it.

06:41.920 --> 06:45.140
Very simple, searchable menu that works exactly as it should.

06:45.140 --> 06:50.840
I'm tempted to stick it on a partition on that VivoBook and use it regularly because

06:50.840 --> 06:53.120
it's a great release.

06:53.120 --> 06:57.640
And the reason I wanted to talk about this was we actually talked about the last release,

06:57.640 --> 07:03.800
which was based on Android 7, came out in February, which was long delayed.

07:03.800 --> 07:10.080
Whereas now, I looked it up, Android 8.1 came out six months ago, and now we are almost

07:10.080 --> 07:12.240
at a final release of Android X86.

07:12.240 --> 07:15.280
Okay, that's not great, but they're improving.

07:15.280 --> 07:19.080
It shows that development is accelerating on this.

07:19.080 --> 07:22.720
In my opinion, it's better than what you get on most Android handsets.

07:22.720 --> 07:24.160
Well, exactly.

07:24.160 --> 07:25.160
Yeah.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.520
It's not too bad, a six-month window.

07:27.520 --> 07:32.520
I mean, it would be nice for them to slim that down to be day one if they could, but

07:32.520 --> 07:34.320
I can't see that happening anytime soon.

07:34.320 --> 07:40.280
And Android P is going to be out fairly soon by the looks of things, so they will end up

07:40.280 --> 07:44.240
being a release behind, but it shows that this project is not dead.

07:44.240 --> 07:48.320
And it's really cool to have it, especially if you've got a touchscreen device like I

07:48.320 --> 07:49.320
have.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.960
Unfortunately, it doesn't work on my little tablet.

07:52.960 --> 07:57.240
I don't think I've talked about this before, but a while ago, just as a kind of stupid

07:57.240 --> 08:02.400
purchase, I bought a Link 7 tablet, it's a seven-inch Atom-based tablet that came with

08:02.400 --> 08:06.920
Windows 8, and I bought it just to see if I could get Linux working on it.

08:06.920 --> 08:12.800
And Fedora actually boots straight away on it and works perfectly, so that's pretty cool.

08:12.800 --> 08:17.840
But unfortunately, it doesn't work with hardware acceleration with Android X86, so I could

08:17.840 --> 08:23.360
have had a really cheap, really quite powerful Android tablet there, but unfortunately not.

08:23.360 --> 08:28.800
Yeah, if you've got a touchscreen laptop, just boot it up live, check it out.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.840
If anything else, it's just a bit of fun, really.

08:30.840 --> 08:31.840
Yeah.

08:31.840 --> 08:35.120
I mean, to be clear, it does fully support the mouse and keyboard.

08:35.120 --> 08:40.920
So I was using it on my Librem 15 with just my trackpad and the keyboard.

08:40.920 --> 08:44.620
There was a couple of times where the mouse became unresponsive as something grabbed attention,

08:44.620 --> 08:46.880
so it wasn't a perfect experience.

08:46.880 --> 08:51.260
But there's just a couple other things they've added that do almost put this in the legitimate

08:51.260 --> 08:53.040
daily driver category.

08:53.040 --> 08:56.120
First of all, it's kind of a no-brainer if there's a couple of Android apps you really

08:56.120 --> 08:58.120
like, like the Twitter client, maybe the Evernote client.

08:58.120 --> 09:02.800
If there's a couple of official Google Play apps that you just really like, it's kind

09:02.800 --> 09:05.760
of nice to be able to just pop them into a window on your laptop.

09:05.760 --> 09:09.760
The other thing they've added in this release is hardware acceleration for video codecs,

09:09.760 --> 09:12.440
which means you can watch video on this thing and get decent battery life.

09:12.440 --> 09:16.760
I think, although I didn't run it all the way down, I think I was getting five hours

09:16.760 --> 09:17.920
on my Librem 15.

09:17.920 --> 09:21.800
At least that's what it was projecting, and I spent at least two hours of that battery

09:21.800 --> 09:22.800
life.

09:22.800 --> 09:27.680
And then something else they added for this release, which I, again, think it kind of

09:27.680 --> 09:32.400
almost makes it legitimate as a daily driver, is they've added Ethernet support.

09:32.400 --> 09:37.020
So if you've got Ethernet on your laptop or your x86 machine and it's a common chipset,

09:37.020 --> 09:40.400
it's going to work now because there's a Linux kernel powering this thing.

09:40.400 --> 09:44.040
And then the last thing that just makes it a lot of fun if you just want to play around

09:44.040 --> 09:46.940
is you can actually get this as an RPM.

09:46.940 --> 09:51.200
And you can download it, install it on an existing system, and it'll set up QEMU for

09:51.200 --> 09:52.200
you.

09:52.200 --> 09:56.480
They also have a guide for using Alien to convert it to a deb to put it on Debian systems.

09:56.480 --> 10:00.400
So you can get it as an ISO, obviously, but you can also grab it as an RPM.

10:00.400 --> 10:05.120
Well, Android may well be on the path to becoming irrelevant anyway, because surely Fuchsia is

10:05.120 --> 10:06.120
the future.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.200
Oh, man.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.600
You're raising my blood pressure just talking about it.

10:09.600 --> 10:14.700
And there's some details in the future Fuchsia releases, that's fun to say, that make it

10:14.700 --> 10:18.240
look like Linux apps could be coming to Fuchsia.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.240
What?

10:19.240 --> 10:20.880
Yeah, it's not just for mobile devices.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.920
There is some proper software in this thing to make it a full desktop stack.

10:24.920 --> 10:29.880
And one of the things they're adding is guest apps, which allow you to boot up a virtual

10:29.880 --> 10:32.200
OS inside Fuchsia.

10:32.200 --> 10:36.720
And there's support today for a Debian based environment.

10:36.720 --> 10:40.540
And now support is being added for what looks like a Chrome OS environment.

10:40.540 --> 10:46.960
And part of this is using that same Vert IO technology that so many other VMs use on Linux

10:46.960 --> 10:49.720
as part of Linux's KVM stack.

10:49.720 --> 10:54.640
Now part of the Vert IO standard is this new VSOC, the virtual socket stuff that we've

10:54.640 --> 10:59.400
talked about recently, that's enabling Chromebooks to run Linux apps.

10:59.400 --> 11:04.280
In fact, that's that VSOC kernel module is the thing that Google is backporting to older

11:04.280 --> 11:07.600
kernels to enable Linux apps on older Chromebooks.

11:07.600 --> 11:13.120
This VSOC stuff's kind of the key piece to make no mouse lag, automatic adjustment of

11:13.120 --> 11:18.660
screen resolution, supporting a copy and paste and transferring of files of virtualized applications

11:18.660 --> 11:20.840
really smooth and transparent on a desktop.

11:20.840 --> 11:26.180
That's what Vert IO with this VSOC kernel hook can accomplish.

11:26.180 --> 11:29.600
And it's the same technology in Fuchsia and Chrome OS.

11:29.600 --> 11:34.000
And when you put it all together, it looks like they're making one singular runtime across

11:34.000 --> 11:37.040
these operating systems to run Linux applications.

11:37.040 --> 11:43.040
Yeah, and suddenly this is looking less like some abstract project for the future and more

11:43.040 --> 11:46.200
like something that's coming around the corner.

11:46.200 --> 11:50.720
And it's fairly obvious why Google wants to do this, at least to me, and that is because

11:50.720 --> 11:55.720
they don't want to have the Linux kernel anywhere near it because of the GPL.

11:55.720 --> 12:00.400
Fuchsia is all permissively licensed, and that's the way they want to go with it.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.760
Yeah, that's why it raises my blood pressure when we talk about it on the show.

12:03.760 --> 12:10.600
It gets me a little anxious because Linux powering all of these mobile handsets in everybody's

12:10.600 --> 12:15.240
pockets has been a big part of the Linux success story for a long time now.

12:15.240 --> 12:21.720
And it plays a huge role in the weight that Linux devices now carry with industry manufacturers.

12:21.720 --> 12:29.280
If that were to transition to a non-GPL operating system, all of the advances in that operating

12:29.280 --> 12:34.240
system would primarily be going to one single entity, Google.

12:34.240 --> 12:40.600
See, the advantage of Android being powered by Linux today is everybody has to contribute

12:40.600 --> 12:42.360
those improvements upstream.

12:42.360 --> 12:49.320
So the general technology platform that powers things from digital ocean droplets to watches

12:49.320 --> 12:52.140
is getting the same improvements.

12:52.140 --> 12:58.960
If it's all controlled by Google, as long as the license is something where people don't

12:58.960 --> 13:02.520
have to contribute back upstream or they don't have to make it available to everybody, we

13:02.520 --> 13:04.200
all lose.

13:04.200 --> 13:10.040
As a thought experiment, imagine for a moment if every singular improvement that Apple made

13:10.040 --> 13:15.000
to the core of Mac OS had to be upstreamed to the FreeBSD project.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.160
Now I grant you, it's not based on the FreeBSD kernel.

13:18.160 --> 13:22.240
This isn't a good one-to-one comparison, but as a thought experiment, consider how much

13:22.240 --> 13:28.600
further ahead FreeBSD may be on the desktop today if all of the desktop improvements Apple

13:28.600 --> 13:30.640
had to submit back upstream.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.940
A lot of that is essentially what's happened with Android and Linux.

13:33.940 --> 13:40.120
So many improvements to power management, ARM compatibility, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, those

13:40.120 --> 13:45.400
improvements have been contributed by hundreds of different hardware manufacturers that are

13:45.400 --> 13:47.960
involved in the Android ecosystem.

13:47.960 --> 13:52.580
And it's not like Android would go away tomorrow, but if Google made a strong shift, you got

13:52.580 --> 13:56.780
to imagine a lot of Google's ecosystem would eventually make the transition with them.

13:56.780 --> 14:00.840
But the difference here is that with it being permissively licensed, Google could make it

14:00.840 --> 14:03.540
proprietary, but they haven't yet.

14:03.540 --> 14:09.480
And so that is surely the great hope here that they will keep it open source just with

14:09.480 --> 14:12.400
the insurance policy of the permissive license.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.120
But it still benefits so many less users.

14:15.120 --> 14:23.760
When you improve Linux as a whole, you improve e-commerce, you improve the education sector,

14:23.760 --> 14:27.520
you improve the life of people like me who are now broadcasting and making their living

14:27.520 --> 14:29.080
using Linux.

14:29.080 --> 14:34.600
It extends to so many areas of the ecosystem.

14:34.600 --> 14:39.800
And even if Fuchsia is, you know, I don't care what it is, MIT license, I don't care

14:39.800 --> 14:46.260
what it is, Berkeley license, I don't care if it's the, you know, the Sergey license.

14:46.260 --> 14:52.060
If they're the only people using that stack, if their IoT devices and their Android devices

14:52.060 --> 14:56.420
and maybe, you know, their laptops are the only devices using that stack, then it only

14:56.420 --> 14:59.920
benefits that narrow spectrum of an ecosystem.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.600
Yeah, but who's to say it will only be them using it?

15:02.600 --> 15:05.640
Because if it's open source, people can take it and do what they want with it.

15:05.640 --> 15:09.600
And if it's permissively licensed, then they can take it and do literally whatever they

15:09.600 --> 15:11.120
want with it.

15:11.120 --> 15:17.000
So you're going to potentially have loads of other OEMs and other companies making devices

15:17.000 --> 15:21.280
that are based off Fuchsia, but I suppose then they won't necessarily have to contribute

15:21.280 --> 15:22.280
back to it.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.600
I suppose that's the point here.

15:23.600 --> 15:28.520
Yeah, and really, I'm not expecting all of the industry to switch, you know, the server

15:28.520 --> 15:33.120
market, there's so many things that are built on top of Linux, they're going to remain on

15:33.120 --> 15:34.120
Linux.

15:34.120 --> 15:42.200
Linux will be okay, but they won't necessarily be reaping all of that developer attention.

15:42.200 --> 15:46.600
Last.ting.com, thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Action News Show.

15:46.600 --> 15:51.960
This is a way to do mobile that breaks the mold, the lock-in that the duopoly has here

15:51.960 --> 15:52.960
in the States.

15:52.960 --> 15:56.280
It's a smarter way to do mobile because if you use less, you just pay less.

15:56.280 --> 16:00.160
If you're savvy enough to use Wi-Fi while you're at work and home, then you really don't

16:00.160 --> 16:03.520
need to be paying for, I don't know what, 12 gigabytes of data or whatever you might

16:03.520 --> 16:04.520
be paying for.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.260
Like, you don't, you need to just pay for what you use.

16:06.260 --> 16:11.100
If you use a messaging application of any of them, besides SMS, you don't really need

16:11.100 --> 16:13.840
to pay for a thousand text messages, do you?

16:13.840 --> 16:18.960
I get what, three or four a month, probably mostly from two-factor stupid login systems

16:18.960 --> 16:20.880
that shouldn't even be using SMS.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.360
Why do I need to pay for a thousand messages?

16:22.360 --> 16:23.440
That'd be ridiculous.

16:23.440 --> 16:27.720
It's pay for what you use, a fair price for how much you talk, text, and data you use.

16:27.720 --> 16:32.400
So this last month, I used way more data than I'll use for the rest of the year.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.800
So I'll pay more for that month.

16:34.800 --> 16:41.920
But for the next 11 months, I'm gonna pay around 40-ish bucks a month for three lines.

16:41.920 --> 16:45.000
I got a phone and I got two MiFi devices that I use.

16:45.000 --> 16:49.760
One MiFi device is on the GSM network, and the other MiFi device is on their CDMA network

16:49.760 --> 16:50.760
because Ting has both.

16:50.760 --> 16:54.920
And I can pick and choose whichever one is stronger, and I just join my systems to that.

16:54.920 --> 16:59.720
I've got a Microtech router in my RV that connects to the different Wi-Fi access points

16:59.720 --> 17:01.880
and does a speed test.

17:01.880 --> 17:05.440
And then it'll switch to whichever Wi-Fi access point has the faster speed.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.100
And I don't have to do any of it.

17:07.100 --> 17:12.300
And legitimately, this last month of shows were recorded over the Ting connection.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.720
And often, Joe would remark, you know what?

17:13.720 --> 17:16.960
Our latency is better than when you're in the studio in Seattle because I am able to

17:16.960 --> 17:19.400
choose what works best in my area.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.720
And then to make things even better, I've got a booster up on the roof of the RV that

17:22.720 --> 17:24.340
really boosts the signal.

17:24.340 --> 17:27.140
And I can sit and have great phone calls over Ting.

17:27.140 --> 17:30.480
And I know that I'll just pay a little bit more that month.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.480
And then I'm done.

17:31.480 --> 17:32.480
It's simple.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.480
It's easy.

17:33.480 --> 17:34.480
It's pay for what you use with nationwide coverage.

17:34.480 --> 17:35.480
No contracts.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.480
last.ting.com.

17:36.480 --> 17:45.160
Okay, so let's talk about how you are suddenly regretting backing the Atari VCS.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.160
I don't know.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.740
I feel like this is a real hit piece by the register.

17:48.740 --> 17:50.920
They trolled Atari hard this week.

17:50.920 --> 17:54.880
I do agree that their PR train went off the tracks a little bit last week.

17:54.880 --> 17:59.960
Atari VCS posted a link to some register coverage on their Facebook page and added a little

17:59.960 --> 18:00.960
commentary.

18:00.960 --> 18:04.620
They said, we honestly can't explain this article.

18:04.620 --> 18:08.100
Our executive sat with that reporter for a half an hour.

18:08.100 --> 18:11.160
And he wrote what he wanted instead of what was discussed with him.

18:11.160 --> 18:16.860
Sadly, there are even irresponsible trolls in quote, professional positions, I guess.

18:16.860 --> 18:20.120
We clearly said that we were bringing engineering design models to GDC.

18:20.120 --> 18:22.960
And lots of people clearly don't understand what that means.

18:22.960 --> 18:23.960
Hunks of plastic?

18:23.960 --> 18:24.960
Well, yeah.

18:24.960 --> 18:28.120
Yeah, that's how you finalize the designs and confirm that you can get the look and

18:28.120 --> 18:31.360
feel of what you want for the finished product.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.880
Sad.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.560
And so the register had written, you know, hey, they were just hunks of plastic that

18:35.560 --> 18:36.560
didn't work yet.

18:36.560 --> 18:39.160
They didn't have any working demos.

18:39.160 --> 18:45.580
And then the register responds with a full copy of the interview with this executive,

18:45.580 --> 18:47.940
this marketing executive at Atari.

18:47.940 --> 18:48.940
And it's pretty bad.

18:48.940 --> 18:50.280
The guy doesn't have any answers.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.000
There was no product to show at the time.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.860
They hadn't even finalized the chip design.

18:54.860 --> 18:58.140
Only one of the two controllers was functional.

18:58.140 --> 19:00.400
So I agree, it doesn't sound good, Joe.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.780
Yeah, and this was back in February, when they'd already kind of missed their initial

19:04.780 --> 19:07.120
goal to get the pre-orders in.

19:07.120 --> 19:10.160
And now here we are in June, and people like you have backed this.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.960
And it's only got a week left to go.

19:11.960 --> 19:16.000
And you're thinking to yourself, well, if they had no clue what they were doing back

19:16.000 --> 19:20.800
then, maybe they are not going to be able to deliver this after all.

19:20.800 --> 19:25.800
And that original article had gone under the radar for most people.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.480
I think I'd read it at the time, but I'd forgotten about it.

19:28.480 --> 19:32.120
Whereas now they've just had the Streisand effect, haven't they, at the end of the day?

19:32.120 --> 19:36.280
I think they should have just not said anything about it.

19:36.280 --> 19:39.760
And now we're all talking about it again, and it's looking really bad for them.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.000
But it's too late.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
People have backed it.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.000
I don't know.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.520
Can you get a refund on these crowdfunding sites?

19:44.520 --> 19:45.520
I've never tried.

19:45.520 --> 19:49.120
See, I wouldn't expect anything but exactly this.

19:49.120 --> 19:52.360
Because in the interview, I listened to the whole 30-minute interview, because The Register

19:52.360 --> 19:54.880
kindly embeds it in their article.

19:54.880 --> 20:00.520
And the guy says they're not worried about building the Linux system, because they already

20:00.520 --> 20:02.840
have some early prototypes of that.

20:02.840 --> 20:03.920
That's the easy part.

20:03.920 --> 20:07.560
The hard part is going to be building the UI on top of the Linux system.

20:07.560 --> 20:08.680
I agree with that.

20:08.680 --> 20:11.440
I don't think they need to finalize any of the...

20:11.440 --> 20:17.000
It's an x86 box with an AMD CPU, and that's what it is.

20:17.000 --> 20:21.680
The design of the box, the ports, how the controllers connect, and how they interface

20:21.680 --> 20:25.440
with the software is way, way, way, way more complicated.

20:25.440 --> 20:31.160
And the deals with the different game publishing outlets, building a store around all of that,

20:31.160 --> 20:34.360
that's the hard work that is going to be really tough to pull off.

20:34.360 --> 20:38.020
And it sounds like in that interview, that stuff's already in the works.

20:38.020 --> 20:42.480
He just couldn't talk about it, because they want to play the hype game, and they want

20:42.480 --> 20:47.060
to do timed announcements with specific partners at specific times, so they just wouldn't tell

20:47.060 --> 20:48.280
The Register anything.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.720
That's where some of this is coming from.

20:50.720 --> 20:54.600
And as a backer, I'm actually not really worried.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.780
If you were to ask me, frankly, I'd say this is exactly what I'd expect.

20:57.780 --> 21:03.080
I would think they probably have a few prototypes working outside of a case that are probably

21:03.080 --> 21:07.640
not much more than a new high-end NUC at this point that they're trying out.

21:07.640 --> 21:11.120
And then I would imagine they're going to try to find the best price to performance

21:11.120 --> 21:14.640
ratio and thermal overhead, and put it in this case.

21:14.640 --> 21:19.160
And then we'll just install some x86-based Linux system on there.

21:19.160 --> 21:20.160
And they'll call it good.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.880
Yeah, well, it's going to be based on Ubuntu, isn't it?

21:21.880 --> 21:27.480
So that means that you've got all of the work that Canonical are doing there for free, essentially,

21:27.480 --> 21:28.720
because it's open source.

21:28.720 --> 21:33.080
And so then you've just got to build, well, say, just the UI and the stuff you talked

21:33.080 --> 21:34.080
about there.

21:34.080 --> 21:39.920
So not making it an ARM-based system means that you can just put more or less whatever

21:39.920 --> 21:44.320
x86 chipset in there you want, and it's going to work with Ubuntu.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.320
Right.

21:45.320 --> 21:49.560
And if you get some sweet partnership with Netflix, where they're going to open up 4K

21:49.560 --> 21:54.680
HDR streaming, then that might force you to use the most latest AMD chip.

21:54.680 --> 21:58.640
But if that deal with Netflix doesn't work out, and you're not going to have any super

21:58.640 --> 22:03.560
high-end thing pushing the machine at launch, you might go with the AMD chip that's already

22:03.560 --> 22:05.160
out and a little bit cheaper.

22:05.160 --> 22:09.200
So I could even understand not finalizing that design yet, because Linux itself is a

22:09.200 --> 22:11.080
known quantity they can already work with.

22:11.080 --> 22:14.360
The AMD hardware pipeline is pretty well-established at this point.

22:14.360 --> 22:17.480
And the box seems like it's probably got the thermal capacity for whatever they want to

22:17.480 --> 22:18.480
end up doing.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.240
It's just going to really come down to the GPU.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.840
So I'm actually thinking this is fine at this point.

22:22.840 --> 22:25.920
Maybe I'm overly optimistic.

22:25.920 --> 22:29.780
Maybe I'm going to be regretting that backing of the Atari VCS.

22:29.780 --> 22:32.960
But as of right now, I'm only at yellow alert.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.280
It's funny that you used the words, this is fine.

22:35.280 --> 22:40.200
Suddenly I'm picturing that meme with the dog and the fire.

22:40.200 --> 22:41.200
That's true.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.400
Everything seems to be fine over at Fedora, at least I think.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.960
I'm not quite sure exactly what's going on.

22:46.960 --> 22:53.560
But it appears to be the next shoe dropping in this merger of Red Hat and Core OS.

22:53.560 --> 22:58.520
Yeah, it turns out that Michael Tunnel's joke turned out to be true, calling it Fedora Core

22:58.520 --> 22:59.520
OS.

22:59.520 --> 23:00.520
It has a good ring to it.

23:00.520 --> 23:01.760
Yeah, it does have a good ring to it.

23:01.760 --> 23:04.320
Although there's a bit of baggage there with the old Fedora Core.

23:04.320 --> 23:07.120
Oh, what you call baggage, I call nostalgia.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.880
Fair enough.

23:08.880 --> 23:13.520
But now we know that this is going to be the upstream community version of Red Hat Core

23:13.520 --> 23:14.520
OS.

23:14.520 --> 23:18.560
So going off of a post that Matthew Miller made at the fedoramagazine.org site, it sounds

23:18.560 --> 23:23.400
like the new Fedora Core OS is going to be built from Fedora upstream, rather than from

23:23.400 --> 23:25.060
Core OS upstream.

23:25.060 --> 23:30.800
But the way it gets delivered will be more like the way Core OS is delivered today, containers

23:30.800 --> 23:35.440
of clustered host OS that keep themselves up to date so you just don't have to worry

23:35.440 --> 23:36.720
about it, as he puts it.

23:36.720 --> 23:42.900
Now, the technical details of how all of this is going to work are still being flushed out.

23:42.900 --> 23:45.520
So don't jump to any conclusions yet.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.200
Fedora though really is a community driven project too.

23:47.200 --> 23:50.680
So you could still get in on the conversation and help direct where this goes.

23:50.680 --> 23:55.560
Now he writes, I expect that over the next year or so Fedora Atomic Host will be replaced

23:55.560 --> 24:00.080
by a new thing combining the best of Container Linux and Project Atomic.

24:00.080 --> 24:05.600
This new thing will be called Fedora Core OS and serve as the upstream to Red Hat Core

24:05.600 --> 24:06.800
OS.

24:06.800 --> 24:07.840
That's a lot to take in.

24:07.840 --> 24:10.560
I've invited Matthew Miller to come on Linux Unplugged this week.

24:10.560 --> 24:13.240
He's got a super busy schedule, as you can probably imagine.

24:13.240 --> 24:17.960
But if it can work out, I'll try to get it from the horse's mouth, no offense Matthew,

24:17.960 --> 24:21.240
to try to understand what's really going on here because it sounds like a major shift

24:21.240 --> 24:26.280
for Fedora, but one that the project is kind of architected to take on so it has a chance

24:26.280 --> 24:27.280
to work out.

24:27.280 --> 24:31.380
And the key aspect you mentioned there was the community involvement.

24:31.380 --> 24:36.800
It's early enough in this whole process that the community can get involved, can help shape

24:36.800 --> 24:42.160
this thing, and potentially even shape the direction that Red Hat's going to take Red

24:42.160 --> 24:43.160
Hat Core OS.

24:43.160 --> 24:47.680
It seems like it's really early days, so it's all still in the works, but it could make

24:47.680 --> 24:52.400
Fedora really stand out as a uniquely differentiated Linux distribution.

24:52.400 --> 24:56.080
Not that it isn't already, but this is a clear differentiator, so I'm kind of excited to

24:56.080 --> 24:57.600
see where they go with it.

24:57.600 --> 25:01.240
In the meantime, we do have some data for you Ubuntu users.

25:01.240 --> 25:05.080
You recall the new survey that was baked into Ubuntu 18.04.

25:05.080 --> 25:08.480
Well Canonical has done the first round of publishing the results.

25:08.480 --> 25:12.240
And very interesting results they are too.

25:12.240 --> 25:16.920
Some of them are pretty kind of what you'd expect, like stuff like people only having

25:16.920 --> 25:21.600
one GPU mostly and one display mostly.

25:21.600 --> 25:27.440
But one thing I was quite surprised about was that 1080p is the most popular display

25:27.440 --> 25:28.440
resolution.

25:28.440 --> 25:29.440
Yeah, 1080p.

25:29.440 --> 25:34.480
We finally reached above that low res netbook graphic size that we were hanging out for

25:34.480 --> 25:35.780
so many years.

25:35.780 --> 25:40.980
But the thing that you don't seem disappointed in, I kind of am, is one monitor?

25:40.980 --> 25:42.720
Everybody knows the more monitors the better.

25:42.720 --> 25:44.360
I'm a little disappointed in that.

25:44.360 --> 25:47.400
Yeah, it's not a battle station if you've only got one monitor, right?

25:47.400 --> 25:51.960
Yeah, it's just way better with at least two regular monitors and one vertical monitor

25:51.960 --> 25:52.960
from personal experience.

25:52.960 --> 25:57.280
So come on everybody, you got to jump in on that bandwagon so that way distro maintainers

25:57.280 --> 25:59.280
are encouraged to support it more.

25:59.280 --> 26:04.560
The thing that jumped out at me is 15% of people installing Ubuntu 18.04 already are

26:04.560 --> 26:06.800
using the new minimal install option.

26:06.800 --> 26:09.920
That's a pretty high adoption rate for a brand new feature.

26:09.920 --> 26:15.040
75% did a fresh install while 25% did an upgrade.

26:15.040 --> 26:21.500
I would bet you that number will climb after 18.04.01 comes out or 18.04.1 comes out because

26:21.500 --> 26:25.760
that's when existing 16.04 users are going to get the prompt upgrade.

26:25.760 --> 26:30.760
The 16.04 desktop users haven't even gotten that like, hey, it's time to go.

26:30.760 --> 26:37.920
Also as a little disappointed, just going to say it right now, eight gigs of RAM is

26:37.920 --> 26:39.400
the most common.

26:39.400 --> 26:40.400
Really people?

26:40.400 --> 26:45.680
Four gigs was more common than eight gig, just slightly, which that didn't surprise

26:45.680 --> 26:52.120
me because most laptops, most cheaper laptops that you've bought in the last, I don't know,

26:52.120 --> 26:57.480
four or five years have come with four gigabytes, but yeah, eight is actually slightly lower

26:57.480 --> 26:58.480
than that.

26:58.480 --> 27:03.320
But it's interesting that at least a couple of people had 128 gigs of RAM.

27:03.320 --> 27:05.120
That must be some serious workstations.

27:05.120 --> 27:06.840
Oh yeah, that's awesome.

27:06.840 --> 27:09.480
Yeah, because remember these are all desktop installs.

27:09.480 --> 27:17.840
Also speaking of the survey itself, a pretty strong 67% opt-in rate to take the survey.

27:17.840 --> 27:18.840
That's pretty good.

27:18.840 --> 27:22.040
And that's just within the last few weeks, 67% of people.

27:22.040 --> 27:26.940
Yeah, although I do somewhat feel in the minority here because 90% of people download updates

27:26.940 --> 27:27.940
during the installer.

27:27.940 --> 27:31.000
I never do that because I had one bad experience one time.

27:31.000 --> 27:34.220
Half the people use the restricted add-ons, I never bothered with that.

27:34.220 --> 27:39.800
And only about, well, under a third of people use auto login, which I always do.

27:39.800 --> 27:42.200
So I feel like I'm out in the cold here.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.760
Except for the codecs, I'm on the same.

27:44.760 --> 27:49.400
I had a one time bad experience with downloading updates that made the install take forever

27:49.400 --> 27:51.000
and eventually hang.

27:51.000 --> 27:55.800
So I filed my bug, I did, and then I've never used it since.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.840
And I installed the codecs every time.

27:57.840 --> 28:03.160
And on all of my studio systems, I set up auto logins, which is the majority of my installs.

28:03.160 --> 28:08.680
But the one key bit of data that we don't have yet is how many of these installs are

28:08.680 --> 28:09.680
there.

28:09.680 --> 28:13.040
That's the one thing they didn't publish, and they haven't published the raw data yet.

28:13.040 --> 28:15.520
Will talks about wanting to do that as soon as possible.

28:15.520 --> 28:21.840
But with all this GDPR stuff and general data protection concerns, you can see why they've

28:21.840 --> 28:25.080
just put some percentages out there for now.

28:25.080 --> 28:29.040
And they must be being very, very careful about what data they're actually going to

28:29.040 --> 28:30.040
release.

28:30.040 --> 28:35.360
And they did tell us that the US has the biggest Ubuntu user base, followed by Brazil, India,

28:35.360 --> 28:36.360
China, and Russia.

28:36.360 --> 28:39.560
Well, that's kind of the populations of the world, really, isn't it?

28:39.560 --> 28:41.200
It's not a massive surprise.

28:41.200 --> 28:45.400
And if you look at the graph, I think you said every single country in the world, there

28:45.400 --> 28:46.400
are Ubuntu users.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.800
So that tells you something.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.640
I wonder how many distros could say that.

28:49.640 --> 28:54.940
Yeah, we have the data linked in the show notes, as well as It's Foss did an infographic

28:54.940 --> 28:57.480
of all of this, which, hey, look at that.

28:57.480 --> 29:00.980
We got an infographic about something, Joe, and we'll put a link to that in the show notes

29:00.980 --> 29:01.980
as well.

29:01.980 --> 29:05.040
Well, I look forward to quizzing Will a little bit more about this on Late Night Linux that

29:05.040 --> 29:06.040
we record tomorrow night.

29:06.040 --> 29:09.500
So yeah, check that out, and hopefully we'll get some more info.

29:09.500 --> 29:13.760
And I do want to know when we're getting the raw data, because so many people want that.

29:13.760 --> 29:17.140
Yeah, and we'll cover it when it happens, as well as all the other stories in Linux

29:17.140 --> 29:18.360
and the open source world.
