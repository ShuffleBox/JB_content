00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,160
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 253, recorded on August 10th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,160
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,160
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,160
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,240
We start this week with a question we know is on the minds of all of you out there.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,840
What's the latest with Microsoft's Linux distribution?

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,760
It was just over a year ago that the world was shocked to learn Microsoft had been working

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,080
on CBL Mariner.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,400
And not only have they been issuing steady updates, but they've also been extending its

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,240
capabilities.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:44,600
And Microsoft has been issuing one or sometimes even more updates per month.

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,520
And this week, it marked the release of CBL Mariner 2.0, the July 2022 update too.

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,880
So I take that to mean they had two updates in one month.

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,160
And it seems that the release itself, well, there's a lot in there.

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,440
But one of the things that caught our attention is more and more packages are being added

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,340
that make the distribution at least somewhat practical to run on bare metal now.

18
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,480
Now we should note that this all still appears to be very use case specific.

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,240
So no, don't expect a desktop spin anytime soon.

20
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,080
They've also added some other useful packages though, like FIO and SysBench for performance

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:31,800
testing, KubeVert, libXF, kernel tools, and a bunch of other ones I definitely do use.

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,000
This newest revision to CBL Mariner 2.0 also adds a few more packages to its subset of

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,080
Fedora RPMs, network configuration support for unattended ISO installs, that's handy.

24
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,680
And it brings Linux 5.15 LTS to the mix among a bunch of other fixes and improvements.

25
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,220
Any adventurist among you out there can actually go find an ISO link from the GitHub Readme

26
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,120
page which we will have in the notes.

27
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,520
But I can't help wonder, how far does this go?

28
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,640
It starts to get bare metal support over time, starts to get more and more package support,

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,160
more and more scripting for unattended installations.

30
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
How far does this go?

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,320
And I think the second question that I feel in all of this is, and I'd love to hear the

32
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,320
audience's input on this.

33
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,220
So dear listener, how do you think the Linux community is going to process this information

34
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,960
about CBL Mariner and process the information around its continued growth as they push it

35
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
forward?

36
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,800
Go to linuxactionnews.com slash contact to let me know or send a boost into the show

37
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:36,080
with a new podcast app.

38
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,240
Security issues around the free software supply chain have become a popular topic of discussion

39
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,640
lately.

40
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,400
At the core of the concern is how we verify the many different free libraries and components

41
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,360
that modern application stacks depend on.

42
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,200
The Microsoft-owned GitHub announced on Monday that it plans to support code signing for

43
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,740
npm software packages using the code signing platform Sigstore.

44
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:04,720
That tool grew out of a collaboration with multiple tech companies to make it much easier

45
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,960
for open source maintainers to verify that the source code they create is the same code

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,400
that ends up in the software packages actually being downloaded and used by end users worldwide.

47
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,100
Those multiple tech companies include the likes of the Linux Foundation, Google, Red

48
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,680
Hat, Purdue University, and Chain Guard.

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,120
There's also been some significant adoption of Sigstore by the likes of Kubernetes, and

50
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,300
there's even an official tool for signing Python packages using Sigstore these days.

51
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,520
Of course, with any tool like this that requires additional work, Sigstore relies on being

52
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:46,920
free and easy to use to spur adoption and to get people to actually use it.

53
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,360
GitHub says it's starting with a proposal on how Sigstore will be implemented for npm,

54
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:57,100
and then also having an open comment period to get feedback from the community on exactly

55
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,120
how the tool will be deployed.

56
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,340
And on the topic of GitHub, also on Monday, the source code for an open source Ethereum

57
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,400
privacy mixer called Tornado Cache was completely removed from GitHub, prompting outcry from

58
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,640
privacy and free speech advocates alike.

59
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,880
This all happened after the US Treasury Department added the Tornado Cache website and a long

60
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,940
list of Ethereum addresses to its specially designated nationals list, banning American

61
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,160
citizens from using the tool or transacting with those addresses.

62
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,680
If you're not familiar, Tornado Cache is an app that lets users make private transactions

63
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,800
on the Ethereum network.

64
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,800
It does this by pooling together Ethereum deposited by many different users and mixing

65
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,960
them together so those transactions are obscured.

66
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,820
Within hours of the announcement by the Treasury Department, reports started to emerge that

67
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,880
GitHub had taken action, shutting down both the Tornado Cache project page, but also the

68
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,260
developer's entire GitHub account.

69
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:04,820
The developer then took to Twitter, asking, is it now illegal to write open source code?

70
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:10,940
For their part, GitHub says they had no choice but to act, though that response certainly

71
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,700
has provoked a general outcry from several industry leaders, who cited the 1996 federal

72
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:23,640
court case Bernstein v. U.S., which established source code as speech, protected by the First

73
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,780
Amendment.

74
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,300
And Matthew Green, a cryptography professor at Johns Hopkins University, said, quote,

75
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,620
30 years of hard legal work to establish First Amendment protections around software distribution,

76
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,020
blown up in a day by GitHub and Microsoft.

77
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:44,220
In response to clarification on the situation, a GitHub spokesperson said, quote, trade laws

78
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,180
require GitHub to restrict users and customers identified as specially designated nationals

79
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,940
or other denied or blocked parties.

80
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:57,260
Or that may be using GitHub on behalf of blocked parties.

81
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,100
It's an understandable tough position for Microsoft and GitHub.

82
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,780
Notable though, the U.S. Treasury sanctions on Tornado Cache do not name the Tornado Cache

83
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,900
developer or anyone involved with the project.

84
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,540
In fact, the only identifying information in there is Tornado Cache, the project, the

85
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,260
name, and some Ethereum addresses.

86
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:21,540
There is no individuals listed at all.

87
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,100
A tricky situation to be sure.

88
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,980
We're just glad there are still viable self-hosting alternatives that are out there.

89
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:35,100
But sticking with GitHub for one last story, many of us became aware of a privacy policy

90
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,460
reversal after a staffer tweeted about the issue.

91
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,660
Yeah, on December 17th, GitHub published a blog post promising not to use non-essential

92
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,340
cookies out of concern for user privacy.

93
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,300
But a week ago, that blog post got an update with an asterisk signifying that the privacy

94
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,100
policy had changed.

95
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,780
It seems that for GitHub enterprise marketing subdomains, non-essential cookies are back

96
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,380
on the menu with the reason being just quite simply, quote, better reach and to improve

97
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,520
the web experience for enterprise users.

98
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,620
If you're not comfortable with that change, well, there is a 30-day comment period.

99
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:19,900
You can find it at linuxactionnews.com slash 253.

100
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,660
Well after all of that, we kind of feel like covering something like good news from the

101
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,180
decentralization file on the show.

102
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,180
And that's IPFS, the Interplanetary File System, which is a protocol for peer-to-peer decentralized

103
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,740
file sharing, has now been baked into FFmpeg starting with version 5.1.

104
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,140
And it appears the effort is not stopping with FFmpeg.

105
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:46,380
That IPFS support actually landed in FFmpeg back in July.

106
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:52,040
But Mark Geiser, an OpenGrant participant turned Protocol Labs contractor recently blogged

107
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:57,620
about the FFmpeg IPFS implementation, sharing some more juicy details that we could really

108
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,940
sink our teeth into.

109
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:06,420
The utility of having a fully decentralized file protocol built right into FFmpeg, that

110
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,500
just seems pretty obvious to me.

111
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,780
And it seems like the inspiration for the idea actually came from a failed drive in

112
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,980
Mark's home server.

113
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,600
He wrote in the blog post, quote, after days of debugging, I just couldn't resolve the

114
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,540
issue which sparked a simple idea.

115
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:27,540
I already use IPFS, why can't I use that to play my media?

116
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:33,340
Good idea Mark, in multiple ways, because by building that support into FFmpeg, not

117
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:39,380
only does anyone using FFmpeg directly benefit, but so do a huge amount of downstream projects

118
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,620
that also make use of FFmpeg.

119
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,620
But oh no, Mark did not stop there.

120
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,980
He's also begun adding support to VLC, MPV, and Kodi.

121
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,340
That MPV support in particular, looks like it could be finished up by the next release.

122
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,940
For details on how to play around with this new support in FFmpeg, and the grants that

123
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,460
are making all of this possible, well you should check out Mark's full post, we will

124
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:11,940
have a link to that as well.

125
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:20,740
Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS was scheduled for release earlier this week, but that's been pushed

126
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:27,220
back by an additional week, after a bug was found that led to Snaps like Firefox failing

127
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,220
to launch.

128
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:36,060
Now, if you've already upgraded to Ubuntu 22.04.1 via apt upgrades, don't worry, this

129
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,220
bug actually only affects new OEM installs.

130
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:45,500
As for the bug itself, well that was found in the final hours before release.

131
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,760
Thankfully though, as we record right now, the fix has been completed and it's on track

132
00:09:50,760 --> 00:10:12,540
for that new release window.

133
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:21,940
That's Linode, right there, with real humans that are available to help you 365 days a

134
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,940
year.

135
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,300
Linode is how we run everything we've built in the last few years in the cloud, and like

136
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,260
us, Linode loves Linux, and that stuff matters to me.

137
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:35,500
As a business owner, I want to patronize other businesses that support the Linux ecosystem,

138
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
and Linode does.

139
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,780
They provide support for projects, they invest in open source, and they also invest in the

140
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,780
community.

141
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,740
Linode is sending us down to California in September to meet up with a whole bunch of

142
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,220
you and get to take a tour of JPL, and Linode doesn't do that because they're going to make

143
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,860
a ton of money on it, although hopefully they'll get some of you to sign up as a show of support,

144
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,860
but they do it as an investment in the community because they're long-term thinkers.

145
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,500
I mean, they've been doing this for nearly 19 years, so they've really figured out how

146
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,960
to do this right, and because they are Linux enthusiasts themselves, they get that connection

147
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,060
to the community like no other provider does.

148
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,180
And of course, it doesn't hurt that they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers that

149
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,700
want to lock into their esoteric crazy platforms with their own unique languages and names

150
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,580
for everything where they forked a bunch of projects and call them something completely

151
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,580
different now.

152
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,580
You know what I'm talking about.

153
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,420
That's not Linode's game.

154
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,020
Linode's game is simple, affordable, accessible cloud hosting.

155
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,380
Their game is the best place to run applications on Linux.

156
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,380
They've recently rolled out MVME storage, AMD EPYC processors.

157
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,380
They are their own ISP, and with 11 data centers around the world, you'll find something close

158
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,900
to you that's nice and fast.

159
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,900
It's so nice.

160
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,300
It really is, because honestly, I wouldn't want to host my stuff anywhere else.

161
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,820
I'm really happy to say that we are proud Linode users, and I think you're going to

162
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:55,820
love it too.

163
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,060
And you know, they just recently updated their Kali Linux support, so they added Kali Linux

164
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,560
support, and then a new version of Kali came out, and they've already updated the version

165
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
of Kali that they now let you run.

166
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,620
It's pretty convenient, and it's a great way to remotely audit your network.

167
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,340
So go try Linode, learn something, support the show, maybe deploy something.

168
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,620
Try it for yourself, try it for your business.

169
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,980
Just go to linode.com slash lan.

170
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:23,940
One more time, that's linode.com slash lan for that 60 days, $100 credit on your new

171
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,940
account.

172
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:31,260
Linode.com slash L-A-N.

173
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,660
And a big thank you to Kaliide.

174
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,780
Kaliide.com slash lan.

175
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,780
Kaliide is an endpoint security solution that uses the most powerful, untapped resource

176
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,260
in IT.

177
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,260
And users.

178
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,900
And when you're trying to achieve security goals, maybe it's for yourself or a third

179
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:50,460
party audit, maybe it's just for the boss, the wisdom of yesterday was to treat every

180
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:55,040
device like it's Fort Knox, with old school device management tools and MDMs that force

181
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:00,860
disruptive agents onto employees' devices, slow down performance, and gunk them up.

182
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,200
I never wanted that stuff on my machine.

183
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,340
It really turns IT admins and end users into enemies.

184
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:13,460
And not to mention those tools often create their own security problems.

185
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,980
So it was time for something different.

186
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,260
And that's why it's great to introduce you to Kaliide.

187
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,780
They do things better.

188
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:26,220
Instead of forcing changes on users, Kaliide sends them security recommendations via Slack.

189
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,820
And Kaliide will automatically notify your team when the device becomes insecure.

190
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,780
And it'll give that person step-by-step instructions on how to solve the problem.

191
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:40,140
And by reaching out to employees via a friendly Slack DM, and then educating them about policies,

192
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:46,000
well, Kaliide helps you build a culture in which everyone contributes to security.

193
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,300
Because everyone understands how and why to do it.

194
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,620
And for IT admins, Kaliide provides a single dashboard that lets you monitor the security

195
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,060
of your entire fleet.

196
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,580
Maybe they're on a Mac, maybe they're on Windows, and even when they're on Linux.

197
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:05,460
You can see at a glance which employees have their disks encrypted, their OS up to date,

198
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,300
and a password manager installed, making it easy to prove compliance with your auditors,

199
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,160
your customers, and leadership.

200
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
So that's Kaliide.

201
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,700
User-centered, cross-platform, endpoint security for teams that Slack.

202
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,660
You can meet your compliance goals by putting users first.

203
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,620
Visit Kaliide.com slash LAN to find out how.

204
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,700
If you follow that link, go there, they'll hook you up with a goody bag, including a

205
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,820
free t-shirt just for activating a free trial.

206
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,580
You know I love that free swag.

207
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:43,980
So go get it, it's Kaliide.com slash LAN, that's K-O-L-I-D-E dot com slash L-A-N.

208
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,860
You'd be forgiven for thinking you missed the announcement this week of the next Linux

209
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:54,220
kernel officially getting the 6.0 major version number.

210
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:59,020
After all, there seems to even be some confusion about that on the Linux kernel mailing list

211
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,740
right now.

212
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,100
You might just say that excitement is building for this next release, but we don't actually

213
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,100
know yet.

214
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,580
There's no official announcement.

215
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,700
Probably only Linus really knows if we're going to get 6.0 or 5.20 for the next kernel

216
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,700
release.

217
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,720
Historically, Linus has bumped the major number around the dot 19 release, but he sometimes

218
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,020
does it for the dot 20 release.

219
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,220
For example, Linux 4.0 came after Linux 3.19.

220
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:31,060
But just to send us a little bit of a curveball or keep things inconsistent, we did see Linux

221
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:34,740
4.20 before we got Linux 5.

222
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,300
So you never really know.

223
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
Why does it matter?

224
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:43,500
Well, simply put, Linux is probably the most important operating system in the world.

225
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,100
And at least I think there's something remarkable about how unremarkable a major decision like

226
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,740
this is being made.

227
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,020
I think to the outside observer, it probably seems a little haphazard.

228
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,860
Yeah, I can understand that position.

229
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,980
I mean, version numbers mean different things to different people, different projects, and

230
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,780
maybe whether something is considered a library or an application or in this case, an operating

231
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,780
system.

232
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,220
Don't know quite where that falls.

233
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,700
But I think you should read this and take some hints from both Linus's policies around

234
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,480
not making breaking changes, at least for user space.

235
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,620
And then also as you say it, the sort of haphazard nature.

236
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,740
A Linux kernel version, it just doesn't really mean much.

237
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,500
I've started to think of them kind of like the arbitrary release numbers that seem to

238
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,020
be popular with browsers these days.

239
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,660
I totally see that comparison.

240
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,760
I agree for all of the minor releases, and I think most people don't even think about

241
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,240
what version of the kernel they have on their distribution.

242
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,500
The version that the distribution ships with is probably very rarely a deciding factor

243
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,060
on what distro they're going to use.

244
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,860
I mean, it is for me, but I doubt for most people, I don't think it's something users

245
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,420
care about much.

246
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:03,520
However, 6.0, right, those big point releases, that's going to get coverage.

247
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,780
That's going to get attention.

248
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,020
That's going to get buzz.

249
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:12,500
And you know, I think strategically, it might be a good idea to do it because there is a

250
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,220
lot of great features in this release that probably should get some attention.

251
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,500
I mean, just super quick.

252
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,220
Some of my personal favorites, again, we're going to see real time kernel support possibly

253
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,220
land.

254
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,300
One of my favorite file systems, XFS, is getting improvements from multi-core CPU systems,

255
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,020
which is like all my systems.

256
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,220
ButterFS, my other favorite file system, it's getting version two of stream support, major

257
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,300
new features in IOU ring, which people are excited about.

258
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:44,420
And finally, the Raspberry Pi 4 GPU kernel driver is landing.

259
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,900
Love all of that.

260
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:52,260
Yeah, I like those too, but that's just scratching the surface with whatever this new kernel

261
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,260
is going to get called.

262
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,820
I mean, we've mentioned that Rust support is expected to land.

263
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:02,540
There are also a ton of improvements and new hardware support for both AMD and Intel, and

264
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,620
even some good news for Clevo hardware users out there.

265
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:11,780
Enterprise users will also benefit from some plumbing being done for Compute Express Link,

266
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,860
and there are some changes that should greatly improve NFS.

267
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,300
I just can't see them not trying to get some attention on this release, and I think people

268
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,820
listening will say, oh, Linus doesn't care about that stuff.

269
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:24,820
Wrong you are, I say.

270
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,380
I've observed this man for a long time, and I think he does think about this stuff a little

271
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,380
bit.

272
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:36,020
They have pride in the Linux kernel, and they have pride in their work, and they like to

273
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,460
go after narratives about the kernel getting too old or slow or too big.

274
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,220
That's all part of this, and either way, we're just super happy to see this continue to get

275
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,220
work done.

276
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,340
I mean, there's so many things landing in this next release that we could dedicate a

277
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,940
week's worth of shows to it.

278
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,860
Even our favorite feature, the new Samba server that's built into the kernel, even that is

279
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,060
going to see some improvements.

280
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:01,220
Long live KSMBD, I say.

281
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,740
How dare you.

282
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,860
As for when we might actually get our hands on that new kernel, well, there is a process

283
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,180
to follow.

284
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,220
The merge window, which is the time during which contributors can send in requests for

285
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,060
their new code to be integrated, that's currently open.

286
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:20,660
Once that closes will come a period of testing and integration work marked by a series of

287
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,660
release candidates.

288
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,060
Then, if all that goes well, we'll finally get to find out what new version we're working

289
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,060
with.

290
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,100
And either way, we'll be happy.

291
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,540
I went back just kind of historically to the archives in preparation for this segment,

292
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,700
and I read all of the release announcements between major version bumps, you know, 3.19

293
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:45,580
to 4, 4 to 5, and just read all of them and really is a capture.

294
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:49,580
It's like a time capsule of what's going on in the community at that time.

295
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,340
And some releases, you could tell things were kind of stressful.

296
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,740
And in fact, one of them, Greg even writes in there in part four line, it's just everybody

297
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:03,220
take a week off after this release, go have a week off, walk away from the computer.

298
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,260
That's not the sense.

299
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,140
I get with this release.

300
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,940
There's a lot of new stuff in here and a lot of excitement.

301
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:13,600
And the Colonel really seems to be firing on all cylinders this release cycle.

302
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,900
And every single day, Wes and I are seeing a new story, a new announcement about something

303
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,620
landing in the Colonel about some work being done about some improvement.

304
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:30,460
There is just a level of development, I think, looking back at those archives that we didn't

305
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,220
know where we'd be at back then.

306
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,740
We weren't sure if it would be able to continue.

307
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,500
There was a lot of talk if the development was sustainable in the Colonel.

308
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
And here we are.

309
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,380
And it's firing all cylinders are doing great.

310
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,740
We'll have a link to some good resources in the show notes for all of that stuff, including

311
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,420
a really good write up about the new user space block driver that's going to work with

312
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,880
IOU ring over on lwn.net.

313
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,660
So if you're into that stuff, that's definitely worth a read.

314
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:57,700
But either way, we're going to follow the development and all this stuff pretty closely

315
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,540
and we'll report back to you what ships, when it ships, what you need to know about.

316
