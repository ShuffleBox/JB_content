00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,720
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 144, recorded on February 8th, 2020.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,720
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,720
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,720
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,720
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,880
So we start today with an update that we've eagerly been waiting for.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,960
This is the end of life announcement for CoreOS container Linux.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,600
And we finally got some documentation telling people how to migrate over to Fedora CoreOS.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,600
Right.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,840
As we've previously covered on the show, Fedora CoreOS is the official successor to CoreOS

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,840
container Linux.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,840
Fedora CoreOS is a new Fedora edition that's built specifically for running containerized

13
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,820
workloads at scale.

14
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:46,380
There's certain features that CoreOS container Linux had, like automatic updates, etcd technology.

15
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:52,040
They're combining that with some of the core technologies of Atomic Host, like the SELinux

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:01:00,000
security model, the packaging system, OCI support, and creating a new distribution.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,640
It's not much of a direct migration, unfortunately.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,760
In fact, they write, beware that Fedora CoreOS cannot currently replace container Linux for

19
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,200
all use cases, including it does not yet have native support for Azure, DigitalOcean, Vagrant,

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,720
or many of the other platforms where container Linux was very popular.

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,120
It's popular in DigitalOcean in particular.

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:29,000
And Fedora CoreOS takes what they call a best effort at stability, but they may occasionally

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,960
include regressions or breaking changes for some use cases or workloads.

24
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,400
And that was not the case with CoreOS's version of container Linux.

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,360
It was very much meant for production grade systems.

26
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,160
So it's not a perfect solution here.

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,340
There is a fork, obviously, of the previous CoreOS container Linux, but this is not great.

28
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,640
And it's not a great look either, in my opinion.

29
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,760
Yeah, I agree.

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,860
It's not a great look.

31
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,160
It's funny that they say you may want to consider flat car container Linux, which is the fork.

32
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,760
But they also just casually drop in or, you know, Red Hat OpenShift, which includes RHEL

33
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,600
CoreOS if you want to pay us a bunch of money.

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,320
Yeah, I'm left to conclude there must not have been a lot of CoreOS container Linux

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,320
users.

36
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,960
In a sense, they'd be treading more lightly here if this was affecting millions of installs.

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,800
This is likely, I would imagine, in the low tens of thousands potentially, maybe even

38
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
less.

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,080
It's a very aggressive timeline, though.

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,360
Effective immediately, CoreOS container Linux is no longer available on the AWS marketplace.

41
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,360
Think about that.

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,800
In the past, if a Linux distro goes away, you can generally still find the ISO somewhere.

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,960
But in the cloud world, they can just remove it from the marketplace.

44
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,780
Let's say it's a much more dramatic death of a distribution.

45
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,840
On May 26, final updates to CoreOS container Linux roll out.

46
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,240
Any bugs, any vulnerabilities after that will not get fixed.

47
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,040
And then some big dates land.

48
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,480
On or after September 1, all of the published resources related to CoreOS container Linux

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,040
will be made read-only, like GitHub, repos, things like that, issue trackers.

50
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
And you're done.

51
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,840
So you have September essentially as your very last day to run before you need to migrate

52
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
to something else.

53
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
It's fairly aggressive.

54
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
Yeah.

55
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,280
And you really ought to have migrated long before that.

56
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,120
Imagine if you've built a load of scripts and everything that can interact with the

57
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,640
API for AWS, and suddenly they're just worthless because there's no image available anymore.

58
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Yeah.

59
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Or entire workflows.

60
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,200
I just look at this and I think, okay, we must be talking about a small set of thousands

61
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,640
of users.

62
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,360
And the team looked at it and said, we've only got so much resources to go around.

63
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,520
We've got to build this new platform and get it as stable and viable for people that are

64
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,480
migrating as possible.

65
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,000
And the longer we maintain the old system, the less we can do that.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,280
They have less resources to go around if they're split between CoreOS container Linux and the

67
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,840
new Fedora container Linux.

68
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,460
There's just only so many people and so much man hours.

69
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,600
And I can appreciate the tough spot, especially when you're talking not millions of users

70
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,600
here.

71
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,880
You're talking maybe 5,000, 10,000, maybe 15,000 users.

72
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Who knows, right?

73
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,320
It's a small number, I'm assuming.

74
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,920
And you don't want to do what looks bad, but at the same time, you've got to do what will

75
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,680
make the future project successful.

76
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,700
It was almost two years right around now as we record this, January 30th, 2018, the Red

77
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,240
Hat announced it was acquiring CoreOS.

78
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,760
And January 31st, 2018, everyone, including you and I, was asking, well, what are you

79
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,300
going to do with the overlap between Atomic and CoreOS container Linux?

80
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,160
And I guess I just hoped after two years, the answer would be a little more flushed

81
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
out.

82
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,240
Well, the only conclusion I can draw from this is that they must have had a small number

83
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
of users.

84
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,200
Otherwise, they would have cared more about this and put more resources into this and

85
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,400
made the transition a little bit easier.

86
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,180
Well, there's a small number of new users that can get their hands on Google's Enterprise

87
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,120
Edition of Glass now.

88
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,480
Yeah, this was a pretty low key post this week on the Google Developers blog, just casually

89
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,720
saying that the Glass Enterprise Edition 2 is now available for any developer who wants

90
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,400
it through one of our resellers.

91
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,020
That's literally it.

92
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,840
It's essentially technically like a four paragraph PR release.

93
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,880
But when you dig in here, what they're saying is there's three new distributors that anybody

94
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:27,640
that really is motivated can go to now to get their hands on Glass, which is the new

95
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,420
refined edition that is more targeted at enterprise applications, which is how they really focus

96
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,420
it.

97
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,960
They write in here, Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2 has helped people working in logistics,

98
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,920
manufacturing, field services, and a variety of other industries to do their job more effectively.

99
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,600
And then they stress that it uses Android, and it's easy to work with.

100
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,920
And then you can integrate with your existing services and APIs because Android.

101
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,920
Yeah, and for this relatively low end hardware with no expensive screen and a smallish battery,

102
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,680
you're going to be paying just over $1,000 bargain.

103
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,560
I know it does seem like a lot of money, but then I was kind of contemplating if Apple

104
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,160
or Samsung or somebody else were to get into this game, I could see their glasses being

105
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,560
even more expensive for some augmented reality solution.

106
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,040
There is an open source story to this update as well.

107
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,040
It's again, kind of buried in this really low key blog post, but they have a batch of

108
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:29,000
code samples that they've open sourced to write apps that make it essentially crazy

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,720
easy for a business to go grab these, tweak them a little bit.

110
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,020
And now they've got enterprise glasses apps.

111
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,040
This whole world, it seems silly to me.

112
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,960
However, if I had to look under the hood of an engine for something to fix, I'd totally

113
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,000
like something like this.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,080
Even if it was an app on my phone, I'd love to be able to point it at my engine and have

115
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,880
it tell me everything in there and describe everything and replacement item numbers.

116
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,960
And I mean, if these things could get really smart where some average guy like me could

117
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,760
pop a hood and get an idea of, you know, here's my transmission fluid cap.

118
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
What's the right transmission fluid?

119
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,240
And it just looks at that and says, okay, well you've got a golf 2018.

120
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,160
It takes this kind of transmission fluid, boop, boop, boop, but you put it right here

121
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,340
and it puts a little box around it for me.

122
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,600
I'd love something like that.

123
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,240
I don't know if I want glasses because I think the frequency in which I would use it would

124
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,000
be so rare that something on my phone would do fine.

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,800
I could see it for companies where you're doing that kind of stuff all day though.

126
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,560
I had the exact same situation yesterday.

127
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,360
I was in an unfamiliar car that I'd borrowed and I needed to put some petrol in it, gasoline

128
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,480
as you would say.

129
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,200
And so I get to the petrol station and I get out and I can't open the flap thing.

130
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,920
And I'm like, what?

131
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,520
It took me, I'm not joking, 10 minutes to think about it.

132
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,780
Well, maybe five minutes and I had to Google how to do it.

133
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,560
And then it turned out that there was this little flap thing that I had to pull.

134
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,260
Whereas my one on my old car, you just literally pull it open.

135
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,480
Whereas if I'd had some sort of augmented reality app that I could just either on glasses

136
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,760
or on my phone, look around the car and then it would show me what all the buttons did

137
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,420
or whatever, then it would have been much, much quicker.

138
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,760
And you're right, for consumers, that doesn't make sense.

139
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,940
An app on your phone makes way more sense than having a pair of glasses.

140
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,340
So if you're doing that all day, every day as part of manufacturing and you need to have

141
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,460
various data, it makes a lot of sense to have glasses.

142
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,880
So I think that they're probably going to have to get the price down for it to really

143
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,760
succeed in enterprise and compete with the others.

144
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,380
But I can see this living on.

145
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,040
It seems to be that Google project that you think is dead, but just keeps on trucking

146
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
somehow.

147
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,100
Yeah, there must be some use out there.

148
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:49,660
And I think about this kind of the same way I think about home smart tubes in that I think

149
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,760
people who are skeptical of the Echos and the Google Home products, well, I mean, besides

150
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,980
their security implications, but people that just don't see the point at all, I can walk

151
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,980
to the light switch.

152
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,820
I don't need to talk to a tube.

153
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,820
Those people?

154
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,820
Like me.

155
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,820
Yeah.

156
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:09,940
What you don't realize until you use one is there is a lot of utility in having access

157
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,740
to some form of computing while your hands are busy or you're full, you're there full,

158
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,020
you're carrying something or you're inside working on something and you can just yell

159
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,540
at something and have it do something.

160
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,620
It's really useful.

161
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,340
The hands free nature of it when you're coming through the front door and you can turn some

162
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,280
lights on or turn a heater on or you can turn on a coffee pot or I don't know.

163
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,300
In the case of manufacturing, it would be probably turn on or off a sensor or something

164
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,980
like that and you could be working on it while you have this information in front of your

165
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,900
face without ever having to actually touch the device.

166
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,680
You can always keep your hands dirty.

167
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,860
They can be covered in something.

168
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,540
You can be working on something.

169
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,420
We don't really appreciate how useful that is until you've used it a few times and you

170
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,980
get that effect with the smart tubes.

171
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,060
I think it'd be tenfold with something that was beaming visuals directly into your retina

172
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,060
constantly.

173
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,660
Do you remember in the 90s you had that Bluetooth guy, you know, the Bluetooth headset guy and

174
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:10,180
that was just a complete joke and no one would seriously want to do that and you'd have to

175
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,420
be that guy to do it and it was in comedy sketches and everything.

176
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:19,260
And then fast forward to here we are in 2020 and AirPods are a fashion accessory and they're

177
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,300
basically a Bluetooth headset.

178
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,280
So could it be that eventually people get used to the idea of having some augmented

179
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,660
reality glasses and it does become a consumer product?

180
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,660
Yes.

181
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,420
I see it already happening all the time.

182
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:40,780
And several companies, more than several, are making AirPod competitors that have smart

183
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,540
assistants built in.

184
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:49,380
One of the things that the new AirPods Pro feature is the ability to do passive audio.

185
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,660
So they use the microphones on the things and they EQ it slightly to cut out some of

186
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,300
the lows I think.

187
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,740
So they pass audio in but it's augmented audio.

188
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,740
It's been EQ'd.

189
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,800
It's not just flat audio coming into your ears and so it's a small form of enhanced

190
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,200
audio and then you have, of course, the Siri assistant and you can squeeze them and it

191
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,580
silences the whole world and you can have these things, you can be walking around and

192
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,940
you don't hear the rest of the world.

193
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,180
And to me it's both freaky.

194
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,380
I just recently went kind of on a side rant somewhere else about this.

195
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,860
It's freaky because these things are selling at such a rate that there's an obvious market

196
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:33,480
demand for them but yet we have nothing from the free software community that really also

197
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,460
provides that same functionality.

198
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,620
When you also then connect all of these back to services like Google Glass will require,

199
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:45,380
which is also proprietary, restrictive and often spying on its users and we have nothing

200
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,780
in the free software community like these things, it really bothers me.

201
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,940
And I think the Apple Watch, AirPods, Google Glass, Fitbits, they all kind of fall into

202
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,460
this category where I'm looking around going, oh, I hope we have something that is actually

203
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:01,300
really appealing to the market soon.

204
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:05,940
Well, it'll probably take eyeglasses with an eye and glasses.

205
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,060
See the hilarious pun there from Apple.

206
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,060
I reckon that's what it'll take to make this popular and then maybe there'll be some sort

207
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,220
of free software equivalent.

208
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,300
That's why all of this makes me think about our Mycroft story this week.

209
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,420
It's maybe more important than ever and they've been targeted by a patent troll.

210
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,740
Yeah, Mycroft published a post on their blog this week about what they're calling their

211
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,580
first patent troll and this is a company in Texas who wrote them a highly confidential

212
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,780
letter offering to license the valuable patents to Mycroft.

213
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,660
And their approach to this is they're not going to pay, they're going to take it all

214
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,660
the way in court.

215
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,860
Yeah, they say as a result, they developed a new internal policy that reads quite simply

216
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,220
quote, we're going to litigate every single patent suit to the fullest extent possible,

217
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:57,380
including appealing any adverse decisions all the way up to the Supreme Court, end quote.

218
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,380
This is nice.

219
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,500
I like seeing somebody get fired up and go to the mat about these things, but then I

220
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,380
started reflecting on this and I thought the technology landscape is a patent minefield,

221
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:13,020
but these AI assistants, these personal assistants, these assistants that tie in with ecosystems

222
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:19,620
that do voice recognition, that speak back, that must be a patent land mine.

223
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,420
Mycroft needs to fight this because as soon as they get any kind of large user adoption,

224
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,440
I bet the trolls will come out in herds.

225
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,500
I never know which way I would go if I was hit with this because on the one hand, you're

226
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
right.

227
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
They need to stand up.

228
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:40,740
They need to say we're not going to take this, otherwise everyone else would pile on, but

229
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:46,420
court cases and lawsuits, they cost an awful lot of money and they can ruin businesses.

230
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,380
It is a precarious situation they're entering.

231
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,700
I think that might be one of the reasons why it's important that we all share it and we

232
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,740
spread the word and we make sure that they get some awareness for this.

233
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,100
I could see a potential fundraiser in the future.

234
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,020
I wouldn't be too surprised.

235
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,940
I think it's pretty great to see Mycroft doing something like this, to be honest with you.

236
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,820
So I hope they get the recognition they deserve.

237
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,820
Yeah.

238
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,300
Fingers crossed that they can come out of this in a positive position.

239
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,660
I'm not massively hopeful for them, but I do wish them the best.

240
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,480
That's why I thought it was worth mentioning.

241
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,020
What might just be our most fascinating story this week, though, is a joint announcement

242
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,580
from the Goodnew Project Leadership and the Free Software Foundation.

243
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:31,020
This is a very short announcement, but it says that their mutual aim is to work together

244
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:36,560
as peers while minimizing change in the practical aspects of this cooperation so that we can

245
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,620
advance our common free software mission.

246
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,760
That is a bit complicated to fully unpack, although I think I follow what it means.

247
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,340
But the timing of all of this seems very suspect to me.

248
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,620
And that's where the interesting thing comes in because certain individuals within the

249
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,760
Goodnew Project are currently drafting a social contract for that project.

250
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,140
And that social contract is in draft stage.

251
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,440
It's got a little more time left in the oven.

252
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,160
And then around the end of February, it's going to go into effect.

253
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,980
And I note that they are urging folks to send in their opinions on this structure that they're

254
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,660
announcing because they plan to finish the framework soon and want to be done by February

255
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,660
13th.

256
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,220
Yeah, I first became aware of this Goodnew social contract when Carlos O'Donnell proposed

257
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,740
it on the Goodnew Misc Discuss mailing list.

258
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,100
Yeah, same.

259
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,240
Carlos is the team leader, Red Hat, for the Goodnew C library, which he's also responsible

260
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,220
for all of the uses within the Red Hat enterprise line of products.

261
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,500
He's also the official FSF steward and core developer of the Goodnew C library project.

262
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,580
So an important figure within the project and at Red Hat, and he writes, I've been working

263
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,460
with several other Goodnew maintainers and volunteers to draft a Goodnew social contract,

264
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,340
which explains the key commitments we want from the Goodnew Project.

265
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:59,820
The draft is being designed from the ground up by the Goodnew volunteers and for Goodnew

266
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,340
Project volunteers.

267
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,340
Is it official?

268
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,100
It's official to me and I'll follow it.

269
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:10,340
We have asked for feedback by February 9th to be incorporated in the update draft by

270
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,900
February 10th.

271
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,180
We've asked for endorsement by current Goodnew maintainers on or before February 24th.

272
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:23,420
So you see how the timing is working out almost perfect with the announcement from Goodnew

273
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,220
and the FSF.

274
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,500
There's obviously some overlap here.

275
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:34,620
As you'd expect, when a social contract is proposed, it's met with a lot of controversy.

276
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,620
So I read it.

277
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,660
I read the entire social contract.

278
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,220
It's essentially one, two, three, four, five paragraphs, very short ones.

279
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,940
It starts by outlining that they respect the four essential freedoms, which you've heard

280
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,940
before if you've ever heard RMS list them out for you.

281
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,700
It also lays out that the Goodnew Project adopts policies that encourage and enable

282
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,740
developers to actively defend user freedom.

283
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,140
In fact, the only part that seems to really have gotten everyone outraged is the part

284
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,660
that says they just want to include everyone.

285
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,500
They say regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, level of experience, any

286
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,900
other personal characteristics, but long time members and not everyone, but some of some

287
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:18,280
examples in the show notes seem to believe that this is essentially a takeover.

288
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:24,780
What's happening here is a coup to put in new leadership and quote, the feature of the

289
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:30,180
Goodnew Project is that it has no social contract and quote, and that the belief is a lack of

290
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:36,340
a social contract is what has made the project successful and made it truly open to all contributors.

291
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,100
I think some within the project essentially see this as a power vacuum type crap, while

292
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:47,820
others in the project see this as a way to tell the outside world, these are our core

293
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,700
ideals and if they don't align with you, you're probably not a great contributor and if they

294
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,360
do align with you, you're probably a great fit for our project.

295
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,900
And I'll tell you something, when I read that social contract, it was probably the most

296
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,380
direct clarification of the Goodnew Project and how they see themselves fitting in in

297
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,180
the overall free software ecosystem that I've ever seen from them.

298
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,440
That social contract, if you just read it as an introduction to the Goodnew Project

299
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,440
is fantastic.

300
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,700
In fact, it doesn't even read as any kind of contract.

301
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,260
It's a great clarification of what the Goodnew Project is and they should put it on their

302
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,540
front page, but it has been met with that resistance that does seem to be a split in

303
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,540
the project.

304
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,180
Not everyone's on board with this.

305
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:34,980
I agree, but that seems to be potentially the core story behind this mutual cooperation

306
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,580
update that's been announced with this really tight timeline.

307
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,100
I get the feeling this isn't going to be the last we'll hear of this.

308
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,380
I think over the next week or two, we're going to be hearing an awful lot more.

309
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,940
Well, a couple of other things we're watching right now is some fundraisers in the community.

310
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,060
Yeah, the first one's for the family of Mark Greaves, who was the lead developer of Peppermint

311
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,060
OS.

312
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,660
Yeah, we mentioned that recently on the show.

313
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:01,500
Mark left behind two kids and a wife and I think there's something sort of poetic about

314
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,140
maybe his passion project that took a little bit of time from the family could help make

315
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,020
this transition easier for the family.

316
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,300
So we'll have a link to the GoFundMe in the show notes.

317
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,860
And on a happier note, we have some great news from the folks at Elementary OS.

318
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:19,260
Yeah, they have an IndieGoGo campaign that they're calling App Center for Everyone.

319
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,620
And I put this in kind of thinking that we'd help them out, but they're already at 81%

320
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,620
of their goals.

321
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,500
So I think they're doing okay.

322
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,580
I'd love to see them smash it.

323
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,780
To be honest, the project could use the funding.

324
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,500
There's four things they're going for with this IndieGoGo campaign, which is really to

325
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,940
get them all together in an in person one week sprint.

326
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,180
Number one, they want to improve the privacy and security and stability of the App Center

327
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,400
and the apps that get distributed, sandboxing, things like that.

328
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,700
And I think out of this four here, streamlining the payment process is nice, but it's really

329
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,080
number four, expanding the market for Apps Center apps by making them easily available

330
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,340
on other Linux based operating systems, i.e. making the backend payment technology something

331
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:03,660
that works with Flatpak and is available for developers across all distributions, making

332
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:10,100
a simple, easy way that's part of a development process to charge for Linux apps that's worked

333
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,980
really well on Elementary OS.

334
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,540
That could have some potential and it seems to be drawing in the funding.

335
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:20,820
I must say my first reaction to this was crowdfunding a company sprint.

336
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,460
That's unusual.

337
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,220
That's not how most people do it.

338
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,500
But then I thought more about it and I thought, well, Elementary OS is a project and a company

339
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,980
that does things differently in the desktop Linux space.

340
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:38,060
They're never afraid to charge money for things and raise money and do things a little bit

341
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,060
differently.

342
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,100
So I think fair play to them, really.

343
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,540
It's clearly very popular and they're almost at their goal with only a couple of days of

344
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,260
social media promotion.

345
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:53,580
So I can see this smashing way beyond the 10,000 and they said that they will invest

346
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,140
that money in Elementary OS and App Center through contractors.

347
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,420
I talked to Dan about it and I take his word at that.

348
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,780
I'm going to have Dan and Cassidy on Tuesday's Linux Unplugged.

349
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:07,420
I've got some questions for them to get a few clarifications.

350
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,420
But I think people get it.

351
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:13,620
I think they read their user base accurately on this.

352
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,860
People understand that when you bring the lead developers of a project together in one

353
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,340
room for a week, great things happen for the end users.

354
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,660
It has really good knock on effects.

355
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,140
And Elementary OS has already demonstrated that in the past.

356
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,820
And so they've kind of shown a record of delivering on it when the users step up.

357
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,980
And I do like this approach.

358
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:36,740
I would like to see them make even more money at it because I think the project could use

359
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,900
better funding still.

360
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,700
But I am not even a primary user.

361
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,140
I have family that uses Elementary OS and I backed it.

362
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,140
I'll tell you, at the end of the day, I think it was the donuts and the picture with the

363
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,700
mug that really got me.

364
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,820
And that cool hoodie that they've got, that seems to be very popular.

365
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,980
I might have to ask Dan for one of those privately when we next record User Error.

366
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,420
That would be so unfair.

367
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,660
I paid hard money for my mug.

368
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,140
Do check out User Error.

369
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,260
Episode 84 was fantastic.

370
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,900
UserError.show slash 84.

371
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,180
And then once you've listened to those, go back and listen to the last few.

372
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,300
But you can just start with the latest one and then be sure to subscribe to us at linuxactionnews.com

375
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,020
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

376
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,780
I'm at Chris LAS.

377
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,540
