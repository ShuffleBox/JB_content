00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,080
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 160, recorded on October 25th, 2020.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,080
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,080
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,080
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,600
It's good to be connected with you on your final episode of Linux Action News.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,560
Yeah, Wes is taking over next week, but I'll be back at the end of the year for a predictions

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,560
episode.

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,240
I've got to beat you at that one last time.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,600
And we've got a big batch of news this week to send you off to, so a lot to get into.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,200
So let's start with Ubuntu 2010 released.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:34,480
Now this is just an interim release, so it's not an LTS, a long term support.

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,720
So it's only going to be supported for nine months.

13
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,400
So you don't expect to see too much great in there.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,240
And for me, not much has changed.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,460
I think a sure sign that not much has changed is when Joey's article at OMG Ubuntu includes

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,840
new wallpapers on the list of features.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,760
Hey, I know some of those in corporate life will be happy to see Active Directory support

18
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,660
landing in the installer.

19
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,280
And some folks out there with newer hardware will appreciate Linux 5.8.

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,320
But I think the headline feature here with 2010 groovy gorilla is the Raspberry Pi four

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,620
desktop support.

22
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,320
Of course, previous versions of Ubuntu were officially supported on the Raspberry Pi,

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,000
but only the server additions.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,600
This is the first release that has got official desktop support.

25
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,440
Yeah, and that means you get the GNOME desktop version of Ubuntu on a Raspberry Pi four.

26
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,360
Now you need to have either a four gigabyte or eight gigabyte model to pull this off.

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,320
But with this, you essentially have the entire suite, the family of Ubuntu's available for

28
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,240
the Raspberry Pi from the server stuff, which has gotten even better with 2010.

29
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,320
I don't know many folks will be running 2010 as a server.

30
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,800
But if you are running disposable edge infrastructure, there's a lot to like about 2010.

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,520
And its support for Raspberry Pi's means you could have on demand edge devices running

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,040
on ARM.

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,080
That's pretty compelling.

34
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,320
But you could see where this is going long term, Joe, this is going to eventually all

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,240
roll into the next LTS release, which is still a bit off, still a ways down the road from

36
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,240
now.

37
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
But you got to get these things lined up.

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,960
And I think this is where Canonical is being really clever, because I don't know who is

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:12,440
really chomping at the bit today to have the Ubuntu GNOME desktop on Raspberry Pi four,

40
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,240
but it's there, and they're supporting it.

41
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,120
And as a company, they're aligning behind it.

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,200
In fact, Mark Shulderworth's statement seems to really indicate a deep commitment.

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,600
They say in this release, we celebrate the Raspberry Pi's foundation to commitment to

44
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:27,600
put open computing in the hands of people all over the world.

45
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,720
We're honored to support this initiative by optimizing Ubuntu on the Raspberry Pi, whether

46
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,320
it's for personal use, educational purposes, or as the foundations of their next business

47
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,320
venture.

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,760
This is Canonical preparing for a platform that I think has a lot of legs still.

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,520
We're only just beginning to see the Raspberry Pi foundation's hardware capabilities.

50
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,080
And the Raspberry Pi four is already pretty impressive.

51
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,680
But imagine, like I've been saying for a while, what the Pi five is going to bring in the

52
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,120
Pi six, and what else they might be working on.

53
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,600
And I think it's really clever for Canonical to align the company behind this and prepare

54
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,080
for that future.

55
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,320
And you do that today by getting an interim release up and running on the desktop.

56
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,400
Yeah, this is the perfect time to have your first desktop release on the Pi, because it's

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,780
an interim, and it's the first interim after the LTS.

58
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,480
So they've got 18 months now until 2204 comes out.

59
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,920
And that's plenty of time to iron out the issues.

60
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,680
I was a little bit skeptical that GNOME was going to perform well on the Raspberry Pi,

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,120
even the four.

62
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,040
And I think this release has vindicated my skepticism, because it does feel a lot slower

63
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,040
and just generally more sluggish than Raspberry Pi OS, which is not a huge surprise, because

64
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,840
the Raspberry Pi Foundation have been making that disk drive for a long time.

65
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,280
They've had a lot of time to iron out any issues with it.

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,680
And it's also an LXDE desktop, which is inherently lighter than GNOME.

67
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,680
Right.

68
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,160
And I think you'd have a similar experience with Mate versus GNOME on the Raspberry Pi

69
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,160
four.

70
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,480
Mate is going to perform better, just like XFCE will.

71
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,440
And this is not, I think, what is driving the decision here.

72
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,760
Canonical is perfectly aware of this performance difference.

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,920
I think it's really about getting the team, about getting the resources and staffing in

74
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,720
place to enable this complete port of Ubuntu to this platform.

75
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,400
So it's not just the server.

76
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,880
It can be the entire legitimate Ubuntu desktop.

77
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,520
And you start now.

78
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,800
And yeah, you're absolutely going to win the performance argument every day of the week

79
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,600
right now with the Raspberry Pi four.

80
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,960
You're going to have a better experience with LXDE or LXCUTE or XFCE on this hardware.

81
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,080
Just no doubt about it.

82
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,040
But it's damn impressive that GNOME Shell is in good enough shape and the Raspberry

83
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,280
Pi four is fast enough that you can actually do it like that, first of all, is surprising

84
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,280
to me.

85
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,480
And second of all, like I've said a couple of times now, you can see where it's going

86
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,280
to go in a few more iterations of the Pi.

87
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
It's going to be just fine.

88
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,240
And imagine if you're building yourself a desktop around the Pi four.

89
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,880
It's kind of nice to even have Canonical doing this because you know now that if Ubuntu is

90
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,840
your distro of choice, your hardware platform is being taken seriously by them.

91
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,840
I don't know if you've seen it, but you can get Pi cases now that have legitimate cooling.

92
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,280
They put all the ports on the back.

93
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,600
You hook it right up and you can have a mouse and keyboard hooked up to a monitor and it's

94
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,600
usable.

95
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,720
I don't know if I'd do it with GNOME Shell, though, but I could see where it's going to

96
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
get there.

97
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,160
Yeah, I think over the next 18 months it will get there and hopefully I'll be proven wrong

98
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,160
and GNOME will be optimized enough to run on it.

99
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,140
And it's all about the hardware acceleration and getting all that tweaked perfectly.

100
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,200
This is a good start, but it's not really daily driver ready just yet, I don't think.

101
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,500
Yeah, I think you're probably right.

102
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,480
I agree with the light experimenting that I did.

103
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,600
However, I tip my hat because I think they're betting that this platform is going places

104
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,920
and there's more to come.

105
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,840
I think it's a smart bet.

106
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,120
Well if you want to run Windows on your Chromebook, Parallels Desktop for Chromebook Enterprise

107
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,160
is out.

108
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,120
This was announced back in June, but here we are actually seeing it come to fruition.

109
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,800
And for $69.99 per year per user, plus the Windows license, you can have a full Windows

110
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,840
10 desktop within Chrome OS, but only if you are an Enterprise customer.

111
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,360
That's part of the big sell here, isn't it?

112
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,440
Is that it can be managed and deployed from your standard Chrome management suites, fully

113
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,740
ready to go with Windows.

114
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,480
You can deploy it to a Chromebook remotely and then the user double clicks one icon and

115
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,800
the thing's up and going.

116
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,640
And they're really selling hard on the integration with the OS, the mouse cursor, the copy paste

117
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,760
support, and then kind of trying to close the deal by talking about how great it will

118
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,160
be for you to run Microsoft Office on your Google Chromebook.

119
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,420
And that really tells us who's driving this, is there must be a customer that wants Microsoft

120
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:47,160
Office, not the cloud version now, the full Windows version on the desktop.

121
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,600
And they also want a Chromebook.

122
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Well think about it.

123
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,640
That's the one solution to rule them all now, potentially.

124
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:58,880
You can buy a high end Chromebook and it has to have at least an i5 or i7 and 16 gigabytes

125
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,060
of RAM and 128 gigabytes of storage.

126
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:09,280
But then you've got a machine that can run Chrome OS and be updated and have the best

127
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,080
bits about Linux.

128
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,080
You can run a complete version of Windows 10.

129
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,320
You've got all the Android apps and you've got proper Linux support via Debian VM.

130
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,320
Yep.

131
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,480
And you get all of the benefits of a simple Chromebook for the users who don't need this.

132
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,720
So you could buy these machines for your school, for your business, deploy them and manage

133
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,000
them with the Google admin console, which is pretty tight and pretty well done.

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,400
And then for the handful of users that need the extras that are only available in local

135
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,560
office, you deploy this with some single clicks.

136
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,960
Well, I'm sure it's more than that, but that's how they pitch it.

137
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,880
And they actually do mention in here some of the things that users might want that aren't

138
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,640
in the full version of Office, funny enough.

139
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,900
If you want trend lines, you have to have full Excel.

140
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,840
If you want tables in Word, you've got to have full Word.

141
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,280
If you want custom fonts or headers or footers in PowerPoint, well, you've got to have full

142
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,160
PowerPoint and that's who they're targeting this at.

143
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,840
Maybe you have a shop that has several hundred users and maybe only 30 of them need this

144
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,560
Windows VM and the rest can all be totally plugged into the Google ecosystem and have

145
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
everything they need.

146
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,040
Meanwhile, as a business, every four or five years, you're buying them like $1,000 Chromebook.

147
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
I could see it.

148
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,640
I see it maybe a little more in education, but I guess I can kind of get it.

149
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,600
It seems like a funny way to go about it when you have things like remote desktop as an

150
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:35,800
option, but I guess if you're offline, you want something fully local, this is probably

151
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
the best way to go.

152
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,360
Well, especially as people are working more from home these days where internet connections

153
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,040
can be a bit ropey, having a full offline version of Windows that you can still work

154
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,200
on your documents while your internet's down for a couple of hours is a pretty good sell

155
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,780
for a Chromebook which, at least when they started, were completely cloud connected and

156
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,040
internet connection dependent.

157
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,280
I feel like you're talking about me there a little bit.

158
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
Yeah, that's true.

159
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,320
I hadn't even thought of you where, yeah, sometimes you go off into the woods and have

160
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,040
got no internet for a couple of days even.

161
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,800
But we talked about Ubuntu at the beginning of the show and that is a great distribution

162
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,600
to use on the desktop and it's doing well.

163
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,000
But for the mainstream crowd, this is how Linux on the desktop wins.

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,480
Some of our community doesn't necessarily like it that Chrome OS is a massively popular

165
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,520
Linux desktop, but it is and you can't really argue with that.

166
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:35,600
And so a combination of Chrome OS, Windows subsystem for Linux, and proper distros like

167
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,720
Ubuntu are how we have won on the desktop with Linux.

168
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,160
It's just not kind of how people imagined it would be.

169
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,720
I think that kind of sums up how life is these days, Joe.

170
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,800
Just not how we thought it would be, but it is what it is.

171
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,000
System76.com, we've been talking about them recently and now they've made some big news

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,020
with the Thaleo Mega.

173
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,960
It's the world's smallest quad GPU workstation made for deep learning and scientific computing,

174
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,840
although I suspect you could game with it too.

175
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,240
And it has the same beautiful design, that Thaleo look, but even in a smaller compact

176
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
unit now.

177
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,360
So go to System76.com and check out the Thaleo Mega, run it through the configurator and

178
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,440
see how you can build this just the way you like it.

179
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,840
You can go up to 256 gigabytes of quad channel RAM.

180
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,280
You can put four GPUs, super high end GPUs if you want.

181
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:34,880
And that's why System76 took great care to make sure the airflow in the Mega is top notch.

182
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,960
It's way beyond industry standard stuff here.

183
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,540
Everything down to the GPU brace developed to secure the GPUs for transit has been designed

184
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,340
for maximum thermal efficiency.

185
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,460
And just like the previous units, the Mega is open source hardware, which is up on GitHub.

186
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,480
It's handcrafted and manufactured right there in Denver, Colorado.

187
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,200
They're designed and built in the US.

188
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,320
So check them out, System76.com.

189
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,920
And if you get something, tell them Linux Action News sent you.

190
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,720
One of the biggest controversies of the week was YouTube DL being removed from GitHub thanks

191
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,480
to a DMCA request by the RIAA.

192
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:15,320
Yeah, the RIAA is the Recording Industry Association of America, and they have utilized

193
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,580
a DMCA takedown request, Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

194
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,560
It is the oldest trick in the book, but what is different this time is the takedown request

195
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,040
was based on entries in YouTube DL's source code.

196
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,860
So let that sink in for a moment.

197
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,460
Now they're going through and scanning potential copyright violations in open source source

198
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,960
code up on GitHub.

199
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,720
And I actually think it was part of a blitz, Joe.

200
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,840
I think it was 18 projects in total that were taken down around the time that YouTube DL

201
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
was taken down.

202
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:49,260
Generally speaking, previously, they've gone after organizations and people who are engaged

203
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,840
in copyright infringements directly.

204
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,760
Whereas the difference here is that they're going after a tool which can be used for copyright

205
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
infringement.

206
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,120
And that is a bit of a change of tactic by them.

207
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,760
Yeah, in a letter sent to GitHub, the RIAA argued that the clear purpose of the source

208
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,360
code was to circumvent the technological protection measures used to authorize streaming services

209
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,080
such as YouTube, and to allow users to reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings

210
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,640
without authorization.

211
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:24,080
Because obviously the only use for YouTube DL, which downloads and archives videos from

212
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,520
thousands of websites, obviously, the only use of that tool is music piracy.

213
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:37,120
Well, to be fair, in YouTube DL's examples, they use the URLs of videos like Taylor Swift

214
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,680
and Justin Timberlake, which was a little bit short sighted by the YouTube DL project.

215
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:49,880
They should have used some Creative Commons video maybe like Big Buck Bunny or something

216
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,800
rather than, hey, you can use this to download Shake It Off.

217
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Right.

218
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,040
They were likely scanning for the very URLs for those popular music videos, the RIAA was,

219
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,520
and they found it in source code on GitHub.

220
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:09,680
I am not comfortable with them scanning GitHub and issuing takedowns like this, but it's

221
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,680
come to my attention that this isn't totally uncommon behavior on the GitHub platform.

222
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,640
In fact, even open source projects like MB have used the DMCA takedown process on GitHub.

223
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:26,440
So it's not totally uncommon, but this idea that perhaps a violation could exist by linking

224
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,840
to a URL or suggesting people download a URL in one part of the source code or in one part

225
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,200
of the documentation shouldn't necessarily equal takedown the entire project immediately.

226
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,960
The developers of YouTube DL found out about this by trying to just work on their project.

227
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,380
In fact, I'll link to this in the show notes.

228
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,400
At first, because they were constantly living under fear of this, at first they just assumed

229
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,600
it was Google.

230
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,800
They just assumed it was Google that did the takedown because why wouldn't they come after

231
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:57,000
them for even just calling their project YouTube DL?

232
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,120
So they just naturally assumed that it was Google that caused it, and then they figured

233
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,640
out after they got access to the information that it was actually a takedown from the RIAA.

234
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,800
But imagine that use case.

235
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,200
You're a developer working on a worldwide famous project that is used to do all kinds

236
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,320
of things from live stream capturing to backing up videos that are just on a news website,

237
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
right?

238
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,840
It has potentially nothing to even do with YouTube, and all of a sudden you're going

239
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,840
to check in on this project and you get access denied, and you think, what's wrong with my

240
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
account?

241
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
What's wrong?

242
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,840
What's going on?

243
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
Has my password been changed?

244
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
Did somebody hack my account?

245
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
What's happening here?

246
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:40,280
And then you discover after the fact that your project is already down, it's already

247
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:46,280
offline, it has GitHub, or actually let's be honest, Microsoft, because it's Microsoft

248
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,360
who owns GitHub and they have to own the good and the bad here, Microsoft has taken a popular

249
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,200
well-known free software project offline without even notifying the developers.

250
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,200
I mean, they probably issued them some sort of automatic email that they missed, but there

251
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,320
was no due process here.

252
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,440
There was no chance for them to first contact the project and tell the project, hey, we've

253
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,880
received this complaint and they believe this violation has occurred.

254
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Would you like to respond?

255
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Boom.

256
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,880
Immediate action.

257
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
They shut it down.

258
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,680
And that is ridiculous.

259
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:20,640
This makes me worried because I use YouTube TL a fair bit here and there and what's going

260
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
to happen?

261
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:25,520
I've got this snap of it installed now, but that's probably not going to get any updates

262
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,100
unless this gets sorted out.

263
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,360
You would have thought that one of the forks will survive and we'll probably just have

264
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:37,520
to use that, but it's a dangerous precedent here going after open source tools.

265
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,920
What about, for example, New Pipe, the Android app that I use, which is totally open source.

266
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,280
I use that to watch YouTube videos on my phone.

267
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,240
Are they going to go after that now because you can download videos there?

268
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,300
We'll just have to wait and see.

269
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,560
If they decide to start targeting tools like this all the time, it's going to be a real

270
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
problem.

271
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,520
I bet every clip I've ever played in any Linux podcast from an open source event or speech

272
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:03,660
or conference or presentation was likely captured with YouTube TL.

273
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,400
And there was no issue.

274
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,400
It was Creative Commons.

275
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,160
It's a totally legitimate use of a tool here.

276
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,920
I often will save things offline to just watch later.

277
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,760
I'm a YouTube premium subscriber too, so I'm paying per month.

278
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,680
I don't get ads anyways.

279
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,260
I've never preferred to monetize the creators I watch by watching penny ads on YouTube for

280
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,260
shaving cream.

281
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:30,560
Instead, I just prefer to either monetize directly through Patreon or some other platform

282
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,960
or to at least do a YouTube Red subscription so then everybody wins.

283
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,880
In that case, in that use case, why can't I download the videos?

284
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,840
Why can't I watch them, especially if the creators are smart enough to come up with

285
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:48,460
a way to monetize directly and not rely on an arbitrary per bid advertising platform

286
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:53,040
that rewards the lowest brow content possible?

287
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,720
The argument here that you're using it to steal music videos seems ludicrous because

288
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,840
there's really no need to steal music videos anymore.

289
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,200
They're so plentiful.

290
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,760
They're so available online that there's really nothing driving, incentivizing you to do this

291
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,000
unless you are an archivist or you're storing it offline.

292
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,440
The use case here seems so niche.

293
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,220
It seems like such a minority of what this tool will be used for that it's silly that

294
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,480
that's what has framed the argument.

295
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,040
Surely, anyone who is smart enough to figure out how to use YouTube DL on the command line

296
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,600
is smart enough to install an ad blocker as well.

297
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:36,520
That argument of this is somehow denying these artists or record companies ad revenue seems

298
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,520
a bit spurious.

299
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:45,240
It's surely a tiny minority of people who are using tools like this to view the videos

300
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,480
rather than just the official app and seeing through the ads and skipping them when they're

301
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,400
allowed and stuff.

302
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,080
This just seems like the RIAA just trying to justify their existence.

303
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,240
Right, and they're hoping they can lean on this old horse here, but anybody who publishes

304
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,680
on YouTube can go look at their information on the sources, and you'll see most commonly

305
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
it's mobile.

306
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:13,300
That's going to be the top, and then you'll have web, and then there's other in there.

307
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,840
That's the category that YouTube DL will fall into.

308
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,800
For Jupyter broadcasting, which you have to figure has a probably higher than average

309
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,920
awareness of a tool like YouTube DL in that audience, it's like 3% of other, and that's

310
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,460
going to include things besides just YouTube DL, too.

311
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,160
That's going to include pretty much anything that's hitting the API to play that video

312
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,160
is counted as other.

313
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Amongst other things like Roku apps and set top boxes, YouTube DL is in that grouping,

314
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,320
and in a predominantly very technical community who is turned on to open source tools, it's

315
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,080
like a 3% group.

316
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
It's tiny.

317
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,640
You'd imagine the average Taylor Swift video has got to be less than 1%, probably less

318
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,040
than 0.1% people using YouTube DL.

319
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:08,160
This is really about the RIAA developing tools to scan through the source code of public

320
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,840
open source projects and then automating a process to go after them to shut them down.

321
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:19,900
They're using the revenue as a bit of a gaslight to make this okay, so that way there's not

322
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,760
a big negative reaction to this.

323
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,840
The RIAA, if you go back through history, has had a couple of really big public cases

324
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,140
that brought them some really bad PR.

325
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,220
That's actually why people hate the name so much.

326
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,120
When you say the name, it's got to be one of the worst brands in American history.

327
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,320
It's in part because of just a couple of really horrible public cases where they went after

328
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,440
a grandma for downloading music on Napster.

329
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,760
They know now that when they do something like this, they have to control the narrative.

330
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,020
They have to put something out there.

331
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,520
By saying that the clear purpose of this source code, remember this is their direct quote,

332
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,440
the clear purpose of this source code is to circumvent the technological protection measures

333
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,200
used by authorized streaming services such as YouTube.

334
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,520
That's what it's really about.

335
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,060
It's about going after the tool that could make this possible, even if they can't even

336
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,400
quantify the cost.

337
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,980
They had got to control this, they got to justify this kind of control, and that's how

338
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,040
they're doing it, is with the monetization angle.

339
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:22,760
Well, you can still download the binaries and a tar wall from their website, youtube-dl.org.

340
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,120
This hasn't even worked.

341
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,620
It does say that their dev repository is down, but downloads are still working.

342
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,800
This is really just a Streisand effect situation here.

343
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,080
Probably more people than ever have found out about this.

344
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,040
Technical people who otherwise didn't know about it will be using it.

345
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
Well done, RIAA.

346
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,280
Shot yourselves in the foot there.

347
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,440
If you're on Wi-Fi a lot, then why are you always paying for data?

348
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,620
Why not just pay for what you use?

349
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,760
That is what makes Ting special.

350
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,360
A fair price for however much you talk, text, and however much data you use.

351
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,320
And they have three nationwide networks for you to choose from, so rest assured Ting has

352
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,300
you covered coast to coast.

353
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,520
My latest device I activated with Ting, it's a Verizon device.

354
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,680
It's brilliant having them all under one control panel.

355
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,600
And speaking of control panel, you are always in control.

356
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,520
You can see your usage at a glance, you can set usage alerts, you can nickname accounts

357
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,920
so you know what account is using what, and let's talk devices.

358
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,280
They've got all of the devices, from iPhones to Androids, or bring your own.

359
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,880
You can go check out the Ting shop, just do me a favor and start at linux.ting.com.

360
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:33,160
That'll take $25 off a device, or if you bring a device, you go to linux.ting.com, they'll

361
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,280
give you $25 in service credit.

362
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,680
Now your average Ting bill, $23, $24 a month.

363
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,360
So if you go to linux.ting.com, that'll cover your first month of Ting.

364
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,560
So go check it out, linux.ting.com.

365
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,680
We have to mention Microsoft Edge arriving for Linux.

366
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,720
It's only in preview, and you did talk about it on Linux Unplugged, but we couldn't let

367
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,720
this one go by.

368
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,720
This is a pretty big deal.

369
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,620
Yeah, this preview officially supports Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and OpenSUSE.

370
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,960
Nothing out there for the Pi yet.

371
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,440
They're looking at ARM, Microsoft says.

372
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,240
I've tried it on Fedora, and I've tried it on Ubuntu.

373
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,680
And I guess I liked it better than I thought I would.

374
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,160
You know, it's still lacking a few critical features for me to actually seriously use

375
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
it.

376
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:21,500
But this last go-around, when 2010 came out and Fedora 33 is about to come out, I decided

377
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,380
to try those distros with Firefox and Edge.

378
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:29,720
And it kind of reminded me of the early days of Chrome.

379
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,760
Remember when Chrome first launched, it was all about being lean and mean and fast?

380
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,680
That was what Chrome's whole pitch was?

381
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,680
That's kind of Edge.

382
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,920
It's lean and mean.

383
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,840
And it's also Chrome.

384
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,360
And it has good fonts.

385
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,800
The fonts, to my eye, are some of the best-looking fonts on a Linux web browser.

386
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,440
Well, I tried this briefly.

387
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,920
And all I can say is it's a fine browser, I suppose.

388
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,620
I just don't have any motivation to use it.

389
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:01,640
When I've got Firefox as my main browser, and I've got Chrome installed for a few websites

390
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,460
that need it, I just don't have any motivation here to use this.

391
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,840
And so it was only on a test machine.

392
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,920
I used it for a good couple of hours, but there was nothing compelling enough about

393
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,400
it to make me make the change.

394
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,960
I think it's really about developers coming to where developers are at and giving them

395
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,080
tooling so that way they can test their projects under Edge.

396
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,160
And those aspects of it there are actually looking kind of solid.

397
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,680
There's also things that are missing, like sync.

398
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,080
So if you want to sync across multiple machines, there's nothing there for you just yet.

399
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
They're still new to this.

400
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,100
I mean, they only got Edge out for Windows not so long ago.

401
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,720
And then they released it for the Mac in January of 2020.

402
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,100
And now here we are in the fall of 2020.

403
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,800
And it's landing for Linux.

404
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,560
I got a lot of feedback from people after we did this show where we were kind of like,

405
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,680
hmm, hmm, I don't get this, hmm, I don't know about this.

406
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,740
A lot of people know about it.

407
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:59,120
They wrote me and said, yeah, I'm in corporate situation Y, or I'm working on project X,

408
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,920
or I need it because of reason Z.

409
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,520
And it made me realize that there's already a lot of people waiting for this.

410
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,760
You wouldn't think so.

411
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,640
You wouldn't think a Microsoft browser on Linux would be something people are anticipating.

412
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,140
But just based on the feedback alone I got, I know some people are.

413
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,460
And now that I have used it, I think it's a perfectly fine browser.

414
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,600
And I think it pushes forward on fonts on the desktop Linux, which is surprising to

415
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,660
me, but it's there.

416
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,320
And I think it's worth taking a look at.

417
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,800
I don't think this is going to be many people's primary browser.

418
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,560
But I think there'll be a lot of people who have it installed for testing and for the

419
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:40,360
odd thing that needs it and for compliance reasons or whatever.

420
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,600
So I think it will find its audience on Linux.

421
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,320
I don't think it will be huge, but I think Microsoft must have calculated that it is

422
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,160
worth the investment to make it happen on Linux.

423
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,280
Whether or not that will be a long-term commitment, I suppose it depends how many people try it

424
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,760
out and use it.

425
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,560
And they must be inheriting some of the multi-platform benefit from Lync.

426
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,120
That has to give them a lot of what it takes to get it over to Linux.

427
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,160
And then they just have to close the gap.

428
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:14,040
So I could see that as long as the upstream project continues to support Linux, Microsoft

429
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,560
will continue to release on Linux.

430
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,860
I don't think we can have this conversation about Edge without acknowledging that there

431
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:24,720
is a generous portion in our audience that will be concerned about metric collection.

432
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,460
They're going to be concerned about Microsoft spying on them.

433
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,160
And it's not really an area we can speak fully to yet because a beta has additional levels

434
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,320
of collection and metrics that may not be in a final version.

435
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,600
But I am waiting for that inventive blogger to come up with a scenario to capture all

436
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,160
Edge traffic for a week and parse out what is actually going back to Microsoft.

437
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,600
It does ask you when you launch the browser, it runs you through like a first-time wizard

438
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
kind of thing.

439
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,280
And one of the things it asks you is if you want to collect details and metrics.

440
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,040
I actually said yes.

441
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,440
I'm not really using it a lot.

442
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,440
I'm only going to use it for a couple of weeks.

443
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,000
And in a way, I see that as a vote that somebody is running this on Linux.

444
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:09,220
By allowing them to collect my system information, whatever that might be, even if it's semi-identifiable,

445
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,440
what I feel like the tradeoff is is I'm voting in a sense with my wallet here.

446
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,320
I'm saying I'm a Linux user and I'm an active Linux user who's downloaded your project and

447
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
is running it.

448
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,200
And I don't know a better way to send that signal than allowing them to collect the beta

449
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,260
metrics for now.

450
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,640
So I left it on, but I don't know what I would do long term.

451
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,080
That's an area where I obviously just have a lot more comfort with Firefox.

452
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,800
Yeah, you're saying, hey, Microsoft, I'm using this on Linux and here's my social security

453
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
number.

454
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,880
And here's my phone number, my address, and my mother's maiden.

455
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,640
Yeah, it feels like you're doing that.

456
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,880
Who really knows what you're sending?

457
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,400
So I actually would love some transparency there.

458
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,920
They've got a couple of things in here besides fonts, too, that are nice.

459
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,200
They have pretty good integration with the Linux desktop.

460
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,200
You can right click on the launcher icons and launch multiple instances or launch a

461
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,760
private window like you can with full fledged Chrome.

462
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:06,000
And then Microsoft has added this concept of collections, which is bookmarks, but with

463
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,760
all of the content for the website, not just the links that saves in the browser.

464
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,580
That's actually something I find compelling because there's a lot of times we're doing

465
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,020
research for a show and a story changes.

466
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,200
And I like having the original version and the updated version because not everybody

467
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,760
actually clarifies that they updated.

468
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,460
And with collections, I just try to suck down all the information in store and I'm an archivist

469
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,460
in that regard.

470
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,080
And it also is nice to have our offline purposes later.

471
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,400
Linode.com slash land.

472
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,800
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account.

473
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,080
You know, Linode started in 2003 as one of the world's first companies in cloud computing.

474
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,080
I've known about them forever, but it was only a couple of years ago I decided to actually

475
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,560
give Linode a try.

476
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,920
They are independently owned and founded on a love for Linux.

477
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,960
And that became immediately obvious to me.

478
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,040
As a longtime Linux user, it shows in various aspects of how a company operates and how

479
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,600
they build their products.

480
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,680
And they've supported initiatives like Kubuntu and Linux Fest Northwest and all things open

481
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,080
for a long time.

482
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,360
But importantly, Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing.

483
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,440
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

484
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,140
They have fantastic fast internet connections.

485
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,960
They have a great dashboard that makes it easy to manage all kinds of things like your

486
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
DNS.

487
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,200
On top of various servers you can choose from, say like a $5 a month shared hosting or dedicated

488
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,380
CPU or GPU rigs.

489
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:28,120
They also have object storage, and they have all kinds of tools you can use to manage these

490
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,120
systems to like support for Terraform or Kubernetes and object storage, which is a great way to

491
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,360
store files in the cloud statically and link to them publicly.

492
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,400
So check out Linode.com slash land.

493
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,760
You get a $100 60 day credit.

494
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,420
You can set it up for a personal server or portfolio or you can run your company infrastructure.

495
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,640
And they're going to cost 35 to 50% less than AWS.

496
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,040
And they started three years before AWS.

497
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
So go check them out.

498
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
Linode.com slash land.

499
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:59,800
Well, we couldn't end my last episode any other way than with a cryptocurrency story.

500
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,360
And I think this is a pretty big one.

501
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:09,640
PayPal are going to support buying and selling and holding Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies.

502
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:13,820
This has got to be the biggest Bitcoin news since the last time we talked about Bitcoin.

503
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:17,200
The value of Bitcoin has shot up significantly as we record right now.

504
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,160
It's 13,000 U.S. greenbacks, which is a big jump up because it was like below 10 not too

505
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,620
long ago.

506
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:29,320
This is both extremely frustrating and great to see.

507
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,080
I was an early crypto coin enthusiast.

508
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,560
I think I can claim that, right?

509
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,680
I can make that claim.

510
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,680
I was into crypto early.

511
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,120
Yeah, I think so.

512
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,760
And back then, Joe, back in my day, PayPal was an enemy of the crypto community.

513
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,020
They were hostile towards small businesses that were trying to start up and base business

514
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,380
around the blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

515
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,580
They actively sought to shut them down.

516
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:55,440
They were anti-competitive and it seemed like such a short sighted move because they were

517
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,000
out of all of our quote unquote financial institutions in the U.S.

518
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,800
They seem like the best positioned to go after cryptocurrency.

519
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,160
It just seemed obvious because they could even if they just use it as a back end technology

520
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:14,280
to actually facilitate the transactions because PayPal is a company that's mostly working

521
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,960
with soft money where people could go and they could cancel a credit card payment and

522
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,500
then PayPal screwed.

523
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,760
So it just seemed natural to me that they would want to adopt something that was blockchain

524
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,720
based that they could account for and had no take backs.

525
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,900
But they fought it and they fought it until they could fight it no longer.

526
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:35,680
And now they've announced that they will have early support, I think you could say, early

527
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,680
support.

528
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,480
And this eventually will extend down to even like payment services like Venmo.

529
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,540
So it will have ramifications that reach across the industry, but it's not everything you'd

530
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,540
hope for.

531
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah, they're doing it in a very PayPal way.

532
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,560
If you dig into what they've written about this, they have kind of an FAQ.

533
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,480
Will PayPal support peer to peer crypto trades?

534
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,000
Not at this time.

535
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,920
PayPal only supports the purchase and sale of cryptocurrency using your PayPal account.

536
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:08,040
To complete peer to peer transactions with PayPal, all crypto assets held with PayPal

537
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:12,420
must be sold and thus converted into USD.

538
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,720
So it's not even really properly supporting it.

539
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:22,160
Yeah, you'll essentially only hold cryptocurrencies that you buy on PayPal in your PayPal account.

540
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,760
And you won't be able to even transfer that to another PayPal account and you won't be

541
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,200
able to pay merchants with that balance either.

542
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
That's how it's going to be at first.

543
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,720
But you have to figure to get any value out of this, they're going to have to change that

544
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,720
down the line.

545
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
Right.

546
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,560
I think the limitations are an indication of where they are going to attempt to extract

547
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,880
that value out of the chain.

548
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,720
So when you transfer or when you buy something with Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency,

549
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,080
they're going to get their cut.

550
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,680
If you read that FAQ that you mentioned, and we'll have a good article that actually sums

551
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:58,780
all this up if you don't want to read that, they're clearly wording these limitations

552
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:03,740
in a way that are temporary and eventually they'll roll out additional features.

553
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,700
But they must have a huge back end they have to sort out.

554
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,920
Once you start high volume Bitcoin trading, it really puts a load on a database.

555
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,000
And in their press release that announced all this, they said, quote, there are no service

556
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,800
fees when buying or selling cryptocurrency through December 31st, 2020.

557
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,240
And there are no fees for holding cryptocurrency in a PayPal account.

558
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,880
What I read out of that statement is there are no service fees when buying or selling

559
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:31,560
cryptocurrency right now until December 31st.

560
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,200
After December 31st, there's going to be fees.

561
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,260
There won't ever be fees for just letting it sit in your account.

562
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,720
But if you want to get it in or out or buy any new stuff, there will be fees.

563
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,200
And that's how eventually PayPal will make money off this.

564
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,520
Yeah, there's a big yet missing from all those statements about it.

565
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,520
They're going to have to charge fees for this.

566
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,380
Otherwise, why are they doing it?

567
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,760
But big picture here, I think this is going to be good to boost the cryptocurrency market.

568
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,260
I mean, it already has brought the value up a bit.

569
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:02,680
But I suspect when you take a 10 year view on digital currencies, PayPal will be the

570
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:09,640
start of that 10 year view where it started bringing digital currencies to the normals.

571
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:15,040
And over the next 10 years, there's going to be a couple of huge moments that make digital

572
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:20,580
currency, just the phrase digital currency, a common phrase among citizens in the states.

573
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:23,040
It's going to be normalized over the next decade.

574
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,980
And it starts today with PayPal.

575
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,520
And I know that sounds like a massive statement.

576
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:31,340
But trust me, come back in 10 years and check my math on this one.

577
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,200
I think the first step was Facebook's Libra.

578
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,280
And this is the second one, really.

579
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,880
Maybe I'm not sure I'm counting that one, since it seems to be a flop.

580
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,040
If PayPal eventually rolls this out where cryptocurrency can be used to interact with

581
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,460
their millions of merchants that they have tens and tens of millions of merchants that

582
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,480
use PayPal, that's going to be a game changer.

583
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,560
But I think this combined with other things that are coming down the pipe are really going

584
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:02,240
to bring digital currency to the masses in a way that Facebook's Libra thing was interesting

585
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,080
as a payment thing online, but this is going to be everyday life.

586
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,400
Digital currency is going to be involved with everyday life.

587
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,560
And I think the reason why this PayPal one is significant is because they see the way

588
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,620
things are trending.

589
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,000
They already see the way things are going and they're acting now.

590
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,720
They're trying to get ahead of it now.

591
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,000
And it's going to become common.

592
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
And if they didn't make this move, they were just going to be left behind.

593
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,200
And that's why when we started, I said this was inevitable.

594
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,920
And it was frustrating to watch them fight it early on.

595
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,720
And I'm not even sure it's good, by the way, because I know I'm going to take a lot of

596
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,400
flack for this from the audience.

597
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,840
I'm not saying I want to give up my cash.

598
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,400
I'm saying it's coming.

599
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,080
And I'm saying we'll look back at it and remember when PayPal started supporting cryptocurrencies.

600
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,080
Oh, yeah.

601
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,160
The move away from cash has very much started already.

602
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:51,600
There's a bunch of businesses that just won't accept cash now because of the global situation.

603
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,720
And I don't think that it'll ever come back for a lot of those businesses because cash

604
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,760
is an expensive overhead for them.

605
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:04,080
They have to count it and put it into the bank and deal with safes and all the rest

606
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
of that.

607
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,080
Whereas digital payments, if it's credit and debit cards or ultimately blockchain based

608
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,840
systems is just so much easier for them to deal with.

609
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,520
So we are definitely heading towards a cashless society.

610
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,880
That is a terrible thing, but it's inevitable and cryptocurrencies are going to be some

611
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
part of that.

612
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,800
I can't tell you, though, how many times I've been working with an international contractor

613
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,840
and we're trying to figure out what the best way to pay them is.

614
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,640
And there's always some service that takes a cut and adds delay.

615
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,520
And every time I'm like using PayPal or something, I think to myself, this would be so much simpler

616
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,520
with Bitcoin.

617
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,120
It just sends directly to them.

618
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,320
You know, it's confirmed within 30 minutes and you've got the money.

619
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:49,480
And there was, you know, if you want to pay a fee for the network to move it quicker,

620
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,600
you can or you can opt not to.

621
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,040
And it's just that simple.

622
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,520
There's not three middlemen.

623
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,720
There's not some currency conversion that has to take place.

624
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,920
There's trusted math in between and it's from my wallet to your wallet.

625
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,440
And then if you want to convert it to a local currency, then you may pay some sort of conversion

626
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
fee.

627
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,440
But that's up to the end user.

628
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,520
And it just seems like such a more straightforward process.

629
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,300
It's weird to feel that way about cryptocurrency, but when you start paying people internationally,

630
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,600
you could see the advantage to it.

631
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,360
Yeah, but the huge disadvantage is the volatility.

632
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:22,160
Thirteen thousand dollars is to the moon, Joe.

633
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,080
Yeah, true.

634
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,720
I can't remember what I said it would be worth at the end of the year now, but we'll get

635
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,720
there shortly.

636
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,620
Well, we will see, because I'm wondering what I said, too.

637
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:34,880
We'll bring you back for the end of your episode and hold you accountable and just hope that

638
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
I was right.

639
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
We'll see.

640
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,280
Well, I'm not going to be completely gone.

641
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,440
I'm going to be editing Linux Unplugged still.

642
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,520
So I'm going to be around the network and I'm also going to be on air with my two shows,

643
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,440
Late Night Linux and Two and a Half Admins, which is written as 2.5 admins.

644
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
So check those out.

645
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
Yeah.

646
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,120

650
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,480

I think I'll still be seeing those emails for a while.

652
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,680
Yeah, probably because I just won't turn it off.

653
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,680
We'll be back next Monday.

654
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:16,040
