00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,240
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,280
This is episode 64, recorded on July 29th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,280
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,280
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,280
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,880
It's good to be connected with you, and let's start things off with a bit of strife over

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,840
at the world's oldest surviving Linux distribution, Slackware.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,880
Yeah, we just talked about this last week, being 25 years old.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,720
And now it turns out that the lead dev has got some pretty serious financial problems.

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,680
In a forum post on linuxquestions.org, Patrick writes that the store, the Slackware merch

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,480
store, has been ripping me off horribly, and I'm very nearly broke.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,640
I have no evidence that they've ever done anything with donations besides their own

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
pockets.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,440
I have not been paid money by them in two years.

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:59,760
The last time he got paid was around the Slackware 14.2 release, which he believes he did not

16
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,800
get a fair share of that.

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,040
And what I read here is somebody who's frustrated.

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,160
Patrick has been really dedicated to his work, and perhaps he hasn't been as focused on the

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,360
business side of things, and that's kind of come around to bite him now.

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,540
This is a very common story, isn't it?

21
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,120
In open source, shock horror, people who are good at creating software and distros and

22
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,880
cool projects aren't necessarily good when it comes to the financial stuff.

23
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,720
Yeah, we can't all be Taylor Swift.

24
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,800
I'll be completely honest.

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,440
I am not a good businessman.

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,040
I can make some podcasts, I can focus on some content, but I could be making way more money

27
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
if I was a good businessman.

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,800
And I don't mean to say that braggadociously.

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,720
I'm saying that as I recognize my own failures and opportunities that I've missed out on

30
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,360
simply because this is not a strong area for me, and if I were to project a little bit

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,000
here, I'd say Patrick probably wanted to focus on Slackware and make Slackware the best it

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,240
can be, which I'll say, having gave a go just a couple of months ago, Slackware is rocking

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
still.

34
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,240
Like, it's still really great.

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,760
I'd say it's the best it's ever been, and he is a huge part of that, and think about

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,440
what he's done for Linux in general as a whole.

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,520
Yeah, there's no doubt, and having looked at it last week, I can see that it's still

38
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,160
adhering to those fundamental principles that Patrick set out in the first place, and it

39
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:21,200
is still a solid distro, but clearly the financial side of things is not his forte.

40
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,820
And so it makes you wonder, would it be better for the likes of Slackware and these other

41
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:31,200
projects that have had financial problems, would it be better for them to be under an

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,360
umbrella organization like Conservancy or something similar, or maybe even Mozilla or

43
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
whoever?

44
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
I was thinking the same thing.

45
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,520
Like, maybe that's the long-term solution.

46
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,360
The short-term solution has been Patrick set up a PayPal account, we'll have a link in

47
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,520
the show notes at linuxactionnews.com slash 64, and that's probably the immediate solution

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,580
is help him fix the hole in his house and those kinds of issues, and then perhaps once

49
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:01,040
he has some breathing room, he looks at doing something like just that, because if you think

50
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,060
about the importance of Slackware, it's a monument in a way to Linux's history.

51
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:13,240
It is a living monument that is still evolving and growing, and it deserves being preserved,

52
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,000
and it should be done in whatever way Patrick is comfortable with.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,040
I think that's a key thing here.

54
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,500
I don't want like some large organization like the Linux Foundation, which I've seen

55
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,280
suggested by many online, swoop in and take ownership.

56
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,760
I wouldn't mind them writing him a paycheck, I wouldn't mind another organization coming

57
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,280
together to help him manage the bills and the business end of things, take care of expenses,

58
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,360
but whatever that long-term solution is, it seems the short-term solution is to help Patrick

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,280
out if you can, and then make room for Patrick to do what he thinks is best with Slackware,

60
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,680
because he's been doing a great job so far.

61
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,240
Yeah, he's been doing it for 25 years, so he's obviously doing something, right?

62
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,740
And he mentioned possibly moving to Patreon, which I think probably makes more sense as

63
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:58,400
it's more reliable and you can kind of see how much you're likely to get every month,

64
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,440
but for now we've got this PayPal link, so do help him out if you can afford it.

65
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,800
Well, I watched the dust up over this in real time on Twitter this week.

66
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,400
There was a bit of outrage when it appeared that Google had rigged YouTube to load faster

67
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,040
on Chrome than say on Firefox or Edge.

68
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,800
Yeah, a lot of people saying that this is Google trying to force people onto Chrome

69
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,500
and deliberately making the experience worse on other browsers, but it's not quite as simple

70
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,500
as that, is it really?

71
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,760
No, in fact, a good resource to go to in this case might be Mozilla's technical program

72
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,800
manager, Chris Peterson, who claims that what you're really seeing here is the new Polymer

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:41,880
redesign that YouTube did that relies on a deprecated Shadow DOM version 0 API, which

74
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,500
is only available in Chrome.

75
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,880
Now it results in a five times slower loading of the initial YouTube page.

76
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,920
Subsequent page navigation is not impacted.

77
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,680
Well, I must say that I struggled to reproduce this.

78
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,360
I read about it and thought I hadn't really noticed that before.

79
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,320
Let me check with Chrome and Firefox on the same machine and I just couldn't reproduce

80
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
it.

81
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,920
This idea of it taking five seconds to load just did not happen for me, I must say.

82
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,720
Well, there's so many factors here.

83
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,800
Not only do you have the connection and all the things in between you and YouTube servers,

84
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,280
but then you also have the YouTube server load at the time and the load on your workstation

85
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,960
at the time.

86
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:27,480
It's almost impossible to notice unless you use tools to specifically measure performance

87
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,720
that account for some of these things, which is exactly what Mozilla's technical program

88
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720
manager did.

89
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,920
And so the numbers do bear out.

90
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,440
Interestingly, Peterson also says that Polymer's latest version, which is this design methodology

91
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,480
and technology, now supports both Shadow DOM 0 and version 1 APIs, but Google is still

92
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:52,480
using the current version of Polymer, but using a deprecated API.

93
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,560
That doesn't really make a lot of sense because if they just use the newer API that the current

94
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,680
version of Polymer, they're using supports, then it would work fine on Edge, Firefox,

95
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,120
Safari, et cetera.

96
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,680
So do you think that there is some truth to this then and Google really do want to force

97
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,680
people onto Chrome?

98
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,740
That'd be some good conspiracy bacon.

99
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:13,560
It feels more like a cost analysis on Google's part.

100
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,580
We've done the work and we have a certain percentage of users, let's for fun say it's

101
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:25,720
20%, 20% of our users are on Firefox and they will experience about a second more load time

102
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,540
than the Chrome users.

103
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,640
And then we'll eventually fix that problem once we push out the next version or something

104
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
like that.

105
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,960
It just feels like a cost analysis where it's almost unnoticeable who's really going to

106
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,120
be running these benchmarks in the next couple of weeks.

107
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,200
It's no big deal.

108
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,800
And then everybody notices because YouTube's a huge site and so now it's a controversy.

109
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,080
But the silver lining of the whole thing is I discovered, and I'll include a link in the

110
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,760
show notes, an extension called YouTube Classic.

111
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,280
This is what YouTube has needed to be for years.

112
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,100
And I've been getting tweets from folks that heard me talk about it on Linux Unplugged

113
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,140
last week who said they just love it.

114
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,840
You install it in Firefox and it just makes YouTube so much better.

115
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,700
No more dynamic comments and dynamic stuff loading.

116
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,080
Everything just snaps like a, nearly like a static HTML site.

117
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:19,000
I have heard some reports that when you uninstall the extension, the effects still remain.

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,860
I have not verified that because I will never in my life be uninstalling this extension,

119
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,440
but just buyer beware.

120
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
I have heard that.

121
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,440
But this really is something to consider if you're on Firefox.

122
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,560
Just bypass all the shenanigans Google's doing and get a great static-like experience on

123
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
YouTube.

124
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,920
You've really sold that to me because I was going to install it to see if I could notice

125
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:42,060
the difference, but then I couldn't see any difference between Firefox and Chrome.

126
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,360
So I didn't see any point, but now that seems very attractive to me.

127
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,040
It's just great because the sidebar loads instantly, the comments load instantly, everything

128
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,440
just pops right in.

129
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,180
You don't have to search around to get to your subscriptions.

130
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,480
They include a link to YouTube TV if you're a YouTube TV subscriber, so you don't have

131
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,280
to go hunt around for that anymore.

132
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,880
Everything's just right there like it should be, a simple, clean design.

133
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,600
Well, don't get too excited, Joe, because where Firefox giveth, it also taketh.

134
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,640
Mozilla has announced it plans to remove some features from future versions of Firefox.

135
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,400
Yeah, live bookmarks and the RSS reader, which I'm afraid to say, neither of which I've ever

136
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,440
used before, so I'm not going to miss them, but I know a lot of people will.

137
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
It's a pretty neat feature.

138
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,360
You can have a folder in your bookmarks menu bar that the individual quote-unquote bookmarks

139
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,080
are generated by an RSS feed.

140
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,800
So like the news of a website, say you subscribe to linuxactionnews.com slash RSS, each episode

141
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,960
would be represented as a bookmark in that folder.

142
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,080
So you click right to it, it's really neat.

143
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,880
And I didn't use it a ton myself, and they write here, after careful consideration of

144
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,720
various options, which also included doing nothing or investing heavily in updating the

145
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,320
code, we have decided to go ahead and remove the built-in feed support from Firefox.

146
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:02,080
So along with the live bookmarks, they're also removing the built-in RSS feed reader.

147
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,840
That I'm a little more partial to.

148
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,920
I again don't use it a ton, but I have absolutely used it to double check RSS feeds in the past

149
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,440
before I toss them into like a central reader or something.

150
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,400
So I'm really going to miss that feature because Chrome doesn't have it either.

151
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,320
Yeah, but surely this is the kind of functionality that can be brought back into Firefox via

152
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,880
extensions if you need it.

153
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,800
And so that makes more sense to me.

154
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,800
If a tiny minority of users are using these features, then it makes sense to take them

155
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,840
out and let those people bring them back in via extensions.

156
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Yep, exactly.

157
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
I completely agree.

158
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,400
And it makes sense to me that this would be, as they write, an outsized maintenance and

159
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,900
security impact relative to the usage because you're pulling in live RSS feeds into these

160
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:50,760
folders or into the browser and you have to constantly account for malicious things that

161
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,600
could be in the feed or malicious embedded images and tracking.

162
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,400
There's a lot of variables and I could definitely see it requiring a decent amount of attention.

163
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,840
And it's such a unique and sort of edge case feature that I also find it pretty believable

164
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,120
that not very many users use it.

165
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,200
So this is one of those calculated decisions that Mozilla has to make from time to time.

166
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,840
This should result in Firefox being better and more secure.

167
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:22,080
And of course, this has absolutely nothing to do with pocket.

Linux Academy is an advanced training platform to teach you everything that runs Linux and

171
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,960
that Linux runs on.

172
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,680
They've just rolled out a ton of new Red Hat Enterprise content as well as AWS and Google

173
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,940
Cloud content.

174
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,800
They've also just launched a weekly Google Cloud show on their YouTube channel.

175
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,960
And their CEO and founder, Anthony James, just posted a video today, a lightning guide

176
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,840
on getting Docker going in five minutes.

177
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,640
And that's just the stuff they're giving away for free.

178
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,600
And when you become a subscriber, you'll see that they've been expanding their content

179
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,320
library like crazy this year.

180
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,200
They've expanded on Azure, AWS, the Google Cloud platform, and of course, Linux and all

181
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
the essentials itself.

182
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,680
In fact, that's an area that just got a large amount of refreshing.

183
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,360
That's another thing that they're super committed to is keeping all of their content as up to

184
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,400
date and as fresh as possible.

189
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:36,280
OK, let's talk about Germany and a local authority there moving away from Linux and back to Windows.

190
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,480
Not Munich this time.

191
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
It's a new one.

192
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,800
It is Lower Saxony and it is yet more bad news for FOSS in Europe.

193
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:48,720
I'm a bit surprised after the recent reporting back in January that the cost of Munich switching

194
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,160
back to Windows is already over 100 million.

195
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,840
So it's not necessarily going well, but yeah, the tax office has argued that this decision

196
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:03,240
is driven simply by compatibility with field workers and teleworkers who overwhelmingly

197
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:08,960
are using Windows while their openSUSE variants that they have on their office workstations

198
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,000
are of an older generation.

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,680
In fact, the workstations themselves are being replaced.

200
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,240
They're aging out, which is sort of opening the door for a great deal on Windows 10 and

201
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,980
an opportunity to switch away.

202
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,360
The move is still in its early stages with Lower Saxony governments currently defining

203
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,000
the framework conditions of the migration, but it's going to be followed by a preselection

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,280
of possible solutions and then they'll begin to move.

205
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,720
I don't know what's wrong with me, but in a way it almost feels necessary.

206
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,440
Like like the move back to Windows isn't necessarily a loss anymore for GNU slash Linux.

207
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,000
Like it might have been, say, 10 years ago when they started getting this underway.

208
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,320
And you know, I do recall on the Linux Action Show clearly talking about these massive 13,000

209
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,600
user migrations and what a great victory this was for Linux.

210
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,040
And now, of course, here I am 10 years later saying, ah, this is no big deal.

211
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,440
It's totally fine.

212
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,280
But I feel like the environment has changed so much.

213
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:08,780
Back then we were so focused on making sure that the desktop was successful and that the

214
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,680
Tivoization of Linux didn't happen.

215
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,240
Well, the Tivoization of Linux is what took Linux to the next level and it's now in everyone's

216
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,120
pocket and Linux took over the server space.

217
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:26,420
And so these minor losses or wins on the desktop just don't really feel as substantial anymore.

218
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,800
And it feels like the long term momentum of the Linux desktop's still going in a great

219
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,800
direction.

220
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,220
The trend is good for us.

221
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,600
And if Microsoft managed to convince a few bureaucrats that they should move back to

222
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,600
Windows when they buy new PCs, so be it.

223
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,760
Because chances are those PCs are going to be connecting to servers running Linux.

224
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,280
Well, that is true, and it begs the question, is this the end of the myth that it's cheaper

225
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,680
to use Linux instead of Windows in these enterprise installations?

226
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,680
Yeah, maybe.

227
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,020
I think you just touched on what it really is about this that I'm okay with.

228
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:02,200
And that is I kind of feel like this is cleaning house of people that were sold on a dream.

229
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:08,400
And that dream was switch to Linux and your total cost of IT will go way, way down because

230
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,080
you won't be buying licenses every 10 years.

231
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
It just doesn't really work like that.

232
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,320
And the reality is that the business either go with a subscription plan and they spread

233
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:23,020
that cost out, or they just budget for it every three to 10 years to refresh machines

234
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,260
and software.

235
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,480
And it's just part of the cost of doing business.

236
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,160
And they are okay with that.

237
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,840
That's the reality of that situation.

238
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,480
And then once you build IT processes and tools around managing Windows, you just need to

239
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,720
have people that know what they're doing.

240
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,940
And it's essentially the same cost as running free software.

241
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,940
That's the reality of it.

242
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,960
Once you've initially purchased those licenses and have those systems deployed, if you have

243
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,140
the right people in place managing it and the right software to manage it, it's one

244
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,140
or the other.

245
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:56,960
And so selling it solely on saving money or saving you from XYZ is a bit of a myth as

246
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,960
you put it.

247
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:01,660
And the reality is there's other advantages to using the Linux stack that I think now

248
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,880
sell it and that creates that momentum I was talking about.

249
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,680
Like it's great to be on that stack if you're deploying applications in the cloud.

250
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,000
Why not develop and use the very operating system you're deploying your critical software

251
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
on?

252
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,200
That's an obvious value right there that the Linux desktop brings to a huge market.

253
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,440
And there's many other examples of that.

254
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,280
And so those legitimate work cases sell themselves now.

255
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,040
But this myth that you're going to save $10,000 to $100,000 a year because you just switched

256
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,200
to Linux, I kind of think that is dying.

257
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,760
And it's perfectly fine with me because we have plenty of other good things going for

258
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,760
us.

259
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:40,240
And you can save however many bitcoins it works out to be when you don't get the ransomware

260
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,560
that you otherwise would with Windows.

261
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
Yeah, that's true.

262
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,760
And I think you could make a legitimate argument that public funds shouldn't be spent on big

263
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,260
commercial license contracts, that they should go towards free software that continues to

264
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,260
improve that software.

265
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,380
I think that's a great argument you could make.

266
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,000
But for general businesses and people that just look at this from a numbers standpoint,

267
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
yeah, we're just not winning that fight on that level anymore.

268
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,520
But I think the security aspect is where we should be pushing this.

269
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,800
That's the primary reason why I run Linux on the desktop.

270
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,920
I do enjoy all the freedoms and the open source and all the rest of it, but I wouldn't feel

271
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,700
comfortable using a Windows machine or even a Mac for that matter to log into my bank

272
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
and stuff.

273
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,500
I trust Linux where I don't trust Windows.

274
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:30,600
And I think that it's far easier to convince enterprises and individuals when you go for

275
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:37,000
a real pragmatic reason like that rather than this ideological reason of, as you say, spending

276
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,980
public money to improve the software and everything.

277
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,120
That's kind of a bit wishy-washy, whereas saying to people, this is going to be more

278
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,600
secure, I think that's a far easier sell.

279
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,360
And there's tons of versions of that.

280
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,080
This is going to be more reliable.

281
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,160
This is something that you can track publicly and plan for major changes and not get surprised

282
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,520
by a commercial vendor's sudden change in direction.

283
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:02,840
This is something that is sustainable that the vendor won't lose interest in.

284
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,920
Like there's all kinds of advantages for workstations and servers that have nothing to do with performance

285
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,340
or even security.

286
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:14,060
So I think losing a couple of arguments here and there about total cost of ownership on

287
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:19,240
a desktop in an environment where you have to potentially interact with the public and

288
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,720
you have to interact with home employees who are on their home Windows boxes, that's just,

289
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,960
you're never going to win that argument and we maybe shouldn't have tried.

290
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,560
Well, one argument for moving over to Linux they definitely shouldn't be using and that

291
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:37,120
is being able to revitalize old hardware, especially 32-bit hardware, because there

292
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,920
is yet another reason to not use 32-bit Linux anymore.

293
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:46,240
Ooh, that sounds grim and it is kind of true, although there is, again, a bit of a silver

294
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,240
lining here.

295
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:53,440
So this is really about protecting 32-bit processors against those side channel attacks

296
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,960
that we've been talking about since January.

297
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:03,740
And the technology that's now coming from the x86-64 side to the 32-bit side is kernel-based

298
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:08,740
page table isolation, something we've talked a lot about in TechSnap that mitigates the

299
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,980
meltdown CPU vulnerability.

300
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,320
Now KPTI has been in the Linux kernel since about January and it's been in development

301
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,100
much longer than that.

302
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:23,440
But 32-bit support has been on the back burner really since the whole meltdown thing came

303
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,200
into public light and they had to accelerate that project.

304
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:33,520
But now, with the upcoming 4.19 kernel, KPTI is landing in the Linux 32-bit version of

305
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,240
the kernel and Michael Irabel over at Voronix has some early benchmarks and they're devastating.

306
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,760
Yeah, it's a real performance hit on a lot of applications.

307
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,600
But you did say there's a silver lining, it can be disabled at boot time and it's not

308
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,200
necessary to use it, but if you want to be 100% secure then it kind of is.

309
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,560
And to me, this just feels like the death of 32-bit, really.

310
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,720
It's time, isn't it?

311
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,000
We've talked about various distros dropping 32-bit, now it just feels like it's time to

312
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
put it to bed.

313
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,880
Yeah, my only thought here is there still is room for improvement.

314
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:18,400
When KPTI first landed on the 64 side of the kernel, it took, you know, months of updating

315
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,720
additional patches and releases to really get the performance where they wanted it.

316
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,820
That may still happen, maybe at a slower pace for 32-bit, but the other thing that I can't

317
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,360
really help but think is, you know, if you're living on a 32-bit machine, if you maybe have

318
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,440
one in the closet doing a web server or something like that, are you super worked up about the

319
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,840
performance at this point?

320
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,280
I mean, you know, it's like shaving off another 10%, maybe 15%, are you really all that concerned?

321
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,320
And just like on 64-bit, it really strikes you when it's multiple IO subsystems that

322
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,440
get stressed at once.

323
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,960
So if you start stressing your CPU and your network card and you need to hit your disk

324
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,500
a little bit, your workloads just drop off a cliff.

325
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,040
It's really the same thing that started happening with 64-bit.

326
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:05,120
They began working on multi-level areas of improvement in the kernel to fix that.

327
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,820
There's still people working on that for the 64-bit kernel right now as we speak, so some

328
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:14,560
of that may find its way down to 32-bit or it may just simply not have enough interest.

329
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:19,840
Yeah, but that extra 10% or 15% makes a massive difference when you've got such limited resources

330
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,320
in the first place.

331
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:26,360
And so it could turn a potentially usable 32-bit machine into something that is just

332
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,640
a nightmare to use.

333
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,700
Yeah, I agree.

334
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,400
If you're going to stick with 32-bit and you're not that concerned about meltdown, you may

335
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:38,440
want to look into the no PTI option, which is a boot flag, which will disable that stuff

336
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,440
at boot time.

337
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,820
Yeah, and of course, a distro that I would run on old hardware like that, my go-to has

338
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,880
always been Lubuntu, but maybe not for long.

339
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,420
Times they are changing, Joe.

340
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,560
This is over on the Lubuntu blog.

341
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,500
Now when you think of Lubuntu, you might think of LXDE, but it's actually based on LXCute,

342
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,620
which is a rebirth on newer Qt technologies.

343
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:07,760
And they write about shifting their focus from providing a distribution for old hardware

344
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,920
to a functional yet modular distribution focused on getting out of the way and letting users

345
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,640
use their computer.

346
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,200
And they talk a little bit about setting what they see as their difference here, because

347
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,220
you may draw a comparison between Kubuntu and Lubuntu.

348
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:29,340
Both are now Qt-based desktops on top of an Ubuntu 18.04 stack.

349
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:35,440
So they took an 18.04.1 install with two gigabytes of RAM and one CPU core in QEMU, and they

350
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,320
looked at an idle system with LibreOffice open and Firefox open just at the Lubuntu.me

351
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
site.

352
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,980
On Kubuntu, the system is using one gig of RAM and around 6% idle CPU.

353
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:54,640
With the same setup and the same programs on a Lubuntu 32-bit install, they're using

354
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,240
790 megabytes of RAM, and it's 7% of CPU.

355
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,680
So a couple hundred megabytes of RAM savings, which some of that may be attributed to being

356
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:10,740
on 32-bit, by the way, and 7%, 1% more CPU usage, which is the standout difference between

357
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,200
Kubuntu and Lubuntu.

358
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,520
Which is not a huge difference, really, especially when you take into account that 32-bit aspect

359
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,520
with the RAM.

360
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,280
It goes to show how lean the plasma desktop is these days.

361
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,700
Yeah, and that would, I would assume, be a stock Kubuntu install, which if you were trying

362
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,340
to make it run on a system, you'd probably rip out the file indexer.

363
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,960
You'd probably turn the compositor off.

364
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,640
There's areas of modularity where you can pull things out and make it use even less

365
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,960
RAM and less disk space and less CPU.

366
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,460
I've had it working on a now 11-year-old system that it's remarkable how well it performs.

367
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:52,080
But I think there is more to LXQt than we have here in this blog post, which you really

368
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:59,400
have is a simple minimal workspace that really is just modern technologies that get out of

369
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,720
your way.

370
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,880
There's one thing for plasma that you could argue is there's a lot going on in some areas

371
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,760
where this is a more minimal approach.

372
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,060
Yeah, there are clearly differences between the two desktops, and I don't think they will

373
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,840
ever get away from this idea of it being for older hardware.

374
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,480
But what is older hardware keeps changing, doesn't it?

375
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,560
Of course, as we progress through time, something from 10 years ago is suddenly not as crusty

376
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,480
as something from 10 years ago, five years ago, if you know what I mean.

377
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,480
I do.

378
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,080
And they're recognizing that fact, and they're trying to update their, I guess you could

379
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,560
call it vision statement, for the reality that systems even from 10 years ago are 64-bit.

380
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:46,160
The only issue I have with that is I think that reduces some of their competitive advantage.

381
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:52,560
In a way, their competitive advantage would be that you could still get pretty good performance

382
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:56,960
out of an older system as they begin to turn away some of those.

383
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,620
I'm not sure, but to me, it seems to leave a question of, okay, what is your standout

384
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,520
difference from main plasma, and how can you better refine that?

385
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,680
I like this blog post they've taken here, and I like to think of it as a version one.

386
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,600
In version two or three, I would like to see things that really actually make it standout.

387
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,720
So when they say their main focus is shifting from providing a distribution for old hardware

388
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,500
to a functional yet modern distribution focused on getting out of the way and letting users

389
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,280
use their computer, I love that idea.

390
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,360
I love that idea so much.

391
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,840
I've also heard it, and I'm sure they've heard this criticism a thousand times now, from

392
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,060
about 30 other distributions out there.

393
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:39,200
It's almost like a copy and paste job, and it's a good intent, and it's a good starting

394
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,820
point, and it's a statement I completely agree with.

395
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,920
What I would like to see is some refinement in there on what they're doing that the 29

396
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,160
other guys that also wrote that statement aren't already doing.

397
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,680
I think you could make that same exact case for Linux Mint.

398
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,960
I think you could make that same exact argument for Antegros.

399
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,120
I think you could make that same exact case for Ubuntu Mate.

400
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,000
I think you could make that same case for Ubuntu, Fedora, so on and so forth.

401
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,120
Focused on getting out of the way and letting users do their work is practically the mantra

402
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,820
for every desktop environment in existence, even the ones that don't get out of your way.

403
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:14,720
So that could use some refinement and something that really makes it clear what makes Lubuntu

404
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,880
standout.

405
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,800
And I think they'll probably get there, and if you consider this as a starting point,

406
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,400
this is a great intent and shows a lot of potential.

407
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,440
Well, what could make them stand out is the fact that they're using the LXQt desktop,

408
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,520
because Fedora might be dropping that soon if they don't get enough testing of that.

409
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:39,080
So we might end up with Lubuntu being the only big distro, as it were, that is based

410
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
on LXQt.

411
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,700
You've got the Ubuntu base, which a lot of people like, and the LXQt desktop.

412
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,040
So that might be a USP that's big enough for them.

413
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,560
Yeah, I think that's pretty on point.

414
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,600
And this is also still early days for LXQt.

415
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,740
There's still much more to come, and that desktop may end up being a standout star that

416
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,740
draws people in.

417
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:00,720
Well, it is already pretty solid, and it's early days, as you say, and it seems like

418
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,900
a prime candidate to me for your OBS machine.

419
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,200
Maybe it'll finally stop crashing.

420
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,080
Yeah, a lean, mean broadcasting workstation.

421
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,360
I could see that.

422
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,880
And like on a laptop on remote location where I really want to give all of my horsepower

423
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,360
to my multitrack recorder, again, LXQt can make a lot of sense there.

424
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,800
So we'll keep an eye on these developments and everything in the Linux and open source
