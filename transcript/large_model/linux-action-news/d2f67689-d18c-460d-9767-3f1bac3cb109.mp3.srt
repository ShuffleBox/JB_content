00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,200
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,320
This is episode 47, recorded on March 31st, 2018.

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,320
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,320
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,320
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,200
It's good to be connected with you, especially on a week when we have a stacked news docket

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,920
and we kick things off with a tablet that's running Chrome OS.

8
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:39,360
Yeah, this is an Acer tablet, and it's definitely got nothing to do with the Apple tablet that's

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,200
aimed at education that came out this week at all.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,720
No, no, absolutely no coincidence in timing here.

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,800
Yeah.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,880
So this is a 9.7 inch tablet that runs Google Chrome, but it also supports Android apps,

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,000
which they've been working on for quite a while.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,040
And last I heard, weren't very good, really.

15
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,720
So I hope they've improved that.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,000
How much does that matter?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,980
Because this is really aimed at the educational market, isn't it?

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,960
It's priced for the educational market.

19
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,840
It's positioned to the educational market.

20
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,280
And that sector, from my own experience with my kids, it's really there about the Google

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,600
apps and the Chrome web browser, and you just need the cheapest device possible to run those

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,600
things.

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,920
But is this the cheapest possible device at $329, the same price as the iPad?

24
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,860
That is where it doesn't quite make sense to me.

25
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,060
What you get spec-wise, it's a good value.

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,560
You get 4 gigs of RAM, 32 gigabytes of built-in storage, plus it has eMMC storage.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,760
There's also USB 3.1 Type-C, so you could essentially hook up a thumb drive, microSD

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,320
card reader, and a headphone jack all in this device.

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:53,160
That same package, especially if you consider the 5 megapixel camera, the Wi-Fi AC chipset,

30
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,520
it's $499 from Samsung in a traditional Chromebook configuration.

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,720
So their $329 price tag, I don't think it's just cutting off the keyboard that got them

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
to that price.

33
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,280
They're intentionally getting it down to a range that is at least competitive for the

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,820
educational market.

35
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,480
If it's a good competitor, I don't know about that.

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,560
I'm not so sure.

37
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,960
But the pricing, they seem to be taking a bit of a loss here, at least if you go by

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,040
Samsung pricing.

39
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,720
And is Chrome OS even really ready for a touchscreen interface?

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,540
I know that a lot of the Chromebooks, the modern ones, have come with a touchscreen,

41
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,920
but it's still an operating system that is very much designed around a keyboard and touchpad

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,920
or mouse, isn't it?

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,920
Yeah.

44
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,980
I don't have, pardon the pun, hands-on experience with this on Chrome OS yet.

45
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,480
But I do know from following the news for the last few years, they've been slowly adding

46
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,520
more and more touch capabilities.

47
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,880
And to your earlier point, if you're using this thing for Android applications, the touch

48
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,600
support is even more relevant.

49
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Yeah.

50
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,920
We've kind of seen this merging of Chrome OS and Android for quite a while now, haven't

51
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
we?

52
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,360
So I wonder which way it's going to shake out.

53
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,160
Is it going to be that they'll end up going completely Chrome OS or completely Android,

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
I wonder?

55
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
Yeah.

56
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,600
It just seems like it'd be easier to focus on one thing, not just from Google's personnel

57
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,520
and investment standpoint, but it'd be nice to have a clear, concise story for school

58
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,520
districts.

59
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,720
Should you be investing in managing Android devices or investing in managing Chrome OS

60
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,720
devices?

61
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,640
Because think about this from the IT admin standpoint.

62
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:36,760
You have tens of thousands of end users, and you've got five people in your department.

63
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,760
That's the reality.

64
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,500
So how do you manage these devices?

65
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,040
How do you do this at scale?

66
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,480
How do you charge these things?

67
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,200
How do you move them between classrooms?

68
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,120
Tablets, Chromebooks, and iPads all have different answers with different levels of complication,

69
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,260
with different levels of completeness to that whole story.

70
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,680
And I'm not sure if Google is really serving anybody by splitting the narrative here.

71
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,960
But that's what Google does.

72
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,840
They've got how many chat apps?

73
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,040
They always hedge their bets, don't they?

74
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,960
Maybe and maybe in the long term that does work out.

75
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:12,600
I would bet that this is based on the fact that they've had huge success with Chrome

76
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:18,520
OS on traditional Chromebooks in classrooms, and there is somewhat of a demand for some

77
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,640
type of tablet touchscreen type device that's extremely portable.

78
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,460
And Google's hoping to capitalize on the existing success and leverage it on these tablets.

79
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,320
It's a little bit ham-fisted, though.

80
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,380
And maybe that's where Apple has a competitive advantage, especially when you start to get

81
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,840
in the same price territory.

82
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,160
But remember, if you have one solution to manage Chromebooks, then you probably can

83
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,280
use that same exact solution to manage these tablets.

84
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,720
And for these understaffed IT departments, that can be extremely valuable.

85
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,200
Well, one solution that they definitely won't be using is Firefox OS, which we knew was

86
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,940
dead but now it is officially 100% dead.

87
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,480
The App Store has been closed down and that is it for Firefox OS.

88
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Rest in peace.

89
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,880
Yeah, it's not just dead for those of us who didn't have a device yet.

90
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,320
But this kind of kills it off for all of you who are still holding on.

91
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,240
But you know, not to pile on to Firefox here, Firefox OS, they had a valiant attempt.

92
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,360
Microsoft hasn't released a Windows phone in years.

93
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,480
Blackberry doesn't release Blackberry OS devices anymore.

94
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,440
They now are focusing on Android devices.

95
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,520
And there's few other smartphone operating systems in existence.

96
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,080
We cover Sailfish X sometimes here on the show.

97
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,160
And we just recently talked about WebOS, but that's not anywhere on phones.

98
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,520
Ubuntu Touch is now living on as an open source project that's also fighting the good fight.

99
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,940
I don't think we can necessarily blame Firefox OS for not succeeding in this market.

100
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,320
It's just simply iOS and Android and their respective ecosystems have it all locked up.

101
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,100
Yeah, but wasn't it supposed to be on TVs and stuff as well?

102
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,600
And we've not seen enough of that to justify keeping this App Store running, it seems.

103
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
True.

104
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
That's true.

105
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,440
I mean, Firefox OS and other homebrewed operating systems and just the general availability

106
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,580
of the Linux kernel probably solved that problem.

107
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,120
There wasn't anybody really asking for Firefox OS on a TV.

108
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,480
It was never really built properly in the first place, though, was it?

109
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,280
The fact that you couldn't update the browser without updating the whole OS and stuff, it

110
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,320
just seemed to have been put together just badly.

111
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,080
And I'm not surprised at all that it's ended up going this way, the way of all the other

112
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,080
attempts pretty much.

113
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,200
You know, I could still be convinced that a browser that runs all of your apps and your

114
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,600
general desktop shell on a phone is a good idea.

115
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,720
I mean, as long as it's done right, somebody could convince me of that.

116
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,560
So I wouldn't say that necessarily sank it or not.

117
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,000
But to me, it feels like there's a larger lesson for open source projects to take on

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
here.

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,760
And that's one that will surprise no one in our audience.

120
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:57,680
iOS and Android have this whole market sewn up because they have these incredible ecosystems.

121
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,760
And there is another way to approach this problem.

122
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,200
Like our friends over at Plasma Mobile seem to be doing it in a very humble and steady

123
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:09,480
approach that may eventually work because there's a lot of us enthusiasts out here that

124
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,000
want an OS we can load on our own hardware.

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,200
Well, yeah, same with Ubuntu Touch.

126
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,720
You reports, guys.

127
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,760
That is the way to do it is to be humble and slowly but surely build something that works

128
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:27,200
really well and not try and have these huge launches and everything like we've seen from

129
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,560
Mozilla with Firefox OS.

130
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,120
So my money is still on Ubuntu Touch, I think.

131
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,080
They're getting rid of scopes now and focusing on getting Android apps running in an inbox.

132
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,240
So I think that it's going to be a big year for them.

133
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,360
I said that in our predictions show and I'm sticking by it.

134
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,920
I'm not quite sure what to make of this next story.

135
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:53,120
It's either Google oppressing an open source project during a critical moment while they're

136
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:01,100
trying to establish their identity or it's Google playing softball and appeasing a heavy-handed

137
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,680
copyright lobby.

138
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,140
Yeah, this is Google removing Kodi from autocomplete in the search.

139
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:14,960
So if you search for K-O-D, then it's not going to suggest Kodi for you or add-ons for

140
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,040
K-O, it's not going to suggest Kodi.

141
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,720
And I think it's probably the latter.

142
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:28,440
I think that it is Google bowing to pressure from the copyright lobbyists and the whole

143
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,080
entertainment industry that are obsessed with Kodi, like they were obsessed with torrents

144
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,960
and stuff years ago.

145
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,480
Now they've realized that most people who want to watch copyrighted material for free

146
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:45,360
will do it via streaming and Kodi is one of the biggest ways to do that.

147
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,920
So I suppose if this is all it takes to appease them as far as Google's concerned, then it's

148
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,900
not a huge issue.

149
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:59,940
But it does speak to this bigger point, doesn't it, that Kodi is basically a toxic brand at

150
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,400
this point, depending on how you look at it.

151
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,440
It's either this amazing way to get loads of free, cool entertainment or if you are

152
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,080
in the entertainment industry, it is a completely toxic word.

153
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,360
But Kodi in of itself, as we always talk about this, is just free open source software that

154
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,640
just plays media.

155
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,920
You have to supply the streams or the media in order to use it.

156
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,160
And in of itself, it's completely harmless.

157
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:33,360
So they've got this real problem, the XBMC foundation, of what to do about this brand.

158
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,640
I mean, do they have to rebrand again?

159
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,880
They rebranded from XBMC to Kodi.

160
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,360
Maybe that's the only solution here.

161
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,760
You know, that's a good idea, I think, because the open source community will follow.

162
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
We'll all understand.

163
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,320
This is a game we've kind of gotten used to.

164
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,800
And this is a weird position that Google is in.

165
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,520
They want to play ball with the companies that they want to sell movies for on Play

166
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,900
and YouTube.

167
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,840
So of course, they have to be accommodating.

168
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:04,000
And if Google doesn't take action, then Google gets branded as being complicit in piracy.

169
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,800
So their limp-wristed response is, well, we'll just sort of nuke its autocomplete.

170
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,960
You can still type in Kodi and hit Search and still get all the results.

171
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,600
And if you start typing in Kodi, you start to get suggestions for things like Kodak or

172
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,540
Kodiak bears.

173
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,960
It's really awkward.

174
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:28,760
And I wish Google would take a firmer stance here and say, no, this is an open source platform

175
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,620
that can be used for good or bad, because Kodi really is now in our super hard spot.

176
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:41,020
They have been aggressively for the last couple of years trying to remove the Kodi name from

177
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,160
piracy.

178
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,120
They've even reached out to the MPAA.

179
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,340
They've taken a very hard stance in public forums denouncing piracy.

180
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:56,520
They have really gone as far as a project possibly can, even borderline crossing the

181
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
line.

182
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:04,460
In fact, at scale, that was a topic of conversation, is that perhaps the Kodi project is too mean

183
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,840
because they're yelling at people on Twitter about piracy.

184
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,280
Well, is it not hypocritical of them to complain about piracy?

185
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:19,540
Because let's face it, is anybody using Kodi to watch or listen to anything other than

186
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,080
copyrighted material that they don't have the proper rights to watch?

187
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,080
That's the whole point of it.

188
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,920
Yes, in of itself, it's not doing anything wrong and it's totally legal and all the rest

189
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:37,080
of it, but I can't think of anyone who uses it to watch anything other than pirated material.

190
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:43,760
You know what, as far as I know, what they care about are the add-ons that enable streaming

191
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,340
of content.

192
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:52,320
If you have a big old NAS full of television and movie shows, they don't like that, but

193
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,200
that's not why they're going after Kodi, because they realize you could use VLC to play it

194
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,360
on a TV with a laptop hooked up to a TV screen.

195
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:05,640
It's the one touch, hit a button, and now you are torrent streaming the latest movies.

196
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,840
What really gets them fired up, and I remember this from last when we were covering this

197
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,680
story on Linux Action News, or I'm sorry, Linux Action Show way back in the day now,

198
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:20,000
feels like a decade ago, they care about the add-ons that people are selling that come

199
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,320
pre-bundled into a box.

200
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,480
You go buy a NUC or you go buy a media center PC, you hook it up to your TV's HDMI port

201
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,440
and Bob's your uncle, you've got Kodi with this one click, you're streaming torrent movies.

202
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,740
That's what they're upset about.

203
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,520
They think that's going to be the big, big consumer revolution, that consumers are going

204
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,320
to rush out and it's going to be the new VCR, and Kodi is going to be the enabler of a whole

205
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,040
new generation of VCRs.

206
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,160
That's what they think is happening.

207
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:53,640
If you're streaming it over Samba or NFS or DNLA on your LAN, I don't think they care.

208
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,680
The thing is though that KodiBox is like a name brand at this point.

209
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,920
It's a household name.

210
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,160
I know plenty of normal people who don't know anything about technology, don't even have

211
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,560
a laptop at this point.

212
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,320
They just have a phone and a KodiBox that they bought off eBay or something.

213
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,520
They didn't configure any of the add-ons.

214
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,760
They come pre-loaded or fully loaded or whatever, and that is the reality of the situation.

215
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,400
There are a lot of people, there are probably millions of people out there who have bought

216
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,160
these boxes and are streaming all this content for free.

217
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:33,320
I would wager there are more users of Plex and there are more customers using Rokus with

218
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,880
Plex installed streaming downloaded television shows than all of the KodiBox users in the

219
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,920
world though.

220
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,320
So if it doesn't stop with Kodi, then where does it end?

221
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,480
Does MB become next and then after MB do they move on to Plex and then after Plex do they

222
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,880
move on to Roku?

223
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,240
Where does this end?

224
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,560
There has to be some sort of rational distinction between the software that's capable of playing

225
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,200
files and has the capability of add-ons just like a web browser versus something that is

226
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,760
pre-built and pre-engineered to steal content.

227
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:14,360
That's a big difference and going back to the Google point here, Google is complicit

228
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,200
now in branding Kodi as a piracy tool because now they are one more organization that is

229
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,280
shunning them.

230
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,920
They're playing ball with organizations who misunderstand and misrepresent what the Kodi

231
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,680
project is about and that's why it's a shame.

232
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,280
Not because it won't auto-complete anymore but simply because Google didn't take a stance

233
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:42,320
and defend open source but yet they bang that open source drum on a daily basis.

234
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,320
Lass.ting.com.

235
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,420
It's smarter than unlimited.

236
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,720
If you just use Lass, you pay less.

237
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
Lass.ting.com.

238
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,400
Take $25 off a device or if you bring your own, they will give you $25 in service credit.

239
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:03,800
Now your average Ting bill is just $23 per phone per month because it's pay for what

240
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,280
you use wireless.

241
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,840
$6 a month for the line and then you just pay for your minutes, your messages and your

242
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,840
megabytes.

243
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,200
However much you use, that's what you pay.

244
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,080
It's really, really simple.

245
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:23,000
That is the entire Ting story, $6 and then there's an Uncle Sam cut there.

246
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,380
What you use, no contract, no service agreement, that's it.

247
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,440
And then it's just like everything on top of it just is better.

248
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,880
Great customer service, you get to talk to real human beings.

249
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,820
The best dashboard in mobile to manage everything from the devices you have active to their

250
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,360
individual services, all of it.

251
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,880
They even have a great app for Android and iOS.

252
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,640
And then my personal favorite feature, although it's something you never have to worry about

253
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,800
with Ting if you don't want, but it's a thing I love, they have a GSM and a CDMA network.

254
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,860
In the States, that's great.

255
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,800
In the Pacific Northwest, there is clear areas where CDMA simply performs better because

256
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,320
of the install, the hills, the trees, all of that.

257
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,400
And when I am traveling, there's areas where GSM just rocks it and I can switch between

258
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
them.

259
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
My Nexus 6P supports both.

260
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
I love that.

261
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,020
You can get a device from Ting directly or bring your own, and because they have those

262
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,480
two networks, there's a ton they support.

263
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,320
Just check out their BYOT page, lass.ting.com.

264
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
While you're there, check out their blog.

265
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,080
They have a post right now about Hiya, which helps block unwanted calls on both iOS and

266
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,080
Android.

267
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,080
I installed it.

268
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
I love it.

269
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,140
That Ting blog is great.

270
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,640
Just start by going to lass.ting.com.

271
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,640
That's lass.ting.com.

272
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:44,680
Okay, so we managed to avoid this last week, but the time has come to talk about Facebook

273
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,800
and that whole controversy that went on with Cambridge Analytica.

274
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,440
Now Mozilla have come out with an add-on for Firefox, which somewhat helps protect your

275
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,720
privacy by isolating Facebook in a container.

276
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,960
I think this is pretty neat.

277
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:05,320
In fact, I almost would want to recommend anybody using Facebook, check this out.

278
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:09,000
Even if you're typically a Chrome user, I think this is worth checking out.

279
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I think this is a simplification of an extension that I've used before that allows you to sort

280
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,440
of pop different tabs into their own individual containers.

281
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,680
Now let's back up.

282
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,600
This one's focused on Facebook, and it works by isolating your Facebook identity into a

283
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,320
separate container that makes it hard for Facebook to track the visits to other sites

284
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,920
and other things you do on the internet.

285
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,960
Once you install this extension, it deletes your Facebook cookies and it logs you out

286
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
of Facebook.

287
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,960
Tried this myself.

288
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,080
That's exactly what happens.

289
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:45,840
The next time you go to Facebook and you log in, it's all inside this little container.

290
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,340
If you click Facebook share buttons on other browser tabs, it will load them within the

291
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,320
Facebook container.

292
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,520
It's pretty nice.

293
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,400
There are some caveats, some downsides.

294
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,160
It's important for you to realize it doesn't prevent Facebook from mishandling the data

295
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,740
themselves, like that they already have on you.

296
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:07,260
You're not preventing them from selling your information.

297
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,840
You're just limiting the new information that they can track.

298
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:18,400
Also if you use Facebook to log into other services on the web, like Facebook login functionality,

299
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,320
that's probably not going to work.

300
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,440
The one tab can't talk to the other tab.

301
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,760
That's the whole point of the container system.

302
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,280
So that's a bit of a bummer if you use Facebook login for some stuff.

303
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,800
Well, jokes on Facebook, I don't use my real name or post any real data on any of my Facebook

304
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,600
accounts, my many different Facebook accounts, which I probably shouldn't admit to having,

305
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,600
should I?

306
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,680
But I'm not going to use this because I just don't need to really.

307
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:50,880
I don't have any information on there that they could use about me.

308
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,260
None of that information is valuable.

309
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,100
It's more about them tracking you as you go across the web though, because every website

310
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,760
that has a Facebook like, they're now tracking when you visit that website.

311
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,400
If it's got a like button anywhere on the page, then they know you went there.

312
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,360
Yeah, which is pretty scary, which is why I tend to be logged out and I tend to not

313
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,200
really use Facebook on my laptop at all anyway.

314
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,920
I kind of just lurk a little bit on my phone and I definitely haven't installed the app

315
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,400
or the messenger app.

316
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,800
One thing that's interesting is that they've been collecting loads of data by using that

317
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,880
messenger app and they've basically forced you to use the app.

318
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,680
I don't know if you've ever had Facebook messages on the mobile website.

319
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,800
I completely refuse to use it.

320
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,600
I have lots and lots and lots of messages waiting for me.

321
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,920
I get them from family too, but that was just a line too far for me.

322
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,920
Yeah.

323
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,840
Well, you get that notification and then you click it and then it opens the Play Store

324
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,120
and wants you to install the messenger and I'm like, no thanks, but I've got a little

325
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
hack for you.

326
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,720
You can do a desktop version of the site and then you can use messenger, very clunky and

327
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,720
stuff, but if you absolutely have to send a message in Facebook on your phone, that's

328
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
how to do it.

329
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,840
But yeah, I mean, I'm not a big Facebook user anyway.

330
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,880
It's just something that I lurk and mostly really the only account that I ever really

331
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:14,160
use is the one to post shows for late night Linux just because there's a small community

332
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,480
there of people who want to use Facebook.

333
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,280
But if you are forced to use Facebook like most people are to stay in touch with family

334
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,760
and friends, then this container add on for Firefox seems like a pretty decent way to

335
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,760
go.

336
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
I agree.

337
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,880
And speaking of tracking services, if you have multiple Google accounts or multiple

338
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,000
Twitter accounts or whatever, maybe just check out the multi account container extension,

339
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,380
which I'll link at linuxactionnews.com slash 47.

340
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,440
That is this for Facebook, but for all the things, which I find to be the most useful

341
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,480
because it color codes the tabs too.

342
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,320
So I have one tab for my JB email, one tab for my personal email, and I can do the same

343
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,880
thing with docs.

344
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,960
That's really nice.

345
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,720
And that is the multi account containers.

346
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,960
And it's one of those nice little things that keeps me on Firefox.

347
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,920
I do tend to criticize Mozilla quite a lot, but to be fair to them, they've made pretty

348
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:09,880
good strides with this containerization stuff in Firefox and Firefox does continue to improve

349
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
all the time.

350
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
So I've stuck with it all this time.

351
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,840
I'm still not a Chrome user and there's even more reason to stick with it now.

352
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,640
So well done, Mozilla.

353
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,800
The Oracle and Google case is not dead yet.

354
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:27,600
My co-host on Coder Radio described this as the tech franchise that just keeps coming

355
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,580
back into theaters.

356
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,520
And I got to say, Google, I totally told you so.

357
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,040
I hate to do it, but I told you so.

358
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,040
Yeah.

359
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,000
Where do we start with a nearly 10 year old case?

360
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,120
I mean, you've been following this since the early days of Linux Action Show, haven't you?

361
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
Yeah.

362
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,200
Really since it began, I've been following this story and it started out really clearly

363
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
in Google's favor.

364
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,960
In fact, in 2010, Oracle sued Google and the open source community exploded.

365
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,920
And Google won all their claims in 2012 and it emboldened everybody.

366
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:06,240
And it wasn't until later when Oracle appealed the claim and sent it back to the federal

367
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,240
circuit that emails were released from Andy Rubin and others within Google that clearly

368
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:20,480
showed they evaluated all available technologies and determined that Java would be best and

369
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,180
that they needed to license it.

370
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:29,200
From that moment, I knew Google had a far, far shot of winning this thing because Oracle

371
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,160
has them dead to rights in emails internally saying, we need to license this sucker.

372
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,280
And they have emails where they say, we've got to go with Java because we're behind the

373
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,920
ball on this.

374
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,360
And if we're going to catch up to Apple and the iPhone, we've got to use something that

375
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,920
has tons of developers already.

376
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,920
So we've got to use Java.

377
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,320
Yeah, but they've re-implemented most of it, didn't they?

378
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,000
It was just some of the APIs that they reused and that's what this case boils down to.

379
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yeah, exactly.

380
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,020
In 2016, actually, the second jury that looked at this whole thing found that Google's use

381
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:05,320
of the structure and sequence and the organization of 37 Java APIs was fair use.

382
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
And that's where we're at now.

383
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,880
So Oracle appealed that and this week, the Federal Circuit ruled that, yeah, Oracle's

384
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,880
right.

385
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,120
There's things in here that are clear copy and paste.

386
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,720
And there's a couple of sections early on where it appears that Google even grabbed

387
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:24,560
like the comments from the original Java source code and just copy and pasted it.

388
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,680
They cleaned it up later on, but of course, it was all published, so they did some sleuthing

389
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,480
and they found that early source code where there was line for line copies.

390
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,120
Yeah, it doesn't look good for Google.

391
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,940
I knew that this was going to be overturned a couple of years ago when the jury found

392
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,700
that it was fair use because it's not fair use, is it?

393
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:48,900
It's blatant copying of APIs which were proved to be copyrightable.

394
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,160
And it was just this idea of whether it was fair use or not.

395
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,840
And it just didn't seem like it at the time.

396
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,200
And I knew an appeal would happen and I knew it would get overturned.

397
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,600
So I think this is going to end up costing Google a lot of money.

398
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,960
And the thing is, it's not a popular thing to say that Google are going to lose and Oracle

399
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,120
are going to win this because Oracle are not a popular company within the open source community.

400
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,980
But you can't change the facts here that they are basically in the right.

401
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:21,600
And they have those emails from folks running Android at the time clearly seeing that, yeah,

402
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,320
we need to license this and Andy Rubin himself said, yeah, I did see that email.

403
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,720
So that's a tough thing to beat around.

404
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,920
I do kind of think at a larger sort of bigger picture perspective here that Google may actually

405
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,680
have a bit of a claim like this is such a common technology that you have claimed is

406
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,360
a worldwide resource like you yourselves position it as that.

407
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,880
You sort of in your own marketing justify why it is fair use for us to use these APIs.

408
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:57,000
I can see that perspective if it wasn't for the conniving right out in the clear in their

409
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,760
emails, Google may have a much better case here.

410
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,240
Yeah, well, we'll see what comes of this.

411
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,200
But to me, there has always been one very clear winner in this whole situation.

412
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
And that is the lawyers.

413
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,160
They are cleaning up on this.

414
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:17,680
Well, and for something completely different, if not a bit unexpected, Microsoft just made

415
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:23,160
it easier and open source for you to ship your own distro on top of the subsystem for

416
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
Linux.

417
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:31,740
Yeah, so before the actual code to make your Linux distro run on the subsystem was proprietary,

418
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:38,480
but now they've published an example bit of code, which really facilitates anyone who's

419
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,960
got a distro to make it run on WSL.

420
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,640
And then you can easily sideload it onto your own system.

421
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,280
But to put it out there into the public, you have to get it into the Microsoft App Store,

422
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,280
which does require them to review it and make sure that everything's working properly.

423
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,000
Yeah, you have to ask for permission to get it in the bigger App Store.

424
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,720
And I bet that's going to be pretty limited.

425
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,760
But they do make facilities available for you to load it yourself.

426
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,840
So if you are your own distro maintainer, or you knew how to make a distro that you

427
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,400
really loved work on this, you could still load it on your own instance of Windows.

428
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,820
But it's interesting that they talk about needing permission to get into the App Store.

429
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:26,300
Does that suggest that the likes of SUSE and Fedora and Kali Linux requested it themselves

430
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,900
rather than Microsoft approaching them?

431
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,920
It kind of implies that to me.

432
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:35,700
It does imply it a bit, and maybe after Ubuntu was announced, maybe that is the case.

433
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:41,400
But my initial read on all of those announcements was it was an invite, because Microsoft led

434
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,080
the announcement in those cases.

435
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,480
Yeah, I suppose so.

436
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,880
Maybe I'm just trying to cook up some conspiracy bacon there.

437
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
I like it though.

438
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
You know me.

439
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
I love some good bacon.

440
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
Yeah.

441
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,480
But do you think we're actually going to see more distros now then?

442
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,960
Do you think anyone else is interested in being on the subsystem?

443
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Yeah.

444
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Oh, I'm sure.

445
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:58,960
I bet.

446
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,120
And I think you'll also see a lot of folks just do this to their own favorite distro.

447
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,280
So say you wanted something that wasn't in there today, and they make this available

448
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,400
for you to side load it, as they put it.

449
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,400
Why not?

450
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Why not do it?

451
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,400
I would do it.

452
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,120
If I was stuck on Windows and I had to manage a bunch of Linux boxes, I'd totally do it.

453
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,560
Especially if I was like some Gentoo guy or something, and we had all these Gentoo systems.

454
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,000
Who would ever load Gentoo in production?

455
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,160
I don't know.

456
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,880
That person would have to be a crazy younger version of myself.

457
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,800
And I would totally want Gentoo in my Windows system to manage it.

458
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Yeah.

459
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,160
And I wonder if this opens the door a little bit closer to getting BSD running on it.

460
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,960
I know it's a very big technical challenge to do it, but I'm sure someone out there must

461
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,120
be trying to do it.

462
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,400
Yeah, at least one person must want that.

463
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,480
Yeah, maybe Alan wants to get it going.

464
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:48,440
Well, if Alan Jude manages to pull that off, or any other interesting things develop in

465
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,760
the open source world, and of course with Linux, we'll tell you about it right here

466
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,240
