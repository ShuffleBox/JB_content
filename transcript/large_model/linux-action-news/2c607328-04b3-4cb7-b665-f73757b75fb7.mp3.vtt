00:00.000 --> 00:09.260
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 182, recorded on March 28th, 2021.

00:09.260 --> 00:10.260
I'm Chris.

00:10.260 --> 00:11.260
And I'm Wes.

00:11.260 --> 00:12.260
Well, hey, Wes.

00:12.260 --> 00:13.260
Let's do the news.

00:13.260 --> 00:16.660
After weeks of anticipation, GNOME 40 has been released.

00:16.660 --> 00:19.700
A range of improvements came together in 40.

00:19.700 --> 00:22.100
To get the details, we went right to the source.

00:22.100 --> 00:26.720
My name is Neil McGovern, and I'm the executive director of the GNOME Foundation.

00:26.720 --> 00:30.460
And of course, we had to ask Neil what the big changes were in GNOME 40.

00:30.460 --> 00:35.960
So yeah, I guess the change that everyone's talking about is the move from the sort of

00:35.960 --> 00:39.480
vertical to horizontal in the dash in the overview.

00:39.480 --> 00:45.720
Yeah, so that certainly caused quite a few concerns when we first talked about it, but

00:45.720 --> 00:51.520
I think we've ended up with something that works really well and seems to be, that seems

00:51.520 --> 00:53.560
to have people quite excited for.

00:53.560 --> 00:59.320
The overview change is GNOME 40's biggest feature and maybe most controversial.

00:59.320 --> 01:05.440
And that's why the GNOME team was glad to have user research to back up their decision.

01:05.440 --> 01:10.280
So I asked Neil, how did those research studies impact GNOME 40's changes?

01:10.280 --> 01:16.720
So one of the things is that the overview hasn't really sort of seen the way of design

01:16.720 --> 01:20.360
updates since its introduction in 2011.

01:20.360 --> 01:25.560
And other aspects of the desktop have evolved, so we had notifications, system status, unlock

01:25.560 --> 01:28.000
login, things like that.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.960
But the overview hasn't really seen much in the way of improvements.

01:31.960 --> 01:37.000
So not only did the overview need a refresh, but there was a number of limitations in designs

01:37.000 --> 01:40.360
that kind of became apparent over the years.

01:40.360 --> 01:46.280
So things like the somewhat unhelpful blank boot state, the sort of lack of coherent touchpad

01:46.280 --> 01:53.960
gestures and, in particular, some ambiguous nature of things like the workspace switcher.

01:53.960 --> 02:02.320
So what we did is we went back through some original conversations, which started about

02:02.320 --> 02:04.080
2017.

02:04.080 --> 02:07.760
And as that design took place, a great deal of user research took place.

02:07.760 --> 02:14.820
So we included sort of exploratory interviews, surveys, user testing, diary studies.

02:14.820 --> 02:19.360
And so it is that research that sort of fed into the ongoing design work to sort of make

02:19.360 --> 02:24.080
sure that the new design is attractive to both new and existing users.

02:24.080 --> 02:29.020
And while the overview changes are the biggest user interface change, there's a lot of technical

02:29.020 --> 02:31.440
changes under the hood as well.

02:31.440 --> 02:37.680
Some of them relate more to GTK4, but some of them relate to the changes made to input.

02:37.680 --> 02:42.720
I asked Neil if moving input to its own thread will be noticeable by us end users.

02:42.720 --> 02:43.720
Yeah, absolutely.

02:43.720 --> 02:48.240
Fortunately, we've managed to pull that out.

02:48.240 --> 02:53.280
It's quite technical the way it works, but basically the Linux kernel really, really

02:53.280 --> 02:57.880
doesn't like anything interrupting when you do things with disk access.

02:57.880 --> 03:01.360
So it doesn't really care what your mouse or your keyboard is doing.

03:01.360 --> 03:06.520
If it's touching your disk a lot, then it'll just drop those vents on the side.

03:06.520 --> 03:11.400
So hopefully this helps speed up things a little bit and sort of helps us capture a

03:11.400 --> 03:13.320
bit more of that to make things smoother.

03:13.320 --> 03:18.680
Now with these technical changes and the overview changes, that means there's going to be some

03:18.680 --> 03:23.680
work for extension developers, and there's really just no way around that.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.680
And I've noticed, and something Wes and I touched on in a previous episode, the GNOME

03:27.680 --> 03:31.800
project seems to be reaching out more to shell extension developers, and I asked for some

03:31.800 --> 03:33.040
details on those efforts.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.040
Sure.

03:34.040 --> 03:37.560
So this was started by a few members of our community.

03:37.560 --> 03:41.400
It's a fairly long running initiative, I think.

03:41.400 --> 03:47.440
It's called Extensions Rebooted, and it's a collaborative effort to kind of address

03:47.440 --> 03:51.920
those issues around the GNOME shell extension ecosystem.

03:51.920 --> 03:57.320
So we wanted to make a few different policy changes and technological improvements to

03:57.320 --> 04:00.000
try and build that sustainable community.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.640
So I mean, its ultimate goal is to get the extension community to work with each other

04:03.640 --> 04:08.320
and have closer ties with GNOME shell developers and to provide documentation and tools.

04:08.320 --> 04:14.240
But no conversation around GNOME extensions goes very long until API is brought up.

04:14.240 --> 04:17.480
Somebody wants an API for GNOME extensions in every conversation.

04:17.480 --> 04:19.120
So I asked just about that.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.600
Is GNOME considering a stable API for extension developers to utilize?

04:22.600 --> 04:30.440
Well, so you have a strange duality here of there's been a lot of talk about GNOME providing

04:30.440 --> 04:37.080
an API, which is all stable, and that to make sure extensions don't break between versions.

04:37.080 --> 04:42.280
But the downside to that is that extensions just can't be as powerful as they are now.

04:42.280 --> 04:47.940
So by writing extension, you have full access and full control to all of GNOME shell.

04:47.940 --> 04:54.880
But what we're really interested in is making sure that there's proper documentation about

04:54.880 --> 05:01.560
how extensions work and doing things like providing tooling so people can find out what

05:01.560 --> 05:06.620
they need to do when a new shell version comes out and their extension needs updates because

05:06.620 --> 05:08.360
the underlying shell has changed.

05:08.360 --> 05:12.960
So that's everything from like a CI pipeline and providing a virtual machine where people

05:12.960 --> 05:18.560
can see the nightly version of GNOME to kind of really test and get more involved with

05:18.560 --> 05:22.680
GNOME upstream rather than just working somewhere else on them by themselves.

05:22.680 --> 05:26.840
And it leads one to wonder, what are the next technical challenges for GNOME?

05:26.840 --> 05:34.440
So yeah, the next kind of big thing where we're looking at is the move from a lot of

05:34.440 --> 05:39.640
the core apps into GTK4, which was just released in December.

05:39.640 --> 05:45.040
And I mean, GTK4 has been a huge, colossal multi-year development endeavor, starting

05:45.040 --> 05:49.280
I think late 2016, and it just released at the end of the year.

05:49.280 --> 05:52.280
And there's a few things that have really come in from that.

05:52.280 --> 05:59.280
So I mean, just on a pure technical point of view, there's been a lot of work like creating

05:59.280 --> 06:01.520
a new GL renderer for GTK.

06:01.520 --> 06:05.680
So the initial motivation for that was to improve rendering performance on Mac OS where

06:05.680 --> 06:11.800
the GL drivers are not as forgiving as they are on Linux, but it also gives us a chance

06:11.800 --> 06:15.180
to apply the things we've learned over our current GL render and sort of reorganize the

06:15.180 --> 06:20.200
code with the night of future improvements and such as reordering, batching of draw commands,

06:20.200 --> 06:21.200
et cetera.

06:21.200 --> 06:25.500
Now, I hate to ask this, but with all that in mind, I had to know what is in store for

06:25.500 --> 06:26.820
GNOME 41.

06:26.820 --> 06:35.080
The big move towards GTK4, I think, is going to be a real good set of things that you can

06:35.080 --> 06:36.080
get from that.

06:36.080 --> 06:41.680
And those can be, let's imagine, better graphics, harder acceleration, things like that.

06:41.680 --> 06:48.040
But also, there's some simple things in there that we can actually do with GTK4 now.

06:48.040 --> 06:55.780
So for example, pop-ups that happen when you click on a menu or something like that was

06:55.780 --> 06:59.880
always tricky because you have a little beak that sort of points to the button which you

06:59.880 --> 07:01.160
clicked on.

07:01.160 --> 07:05.800
And so now with the new positioning protocols, then quite frankly, it makes the beak point

07:05.800 --> 07:10.720
where it's meant to and also allows like shadows underneath and around the popover, which you

07:10.720 --> 07:14.820
can, and as they're window shadows, you can actually sort of click through them to go

07:14.820 --> 07:16.520
to the underlying window.

07:16.520 --> 07:24.760
Or simple things like we now have with GTK4 actually sort of accelerated smooth scrolling

07:24.760 --> 07:26.640
that has kinetic properties as well.

07:26.640 --> 07:31.200
So it just makes that experience a whole lot smoother and feels a lot more natural.

07:31.200 --> 07:37.080
And to a simple one, which I personally just love and it seems a bit odd, but it's just

07:37.080 --> 07:40.800
wonderful, is that when you have a text editor, instead of just blinking the cursor on and

07:40.800 --> 07:44.320
off, you can put a slight fade in and fade out at the end and it just makes it look so

07:44.320 --> 07:45.360
much nicer.

07:45.360 --> 07:49.480
So I think a whole lot of polish around there just to make things look and feel really good

07:49.480 --> 07:50.480
to use.

07:50.480 --> 07:54.640
Thanks to Neil McGovern for answering all our GNOME 40 questions.

07:54.640 --> 07:58.880
If you're feeling brave and want to give it a try, check out the Fedora 34 beta which

07:58.880 --> 08:00.840
was just released.

08:00.840 --> 08:06.080
And if your distribution is not upgrading to GNOME 40 just yet, don't feel left out.

08:06.080 --> 08:11.200
There's a new stable release of the GNOME 3 series, 3.38.5.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.560
It's a bug fix release with patches for numerous issues and crashes, along with support for

08:15.560 --> 08:19.960
handling monitor changes during screencasts.

08:19.960 --> 08:23.640
Sis admin or not, there comes a time when we must all update.

08:23.640 --> 08:27.360
This was one of those rare moments, though, where we got a heads up something was coming.

08:27.360 --> 08:33.400
The OpenSSL project warned us on Monday, March 22nd, that critical security fixes were forthcoming.

08:33.400 --> 08:40.900
Then on March 25th, OpenSSL version 1.1.1h was released, with a check to disallow certificates

08:40.900 --> 08:44.940
in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters.

08:44.940 --> 08:49.280
As we record, patches have landed in just about every Linux distribution, so update

08:49.280 --> 08:53.080
from your local repo today.

08:53.080 --> 08:59.120
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account and support the show.

08:59.120 --> 09:03.040
Linode makes cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.920
We use Linode for everything in JB 3.0.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.980
Just over the weekend, we were spinning up new rigs on Linode because once you start,

09:09.980 --> 09:10.980
you just can't stop.

09:10.980 --> 09:14.200
It's like potato chips, and that's why that $100 credit is great, because you can get

09:14.200 --> 09:16.680
a real sense of what you can do with Linode.

09:16.680 --> 09:20.240
There's a lot there, but it's nice, easy to use, and accessible.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.360
And with 11 data centers around the world, there's probably something close to you that's

09:23.360 --> 09:25.200
going to work really fast.

09:25.200 --> 09:29.280
Linode's been around since 2003, one of the first companies in cloud computing, three

09:29.280 --> 09:31.760
years before AWS and other enterprise providers.

09:31.760 --> 09:34.160
So they've refined this well.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.960
They really have this thing dialed in.

09:35.960 --> 09:38.080
Their SSDs are super fast.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.900
Their interconnect between their data centers is nuts, because they're their own ISP.

09:41.900 --> 09:44.640
They're truly dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

09:44.640 --> 09:47.760
If it runs on Linux, it'll run on Linode.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.160
Linode.com slash LAN.

09:50.160 --> 09:54.040
While you're there, check them out, create an account, get that $100 credit, and support

09:54.040 --> 09:55.040
the show.

09:55.040 --> 09:58.480
I often talk about Linode's fantastic support, and how they'll let you do just about anything

09:58.480 --> 10:00.720
you can that's legal with the system.

10:00.720 --> 10:04.160
I think this is really making the point this week, though.

10:04.160 --> 10:08.560
In the show notes, I'll have a document that's forked from Linode's own documentation on

10:08.560 --> 10:11.600
installing Windows on Linode.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.360
Yeah, there's actually people that want to run Windows on Linode.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.680
You never know what reasons somebody might have, and it is indeed possible.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.000
Myself, I love Linode for all the distributions they support.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.240
Arch, CentOS, Alpines, Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE, all of them.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.240
They're all on there.

10:26.240 --> 10:29.600
I mean, they really get Linux, and it shows when you start to use Linode.

10:29.600 --> 10:30.680
So go try them out.

10:30.680 --> 10:36.600
See why they're our hosting provider of choice, while we host everything for JB 3.0 on Linode,

10:36.600 --> 10:38.840
and see what they can do for you.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.540
Linode.com slash LAN.

10:41.540 --> 10:47.520
Free Software Advocate Richard Stallman is rejoining the board of the Free Software Foundation.

10:47.520 --> 10:54.200
Stallman founded the FSF in 1985 and acted as its president until 2019, when he resigned

10:54.200 --> 10:58.880
after making widely criticized statements about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.360
Stallman announced the news during LibrePlanet's livestream last week.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.720
I have an announcement to make.

11:04.720 --> 11:10.920
I'm now on the Free Software Foundation board of directors once again.

11:10.920 --> 11:18.040
We were working on a video to announce this with, but that turned out to be difficult.

11:18.040 --> 11:25.000
We didn't have experience doing that sort of thing, so it didn't get finished, but here's

11:25.000 --> 11:26.760
the announcement.

11:26.760 --> 11:32.440
Some of you will be happy at this, and some might be disappointed, but who knows?

11:32.440 --> 11:37.400
In any case, that's how it is.

11:37.400 --> 11:41.900
And I'm not planning to resign a second time.

11:41.900 --> 11:47.380
Stallman had resigned from the FSF, as well as his position at MIT, after participating

11:47.380 --> 11:51.920
in a conversation about MIT's leadership and its ties with Jeffrey Epstein.

11:51.920 --> 11:56.820
Stallman defended MIT professor Marvin Minsky, who had allegedly had sex with one of Epstein's

11:56.820 --> 12:01.640
trafficking victims, saying, quote, the most plausible scenario was that Minsky had been

12:01.640 --> 12:04.240
unaware that the woman was being coerced.

12:04.240 --> 12:08.840
For some critics, the problems went beyond that exchange, covering other statements and

12:08.840 --> 12:14.040
actions he'd made over his years in the free and open source software community.

12:14.040 --> 12:18.240
Even after his resignation, Stallman remained in charge of the GNU project.

12:18.240 --> 12:22.800
This news does not change that status, and Jeffrey Knoth remains the president of the

12:22.800 --> 12:24.200
Free Software Foundation.

12:24.200 --> 12:29.000
The major development since the news became public now is that a range of pushback about

12:29.000 --> 12:34.420
his return has come out, as well as concerns around how the voting process was conducted.

12:34.420 --> 12:39.400
An open letter by major free software projects is urging the removal of Richard Stallman

12:39.400 --> 12:42.040
and the entire FSF board.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.200
In part, the open letter states,

12:44.200 --> 12:48.920
Richard M. Stallman, frequently known as RMS, has been a dangerous force in the free software

12:48.920 --> 12:50.800
community for a long time.

12:50.800 --> 12:55.920
He has shown himself to be misogynist, ableist, and transphobic, among other serious accusations.

12:55.920 --> 13:00.320
They then go on to say, these sorts of beliefs have no place in the free software, digital

13:00.320 --> 13:02.180
rights, and tech communities.

13:02.180 --> 13:05.760
With his recent reinstatement to the board of directors of the Free Software Foundation,

13:05.760 --> 13:11.800
we call for the entire board of the FSF to step down, and for RMS to be removed from

13:11.800 --> 13:13.960
all leadership positions.

13:13.960 --> 13:18.180
Letter signers include Neil McGovern, GNOME Foundation executive director and former Debian

13:18.180 --> 13:24.100
Project leader, Deb Nicholson, general manager of the Open Source Initiative, Matthew Garrett,

13:24.100 --> 13:30.300
a former member of the FSF board of directors, all eight members of the Xorg Foundation board

13:30.300 --> 13:35.000
of directors, Elena Hashman of the Debian Technical Committee, Open Source Initiative

13:35.000 --> 13:40.840
and Kubernetes Project, Molly de Blanc of the Debian Project and GNOME Foundation, and

13:40.840 --> 13:43.560
more than 2,000 other signatures.

13:43.560 --> 13:47.520
As you might expect, an open letter in support of RMS has also been created, and it has been

13:47.520 --> 13:51.720
signed by over 3,500 individuals as of this recording.

13:51.720 --> 13:56.240
A section of their letter that gives us insight to their position states the following.

13:56.240 --> 14:01.240
Historically, RMS has been expressing his views in ways that upset many people.

14:01.240 --> 14:06.160
He is usually more focused on the philosophical underpinnings and pursuing the objective truth

14:06.160 --> 14:11.440
in linguistic purism, while under-emphasizing people's feelings on matters he's commenting

14:11.440 --> 14:12.440
on.

14:12.440 --> 14:16.800
This makes his arguments vulnerable to misunderstanding and misrepresentation, something which we

14:16.800 --> 14:20.680
feel is happening in the open letter calling for his removal.

14:20.680 --> 14:25.080
His words need to be interpreted in this context and taken into account that more often than

14:25.080 --> 14:28.440
not he's not looking to put things diplomatically.

14:28.440 --> 14:33.280
Regardless, Stallman's opinions on the matters he is being persecuted over are not relevant

14:33.280 --> 14:36.320
to his ability to lead a community such as the FSF.

14:36.320 --> 14:41.960
Furthermore, he is entitled to his opinions just as much as anyone else.

14:41.960 --> 14:45.800
Members and supporters do not have to agree with his opinions, but should respect his

14:45.800 --> 14:48.720
right to freedom of thought and speech.

14:48.720 --> 14:52.800
Having read both letters, I hear what each side is saying, and some of his defenders

14:52.800 --> 14:55.900
points might even have some legitimate merit.

14:55.900 --> 14:59.900
But this isn't one of those things that's going to go away with time.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.560
This isn't going to get better in a few months.

15:01.560 --> 15:06.560
In fact, this very reaction we are seeing right now, even a year and a half after RMS

15:06.560 --> 15:09.880
originally resigned, proves that point.

15:09.880 --> 15:13.920
People will never forget the history of things that RMS has said.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.560
They're online and documented forever.

15:16.560 --> 15:20.000
And here is the crux of the issue.

15:20.000 --> 15:26.360
The Free Software Foundation is an establishment of ideas, which they would claim are moral

15:26.360 --> 15:27.680
ideas.

15:27.680 --> 15:32.160
The public's reaction and memory to all of this is totally incompatible with the Free

15:32.160 --> 15:36.800
Software Foundation's mission to campaign against threats to computer user freedom and

15:36.800 --> 15:38.760
their other stated goals.

15:38.760 --> 15:43.120
To truly win that campaign, they must provide moral leadership to all of society, and they

15:43.120 --> 15:49.160
must do so effectively, regardless of anyone's personal opinion about RMS and what he has

15:49.160 --> 15:50.160
said.

15:50.160 --> 15:56.560
The effectiveness of the FSF will be limited by the situation, limited in many ways from

15:56.560 --> 15:59.040
mindshare to community.

15:59.040 --> 16:03.960
And I suspect nothing short of a full board change will actually make those who are concerned

16:03.960 --> 16:07.760
about all this trust the FSF again.

16:07.760 --> 16:13.000
The reality is the human aspects of creating software eventually become the hardest aspects

16:13.000 --> 16:14.200
to manage.

16:14.200 --> 16:18.120
And if the world truly needs saving like RMS says it does, then perhaps he should reflect

16:18.120 --> 16:26.120
on the wise words of Batman.

16:26.120 --> 16:31.120
Or put another way, the steady progress of time inevitably brings a shift in the way

16:31.120 --> 16:33.480
and what society values.

16:33.480 --> 16:38.920
The FSF was not immediately available to provide comment on Stallman's return or what role

16:38.920 --> 16:41.080
he will play on the board.

16:41.080 --> 16:45.360
We'll keep an eye on this story, and you'll find extensive links at linuxactionnews.com

16:45.360 --> 16:48.480
slash 182.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.720
Linux dot ting dot com.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.560
New plans, same great service.

16:51.560 --> 16:55.840
And I can tell you friends, a good family plan is hard to find, but Ting's new flex

16:55.840 --> 17:01.440
plan addresses that particular pain point in a very customer friendly way.

17:01.440 --> 17:04.840
You can add as many lines on your account as you need, just ten dollars per line.

17:04.840 --> 17:09.120
Every line has unlimited texting calls, and every line shares the same pool of data.

17:09.120 --> 17:11.940
Then you just pay five dollars per gigabyte of data needed.

17:11.940 --> 17:16.320
But if you need two gigs or 20 gigs or more, there's a perfect Ting plan for you.

17:16.320 --> 17:21.800
Every Ting plan gets access to Ting's award winning customer service with nationwide LTE

17:21.800 --> 17:26.400
and 5G coverage, plus the freedom of no contracts ever.

17:26.400 --> 17:30.080
And the thing that's great about Ting is you have three fantastic networks to choose

17:30.080 --> 17:31.080
from.

17:31.080 --> 17:34.480
I like Verizon these days, but there's several you can pick, and it's simple to switch

17:34.480 --> 17:35.480
to Ting.

17:35.480 --> 17:38.380
Pretty much any phone works on Ting with all those networks.

17:38.380 --> 17:41.160
So just head to linux.ting.com.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.640
Check out your current phone, see if it works, create an account and pick the plan that's

17:44.640 --> 17:45.640
right for you.

17:45.640 --> 17:49.480
When you go to linux.ting.com, you're going to get $25 off to work with.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.820
That might pay for your entire first month.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.280
That's what a great deal Ting is.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.720
Ting will just send you a SIM card and you pop that in and you are good to go.

17:56.720 --> 18:01.480
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier with Ting's new plans.

18:01.480 --> 18:04.260
Get everything you need at linux.ting.com.

18:04.260 --> 18:09.360
I can tell you as a long time customer, it's great and there has never been a better time

18:09.360 --> 18:11.760
to try Ting than right now.

18:11.760 --> 18:17.000
Bring your phone and get $25 off at linux.ting.com.

18:17.000 --> 18:22.600
It caught our attention this week when the new CEO of Qualcomm said the current global

18:22.600 --> 18:28.000
chip shortage might not end until late 2021.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.600
So we wanted to bring you up to date and tell you how this might impact the Linux ecosystem.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.840
How did this all start?

18:35.840 --> 18:37.840
In short, COVID-19.

18:37.840 --> 18:42.440
Obviously, supply chain shutdowns from the pandemic are going to play a role here.

18:42.440 --> 18:44.200
That has a knock-on effect.

18:44.200 --> 18:47.560
But additionally, sales are up across the board.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.800
Anything that has a chip in it, it's selling more of right now.

18:50.800 --> 18:55.960
People are upgrading their gear and CNBC's business news reporter, Kith Leswing, put

18:55.960 --> 18:56.960
it this way.

18:56.960 --> 19:03.520
So what became very clear is that, you know, there was a supply chain disruption, but one

19:03.520 --> 19:07.640
step kind of started working its way through in the summer and China started getting back

19:07.640 --> 19:13.360
to work, but trust companies knew that they needed to increase production by a lot.

19:13.360 --> 19:17.000
And there is no sign sales are slowing.

19:17.000 --> 19:26.120
Global semiconductor sales have grown from $412 billion in 2019 to $439 billion in 2020.

19:26.120 --> 19:30.160
Car manufacturers are some of the hardest hit, but this is a problem throughout the

19:30.160 --> 19:31.680
tech sector.

19:31.680 --> 19:37.720
How quickly things get back to normal depends on the planning companies did before the lockdowns,

19:37.720 --> 19:40.560
at least according to Daniel Newman, research analyst.

19:40.560 --> 19:43.560
It sort of depended on the stockpiling that these different companies did.

19:43.560 --> 19:44.560
You know, I mentioned Toyota.

19:44.560 --> 19:49.880
Toyota's in better shape, had stockpiled more, where other companies, when they cut their

19:49.880 --> 19:54.800
forecasts, cut their, you know, manufacturing for periods of time, and now they're waiting

19:54.800 --> 19:56.280
in the back of the line.

19:56.280 --> 20:00.760
So we wanted to take the temperature of the Linux ecosystem and contacted System76's

20:00.760 --> 20:06.160
CEO Carl Rochelle on how the shortage is impacting their systems born to run Linux.

20:06.160 --> 20:10.520
And Carl wrote in with this, he says, chip supply constraints have caused procurement

20:10.520 --> 20:14.200
issues for motherboards, CPUs, and GPUs.

20:14.200 --> 20:18.540
We've adjusted our purchasing strategy and hold more in stock in an attempt to even out

20:18.540 --> 20:20.460
supply for our customers.

20:20.460 --> 20:24.000
Even with that, it is a challenging environment.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.760
Carl goes on to note that their new AMD laptop, the Pangolin, sold out faster than anticipated

20:28.760 --> 20:35.120
and AMD CPU supply is too tight for them to provide even estimates for new stock arrivals.

20:35.120 --> 20:37.920
GPUs are a nightmare, Carl says.

20:37.920 --> 20:42.200
Tariffs and demand are pushing up prices and forcing OEMs to speculate in the GPU market

20:42.200 --> 20:47.200
just as much as everyone else, particularly with Nvidia chips.

20:47.200 --> 20:52.760
Both AMD and Nvidia are beginning to loosen up, but that's starting from an extremely

20:52.760 --> 20:55.360
tight supply situation to begin with.

20:55.360 --> 20:59.000
Carl goes on to say, well, I suppose we're happy that we're getting the tiny amount of

20:59.000 --> 21:02.520
stock at all because it's absolutely better than nothing.

21:02.520 --> 21:07.420
He says that they anticipate at least another six months of challenging supply.

21:07.420 --> 21:12.000
And in general, it means fewer options for the entire Linux ecosystem until the supply

21:12.000 --> 21:14.780
chain can catch up with demand.

21:14.780 --> 21:20.920
Not an easy situation to deal with, but I have faith they'll eventually figure it out.

21:20.920 --> 21:25.880
And it just makes me look forward to our tips for getting the best performance out of Linux

21:25.880 --> 21:26.880
in the future.

21:26.880 --> 21:27.880
Linux Unplugged.

21:27.880 --> 21:28.880
Absolutely.

21:28.880 --> 21:34.080
You'd be surprised the kind of kick you can get out of an old machine with the right tweaks.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.080
But we'll be back next week.

21:35.080 --> 21:39.120
