00:00.000 --> 00:10.160
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 111, recorded on June 23rd, 2019. I'm Chris.

00:10.160 --> 00:11.160
And I'm Joe.

00:11.160 --> 00:16.160
Hello, Joe. We start out this week with a story that is getting a lot of discussion

00:16.160 --> 00:22.360
online, and that is Ubuntu's plan to drop i386 support in 1910.

00:22.360 --> 00:27.800
Yeah, this has been a long time coming. They've been discussing this for well over a year,

00:27.800 --> 00:34.120
and now is the time to do it before the LTS. It's going to be dropped in 1910 in preparation

00:34.120 --> 00:40.000
for the first LTS 2004 that will just have no i386 support at all.

00:40.000 --> 00:45.920
Yeah, the post on the Canonical Discourse site reads, the Ubuntu engineering team has

00:45.920 --> 00:52.800
reviewed the facts before us and concluded that we should not continue to carry the i386

00:52.800 --> 00:59.880
support forward. Consequently, i386 will not be included as an architecture for 1910 release,

00:59.880 --> 01:06.040
and will shortly begin the process of disabling it for the series across the Ubuntu infrastructure.

01:06.040 --> 01:09.380
And they go on, and this is the part that really caught a lot of attention. While this

01:09.380 --> 01:14.860
means we will not provide 32-bit builds of new upstream versions of libraries, there

01:14.860 --> 01:19.560
are a number of ways that 32-bit applications can continue to be made available to users

01:19.560 --> 01:21.120
in later Ubuntu releases.

01:21.120 --> 01:26.120
Well, virtualization being the obvious one, and potentially Flatpak and Snaps.

01:26.120 --> 01:31.240
Even a chroot of the 1804 libraries, because 1804, it has many years of support ahead of

01:31.240 --> 01:32.240
it.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.560
Yeah, another four years, which should be enough time, hopefully, to migrate away from

01:35.560 --> 01:38.920
the various applications that are still using 32-bit components.

01:38.920 --> 01:42.680
I mean, this is a thing that's happening. We've been talking about it for a year on

01:42.680 --> 01:47.640
this show. OpenMandriva also announced this week their plans to drop the 32-bit release

01:47.640 --> 01:51.880
in sort of a transitionary method. What are your thoughts on this, Joe? I mean, it kind

01:51.880 --> 01:58.240
of feels like this is the future in a way. This story made me realize, I'm an old man,

01:58.240 --> 02:04.120
by the way, because I have been here for the transition from 8-bit to 16-bit to 32-bit,

02:04.120 --> 02:08.800
and now I'm watching the 64-bit transition. And this one seems like the sloppiest of all.

02:08.800 --> 02:13.960
It does seem to be a very painful transition, definitely. It's been dragged out for many

02:13.960 --> 02:18.720
years at this point. I think the way that Canonical have done this with Ubuntu has made

02:18.720 --> 02:24.580
a lot of sense. They, first of all, dropped the ISO images, and they stopped automatically

02:24.580 --> 02:31.880
upgrading people to 1904 in preparation, really, for an inevitable eventuality. And that is

02:31.880 --> 02:40.080
that they can't just keep building that 32-bit i386 repo because of all the QA testing security

02:40.080 --> 02:41.080
issues that come with it.

02:41.080 --> 02:45.040
Well, and think about it from the Canonical developers' position. Once you make an announcement

02:45.040 --> 02:49.640
like this, you still have to wait for all of the production-supported systems to work

02:49.640 --> 02:55.940
their way out. So if you think about it, that would be 1404, 1604, and obviously 1804 all

02:55.940 --> 03:01.280
have years of support left. So they will have to continue to maintain these libraries even

03:01.280 --> 03:07.080
after this announcement and this release is final. So it's long-term planning.

03:07.080 --> 03:11.440
Yeah, you might have to pay to get some of those, like 1404, but yeah, that will be supported

03:11.440 --> 03:18.760
potentially for another few years still. So this is extremely long-term planning from

03:18.760 --> 03:22.480
them. And they have to draw a line at some point, don't they?

03:22.480 --> 03:28.400
It does seem inevitable as the steady progress of time marches on. And I would not be surprised

03:28.400 --> 03:33.280
if other distributions start having this same conversation in the next year or so. It may

03:33.280 --> 03:38.720
be the number one conversation over the next year. And oftentimes, Canonical and Ubuntu

03:38.720 --> 03:44.720
are kind of at the forefront of these kinds of decisions. I think of Mir and Upstart.

03:44.720 --> 03:49.440
They weren't really popular decisions, but let's be frank. When they decided to choose

03:49.440 --> 03:54.640
Mir, development on Wayland was going nowhere. It wasn't until they committed to Mir that

03:54.640 --> 04:01.400
Wayland picked up. And to be honest with you, Joe, the same is really true for Snaps. Flatpaks

04:01.400 --> 04:06.160
weren't even called Flatpaks then. XGG Apps, I think is what they were called. And they

04:06.160 --> 04:10.920
were going nowhere until Snaps were announced. I kind of think the reality is the same here

04:10.920 --> 04:13.960
for this transition from i386 support.

04:13.960 --> 04:18.600
Well, it took a few days, but the community did react to this. And it turns out that there

04:18.600 --> 04:25.140
are quite a few, not even that niche cases, that still need some 32-bit libraries and

04:25.140 --> 04:29.160
components to work properly, specifically Steam and Wine.

04:29.160 --> 04:33.960
Yeah, you're right, Joe. 32-bit is alive and well in the gaming world. In fact, friend

04:33.960 --> 04:38.520
of the show Popey, Canonical employee, did a little testing of his own and the results

04:38.520 --> 04:45.520
were pretty much miss, not so much hit. A lot of things depend on those 32-bit libraries.

04:45.520 --> 04:50.000
I'm not telling anybody anything they don't know that's ever attempted to get kind of

04:50.000 --> 04:54.140
any sort of gaming setup on Linux. You really have to get all of those libraries installed

04:54.140 --> 04:58.160
for it to work properly. But does that mean it should always be that way?

04:58.160 --> 05:04.400
Well, hopefully not. Hopefully, this is going to be the impetus to push forward development

05:04.400 --> 05:10.600
and move into the 21st century and stop using i386. And we do have to stress that this is

05:10.600 --> 05:15.960
32-bit x86 we're talking about. It's nothing to do with ARM 32-bit, which is still going

05:15.960 --> 05:17.560
strong and probably will be for a while.

05:17.560 --> 05:21.280
Yeah, you're right. It's kind of funny we have to make that disclosure now. ARM 32-bit

05:21.280 --> 05:27.960
is fine, guys. It's fine. It's fine. But really, I'm a little disappointed because there has

05:27.960 --> 05:33.840
been a significant backlash to this announcement. It really kind of kicked off when that Valve

05:33.840 --> 05:38.400
developer tweeted that they're dropping support for Ubuntu going forward. And then from there,

05:38.400 --> 05:41.560
you had a change.org petition that people started signing.

05:41.560 --> 05:42.560
Yeah.

05:42.560 --> 05:49.000
I know. I don't know. I mean, I don't even think it's broke 200 people yet. But it really,

05:49.000 --> 05:55.000
it started to stoke the internet outrage machine. And I'm a little disappointed because you

05:55.000 --> 06:00.120
can see different Canonical employees immediately beginning to backtrack now. And now Canonical

06:00.120 --> 06:06.760
is repositioning this as like a firm thing we're doing. And now it's a, hey, it's a proposal.

06:06.760 --> 06:11.040
And it's not out yet. And we may change things. Guys, calm down.

06:11.040 --> 06:15.720
Yeah, it's funny. There was a decision that had been made. And then now they're talking

06:15.720 --> 06:20.680
about it as a proposal. And that is, well, you could say it's them listening to feedback

06:20.680 --> 06:26.720
or dealing with the backlash. But this whole backlash has happened at the weekend. So we'll

06:26.720 --> 06:32.080
have to see in this coming week how this is dealt with and whether they do officially

06:32.080 --> 06:36.880
backtrack on it or whether they double down and say, look, if it means you moving off

06:36.880 --> 06:41.560
to another distro, so be it. This is what we're doing. We've made a decision. And we're

06:41.560 --> 06:42.560
going to stick with it.

06:42.560 --> 06:48.840
Yeah, the timeline is not great here. So the announcement is made on Tuesday. And the language

06:48.840 --> 06:54.340
is strong. You know, we're doing this thing. This is how it's going to be. And that happens

06:54.340 --> 07:00.280
on Tuesday. The internet doesn't care. Nothing happens, apparently. But then on Friday, a

07:00.280 --> 07:04.680
Valve developer tweets that they're dropping support. And the internet outrage machine

07:04.680 --> 07:09.240
goes into overdrive while all of the Canonical employees are, you know, having themselves

07:09.240 --> 07:13.480
a weekend. It's its worst case scenario in a PR event here.

07:13.480 --> 07:17.920
Well, I really do hope they don't backtrack on this. It's been difficult for the Canonical

07:17.920 --> 07:22.940
employees basically on their free time trying to deal with this. But presumably, on Monday

07:22.940 --> 07:27.760
morning, when they actually get together and discuss this, there will be a decision made

07:27.760 --> 07:32.780
and maybe some sort of public statement about it. And I really hope that they do just double

07:32.780 --> 07:37.760
down it and say, look, we are pushing forward for once. We're not going to just cave into

07:37.760 --> 07:39.460
this outrage culture.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.640
That would be great. I don't think that's what's going to happen. They're going to come

07:42.640 --> 07:48.280
up with some sort of solution that involves just moving the 1804 maintain libraries forward

07:48.280 --> 07:54.620
to 1910. And yeah, that's great. I think at the end of the day, I'm pretty disappointed.

07:54.620 --> 08:01.740
I think watching this entire discussion happen has made me realize that Canonical and Linux

08:01.740 --> 08:06.160
project development in general, open source project development, really, in general, is

08:06.160 --> 08:11.620
really subjective to outrage development. You start down a path, the internet freaks

08:11.620 --> 08:17.500
out, and you turn to something that's less objectionable by the outraged Twitter groups.

08:17.500 --> 08:21.600
And we all kind of suffer in the long term. We don't make the dramatic progress that we

08:21.600 --> 08:26.480
really need. We make a compromised progress. And the rest of the end users, the silent

08:26.480 --> 08:32.280
majority suffer. We don't get the real change we need. We get some sort of compromised end

08:32.280 --> 08:36.680
product that satisfies the people that are upset over the weekend.

08:36.680 --> 08:41.840
But isn't that kind of the point of open source development? Whereas, if you take something

08:41.840 --> 08:48.160
like Mac OS dropping 32-bit support, that will have happened internally, the discussion.

08:48.160 --> 08:52.800
Whereas, because this is open source, the discussion happens externally out in public.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.480
And isn't that a good thing?

08:54.480 --> 08:57.760
That's complicated. I think what you need is you need the public discussion because there

08:57.760 --> 09:03.680
has been a lot of good points made online on Twitter and various different outlets that

09:03.680 --> 09:08.480
are worth considering that Canonical should reflect on. At the same time, you have to

09:08.480 --> 09:14.360
have people that are really committed to a vision that won't just cave to the outrage,

09:14.360 --> 09:18.940
that are willing to see the big picture through. You got to have a balance there.

09:18.940 --> 09:23.360
You do have to have a balance. And it's probably better for people to have the discussion in

09:23.360 --> 09:28.340
the correct place. And just ranting on Twitter probably isn't the correct place for that.

09:28.340 --> 09:33.840
In a calm discussion on the proper mailing list or on their discourse forum or whatever,

09:33.840 --> 09:36.840
that would seem to me to be the correct place to do it.

09:36.840 --> 09:41.760
I would love to see a rational, technological discussion around this. Imagine if all of

09:41.760 --> 09:46.040
that energy had gone into coming up with a solution around this. Because every single

09:46.040 --> 09:50.360
distribution is about to face this problem. So what if we came up with a way to solve

09:50.360 --> 09:55.120
this? Maybe it's just the Steam runtime gets more libraries. Or maybe we double down on

09:55.120 --> 10:00.640
a Flatpak or Snap solution. But what if, as a community, we took this opportunity to come

10:00.640 --> 10:06.480
up with a cross-distribution solution to this problem? Solace has tried it. There's a Flatpak

10:06.480 --> 10:10.880
that tries this. There's a Snap that tries to solve this problem. Everybody has a solution

10:10.880 --> 10:15.600
to this. What if, just for a moment, we took all of this upset and outrage at Canonical

10:15.600 --> 10:19.900
and we said, you know what? They're trying to solve a problem we all face. How can we

10:19.900 --> 10:26.800
solve this? That would be such an appropriate focus and use of everyone's energy. Instead,

10:26.800 --> 10:31.480
we get silly things like change.org partitions, and we get silly outrage on Twitter, and we

10:31.480 --> 10:36.580
get silly hot takes here and there. People don't even give it three days to settle and

10:36.580 --> 10:37.580
marinate.

10:37.580 --> 10:41.720
Well, they have to get their outrage out in time to build another video editor, right?

10:41.720 --> 10:45.000
Yeah, let's launch a crowd funder too, Jim.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.080
A petition to make another great video editor for Linux. That's what we need.

10:50.080 --> 10:53.960
That'll solve it. Well, in the meantime, the rest of the press is all writing about these

10:53.960 --> 10:58.400
outrageous security vulnerabilities that affect both Linux and FreeBSD.

10:58.400 --> 11:02.940
Yeah, this is something called SAC Panic, which has been dubbed the new ping of death.

11:02.940 --> 11:10.080
What's really happening here is the way the OS handles these SACs. A SAC is a TCP Selective

11:10.080 --> 11:14.520
Acknowledgement, and there's various different ways the kernel can respond to these. And

11:14.520 --> 11:21.080
in this particular and the other vulnerability that's happening here, CVE-2019-11478, the

11:21.080 --> 11:25.600
operating system does not handle that kind of traffic very well, both in the case of

11:25.600 --> 11:30.440
FreeBSD and Linux. And what essentially happens is the operating system becomes completely

11:30.440 --> 11:35.640
consumed handling these types of TCP packets and can't respond to other services like,

11:35.640 --> 11:37.920
you know, a web request.

11:37.920 --> 11:40.200
And this is not exactly a new issue, is it?

11:40.200 --> 11:44.840
No, that might even be the part that really kind of makes this a story. This flaw goes

11:44.840 --> 11:52.880
as far back, at least as far as Linux is concerned, it goes back to kernel 2.6.29. So that's a

11:52.880 --> 11:54.160
lot of kernels, Joe.

11:54.160 --> 11:59.440
Yeah, and never before has Alan Jude's advice of patch your system, I think that's what

11:59.440 --> 12:00.440
he's saying.

12:00.440 --> 12:01.440
Your stuff, your stuff.

12:01.440 --> 12:06.800
Oh, your stuff. That's it, yeah. Never before has that advice been so relevant. The patches

12:06.800 --> 12:11.240
are there, but you have to apply them. And if you're not using a live kernel patch, then

12:11.240 --> 12:17.880
it means a reboot. But I think some of these kernel flaws, you know, take it or leave it,

12:17.880 --> 12:24.280
it's not really that important to reboot immediately. But with this one, I was just on it, rebooting

12:24.280 --> 12:25.280
everything immediately.

12:25.280 --> 12:30.380
Yeah, yeah. I mean, in total, we're really talking three different flaws that could be

12:30.380 --> 12:35.680
found in the Linux kernel's handling of TCP networking. That, to me, definitely registers

12:35.680 --> 12:40.280
as a worth it. And the most severe vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to trigger a

12:40.280 --> 12:45.280
kernel panic, and nobody wants their system to go down. So it's worth updating on this

12:45.280 --> 12:46.280
one.

12:46.280 --> 12:50.920
Well, this was the week that Slack did a very successful IPO. But I noticed that Mattermost,

12:50.920 --> 12:57.000
which is the kind of open source alternative to Slack, raised quite a lot of VC funding.

12:57.000 --> 13:03.060
This is the story that did not get very much reporting in the wake of Slack's big IPO,

13:03.060 --> 13:09.880
but Mattermost raised $50 million. And that's not all, really. This is their latest round

13:09.880 --> 13:15.680
of funding. It brings their total raised money to $70 million to build a Slack competitor.

13:15.680 --> 13:19.720
Now, I've been aware of Mattermost for quite a long time, but I'd never actually tried

13:19.720 --> 13:25.840
it out. But this inspired me to spin it up on a digital ocean droplet. And I must say,

13:25.840 --> 13:32.160
I was very impressed with it. It seems very much like Slack, but missing a few of the

13:32.160 --> 13:36.920
features. But I suppose you could say it's focused on the features that you need rather

13:36.920 --> 13:42.880
than some of the bloat that Slack might have. And I could seriously see myself and a team

13:42.880 --> 13:49.400
using it, self-hosted, open source. I mean, there are obviously the enterprise versions

13:49.400 --> 13:53.840
that have some added features, mostly around compliance and stuff. But I could definitely

13:53.840 --> 13:57.800
see running this self-hosted version, certainly with a smallish team.

13:57.800 --> 14:01.840
Yeah, you and me and a few others gave it a go this weekend for this story so that we

14:01.840 --> 14:07.260
could have some experience with Mattermost. And I think we all walked away fairly impressed.

14:07.260 --> 14:11.040
If you're a Slack free user today, I really don't think there's any reason you couldn't

14:11.040 --> 14:15.000
switch over to Mattermost immediately. Now, if you're not familiar, it's a startup that

14:15.000 --> 14:21.520
characterizes itself as an open source messaging alternative to not just Slack, but also Microsoft

14:21.520 --> 14:27.280
Teams or Atlassian HipChat, those kinds of enterprise chat softwares. And along with

14:27.280 --> 14:31.640
the announcement of the money, there's also some changes in the Mattermost board. Most

14:31.640 --> 14:36.960
significantly, the Twitter COO will join the Mattermost board as a director.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.180
And there's also some good news that comes along with the fundraising. The project has

14:40.180 --> 14:47.120
grown to 10,000 independent downloads a month and 1,000 unique contributors to the project.

14:47.120 --> 14:51.960
Much of that in translation, admittedly. But it's kind of nice to see the project grow.

14:51.960 --> 14:56.920
We tried it out and we both walked away with, huh, you know what? Better than I expected.

14:56.920 --> 15:01.120
I thought you'd have to like set up a matrix system and get a riot IM on top of that and

15:01.120 --> 15:05.080
really build something out to get something competitive with Slack. But with Mattermost,

15:05.080 --> 15:08.760
you stand it up in a few minutes, I assume, and you're good to go. I'm kind of curious,

15:08.760 --> 15:12.640
Joe, how long did it take you to get a Mattermost instance running?

15:12.640 --> 15:16.560
Well, the documentation was really good. And yeah, it only took a few minutes to get the

15:16.560 --> 15:23.520
initial system up. And then only a few more minutes really to get the NGINX proxy going.

15:23.520 --> 15:29.320
And I got my let's encrypt sorted out. And so yeah, total, probably less than an hour

15:29.320 --> 15:34.720
of working on it. But now I've done it once, I think I could spin it up on another instance

15:34.720 --> 15:35.920
much more quickly.

15:35.920 --> 15:40.560
Well, their CEO says that this is going to accelerate their growth and their community.

15:40.560 --> 15:48.440
They plan to go from 65 employees to 110 employees by 2020. They're going to like go at Slack

15:48.440 --> 15:53.800
like full on, full force now. And having seen it, I've not only tried it out with your instance,

15:53.800 --> 15:59.280
but also the Pop OS community is using Mattermost. I honestly think it's better than Slack free.

15:59.280 --> 16:04.560
And if we were starting today, I would just use this. And if I was an open source project,

16:04.560 --> 16:10.040
creating a distribution or a project that was being consumed by open source enthusiasts,

16:10.040 --> 16:15.160
the Mattermost just be 100% the way I go. I mean, IRC rooms are great. Absolutely. I'd

16:15.160 --> 16:19.760
probably have one of those too. But I wouldn't do a forum anymore. I wouldn't do a free Slack,

16:19.760 --> 16:25.000
I would just stand up a Mattermost instance. And I think it would be really successful.

16:25.000 --> 16:31.640
They also have apps for Windows, Linux, the Mac, Android, iOS, as well as a web application.

16:31.640 --> 16:37.560
Yeah, I tried out the Android app. And it was pretty much on a par with Slack. The only

16:37.560 --> 16:41.960
issue I had was that the notifications don't actually tell you what the message is. It

16:41.960 --> 16:45.760
just tells you that, you know, Chris has sent a message or whatever. So then you have to

16:45.760 --> 16:46.760
open the app.

16:46.760 --> 16:47.760
That's how I like it.

16:47.760 --> 16:48.760
Like a bit of mystery.

16:48.760 --> 16:53.440
Yeah, read my message. It's a mystery. Yeah, I tried out the Linux desktop app. It's you

16:53.440 --> 16:58.640
know, it's a it's a wrapper around the web application. But you get, you know, system

16:58.640 --> 17:02.400
trays, and you get notifications, and you can have multiple instances. So it's it's

17:02.400 --> 17:07.800
not bad. But it's a web app. It's a web app in a desktop application. But you know, they're

17:07.800 --> 17:12.000
making a Linux version available. And it does integrate. So I can't complain.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.200
Yeah, it's definitely one to watch. But it seems that something that we won't be watching

17:16.200 --> 17:18.380
is any more Google tablets.

17:18.380 --> 17:23.280
As a longtime Android on tablets enthusiast, which I thought it did better at I got the

17:23.280 --> 17:28.580
Samsung tab, I obviously got the Nexus seven, I thought it was great. I'm a little sad to

17:28.580 --> 17:33.160
see this news. But if Google's going to focus on a singular OS, especially one around the

17:33.160 --> 17:39.520
laptop form factor, Chrome OS is definitely the OS to just focus on I, I really, really

17:39.520 --> 17:44.620
wanted a pixel slate, but the reviews were so bad. It seems so so early, it seemed like

17:44.620 --> 17:52.220
a product that lacked focus from its developers from from the makers. I hate to see this at

17:52.220 --> 17:56.360
the same time, they need to pick a horse and they just need to try to win a race. The iPad

17:56.360 --> 17:58.720
Pro is so far ahead right now.

17:58.720 --> 18:04.040
Well, that's the elephant in the room here, isn't it that the iPad Pro is very expensive,

18:04.040 --> 18:10.400
but it is the class leader in that space. You could argue that maybe the surface devices

18:10.400 --> 18:15.720
that Microsoft have got are competing there. That's kind of mostly an enterprise and stuff.

18:15.720 --> 18:16.720
But

18:16.720 --> 18:20.780
I kind of disagree there, Joe, with this change, I feel like Google is going more head to head

18:20.780 --> 18:21.780
with the surface.

18:21.780 --> 18:27.880
Well, yeah, I suppose. And they're basically just leaving that tablet market to Apple now,

18:27.880 --> 18:34.560
and just accepting defeat there, really. Because initially, they dropped Android on their own

18:34.560 --> 18:38.680
tablets and tried to go for Chrome OS, but it just it doesn't make sense on that form

18:38.680 --> 18:43.920
factor. Whereas the pixel book form factor, which is essentially a convertible laptop

18:43.920 --> 18:48.760
that you can fold all the way around into a tablet, kind of splits the difference gives

18:48.760 --> 18:56.440
you the best of both worlds. But without the keyboard attachment, that pixel slate just

18:56.440 --> 19:01.920
didn't make any sense at all. And because that keyboard wasn't really good enough. That's

19:01.920 --> 19:08.160
probably why it didn't take off. So I'm not hugely surprised by this, really. But it's

19:08.160 --> 19:13.920
just a bit sad that there will be OEMs like Samsung and stuff making tablets still.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.520
Yeah, they'll keep going. They could go with the open source version of Android.

19:17.520 --> 19:22.080
Well, yeah. And you know, Android, you can just run kind of phone Android on a slightly

19:22.080 --> 19:27.360
bigger screen. But it just doesn't have that traction, the app ecosystem that Apple has.

19:27.360 --> 19:31.440
That's the thing you need those applications, you got to have the app developers on board.

19:31.440 --> 19:36.760
Yeah. Well, unless like me, I recently bought a Galaxy Tab S2, I think it's called and put

19:36.760 --> 19:42.580
lineage on it. And that's the only a small, I think, an eight inch, four by three aspect

19:42.580 --> 19:45.840
ratio one. And that I use for reading news and stuff.

19:45.840 --> 19:50.720
It's a great size. I love the seven inch that my Nexus seven is my favorite tablet. I have

19:50.720 --> 19:56.200
an iPad Pro now. It's a great, it's a great tablet. It's so fast. But my favorite tablet

19:56.200 --> 19:58.360
was the Nexus seven, I could put it in my coat pocket.

19:58.360 --> 20:05.000
Yeah, I can do that somewhat with this Galaxy Tab S2. But really, I just have it set up

20:05.000 --> 20:09.840
very much like my phone. It's just a bigger, easier to read phone, really. I think when

20:09.840 --> 20:15.240
you get into the 10 inch plus, that's when you really need to have a UI that's based

20:15.240 --> 20:20.240
around it. And that's why we're going to see iPad OS shortly, which is really just iOS

20:20.240 --> 20:25.320
with a few extra features. And you need to have the apps that can take advantage of that

20:25.320 --> 20:31.520
bigger form factor. And I think that Android is just lost in this space, unfortunately,

20:31.520 --> 20:36.320
and Chrome OS never really got started. So yeah, it's kind of sad.

20:36.320 --> 20:41.640
I kind of agree. I think at least immediately, that's true. Long term, Google is making a

20:41.640 --> 20:49.440
lot of wins with the Google Apps integration with companies. And I think that sells Chromebooks

20:49.440 --> 20:53.360
right there. I think they have a good long term strategy. And if they can get behind

20:53.360 --> 20:58.200
one product like this, which has often been a criticism of Google, they could be really

20:58.200 --> 21:02.360
successful. I'd love to see them bring something that's Linux based as a competition to the

21:02.360 --> 21:06.880
iPad because right now, I'm using the iPad Pro because it's the best product. But if

21:06.880 --> 21:14.280
I could buy a Google Linux based device that would be better, hmm, I may consider it then

21:14.280 --> 21:19.280
it would really come down to the privacy stuff. You know, that little detail that nobody has

21:19.280 --> 21:24.600
to worry about with Libra coin, that rumor we talked about last week, Joe, turns out

21:24.600 --> 21:25.600
it's a real thing.

21:25.600 --> 21:29.560
Yeah, it turns out those rumors were completely true. And it was officially announced this

21:29.560 --> 21:33.960
week. And we've got a link in the show notes to a Verge article that then has a bunch of

21:33.960 --> 21:39.920
links to way more articles if you really want to get in depth with this. But I think because

21:39.920 --> 21:44.080
those rumors were pretty much spot on, we didn't learn a huge amount.

21:44.080 --> 21:48.840
Yeah, I agree. What we kind of learned, if anything was the rollout plan. At launch,

21:48.840 --> 21:53.960
you'll be able to send Libra inside of Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, surprise, surprise.

21:53.960 --> 22:00.360
And then, for the most part, it'll be initially used as a way to take Facebook money and convert

22:00.360 --> 22:05.440
it to real money. But eventually, like the long term plan that Facebook has, is they

22:05.440 --> 22:10.320
hope that Libra will be accepted as a form of payment, and maybe other financial services

22:10.320 --> 22:18.080
that they can build on top of some sort of service. They have, quote, plans long term

22:18.080 --> 22:24.080
port to transform the global economy, end quote.

22:24.080 --> 22:31.280
Well, global is the key issue here. This is not aimed at us in Europe and America. This

22:31.280 --> 22:36.920
is aimed at developing nations where people are using these phone based payment systems,

22:36.920 --> 22:39.240
and it's really looking to compete with those.

22:39.240 --> 22:43.680
I agree. I completely agree. That's where the story is really going to get interesting

22:43.680 --> 22:49.860
long term. Anyone who has followed the cryptocurrencies and blockchain for a while now has been just

22:49.860 --> 22:54.480
kind of sitting back and waiting for some large corporation to take advantage of what

22:54.480 --> 22:59.440
is essentially a gift of the riches. If you can really pull this off, you make your own

22:59.440 --> 23:05.760
currency and you make it math based and you follow the right kind of protocols and procedures,

23:05.760 --> 23:11.920
you can have a hit. And I think any of us cryptocurrency enthusiasts, yay Bitcoin, have

23:11.920 --> 23:16.680
been just kind of waiting. Who's going to figure this out? I thought it would be Microsoft,

23:16.680 --> 23:17.680
but apparently it's Facebook.

23:17.680 --> 23:22.560
Yeah, so it would seem. And our speculation last week about the price of Bitcoin going

23:22.560 --> 23:29.200
up seems to have been correct because it has. It's been somewhat volatile, shall we say,

23:29.200 --> 23:32.280
but it has gone up. Good news.

23:32.280 --> 23:36.800
It wouldn't be a Bitcoin story without a little bit of volatility in there, would it?

23:36.800 --> 23:41.600
Even though this Libra is, people are saying, it's not even a proper cryptocurrency. It's

23:41.600 --> 23:47.800
basically just a fiat currency. And there's been a lot of naysayers, but I think that

23:47.800 --> 23:51.480
it potentially has some legs. I don't know. I still don't know where I stand, whether

23:51.480 --> 23:56.960
it's the death battle of a dying company, very slowly dying company, or whether it's

23:56.960 --> 24:02.360
going to really take off and make them a bunch of money in developing nations. I think really

24:02.360 --> 24:05.240
we have to wait until it's launched next year.

24:05.240 --> 24:11.580
Absolutely. I'm sitting here with a huge smile on my face right now because I love all of

24:11.580 --> 24:17.720
the parallels to free software and open source that are happening in the financial sector.

24:17.720 --> 24:25.320
It's amazing. It feels like it's 1979 for the financial institutions right now. And

24:25.320 --> 24:31.760
they are about to witness a reckoning when an open source way of doing currency comes.

24:31.760 --> 24:38.220
And it's math backed at that. I really enjoy this. And there's so many parallels for somebody

24:38.220 --> 24:42.080
who has been watching the free software and open source communities for years when it

24:42.080 --> 24:48.280
comes to cryptocurrency. And it is one of the grandest experiments that's going to happen

24:48.280 --> 24:54.360
on the human stage when it comes to software and everyday life. I can't wait to see where

24:54.360 --> 25:00.280
this goes because we have a very special position in history to watch this thing unfold.

25:00.280 --> 25:03.040
Who's going to be the richest storm in a bit though? That's the big question.

25:03.040 --> 25:10.560
Hey, at the end of the day, Joe, we're all Satoshi Nokamoto. Well, wherever it goes,
