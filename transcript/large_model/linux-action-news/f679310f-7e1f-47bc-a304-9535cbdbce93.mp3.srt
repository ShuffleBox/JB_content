00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,560
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,940
This is episode 73, recorded on September 30th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,940
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,940
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,940
And welcome back, Chris.

6
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,940
Hello, Joe.

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,160
It's good to be connected with you.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,280
It's great to be co-hosting with you again.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,560
And I'm not the only one celebrating this week.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,720
Google turns 20, and Android turns 10 years old.

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,280
Yeah, and there's an article on TechCrunch that brought this to my attention that's got

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,900
a kind of rundown of the history of Android phones.

13
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:44,300
It's not complete history, but it shows some significant milestones.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,520
And we really have come a long way, haven't we, since the beginning.

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,840
I was going over a couple of the major ones that I remember, and I realized I was really

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,800
into Android in the early days.

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,840
I pretty much went through all of this.

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,600
I remember when the Nexus One came out with its cool new OLED screen and nice design.

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,640
And then when I got the Evo 4G with WiMAX, that really took things to the next level.

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,680
I started really playing with ROMs, swapping out SIM cards, going with extended, crazy

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,880
super batteries.

22
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,600
And then I started to remember things transitioning into a competitive era with Apple, where they

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,920
were really trying to match feature for feature.

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,000
There was that weird release of Android that was really only meant for tablets.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,160
Do you remember all this stuff?

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,540
Yeah, well, that was on the Motorola Zoom, Honeycomb, the version was.

27
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:36,440
And I actually had a Motorola Zoom, and it was pretty cool to be on the bleeding edge

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,780
for once.

29
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,360
And it wasn't actually too bad.

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,700
It was properly designed for a tablet, but it just seems that it never quite competed

31
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,700
with the iPad, did it?

32
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,500
Yeah, tablets never really took off the way everyone thought they were going to in general

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
back then.

34
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:54,840
They were out there, but they didn't replace the PC like everyone was claiming was going

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,840
to happen, which I never really bought into.

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,520
I do remember those sort of peak hardware Android release for me.

37
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,880
And that was right around the time the Nexus 5X came out.

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,860
I bought other phones after that, but the 5X was sort of my favorite Android phone.

39
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,180
And it became really easy later on to swap in different ROMs and pretty well supported

40
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,760
in the community in general out there.

41
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,680
Well, for me, the Nexus 4 was that moment, really, because the price was so low compared

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,320
to the competition for the specs that you got.

43
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,880
And although they cut a few corners with the camera and stuff like that, it was still an

44
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,400
amazing phone for the price.

45
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,960
And that's why it ended up being the basis for so many projects like Ubuntu Touch and

46
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
Sailfish.

47
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,720
And there's so many ROMs still available for that phone.

48
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,320
That was just one of the great things about the Nexus line in general is that it was a

49
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,360
pretty good phone, well supported by Google, and then eventually the community for a price

50
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,360
that was really competitive, cheaper than, say, a Pixel or a high-end Samsung or iPhone

51
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
is today.

52
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,260
Yeah, but then the 5X was where the price started to creep up.

53
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,360
And then the 6 was ridiculously expensive.

54
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,340
And then the 6P, again, was just stupidly expensive.

55
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:09,140
And that's probably what led to the decline in popularity and ultimately them just getting

56
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,740
rid of the Nexus line and replacing it with Pixel, which are premium, high-end phones

57
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,720
for a high-end price.

58
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,520
And here we are 10 years on, and the Pixel 3 is about to come out, and it's their 10-year

59
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
flagship.

60
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,420
So it's kind of crunch time for them, really.

61
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,360
They have to deliver a good phone with this.

62
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
Right.

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,280
That is an interesting context in which we're going to see the Pixel 3 announced is 10 years

64
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,700
of learning how to do Android and learning what phone hardware works and doesn't work.

65
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,980
If it's not a great phone after 10 years, you do kind of have to wonder what's going

66
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,980
on.

67
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,980
I'm curious.

68
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,760
I haven't made the jump since the 6P.

69
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,520
The Pixel 3 was always the one I said since the day they launched the Pixel program.

70
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,920
I'll wait for the third release because that's when they should have it nice and refined.

71
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,900
So I'm particularly interested.

72
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,080
But it's not all about Google's Android division.

73
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,620
No, the 20-year-old company also has deep down in its bowels a strike team, if you will.

74
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,160
It's called Project Zero.

75
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,840
We've covered them a ton on the TechSnap program because they're super active in the security

76
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,780
research area.

77
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,060
And this week, they're accusing some Linux distributions you may have heard of, of leaving

78
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,920
their users exposed to known kernel vulnerabilities for weeks.

79
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,160
Which is funny that we've just talked about Android and then another division of Google

80
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,960
criticizing distros for being tardy with patches.

81
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,400
I mean, come on.

82
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,440
Android is the worst example of that.

83
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
Hey now, Joe.

84
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,440
It's fair.

85
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,840
If you have a Pixel phone, you get monthly security updates, which he actually criticizes

86
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,480
in his blog post as well.

87
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,020
He is Jan Horn, I believe is how you say his name.

88
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,160
And he's a member of Google's Project Zero team.

89
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,840
He's a researcher who discovered the meltdown and Spectre CPU flaws.

90
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,080
And he's had a few harsh words for the maintainers of Ubuntu and Debian specifically.

91
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,620
He says they need to raise their game on merging upstream kernel security fixes faster and

92
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,680
shipping it to users faster.

93
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,240
So do you think this is fair criticism?

94
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,300
No, I think this is not fair criticism.

95
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,520
So here's the timeline, essentially.

96
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,620
It's a matter of weeks.

97
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,400
This was discovered at CVE 2018-17-182.

98
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,220
It was reported to the Linux kernel maintainers on September 12.

99
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,480
And Linus, who was very productive back then, got it merged impressively fast in a single

100
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,000
day after Horn reported the issue.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,480
And within days, it was also fixed in the upstream stable kernel releases 4.18, 9, and

102
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,440
the other stables that came out that day.

103
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,740
But Horn points out that some distributions, even though the upstream patch was available

104
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,040
in a matter of days, have taken weeks to get them in their kernel.

105
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:49,960
In fact, Debian even, he says, shipped a kernel based on 4.9, but didn't include the security

106
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
fix.

107
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,280
And Ubuntu shipped a kernel on August 27 without the fix.

108
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,000
And he makes the point that when we have a security critical fix that's available in

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,960
an upstream stable kernel, it can take weeks before the fix is actually available to end

110
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,920
users, especially if the security impact is not announced publicly.

111
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,040
But he says it's worse when it is announced publicly, because then people start working

112
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,040
on exploits immediately.

113
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,320
So that's why users are extra vulnerable, he makes the case.

114
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,560
But he doesn't seem to understand about the QA process then, and the fact that you can't

115
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,620
just push this stuff out and hope for the best.

116
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,600
To that point, there's testing, but on top of that, there's a process here.

117
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,440
And Canonical, for example, did respond to his blog post and said the fixes are scheduled

118
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,200
to be released around Monday, October 1st.

119
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,840
I have a link in the show notes, but they just had to go through a process, like you

120
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,840
point out.

121
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,560
And now it's tagged for release in the next batch of updates that go out.

122
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,840
So it's really a matter of perspective.

123
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,440
If you're the CTO at a company that has systems that are several years out of date, then weeks

124
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,620
to get a fix out to end users is more than enough.

125
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,000
But from Horn's perspective, down in the bowels of the Googleplex and Project Zero, where

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,640
they're sitting on the strike team taking care of security issues like maniacs, hours

127
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,640
are days.

128
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,080
He's living an internet time.

129
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,760
He wants it to go, go, go.

130
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,260
We got the fix in, Linus got it merged, it's in the stable branch, everybody go.

131
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:14,760
And I think some of his experience with Meltdown and Spectre is also coloring his view here.

132
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,680
You have to take that into context as well.

133
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,920
Red Hat was a distribution that was able to respond extremely quickly to the Meltdown

134
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,640
vulnerability because they got a heads up directly from Intel.

135
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:30,440
Other distributions, famously, some large distributions, did not get that direct heads

136
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,880
up and had to hustle through the holidays in the middle of other things to get patches

137
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,240
out to end users.

138
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,120
And now they're being criticized by some of the same people involved for not responding

139
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,320
fast enough.

140
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,480
So in my opinion, I think Horn comes across a little skewed here.

141
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,600
He's working on internet time.

142
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,160
But I think his past experience with getting the Meltdown and Spectre fixes out have colored

143
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,920
his perspective on this issue here.

144
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Well, exactly.

145
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:01,600
And I would rather wait two or three weeks and have my server still work than have the

146
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,440
fix straight away and have it potentially not.

147
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Yeah.

148
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,840
And in the case of Debian, I think there's sort of an unspoken social contract there

149
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,200
between the distro and the end user.

150
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,160
And that is that Debian is going to take an even steady hand with this stuff.

151
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,640
They'll get the software out in due time, but Debian's not rushing anything to end users.

152
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,780
They try to make an exception for security, but that's your expectation as an end user.

153
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,680
And in Ubuntu's case, they're going to have that thing shipped on October 1st or around

154
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
there.

155
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,040
But I think Horn should give them a little credit for having a live patch service that

156
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:39,040
is available, I believe, up to three systems for free where you can just have immediate

157
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,000
software updates that are a critical nature to the kernel delivered and live patch into

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,360
your system without having to reboot.

159
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,440
That kind of feature helps close that gaps I was talking about with enterprises where

160
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,480
they go years without patching because they don't want to take down production.

161
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,680
And making that system easily available, Red Hat has something similar, so does SUSE, they

162
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,520
should get credit for that because that really makes a difference in the actual real world.

163
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
Whereas I don't use that.

164
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,080
I just reboot and cross my fingers.

165
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,640
You know, I've been trying it out on a couple of systems this year since I set up the Ubuntu

166
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,600
1804 workstations in the studio, and I completely forget about it until I realize I have it

167
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
on.

168
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
So, so far, it seems to be fine.

169
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
There's my in-depth review.

170
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
Nice.

171
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,320
Yeah, I'll try it one of these days, but in the meantime, yeah, just cross my fingers.

172
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
All right.

173
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,000
Well, speaking of the kernel, last episode, Wes and I talked about Linus taking a break

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
in the new code of conduct.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,520
And there's no doubt that that code of conduct has been a little bit divisive, shall we say.

176
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,320
And there are those people who are very much against the adoption of it.

177
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,800
And one of those people sent an email to the kernel mailing list about a week and a half

178
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,360
ago that was, quite frankly, full of nonsense.

179
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,260
But it seems to have been picked up on by quite a few people and for some reason has

180
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,800
caused a bit of controversy.

181
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,460
I think that's just because of how that email was written.

182
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,120
It was strongly worded.

183
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,440
It suggested that, quote, contract that had been established between the contributor and

184
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,320
the kernel team had changed, that their original contributions took place during a meritocracy.

185
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,920
And that has now changed.

186
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,540
And therefore, they have the right to revoke their work based on copyright ownership.

187
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:21,300
And it was all described in a very thick legalese that made it sound possible because it's perhaps

188
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,360
even written by a lawyer.

189
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,220
And I think that almost gave it some legitimacy in its own, even though the idea was bonkers.

190
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:35,160
It took off like wildfire to a degree simply because of how it was written and the argument

191
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
that was being made.

192
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,260
But it is bonkers and nonsense.

193
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,440
That's not how the GPL works, is it?

194
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:47,620
If you release code under the GPL, then that is GPL code and people can do what they want

195
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,480
with it as long as they obey the terms of the license, as long as, well, you know, they

196
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,920
obey the GPL v2.

197
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,400
So you can stop contributing and you can make further code that you write licensed however

198
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
you want.

199
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,500
And you can even take code that you have submitted to the kernel and is being approved and license

200
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,840
it in a separate project because you're the copyright holder.

201
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,280
But once you have made it GPLed, then that's it.

202
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,280
There's no going back.

203
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,360
You can't just pull it out of the kernel.

204
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,560
You know, I'm not a lawyer and all of that, but I've read enough about this to know.

205
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,360
I mean, my instincts told me that this was nonsense.

206
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,840
And then having read about it, we shouldn't even really be talking about it, but it has

207
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,000
spread and I felt that we should kind of try and stamp this out.

208
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yeah.

209
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,040
It has spread all the way to the Software Freedom Conservancy who thought it was necessary

210
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,180
to reach out to their outside counsel.

211
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:46,720
And then together they updated the copy left and GNU public license, a comprehensive tutorial

212
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
and guide.

213
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,360
And you could think of this guide as setting up a structure of expectations around what

214
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,920
contributors and users can expect when using GPL software.

215
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,240
And if you ever to take something to court, the court would likely operate, again, I'm

216
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,120
not a lawyer, but would likely operate under the assumption that you agreed to that guideline

217
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,200
as well as the actual terms of the GPL version two.

218
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
So they updated their guideline in particular.

219
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,520
They say a contributor may only modify the software and distribute that contribution

220
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,920
if they have agreed to the full text of the GPL two and the contributor is of course free

221
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,440
to make no future grants, but they cannot withdraw past grants.

222
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Yeah.

223
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,180
The whole point of the GPL essentially, or one of the main points of it.

224
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:40,080
So strange that this became such a story because it just is a non-story really.

225
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,520
Well, that's perfect because there's a non-distribution with some news this week.

226
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:50,800
KDE Neon has been re-based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, bionic beaver, and I'm elated.

227
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,280
I've updated all of my Neon systems.

228
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,920
Don't call it a distribution, but do upgrade if you're a Neon user because it's gone great

229
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920
so far for me.

230
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,760
A few reports here and there, but the team really seems to have worked hard to make this

231
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,640
as smooth as possible for end users.

232
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,080
Yeah, and I tried it out on hardware today, installed absolutely fine, had a little play

233
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
with it.

234
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,880
Everything seemed to work perfectly.

235
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,040
It's not very different in the experience that you had on 16.04 because obviously you

236
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,200
got the latest KDE and you had that before, and so now it's just all of the innards have

237
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,500
been updated to Ubuntu 18.04, so you've got the newer kernel and newer packages.

238
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,000
So really, I suppose the highest praise that you can give it is that I don't notice any

239
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,960
difference and presumably you haven't noticed much difference.

240
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:37,560
I noticed a couple of small things because I've been following Nate Graham's weekly usability

241
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,960
updates about Plasma, which cover all the small things that they've been working on.

242
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:48,120
In fact, we had Nate Graham on Linux Unplugged last week, linuxunplugged.com.268.

243
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,800
He comes on and talks about some of the efforts he's been focused on to improve usability

244
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,160
for the Plasma desktop and make it more approachable.

245
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,280
He's a former Apple engineer and he's been bringing some of that experience to the Plasma

246
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,300
desktop, but he also gets into one of the number one questions I get whenever we talk

247
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:08,040
about Neon, and that is, what's the difference between Kubuntu and Neon?

248
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,200
And I'm just going to quickly go into this because at the core of it, I'm an advocate

249
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,520
for Linux, and I think one of the best ways to get Linux out there on more desktops, especially

250
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,760
workstation desktops, is a really great desktop experience.

251
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,560
And I think Plasma right now is delivering that, and so I'm really just super enthusiastic

252
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,260
about getting people to try it.

253
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,800
And so if you want a workstation grade operating system, something that'd be great for development

254
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,640
or in IT, or like I'm using Kubuntu here in production, you go with Kubuntu 18.04.

255
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,800
It's long-term support from the bottom all the way up.

256
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,960
The Ubuntu base, the Qt libraries that the Plasma desktop is based on, and then Plasma

257
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,200
itself is an LTS release of the Plasma desktop.

258
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,840
Kubuntu 18.04 is really rock solid.

259
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:00,760
Neon is a bit more focused at developers who are working with Qt, or perhaps enthusiasts,

260
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:07,000
or those that want the freshest desktop experience with a rock-solid reliable base.

261
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:15,560
So KDE Neon is now based on Ubuntu 18.04 long-term support base OS, but the Plasma desktop is

262
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,360
really fresh.

263
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,280
Essentially as soon as the developers stamp it as stable and ready to go, you get the

264
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,940
updates to your desktop.

265
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,820
They have three editions for different use cases.

266
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,520
The user edition is for those that want the latest released KDE software updated daily,

267
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,720
but only released when it passes a QA test.

268
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,520
So that's the version I have.

269
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:40,040
And then they have two developer editions built from unstable and even Git branches.

270
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,560
No QA checks, but it's for those that want to test or develop maybe a forthcoming software

271
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,360
that you're going to release in a few months or a year on the Linux desktop, and so you

272
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,720
want to be working with the latest stuff.

273
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,200
And the other thing that's really cool about Neon is not only do they have a whole deb

274
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:59,840
package archive that you could just work with, but they have ISOs and Docker images.

275
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,600
And you can just play around with this stuff in a Docker image on your existing system.

276
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,640
They also have snap packages they're working on where you're going to be able to snap install

277
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,080
some of this stuff.

278
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,120
They're going to be focusing more on that now that they're finished with the 18.04 rebase.

279
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,320
So it's really fascinating.

280
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,580
They don't like to call it a distro.

281
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:21,720
It's more like a meta environment on top of Ubuntu 18.04 is how they like you to think

282
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
about it.

283
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:29,200
But for me, it makes for a killer desktop because I get fresh Plasma, stable Ubuntu,

284
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,680
and recent user land applications.

285
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:34,800
All right, I'm off my soapbox, but I just encourage everybody to go check one of these

286
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
out.

287
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,560
Well, if I was going to move to Plasma, I think Neon is what I would use because of

288
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,520
that solid base, but the fresh desktop on top of it.

289
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:48,400
And I know people who use KDE Neon for their work and rely on it, and maybe it's not quite

290
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,040
as rock solid as Ubuntu, but it is pretty close.

291
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,840
Yeah, you know, my closing thoughts on this is it's really the realization that Plasma

292
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:02,160
now for many, many, many releases in a row has been getting better and better.

293
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,660
And if there are regressions, they very quickly fix them.

294
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:11,460
And so what we've got now is a desktop environment that's been in a refinement phase for maybe

295
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,840
two years now.

296
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,720
And that's why you're hearing more about it.

297
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,160
That's why people are talking more about Neon and Kubuntu and other Plasma desktop-based

298
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,280
distros, because the desktop environment itself is really matured.

299
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,360
It's multi-threaded.

300
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,120
It works well with your GPU.

301
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,200
They're really far on their Wayland support.

302
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,860
It's clean, and it's lower resources than you expect.

303
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,720
So it's getting just a bit more attention these days.

304
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,560
You really are in love with Plasma, aren't you?

305
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,680
You know, it's made me really excited about the desktop again.

306
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,480
I kind of just started back on, backing off, that's a tool.

307
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
It's fine.

308
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,480
It's okay.

309
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,180
You know, it's a compromise is what I was starting to think from time to time.

310
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,520
And now I'm just loving it.

311
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,920
I just love setting up Plasma.

312
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,660
I love getting it all tweaked the way I want.

313
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,660
Just great.

314
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,920
It's quite clear that you're in love with Plasma and Linux generally.

315
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:04,680
And it seems that SAR Microsoft, and for good reason, it seems that at least half of Azure

316
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
is running Linux.

317
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
Yeah.

318
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:12,080
They say it varies on the day because a lot of these workloads are, as they put it, elastic,

319
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,440
but sometimes slightly over a half of Azure.

320
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:24,400
So maybe like 60%, and usually about half in general of Azure VMs are running Linux.

321
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,620
It suddenly all makes sense, doesn't it?

322
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:33,360
Why Microsoft are so all in on Linux, trying to get Linux integrated into the Windows 10

323
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,920
desktop as much as possible because they want people to use Azure.

324
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,720
And if they're going to be running Linux on there, why not give them the tools to run

325
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,700
Linux on the Windows 10 desktop?

326
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,680
They say it's been a 10 year journey when they open sourced ASP.net and then just started

327
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,520
seeing some of the benefits.

328
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:57,000
And now they claim to have 20,000 Microsoft employees on GitHub and 200 open source projects

329
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,320
that are out there.

330
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,480
And all of this makes sense when you consider my saying that I have for Microsoft, all roads

331
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,260
lead to Azure.

332
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,080
That's the context in which you think of Microsoft.

333
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,120
If you're trying to figure out what they're doing, all roads lead to Azure.

334
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:18,900
And the embracing of Linux and open source that we've seen recently leads back to Azure.

335
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:24,480
To that end, our friends here at Linux Academy have several Azure positions open, I am told,

336
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,120
and they're full-time and remote.

337
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,080
So I'll put a link in the show notes, linuxactionnews.com slash...

338
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
73.

339
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,080
Yeah.

340
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,160
So we'll have a link in the show notes there if you are an Azure expert and are looking

341
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
for some work because it seems to be growing quite a bit.

342
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,600
I've seen some of the feedback that rolls in and people want to know more about it and

343
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,220
it's hard to really wrap your head around how fast these services like AWS and Azure

344
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,220
can grow.

345
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,920
Well, that's the enterprise side of things, but end users will appreciate what Mozilla's

346
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,200
been up to again this week with adding yet more features to Firefox.

347
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
This one's pretty great.

348
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,960
It's called Firefox Monitor.

349
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,740
And I knew this was coming down the pipe because we've been covering the Have I Been Pwned

350
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,920
service on TechSnap since it launched years ago.

351
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:10,080
And they have been growing and becoming more of like a database API interface that some

352
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,480
password managers like 1Password will interface with to see if you've been compromised.

353
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,840
I don't know if you recall this service, Joe, but one of the many ways that they work is

354
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,720
they collect leaked databases of usernames and passwords and they follow reports from

355
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,320
companies of what user accounts have been breached.

356
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,880
They mix it all together in their database.

357
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,200
They track all of that amongst many other ways they collect information, all pretty

358
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,840
sophisticated and interesting.

359
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,360
And then they let you query it by like plugging in your email address on their website.

360
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,840
And now they've been working on a way to let services like Firefox Monitor to check in

361
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,960
for you.

362
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,000
And they do it in a really clever way that doesn't reveal your credentials, doesn't leak

363
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,300
the information.

364
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,300
It's pretty sophisticated.

365
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,320
We covered it in depth on TechSnap.

366
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,320
And all you have to do is give your email address and it will check the Have I Been

367
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,800
Pwned database to show if you need to worry about some of your data being compromised

368
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,600
and where you might need to change your passwords.

369
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,320
And now you can give it those credentials and it'll tell you in the future if they've

370
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,240
been leaked somewhere.

371
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,600
Mozilla asked people a couple of years ago about some of the new features that they could

372
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,560
bring to Firefox and notifications about breaches in general was one of the most highly requested

373
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,560
item on people's lists.

374
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,960
And it's a nice system.

375
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,320
I know it seems a little odd giving your credentials to a service and all of that, but it's a really

376
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,360
well-built system that is very focused on your privacy.

377
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,060
Check out the backlog of TechSnap if you're curious.

378
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:39,640
But I find it kind of funny because in a way, this feels like Mozilla giving Chrome a bit

379
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,120
of a kick in because this last week or two, there's been a lot of hubbub about Chrome

380
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,000
auto logging you in and keeping Google cookies when you remove cookies.

381
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,240
And in that same news cycle, Mozilla comes out with this Firefox monitor announcement

382
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,080
where now they're going to proactively alert you about breaches and they do it in a really

383
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
clever way.

384
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,600
I got to tip my hat to Mozilla on this one.

385
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,600
Well done.

386
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,600
I got to tip my hat to them for telling me about something that I cannot believe this

387
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
right.

388
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:16,280
Did you know that on July 1st, 2008, MySpace leaked 360 million credentials, emails, passwords,

389
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,120
and usernames?

390
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,680
I'd forgotten about that one, but that's how popular MySpace was once upon a time.

391
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,280
Yeah, that reminds us that MySpace was in fact a thing for a while.

392
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,280
Not really relevant today because now those numbers just get thrown around like crazy,

393
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,080
but that does show you that they had a heyday and I bet my credentials were in there at

394
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,080
some point.

395
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,240
I know I had a MySpace account, but never with autoplaying music.

396
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm afraid I was an offender there.

397
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,280
Oh, I'm not surprised by that at all.

398
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,880
All right, well, let's end with a quick community shout out.

399
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,880
Mintcast, which is the podcast by the Linux Mint community for all users of Linux, which

400
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,000
has been going for almost 10 years, needs new hosts.

401
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,040
Rob and Isaac have had enough and they don't want to do it anymore, but they don't want

402
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,000
to just stop because they were not the original hosts.

403
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,800
It's had many, many hosts, including me, funnily enough.

404
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,880
That was the first Linux podcast I ever appeared on.

405
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,240
So I kind of owe them a bit of a debt, really.

406
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,960
That's where I cut my teeth.

407
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:28,000
So if you're interested in getting into Linux podcasting, if you like Linux Mint and know

408
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,280
a little bit about it, they are going to help you take over, essentially.

409
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,080
They're not just going to abandon it.

410
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,760
On the latest episode, which we'll link to, they talk about how they want to kind of pass

411
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,520
the torch on to new hosts and show them how they've been doing it.

412
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,280
And I'm available to help a little bit if necessary as well with how to do the audio

413
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,840
and everything.

414
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,680
So if you've been thinking about starting a Linux podcast, contribute to an existing

415
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,000
project rather than starting a new one is my advice.

416
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,840
Get in touch with them.

417
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,840
Everything's over at mintcast.org.

418
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,080
That could be a great opportunity.

419
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,080
And I agree.

420
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,080
Let's keep the community strong.

421
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,920
Now, this show is strong and will be out every single week.

422
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,240

We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

426
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,560
I'm at Chris LAS.

427
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,040
I'm at Joe Roisington.

428
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,800
Thank you for joining us and we'll see you next week.

429
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:52,000
Take care.
