Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 153, recorded on September 6th, 2020.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.240
I'm Chris.

00:10.240 --> 00:11.240
And I'm Joe.

00:11.240 --> 00:12.240
Hello, Joe.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.240
Welcome back.

00:13.240 --> 00:14.840
We start with some great news this week.

00:14.840 --> 00:19.240
Lenovo has begun rolling out Fedora Linux on their laptops, with Ubuntu not too far

00:19.240 --> 00:20.240
behind.

00:20.240 --> 00:24.640
Yeah, we've known this was coming since April, but now it's finally rolling out.

00:24.640 --> 00:28.320
And it's right there front and center on the Lenovo website.

00:28.320 --> 00:33.220
You can buy an X1 Carbon Generation 8, and it's even slightly cheaper if you get it with

00:33.220 --> 00:34.220
Fedora.

00:34.220 --> 00:38.800
Yeah, not only front and center, like you mentioned, but it's just straight Fedora.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.200
It's not necessarily a modified install, which is really nice to see.

00:42.200 --> 00:46.240
It's currently only rolled out to the US, but it seems like other markets are going

00:46.240 --> 00:51.960
to follow, as well as potentially the ThinkPad P1 Gen 2 and the ThinkPad P53.

00:51.960 --> 00:55.880
And we'll also be seeing Ubuntu pre-installed on some of these Lenovo machines soon.

00:55.880 --> 01:03.480
Yeah, it's not quite clear, but a Lenovo employee on August 29, 2020, said that the Ubuntu X1

01:03.480 --> 01:08.800
Carbon, along, quote, with a number of other Ubuntu systems, will be coming very soon.

01:08.800 --> 01:13.000
But we hit an internal snag with getting the platform up that needed fixing.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.940
And that meant laying the Ubuntu system just a little bit.

01:15.940 --> 01:17.640
So it seems like it's pretty close.

01:17.640 --> 01:18.640
You'll have your choice.

01:18.640 --> 01:23.300
And we also got an announcement this week from Canonical about the HP Z series laptops

01:23.300 --> 01:25.800
or Z series, as you would say.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.960
They are going to come preloaded with Ubuntu.

01:28.960 --> 01:32.280
So that's HP reaffirming their commitment to selling laptops with Linux.

01:32.280 --> 01:36.320
And so now, obviously, we've got Dell as well, and Lenovo.

01:36.320 --> 01:41.280
That's three of the biggest players in the laptop market selling pre-installed Linux

01:41.280 --> 01:46.280
machines, as well as, obviously, Entryware and System76 and all of the smaller independent

01:46.280 --> 01:47.280
players.

01:47.280 --> 01:49.360
It feels like we're really there.

01:49.360 --> 01:54.840
What I think is interesting about each one of these OEMs is the machines they're choosing

01:54.840 --> 01:57.640
to release that support Linux.

01:57.640 --> 02:03.760
Like in the case of the HP Z series, those are high-end machines, right, with Quadro

02:03.760 --> 02:08.480
RTX GPUs in them and the latest Intel CPUs.

02:08.480 --> 02:13.680
And they have a high-end HP Studio Create type machine, too, that has high-end components.

02:13.680 --> 02:19.000
Again, they talk a lot about machine learning in the announcement and GPU accelerated tasks,

02:19.000 --> 02:21.580
lots of focus on that in HP.

02:21.580 --> 02:27.660
In the Lenovo Carbon line, you see a developer workstation, a similar approach that Dell

02:27.660 --> 02:28.760
is taking.

02:28.760 --> 02:33.520
I think it's kind of this story of we think we have identified the user for these and

02:33.520 --> 02:35.860
have now begun to build a product for them.

02:35.860 --> 02:37.240
And they're all kind of syncing up.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.280
And in a way, it's kind of like what took them so long.

02:40.280 --> 02:46.000
Because it seems like System76 and Dell with the Sputnik project kind of proved this model

02:46.000 --> 02:50.320
out, I don't know, five, six, seven years ago at least.

02:50.320 --> 02:54.600
So I don't know what took them so long, but it's actually nice to see it.

02:54.600 --> 02:59.840
And I think you have to appreciate the impact that upstream projects like the Linux vendor

02:59.840 --> 03:05.100
firmware service and upstream working with the kernel and driver development have impacted

03:05.100 --> 03:07.320
and made this possible.

03:07.320 --> 03:14.000
It's pretty great because chances are if these things are running stock 2004 or stock Fedora

03:14.000 --> 03:18.280
or even close to it, you're going to have a pretty easy time getting whatever distribution

03:18.280 --> 03:19.520
you want on there.

03:19.520 --> 03:23.160
Now that to me is truly like that's the moment there.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.160
That's what I always wanted.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.320
It's great to come loaded with something.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.320
Good.

03:27.320 --> 03:30.840
But I always wanted the ability to put whatever I want on that machine.

03:30.840 --> 03:31.840
Oh, yeah.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.000
And that's the good thing about the ThinkPads at least.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.460
We've got that promise that it is just going to be vanilla upstream Fedora with no patches

03:38.460 --> 03:39.680
or anything.

03:39.680 --> 03:43.720
And so yeah, if it's going to work with Fedora, put Arch on there, Suza, whatever.

03:43.720 --> 03:45.520
It's going to work pretty much guaranteed.

03:45.520 --> 03:51.960
The other thing is I hope there's a revenue story at least in some capacity for the distributions

03:51.960 --> 03:52.960
involved here.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.320
I'm not quite clear on what it might be.

03:55.320 --> 03:59.040
It seems like there's ancillary benefits besides just direct revenue, but it would be fantastic

03:59.040 --> 04:03.360
if there is some revenue for those projects as well to help with development.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.320
But they're nice looking machines.

04:05.320 --> 04:08.520
It's interesting that none of them quite appeal to me.

04:08.520 --> 04:12.600
I gave a real look at the ThinkPads and I'm not really in a position to buy one right

04:12.600 --> 04:19.680
now, but just like going with my shopping eyes, would any of these appeal to me?

04:19.680 --> 04:21.480
Not quite.

04:21.480 --> 04:24.880
Maybe the HPs, but I don't really want to pay the premium for a Quadro either.

04:24.880 --> 04:29.560
I want a GPU, but I don't want something that expensive.

04:29.560 --> 04:34.640
So that's where things like the System76 lineup or the Entryware lineup almost kind of appeals

04:34.640 --> 04:40.960
to my kind of Linux use a little bit more, but not trying to downplay the Lenovo stuff

04:40.960 --> 04:44.440
and the HP stuff, because I think it means that you're going to appeal to businesses

04:44.440 --> 04:46.640
a lot more and developers a lot more.

04:46.640 --> 04:47.640
And that's great.

04:47.640 --> 04:52.520
Well, as for the revenue for the various projects, well, for Canonical to certify a device to

04:52.520 --> 04:56.960
work with Ubuntu, there's a lot of work goes into that and you have to pay them quite a

04:56.960 --> 04:59.080
bit for the privilege of that.

04:59.080 --> 05:04.600
So I would be very surprised if HP haven't paid Canonical a decent chunk of money for

05:04.600 --> 05:05.600
this Z series.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.600
Yeah, very likely.

05:06.600 --> 05:11.080
I mean, even if it's not a lot, even if it's only a few dollars per machine, depending

05:11.080 --> 05:15.600
on what the negotiation rate is, that means at least HP and Dell are doing that, which

05:15.600 --> 05:20.080
means that the Ubuntu desktop is making money for Canonical.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.840
That's also a big deal for Ubuntu users.

05:21.840 --> 05:26.320
That means the Ubuntu desktop is a revenue source for Canonical and it's going to be

05:26.320 --> 05:28.160
treated as such.

05:28.160 --> 05:32.960
And I think that is, even if you don't buy an HP laptop or a Lenovo laptop, I think

05:32.960 --> 05:34.520
that's good for Ubuntu desktop users.

05:34.520 --> 05:38.640
Yeah, I think it's been the case for a while that it's been somewhat profitable, but obviously

05:38.640 --> 05:44.420
the more profitable the desktop is for Canonical, the more likely it is to hang around.

05:44.420 --> 05:47.560
As well as obviously the political reasons, it wouldn't be a good look for them to get

05:47.560 --> 05:50.920
rid of the desktop and just abandon it to the community.

05:50.920 --> 05:56.700
But when this IPO comes around or whether they sell or whatever, if you've got a nice

05:56.700 --> 06:02.160
healthy profit margin coming from your desktop, then it's almost certainly going to survive.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.600
Yeah, it's about time we cook up some new crazy prediction.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.440
You know how the prediction's always been Microsoft is going to buy Canonical or something

06:09.440 --> 06:10.440
like that.

06:10.440 --> 06:17.320
I feel like the new one needs to be the Canonical change to become revenue, whatever, is they

06:17.320 --> 06:23.080
become like a WSL first desktop where you use the Windows desktop, but it's all Canonical's

06:23.080 --> 06:26.540
tools underneath and they just abandoned the desktop project.

06:26.540 --> 06:27.680
It's totally never going to happen, right?

06:27.680 --> 06:30.760
But it just seems like a great conspiracy like, oh, WSL is going to be the end of the

06:30.760 --> 06:32.320
Ubuntu desktop or something.

06:32.320 --> 06:33.320
Yeah.

06:33.320 --> 06:36.000
Why not start our return episode with Wild Conspiracy Theory?

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Great idea.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
I thought so.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.240
You know, for a news show, it seems pretty solid.

06:39.240 --> 06:44.120
Actually, why don't we go back to the news and talk about the PinePhone shipping, Manjaro,

06:44.120 --> 06:45.520
for the next community edition?

06:45.520 --> 06:46.520
Yeah.

06:46.520 --> 06:51.440
So this is relatively hot on the heels of the post-market OS edition.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.280
And this time it's going to have two different variants as well.

06:54.280 --> 06:59.000
One for $149 that is just the basic two gigabytes of RAM model.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.840
And then the $199 one, which is three gigabytes of RAM and double the storage.

07:03.840 --> 07:10.260
And also includes the USB-C dock, which allows you to have potentially at least convergence.

07:10.260 --> 07:14.820
So this is very similar hardware to the last community edition, but this is going to come

07:14.820 --> 07:15.820
with Manjaro.

07:15.820 --> 07:23.400
Now, I have a PinePhone and I checked out Manjaro on it and it's actually very promising.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.120
It's early, but it's promising.

07:25.120 --> 07:26.120
Yeah.

07:26.120 --> 07:29.960
And I think they have sharp people in the Manjaro project that are working on those

07:29.960 --> 07:35.120
ports because I've experimented on the PineBook Pro and at the end of the day, I stuck with

07:35.120 --> 07:36.120
Manjaro on it.

07:36.120 --> 07:40.600
And I think it's in part because these are so early in the development process that getting

07:40.600 --> 07:45.360
access to that super fresh software and kernel and driver stack makes a difference on a device

07:45.360 --> 07:46.360
like this.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.960
I mean, it can make a huge difference in performance and battery life.

07:48.960 --> 07:54.600
And like we just saw from the UberPorts project, camera frame rate even can be impacted significantly

07:54.600 --> 07:56.200
by software updates.

07:56.200 --> 08:01.760
I think going back to this though, what's interesting about the $199 variant is that

08:01.760 --> 08:05.960
bundled USB-C dock, they're calling that the convergence package.

08:05.960 --> 08:12.320
And that dock has a 10100 Ethernet and two USB-A ports on it and an HDMI out.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.480
So the idea is you...

08:13.480 --> 08:17.720
And you power over USB-C. So the idea is you power with a USB-C cord, you hook up your

08:17.720 --> 08:23.040
mouse and keyboard, you hook up an HDMI display, and now you're using that classic idea of

08:23.040 --> 08:25.040
a converged device.

08:25.040 --> 08:29.240
So then I imagine you'd have a somewhat usable desktop, but I can't picture the performance

08:29.240 --> 08:30.240
is going to be great.

08:30.240 --> 08:33.180
No, I think it's more proof of concept really.

08:33.180 --> 08:38.240
But the thing is that if you can prove your concept on a low-end device like this, then

08:38.240 --> 08:44.860
you suddenly apply that concept and code to a higher performance device, then it's presumably

08:44.860 --> 08:46.360
going to fly on it.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.120
So that's the hope at least.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.920
We might get a PinePhone Pro at some point.

08:50.920 --> 08:51.920
Who knows?

08:51.920 --> 08:55.420
I mean, it's pure speculation at this point, but you have to figure that's where it's going.

08:55.420 --> 08:59.720
It might be another couple of years or whatever, but at some point, at least I'm hoping to

08:59.720 --> 09:00.880
see that.

09:00.880 --> 09:08.200
But what we've seen with UbiPorts and with postmarket OS is this is a deadline.

09:08.200 --> 09:12.040
When these devices are waiting to be shipped, you've got to get your image ready.

09:12.040 --> 09:16.640
And so instead of it being just a sort of, oh, well, we're developing it as it goes and

09:16.640 --> 09:20.560
we'll have these milestones here and there, this is a deadline.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.440
You've got to get something usable shipping on it.

09:23.440 --> 09:29.280
And Manjaro at the moment has a lot of potential and it's got Andbox pre-installed and it's

09:29.280 --> 09:32.600
looking really good, but there is a lot of work to do on it.

09:32.600 --> 09:39.720
And so I'm hoping that this community edition will force them to get everything sorted and

09:39.720 --> 09:43.640
push it forward and we'll get something that's really usable.

09:43.640 --> 09:47.360
But the thing about the PinePhone is that it doesn't really matter if it ships with

09:47.360 --> 09:49.900
something that's not 100%.

09:49.900 --> 09:52.320
These phones are aimed at tinkerers and hackers, right?

09:52.320 --> 09:56.140
And it's not difficult to get another operating system on there.

09:56.140 --> 10:02.560
So you end up with this kind of friendly competition amongst the various image makers for the PinePhone

10:02.560 --> 10:05.160
and they also all work together.

10:05.160 --> 10:11.000
And it's just a great hardware platform for those open source projects to work together.

10:11.000 --> 10:16.880
You may have touched on a significant realization about software development for these mobile

10:16.880 --> 10:22.880
platforms, which has been a huge challenge for open source for a decade now.

10:22.880 --> 10:27.600
And it is the inherent impact that shipping something has on software development.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.400
That is a huge aspect.

10:29.400 --> 10:35.380
This milestone, you have a deadline, it kind of creates this sprint mentality and people

10:35.380 --> 10:39.320
put in the extra work and they have to get it to a certain bar.

10:39.320 --> 10:44.360
And without that mechanism, it's sometimes just you'd never quite get there organically

10:44.360 --> 10:49.080
because it kind of requires a set of circumstances to get people compelled to do it.

10:49.080 --> 10:50.480
Well, that's the hope at least.

10:50.480 --> 10:55.680
And this is the experiment that we're seeing and fingers crossed, it has so far has gone

10:55.680 --> 10:56.680
pretty well.

10:56.680 --> 11:02.400
If you look at the state of UbiPorts, it's looking really good now on the PinePhone.

11:02.400 --> 11:07.320
What are your thoughts on this, as they call it a quote unquote scheme to donate $10 per

11:07.320 --> 11:13.040
unit sold back to the Mangero project or whoever the community image might be?

11:13.040 --> 11:18.000
I think it's a great idea in theory, but the margins are so low that I don't see how they

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
can afford to do it.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.800
But I guess if they can, it's great because it is an incentive for these communities to

11:24.800 --> 11:29.480
get together and make something that is worth shipping on a device.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.760
And it's a great way for people to support those projects.

11:31.760 --> 11:32.760
I agree.

11:32.760 --> 11:37.400
I'd check a box or I'd be totally happy if the $10 was just bundled in the price to give

11:37.400 --> 11:38.400
back.

11:38.400 --> 11:42.960
I think that's a great idea and it helps justify the project spending significant resources

11:42.960 --> 11:45.000
on getting it across the line.

11:45.000 --> 11:49.460
So the pre-orders for the Mangero Community Edition open mid-September and we'll have

11:49.460 --> 11:54.680
links in the show notes at linuxactionnews.com slash 153 if you want more information.

11:54.680 --> 11:59.360
There's also a Telegram Pine64 news channel that you can check out if you're a Telegram

11:59.360 --> 12:00.360
user.

12:00.360 --> 12:03.280
Well, while we're on the mobile topic, I just wanted to quickly mention something that I

12:03.280 --> 12:10.160
think is great news and that is that LineageOS is adding official support for the Pixel 2,

12:10.160 --> 12:13.880
3a, 4 and some other devices.

12:13.880 --> 12:20.520
This is 17.1 which is based on Android 10 and so now I think all of the Pixel phones

12:20.520 --> 12:25.560
apart from the very latest one, the Pixel 4a, have got official lineage support or at

12:25.560 --> 12:26.560
least will have soon.

12:26.560 --> 12:32.200
You know, the install on my Pixel 3 is getting to that old sort of feels super slow.

12:32.200 --> 12:36.800
You really feel it when you reboot it and it legitimately takes like an hour to kind

12:36.800 --> 12:38.880
of get itself going again.

12:38.880 --> 12:44.120
So I, you know, more than ever, am kind of looking over at LineageOS and going, how you

12:44.120 --> 12:45.120
doing over there?

12:45.120 --> 12:46.180
How's your Pixel 3 support?

12:46.180 --> 12:50.080
So let me know on Twitter if you use it on the Pixel 3 and how the support is like the

12:50.080 --> 12:52.960
Wi-Fi, the camera, the Bluetooth, all of that.

12:52.960 --> 12:58.120
And if you use it with Android Auto, I'd like to know as well at Chris Last on Twitter.

12:58.120 --> 13:03.520
Well, it is really easy to flash the stock image back onto it so you've got no excuses.

13:03.520 --> 13:15.040
I think you should just do it.

13:15.040 --> 13:20.240
If you're around Wi-Fi, then you really don't need to pay for a monthly set of data.

13:20.240 --> 13:25.020
Like myself here at the studio and at home, the only time I'm really not on Wi-Fi is when

13:25.020 --> 13:29.340
I'm doing my commute and I kind of look at that as a backup connection.

13:29.340 --> 13:36.400
Ting now offers LTE coverage on three nationwide providers, so you'll be able to use Ting wherever

13:36.400 --> 13:37.400
you are at.

13:37.400 --> 13:41.180
And one of the things that's fantastic since I was a Ting customer is they've now added

13:41.180 --> 13:44.580
Verizon Wireless as one of those providers.

13:44.580 --> 13:45.980
That brought me back.

13:45.980 --> 13:51.080
Ting offers LTE for several networks and the ability to choose is a powerful tool for me

13:51.080 --> 13:52.840
when I'm trying to get data on the road.

13:52.840 --> 13:54.720
And just about any phone will work on Ting.

13:54.720 --> 13:59.360
You can bring yours today and when you go to linux.ting.com, you'll get a $25 service

13:59.360 --> 14:00.360
credit.

14:00.360 --> 14:01.860
And you'll always be able to bring your phone number.

14:01.860 --> 14:03.060
You can port that.

14:03.060 --> 14:05.280
And there's tons of cool phones that you can buy from Ting.

14:05.280 --> 14:08.600
I love that they still have a flip phone available.

14:08.600 --> 14:13.520
It's like 70 bucks new, 75 bucks new, and it's a really simple device.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.800
And the more phones you have on Ting, the less you pay per phone since it's shared across

14:16.800 --> 14:17.800
your devices.

14:17.800 --> 14:18.800
That's really nice.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.800
It's just $6 a line.

14:19.800 --> 14:20.800
There's no contracts.

14:20.800 --> 14:22.120
There's no commitments.

14:22.120 --> 14:25.200
The average Ting bill is just $23 a month per phone.

14:25.200 --> 14:29.760
So you'll get a month of free service if you use linux.ting.com and get that $25 promo

14:29.760 --> 14:30.760
code.

14:30.760 --> 14:34.000
Head over to linux.ting.com, click on the check your phone, and see if your existing

14:34.000 --> 14:38.560
phone will work, linux.ting.com.

14:38.560 --> 14:42.000
Mozilla has been in the news quite a lot while we've been off air.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.460
And this week is no exception.

14:44.460 --> 14:48.700
They've released Firefox 80 for Android, which has addressed some of the concerns that people

14:48.700 --> 14:52.240
had about Firefox 79, but not all of them.

14:52.240 --> 14:55.920
Yeah, our year-end review episode is going to be really interesting.

14:55.920 --> 15:00.640
But as of currently, Mozilla rolled out Firefox 79 a bit ago, and they had a year's worth

15:00.640 --> 15:02.760
of changes baked into it.

15:02.760 --> 15:08.280
But that release was met with some criticism, which the folks over at xtadevelopers.com

15:08.280 --> 15:10.520
do a good job covering in their write-up.

15:10.520 --> 15:11.520
But I'll give you an example.

15:11.520 --> 15:16.240
Like for instance, Firefox 79 offered support for only a handful of extensions at launch,

15:16.240 --> 15:20.600
and it didn't include the about colon config page, which would kill me.

15:20.600 --> 15:25.440
Also, a lot of people had a botched password migration, and people didn't really like the

15:25.440 --> 15:28.500
tab switcher and the removal of the back button.

15:28.500 --> 15:32.920
So in an attempt to address these issues, Mozilla is rolling out Firefox 80 for Android.

15:32.920 --> 15:38.680
And one of the top line changes for Firefox 80 is the back button is back based on, quote,

15:38.680 --> 15:40.480
feedback from users.

15:40.480 --> 15:45.240
And I've been trying this out, 80, and it's not great.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.480
I don't want to say that.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.360
I want to say it's amazing.

15:48.360 --> 15:50.560
I don't need Chrome anymore.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.840
But it's just not that good.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.040
I had crashes.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.620
It was slow.

15:56.620 --> 15:59.240
And it's not just because I'm used to Chrome on Android.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.560
It just wasn't a great experience.

16:01.560 --> 16:08.040
And I've spoken to people who have been using Firefox for years on Android, and they say

16:08.040 --> 16:09.880
that 79 was just a disaster.

16:09.880 --> 16:14.960
80 is slightly better, but it's still nowhere near what it was before.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.760
It just seems like a misstep for Mozilla.

16:16.760 --> 16:23.240
I get why they did it, but I just think that if they had a year to get this right, they

16:23.240 --> 16:24.720
should have done a better job.

16:24.720 --> 16:25.720
Yeah, that's a shame.

16:25.720 --> 16:30.840
And when you say that I buy it, because you are a Firefox guy, so it really is your preferred

16:30.840 --> 16:32.240
browser to use if you can.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.800
Yeah, on the desktop, it's all about Firefox.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.720
I'm looking at it right now.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.800
Yeah, I hope they get this together.

16:38.800 --> 16:44.480
I feel like the wheels are coming off a little bit, because this criticism and the general

16:44.480 --> 16:49.560
state of Firefox mobile and some of the projects that they had in the oven, they all kind of

16:49.560 --> 16:52.080
feel like they were converging on improving the situation.

16:52.080 --> 16:56.080
But then a lot of the people involved, as we know, got laid off.

16:56.080 --> 17:00.200
And so it seems like while the product isn't at its best, they've also gotten rid of a

17:00.200 --> 17:04.320
lot of people that were working on the bits to make it better.

17:04.320 --> 17:09.040
And what we're left with now is maybe a little bit higher in the stack where we're going

17:09.040 --> 17:13.080
to get fixes and not some of the fundamentals that may actually be driving the core issues.

17:13.080 --> 17:15.760
But at least they've got that Google money now, eh?

17:15.760 --> 17:19.240
Maybe I mean, if that keeps it alive, honestly, I'm okay with it.

17:19.240 --> 17:20.680
I don't love it.

17:20.680 --> 17:26.960
But if Google continues to finance the leverage that allows the web to stay truly open, I

17:26.960 --> 17:28.400
can find peace with that.

17:28.400 --> 17:32.440
I just don't see Firefox on Android competing.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.640
It's just not good enough.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.280
I think that on the desktop, it is.

17:35.280 --> 17:38.920
I think that there are some things that Chrome does better, there are some things that Firefox

17:38.920 --> 17:39.920
does better.

17:39.920 --> 17:42.280
But ultimately, I think it's much of a muchness.

17:42.280 --> 17:46.800
There are certain websites that don't work in Firefox, but that's not necessarily Mozilla's

17:46.800 --> 17:47.800
fault.

17:47.800 --> 17:53.600
But for me, it's an easy choice on the desktop, that I will mostly use Firefox and then occasionally

17:53.600 --> 17:55.560
use Chrome for those things that I need.

17:55.560 --> 18:00.520
Whereas on Android, even someone who wants to use Firefox, I used it for a good couple

18:00.520 --> 18:01.520
of days.

18:01.520 --> 18:05.600
And in the end, I said to myself, I'd use it right up to recording and then see where

18:05.600 --> 18:06.600
we are.

18:06.600 --> 18:11.040
But in the end, it was at least a day or so ago that I just had enough, I just had to

18:11.040 --> 18:13.040
go back to using Chrome.

18:13.040 --> 18:18.820
And it's I just can't see people who don't care about software freedom at all, or even

18:18.820 --> 18:20.880
know what that means using it.

18:20.880 --> 18:24.700
And so I just I can't see them gaining any traction on mobile.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.400
And that is where most of the market is now.

18:27.400 --> 18:32.260
You look at the changes they're doing, particularly with mobile and the extension support.

18:32.260 --> 18:37.280
And it's not that I don't appreciate and understand the circumstance and logic.

18:37.280 --> 18:43.880
But I think ultimately, when you zoom out, what you see is, in response to Chrome's absolutely

18:43.880 --> 18:49.200
crushing market dominance, they just keep trying to go for the average consumer, they're

18:49.200 --> 18:51.600
trying to go for services and the average consumer.

18:51.600 --> 18:55.600
And when they look at the usage, they'll say something like, well, you know, in quote,

18:55.600 --> 19:00.480
a small number of our users were using this feature or something like that.

19:00.480 --> 19:06.000
And I guess I feel like the thing that they don't value is that market is the boosters,

19:06.000 --> 19:07.000
they're the advocates.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.720
They're like the most loyal army of Firefox users.

19:09.720 --> 19:12.400
They're the people that are going to tell their friends and family and I don't know

19:12.400 --> 19:15.880
how they expect browser adoption to work.

19:15.880 --> 19:19.380
It's not going to be about going straight at the average consumer.

19:19.380 --> 19:23.400
Because you can't compete with a Google ad on every single search result that suggests

19:23.400 --> 19:28.760
you try Chrome, or pop ups on Windows 10, encouraging you to set Edge as your default.

19:28.760 --> 19:31.580
As Firefox, they just can't compete with that.

19:31.580 --> 19:33.640
That's the lesson Netscape had to learn.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.560
And so they've got to go at the technical market.

19:35.560 --> 19:40.600
And that's why killing their developer tools and those parts of the company, to me, feel

19:40.600 --> 19:45.160
like when you combine that with what seems to be their on surface strategy of Firefox,

19:45.160 --> 19:48.440
it makes me think they truly don't get it.

19:48.440 --> 19:52.480
And they're just going to continue down this path of going after the mythical new user,

19:52.480 --> 19:57.000
that unicorn new user that understands what a web browser is and what the value is and

19:57.000 --> 20:01.900
replacing the web browser that comes baked into their operating system of choice, versus

20:01.900 --> 20:05.920
going after the technical crowd that's going to be the one deploying it for IT departments,

20:05.920 --> 20:08.520
or telling their friends and family to install it.

20:08.520 --> 20:12.680
I know it seems silly as a company to go after this tiny market, but this tiny market are

20:12.680 --> 20:16.000
your best advocates, and you keep turning away from them.

20:16.000 --> 20:21.840
And so my diagnosis is, they're just going to continue on more of the same now, and they

20:21.840 --> 20:25.720
will continue to decline, and we will end up in a mono browser culture.

20:25.720 --> 20:27.280
Well, we're there, aren't we?

20:27.280 --> 20:29.080
We are very nearly there.

20:29.080 --> 20:34.840
Our options are what, Chrome or Edge, basically, at this point, and I suppose Safari on the

20:34.840 --> 20:35.840
iPhone.

20:35.840 --> 20:38.880
I think that's pretty much it, and that's all WebKit or Blink.

20:38.880 --> 20:42.640
Yeah, I wish I had more positive things to say about it, but just from what I've seen

20:42.640 --> 20:48.160
from Mozilla, it feels like they need to really turn the corner somehow, and I just don't

20:48.160 --> 20:52.480
know what that's going to be, but we live in hope, I suppose.

20:52.480 --> 20:56.360
We may end up relearning the lessons from Internet Explorer.

20:56.360 --> 21:02.280
Speaking of lessons from the past, James Bottomley, who is the Linux SCSI subsystem maintainer,

21:02.280 --> 21:06.680
I'm familiar with his work on Secure Boot and Linux, but he's also a distinguished engineer

21:06.680 --> 21:12.880
at IBM Research, has put a post up that he has titled, Lessons from the Gnome Patent

21:12.880 --> 21:13.880
Troll Incident.

21:13.880 --> 21:19.000
Yeah, and he says that this description is somewhat brief and links to an article by

21:19.000 --> 21:24.440
Amanda Brock and Matt Berkovitz, which is a little bit more detailed, but this, I think,

21:24.440 --> 21:31.080
is a really good write-up of what happened with it all, because if you recall, Gnome

21:31.080 --> 21:36.640
faced a legal challenge from Rothschild patent imaging over Shotwell, over what was quite

21:36.640 --> 21:43.960
a spurious patent claim, and Gnome settled with Rothschild, but it wasn't made public

21:43.960 --> 21:48.980
what exactly happened there, but there was enough leeway in the settlement for someone

21:48.980 --> 21:54.160
to make it public, and now that's exactly what James has done with this post.

21:54.160 --> 21:58.940
And it's pretty much what most people expected, I think, but it is interesting to see the

21:58.940 --> 21:59.940
details of it.

21:59.940 --> 22:03.840
Yeah, he happened to be in just the perfect legal position.

22:03.840 --> 22:08.000
The Gnome Foundation folks and the Shotwell folks, they couldn't release these details

22:08.000 --> 22:13.780
themselves, but James can do it because he's released software under an OSI-approved license,

22:13.780 --> 22:18.020
so he's covered by the release and thus entitled to a copy of the agreement under Section 10,

22:18.020 --> 22:21.800
but he's not partied any of the covenants, which means he's not forbidden from disclosing

22:21.800 --> 22:22.800
it.

22:22.800 --> 22:26.200
It's in the perfect spot, and so he has linked it right at the top of his blog.

22:26.200 --> 22:29.180
That right there, full stop, is news.

22:29.180 --> 22:32.760
If this was the entirety of this story, this is actually a pretty big deal because there

22:32.760 --> 22:37.620
are a lot of lessons you can learn by just going through this as an open source project,

22:37.620 --> 22:43.080
but what's fantastic is he also did an analysis of the attack, and some of this won't surprise

22:43.080 --> 22:44.080
you.

22:44.080 --> 22:48.320
He writes a key element of the attack is to offer a settlement licensing for the sum less

22:48.320 --> 22:53.600
than it would cost to even get a defense going, a legal defense, which is going to be base,

22:53.600 --> 22:57.540
if you're lucky, $50,000, which is how they make money, right, because projects don't

22:57.540 --> 23:01.320
have that kind of money around, and they'll just say, well, why don't we settle?

23:01.320 --> 23:06.000
It's going to be cheaper than going to court, and you will go to court.

23:06.000 --> 23:11.460
One of the problems he writes is that when a patent is issued by the US Patent Office,

23:11.460 --> 23:17.920
the court must presume it is valid, so any case that impunges the validity of the patent

23:17.920 --> 23:23.040
can't be decided as a summary judgment, i.e. it has to go to court.

23:23.040 --> 23:28.300
In the Gnome case that sued the Project Shotwell, the thing is, even there, Shotwell predated

23:28.300 --> 23:33.440
the filing of the patent by several years, so just on its face, it should have been obvious

23:33.440 --> 23:40.620
that it wasn't valid, but because the court must presume they're valid, you go, and simply

23:40.620 --> 23:44.840
put, it means you're spending money, and probably you're lucky if you're going to get out for

23:44.840 --> 23:47.700
under $100,000.

23:47.700 --> 23:51.520
And in the case of Shotwell, the Gnome Foundation stepped up in a really big way, but they also

23:51.520 --> 23:57.660
had some generous backers come in and offer some legal support, and the community.

23:57.660 --> 24:01.260
And if it wasn't for that, they probably would have had to settle.

24:01.260 --> 24:06.340
And this is, it's just, it's this weak attack that they come after these projects with,

24:06.340 --> 24:09.580
knowing that you can't even afford to take it to court.

24:09.580 --> 24:12.060
Yeah, no wonder everyone settles.

24:12.060 --> 24:16.420
And it just shows how broken the patent system is, at least the software patent system is

24:16.420 --> 24:17.420
in the US.

24:17.420 --> 24:20.380
Yeah, it really doesn't seem like it works for this particular thing.

24:20.380 --> 24:24.260
There were some compromises, and those are outlined in this post, which you can go read

24:24.260 --> 24:29.380
here, but the big takeaway high-level lesson is that troll-based attacks are going to continue

24:29.380 --> 24:34.760
to be a threat to open source, and the one source, Rothschild, may have been neutralized,

24:34.760 --> 24:37.700
but others seem like they're going to be following this MO.

24:37.700 --> 24:40.980
And maybe one of the bigger lessons to take from this is if these attacks aren't going

24:40.980 --> 24:45.540
away, then we need to figure out some way to fund projects so they are not forced into

24:45.540 --> 24:46.600
settling.

24:46.600 --> 24:52.340
Maybe it's some sort of community funding that's held by a foundation, something like

24:52.340 --> 24:55.140
this, because otherwise these trolls can just roll in knowing that most of these projects

24:55.140 --> 24:56.140
can't afford this.

24:56.140 --> 25:00.740
And if there's a defense fund that's set up in public and ready to go, like we did 16

25:00.740 --> 25:04.740
years ago when SCO was threatening to sue Linux users, we could potentially do that

25:04.740 --> 25:05.740
again.

25:05.740 --> 25:09.120
And just having that war chest there may prevent companies like Rothschild Patent Imaging from

25:09.120 --> 25:10.120
even trying.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.120
Maybe.

25:11.120 --> 25:12.120
Maybe.

25:12.120 --> 25:16.120
But as we saw with BountySource, hanging onto money is not easy.

25:16.120 --> 25:19.540
It's kind of relatively straightforward if you've got money coming in and out, but if

25:19.540 --> 25:24.600
it's just money sitting in an account, it makes accounting for that money pretty tricky.

25:24.600 --> 25:29.940
So it would need a proper organization to manage it.

25:29.940 --> 25:34.740
You can't just have a bunch of people stick money in a PayPal account or whatever.

25:34.740 --> 25:37.460
It takes a lot to get this sorted.

25:37.460 --> 25:42.520
So maybe it is someone like Misr, maybe the Linux Foundation, someone with some clout

25:42.520 --> 25:47.020
and respect in the open source industry needs to organize this, I think.

25:47.020 --> 25:49.900
Because otherwise, we're just going to get blindsided again.

25:49.900 --> 25:50.900
It's fine.

25:50.900 --> 25:54.980
You just hosted on an AWS bottle rocket with blockchain, Joe.

25:54.980 --> 25:55.980
Blockchain.

25:55.980 --> 25:57.980
That's all I got to say, right?

25:57.980 --> 25:58.980
Blockchain.

25:58.980 --> 25:59.980
Yeah, that's a good idea, actually.

25:59.980 --> 26:00.980
Just invest it all in Bitcoin.

26:00.980 --> 26:01.980
Right.

26:01.980 --> 26:02.980
That'll definitely work out.

26:02.980 --> 26:03.980
Yeah, what could go wrong?

26:03.980 --> 26:05.020
So bottle rocket's a real thing.

26:05.020 --> 26:09.340
It's Amazon's new open source Linux distribution that's built to run containers.

26:09.340 --> 26:14.300
It's designed, they say, to improve security and operations for a containerized infrastructure.

26:14.300 --> 26:19.580
And they've done some obvious things here, like use SE Linux and the natural isolations

26:19.580 --> 26:22.680
you get from using namespaces and whatnot with the Linux kernel.

26:22.680 --> 26:26.040
But they're also doing other things that I think are kind of neat, like they're using

26:26.040 --> 26:30.400
device mappers, Verity Target, a Linux kernel feature that provides integrity checking to

26:30.400 --> 26:31.940
help prevent attackers.

26:31.940 --> 26:33.620
They're disabling root logins.

26:33.620 --> 26:38.320
They actually kind of build this whole thing to be centrally managed and discourage administrators

26:38.320 --> 26:40.900
actually connecting directly into it.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.960
It has a lot of similarities to other projects trying to solve this.

26:43.960 --> 26:48.580
But the implication here in this announcement is this has been built based on the needs

26:48.580 --> 26:52.100
they've observed of AWS customers directly.

26:52.100 --> 26:56.140
Now I wasn't particularly interested in this when I first read about it because I thought,

26:56.140 --> 27:00.080
well, it's just an AWS thing and no one's going to benefit from it.

27:00.080 --> 27:05.660
But then reading into it a bit more, you find out that it's your choice of either MIT or

27:05.660 --> 27:09.540
Apache license and the whole thing is open source.

27:09.540 --> 27:14.000
How useful it's going to be outside of AWS, I don't know.

27:14.000 --> 27:19.140
If you plan to use this on prem or on a different cloud provider, then do let us know, linuxactionnews.com

27:19.140 --> 27:20.320
slash contact.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.080
They're fully taking advantage of GitHub with this one.

27:22.080 --> 27:26.960
The project's up there, the issue tracker, their can board with their future project

27:26.960 --> 27:28.080
issues on there.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.440
And the thing that I thought was interesting is a lot of the stuff above the kernel that

27:31.440 --> 27:33.360
they've written is all been done in Rust.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.400
Yeah, I thought that would catch your eye.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.960
Well, that brings us to the end of this week's news.
