00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 260, recorded on September 28, 2022, from

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,240
a very sunny Pasadena, California.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,240
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,240
And I'm Wes.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,240
Hello, Wes.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,960
From the footsteps of JPL, let's do the news.

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,600
This week, the GNU Toolchain infrastructure project was established.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,400
The project will take advantage of the Linux Foundation's Kernel Infrastructure team to

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,000
provide hosting for the GNU tools.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,560
Yes, Carlos O'Donnell of Red Hat summed it up in a mailing list post, saying, quote,

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,440
during the Sourceware Infrastructure BoF sessions at the GNU Cauldron, the GNU Toolchain community

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,040
in collaboration with the Linux Foundation and OpenSSF announced the GNU Toolchain Infrastructure

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,960
project, or what everybody likes to call GTI.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,560
He went on to say, quote, the collaboration includes a fund for infrastructure and software

15
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,360
supply chain security, which will allow us to utilize the respected Linux Foundation

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,520
IT services that currently host Kernel.org, and to fund other important projects.

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,580
And to be fair, that does seem like the Kernel team is quite happy with the infrastructure

18
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,800
that is provided for Kernel.org.

19
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:25,760
To not understand this entire situation, you have to realize that for the past two decades,

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,740
Red Hat has been sponsoring the hosting of the GCC compiler and the related GNU Toolchain

21
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:33,600
infrastructure at Sourceware.org.

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,580
Recently, an application was made to bring Sourceware under the umbrella of the Software

23
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,940
Freedom Conservancy, at least for fundraising purposes.

24
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:48,100
But it turns out there was a separate initiative developed in secret.

25
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:53,960
This was all revealed after a rather intense discussion during a GNU Tools Cauldron session

26
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,280
at the recent Linux Plumbers conference.

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,020
Now nominally, the session was going to be about some new services that were being worked

28
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,040
on for Sourceware.

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,240
But the presenter, Sourceware overseer Mark Wheelard, did not end up getting very far

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:14,880
into that presentation before being interrupted and reminded of an agreement, evidently made

31
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,520
ahead of the session, that the real focus would be on the SFC proposal.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,800
At least according to Mark, representatives of the projects that are currently hosted

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,940
on Sourceware, well they seem to like the SFC proposal.

34
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,020
The Free Software Foundation does as well.

35
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,280
Now we should note, there was some yelling from the audience at this point, and it seems

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,480
to make it clear there is a little disagreement left on that point.

37
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
This is all sounding bizarre.

38
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:48,920
I mean, it's a technical session with shouting from the audience and secret plans being announced.

39
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,920
It's very odd.

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,720
And at this point, O'Donnell finally revealed the secret alternative plan to the rest of

41
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:57,860
the group, stressing these challenges that were coming for the toolchain community.

42
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,800
They're going to require resources beyond what the Software Freedom Conservancy, or

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,400
the SFC, could provide.

44
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,800
Specifically, he talked about cybersecurity requirements that could lead to the exclusion

45
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:15,600
of GNU tools from important projects, at least if its development systems are not seen as

46
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,600
being managed in a sufficiently secure manner.

47
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,280
Details on exactly what those requirements might be, or how they could be met, were not

48
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,800
provided at the time.

49
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,840
Though O'Donnell did note that the toolchain development model seems to function a lot

50
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,280
like the Linux Kernels model, so there really could be some value in taking advantage of

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,920
the infrastructure that the Linux Foundation has already set up to support the kernel.

52
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,520
Yeah, no doubt.

53
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,480
And I think it's important to note at this stage that these changes do not alter the

54
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,560
governance or leadership structure of the GNU projects.

55
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,440
This isn't about governance at all.

56
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,740
It's really about infrastructure and just offloading the work of managing that infrastructure

57
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,280
to someone else.

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:04,240
Yeah, and on that point, I mean, from the busy developer perspective, I can definitely

59
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,080
see the appeal.

60
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,080
The problem seems to be the way that GTI was developed, somewhat in secret, and then is

61
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,360
just surprisingly revealed.

62
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,840
Really does seem to have caused some considerable consternation, at least in some elements of

63
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,720
the toolchain community.

64
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,440
So you know, regardless of whatever burdens that might be alleviated, however much easier

65
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,660
you make it for them, I'm not sure everyone is able to forget the origin of the proposal

66
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,540
so easily.

67
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,000
And it's just once again, one of those things that involves the Linux Foundation that has

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
some good.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,300
Obviously, that kernel.org infrastructure has been a good thing for Linux, that management

70
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,820
has been solid.

71
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,560
But the way it's gone about with these secret plans and how seemingly most of the project

72
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,680
was on board with going with the conservancy, and then this big change, it all seems a little

73
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
unsettling, doesn't it?

74
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,820
And I thought Jonathan Colbert from LWN really nailed it when he wrote, quote, the secretive

75
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:07,380
way this project has been handled is a poor example of how to deal with a community.

76
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,960
Regardless of what reality may be, GTI looks to a number of people involved like a murky,

77
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:22,160
hostile takeover of an important piece of community infrastructure.

78
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,900
It's been quite a while since we last checked in on a mobile Linux effort.

79
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,940
So we wanted to catch you up on some work from July through September for Plasma Mobile

80
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,560
Gear.

81
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,100
Some of these updates are pretty major, and others are just nice to see, like the addition

82
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:46,480
of a clear all notifications button and a do not disturb quick setting.

83
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,720
I consider that a pretty major feature right there.

84
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,760
It was great to just see all this work come together.

85
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,820
There was work that went into making it possible as well to install Plasma Mobile alongside

86
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:02,360
Plasma desktop and streamline some of the configurations between them as well.

87
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,120
That's going to be absolutely essential for developers that are building apps for this.

88
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,060
Also great to see some good stuff for podcast listeners.

89
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,980
The interface in the podcast app has gotten some nice improvements, including the way

90
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,140
the episode pages list and the information within is listed.

91
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,000
Some reworking there that helps with sleep timer functionality, but here's a good one.

92
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,900
They've added the possibility to push all local episode states to a G Potter sync server.

93
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:32,660
So you can sync the state of your pods across your multiple Plasma Mobile devices.

94
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:38,740
Of course, any mobile operating system needs support for phone calls, and this time around

95
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,060
Plasma Mobile Gear definitely got some improvements there, including improved support for screening

96
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:50,380
incoming calls and some lock screen overlay support for that call screening, plus more

97
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,160
reliable behavior when you're accepting calls showing notifications about calls and importantly

98
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,860
switching call audio modes automatically.

99
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,260
They've also introduced a new swipe control to easily answer calls.

100
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,720
That all seems like pretty good stuff.

101
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,520
But catch this one there Westpain.

102
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,280
They've also introduced some really clever support for call blocking of unknown numbers.

103
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,400
And it makes it possible to change the notification logic according to the address book, or if

104
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,820
a number matches a certain pattern.

105
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:21,180
I'd like to have that on my commercial phone right now.

106
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,540
Just mark everything as spam.

107
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,020
I mean, sure, this isn't going to replace your daily driver just yet.

108
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:34,860
But thank goodness a team of people are working away at this.

109
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,820
Solid progress to report for the Asahi Rust based direct rendering manager video driver

110
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,940
for Linux on that shiny Apple M hardware.

111
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:51,740
Finally that driver successfully managed to render its very first cube.

112
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,060
This is a milestone.

113
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,620
They reached it this past week and Asahi Lina has been working on bringing up this new driver

114
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:03,420
and just recently managed to also get the display working over the HDMI port with the

115
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,220
driver as well.

116
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:11,420
And to make things even more exciting, it appears Wayland support is well underway.

117
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:17,340
Tweeting early on the 28th of September, Asahi Lina says KDE isn't starting all the way up

118
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,020
just yet, but Wayland, quote, works.

119
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:26,460
Hey, I have that problem on my x86 system sometimes, so not so bad.

120
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,660
Let's be real though, it's going to be months.

121
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,420
And then it's going to be even more time until it's in the hands of end users.

122
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:38,340
And that's all to say nothing about the fact that Rust support hasn't even landed in the

123
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:50,100
Linux kernel yet, but it will be landing soon, and we'll have more on that in the near future.

124
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,140
An important security item for our friends in the Matrix Fediverse this week.

125
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,700
Two critical vulnerabilities in end-to-end encryption were found in some of the SDKs

126
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,340
which power Element and many other popular clients.

127
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,780
These have now been fixed, and thankfully the Matrix team have not seen any evidence

128
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,360
of these exploits being used in the wild.

129
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,740
To make it even a little better, all the critical vulnerabilities actually require cooperation

130
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,940
from a malicious home server in order to be exploited.

131
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:26,580
We should also note that this is not a bug in the protocol, just a bug in some of the

132
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,940
SDKs used by a lot of clients.

133
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:36,220
Because of that, not all clients are affected, so go check with yours, but the Matrix team

134
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,660
have used this as an opportunity to underscore their ongoing efforts to replace some of these

135
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:49,860
first-generation SDKs with a new, clean, carefully written Rust implementation, complete with

136
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,700
an independent public audit.

137
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,740
But until that glorious future comes, patched clients are available now.

138
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,300
Go get those package updates.

139
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,500
Linode.com slash LAN.

140
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,920
You go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account, and what a great way to

141
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,140
support the show, right?

142
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,180
Because you're letting them know you heard about it here, but you also get to check out

143
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,180
something awesome.

144
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,580
And $100, well that's real money that you can do something with.

145
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,780
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

146
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,580
I think they're the best in the business, and they have the best support in the business.

147
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,460
Real humans, all day, every day, and really nobody else has architected their business

148
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,700
the way Linode has to make that possible.

149
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,500
And Linode's how we run everything we've built in the last few years in the cloud, including

150
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:39,260
that new website of ours, if you haven't checked it out yet, that renders, builds, and is deployed

151
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
on Linode.

152
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:45,580
You know, they started about 19 years ago, and they've just built a great product.

153
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,580
And now they've got a great reputation, and they're 30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers

154
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,580
out there.

155
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,780
But that doesn't mean you skimp on the features.

156
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:57,860
Linode today has 11 data centers around the world for you to choose from.

157
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,100
But my friends, they are turning it up past 11 in 2023.

158
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:08,320
They are going to introduce 12 new data centers around the world.

159
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,700
And I'm happy as a West Coaster, I'm happy to say that Seattle is going to have one of

160
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,080
these data centers.

161
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,780
But they're literally all over the world.

162
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:22,160
Many places from Amsterdam, Stockholm, I mean, Paris, just tons of places, Rome, it's going

163
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,400
to be a dozen.

164
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,180
And then they're also working on a brand new concept called distributed sites, where they've

165
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,260
identified 50 additional cities, where they're going to introduce a new concept where you

166
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,740
can get basic computes in difficult to reach locations.

167
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,460
Linode is always investing in making the service and the product better, the hardware, the

168
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,460
support, and the reach.

169
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:46,980
And on top of that, they have great back end features, like S3 compatible object storage,

170
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:53,060
cloud firewall, great backups, Kubernetes support, super fast networking, and so much

171
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,060
more.

172
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,780
So go build something, go learn something, try it out for yourself, and support the show.

173
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,500
You just go to linode.com slash LAN to get that $100 in 60 day credit, kick the tires

174
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
for yourself.

175
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:12,660
One more time to support the show, linode.com slash LAN.

176
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,580
collide.com slash LAN.

177
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:22,060
Collide is endpoint security that uses the most powerful untapped resource in IT, the

178
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,060
end users.

179
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,060
Yes, that's right.

180
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,180
If you're trying to achieve security goals for yourself, for a third party auditor, for

181
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,880
the new boss, I've had to do it for the FDA, for the FCC, for the FBI, okay, maybe not

182
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,880
the FBI.

183
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,060
But you get the idea.

184
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:39,420
The conventional wisdom has been to treat every device like it's Fort Knox, go all in

185
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,900
on security with old device management stuff like MDMs that force disruptive agents onto

186
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:50,400
employees devices, slow them down, and treat privacy as an afterthought.

187
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,940
To say it politely, not to mention, they'll often introduce their own security vulnerabilities.

188
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,340
Like how many times have we seen that every single time?

189
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:01,860
It's just a tired old way of doing things.

190
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,180
And I can tell you from personal experience, it turns IT admins and end users into enemies.

191
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:13,000
It creates security problems, users don't like it, IT staff always look at it as a compromise,

192
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and eventually creates a culture of shadow IT.

193
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,500
It's awful.

194
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,340
Kalyde does things differently, instead of forcing changes on its users, Kalyde sends

195
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,900
them security recommendations via slack, Kalyde will automatically notify your team when their

196
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:32,020
devices are insecure and give them step by step instructions on how to solve the problem.

197
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,980
And by reaching out to employees via a friendly slack DM and educating them about company

198
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:42,780
policies, Kalyde can help you build a culture in which everyone contributes to security

199
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,060
because everyone understands how and why to do it.

200
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,220
Even for IT admins, Kalyde provides a single dashboard that lets you monitor the security

201
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,080
of your entire fleet.

202
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,160
Even if they're on a Mac, Windows, or of course Linux, you can see at a glance which

203
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,540
employees have their disks encrypted, their OS up to date, and a password manager installed.

204
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,220
Make it easy to prove compliance to yourself, your auditors, your customers, leadership,

205
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,780
you get the idea.

206
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:16,700
That's Kalyde, user-centered cross-platform endpoint security for teams that slack.

207
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,820
You can meet your compliance goals by putting users first.

208
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,260
Visit Kalyde.com slash LAN to find out how.

209
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,780
You go there, they're going to hook you up with a goody bag, including a free t-shirt

210
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,420
just for trying out a free trial.

211
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,060
So I mean, free t-shirt y'all.

That's Kalyde.com slash LAN.

214
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:47,780
We're visiting NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory this week to celebrate the incredible achievements

215
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:51,180
of Linux in modern space exploration.

216
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:58,840
So it's rather fitting the Linux powered Mars helicopter Ingenuity completed its 33rd flight

217
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,560
this week.

218
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,560
That's just amazing.

219
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,440
And currently it's around 96 million miles away from where we sit right now.

220
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:12,580
The little Linux copter originally only had five flights planned.

221
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,940
So the fact that hit 33 is just incredible.

222
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:18,220
At the time when they launched this thing, expectations were low.

223
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,140
I mean, keep in mind there's Mars itself.

224
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,420
It only has three eighths Earth's gravity.

225
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:30,540
It also has a much thinner atmosphere, 1.5% of Earth's atmospheric density, 1.5%.

226
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,220
Imagine flying in that.

227
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:37,260
And then to make matters worse, Mars only has 43% of the solar radiance.

228
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,580
So charging batteries is tricky.

229
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,300
And there's just a bunch of other variables on another planet where we've never flown

230
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,360
before that made this a big unknown.

231
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,380
So things started humbly with a little Linux copter, simple, basic, essential tests were

232
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,380
done one bit at a time during one of the high speed spin tests back in early April.

233
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,380
In fact, there was a problem.

234
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,020
They had to shut it down.

235
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,340
There was a watchdog service because, of course, this thing's running Linux and they got watch

236
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,880
guard services on there.

237
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,740
And it noticed there was too long of a delay between the transition between the pre flight

238
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,260
and the flight system.

239
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,740
So it called foul and shut everything down.

240
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:19,020
But the team was capable of fixing that from Earth with a very remote software update.

241
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,380
After that really seems like things have been mainly for the most part by the numbers with

242
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,420
these flights, with the team pushing things a bit further and getting more data and cool

243
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,660
pictures every single time.

244
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:35,740
But in the last few months, there's been concern because Mars is in the middle of winter and

245
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,100
it gets real cold on Mars.

246
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,060
Yes, it does.

247
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:48,400
Overnight temperatures can get as low as negative 124 degrees Fahrenheit, negative 86 Celsius.

248
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:54,580
Winter on Mars also means even less of that limited solar energy you mentioned hitting

249
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,940
those cute little solar panels.

250
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,300
And that makes it difficult to maintain charge in the batteries.

251
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,620
Though good news during the day, the panel creates just enough energy to make short hops

252
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,620
possible.

253
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:15,780
And that's how 33 flights later now, amazingly, Linux's role in the future of space exploration

254
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,580
is pretty much guaranteed.

255
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:25,700
And this week, JPL's expertise was on call once again for the asteroid striking DART

256
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,700
mission.

257
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
Wow.

258
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
Yeah.

259
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Oh, my goodness.

260
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Yeah.

261
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,700
Seven.

262
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,700
Six.

263
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Wow.

264
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
Four.

265
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,700
Three.

266
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
Two.

267
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
One.

268
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
Oh, my gosh.

269
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,700
Oh, wow.

270
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
Visual confirmation.

271
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,700
All right.

272
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,700
We got it.

273
00:17:42,700 --> 00:18:03,700
And we have impact, a challenge for humanity in the name of planetary defense.

274
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,900
Fantastic.

275
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,140
Planetary defense indeed.

276
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:14,900
DART stands for Double Asteroid Redirection Test, and, well, it seeks to develop a method

277
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,380
to protect our beloved Earth in case of a future asteroid impact threat.

278
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,260
How does it do it?

279
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:29,460
Well, actually pretty simply, just by shifting the asteroid's orbit through kinetic impact.

280
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:38,100
Launched back in November 2021, DART is approximately 600 kilograms, and it had to fly 6.8 million

281
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:47,180
miles away all to slam into the asteroid Dimorphos, which is just 160 meters across.

282
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:53,140
It's a difficult job, said JPL's Julie Belrose, who leads the DART spacecraft navigation team.

283
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,020
She went on to say, quote, it's a big part of what the navigation team is working on.

284
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:03,260
It's getting DART to a 15 kilometer wide box in space 24 hours before impact.

285
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,460
At that point, the mission's final trajectory correction maneuver, aka the firing of thrusters

286
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,100
to modify the direction of flight, that'll be executed by mission controllers back here

287
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,140
on Earth.

288
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:19,540
But from then on, it was all up to DART.

289
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,260
Yeah, the thing flew itself right into the rock.

290
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:26,420
The autonomous navigation system is fascinating, and it's a particular area of interest for

291
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,900
Wes and I that we hope to get a little more information about when we visit JPL in the

292
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,900
next day.

293
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:36,740
But watching Linux become the dominant operating system of space, it's just been fascinating

294
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,100
and so encouraging to watch.

295
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,540
We're going to keep an eye on this and everything else going on in the world of Linux and all

296
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,540
open source.

297
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:48,500

don't miss lucky number 13 of office hours, we have the deets.

301
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,220
As for us, well, don't worry, we'll be back next week with our usual take on the latest

302
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:10,260
Linux and open source news.
