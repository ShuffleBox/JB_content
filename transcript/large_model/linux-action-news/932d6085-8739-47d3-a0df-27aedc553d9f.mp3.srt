00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 143, recorded on February 2nd, 2020.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,440
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,440
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,440
Hello, Joe.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,440
Good to be connected with you.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,080
Huge week, a lot to jump into.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's start with Qt's changes.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,480
No, not changes that are Qt, but changes from Qt.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,840
Yeah, we're talking about the toolkit that Plasma's based on, sometimes called Qt, from

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,240
the Qt company, formerly Trolltech.

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,360
To kick the new year off with some big changes, they write on their blog, to support the continuous

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,120
growth required to keep Qt as a development platform relevant, we need to make changes

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,120
to our offering.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,740
One, installing of Qt binaries will require a Qt account, a.k.a. you'll have to get a

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:49,420
user ID and password, and you'll have to log in to get to them.

16
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:55,080
Their long-term supported LTS releases and their offline installer will only be available

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,160
to commercial licensees, and the new Qt offering for startups and small businesses will be

18
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,160
launched.

19
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,140
It'll be a special price point at $499 a year.

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,680
This could put the open source community in a bad situation.

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,120
Because if I'm reading this right, Joe, bug fixes will be going to the LTS versions or

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,960
the latest development releases of Qt.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,800
In other words, say you're building Corita or KDN Live, you either need to license the

24
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,000
long-term support versions of Qt and get bug fixes on that, which at a minimum would be

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
$499.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,220
However, I think the Corita Foundation looked into it, and at a budget of $125,000 a year,

27
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,320
they make too much to get that $499 price point.

28
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,780
So who really knows how much they have to pay?

29
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:48,180
So they either pay an untold amount of money to get the long-term support version, or they

30
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,220
ride that development wave and they stay absolutely current.

31
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,280
So here's the thing to consider, we're not that far away from Qt 6.

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,600
And then what do we do?

33
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,640
Does everybody just jump to this brand new release?

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,840
Because the older versions, except for the LTS, as far as I understand this, won't be

35
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,840
getting bug fixes.

36
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,100
Well, that seems to be the situation.

37
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,280
And so surely there are only two possible conclusions to this.

38
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,860
Either Qt will be forked and maintained by the community or someone else, and people

39
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:26,380
will just use that and not necessarily contribute to the original Qt, or the Qt company is going

40
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,220
to have to backpedal on this.

41
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,100
And that seems more likely to me.

42
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,540
I'm pretty sure there's already a serious contender from the community in the works.

43
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,660
I don't know much about it, so I don't want to speak out of turn.

44
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,420
But it seems that the developers are already actively considering that.

45
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,160
I'm left pondering long term what the Qt company's business model is here.

46
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,260
They were already on fragile terms with the open source community's understanding of what

47
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,060
the licensing requirements are.

48
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,780
I've seen them upset developers over changing the rules.

49
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,320
And now this, it just wasn't a step in the right direction.

50
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,180
On the Qt project mailing list, Nikola Marchenko nailed what the new business model is.

51
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,780
And it just sums up my concerns.

52
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,680
He writes, Qt is becoming your average AAA game.

53
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,260
They're essentially selling us time savers.

54
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,460
Most of the attached value of the commercial license isn't something that is inherent to

55
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:21,580
the license, but stuff that everyone could do anyway, just with a lot of effort.

56
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,760
They are selling us the solution to a problem that they are the ones that are creating in

57
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
the first place.

58
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,600
He's talking about these things are going to be selling through the marketplace, which

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,300
is the real reason they want you to create an account.

60
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,180
They say they want you to create an account because it will encourage open source community

61
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,060
members to contribute if they already have an account.

62
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,340
And it opens up a dialogue with businesses.

63
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,220
But the real reason is because it also gets you an account in their marketplace.

64
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,160
Here's what they're offering developers now, a login requirement that you have to get credentials

65
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,020
for, no offline packages, you have to spend time compiling Qt with your own system, no

66
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,980
LTS support unless you buy it, or go find one of the community forks that will undoubtedly

67
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,260
be created around their own LTS fork.

68
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,860
And it's all possible to do all of that without paying.

69
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,080
So they're just asking you, pay us some money and we'll solve these problems for you that

70
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,400
we just created.

71
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,180
And they're not even really doing it right.

72
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,620
Because it's not something you couldn't solve.

73
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,960
It's not some unsolvable problem without their help.

74
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,140
It's something if you just put a little time and effort into it and go find the right stuff

75
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,140
in the community.

76
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,620
Yeah, I'll solve it.

77
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,980
Also, there's alternatives to Qt now that are getting less buggy and more efficient

78
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,460
as Qt gets bigger.

79
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,340
I just don't know what they're thinking here.

80
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,940
It's so disappointing because I know it's something that is so useful.

81
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,640
It has been impressive to watch the plasma desktop build off of these technologies.

82
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,620
And all of the great Qt applications in that ecosystem have just in the last five years

83
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,100
have just gotten better and more feature rich and more stable.

84
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,960
So it's a real punch to the gut to see stuff like this.

85
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,220
So what do you see happening here?

86
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,580
Do you think they'll backpedal like I do?

87
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,580
I don't.

88
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,980
I don't think they'll backpedal.

89
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,980
I wish they would.

90
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,740
But I think the community will adapt and they'll come up with their own solutions.

91
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:12,100
But I think upstairs in the tower of the Qt company, they're looking at their businesses

92
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,140
there, their papers in Finland, and they're saying to ourselves, you know what?

93
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,820
Our headcount in the last year increased from 295 to 339.

94
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,960
And our revenue, all our charts show things are growing.

95
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,460
Our open source strategy is working because look at this.

96
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,780
Our revenues are going up.

97
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,280
Our company is growing.

98
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,380
More Qt is in deployment than ever.

99
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,380
Everything's great.

100
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,380
But you have to wonder how long it's going to keep going well for them if they keep making

101
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,780
decisions like this.

102
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, Linus thought it was a good decision to release Linux 5.5.

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,280
And he says, quote, it was a pretty quiet week.

104
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,380
If this is Linus's version of quiet, I don't want to know his version of crazy busy.

105
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,860
There's a lot of stuff in here that I personally am very pleased to see land in the Linux kernel.

106
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,980
Well, yeah, one of the huge ones is mainline support for the Raspberry Pi 4.

107
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,020
Yeah, that's great.

108
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,300
I'm hearing that I have a handful of them.

109
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,540
Also temperature info from MVME SSDs.

110
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,540
That's pretty great.

111
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:17,620
But the one that really tickles me is I have a seven year old Logitech G15 gaming keyboard

112
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,360
that actually runs Linux itself and has a little display on it.

113
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,660
And support for that sucker landed thanks to a Red Hat engineer in 5.5.

114
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,500
I'm going to go take that thing out of the closet.

115
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
No way.

116
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,860
I didn't think that anyone would have one still from 15 years ago.

117
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,860
It's like a surfboard.

118
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,080
It is a serious little machine in there and it gets warm.

119
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:44,340
Also kind of cool to see some code from System76 landing in the Linux kernel.

120
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,900
Yeah, the ACPI driver.

121
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,820
And I noticed that too and thought, that's cool that they're getting some stuff upstreamed.

122
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,380
But I do have to correct you on your pronunciation of NVME as usual.

123
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,380
Did I get it wrong again?

124
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,380
I really tried this time.

125
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,700
I know you tried.

126
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,180
But that one kind of scares me because it means I'm probably gonna have to buy a heat

127
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,060
sink when I see how hot mine is running.

128
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,300
I can see the telegrams now.

129
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,620
You think this is right?

130
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,620
Check yours.

131
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,620
What's your temperature at?

132
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,620
Yeah.

133
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,940
And good news for you, Joe.

134
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,420
They landed Thunderbolt 3 support for Macs in this kernel.

135
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,900
I know your brand new MacBook Pro is going to need that.

136
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:24,700
My Core 2 Joe or MacBook Pro has got USB 2, I think, and some sort of FireWire.

137
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,860
I think that's already all supported.

138
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,780
Oh, you got FireWire on that thing.

139
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,780
Oh, yeah.

140
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,500
I'm a big fan of FireWire.

141
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,140
I do really like this kernel.

142
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:44,060
However, I can't help but look at the new Shiny because Linux 5.6 is on track to mainline

143
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,500
WireGuard.

144
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:53,020
It's in Linus's tree right now, and there is such an unlikely chance it's gonna be taken

145
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,020
out at this stage.

146
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:59,180
I have set my expectations to mild, but it's so unlikely.

147
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,420
It's like a lock pretty much.

148
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,620
Yeah, and this is huge.

149
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,220
We've been waiting for this for how long?

150
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:10,580
I think 2,000 years because I feel like this has been the software that we have essentially

151
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:15,980
waited the last three or four releases for, and it just wasn't quite there, but part of

152
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:21,420
what's pushed this over the final line, I suspect, is WireGuard's main developer, Jason

153
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:27,020
Donfield, has also been contributing to the AVX crypto optimizations to the kernel, which

154
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,740
is not part of WireGuard itself, but something WireGuard could potentially use.

155
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,500
And I think that's helped get that more performant, which is up to the standards of WireGuard,

156
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,380
and the two have kind of come together at the right time, and it's a kumbaya, and Linus

157
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,820
has always been a big fan of the technology to begin with.

158
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:48,780
And here we are with a simple change line that just says, quote, add WireGuard.

159
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:55,940
But come on, the biggest change coming in 5.6 is a fix for the 2038 bug in 32-bit kernels.

160
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,940
I saw that.

161
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,940
Yeah, yeah.

162
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,780
I don't know about you, but I'm a little disappointed in this one.

163
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,800
I was really looking forward to some Y2K hype again.

164
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,780
Everything that's old is new again, and I'm ready for that.

165
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,100
That was a good time.

166
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,940
Can you believe that that is happening in 18 years?

167
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,300
I mean, I'd like one a little sooner than that.

168
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,720
I'd like another hype cycle.

169
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,780
For me, it was a great time.

170
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,140
I remember we stayed up late.

171
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,180
We waited to see if the world burned down, and then my coworker and I loaded up in our

172
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:27,820
car, and we went to work, and we checked on all the servers to make sure everything was

173
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,820
working.

174
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,500
As a young IT professional, I looked back on it very fondly, and I had no skin in the

175
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,500
game.

176
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Everybody was freaking out.

177
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
I'm like, yeah, whatever happens, happens.

178
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
I got a job.

179
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Fair enough.

180
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,340
It was great.

181
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,340
But USB 4.0 is also going to be in 5.6.

182
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
Yeah.

183
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,540
Boy, talk about getting stuff before it's even needed in the market.

184
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,340
I love when vendors work upstream.

185
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,780
Along with that USB 4.0 support is also a bunch of other drivers and things that make

186
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:02,660
that possible, and finally, time namespace, which was originally proposed back in 2018,

187
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,460
it allows for per namespace offsets to the system clock.

188
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,940
I know, what?

189
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,220
It's crazy.

190
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:17,740
But think of a multi-thousand container system or multi-hundred even container system, and

191
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,180
you want to boot things up in a way where everything's in the right time, everything's

192
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,020
in the right sync, even though there's delays just because of the pure load of that.

193
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:33,060
If you can factor for that and set time offsets in those namespaces, well, then magic can

194
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,060
happen.

195
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,780
I actually don't know what the primary use case would be other than compensating for

196
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,940
boot time, but perhaps that's enough reason to implement this.

197
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,380
I just think it's the coolest feature ever.

198
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,380
Time namespaces, Joe.

199
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,980
Yeah, I knew you'd notice that one with you being all in on containers these days.

200
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,980
Oh, yeah.

201
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,980
Well, I'm just so all in.

202
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,260
You know what it is?

203
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,860
It's just that I'm sort of sick and tired of doing VMs.

204
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,900
Looks like Michael Larable over at Feromics noticed that Ubuntu 2004, even though it will

205
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:08,000
ship an older kernel, will backport WireGuard into Ubuntu 2004, which is important since

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,580
that's a long-term support.

207
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:15,620
Not technically too hard either since WireGuard has been maintaining a tree that goes alongside

208
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,020
the Linux kernel for years now, so the code's there.

209
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,640
It just had to do the work to bring it in and get the userspace tools up in the archive

210
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
and all that.

211
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
It looks like that's happening.

212
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,220
So it looks like 2020 is the year of WireGuard then.

213
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,220
Whoop, whoop.

214
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,940
I don't think I made a prediction about that, which is a massive oversight on my part.

215
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,300
Yeah, but Alex did, so he's got that one over here.

216
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,300
Ah, dang it.

217
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,300
Good for him.

218
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,300
Good for him.

219
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Good.

220
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,300
Fair play.

221
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,300
Fair play, I suppose.

222
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,820
Well, something that I'm not sure many people would have predicted is that Thunderbird is

223
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:52,420
being spun out into its own wholly owned subsidiary, cleverly called the MZLA Technologies Corporation

224
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,660
or MZLA Technologies Corporation.

225
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,660
Yeah, MZLA.

226
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,340
You know, I'm not surprised.

227
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,060
Thunderbird's kind of been on shaky ground from, we're putting her in maintenance mode

228
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,220
to, oh, all right, we'll take donations to, hey, we got some donations I'm going to hire

229
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,060
to now this move.

230
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,020
They write on the blog, this move has been in the works for a while as Thunderbird has

231
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,900
grown in donations, staff, and aspirations.

232
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,860
This will not impact Thunderbird's day-to-day activities or missions.

233
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,740
It will remain free and open source.

234
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,740
So that's good.

235
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:31,540
They go on to write, moving to MZLA, which sounds a lot like Mozilla, but without some

236
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:37,180
of the letters, to MZLA Technologies Corporation will not only allow Thunderbird to have more

237
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:43,060
flexibility and agility, but also allow us to explore offering our users products and

238
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,740
services that were not possible under the Mozilla Foundation.

239
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,900
The move will allow the project to collect revenue through partnerships and non-charitable

240
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,180
donations, which in turn can be used to cover the cost of new products and services.

241
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,100
So we're going to get a VPN client in Thunderbird.

242
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,500
Oh, I hope so.

243
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,220
Yeah.

244
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,340
Let's see, a VPN client, a cloud storage client.

245
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,340
Actually that wouldn't be too bad.

246
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,940
I don't know.

247
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:18,660
It's never going to happen, but I would pay for really well-developed Mozilla extensions,

248
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,340
like a Fantastic Cal quality calendar from Mozilla.

249
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:26,060
Fantastic Cal is an app on the phone, just a really great calendar app.

250
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,340
Something that was like Enigma, but even easier and simpler and more approachable, I'd pay

251
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,060
a couple of bucks for that.

252
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,500
I suspect it's through other partnerships.

253
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,980
I have no idea what that could mean.

254
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,980
Maybe it's bundling.

255
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,980
Who knows?

256
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,340
I guess we'll just wait and see.

257
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,060
Well, this is good news as far as I'm concerned.

258
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:47,100
It's good news in that they're not just leaving it to rot, they're putting it out there as

259
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,340
its own corporation that can work to make its own money.

260
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:56,560
And I set my dad up on Thunderbird years and years ago and he's just been slowly updating

261
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,540
and using it and it's been working fine for him, but I've been kind of keeping an eye

262
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,980
on alternatives in case Thunderbird goes away.

263
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,500
But this kind of gives me confidence that it won't go away and I won't have to migrate

264
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
him.

265
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,500
I really like it too.

266
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,580
I don't use it every single day, but just about every system I have that I do email

267
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,220
on, I got Thunderbird on there doing something.

268
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,840
We can put some of this into context when we look at their last year.

269
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,220
In the last year, they hired six new employees, five engineers and a community manager, which

270
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,980
really came in from what I can tell, primarily funded by donations, which seems to be the

271
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,140
company's primary source of funding.

272
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:38,580
Now that's not going to scale much wider than I would bet it is right now, unless they started

273
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,660
taking on a lot of new users because a very small percentage of them might contribute.

274
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:47,020
So I can see why they need to look for other revenue sources, but boy, is this going to

275
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,700
be one of those things that the community will watch so closely with a lot of skepticism

276
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,300
because email is one of those things people can be very sensitive about.

277
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,380
And if you're in Thunderbird, there's a very, very high chance you're already sensitive

278
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,580
to snooping from things like Gmail and Hotmail and all the other cloud emails that are reading

279
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,580
your emails.

280
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,580
Yeah.

281
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,220
So let's hope that any of these commercial offerings will be optional.

282
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,060
I would imagine they would be.

283
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,480
You know, my read is that they know how to handle this kind of thing, that they know

284
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,860
their audience and they know how to go about it.

285
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,980
So I'm not overly concerned.

286
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,660
Just a little more context.

287
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:29,020
According to the data from Litmus Email Analytics, the Mozilla email client accounted for just

288
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,540
0.5% of all email opened across devices in Q1 of 2019.

289
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:39,460
However, that is up from 0.1% in Q2 of 2018.

290
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,260
So they had a pretty good year in 2019.

291
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:49,440
To put that in perspective, Apple is around 7.8% with their mail client and Outlook is

292
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,620
only around 10%, just really around 9.2%.

293
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:58,620
I'm surprised that's even that high given how popular webmail is these days.

294
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,620
Yeah.

295
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,620
Yeah.

296
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,300
Outlook I thought would be a little higher because back in my corporate days, I literally

297
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,260
saw people that spent their entire day in Outlook.

298
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:14,380
It was on every corporate computer everywhere, although I bet a lot of them are just sending

299
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,540
internally.

300
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,740
And so when you're collecting analytics based on headers, you're only looking at emails

301
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,340
that are sent externally.

302
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,140
So maybe that Outlook figure is a little low, but you're right, it really does demonstrate

303
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,460
the total massive dominance of webmail.

304
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,460
It's crazy.

305
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,580
Well, we have some news from IBM this week that shows quite how important Red Hat is

306
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,460
to them these days.

307
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,940
The current CEO, Ginni Rometty, is stepping down from the 108-year-old company.

308
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,100
She's going to be replaced by IBM's senior vice president of cloud.

309
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:53,700
And the same day, Jim Whitehurst, the CEO of Red Hat, will become president of IBM.

310
00:16:53,700 --> 00:17:00,500
Yeah, and Arvind Krishna, the new CEO, was pretty heavily involved in the Red Hat acquisition.

311
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,820
So to put him in charge and then to have his number one be Jim Whitehurst, to me at least,

312
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,700
says that the acquisition was pretty important to them.

313
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,440
I remember when they acquired Red Hat, there was speculation about sort of an acquisition

314
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,020
from within and having Jim run the company.

315
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,100
And I suspect Red Hat employees are pretty happy with this move.

316
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,060
And it was an unfounded speculation because you have to understand Ginni didn't necessarily

317
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:29,780
oversee like a super successful run of the company.

318
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:37,020
IBM experienced 22 consecutive quarters of sales declines under her leadership.

319
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,140
That is pretty bad.

320
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:44,060
Year over year sales dropped nearly 4% from 2018.

321
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:49,900
And I suspect part of the Red Hat acquisition was an attempt to right that trend, but it

322
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,900
was too late.

323
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:55,500
Yeah, and the stock price hasn't exactly done well under Ginni, but I think she was kind

324
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,220
of there at a big period of change in the whole industry.

325
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:08,220
And to be fair to her, she did oversee that Red Hat acquisition and that hopefully for

326
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,660
IBM will kind of drag them back into relevance and profitability.

327
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,780
Yeah, I completely agree with that.

328
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,720
I mean, maybe she had a certain set of market conditions that were changing and IBM was

329
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,020
geared for one set and a transition needed to happen.

330
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,500
Yeah, and a company of that size doesn't just turn on a sixpence, you know, it takes a long

331
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,980
time to turn that ship around.

332
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,540
And that's kind of what she's done here, isn't it?

333
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:38,740
I wonder how involved Jim Whitehurst will be at Red Hat now, if he still is also running

334
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,860
the show over there, if there's going to be promotions within Red Hat, I have a suspicion

335
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,500
there will be another part of this story once this sort of settles down.

336
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,460
And that'll be, what's the leadership story now at Red Hat?

337
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,820
Yeah, it will be interesting to see that, but we probably won't find out before April,

338
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,340
because that's when Krishna and Whitehurst are actually going to take up these new roles.

339
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,980
Well, I haven't said this for a while, Google has something pretty cool for the open source

340
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,980
community.

341
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,980
It's OpenSK.

342
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,260
Yeah, which is a fully open source security key implementation written in Rust.

343
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,780
So that got you excited, I assume.

344
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,860
Well, of course, and the fact that it supports the FIDO U2F and FIDO2 standards, but this

345
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,460
is like a full stack they have here.

346
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:25,060
The OpenSK research platform, as they put it, it's not only a software part, but they

347
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:31,580
have the hardware bit and they even make available a custom 3D printable case so you can protect

348
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,580
the key.

349
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,420
I love this.

350
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,100
You're right, the fact that it's written in Rust is kind of nice.

351
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:43,380
Rust has strong memory protection, and it makes code generally less vulnerable to logical

352
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,380
attacks.

353
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,500
And they combine that with TalkOS, which has a sandboxed architecture.

354
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,420
That's the little bit that runs on the key, which offers isolation between the security

355
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:58,980
key applet itself, the drivers, the kernel, it's all completely isolated from each other.

356
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,800
It's really kind of neat the way it does it.

357
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,340
And they bring it all together into a complete package.

358
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,740
They have a demo that we'll have linked in the show notes.

359
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,860
And anybody that's thought about like a Yuba key kind of thing before, this is right up

360
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,860
your alley.

361
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,800
Yeah, this isn't kind of a finished product.

362
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,260
This is more aimed at people who want to make a finished product out of it.

363
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,560
Yeah, I mean, I think tinkers would be happy with it too, but you're right.

364
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,080
This is a great starting point.

365
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,740
And I was, funny enough, just before this announcement, I was thinking to myself, maybe

366
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,660
I should get back into this again.

367
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,800
When you have a Yuba key, it was really so nice, especially when you use it for SSH logins

368
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,540
and laptop encryption keys and stuff like that.

369
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,180
It's so great.

370
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:44,100
So something that's an open standard like this that anybody could build, it's pretty

371
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100
good to see.

372
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,100
Pretty good.

373
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,060
And you can actually try this out right now if you've got a Nordic dongle.

374
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,600
You can just flash this on there and get going straight away.

375
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,000
So much going on every single week.

376
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,860

We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

385
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,620
I'm at Chris LAS.

386
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,380
I'm at Charles Rissington.

387
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,380
Thanks for joining us.

388
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,380
