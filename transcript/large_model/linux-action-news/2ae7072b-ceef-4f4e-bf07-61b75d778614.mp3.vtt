00:00.000 --> 00:16.480
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.480 --> 00:21.240
This is episode 109, recorded on June 9th, 2019.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.240
I'm Chris.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.240
And I'm Joe.

00:23.240 --> 00:24.240
Hello, Joe.

00:24.240 --> 00:27.180
It's very good to be connected with you and I'm looking at our first couple of stories

00:27.180 --> 00:32.880
and I'm thinking to myself, there is a couple of big themes developing in 2019.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.260
And our first two stories are really about that.

00:35.260 --> 00:37.080
Let's kick it off with the one about Firefox.

00:37.080 --> 00:42.600
Yeah, this is Mozilla proudly announcing that Firefox now has enhanced tracking protection

00:42.600 --> 00:44.040
by default.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.240
If privacy isn't the buzzword of 2019.

00:46.240 --> 00:47.240
I don't know what it is.

00:47.240 --> 00:50.760
It is like what everybody's talking about from Facebook to Google right now.

00:50.760 --> 00:55.120
But there's a couple of companies I genuinely believe when they talk about privacy and Mozilla

00:55.120 --> 00:56.880
is one of them.

00:56.880 --> 01:01.320
They write on their blog this week, this past year, we've seen tech companies talk a big

01:01.320 --> 01:05.980
game about privacy, as they realized that after several global scandals, people feel

01:05.980 --> 01:07.840
increasingly vulnerable.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.960
They continue, it's unfortunate that this shift had to happen in order for tech companies

01:11.960 --> 01:13.140
to take notice.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.740
At Firefox, we're doing more than that.

01:15.740 --> 01:20.500
We believe that in order to truly protect people, we need to establish a new standard

01:20.500 --> 01:22.400
that puts people's privacy first.

01:22.400 --> 01:27.440
At Firefox, we have been working on setting this standard by offering privacy related

01:27.440 --> 01:33.280
features like tracking protection in private browsing, long before these issues were brought

01:33.280 --> 01:34.520
to light.

01:34.520 --> 01:41.040
Today, Firefox will roll this feature out, as well as enhanced tracking protection to

01:41.040 --> 01:44.200
all new users turned on by default.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.200
This is exactly what Mozilla needs to be doing.

01:46.200 --> 01:50.600
They can't compete with Chrome on features, they've kind of tried to compete on speed

01:50.600 --> 01:55.280
and stuff, but ultimately, everybody knows that Google's business model is based around

01:55.280 --> 02:02.740
advertising and tracking and Firefox being completely open source has that advantage.

02:02.740 --> 02:08.880
They can genuinely compete and I think that if Firefox stands any chance of regaining

02:08.880 --> 02:11.720
some market share, then this is how they're going to do it.

02:11.720 --> 02:15.800
They're in a unique market position here and it's great that they're leveraging this and

02:15.800 --> 02:20.040
they also are talking a little bit about their Facebook container extension, which in my

02:20.040 --> 02:24.160
opinion, if you're going to have a Facebook account, the only way to safely use Facebook

02:24.160 --> 02:29.160
at this point in 2019 is with Firefox and the Facebook container extension.

02:29.160 --> 02:31.160
So I'm a big fan.

02:31.160 --> 02:35.120
They also are talking a little bit in this post about their new monitor service, which

02:35.120 --> 02:37.560
we've covered previously in the show.

02:37.560 --> 02:40.400
You remember that monitoring service lets you check your email address to see if it's

02:40.400 --> 02:42.360
been compromised.

02:42.360 --> 02:47.320
It's in association with the Have I Been Pwned database and they're bringing all these different

02:47.320 --> 02:52.720
services together, privacy tracking, the Facebook container, the monitoring service and they're

02:52.720 --> 02:56.360
saying this is Firefox.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.880
I really like this.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.340
I think this is super important.

03:00.340 --> 03:03.320
At the same time, there's a couple of aspects that concern me.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.720
You know, that's just who I am.

03:04.720 --> 03:11.360
I mean, in total, I am more happy with Firefox than I've ever been and I am happier with

03:11.360 --> 03:16.480
Mozilla than I've ever been in totality, but I do walk away with a couple of concerns nonetheless.

03:16.480 --> 03:21.040
Number one, built-in content blocking is good.

03:21.040 --> 03:25.500
I just am a little concerned about who's in control of the list of who gets blocked.

03:25.500 --> 03:29.880
So we have some resources in our show notes if you're concerned about that as well.

03:29.880 --> 03:31.360
Right now, it passes my sniff test.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.140
I'll just put it that way.

03:33.140 --> 03:37.440
Number two, the other thing that kind of worries me is I think this is a really important battle.

03:37.440 --> 03:39.800
Privacy and protecting tracking online.

03:39.800 --> 03:45.160
I just am concerned it's not enough to stem the tide of people switching to Chrome.

03:45.160 --> 03:49.800
That's an important aspect of Firefox, but I don't think it's enough to prevent those

03:49.800 --> 03:52.120
that are switching to Chrome from switching.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.160
Well, surely it's got to be the other way around.

03:54.160 --> 04:00.440
It's got to be winning people back from Chrome and bringing them back to Firefox.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.520
That surely has to be the goal.

04:02.520 --> 04:07.680
I suppose the way you're looking at it is kind of try and stop the bleeding, whereas

04:07.680 --> 04:11.600
I'm thinking more try and get the patient back to full fitness.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.880
Yeah, I think you're right.

04:13.880 --> 04:15.800
I could see it as an argument to come back.

04:15.800 --> 04:19.080
Oh, you tried this other thing and now you're concerned about it tracking you.

04:19.080 --> 04:21.800
Well, by the way, that's exactly what we've been working on.

04:21.800 --> 04:22.800
Okay.

04:22.800 --> 04:23.800
All right.

04:23.800 --> 04:24.800
I could see that argument.

04:24.800 --> 04:25.800
Is it enough though?

04:25.800 --> 04:26.800
Is that enough?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.080
Well, what else can they do?

04:28.080 --> 04:29.560
I guess take it in full.

04:29.560 --> 04:33.080
If you look at the big picture, which I think is what's important about this story, if you

04:33.080 --> 04:37.720
look at all of 2019, it has been a strong year for Mozilla.

04:37.720 --> 04:42.040
They've had a couple of missteps, but they have had solid Firefox release after Firefox

04:42.040 --> 04:43.040
release.

04:43.040 --> 04:47.640
When it comes to security, privacy, and performance, they have been killing it this year.

04:47.640 --> 04:54.480
They've had a couple of not so awesome moments this year as well, but the core product has

04:54.480 --> 04:55.880
just gotten better and better.

04:55.880 --> 05:00.620
I would argue that Edge switching over to Blink is probably a very bad thing that's

05:00.620 --> 05:07.320
happened for Firefox this year, although that's kind of a double-edged sword because it does

05:07.320 --> 05:13.680
make them stand out now as a project, it offers something different, but realistically, now

05:13.680 --> 05:19.320
Google controls most of the web standards, so I don't know.

05:19.320 --> 05:25.780
Maybe this is all wishful thinking that Firefox can actually regain some market share here.

05:25.780 --> 05:27.440
That is a tough thing to watch.

05:27.440 --> 05:33.480
So many times in our industry, we've seen not necessarily the best tech or the one that

05:33.480 --> 05:38.200
is the most consumer-friendly tech win.

05:38.200 --> 05:42.680
That sort of feels like a narrative that gets played out over and over again.

05:42.680 --> 05:47.920
I look at the web with a bigger kind of picture perspective.

05:47.920 --> 05:54.840
I've been using the internet since Mosaic, and I've watched Netscape become a thing and

05:54.840 --> 05:55.840
die.

05:55.840 --> 05:59.360
I've watched Firefox rise from the ashes of Netscape.

05:59.360 --> 06:04.120
I have watched Internet Explorer become a thing, dominate the web and die, and now I'm

06:04.120 --> 06:05.820
watching Chrome.

06:05.820 --> 06:11.600
To me, it simply just feels like another phase of the web's development.

06:11.600 --> 06:17.200
I look at people that stick with certain technologies long-term, like Firefox, as the long-term

06:17.200 --> 06:19.080
players of the stock market.

06:19.080 --> 06:23.280
People are hedging their bets on Firefox, and there's just a certain demo that's never

06:23.280 --> 06:24.640
going to switch away.

06:24.640 --> 06:29.320
For you existing users, Firefox is going to roll out that enhanced tracking protection

06:29.320 --> 06:32.220
by default in the next coming months.

06:32.220 --> 06:33.500
You don't have to change a thing.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.720
It's not going to happen immediately.

06:35.720 --> 06:39.600
But if you're like me and you're like, I kind of want to turn it on now, you can turn that

06:39.600 --> 06:45.760
feature on by clicking on the little menu hamburger icon in the right of the browser.

06:45.760 --> 06:49.400
If you go to the content blocking section, you'll see it there in the privacy preferences.

06:49.400 --> 06:53.120
If you click on there, you can then go in there and mark cookies and all that kind of

06:53.120 --> 06:58.120
stuff as privacy tracking protected, and you'll have all the features that Mozilla is rolling

06:58.120 --> 07:00.760
out right now for brand new users of Firefox.

07:00.760 --> 07:05.920
They will turn all of that stuff on eventually, but it's not on today by default.

07:05.920 --> 07:12.280
And I say, for those of you that are hedging your bets that are holding on Firefox, just

07:12.280 --> 07:13.480
keep investing.

07:13.480 --> 07:17.840
Because so far, 2019 has been returning dividends like crazy.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.760
It has gotten to be a great browser.

07:19.760 --> 07:24.680
I have gone from it being my secondary browser to now it's once again my primary driver.

07:24.680 --> 07:28.280
And I'm using Chrome as my second browser for all the Google properties.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.120
And I don't think I'm alone in that.

07:31.120 --> 07:34.320
I've heard a lot of feedback from the audience that says Firefox has gotten a lot better

07:34.320 --> 07:35.320
this year.

07:35.320 --> 07:39.080
So what you're saying is much like Bitcoin, with Firefox, you've got a huddle.

07:39.080 --> 07:40.080
You got a hold, dude.

07:40.080 --> 07:44.360
You got a hold.

07:44.360 --> 07:47.200
Or you know, run them all like I do.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.320
I'm just like, I just try them all.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.160
I'm like a three, I just can't get by without three browsers.

07:52.160 --> 07:53.160
I'm a three browser guy.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.160
Hmm.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.160
I've only got two installed at the moment.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.960
I used to have Chromium and Chrome, but I've only got Chrome and Firefox now.

07:58.960 --> 08:02.240
But I only use Chrome for stuff that needs it like Source Connect.

08:02.240 --> 08:07.640
Well, while we're talking about like, big picture topics for 2019, privacy and each

08:07.640 --> 08:11.080
Silicon Valley company trying to come up with their own privacy angle.

08:11.080 --> 08:14.880
That's obviously one of the big picture topics, which is so funny coming from like the open

08:14.880 --> 08:15.880
source Linux camp.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.440
We'll just sit here and be like, hmm, that's cute.

08:18.440 --> 08:19.440
Keep trying Facebook.

08:19.440 --> 08:20.440
Keep trying Google.

08:20.440 --> 08:21.440
That's adorable.

08:21.440 --> 08:26.480
But there's been another huge, huge trend this year that I really wish one of us would

08:26.480 --> 08:27.480
have predicted.

08:27.480 --> 08:33.280
And that is the shift that software as a service is causing in the open source industry.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.160
Yeah, we're seeing it with Redis and MongoDB.

08:36.160 --> 08:40.880
And the latest project to change their license is CockroachDB.

08:40.880 --> 08:45.820
And they are changing to the business source license, which is pretty funny, really.

08:45.820 --> 08:50.600
It's almost an open source license, except you can do all of the normal stuff you can

08:50.600 --> 08:55.040
with open source except for run it as a service.

08:55.040 --> 08:58.080
Yeah, it's the reverse mullet license.

08:58.080 --> 09:02.560
It's business up front, and it's party in the back, right?

09:02.560 --> 09:07.440
So I think it's pretty good just to go right from the post over at cockroachlabs.com, which

09:07.440 --> 09:09.360
we'll have linked in the notes.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.520
CockroachDB was conceived as an open source software.

09:12.520 --> 09:17.040
And they write, in the years since it appeared on GitHub, we've had to tread a relatively

09:17.040 --> 09:22.200
typical path in balancing open source with creating a viable business.

09:22.200 --> 09:26.920
We've kept our code under the Apache version 2 license, the APL.

09:26.920 --> 09:33.080
We've launched a managed service and gated some features for established companies under

09:33.080 --> 09:35.280
what is considered an enterprise license.

09:35.280 --> 09:39.960
But our past outlook on the right business model relied on a crucial norm in the open

09:39.960 --> 09:42.800
source world.

09:42.800 --> 09:48.520
Companies could build a business around a strong open source core product without a

09:48.520 --> 09:56.160
much larger technology platform company coming along and offering the same product as a service.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.120
That norm no longer holds.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.640
It sounds like their business model was wishful thinking when they write it like that.

10:02.640 --> 10:03.640
Yeah.

10:03.640 --> 10:04.640
Exactly.

10:04.640 --> 10:11.040
But one thing about this business source license is that after three years, then that release

10:11.040 --> 10:14.040
branch becomes properly open source.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.640
So right around the time when everyone has moved off onto the next version.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.780
Well, yeah, that's the party in the back that I was talking about.

10:20.780 --> 10:23.480
After three years, it goes back to the Apache license.

10:23.480 --> 10:28.880
So it transitions from components being under the BSL to them being under the APL after

10:28.880 --> 10:29.880
three years.

10:29.880 --> 10:33.700
And I actually just went and did a bit of reading about this to try to get us a nice

10:33.700 --> 10:35.400
concise breakdown.

10:35.400 --> 10:42.980
So in concrete terms, Cockroach DB 19.2, which is currently tentatively scheduled for October

10:42.980 --> 10:47.520
of this year, will be the first release that will use this new licensing scheme.

10:47.520 --> 10:52.480
It will include code under both the BSL and the CCL.

10:52.480 --> 10:59.840
Then in October of 2022, three years after its release, the portions of the Cockroach

10:59.840 --> 11:04.640
DB 19.2 release under the BSL will convert to the APL.

11:04.640 --> 11:06.440
So how about that, Joe?

11:06.440 --> 11:11.840
It's restricted, but only for a limited period of time, and then after three years, you do

11:11.840 --> 11:12.840
with what you want.

11:12.840 --> 11:17.880
I mean, in terms of enterprise, three years really isn't that long.

11:17.880 --> 11:21.400
This isn't super restrictive in enterprise timescales.

11:21.400 --> 11:27.700
Well, that's true, but surely enterprise, when planning a deployment, are not going

11:27.700 --> 11:31.240
to go for something like this when there are open source alternatives, because this is

11:31.240 --> 11:33.280
not open source.

11:33.280 --> 11:37.320
The source code is there, it is available, but would you take a risk on that?

11:37.320 --> 11:41.600
If they've changed it once, then maybe they could change future versions to something

11:41.600 --> 11:43.280
even more restrictive.

11:43.280 --> 11:46.080
For me, I'd just be looking to move away from Cockroach DB.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.080
Hmm.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.080
Yeah, that's a good point.

11:48.080 --> 11:52.660
I guess the only sort of caveat there would be this is how Maria or Mariah DB does it.

11:52.660 --> 11:55.000
They have a BSL license similar to this.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.100
It's not quite the same implementation.

11:57.100 --> 11:59.640
And that's been endorsed by the OSI founder, Bruce Perens.

11:59.640 --> 12:05.080
Yeah, and the only thing that you can't do without buying a license is run it as a service.

12:05.080 --> 12:11.120
But I do worry about those future versions and possibly them becoming more restrictive

12:11.120 --> 12:12.120
with it.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.800
So, no, I'm just, I'm not convinced.

12:14.800 --> 12:23.120
Yeah, we're really witnessing a significant licensing transformation in 2019 that, looking

12:23.120 --> 12:26.660
back at it, was obviously inevitable.

12:26.660 --> 12:33.920
When you look at the success of the cloud, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, of course they were

12:33.920 --> 12:37.800
going to take some of this open source code and then reimplement it as a service and charge

12:37.800 --> 12:38.800
a monthly fee.

12:38.800 --> 12:42.000
Like, you would be almost foolish not to.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.140
This was clearly coming.

12:43.140 --> 12:45.520
This reckoning was obvious.

12:45.520 --> 12:49.360
And you've seen some, you've seen just as this year has gone on, you've just seen this

12:49.360 --> 12:50.580
build and build.

12:50.580 --> 12:53.400
And now we're at the point where people have to take heart breaks.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.880
They have to just make a huge change.

12:55.880 --> 12:59.680
And it's, I don't know, it's just like it's happening in front of everybody.

12:59.680 --> 13:00.680
It's so public.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.040
It's really interesting to watch.

13:02.040 --> 13:05.240
Well, the whole cloud market's been very interesting to watch.

13:05.240 --> 13:10.480
And something that I didn't see coming at all was Microsoft and Oracle working together

13:10.480 --> 13:13.440
to link up Azure and Oracle Cloud.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.720
Literally link them up.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.300
Like a physical connection between the clouds.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.300
Isn't that fascinating?

13:18.300 --> 13:19.300
This is actually pretty deep.

13:19.300 --> 13:23.520
Microsoft and Oracle announced a new alliance that will see the two companies directly connect

13:23.520 --> 13:29.440
their data centers with a direct network connection so that users can move workloads between the

13:29.440 --> 13:30.440
two clouds.

13:30.440 --> 13:36.000
The other thing I didn't really see coming was the huge response to this story.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.080
Like even in our own community, like a lot of people are talking about this.

13:40.080 --> 13:46.280
I find this entire thing fascinating because it's sort of like the B and C players of the

13:46.280 --> 13:50.960
cloud coming together to form an alliance that goes beyond just like basic integration

13:50.960 --> 13:54.560
and to a whole new level of data center connectivity.

13:54.560 --> 14:00.280
And for Oracle, the alliance means that its users can run services like Oracle eBusiness

14:00.280 --> 14:08.400
Suite or the Oracle JD Edwards on the Azure services while still using Oracle databases

14:08.400 --> 14:12.080
in the Oracle cloud that they've been paying for now for probably a couple of years.

14:12.080 --> 14:17.600
And Microsoft gets in on the action of running some Oracle workloads on their servers while

14:17.600 --> 14:25.560
still being able to utilize legit, genuine Oracle hosted Oracle database software.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.000
You know, not something that probably appeals to you and I.

14:28.000 --> 14:34.520
Like I personally avoided Oracle like the plague, not out of any kind of disrespect

14:34.520 --> 14:38.680
to Oracle or the people that work on it, but just never an area I wanted to go into.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.380
I felt like that was a rabbit hole I would never get out of.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.640
But I could really see like if I'm trying to move this crap up to the cloud and then

14:44.640 --> 14:49.480
these two guys get working together and the other thing that makes us kind of nice is

14:49.480 --> 14:51.600
they will also share identity.

14:51.600 --> 14:56.920
So if you are authenticated, say in the Oracle cloud, those authentication credentials will

14:56.920 --> 15:00.900
carry over to the Azure cloud and vice versa.

15:00.900 --> 15:01.900
That's neat.

15:01.900 --> 15:05.200
And it's probably some sort of like hosted active directory underneath it all.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.140
This is quite limited to start with, though.

15:08.140 --> 15:15.680
It's only Azure US East and Oracle's Ashburn data centers, but the plan is to expand this.

15:15.680 --> 15:20.140
I was thinking about Microsoft's motivations for this and one of our research team dug

15:20.140 --> 15:30.960
up some very interesting numbers from canalysis from February 2019 showing that in 2018, AWS

15:30.960 --> 15:34.720
had about 32% market share.

15:34.720 --> 15:37.680
Azure had about half of that roughly.

15:37.680 --> 15:45.000
What's really interesting is the growth and how AWS has been growing at about 47% versus

15:45.000 --> 15:48.240
Azure growing at 82%.

15:48.240 --> 15:54.280
And so although AWS is the massive market leader, Microsoft is starting to gain on them

15:54.280 --> 15:58.640
and Google as well have gotten huge growth of nearly 94%.

15:58.640 --> 16:06.360
So it is a very dynamic market and I always think of it as AWS and the rest, but it seems

16:06.360 --> 16:09.040
that that is shifting.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.040
You know, I can't argue that.

16:11.040 --> 16:17.120
I think it has been AWS and the rest, and I think it is shifting and that's interesting.

16:17.120 --> 16:21.720
And the reason why I feel that way is I've just recently attended Linux Fest Northwest

16:21.720 --> 16:27.540
Scale Red Hat Summit and now Texas Linux Fest as well as a couple of other intermediary

16:27.540 --> 16:36.600
meetups and conferences and there is undoubtedly a common consistent theme in all of these

16:36.600 --> 16:37.600
events.

16:37.600 --> 16:41.700
Jeez, I feel like I'm coming to confessional right now because you have to understand my

16:41.700 --> 16:47.360
background has been in traditional IT where I have set up infrastructures for companies

16:47.360 --> 16:52.680
and I've built like super awesome setups with like local storage and virtualization.

16:52.680 --> 16:59.360
So for me, like it feels like a loss to be moving away from that, but it is just no question

16:59.360 --> 17:00.360
about it, Joe.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.980
No, I mean, just zero.

17:02.980 --> 17:06.520
And then when you expand out to all of the other events our whole team has gone to this

17:06.520 --> 17:10.480
year, the common theme is moving workloads to the cloud.

17:10.480 --> 17:14.240
And I mean, that's only simply validated by how much IBM was willing to pay for Red Hat

17:14.240 --> 17:19.000
because they believe that a lot of shops with traditional workloads are going to move to

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
the cloud.

17:20.000 --> 17:24.880
And in that world, it's just getting started.

17:24.880 --> 17:33.760
And Microsoft has a huge, huge, huge on-premises advantage with Active Directory and SQL and

17:33.760 --> 17:36.880
SharePoint and Exchange.

17:36.880 --> 17:43.520
Just those products alone are industry defining and if they can get people that are hooked

17:43.520 --> 17:49.960
into those ecosystems to transition to Azure, I mean, they're going to give AWS a run for

17:49.960 --> 17:54.800
its money because for everybody that's signing up for some cloud service, there are small

17:54.800 --> 18:00.320
businesses and medium businesses and enterprises all over the world that are running their

18:00.320 --> 18:04.760
own infrastructure that one day are going to move to the cloud.

18:04.760 --> 18:10.400
And so, so, so many of them are using these franchise of products and for Microsoft to

18:10.400 --> 18:15.120
be getting their crap together right now is perfect timing.

18:15.120 --> 18:20.480
Like, they're not behind the ball here at all, it's just getting started.

18:20.480 --> 18:23.880
The party is just, just getting started.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.320
And IBM knows it too, that's why they're willing to spend so much on Red Hat because there's

18:27.320 --> 18:33.760
still time to carve out a nice, healthy part of the market as the rest of, or what Ginny

18:33.760 --> 18:39.060
at IBM calls the CEO of IBM, which she says is the next 80%, like the hardest stuff.

18:39.060 --> 18:42.800
The stuff that everybody avoided moving to the cloud is now what they're working on moving

18:42.800 --> 18:43.800
over.

18:43.800 --> 18:50.000
And it kind of makes me sad a little bit because that means some of my past clients are moving

18:50.000 --> 18:54.920
some of the really, really, really cool infrastructure I built for them over to the cloud and they're

18:54.920 --> 18:55.920
no longer going to need it.

18:55.920 --> 18:56.920
They're going to retire that stuff.

18:56.920 --> 18:58.640
And I built it to last forever.

18:58.640 --> 19:00.080
I'm really proud of it.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.640
But that's just what it is, dude.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.640
Yeah.

19:02.640 --> 19:06.960
If you listen very, very carefully, you can hear a million sys admins quietly crying themselves

19:06.960 --> 19:07.960
to sleep.

19:07.960 --> 19:13.180
We didn't have like a meetup, like we would just get together and like just sort of have

19:13.180 --> 19:18.040
like a, I don't know, like a moment where we pour one out.

19:18.040 --> 19:23.280
Well, we mentioned Google Cloud, but at the other end of their business is Android.

19:23.280 --> 19:29.360
And we talked about them being forced to cut Huawei off, but Google seems to be trying

19:29.360 --> 19:35.040
to fight back against this by trying to claim that it's a national security risk.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.000
But I'm somewhat skeptical, I must say.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
Are you?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Oh, interesting.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Okay.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.160
Well, I'm going to say I actually follow Google's logic here.

19:43.160 --> 19:50.560
So, Google has been arguing that by stopping Google from dealing with Huawei, the US is

19:50.560 --> 19:55.080
risking creating two kinds of Android operating systems in the wild.

19:55.080 --> 20:00.600
The genuine version that Google maintains and then some random hybrid version that Huawei

20:00.600 --> 20:02.160
is containing or maintaining.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.160
Right.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.600
And I completely agree up to that point.

20:04.600 --> 20:05.600
Yeah.

20:05.600 --> 20:06.600
That is obvious.

20:06.600 --> 20:07.600
Yeah.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.600
Okay.

20:08.600 --> 20:09.600
But don't you think that does seem like right there bad?

20:09.600 --> 20:14.280
I mean, the hybrid one is likely to have bugs or security issues that Google would be on

20:14.280 --> 20:15.280
top of.

20:15.280 --> 20:18.640
They have teams of people at Google that are fixing that stuff.

20:18.640 --> 20:24.400
And there's no guarantee that Huawei or any other OEM would be on top of fixing that stuff.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.360
And you could be putting even more users at risk then.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.800
I can see the argument here.

20:28.800 --> 20:32.680
I can see the argument and I can see why you would lead with that and not the underlying

20:32.680 --> 20:33.960
motivation.

20:33.960 --> 20:34.960
Call me cynical.

20:34.960 --> 20:40.200
But we talked about the cloud market, there's 80% left to expand into.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.360
Not so much with mobile.

20:42.360 --> 20:46.440
The smartphone market in the West is basically saturated at this point.

20:46.440 --> 20:49.560
And we see the likes of Apple having to move into services.

20:49.560 --> 20:55.200
However, in countries where Huawei are selling their devices, there is still potentially

20:55.200 --> 20:58.280
huge growth to be had.

20:58.280 --> 21:03.680
And if that is happening with a version of Android that doesn't have all the Google play

21:03.680 --> 21:06.440
stuff in it, then Google loses out.

21:06.440 --> 21:11.440
That's why they built Android to put the Google play services and their whole business model

21:11.440 --> 21:12.440
of tracking and advertising.

21:12.440 --> 21:14.360
Well, see, I disagree.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.360
I think they, well, they purchased Android.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.640
And I think initially they thought, this is going to be great.

21:20.640 --> 21:27.460
We'll have a competitor to Apple just based on just massive open source evolution.

21:27.460 --> 21:32.120
And then they realized to be competitive and to be dynamic in the mobile market, you need

21:32.120 --> 21:36.400
to actually have some control over the hardware OEMs because they're going to do crap to ship

21:36.400 --> 21:42.240
actual updates and security patches for their end users, unless you hit them over the head

21:42.240 --> 21:46.360
with policies and rules and restrictions and contracts.

21:46.360 --> 21:49.160
And then you combine in the patent wars and whatnot.

21:49.160 --> 21:56.040
And I just don't see a reality where a company like Huawei or Purism or anybody else could

21:56.040 --> 22:01.240
really truly maintain a mobile operating system at the scale that Google can.

22:01.240 --> 22:05.320
Even when it's Google's own operating system, they'll always be playing catch up.

22:05.320 --> 22:09.600
And I think I don't really need to cite much more than just the history of Android to just

22:09.600 --> 22:11.080
say that this has been played out.

22:11.080 --> 22:16.520
This is like when you look at the Android marketplace now, the most up to date, secure,

22:16.520 --> 22:18.920
feature rich phones are the Pixel phones.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.480
Yeah, you're right.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.880
But that doesn't mean the other thing isn't true as well.

22:22.880 --> 22:25.040
This is not a binary situation.

22:25.040 --> 22:28.080
Their motivations can be twofold here, I think.

22:28.080 --> 22:32.080
This also kind of implies that Huawei was going to fork Android, where when they made

22:32.080 --> 22:36.120
their statement, Huawei had said publicly that they had been working on getting their

22:36.120 --> 22:40.260
own operating system ready, just in case they got caught off from Android.

22:40.260 --> 22:45.320
And they said that they felt like it was ready for customers as soon as this year, and that

22:45.320 --> 22:49.400
they could even be ready for the US and the rest of the world by 2020.

22:49.400 --> 22:53.580
I didn't even really think about it much, but it must be a fork of Android.

22:53.580 --> 22:55.120
And Google's kind of outing that here.

22:55.120 --> 22:59.400
Well, yeah, it must be at least the ROM based on AOSP, which I suppose you could call a

22:59.400 --> 23:01.120
fork here.

23:01.120 --> 23:04.080
And maybe Google knows a bit more than we do on this.

23:04.080 --> 23:08.160
But you're a daily lineage user, so you're essentially living the lifestyle.

23:08.160 --> 23:09.160
Yeah.

23:09.160 --> 23:13.480
And you know, but I've manually flashed Google apps on there, where most people wouldn't

23:13.480 --> 23:14.480
do that.

23:14.480 --> 23:18.120
Do you feel confident that lineage stays on top of all of the security issues?

23:18.120 --> 23:19.120
Yeah.

23:19.120 --> 23:21.280
Would you feel confident that Huawei would or Motorola?

23:21.280 --> 23:26.560
I guess Motorola's a bad example, but if it was an independent Android manufacturer,

23:26.560 --> 23:28.280
would you have that same level of confidence?

23:28.280 --> 23:31.640
Or do you trust lineage because it's an open source community?

23:31.640 --> 23:37.800
I do trust lineage more, and the updates come faster, but with that comes a slight lack

23:37.800 --> 23:38.800
of stability.

23:38.800 --> 23:44.200
But I mean, I don't see why Huawei couldn't do it if they wanted to put the resources

23:44.200 --> 23:45.200
in.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.380
I mean, it's just developer hours, basically.

23:47.380 --> 23:49.760
If they spend the money, then they can do it.

23:49.760 --> 23:53.160
I think they might be able to convince me if they were starting with something like

23:53.160 --> 23:58.200
lineage, but if it's from scratch, in-house, I'm going to be pretty skeptical.

23:58.200 --> 24:02.940
Even if it's an in-house remix of Android, pretty skeptical.

24:02.940 --> 24:08.400
Maybe lineage, I just, I actually, I think Google's argument here is sound.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.120
I think with Huawei, it's an unknown.

24:11.120 --> 24:15.160
They may be able to maintain their own OS and keep it up to date and keep users secure

24:15.160 --> 24:17.320
and relatively patched.

24:17.320 --> 24:19.120
That's a maybe.

24:19.120 --> 24:23.560
But it's a pretty well established, known with Google, that if you sign up with Google

24:23.560 --> 24:26.440
and you play ball, you will get access to these updates.

24:26.440 --> 24:28.760
You can get these as fast as you can roll them out.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.840
And that is, today, a known quantity.

24:31.840 --> 24:33.820
It's a known guaranteed.

24:33.820 --> 24:38.600
And it does make the US more vulnerable if a whole bunch of devices are running a version

24:38.600 --> 24:42.560
of Android that is not kept up to date or as secure.

24:42.560 --> 24:47.280
It's a maybe, but Google's argument in terms of like, you know for, it's just, it's guaranteed.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.040
Like as far as Android gets.

24:50.040 --> 24:51.760
Not being a huge Android fan myself.

24:51.760 --> 24:52.760
Yeah, I suppose so.

24:52.760 --> 24:55.760
I've got a trivia question for you though.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.040
Oh, all right.

24:57.040 --> 25:00.680
Android initially was not made for phones.

25:00.680 --> 25:01.680
What was it made for?

25:01.680 --> 25:02.680
Hmm.

25:02.680 --> 25:03.680
Oh, gosh.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.840
I think I probably knew this at one point.

25:05.840 --> 25:10.440
I'm thinking it was designed with a pointing device in mind and for Java devices.

25:10.440 --> 25:16.020
But I can't really use that to kind of get to what it must have been designed for.

25:16.020 --> 25:18.520
Maybe like a PC-type device?

25:18.520 --> 25:19.520
What?

25:19.520 --> 25:20.520
All right.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.520
I'm going to give you multiple choice then.

25:21.520 --> 25:26.760
Do you think it was ATM software, cameras, or point-of-sale systems?

25:26.760 --> 25:27.760
Hmm.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.760
Hmm.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.840
I'm going to say point-of-sale systems because the cursor.

25:30.840 --> 25:34.400
Like ATMs don't need a cursor, but a point-of-sale system like might.

25:34.400 --> 25:36.400
No, it was cameras.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.880
Oh, really?

25:37.880 --> 25:38.880
Yeah.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.400
Originally developed for cameras.

25:40.400 --> 25:41.400
Yeah.

25:41.400 --> 25:42.400
And then pivoted to phones.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.400
How did I not know that?

25:43.400 --> 25:47.360
You know, how did I not know that before I had to look it up recently for the live show

25:47.360 --> 25:48.360
we did at the weekend?

25:48.360 --> 25:51.520
I actually would have thought it wasn't for cameras just because of the whole pointer

25:51.520 --> 25:54.560
device thing and the whole history of Java applications.

25:54.560 --> 25:59.720
But my knowledge and real like tracking of Android didn't start until Google purchased

25:59.720 --> 26:00.720
Android.

26:00.720 --> 26:01.720
Yeah.

26:01.720 --> 26:02.720
I think a lot of people are in that situation.

26:02.720 --> 26:03.720
Yeah.

26:03.720 --> 26:07.560
Speaking of Google though, I think they sucked me in on this next one.

26:07.560 --> 26:08.560
Really?

26:08.560 --> 26:09.560
Yeah.

26:09.560 --> 26:12.720
So they announced some details for Stadia and you're actually going to buy into it.

26:12.720 --> 26:13.720
Yeah.

26:13.720 --> 26:16.160
And it's red flagging all over the place.

26:16.160 --> 26:20.200
This service is like, as you learn more about it, it becomes less and less appealing and

26:20.200 --> 26:21.520
that's never a good sign.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.080
You know what I mean?

26:23.080 --> 26:24.080
Yeah.

26:24.080 --> 26:26.080
This is their cloud gaming service, of course.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.080
Yeah.

26:27.080 --> 26:32.840
And they announced some pricing, which if you want to get in straight away in November,

26:32.840 --> 26:37.080
then you have to buy the founder's edition, which is like 130 bucks.

26:37.080 --> 26:38.080
Yeah.

26:38.080 --> 26:39.080
Up front.

26:39.080 --> 26:42.200
And then it'll be 9.99 after three months.

26:42.200 --> 26:48.520
And if you want to get early access, like in 2019, the only way to get early access

26:48.520 --> 26:50.960
is through this package.

26:50.960 --> 26:55.240
It's available for pre-order right now on the Google store for like Joe said, about

26:55.240 --> 26:56.240
130 bucks.

26:56.240 --> 26:59.680
And you'll get a controller, which is a limited edition.

26:59.680 --> 27:05.280
You get a Chromecast Ultra, which is a Chromecast that supports 4K and 60 frames a second.

27:05.280 --> 27:09.720
And then you'll get three months of Stadia pro service as well as a buddy pass.

27:09.720 --> 27:12.720
So maybe I'll give you a buddy pass, Joe.

27:12.720 --> 27:16.840
And you get first dibs on your Stadia name too, which is it's interesting that they're

27:16.840 --> 27:21.040
putting that in there as a selling aspect.

27:21.040 --> 27:25.820
So yeah, in 2019, users will be unable to sign up for this pros level service where

27:25.820 --> 27:31.960
you get 4K and 60 frames a second without being in the founder's edition hardware package.

27:31.960 --> 27:38.680
And I decided to pull the trigger and purchase it because I think it's going to actually

27:38.680 --> 27:42.920
help me use a full open source stack on my desktop.

27:42.920 --> 27:46.160
And that was sort of my deciding factor recently.

27:46.160 --> 27:47.680
I'll tell you why here in a second.

27:47.680 --> 27:51.360
But just a couple of things that I thought I'd pass along is Google has changed a couple

27:51.360 --> 27:54.680
of the bits of details about their Stadia game streaming service as well.

27:54.680 --> 27:58.980
They're now recommending that you have at least 10 megabits, which is up slightly for

27:58.980 --> 28:01.600
Stadia to work properly.

28:01.600 --> 28:04.600
You'll get at least 720p and 60 frames per second.

28:04.600 --> 28:10.660
Pro users, the plan that I just signed up for, will want 35 megabits per second.

28:10.660 --> 28:14.440
And streaming quality is going to sort of scale depending on how good that is.

28:14.440 --> 28:19.340
You'll be able to use any desktop, laptop, or even a tablet that can run the desktop

28:19.340 --> 28:23.880
version of Chrome or Chromebook that can run the desktop version of Chrome.

28:23.880 --> 28:28.320
And then they'll have mobile support for the Pixel 3 and 3a at launch.

28:28.320 --> 28:32.840
And Google says they will expand to other phones over time.

28:32.840 --> 28:40.000
But the part in there that got me was any Chrome desktop browser.

28:40.000 --> 28:42.960
I've been doing something recently, you know, because I've talked to you about it off air

28:42.960 --> 28:44.520
and I've talked a little bit about it on air.

28:44.520 --> 28:49.000
But for the last few weeks, I've just been having a blast messing around finally after

28:49.000 --> 28:53.520
all these years with PCIe pass-through and KVM.

28:53.520 --> 28:58.880
And I've got a virtualized Windows 10 desktop right now where I'm passing through a Thunderbolt

28:58.880 --> 29:04.280
3 docking station that has an NVIDIA GPU and some Ethernet and some USB and some DisplayPort

29:04.280 --> 29:05.280
built into it.

29:05.280 --> 29:09.840
So the whole dock, the entire dock is dedicated to my VM.

29:09.840 --> 29:15.160
And so I can plug in one PCI, or I'm sorry, Thunderbolt 3 cable, which is essentially

29:15.160 --> 29:20.600
PCI Express, into my ThinkPad and it's just dedicated to the VM.

29:20.600 --> 29:25.320
And the brilliant thing about it is I don't have to have any crappy proprietary drivers

29:25.320 --> 29:26.980
on the host system.

29:26.980 --> 29:32.200
So my laptop is running Fedora with all open source software.

29:32.200 --> 29:37.920
The graphics stack, everything is open source and just is super solid and reliable.

29:37.920 --> 29:43.420
And all the proprietary driver crap for the NVIDIA card and all that stuff is all isolated

29:43.420 --> 29:45.460
in the VM.

29:45.460 --> 29:47.120
Doesn't mess up my host system at all.

29:47.120 --> 29:52.720
So I have brilliant stability with a great XFCE desktop on the ThinkPad T480 and then

29:52.720 --> 29:58.080
I can abuse the crap out of this Windows 10 VM, which has a dedicated monitor, keyboard

29:58.080 --> 30:04.360
and mouse, dedicated Ethernet, all of it, and the drivers installed and have at it.

30:04.360 --> 30:09.040
But this, this would let me get rid of the VM.

30:09.040 --> 30:13.480
Then I could still have a totally open source driver stack on my desktop and still play

30:13.480 --> 30:15.120
the video games.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.960
It's one level even better for me.

30:17.960 --> 30:21.120
And I know a lot of people are skeptical about game streaming.

30:21.120 --> 30:26.680
I was too, having messed around with OnLive when that was a thing and GeForce Now on my

30:26.680 --> 30:31.180
Shield, I've actually had a great time streaming games.

30:31.180 --> 30:35.400
For me, it's been a good experience so far and I'm willing to give this a go.

30:35.400 --> 30:41.760
If I can run 100% open source software on my desktop and the only trade is a $9 a month

30:41.760 --> 30:46.560
subscription to Google to be able to stream video games where I want to play them, that's

30:46.560 --> 30:47.560
a good value.

30:47.560 --> 30:52.520
So I decided to buy the founder's package so I could get in there and test it and let

30:52.520 --> 30:55.000
the audience know if this is really a thing.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.680
And then they know when it comes out for free or if they want to get the $9 a month or whatever,

30:58.680 --> 30:59.800
they know if it's worth it or not.

30:59.800 --> 31:03.920
You said completely open source software, a bit of an asterisk, you do need Chrome.

31:03.920 --> 31:09.040
Not only Chrome, Joe, but I bet you also need some decoding of the HD64 video stream.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.840
So there are compromises in there, you're right.

31:11.840 --> 31:16.320
So what do you make of this phased rollout, which is essentially what they're doing here,

31:16.320 --> 31:21.560
by making it $130 up front, it means that you're not going to have anywhere near the

31:21.560 --> 31:26.600
number of people where if it was just $10 a month, that to me says that, well, it says

31:26.600 --> 31:27.600
two things.

31:27.600 --> 31:34.100
It says, one, they want to be careful with this and want to see how it goes and how much

31:34.100 --> 31:37.980
resources are actually required to do this.

31:37.980 --> 31:41.280
But it also says to me that maybe they're not confident in the infrastructure that they've

31:41.280 --> 31:42.280
got.

31:42.280 --> 31:43.280
Yeah.

31:43.280 --> 31:44.280
That's what I read too.

31:44.280 --> 31:52.600
You also have a bit of a selection bias because not everybody can afford $130 and you are

31:52.600 --> 31:54.900
guaranteeing a couple of aspects.

31:54.900 --> 31:57.440
You're guaranteeing they're going to have a certain controller and that they're going

31:57.440 --> 32:06.180
to be on a Chromecast Ultra, which will narrow the fragmentation and sort of make the initial

32:06.180 --> 32:09.040
rollout probably a little smoother, I would imagine.

32:09.040 --> 32:13.760
So I think Google is mitigating their risks by gating it like this.

32:13.760 --> 32:19.320
And they claim that after a certain period of time in 2020, they're going to announce

32:19.320 --> 32:24.280
a free tier that doesn't require any monthly subscription at all, but you'll just have

32:24.280 --> 32:25.280
to pay for the games.

32:25.280 --> 32:31.560
What I'm really hoping is for a lot more detail on the backend Linux side of things and the

32:31.560 --> 32:36.280
technologies that they're working on and seeing them upstream stuff, because that's the big

32:36.280 --> 32:40.520
hope here that we'll all benefit from this.

32:40.520 --> 32:46.200
We did get a little more details on this round, Stadia games run on a custom Linux based server

32:46.200 --> 32:49.240
hardware that is maintained by Google.

32:49.240 --> 32:53.160
It promises 10.7 teraflops of power.

32:53.160 --> 32:59.600
In each instance, game audio and video will be streamed to those servers, then to a user's

32:59.600 --> 33:04.240
device from there and inputs are streamed from the user's device to the server over

33:04.240 --> 33:11.640
a network of what Google says are 7,500 edge nodes around the world to reduce latency.

33:11.640 --> 33:13.120
I'm going to give it a go.

33:13.120 --> 33:19.640
My $130 controller and Chromecast Ultra, both of which I don't want, I'd much rather just

33:19.640 --> 33:25.800
use like a Xbox or PS4 controller and my Chrome browser on my desktop.

33:25.800 --> 33:29.760
But when I do get it in November, I'll let you know what I think and I'll probably do

33:29.760 --> 33:30.760
a review on Linux Unplugged.

33:30.760 --> 33:34.400
I wonder if they're going to be like your typical crowd funder and then just keep pushing

33:34.400 --> 33:38.160
it back and back and back or whether they'll actually deliver on this November deadline.

33:38.160 --> 33:41.760
I think they're going to deliver because they're making deals with game publishers, you know,

33:41.760 --> 33:46.160
so they're going to have some commitments in paper that they have to deliver on.

33:46.160 --> 33:49.000
Either way, I suppose we'll be monitoring.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.480
With that and anything that happens in the general open source or Linux world, go to
