00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News.

00:04.720 --> 00:08.680
Episode 213, recorded on October 31st, 2021.

00:08.680 --> 00:09.680
I'm Chris.

00:09.680 --> 00:10.680
And I'm Wes.

00:10.680 --> 00:11.680
Hello, Wes.

00:11.680 --> 00:12.680
Let's do the news.

00:12.680 --> 00:17.160
We start this week with some cheap hardware, well, if you can manage to get your hands

00:17.160 --> 00:18.160
on it.

00:18.160 --> 00:23.840
It's been nearly six years now since the Raspberry Pi Zero was first announced, and

00:23.840 --> 00:29.920
combined, the Zero and its wireless-enabled big brother, the Zero W, have sold almost 4

00:29.920 --> 00:31.640
million units.

00:31.640 --> 00:37.000
And this week, the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W was announced.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
Priced at just $15, the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W uses the same SoC as the launch version

00:44.000 --> 00:50.520
of the Pi 3, but it has its ARM cores slightly clocked down to 1 GHz to reduce thermal load,

00:50.520 --> 00:54.720
alongside 512MB of LPDDR2 SDRAM.

00:54.720 --> 01:00.920
The Zero 2W is equipped with a mini HDMI port, microSD card slot, hardware encode and decode

01:00.920 --> 01:06.360
of H.264, and nice to see this, a hack-compatible 40-pin I.O. header.

01:06.360 --> 01:10.280
But what might be the most impressive thing here, and really great for those of you who've

01:10.280 --> 01:15.480
already invested in a previous Pi Zero, Simon Martin, who designed both that original Zero

01:15.480 --> 01:21.960
and Zero 2W, has been able to squeeze all this extra performance into the original Zero

01:21.960 --> 01:22.960
form factor.

01:22.960 --> 01:28.200
So that means almost all cases and accessories designed for Zero should work just fine with

01:28.200 --> 01:29.200
this new board.

01:29.200 --> 01:33.800
People are loving that online, and this makes me think there's two things about this.

01:33.800 --> 01:38.760
One of them is thermal, but before I get to that, I also want to note that this also brings

01:38.760 --> 01:41.320
the entire lineup to 64-bit now.

01:41.320 --> 01:45.120
That's maybe a small step for one product, but it's a giant leap for Pi kind.

01:45.120 --> 01:51.160
And this Pi 2Zero shows us that they are really working on their thermal game.

01:51.160 --> 01:55.720
Thermals are always a challenge when you're trying to package more performance into the

01:55.720 --> 01:57.880
same small package you had before.

01:57.880 --> 01:58.940
It's an age-old problem.

01:58.940 --> 02:02.280
You want to up the performance, but you want to cram it into the same space.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.960
So how do you dissipate that heat?

02:03.960 --> 02:09.200
Well, similar to what we've seen in other recent Pi products, like my Pi 400, the Zero

02:09.200 --> 02:14.840
2W doubles down on some of their lessons learned recently and uses thick internal copper layers

02:14.840 --> 02:17.200
to conduct heat away from the processor.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.760
Yeah, they mean business.

02:18.760 --> 02:22.320
Apparently, if you hold them both in your hands, you can actually feel that difference

02:22.320 --> 02:23.320
in weight.

02:23.320 --> 02:28.720
Now, sadly, actually getting your hands on one is going to be a challenge for a while.

02:28.720 --> 02:33.680
Zero 2W is not immune to the current global semiconductor shortage, so as a result, they

02:33.680 --> 02:40.720
expect to ship roughly 200,000 units this calendar year and a further 250,000 to follow

02:40.720 --> 02:43.540
in the first half of 2022.

02:43.540 --> 02:58.200
But they do say, quote, we aim to keep Zero 2W in production until at least January 2028.

02:58.200 --> 03:02.960
In news that I just quite never get used to saying, Microsoft's Edge browser on Linux

03:02.960 --> 03:06.000
has finally reached official stable status.

03:06.000 --> 03:11.320
As reported by Sophos, and now covered in several other outlets as we record, a stable

03:11.320 --> 03:19.240
version of Microsoft Edge for Linux is now available in the official Microsoft Edge Linux

03:19.240 --> 03:20.240
repositories.

03:20.240 --> 03:25.840
Now, it is version 95, just like the latest stable release on Windows.

03:25.840 --> 03:30.960
There's been no official announcement by Microsoft as we record this.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.800
It's possible this news cycle just got ahead of them, maybe hit the repo and people started

03:34.800 --> 03:38.660
reporting about it, or it's possible they just don't intend to make a very big deal

03:38.660 --> 03:39.660
out of it.

03:39.660 --> 03:44.280
But if you've been using the development builds of Edge, it should just auto update with the

03:44.280 --> 03:48.360
rest of your system when you do an update again with the repo you already have set up

03:48.360 --> 03:49.360
in most cases.

03:49.360 --> 03:54.240
And you can actually visually tell when Edge has been updated, because that little beta

03:54.240 --> 03:57.800
badge on the icon will finally go away.

03:57.800 --> 04:02.120
Now if I recall, Chris, you started trying out Edge right after it was released.

04:02.120 --> 04:03.120
I did too.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.280
Did you manage to stick with it though?

04:05.280 --> 04:06.280
Not at first.

04:06.280 --> 04:11.120
It was definitely an on and off thing, but as Chrome or Firefox would give me a fit about

04:11.120 --> 04:13.000
something I was trying to do.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.440
For example, this typically would happen was, as you know, we'd be using some WebRTC VoIP

04:17.440 --> 04:23.560
app to do a show and Chrome would be spinning up my CPU and causing my fans to go crazy

04:23.560 --> 04:28.320
and Firefox would have some issue with the screen sharing or some weird Google policy

04:28.320 --> 04:30.000
had been applied to my Chrome browser.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.120
And so just different things would come up and I would try Edge.

04:32.120 --> 04:35.120
Yeah, you need a spare browser sometimes.

04:35.120 --> 04:39.400
And I would find that Edge handled those workloads better.

04:39.400 --> 04:45.280
And so over time, Edge has kind of picked up more and more things I use it for because

04:45.280 --> 04:50.440
in my use, I've just found that it seems to use fewer resources doing the same job.

04:50.440 --> 04:54.600
And it has that Chrome compatibility that I need in some of those WebRTC apps.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.080
So that's kind of been a winner for me.

04:56.080 --> 05:00.280
Plus, I have issues with Chrome where it's constantly nagging me to sign into a profile

05:00.280 --> 05:04.280
when I log into a Gmail inbox for like one of the shows and I just don't get that garbage

05:04.280 --> 05:05.400
with Edge.

05:05.400 --> 05:10.040
So overall, I've, you know, I found the experience to be above average, I'd say, and I find myself

05:10.040 --> 05:14.160
on most systems now installing it alongside Chrome and Firefox.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.800
Have you used it much after you gave it that initial go?

05:16.800 --> 05:21.400
No, I'll be honest, I kind of got installed, played around with it, seemed like Chrome

05:21.400 --> 05:24.900
but with a Microsoft stamp and so I didn't keep using it.

05:24.900 --> 05:28.880
But I can definitely appreciate how, yeah, having an extra browser lying around.

05:28.880 --> 05:32.020
And I'll be honest, I've not really been impressed with Chrome lately.

05:32.020 --> 05:35.140
Some of those same things you mentioned, they're definitely bugging me.

05:35.140 --> 05:38.440
So maybe a less Google version might be what I need.

05:38.440 --> 05:41.220
Yeah, I don't think you're going to see Linux users in mass switch, though.

05:41.220 --> 05:45.560
You might see some enterprise adoption, some educational space adoption where people need

05:45.560 --> 05:46.560
compatibility.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.720
But you know, I mean, I don't think this is going to be like a revolution at the regular

05:49.720 --> 05:50.720
Linux user level.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.480
No, I don't think so.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.360
I mean, I'm going to keep using Firefox.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.800
But hey, don't we want a little browser diversity?

05:56.800 --> 06:00.040
Unfortunately, Edge doesn't quite count there.

06:00.040 --> 06:06.840
Well, transitioning from open source web browsers to open source messaging systems and clients,

06:06.840 --> 06:11.840
we noticed EMS the folks behind the element matrix chat client and the matrix hosting

06:11.840 --> 06:17.240
service have announced element one this week, which promises to bring matrix WhatsApp signal

06:17.240 --> 06:20.560
and telegram chats all into one place.

06:20.560 --> 06:25.520
The service is priced at just $5 a month, and they're offering quote, a fully managed

06:25.520 --> 06:31.320
consumer experience with the bridging and hosting managed by the experienced EMS team.

06:31.320 --> 06:36.960
They say it's also basically unlimited usage with some reasonable fair use limits to protect

06:36.960 --> 06:37.960
against bots.

06:37.960 --> 06:38.960
Yeah, that's pretty understandable.

06:38.960 --> 06:44.560
You see, the fundamental value pitch here is that you have a lot of chats online, potentially.

06:44.560 --> 06:45.560
I sure do.

06:45.560 --> 06:46.560
Yeah.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.800
And you'd like all of it in one place.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.320
And for some of us, that is a very tempting product.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.800
And you could even see them expanding this beyond just what I've listed and even maybe

06:54.800 --> 06:59.800
going to things like Discord, Slack, Mattermost and lots of other services that can just kind

06:59.800 --> 07:01.680
of layer them on top of this.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.860
But there are some trade offs.

07:03.860 --> 07:08.200
Bridges support conversations, invites, images and attachments, but they don't support voice

07:08.200 --> 07:12.960
or video calls between platforms, although your voice and video attachments should be

07:12.960 --> 07:14.600
supported just fine.

07:14.600 --> 07:19.680
And the big caveat that right now, end to end encryption is broken in order to make

07:19.680 --> 07:21.680
the bridges work.

07:21.680 --> 07:27.120
But the EMS team do say they've taken some efforts to reduce that risk, noting, quote,

07:27.120 --> 07:32.480
the bridges operate in Elements trusted EMS environment with no content scanning or data

07:32.480 --> 07:33.480
mining.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.920
And of course, element to element or any other matrix app supporting end to end encryption,

07:37.920 --> 07:41.340
those conversations are still end to end encrypted by default.

07:41.340 --> 07:43.480
They also support voice and video calls.

07:43.480 --> 07:48.720
If you're someone who manages a lot of online communities or just participates in them,

07:48.720 --> 07:53.000
and you've been thinking about getting into the world of matrix, this might really be

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
a no brainer.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.960
I can't really think of an easier way to get started with this kind of stuff and have a

07:56.960 --> 07:58.560
nice hosted, curated experience.

07:58.560 --> 08:02.400
Yeah, in fact, setting a matrix can be one of the barriers to adoption and they've really

08:02.400 --> 08:04.120
packaged it all together here.

08:04.120 --> 08:08.440
I also think that you're right, Chris, when you say expect more bridges coming soon.

08:08.440 --> 08:12.760
This might be a nice funding method where EMS gets the money and some of that gets directed

08:12.760 --> 08:15.360
to developing better or future bridges.

08:15.360 --> 08:19.680
I see the hint quite strongly at this on their blog saying, we'll be listening carefully

08:19.680 --> 08:24.020
to all feedback to see how to develop element one in the future.

08:24.020 --> 08:28.500
It could be the people want more bridges added, or perhaps end to end encryption for existing

08:28.500 --> 08:35.000
bridges might be deemed more important, or something else entirely, either way, or all

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
ears.

08:36.000 --> 08:40.840
I like what you're saying there about this being a way for users to fund EMS and element

08:40.840 --> 08:46.280
development and that reminds me a little bit of the Nebuchadnezzar setup for Home Assistant.

08:46.280 --> 08:50.740
That's the commercial organization above Home Assistant and they offer a Home Assistant

08:50.740 --> 08:54.380
remote access service that's very reasonably priced.

08:54.380 --> 08:59.320
It's full of features and it gives Home Assistant great functionality that you're going to kind

08:59.320 --> 09:03.760
of want anyways, which is the check of a few boxes and a monthly subscription.

09:03.760 --> 09:07.960
But what you're really doing with that subscription is you're financing future development of Home

09:07.960 --> 09:09.000
Assistant.

09:09.000 --> 09:13.000
And so by subscribing to this element one, you'd be helping the element organization

09:13.000 --> 09:15.840
continue as just a, you know, a matrix fan.

09:15.840 --> 09:19.720
So I think this isn't quite ready for me, but I am definitely on the fence.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.280
I'd love to see a Slack bridge set up.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.520
Ooh, that would be nice.

09:23.520 --> 09:24.520
Yeah, yeah.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.280
Or just a one click Discord bridge.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.480
Then I could close a few more Electron apps.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.800
That's one of the main goals here.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.040
One Electron app to rule them all, Wes.

09:32.040 --> 09:36.200
And while we're talking about the element chat app, the chat client added export support

09:36.200 --> 09:38.340
this week in version 1.91.

09:38.340 --> 09:41.960
So with this latest release, you now have the ability to export chat from all rooms

09:41.960 --> 09:45.760
and DMs on the element web and desktop apps.

09:45.760 --> 09:49.600
And this new export ability was definitely one of the development team's most upvoted

09:49.600 --> 09:53.560
features and the implementation looks pretty solid.

09:53.560 --> 09:58.160
Not only are you able to choose what you want to export, the current timeline, the entire

09:58.160 --> 10:03.680
timeline, or just a specific number of messages, but you're also able to choose how to export

10:03.680 --> 10:16.100
them HTML, plain text, or my favorite, JSON.

10:16.100 --> 10:20.880
As we record on a Sunday evening, Linux 5.15 is scheduled to be released just momentarily.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.600
This merge window opened back in September and there's some particularly interesting

10:24.600 --> 10:30.160
new features and changes in this release, including one that I've been dreading for

10:30.160 --> 10:31.160
weeks.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.200
Oh, we're going to touch on that.

10:33.200 --> 10:39.880
But first, one of the most talked about new features is the new NTFS3 file system driver,

10:39.880 --> 10:42.040
originally developed by Paragon Software.

10:42.040 --> 10:48.840
It feels like we've been reading about this one forever, but now it's finally shipping.

10:48.840 --> 10:54.160
Something else we've been following closely, the Apple M1 IOMMU driver was added, among

10:54.160 --> 11:00.800
a whole bunch of other ongoing work, adding support for Apple's new SoC in the kernel.

11:00.800 --> 11:07.120
But the feature I know you've been dreading, this release merges in KSMBD.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.120
So good up, Wes.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.120
I know you're loving this.

11:09.120 --> 11:12.940
This is just crazy to me, an in kernel Samba file server.

11:12.940 --> 11:17.840
You know, SMB, the Windows file sharing protocol that accepts remote connections over the network

11:17.840 --> 11:19.520
is now built into the kernel.

11:19.520 --> 11:21.780
And we're trying to figure how this is even going to work.

11:21.780 --> 11:25.720
Is the kernel going to open up an interface and accept Samba connections over a new interface

11:25.720 --> 11:32.520
like Wirecard does, or is it going to actually open up the remote port somehow on your machine?

11:32.520 --> 11:36.280
Like, we don't know, but I have a suspicion we'll find out.

11:36.280 --> 11:42.960
And the overall message is this isn't a replacement for traditional Samba for most workloads.

11:42.960 --> 11:48.040
But KSMBD does promise a high performance and more lightweight option for those of you

11:48.040 --> 11:49.040
who might need it.

11:49.040 --> 11:52.120
Hey, nothing better for my local network.

11:52.120 --> 11:56.320
And really, I suppose that shouldn't be too hard to do when your service is built right

11:56.320 --> 11:58.160
into the kernel.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.640
But that's definitely something we're going to test.

12:01.640 --> 12:07.640
Interestingly, Samsung's use case for this is lightweight file sharing on Android devices

12:07.640 --> 12:09.780
and other embedded applications.

12:09.780 --> 12:13.720
But we just think it might be fun to try a Raspberry Pi file server.

12:13.720 --> 12:17.960
I do have to admit, I am looking forward to that.

12:17.960 --> 12:22.840
Another big thing that lands in 5.15 is the preempt RT locking code.

12:22.840 --> 12:27.480
This represents the bulk of the previously outstanding real time patches for the Linux

12:27.480 --> 12:28.480
kernel.

12:28.480 --> 12:32.860
So the mainline kernel is getting close to holding all of the needed real time functionality.

12:32.860 --> 12:38.040
And while real time functionality isn't needed by most of us, this is going to be huge for

12:38.040 --> 12:40.100
the workloads that do require it.

12:40.100 --> 12:44.160
We know that our friends at SpaceX and JPL, for example, maintain their own patch sets

12:44.160 --> 12:48.920
to Linux just to enable real time functionality on the devices they deploy Linux on.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.920
And this has been a long time coming.

12:50.920 --> 12:56.520
The preempt RT patch has been available for every long term stable version of the kernel

12:56.520 --> 13:00.040
since kernel version 2.6.11.

13:00.040 --> 13:07.960
AMD users also get a lot of nice to haves, including future AMD users of the Steam Deck.

13:07.960 --> 13:13.400
The AMD Van Gogh APU audio driver was merged in 5.15, and the Steam Deck will be among

13:13.400 --> 13:16.360
the first hardware to actually benefit from it.

13:16.360 --> 13:20.720
Really, there is just a lot going on in 5.15.

13:20.720 --> 13:25.080
And as always, Michael Haribol has a great write up at Ferronix, which we'll have a

13:25.080 --> 13:27.740
link to in the show notes.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.720
And of course, the kernel never sleeps.

13:29.720 --> 13:36.040
With the release of 5.15, the merge window for 5.16 will open up pretty much immediately.

13:36.040 --> 13:44.000
And there are already many exciting things in the works.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.480
You know why I use Linode?

13:45.480 --> 13:46.920
Because I'm not my own ISP.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.740
I don't have 11 data centers around the world.

13:49.740 --> 13:53.120
And I haven't been deploying servers in the cloud for 18 years.

13:53.120 --> 13:55.520
I have been deploying servers for more than 18 years.

13:55.520 --> 13:59.080
And that's also another reason why I use Linode.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.520
Because I'm really blown away by what they have here.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.480
First of all, the pricing is just fantastic.

14:03.480 --> 14:08.120
It's 30% to 50% less than the major duopoly hypervisors out there.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.680
They've made a really great dashboard.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.960
I think they revved it like a couple of years ago, and now they've just been really kind

14:12.960 --> 14:17.960
of iterating on something really great because it's definitely a refined product.

14:17.960 --> 14:22.000
It manages to strike the balance between simple but give you advanced functionality when you

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
need it.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.680
On top of that, they have a really flushed out API and a command line client you can

14:27.680 --> 14:32.600
use on your OS of choice to interact with Linode and do things like upload files or

14:32.600 --> 14:35.880
manage a box, create a snapshot before you make a change.

14:35.880 --> 14:39.320
What I actually do on my machines is usually I have a dropdown terminal on whatever desktop

14:39.320 --> 14:40.520
I'm using.

14:40.520 --> 14:44.120
And almost always, that's where I have the Linode command line tool.

14:44.120 --> 14:47.320
So if I'm working on something, I can have that just ready to go.

14:47.320 --> 14:52.160
Drop that down, execute a command like a snapshot or something real quick, and I'm good to go.

14:52.160 --> 14:56.000
Linode is really focused on giving you a simple but powerful setup.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.640
And you can go with one of their pre-built stacks, just one click deploy kind of thing,

14:59.640 --> 15:01.600
and they got a lot of good ones for that.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.240
That's a great way to learn too.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.800
Or you can go the DIY route.

15:04.800 --> 15:09.960
I've actually found guides in Linode tutorials on how to replace their images with my own

15:09.960 --> 15:14.940
custom Linux image, which I use for this VPN monster that I run for my LTE connections.

15:14.940 --> 15:18.280
But I was just blown away that they were like, not only did they allow it, but they were

15:18.280 --> 15:20.440
showing me how to do it.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.220
That's what's so cool about Linode.

15:22.220 --> 15:23.220
They're in it for the tech.

15:23.220 --> 15:25.280
Like I mentioned, they are their own ISP.

15:25.280 --> 15:29.840
When they did that years ago, it was like kind of like a controversial thing that Linode

15:29.840 --> 15:32.360
was using Linux as firewall and routers.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.600
Like what are they doing?

15:33.600 --> 15:34.800
They can't do that.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.380
And now it's just as commonplace.

15:36.380 --> 15:39.560
You see Linux in so many places in our network infrastructure now.

15:39.560 --> 15:42.240
So many people now do infrastructure as code.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.160
Linode was all about that early on.

15:44.160 --> 15:48.320
When things really got cooking in the cloud age, it was really when virtualization became

15:48.320 --> 15:49.520
available.

15:49.520 --> 15:52.140
And that was something Linode saw coming before anybody else.

15:52.140 --> 15:55.240
They saw what you could do with that before anybody did because they're geeks and they

15:55.240 --> 15:56.800
played around with this stuff.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.520
And now their service has a bunch of great features.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.560
I love their S3 compatible object storage.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.280
They have cloud firewalls, DDoS protection, VLAN support.

16:04.280 --> 16:07.160
Of course, they've got a powerful DNS manager because you're going to need that.

16:07.160 --> 16:11.480
Kubernetes support, super fast networking, and a lot more.

16:11.480 --> 16:15.760
So go get that $100 and really get an opportunity to try it.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.340
Linode.com slash LAN.

16:17.340 --> 16:22.640
Go there, get $100 on a new account for 60 days, and you support the show.

16:22.640 --> 16:26.280
It's real easy to support the show and try out something great.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.360
Linode.com slash LAN.

16:29.360 --> 16:32.080
And Linux Action News is made possible by Ting.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.080
Linux.ting.com.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.520
Ting's my mobile service provider.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.440
They are a mobile virtual network operator.

16:37.440 --> 16:42.000
That means they focus on the customer support and a great value.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.460
Go find a plan that fits at linux.ting.com.

16:44.460 --> 16:47.680
They have a special deal going on right now as I record this.

16:47.680 --> 16:52.600
So if you're listening around release time, they have very special rates up to 35% off

16:52.600 --> 16:54.040
on some of their plans.

16:54.040 --> 16:58.880
You go to linux.ting.com and get $25 in credit so you could really start working here.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.560
Ting has fantastic plans and rates.

17:01.560 --> 17:05.640
Whatever you need, a little bit of data, a lot of data, unlimited talk, unlimited text,

17:05.640 --> 17:06.960
they've got plans for you.

17:06.960 --> 17:10.820
And they've got simple to understand terms and no contracts.

17:10.820 --> 17:12.020
It's simple to switch to Ting.

17:12.020 --> 17:14.480
You go to linux.ting.com.

17:14.480 --> 17:18.660
Pretty much any phone's going to work with Ting because they support multiple networks.

17:18.660 --> 17:21.760
They have coast to coast network coverage, and they know.

17:21.760 --> 17:22.760
They know the math.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.560
They know what works best in your area.

17:24.560 --> 17:25.560
So you go to linux.ting.com.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.240
You check out your current phone.

17:27.240 --> 17:28.240
You create an account.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.080
You pick a plan that fits you just right.

17:30.080 --> 17:33.600
And seriously right now, if you're listening around release time, they've always got great

17:33.600 --> 17:34.600
pricing.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.200
But if you're listening around release time, go to linux.ting.com.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.480
Check out these prices.

17:38.480 --> 17:41.020
If you fit everything, everything looks good, they're going to send you a SIM card.

17:41.020 --> 17:42.460
You get that right away.

17:42.460 --> 17:45.560
You pop that in your phone, and you get activated online in minutes.

17:45.560 --> 17:48.920
You can pretty much do this entire process without having to talk to customer support

17:48.920 --> 17:50.980
because they've got a great dashboard.

17:50.980 --> 17:54.720
But if you do need customer support, they've got the best in the business.

17:54.720 --> 17:58.220
That's something Ting is really focused on, so they've got you covered there.

17:58.220 --> 17:59.300
They send you that SIM card.

17:59.300 --> 18:00.300
You pop it in.

18:00.300 --> 18:01.300
You get going.

18:01.300 --> 18:02.520
But if you ever have any trouble, they're there for you.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.720
The next generation of Ting Mobile is incredible.

18:04.720 --> 18:08.200
And right now, the pricing is record breaking.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.240
So get started.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.320
Try it out and see why I've been using it forever.

18:11.320 --> 18:15.520
Go to linux.ting.com.

18:15.520 --> 18:19.760
Big change for network administrators is under development in Red Hat land.

18:19.760 --> 18:26.040
It appears the Fedora project, and further downstream, Red Hat Enterprise 9, is considering

18:26.040 --> 18:30.320
removing support for the Network Information Service, or NIS.

18:30.320 --> 18:36.520
NIS solved a problem in the early days of Unix networking as the number of systems grew,

18:36.520 --> 18:41.720
became quite a chore to copy around your Etsy password file and keep those UIDs in sync.

18:41.720 --> 18:47.240
NIS was one of the first forms of any sort of single sign-on on a local network.

18:47.240 --> 18:50.000
Not to date myself, but I'm sure some of you out there already know this.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.820
But when I was entering the industry, some folks still called it Yellow Pages.

18:53.820 --> 18:55.440
And I always liked that name better.

18:55.440 --> 18:59.400
But as you can probably guess, trademark issues ensued.

18:59.400 --> 19:03.900
And the entire Unix community was just exhausted by trademark fights by this point.

19:03.900 --> 19:08.840
So the name was just changed to NIS, and then later NIS Plus in 1992.

19:08.840 --> 19:14.640
However, you'll still end up using functions and commands that start with YP.

19:14.640 --> 19:20.280
Now these days, Linux systems still carry NIS support, and the PAM Unix authentication

19:20.280 --> 19:22.480
module supports it as well.

19:22.480 --> 19:25.880
And distributions still package the various NIS utilities.

19:25.880 --> 19:31.400
At the beginning of October though, Bjorn Esser suggested that Fedora, at least, might

19:31.400 --> 19:33.800
stop doing so soon.

19:33.800 --> 19:38.680
Esser is working on a project to replace PAM Unix, which also receives unfortunately little

19:38.680 --> 19:42.840
attention these days, with a more straightforward alternative.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.680
One of the things that would make this work a little simpler would be to just drop support

19:46.680 --> 19:48.340
for NIS.

19:48.340 --> 19:51.560
So he wanted to know if anyone was still actually using it.

19:51.560 --> 19:54.140
Well, and they did hear from some of those users, didn't they?

19:54.140 --> 19:56.680
They seem to exist, surprise, surprise.

19:56.680 --> 20:02.320
LWN notes they were perhaps most aptly described by Stefan John Smogen, who said, quote, the

20:02.320 --> 20:07.700
places I've seen it still being used are in universities run by people who learned sysadmin

20:07.700 --> 20:10.320
in the 90s and early 2000s.

20:10.320 --> 20:11.320
Ouch.

20:11.320 --> 20:13.160
That burns a little less.

20:13.160 --> 20:17.480
He goes on to say, it's a lightweight system that is simple to set up and tends to be the

20:17.480 --> 20:22.960
go to stick for a lot of we put this together in 1999 with rail six, and we've upgraded

20:22.960 --> 20:25.240
it ever since type places.

20:25.240 --> 20:29.800
Another commenter was quick to ask whether any simple alternatives might exist.

20:29.800 --> 20:33.960
Unfortunately, the answer would appear to be no.

20:33.960 --> 20:38.880
Smogen responded, there is LDAP, but that isn't light.

20:38.880 --> 20:42.680
And there is Kerberos, but that isn't easy.

20:42.680 --> 20:47.520
He added that an awful lot of the quote, cool kids just defer to one of the large service

20:47.520 --> 20:52.440
providers for authentication services these days, a solution that doesn't seem likely

20:52.440 --> 20:58.280
to appeal to anybody who's been making the effort to keep NIS running all these years.

20:58.280 --> 21:03.180
That's really the no win scenario part of this because you could you could kind of mitigate

21:03.180 --> 21:06.800
this with modern infrastructure management tools.

21:06.800 --> 21:11.980
Of course, you could you could deploy free IPA and essentially replicate a lot of Active

21:11.980 --> 21:13.840
Directory type functionality.

21:13.840 --> 21:19.200
But none of that is as easy or quick to set up as NIS.

21:19.200 --> 21:23.580
In my opinion, it's a bit of a shame that some universal distro agnostic and universally

21:23.580 --> 21:29.600
supported Active Directory alternative hasn't been built and adopted by the wider community.

21:29.600 --> 21:36.640
From my days in both the industry of enterprise and banking and my days in education and

21:36.640 --> 21:42.920
IT support there, I think I can make a pretty solid argument that a lack of a drop in replacement

21:42.920 --> 21:44.200
for Active Directory.

21:44.200 --> 21:48.920
In other words, something that's practically built into every distro, not having that has

21:48.920 --> 21:53.740
slowed adoption in the enterprise and in the education desktop market easily.

21:53.740 --> 21:58.120
And I think it's left the low end market open for Chromebooks to just dominate.

21:58.120 --> 22:02.080
And of course, Windows continues to dominate in the higher end market.

22:02.080 --> 22:04.240
I think I have to agree.

22:04.240 --> 22:08.480
We do see more and more Linux desktops in the enterprise over time, but they tend to

22:08.480 --> 22:12.720
be rolling their own solutions for user management if you're lucky enough to have user management

22:12.720 --> 22:13.960
at all.

22:13.960 --> 22:19.220
But given that it seems round nine will not support NIS, and even if Fedora punts this

22:19.220 --> 22:23.320
change for maybe a cycle or two, the final days are nigh.

22:23.320 --> 22:25.320
Well, support still remains for now.

22:25.320 --> 22:31.240
I mean, what an incredible run over the decades from the very early days of network Unix to

22:31.240 --> 22:37.120
2021, no matter how you slice that, that is an extremely impressive run.

22:37.120 --> 22:41.140
And I feel nostalgic for something that may be fading away just a little bit.

22:41.140 --> 22:44.320
Maybe that's why it made it in today's episode.

22:44.320 --> 22:49.040
And while we're speaking of Fedora on Tuesday's Linux Unplugged project, lead Matthew Miller

22:49.040 --> 22:55.200
will join us for our exit interview with Fedora 34 and our review of Fedora 35, which is scheduled

22:55.200 --> 22:57.160
to release Tuesday, November 4th.

22:57.160 --> 23:02.280
Yeah, that'll be episode 430 of Linux Unplugged, and I think that's going to be a really good

23:02.280 --> 23:03.280
conversation.

23:03.280 --> 23:06.960
But we'll keep an eye on everything going on in the world of Linux and open source.

23:06.960 --> 23:12.240
So be sure you go to linuxactionnews.com slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

23:12.240 --> 23:16.220

And don't forget links to everything we cover today at linuxactionnews.com slash 213.

23:21.600 --> 23:26.280
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.360
Thanks for joining us.

23:27.360 --> 23:56.520
And that's all the news for this week.
