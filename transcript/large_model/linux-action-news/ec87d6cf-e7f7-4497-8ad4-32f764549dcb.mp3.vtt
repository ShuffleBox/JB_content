00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 169, recorded on December 20th, 2020.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
I'm Chris.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
I'm Wes.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
And I'm Joe.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.040
Hello, gentlemen, and Joe, welcome back to the show.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.720
Well, it's good to be here.

00:15.720 --> 00:21.400
Now it is that time of year where we look back at what we said would happen in 2020,

00:21.400 --> 00:24.620
and we predict what will happen in 2021.

00:24.620 --> 00:28.200
And to help us go through those previous predictions, Joe's back.

00:28.200 --> 00:31.820
And so since you're our guest of honor, Joe, we're going to start with you.

00:31.820 --> 00:36.720
Last year, you predicted that in 2020, we'd be able to buy a RISC-V based single board

00:36.720 --> 00:43.600
computer that's capable of running a full Linux desktop, maybe Debian and XFCE, perhaps,

00:43.600 --> 00:47.520
and it will cost no more than the most expensive Raspberry Pi.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.320
Unfortunately, this did not happen.

00:49.320 --> 00:53.480
No, clearly, I was wrong about this, although I listened to it and I did predict an eight

00:53.480 --> 00:58.520
gigabyte RAM Raspberry Pi, so maybe half a point for that.

00:58.520 --> 00:59.520
Yeah.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.520
Yeah.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.000
Accidental half point there.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.680
You could tell it's a true Joe prediction, too, because it's got XFCE.

01:04.680 --> 01:05.680
Yeah.

01:05.680 --> 01:06.680
Of course.

01:06.680 --> 01:09.040
Well, that's what he would be running with it, right?

01:09.040 --> 01:10.040
I mean, yeah.

01:10.040 --> 01:11.580
But the eight gig Pi, that's interesting.

01:11.580 --> 01:13.120
Was that just a casual mention?

01:13.120 --> 01:14.120
Yeah, yeah.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.080
Well, all right.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.360
This one, I'm kind of curious to know what you guys think.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.360
I'll do mine.

01:19.360 --> 01:24.160
I said Richard Stallman would reemerge on the talk scene, not necessarily affiliated

01:24.160 --> 01:29.160
with any particular group, but he'd be like a mercenary for free software out there and

01:29.160 --> 01:32.800
about and we'd see him sort of pop up a little bit more.

01:32.800 --> 01:33.800
Interesting.

01:33.800 --> 01:34.800
Do you think I got that one?

01:34.800 --> 01:35.800
Okay.

01:35.800 --> 01:38.840
Well, this year, it's a little hard to tell because the scene is a bit different.

01:38.840 --> 01:39.960
I don't know.

01:39.960 --> 01:44.160
I don't know that he's at least anywhere near as prominent as he once was.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.520
He has done some conferences like Emacs Conf 2020.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.440
He was there and he did a couple of talks there.

01:49.440 --> 01:54.600
One like AMA type thing, which is on YouTube, which I watched the other day.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.560
So he's definitely not totally disappeared.

01:56.560 --> 01:58.300
He definitely did come back.

01:58.300 --> 02:02.700
And that was what we were talking about was the whole political angle of it, that it kind

02:02.700 --> 02:04.240
of been canceled.

02:04.240 --> 02:09.920
And now he's kind of come back and it hasn't been as much of a stink about it as I thought

02:09.920 --> 02:10.920
there might be.

02:10.920 --> 02:11.920
Yeah, that's true.

02:11.920 --> 02:12.920
There really hasn't been.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.880
I guess I did kind of, although I didn't predict that there would be, I did kind of assume

02:15.880 --> 02:16.880
there would be.

02:16.880 --> 02:18.000
I think we all did.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.040
So I'm kind of getting this one, it sounds like then.

02:20.040 --> 02:24.480
I think also maybe if you look at it as did Richard Stallman totally fade away, the answer

02:24.480 --> 02:25.480
is no.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.480
And I think in that spirit, yeah, you get a point.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.480
Yeah.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.480
All right.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.080
Well, on to Joe's next prediction.

02:31.080 --> 02:35.600
By this time next year, there'll be a license that solves the AWS problem.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.040
Well, still being open source.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.460
Now, this is interesting.

02:39.460 --> 02:44.000
There's a lot of definitions here, particularly open source and the AWS problem.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.840
And do you think you got this one, Joe?

02:45.840 --> 02:46.840
Not quite.

02:46.840 --> 02:47.840
Almost.

02:47.840 --> 02:53.560
The AWS problem, of course, is that the likes of Amazon are taking open source software

02:53.560 --> 03:00.600
and selling it as a service and not contributing financially or even code back to the original

03:00.600 --> 03:01.840
projects.

03:01.840 --> 03:05.960
And so we had various attempts last year at it.

03:05.960 --> 03:10.960
And I think we had a pretty good one this year, which was the timescale license, which

03:10.960 --> 03:14.320
is pretty close, but it's not quite open source.

03:14.320 --> 03:17.280
So I don't think I can claim a full point here.

03:17.280 --> 03:21.480
Yeah, timescale does get close, but I don't think it was quite the spirit of it.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.320
So I tend to agree there.

03:23.320 --> 03:27.080
There still is that overall AWS problem, not fully solved.

03:27.080 --> 03:30.160
I guess this next year, we'll see what happens.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.920
All right, Chris, I think you're up for now.

03:32.920 --> 03:33.920
All right.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.440
So this one, it seemed like everything was in place.

03:37.440 --> 03:41.400
There are almost years of little hints leading up to this prediction.

03:41.400 --> 03:44.000
And I thought it was going to pop this year.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.160
But I don't think I can make that claim.

03:46.160 --> 03:50.500
I said that NVIDIA would show various types of support.

03:50.500 --> 03:55.320
Maybe it was code, documentation, developer time, et cetera, that would enable the nouveau

03:55.320 --> 04:01.040
driver to become really functional, close to fully functional for basic daily driver

04:01.040 --> 04:04.320
uses with the NVIDIA graphics card.

04:04.320 --> 04:06.800
But it just did not materialize.

04:06.800 --> 04:12.800
I even saw rumors and suggestions that certain NVIDIA developers were having conversations

04:12.800 --> 04:17.460
with certain Red Hat developers to make some of this work, like on the DL.

04:17.460 --> 04:20.840
But nothing I can point to officially and say, yeah, they stepped up and they really

04:20.840 --> 04:21.840
enabled the project.

04:21.840 --> 04:25.480
Yeah, weren't we expecting some sort of conference talk that ultimately got canceled?

04:25.480 --> 04:28.840
But it seemed like this was in the works and I guess just never realized.

04:28.840 --> 04:29.840
Yep.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.840
There was a talk that was scheduled.

04:31.840 --> 04:36.580
There was, if you go back to 2019, there were several announcements about how documentation

04:36.580 --> 04:37.580
was going to get delivered.

04:37.580 --> 04:42.360
There was a GitHub repo set up, and it just all went nowhere.

04:42.360 --> 04:43.360
And you got to wonder what happened.

04:43.360 --> 04:49.040
And in the meantime, AMD just seems to have refined their strategy on Linux.

04:49.040 --> 04:52.280
We had Michael Arbel on recently, and he was talking about what a good year it was for

04:52.280 --> 04:53.800
AMD on Linux.

04:53.800 --> 05:00.000
And you look at launch day with the 6800 series, and it's pretty solid on Linux.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.640
And then you look over at NVIDIA and they've just really done nothing to improve the experience.

05:05.640 --> 05:09.320
They've continued to make their driver and they continue to refine that.

05:09.320 --> 05:12.680
It does perform well if you're willing to jump through the proprietary hoops, of course.

05:12.680 --> 05:16.440
Yep, but nothing to really address the fact that AMD and Intel just have it all baked

05:16.440 --> 05:18.120
into the Linux kernel now.

05:18.120 --> 05:21.800
And that's what I was really hoping to see, some kind of help and support there that would

05:21.800 --> 05:23.920
make this thing more functional.

05:23.920 --> 05:27.120
And it just didn't happen.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.680
Linode.com slash LAN.

05:28.680 --> 05:33.760
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards your new account and go there to support the

05:33.760 --> 05:35.040
show.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.960
Linode is our cloud hosting provider.

05:36.960 --> 05:41.080
All of us here on the show, we use Linode for our personal stuff and all of our business

05:41.080 --> 05:42.080
stuff.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.400
And I like that they're independently owned.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.400
That really makes a difference.

05:44.400 --> 05:47.920
I trust that they're going to be around for a long time.

05:47.920 --> 05:54.200
And they started forever ago in 2003 as one of the first companies in cloud computing.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.720
There's so many little nice features that you don't even really have to worry about.

05:57.720 --> 06:02.440
For example, I was setting up a new rig and I was just sending a ton of data because it

06:02.440 --> 06:06.280
was going to be the central node in this mesh network that I was setting up.

06:06.280 --> 06:08.560
And so I was just sending a bunch of data to get it all synced up.

06:08.560 --> 06:12.080
So when I turned everything on, it would have all of the files.

06:12.080 --> 06:17.440
And about 15 minutes into this process, maybe 20 minutes into the process, I get a message

06:17.440 --> 06:18.440
from Alex.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.080
He says, what is going on?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.560
What are you doing?

06:21.560 --> 06:25.920
Because I had these little threshold alerts set up that were just perfect little reminders

06:25.920 --> 06:27.900
that, hey, something's worth checking in on here.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.180
Your box is doing something a little unusual.

06:30.180 --> 06:34.040
And the number one thing that I know from running servers in production is that is a

06:34.040 --> 06:37.480
great way to tell that something is wrong, that somebody has owned your box, something's

06:37.480 --> 06:42.040
going on, or you have a process gun haywire, or something's syncing that you didn't expect

06:42.040 --> 06:43.040
to sync.

06:43.040 --> 06:47.440
These thresholds let you check in on things like CPU or bandwidth transfer in my case.

06:47.440 --> 06:48.440
It generates a nice email.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.440
It says, hey, you're not in trouble.

06:49.440 --> 06:50.440
It's no big deal.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.840
But this just meets the threshold, which you set.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.340
And so we're letting you know that you've exceeded that.

06:55.340 --> 06:59.360
And it was really kind of cool because I thought if we got that on the matrix server, we'd

06:59.360 --> 07:01.240
know something was wrong.

07:01.240 --> 07:03.600
That would be a sign that we should go check in on that kind of thing.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.040
Or something was going really, really right.

07:06.040 --> 07:10.280
It's a party on the matrix server, which we also host on Linode, of course.

07:10.280 --> 07:11.280
So go check them out.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.740
Because with that $100 credit, you can really build some awesome infrastructure with some

07:14.740 --> 07:18.020
great tools around it to really make it run solid for you.

07:18.020 --> 07:19.020
So it's stable.

07:19.020 --> 07:20.020
It's fast.

07:20.020 --> 07:21.180
They have 11 data centers around the world.

07:21.180 --> 07:25.220
You can choose whatever is close to you or maybe close to your clients.

07:25.220 --> 07:28.080
And of course, that dashboard makes it easy to tie it all together.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.840
And unlike entry level hosting services that lock you into their platform, Linode gives

07:31.840 --> 07:36.040
you full back end access to customize and control your server to fit your needs.

07:36.040 --> 07:40.360
And they support tools like Kubernetes and Terraform, which great opportunity to learn

07:40.360 --> 07:44.340
or great opportunity to plug it into your existing management system.

07:44.340 --> 07:47.080
So go to linode.com slash LAN.

07:47.080 --> 07:48.080
You go there.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.600
You get that $100, 60 day credit towards the new account.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.720
And you support the show.

07:51.720 --> 07:55.580
You make it possible for independent media to give away their content for free by going

07:55.580 --> 07:57.720
to linode.com slash LAN.

07:57.720 --> 07:58.720
OK.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.780
So I'm not even officially on this show anymore.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.800
So I'm not going to be making any predictions.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.620
So that's a good excuse for me to just be the unofficial referee.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.940
So you two have got to do two each, I reckon.

08:09.940 --> 08:11.460
So who's going to go first?

08:11.460 --> 08:12.460
Wes?

08:12.460 --> 08:13.460
Yeah, all right.

08:13.460 --> 08:14.460
I'll do that.

08:14.460 --> 08:18.180
This first one doesn't necessarily make me happy to say, but that's not how this game

08:18.180 --> 08:19.180
is played, right?

08:19.180 --> 08:22.560
I'm going to predict that Mozilla kills Pocket.

08:22.560 --> 08:23.560
Pocket, huh?

08:23.560 --> 08:24.560
Yeah.

08:24.560 --> 08:26.260
You know, it just never really felt like a great fit.

08:26.260 --> 08:27.660
They never open sourced it.

08:27.660 --> 08:30.640
And it doesn't really seem like they've done anything with it.

08:30.640 --> 08:31.640
No, I'm not opposed.

08:31.640 --> 08:32.820
They've used Pocket.

08:32.820 --> 08:34.980
Having a nice read it later service is pretty handy.

08:34.980 --> 08:37.740
It makes sense as a feature in a browser, really.

08:37.740 --> 08:39.660
They just like so many other things.

08:39.660 --> 08:40.660
It's rotting away.

08:40.660 --> 08:45.060
And with the, you know, the downsizing, the new version of Mozilla, I just don't know

08:45.060 --> 08:48.300
that there's a ton of effort that they would have anyway to go in there.

08:48.300 --> 08:49.740
So we'll see.

08:49.740 --> 08:54.540
The thing that makes me think this might not happen is that just the other day I had a

08:54.540 --> 08:58.880
new installation of Linux and a new Firefox without my profile or anything.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.260
And the first thing it said was, hey, try Pocket.

09:01.260 --> 09:04.260
So they're still heavily promoting it to new users.

09:04.260 --> 09:07.660
So I can see it, but I can also not see it.

09:07.660 --> 09:11.060
I think we won't see it open sourced either way.

09:11.060 --> 09:14.740
Isn't that just like the only exit strategy they have for Pocket that doesn't piss everyone

09:14.740 --> 09:15.740
off?

09:15.740 --> 09:16.740
Yeah, I think so.

09:16.740 --> 09:21.020
If they just kill it and they fail to open source it, I think that's even worse PR for

09:21.020 --> 09:22.020
them.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.820
But I could totally see your resources argument here.

09:24.820 --> 09:26.040
They don't really have the resources.

09:26.040 --> 09:29.520
They haven't really got a solid way to monetize it in a way that's moving the needle for them

09:29.520 --> 09:31.620
financially at all.

09:31.620 --> 09:38.500
So they may have to focus in on what they can do well and what they can generate a profit

09:38.500 --> 09:39.500
from.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.820
I could see Pocket not being on that list.

09:41.820 --> 09:43.940
But how they handle that, that's going to be critical.

09:43.940 --> 09:45.260
And you're not saying they're going to open source it.

09:45.260 --> 09:46.260
You're saying they kill it.

09:46.260 --> 09:47.260
I say they kill it.

09:47.260 --> 09:48.780
They wind it down.

09:48.780 --> 09:51.900
There's some sort of timeline where it's going to be going away.

09:51.900 --> 09:53.460
All right.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.060
We're locking that one in.

09:55.060 --> 09:59.140
So mine is a little safer of a bet than yours.

09:59.140 --> 10:04.900
I predict that at least three traditional CentOS style clones will ship their quote

10:04.900 --> 10:07.100
unquote 1.0 in 2021.

10:07.100 --> 10:08.100
All right.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.060
Well, I think that's where we'll first need the ref.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.980
What are we counting as 1.0?

10:11.980 --> 10:17.100
Is that just like a release that's ready for the general public to consume and deploy production

10:17.100 --> 10:18.100
wise?

10:18.100 --> 10:19.100
Yeah.

10:19.100 --> 10:22.020
I don't know if they may call it they may call it 8.0 to make it clear what version

10:22.020 --> 10:23.020
it is.

10:23.020 --> 10:24.020
Right.

10:24.020 --> 10:25.020
It'll be their first public release.

10:25.020 --> 10:26.020
What do you think?

10:26.020 --> 10:27.580
Yeah, I think that's fair enough.

10:27.580 --> 10:29.660
We're saying three new clones here.

10:29.660 --> 10:32.080
So we're not counting Oracle's one and stuff.

10:32.080 --> 10:36.200
So that's the tricky thing is I'm wondering what qualifies or not.

10:36.200 --> 10:44.100
And I'm thinking it's three rocky rocky Linux or what a rocky OS that would count.

10:44.100 --> 10:47.820
But I'm like a restart of scientific Linux I think would count.

10:47.820 --> 10:52.260
But I don't think cloud Linux counts or Oracle because they've already been shipping for

10:52.260 --> 10:53.780
a while now.

10:53.780 --> 10:55.100
So I'm saying three clones.

10:55.100 --> 10:59.020
OK, so some at least seems like some new clones would need to be well one new clone by my

10:59.020 --> 11:00.020
count at the moment.

11:00.020 --> 11:01.780
But I'm not, you know, somewhere in the mix.

11:01.780 --> 11:06.860
The thing is, the reason why I think this is a little tiny bit risky is these are supposed

11:06.860 --> 11:08.380
to be enterprise distros.

11:08.380 --> 11:14.640
And so going slow and getting it just right is sort of in their nature.

11:14.640 --> 11:19.140
And so it may be too aggressive of a window to say maybe they don't actually ship something

11:19.140 --> 11:20.820
until 2022.

11:20.820 --> 11:26.460
Maybe they don't actually even ship something until I don't I don't know, December.

11:26.460 --> 11:28.060
I mean, that would be my idea.

11:28.060 --> 11:31.820
Here's where my background on this was is they got to get something shipped by December,

11:31.820 --> 11:32.820
right?

11:32.820 --> 11:38.360
Because in December, the end of December 2021, that's when traditional CentOS upgrades, updates

11:38.360 --> 11:39.360
go away.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.900
That's when support dies for CentOS as people knew it.

11:42.900 --> 11:45.740
And people either need to switch to stream, which I think is what the majority of people

11:45.740 --> 11:50.140
will need to do, or they'll have to come to some sort of decision where they do one of

11:50.140 --> 11:54.480
these conversion scripts and convert to some fly-by-night distro.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.040
But I think that's your target.

11:56.040 --> 12:00.020
If you miss that December window, you're going to miss the majority of the market, right?

12:00.020 --> 12:02.720
That's when you need to be ready with something that people could, in theory, actually switch

12:02.720 --> 12:03.720
to.

12:03.720 --> 12:07.600
And that's my prediction is that three of them will be at their production-ready state

12:07.600 --> 12:08.600
by then.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.680
By this time next year, basically.

12:11.680 --> 12:12.680
Right now as we're recording.

12:12.680 --> 12:13.680
Interesting.

12:13.680 --> 12:14.680
All right.

12:14.680 --> 12:15.680
What's your next one then, Wes?

12:15.680 --> 12:18.980
Well, I suppose I'm keeping in the theme of maybe not that likely.

12:18.980 --> 12:21.040
I'm doing it anyway.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.040
Ubuntu ships Systemd HomeD.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.600
Now not Fedora, but Ubuntu here?

12:26.600 --> 12:29.040
Well, Fedora felt almost too certain.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.040
That's just going to happen, right?

12:30.040 --> 12:32.400
At some point, it's going to end up in a Fedora release.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.000
Maybe not the default, but there.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.520
So I think maybe by the next, what, the one in 2104, Systemd HomeD will be available.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.000
You can try it out pretty easily on Ubuntu.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.800
And then by the fall 2110, it'll be online by default.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.800
That's what I'm predicting.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.400
Now, it might not be that they've engaged all the features.

12:50.400 --> 12:54.520
It doesn't have to use all of it or radically change, but just that it's there and it's

12:54.520 --> 12:58.040
running by default in a regular Ubuntu desktop install.

12:58.040 --> 13:03.400
So could we say the key qualifier is if the user account exists when the home folder exists,

13:03.400 --> 13:04.880
that's using Systemd HomeD?

13:04.880 --> 13:05.880
Yeah.

13:05.880 --> 13:09.040
And you've got that part of the distribution of Systemd installed.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.040
Okay.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.040
Just installed?

13:11.040 --> 13:12.040
Yeah.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.520
Installed and configured on the system by default.

13:13.520 --> 13:14.520
Okay.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.520
Hmm.

13:15.520 --> 13:16.520
Hmm.

13:16.520 --> 13:17.520
Yeah.

13:17.520 --> 13:22.120
So if I were canonical, maybe I'd want to claim a little recognition for being willing

13:22.120 --> 13:23.780
to do a little more cutting edge.

13:23.780 --> 13:27.800
And so maybe this is something they'd seriously look into and maybe try to figure out if it's

13:27.800 --> 13:30.000
shippable before they do the LTS.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
That's exactly right.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
That would be the time.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.120
Get it in there before the 2204 LTS that's coming up.

13:35.120 --> 13:36.120
Yeah.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.120
And they could always pull it.

13:37.120 --> 13:42.860
They could put it in 2110 and then if it doesn't work out, pull it and go back to regular home

13:42.860 --> 13:44.360
directory for 2204.

13:44.360 --> 13:45.360
Yeah.

13:45.360 --> 13:46.360
Yeah.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.880
I like this one, actually.

13:47.880 --> 13:48.880
I would like to see it.

13:48.880 --> 13:51.880
It's neat and I'd like to do a little more playing with Systemd HomeD, honestly.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.680
I'm going to save an Ubuntu prediction for Linux Unplugged.

13:54.680 --> 13:56.640
I got one that I'm setting aside.

13:56.640 --> 14:01.440
I feel like I'm going to save it because I want you to have that space in this.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.520
So you'll be the one making the Ubuntu prediction in this episode.

14:04.520 --> 14:05.920
So what's your other one then, Chris?

14:05.920 --> 14:06.920
All right.

14:06.920 --> 14:12.920
This next one, this one could screw me like the Nouveau driver did because this is one

14:12.920 --> 14:14.800
where I'm reading all the tea leaves.

14:14.800 --> 14:19.640
I'm seeing all of the activity leading up to this year.

14:19.640 --> 14:27.760
And I think, I predict the BcashFS will be mainlined in 2021.

14:27.760 --> 14:33.320
I would really like to see this, a nice high-performance file system, fantastic for NVMe drives and

14:33.320 --> 14:34.640
workstations.

14:34.640 --> 14:38.040
You know, when you don't need everything that ButterFS or ZFS can do, but you still want

14:38.040 --> 14:44.380
a modern high-performance, really awesome, well-designed file system, BcashFS.

14:44.380 --> 14:45.960
And it's getting there.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.600
It's getting there.

14:47.600 --> 14:52.600
But like so many things, that final getting it over the final hump to get it in the kernel

14:52.600 --> 14:54.920
can just take forever, like we saw with WireGuard.

14:54.920 --> 14:55.920
Yes.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.200
I mean, there's a high bar of entry for the kernel and rightfully so.

14:58.200 --> 14:59.200
Yeah.

14:59.200 --> 15:03.280
And they've just did another round of reviews for inclusion in October.

15:03.280 --> 15:10.000
And it's looking like it's on a good trajectory, but it's by far, it's not a sure thing yet.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
It's not a sure bet yet.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.600
I'm almost glad of that, honestly, because with file system development, we don't need

15:14.600 --> 15:15.600
that to be rushed.

15:15.600 --> 15:19.240
Like just take the time, get it right, because I think once it is in the kernel, assuming

15:19.240 --> 15:22.480
it makes it there, that's when people will actually really start trying it out.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.480
You're not going to compile a module of a file system that you might use that you don't

15:25.480 --> 15:27.000
know and isn't trusted.

15:27.000 --> 15:31.040
But once it's blessed and actually available by default, yeah, all right, I'm switching.

15:31.040 --> 15:36.480
There are still, as Kent Overstreet puts it, the main developer, a few bugs remaining,

15:36.480 --> 15:42.000
including, quote, kernel oopses with Zstandard compression, some of the erasure code not

15:42.000 --> 15:47.040
being quite stable, but pretty much everything else, replication, compression, checksumming,

15:47.040 --> 15:49.720
encryption, all looking really solid.

15:49.720 --> 15:58.040
And another good sign that's helping get BcacheFS over the inclusion hump is a veteran file

15:58.040 --> 16:03.240
system developer, Dave Chyner, has jumped in to help with testing Bcache.

16:03.240 --> 16:08.320
And he's even found a couple of things by throwing it through a dual socket motherboard,

16:08.320 --> 16:12.400
which looks at some of these checksums and does a little bit of different behavior than

16:12.400 --> 16:13.540
everything on one chip.

16:13.540 --> 16:18.800
And he actually uncovered some scalability issues where BcacheFS wasn't quite staying

16:18.800 --> 16:22.960
up to snuff to say something like XFS is currently doing.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.320
And they're working on those things.

16:24.320 --> 16:28.080
And I think probably by summer, they're going to have all that stuff wrapped up.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.080
So I don't know.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.080
I don't know, Wes.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.080
We'll see.

16:31.080 --> 16:32.080
I don't know if it's going to get included then.

16:32.080 --> 16:36.760
But I think by the time we're recording next year, this kind of episode, I really hope

16:36.760 --> 16:39.080
to see BcacheFS in the mainline kernel.

16:39.080 --> 16:43.040
It may not be shipping in distros yet, but it's going to be upstream.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.240
It's going to be mainlined.

16:44.240 --> 16:50.960
My next question then is how long after it gets mainlined before we've switched the studio?

16:50.960 --> 16:54.520
Linux.ting.com is the next generation of Ting Mobile and it's here.

16:54.520 --> 16:59.260
I've been a customer for over eight years and I can tell you there has never been a

16:59.260 --> 17:01.440
better time to try out Ting.

17:01.440 --> 17:05.240
And when you go to linux.ting.com, you get $25 off.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.240
It's now the smarter choice for everybody.

17:07.240 --> 17:10.980
They have unlimited data plans at $45 a month.

17:10.980 --> 17:15.360
Whether you need two gigs or 20 gigs, whatever it might be, there's a perfect Ting plan for

17:15.360 --> 17:16.360
you now.

17:16.360 --> 17:18.300
And they've made some big improvements there.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.300
But no need to worry because that's really it.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.160
The only thing that's changed is just lower monthly phone bills.

17:23.160 --> 17:27.660
You still get access to Ting's award-winning customer service and nationwide LT and 5G.

17:27.660 --> 17:29.020
And you know what else?

17:29.020 --> 17:30.300
No contracts.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.300
No contracts.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.600
No contracts ever.

17:32.600 --> 17:37.940
And now Ting Mobile customers can choose from three different plans based on your data needs.

17:37.940 --> 17:41.560
And you'd be impressed with how much you can get done through the Ting interface.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.760
The dashboard takes care of just about everything you'd ever need.

17:44.760 --> 17:48.280
I don't understand why the rest of the industry doesn't catch up to where Ting's at.

17:48.280 --> 17:51.120
I mean I'm talking about even like porting over and bringing a new device.

17:51.120 --> 17:52.920
You can do it all through the website.

17:52.920 --> 17:55.400
And pretty much any phone will work with Ting.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.740
So just head to linux.ting.com to check your current phone.

17:58.740 --> 17:59.740
You create an account.

17:59.740 --> 18:01.560
You pick the plan that's right for you.

18:01.560 --> 18:05.420
And then like magic, Elves will send you a SIM card that you pop into your phone and

18:05.420 --> 18:08.660
you can activate and you're going in just a few minutes.

18:08.660 --> 18:12.920
And one of the brilliant things about Ting is there's multiple carriers you can choose

18:12.920 --> 18:15.900
from depending on how it works best in your area.

18:15.900 --> 18:19.360
And that also means that if you need to be mobile or you need multiple different carriers

18:19.360 --> 18:23.840
or maybe you need to move, you can always pick and choose what's going to work best

18:23.840 --> 18:25.460
for you.

18:25.460 --> 18:27.940
So go see what it's like to cut your phone bill in half.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.940
It's never been easier with Ting.

18:29.940 --> 18:32.700
So get started by going to linux.ting.com.

18:32.700 --> 18:34.480
This is the next generation of Ting mobile.

18:34.480 --> 18:37.320
It's here and I'm really impressed with what they've managed to do.

18:37.320 --> 18:43.960
And you can get $25 off when you go to linux.ting.com.

18:43.960 --> 18:48.320
Well it wouldn't be a Linux action news predictions episode without some Bitcoin talk.

18:48.320 --> 18:50.920
And boy howdy with all the news this week.

18:50.920 --> 18:51.920
It's more relevant than ever.

18:51.920 --> 18:56.600
Yeah, it's already dropped about $800 since we started recording.

18:56.600 --> 19:00.280
Yeah, oh boy.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.660
This is a tricky one.

19:01.660 --> 19:05.040
So why don't we review what we said would happen and then we're going to talk about

19:05.040 --> 19:10.160
if we can even predict the future because I think that's a conversation in itself.

19:10.160 --> 19:15.240
Joe, you said that it would get to $19,000 as a high.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.880
I said $22,000.

19:16.880 --> 19:20.600
It actually got as high as $24,000.

19:20.600 --> 19:24.840
And it's possible that it could go even higher by the end of the year after we've recorded

19:24.840 --> 19:25.840
this.

19:25.840 --> 19:26.840
That's absolutely true.

19:26.840 --> 19:30.880
For the low end, you predicted it would go as low as $4k.

19:30.880 --> 19:32.560
I predicted $5k.

19:32.560 --> 19:36.720
And it looks like that's about where it was, was $5k, somewhere around there for the 2020

19:36.720 --> 19:37.720
low.

19:37.720 --> 19:38.720
Wow.

19:38.720 --> 19:39.960
Yeah, around March time, it got to about there.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.440
So you were pretty spot on there.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.440
I was close though.

19:42.440 --> 19:47.040
Boy, that, right now looking back at $5,000, that seems like quite a deal.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.680
You know, because you don't have to buy a full Bitcoin.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.280
You just buy however much you can afford.

19:50.280 --> 19:52.480
Yeah, get like a couple hundred bucks worth of Bitcoin.

19:52.480 --> 19:57.080
Back then it was $5,000 and that would have paid off right now at this point in time.

19:57.080 --> 19:58.760
Not any kind of advice, of course.

19:58.760 --> 20:03.960
I'm just looking at that thinking maybe I should have done something there.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.600
Then we said, okay, here's what it's going to be on December 1st, 2020.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.480
Joe, you said it'd be $7k.

20:08.480 --> 20:10.620
I said it'd be $14k.

20:10.620 --> 20:13.240
It actually turned out to be around $19k.

20:13.240 --> 20:15.280
So much higher than either one of us were thinking.

20:15.280 --> 20:18.800
And I thought I was going a little high because I thought if the low was $5k and I said it's

20:18.800 --> 20:21.040
going to get all the way up to $14k, I was like, well, that's pretty big growth.

20:21.040 --> 20:22.040
Right.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.920
Is it big growth or is it more of a sustained?

20:23.920 --> 20:24.920
Yeah.

20:24.920 --> 20:28.160
Well, I listened back to that predictions episode and what I was talking about was wanting

20:28.160 --> 20:29.160
stability.

20:29.160 --> 20:32.680
I didn't want it to have this massive high.

20:32.680 --> 20:38.400
I thought that if it dropped to about four or five and then crept its way up to seven,

20:38.400 --> 20:41.800
seven and a half, that's what I would want to happen.

20:41.800 --> 20:46.400
I want just slow and steady growth, not this crazy up and down.

20:46.400 --> 20:53.400
But here we are talking about it at $23,000, $24,000, having beaten last year's record

20:53.400 --> 20:58.680
and crucially that $20,000 barrier because it came close earlier in the year to $20,000

20:58.680 --> 21:00.700
and just didn't quite make it.

21:00.700 --> 21:03.540
And that's a psychological barrier to people.

21:03.540 --> 21:06.800
And I kind of didn't want it to break that yet.

21:06.800 --> 21:13.960
I wanted it to have a sustained period of being around about $20,000 and then for it

21:13.960 --> 21:18.000
to break through and then start climbing.

21:18.000 --> 21:24.040
The volatility is going to be its undoing and ultimately will be the undoing of its

21:24.040 --> 21:25.580
value, I think.

21:25.580 --> 21:31.180
It's hard to say because I don't really know how to really predict a currency that has

21:31.180 --> 21:38.320
a limited supply and because people are losing their coins and their wallets.

21:38.320 --> 21:42.440
There's always less and less bitcoins and there will only be a finite amount ever made.

21:42.440 --> 21:46.400
So while new ones are getting mined, there's also ones that are getting lost and there's

21:46.400 --> 21:47.400
a limit on that.

21:47.400 --> 21:51.560
So I do wonder if that doesn't play strange things with the value as well.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.560
Yeah.

21:52.560 --> 21:56.200
I mean, it seems like it's ripe for speculation and people are happy to do that.

21:56.200 --> 22:01.200
And what we noticed is it just took off again like a rocket.

22:01.200 --> 22:06.520
It was bouncing around, bouncing around and then boom, $19,000, tipped to $20,000, came

22:06.520 --> 22:12.320
down a bit and then bam, all the way up to $24,000 as of this morning.

22:12.320 --> 22:17.920
And as we record, it's $23,799.80.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.960
Not that I'm checking, but it's still, it's crazy.

22:20.960 --> 22:21.960
It's still crazy.

22:21.960 --> 22:28.600
But I have noticed a huge shift in how many normals know about Bitcoin.

22:28.600 --> 22:31.240
Everyone in my family knows that Bitcoin is a thing.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.160
They might not understand it.

22:33.160 --> 22:38.940
But there was, I think, a large adoption of Coinbase and then the Cash App made it really

22:38.940 --> 22:39.940
easy to buy Bitcoin.

22:39.940 --> 22:40.940
Right.

22:40.940 --> 22:44.280
It's in the hands of folks, so you might not understand anything about how digital wallets

22:44.280 --> 22:48.360
work or blockchain, but hey, here's something you can buy.

22:48.360 --> 22:53.280
I had the Cash App set up already so I could, you know, hey, here's my half a lunch or whatever.

22:53.280 --> 22:57.020
Like I've used it, I've used it for all kinds of like quick little ways to send money.

22:57.020 --> 22:58.580
So I had everything plumbed already.

22:58.580 --> 23:03.120
And when they rolled out Bitcoin support, it was just a button on my phone now to buy

23:03.120 --> 23:04.120
some Bitcoin.

23:04.120 --> 23:08.360
I actually haven't used it, but I bet a lot of other people have and you're sitting there,

23:08.360 --> 23:12.000
you're watching this thing go up, you buy a little bit of it.

23:12.000 --> 23:16.240
And I think making it easier every step of the way has accelerated adoption and made

23:16.240 --> 23:19.840
it understandable to some degree by the normals.

23:19.840 --> 23:24.880
I told this story on air before, but I actually got a telegram from my mom about a month ago

23:24.880 --> 23:30.060
asking me what I thought about investing in Bitcoin and talking to me about Bitcoin.

23:30.060 --> 23:34.360
My mom, who I've never had a conversation with about Bitcoin before, she found it on

23:34.360 --> 23:40.240
her own and I mean, that really to me was a sign that I kind of feel like I feel like

23:40.240 --> 23:41.460
it's impossible to predict.

23:41.460 --> 23:45.800
But I think it's I think this year it's stuck.

23:45.800 --> 23:46.800
It's here now.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.000
It's sticking around.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.180
I think people who actually speculate on commodities like gold and silver are now keeping.

23:53.180 --> 23:56.360
I mean, I hear this all the time on the economics YouTube channels I watch.

23:56.360 --> 23:59.320
Oh, I have about five percent of my portfolio in crypto.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.800
It's just a new way to diversify your account.

24:01.800 --> 24:05.140
Doesn't seem like we're really using it to actually buy that many products or services

24:05.140 --> 24:06.140
these days.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.560
At least I haven't seen that much of it.

24:07.560 --> 24:08.900
I mean, there's some, right?

24:08.900 --> 24:09.900
It still exists.

24:09.900 --> 24:13.880
But yeah, it seems now more it's a new investment vehicle side hustle.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.020
So how do you predict something like this?

24:16.020 --> 24:17.360
Can you predict something?

24:17.360 --> 24:19.840
You make wild guesses and see what sticks.

24:19.840 --> 24:23.600
Because if you look at the volatility we just saw in the last couple of months, we could

24:23.600 --> 24:28.600
stay this exact price all year long and then in November it could jump up to forty thousand.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.140
I mean, it's just it's wild.

24:30.140 --> 24:33.760
But I do think once twenty thousand was crossed.

24:33.760 --> 24:37.840
Because I think every time what you're doing is you're setting a new expectation of what

24:37.840 --> 24:40.920
Bitcoin's value is because it's all made up anyway.

24:40.920 --> 24:41.920
Right.

24:41.920 --> 24:44.320
And once you get used to that idea, then you're more comfortable paying that for it.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.020
And that's part of how that gets established.

24:46.020 --> 24:49.620
And the longer it stays at these higher prices, the more that becomes the new floor.

24:49.620 --> 24:52.720
Like it just never goes below a certain amount now.

24:52.720 --> 24:57.180
And it ultimately ends up higher than where it, you know, so when it crashes, it usually

24:57.180 --> 24:59.800
rebounds over time higher than when it originally crashed.

24:59.800 --> 25:05.680
So I can't make a prediction here, but I feel like we're going to look back at twenty four

25:05.680 --> 25:06.680
thousand.

25:06.680 --> 25:07.680
I think it was quaint.

25:07.680 --> 25:10.400
I guess you're telling us to buy.

25:10.400 --> 25:14.640
I just think it's reached that point where it's not going away.

25:14.640 --> 25:18.320
It's nature, the block chain, the fact that it's open source, the fact that there's all

25:18.320 --> 25:20.980
these applications being built on top of it.

25:20.980 --> 25:25.480
And now that it's so commonly known, it's becoming easier and more accessible for the

25:25.480 --> 25:26.480
normals.

25:26.480 --> 25:33.040
Yeah, I think it's unless unless a government like the size of the United States just decided

25:33.040 --> 25:34.760
to try to shut it down as much as possible.

25:34.760 --> 25:35.760
It's not going away.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.040
You're right.

25:37.040 --> 25:40.600
People aren't buying goods with it, but a lot of people are also storing silver.

25:40.600 --> 25:45.080
And you think about when people buy gold and silver, some of them are not even actually

25:45.080 --> 25:47.640
they don't actually own the metal, right?

25:47.640 --> 25:51.400
They're buying rights to the metal that's stored somewhere else, right?

25:51.400 --> 25:52.400
What's the difference?

25:52.400 --> 25:56.520
At least one can be cryptographically proven.

25:56.520 --> 26:01.640
Well, I started to get people asking me about this when it was approaching 20,000 again.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.040
And should I buy or not?

26:03.040 --> 26:08.200
And my advice to anyone would always be only invest what you can afford to lose.

26:08.200 --> 26:11.480
And this is a long term investment if you are going to do it.

26:11.480 --> 26:19.800
But I said to them, back in late November, early December, if it breaks the 20,000 barrier,

26:19.800 --> 26:22.080
then it's going to go to the moon, essentially.

26:22.080 --> 26:27.500
If we can break that psychological barrier, which we now have, and we're at 23, 24 ish,

26:27.500 --> 26:30.820
I think it's going to go a lot higher over the next year.

26:30.820 --> 26:37.520
So if you've got money to lose and to risk and to bet, essentially, then you could do

26:37.520 --> 26:38.520
worse, I think.

26:38.520 --> 26:43.240
