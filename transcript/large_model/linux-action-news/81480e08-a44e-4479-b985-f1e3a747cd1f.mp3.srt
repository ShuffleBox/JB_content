00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:22,000
This is episode 93, recorded on February 17th, 2019. I'm Chris.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,180
Hello, Joe. It's good to be connected with you. And I'm looking over the news this week.

5
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,040
And I say we start with the story we all saw coming, especially if you followed the Google

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,360
News recently, and maybe even got yourself one of those Google Home Hubs, you knew this

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,360
was coming.

8
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,200
Yeah, Android Things is no longer going to be about actual Internet of Things. It's going

9
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:49,640
to pivot to be more about smart speakers and displays, which I suppose technically are

10
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,480
Internet of Things devices, but not exactly what we thought when Google announced this.

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,560
No, if you remember, I think it was 2015's IO, where Google announced the Android of

12
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,760
Things platform, a versatile embedded and open source operating system designed to run

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,040
on low power and low memory systems.

14
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,060
Now today, it's essentially still that same operating system, but with a particular focus.

15
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,800
Google announced they're going to transform the Android of Things from a public developer

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:27,320
platform to a, quote, platform for their OEM partners, end quote, to develop things like

17
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,720
smart speakers and smart displays. As a result, moving forward, it won't support production

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,760
systems on modules, which the industry calls SOMs, which are very common systems that are

19
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,080
based around a Qualcomm chipset or maybe a MediaTek hardware. It won't support those.

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,120
Instead, it's more for custom development systems for custom smart screens and custom

21
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,960
smart speakers, which is really another way of saying it's a dedicated OS for the Google

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
Assistant.

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Yeah, although they are going to keep supporting the Raspberry Pi, which I think is just a

24
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,000
safe face more than anything.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,680
This feels like half an announcement because there is the whole like all the other devices

26
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:12,320
in the entire IoT ecosystem that don't have an operating system answer that we don't have

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,020
right now. If you just got one of those Google Home Hubs with a seven inch screen and a nice

28
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,760
huge white bezel, I picked one up. I wanted to try it out.

29
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,800
That's running the Chromecast OS, which is originally based on Gentoo. That's what's

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,340
on these devices. These newer devices aren't even using Android things. They're using Google's

31
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,720
Chromecast platform. And I think it might not only just be a comment on their long term

32
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:42,940
commitment to Android, but perhaps it's an admission that if you're working with this

33
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,640
kind of constrained environment, a more closer to the metal platform is appropriate.

34
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,560
Well, yeah, instead of Android, which is just huge and bloated, why not use proper GNU slash

35
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,680
Linux, which is essentially what they're going to go for or even something completely different

36
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,240
like future, which we think of as a phone OS, but might well end up being more suited

37
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,640
to Internet of Things devices.

38
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,640
Perhaps it's like there is some looming announcement just in the near future that we're waiting

39
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
for.

40
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,320
Yeah, it does very much feel like that. And it's something we're definitely going to have

41
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,600
to keep an eye on. And something that I've been keeping an eye on for a while now are

42
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,320
these Windows 10 ARM laptops. And from the moment they were announced, I wondered, will

43
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,560
you be able to run proper Linux on them? And it turns out that at least on some of them

44
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,520
now you can with a bit of an asterisk.

45
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:39,760
All right, so we're talking three machines, essentially, right now, the ASUS NovaGo, the

46
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,760
HBMV X2, and Lenovo Meeks? Mix? 630? How do you say that one?

47
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
Meeks, I think.

48
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,080
Meeks? Okay. Yeah, so you've got like three systems right now. And then in there, there's

49
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,540
a couple of different sets of supported hardware. It's a little touch and go. For example, as

50
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,920
of February 19th, none of the computers support the following features when you're running

51
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:09,880
Ubuntu. Wi-Fi, hardware accelerated graphics, or access to onboard storage. So it's early

52
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:16,600
days right now. But the folks behind the ARCH64 laptops open source project on GitHub have

53
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:24,260
come up with a way to install Ubuntu 1804 LTS on some of these Windows 10 ARM laptops.

54
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,400
And big picture, this is very important. Just like you want to know if you can go into a

55
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,040
store and maybe pick up a couple of different x86 laptops that can run Linux, you want to

56
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,160
make sure that you can pick up a couple of different ARM laptops.

57
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,160
You know, this reminds me of the whole kerfuffle about Secure Boot. And when that first was

58
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,560
introduced and everyone was panicking, oh, you're not going to be able to run Linux on

59
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:53,680
laptops anymore. And now, as Microsoft kind of moves over to ARM for their consumer devices,

60
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,640
that was my first thought, oh, are we going to be able to run Linux on them? And that's

61
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,920
why I think this is important. It's very early, as you said, and they're not particularly

62
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,940
useful at the moment. But the fact that we are actually, as a Linux community, making

63
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,080
some strides to make Linux work on them, I think that's a real important step and a really

64
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,080
important thing.

65
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:18,560
I cannot agree more with any of that. I feel like we got really, really, really close where

66
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,720
you could buy a ThinkPad laptop, and for the most part, you would be able to run Linux

67
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,080
on it. You could go into a store and you could buy a Dell laptop if they sell in there, and

68
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,320
for the most part, you could run Linux on it, or even an HP laptop.

69
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,600
Yeah, I was going to say even the cheap ones, you can just go into a computer store, and

70
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:40,480
if it's only Intel graphics, the chances are maybe the Wi-Fi card might not work, but otherwise,

71
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
it's going to work fine.

72
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,440
Right. That was it. It was once everything kind of got standardized around the Intel

73
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,600
stuff, you had a pretty good shot that Linux was going to work just fine on it. And it

74
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,280
was going to just be the edge cases around the video and maybe the Wi-Fi. And we sort

75
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,360
of hit the reset button with these ARM machines, and there's a lot of compelling market reasons

76
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,420
to go with ARM. Most consumers don't need the power that an i5, an i7, or maybe even

77
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:12,560
an i3 processor brings them. Most consumers are perfectly happy just browsing the web

78
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,240
with something that an ARM processor can provide and also bring them maybe 10 hours of battery

79
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,240
life.

80
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,720
As ever, Windows is inevitably going to come with Windows problems, and to have that life

81
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,840
boat of being able to install Linux on it, I think is great, and it potentially brings

82
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,040
people into our community in the first place. How often have people thought that their machine

83
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,320
was broken because Windows had slowed down to the point where it was unusable, and then

84
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,000
you install Ubuntu or Mint or whatever, Fedora on there, and suddenly they feel like they've

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,640
got a new laptop. I'm sure that a lot of people listening to this have converted people, whereas

86
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,640
if they've got these ARM machines that up until now has been impossible to install Linux

87
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,040
on, then they're just stuck with Windows.

88
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:01,660
Right. And as the IT guy for the whole family, basically, I love the idea of having a few

89
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,320
solid vendors to recommend. Like, hey, when you go to Costco, why don't you pick up the

90
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,960
HP MVX3 or 5 or whatever it is at some point in the future, go grab that machine, and then

91
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,120
the next time I'm out there, I'll load Ubuntu MATE on there, and you'll have a perfectly

92
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,620
fast secure environment where you can go browse Facebook or you can go browse Twitter and go

93
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,840
be vain or whatever it is.

94
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:31,200
At the end of the day, I love the possibilities here because there's such a great argument

95
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:36,640
to be made for ARM on a laptop like this for people that don't need to edit video or whatever

96
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,000
it might be. They just simply need a system that can browse the web, have great battery

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,520
life and run a secure operating system. And that's the number one argument I go to my

98
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,000
family with for a system like this, is I can get you something that runs great, runs all

99
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,320
the things you need. And in the past, it was maybe Firefox and I'd say, well, we're going

100
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,000
to switch it to LibreOffice or maybe you can use Google Docs or even Office 365. But those

101
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,520
things are beginning to shift now. Now it's, well, yeah, you can totally Facebook still.

102
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,840
Yeah, Twitter, Instagram, you can go read all of those things or go view all of those

103
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:19,200
things on this Linux system. In a big way, it's the argument we used to have in the past.

104
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:26,640
Get people on Windows to run open source applications like Firefox, like LibreOffice or GIMP. And

105
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:33,080
then when they make that migration, they make that switch to Linux, when they choose Linux,

106
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,040
these applications they'll end up using will be the exact applications they were using

107
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,160
on Windows. All of this is in play now, but it's at the hardware level. It's something

108
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:48,240
they can go buy at the Best Buy or whatever local electronic store. I think it's a great

109
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,880
continuation of that perfect value for Linux. And maybe, at least for people like me who

110
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,600
do tech support, once they get Wi-Fi, once they get Bluetooth, it'll be the perfect solution.

111
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,760
Nice subliminal message in there with the choose Linux plug. Well done. But people will

112
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,560
definitely be screaming at their headphones, but what about Chrome OS? Well, Chrome OS

113
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,480
is basically what you've described there, but it's got the proprietary Google stuff

114
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,420
in it. And wouldn't it be nicer for people to have something that performs as well as

115
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:22,740
Chrome OS on an ARM device, but that is propaganda slash Linux and respects their freedom?

116
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,480
It's capitalism, Joe. It's capitalism. You've got all of these companies out there, Dell,

117
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,360
HP, et cetera, et cetera, Asus. They still want to make products and they still want

118
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,000
to sell them to consumers. They need something to power that. And Chrome OS will get a niche,

119
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,200
a niche of their base, but they need to sell to more people than that. And I think that's

120
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,000
where this has a much larger role.

121
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,040
Well that's all for the future, but if you're stuck on Windows right now, then you might

122
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,280
well be using the Windows subsystem for Linux. And if you are, then you should definitely,

123
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,400
definitely not disable your antivirus.

124
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,840
At least according to a Microsoft developer who is involved in their antivirus program,

125
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,440
which they have invested a lot of time and money into. I have to be honest, if I'm ever

126
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,100
on a Windows system, I do not run antivirus. Maybe on Windows 10 I do because it's turned

127
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,120
on by default it sounds like. But people are looking for a solution to the disk I.O. issues

128
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,960
with the Windows subsystem. The main performance shortcoming for the Windows subsystem for

129
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:30,480
Linux has been in the area of disk I.O. The CPU and system benchmarks that Ferronix has

130
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,380
done routinely show us that the Windows 10 subsystem for Linux with Ubuntu and other

131
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:42,120
distributions does actually perform quite well. But when it comes to the area of disk

132
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,180
writes and reads, it is dramatically slower than the bare metal Linux installations that

133
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,640
Michael compares it to. Disabling the Windows Defender or other antivirus systems that might

134
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,880
be on your Windows box kind of fixes it, but it's not a hundred percent fix.

135
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,240
What I've seen reports of up to five times the disk I.O. performance just by disabling

136
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:10,920
antivirus. But I've also seen reports of NPM dependencies being flagged as malware, which

137
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:18,480
I assume are correct. So I'm conflicted about what I would advise someone on this.

138
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,160
Yeah. And I find this whole story really interesting because it's exposing a fundamental flaw

139
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,320
with the Windows subsystem for Linux, and that is the Windows disk I.O. system. It's

140
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,240
horribly slow. And the fact that the Windows Defender impacts that even a little bit is

141
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:41,280
pretty remarkable here because if you zoom out and read what the story is, it is Microsoft

142
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:47,780
warning you, dear user of Windows, that open source is so dangerous. You could have installed

143
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,800
something from maybe the node.js repository that would have given you some malware. It

144
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,080
would have tried to mine some Monero. And it is so dangerous that you need to run the

145
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:03,720
Windows subsystem for Linux. We make Linux safer. Even if it makes it 10 to 15 percent

146
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,680
slower, we make Linux safer. In fact, Rich Turner of Microsoft issued a fresh warning

147
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,200
on not disabling Windows Defender, even for the Windows subsystem for Linux. In fact,

148
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:20,200
he pleads with you not to exclude your Linux directories because as of the I.O. performance

149
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:26,240
coming short, Rich says we're working across several teams right now to figure out an effective

150
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,520
solution for the performance issue, despite the performance impact. In the meantime, we

151
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,280
recommend patience. So despite the performance impact, they're working on the performance

152
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,760
impact. Just need patience, Joe. Just need patience.

153
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,040
But you can't trust the open source software. Anyone can write stuff for it and anyone can

154
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,240
read it as well. Definitely don't want to trust that. It does feel like old Microsoft,

155
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,440
this, doesn't it? And, you know, we said before that Microsoft is not one thing. It is a big

156
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,320
umbrella of many different departments. And there are tons of people working over there

157
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,480
who really believe in software freedom or at least open source. And even if that's just

158
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,960
for the pragmatic reasons. But then there are clearly some people who have that old

159
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:17,120
opinion who believe that the proprietary way of doing things is better. And I have never

160
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,740
ever once used antivirus on Linux. Supposedly, it's good to use if you interact with people

161
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:28,800
on Windows and you don't want to kind of forward Windows malware onto them. But I think if

162
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,280
you're running Windows and your malware detection doesn't catch it, well, that's your fault,

163
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:39,040
not mine. I don't know. Is that, is it too much ivory tower thinking of me there to not

164
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,800
worry about malware protection on the next? My response to that is that it's a big old.

165
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,520
It depends. Like if you're if you're working on your workstation where you're developing

166
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:53,320
your application, that's one thing. If you're deploying on a server, that's a whole other

167
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,280
thing. Like there's a place for anti-malware on a server, but you better not be depending

168
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,400
on a Windows defender to protect your server. One thing that I did note in these release

169
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,520
notes here is that they've enabled now the ability to browse your Windows subsystem for

170
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,080
Linux file system from Explorer. Essentially, you fire up bash, you go to the directory

171
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,880
that you want to browse, and then you launch explore.exe in that directory. That's not

172
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,400
the interesting part. The interesting part is how Microsoft is pulling this magic trick

173
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:29,200
off. They're using the 9P protocol. You know, I know what you're thinking. Chris, what's

174
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,920
that? What's the 9P protocol? It's a network protocol developed for the Plan 9 system from

175
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,800
Bell Labs way, way back in the day. And they're using that now to facilitate file requests

176
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,200
from Windows to the Linux subsystem. They say they've modified the Windows subsystem

177
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:53,320
for Linux at NIT daemon to include the 9P server. The server contains protocols that

178
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,280
support the Linux metadata, including permissions, which is not a one to one translation to what

179
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:05,480
Windows NTFS permissions are. There is a Windows service and a driver that acts as a client

180
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:13,040
and talks to the 9P server, which is running as its own Windows subsystem for Linux instance.

181
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,560
The client and server communicate over AF Unix sockets. And since Windows subsystem

182
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,960
for Linux allows interops between a Windows application and a Linux application using

183
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:29,840
AF Unix sockets, it all works. As of right now, the files are only accessible when the

184
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:34,400
distro is running. So you have to have the Windows subsystem for Linux up and going and

185
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:41,640
accessing the Linux files is treated as the same as accessing a network resource. So it's

186
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:48,640
the same backslash, backslash, Windows subsystem for Linux. So it's WSL dollar sign Ubuntu

187
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,880
or whatever the name of your system is. And then you get into the file system. So any

188
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,840
limitations or rules for when you're accessing a network file system in Explorer will apply

189
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,480
to accessing the Windows subsystem for Linux files. So there's some trade offs there, but

190
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,680
it's, it's pretty cool. You know, reading about all of this made me think that the subsystem

191
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:18,680
is either this amazingly architected and put together system, or it is the biggest ugliest

192
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,680
hack in history.

193
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:26,960
Either way, it shows you that the Windows disk IO system is not nearly as cool as Linux.

194
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,800
Yeah, we know that much. Well, enough Microsoft talk. Let's get down to some serious enterprise

195
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:39,880
Linux. And Red Hat satellite is going to standardize on Postgres, and unsurprisingly, drop MongoDB.

196
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,240
This is a fascinating story from a lot of different angles. But when you look at it,

197
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:53,160
it's been in motion since mid 2016. In mid 2016, in fact, around September, there is

198
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,840
an upstream change with the pulp project, which is really kind of responsible for the

199
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:04,560
repository management aspects of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and the whole satellite server. In 2016,

200
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:09,680
on September 13, they're on their mailing list, they're writing about moving their backend

201
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:17,840
from MongoDB to Postgres. So Red Hat's known this is coming since September of 2016. Now

202
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:24,320
I believe this accelerated in January when Red Hat began to distance themselves from

203
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,400
the MongoDB project. On their blog, they continue to say the reasons for the directions that

204
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,280
we are going there is we feel that Postgres is a better solution for the types of data

205
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,360
and the usage that satellite requires. Well, you know, that's very true. And in the past,

206
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,020
they were kind of using a mixed scenario. When I originally deployed Red Hat satellite,

207
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:51,080
it was, I believe, if memory serves, using the Oracle database. So that was a really

208
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,640
long time ago. And now they've kind of been in this hybrid situation where there's some

209
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,600
Postgres and there's some MongoDB. But with pulp going over to Postgres, it just seems

210
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,360
like Red Hat didn't really have any choice. And they eventually were going to have to

211
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,800
make this change. And the MongoDB relicensing just sort of facilitated the need here.

212
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,440
Yeah, so it's not black and white here. It's not just because of that change to the server

213
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,240
side public license. There are strong technical reasons for this, but it was probably something

214
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,960
that may have taken a bit longer if it weren't for that move and it weren't for them basically

215
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,440
having to drop MongoDB.

216
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,960
Yeah, I think that's basically it. But this is all in the context of Amazon launching

217
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:40,080
AWS DocumentDB and DigitalOcean launching their own fully managed hosted Postgres.

218
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,680
Yeah, it's not a great time for MongoDB anymore, is it? It seems that Postgres is winning.

219
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:53,400
Now DigitalOcean, they're not quite up there with AWS and Azure and Google Cloud, but they

220
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,800
certainly want to be, don't they? And introducing something like this really puts a stake in

221
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:04,160
the ground of saying, we are a serious player in this cloud market. We're not just $5 droplets

222
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,560
for people wanting to mess around with Nextcloud.

223
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,720
No, they're pitching this as a totally managed database solution, not a Postgres database

224
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,120
solution, but managed database. Now they say they're starting with Postgres, but managed

225
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,400
database enables developers of all skill levels to quickly and easily spin up a performance

226
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:28,920
database cluster. And I like this hook here. Get ready for this. Best of all, you don't

227
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:35,880
need to know anything about Linux or specific DevOps maintenance tasks. And now apparently

228
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,360
they're in a position now where they can sell entire hosted database services that are hassle-free.

229
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,280
And they write, a significant advantage to a managed database is saving time, lots of

230
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,160
time. You can quickly deploy a database and we'll handle the rest. Never worry again about

231
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,760
security patches to the OS or the database engine. Once a new version or a patch is available,

232
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,400
simply click a button and enable it. I don't know, Joe, the old sysadmin in me is dying

233
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
a little bit today.

234
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,080
Well, we had a big discussion about this on Late Night Linux a couple of episodes ago

235
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:13,400
and I came to the conclusion that it can be a good thing to use managed databases and

236
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,920
effectively lock yourself into certain cloud providers as long as you're not completely

237
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:23,560
dependent on them. And I think that for DigitalOcean to grow and to continue to compete in the

238
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,680
market, they have to do stuff like this.

239
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:30,780
I kind of think it's a positive overall for open source because DigitalOcean writes about

240
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:37,640
adding Redis and MySQL down the road. And that is great because we're not talking about

241
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,360
the DigitalOcean database service. We're talking about Postgres. We're talking about Redis.

242
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,060
So this is like move your data anywhere kind of stuff. And this is where the cloud needs

243
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,060
to go.

244
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:56,880
And I hope that it pushes Azure and it pushes AWS to stay mainline as much as possible with

245
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,080
upstream open source projects because data portability I think is going to be the absolute

246
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,120
key when people move all of their workloads to the cloud. And DigitalOcean is essentially

247
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:13,020
just offering a fully managed Postgres or MySQL installation where they do the patches,

248
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,560
they do the upgrades, they provide all the backend stuff, but you're just using standard

249
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,760
stuff here as a developer. And I think that is the way to do it.

250
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,400
Well, I'd be surprised if Redis does actually make it onto DigitalOcean because they've

251
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,280
made similar license changes, although it's not quite as egregious as what MongoDB have

252
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:36,040
done. But I don't know, maybe something like MariaDB might be more likely. But we'll see.

253
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:42,400
From the local section of the news this week, there is some warnings for Void Linux users.

254
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,280
Void is no longer in control of the voidlinux.eu domain.

255
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:52,360
Well, this isn't a huge surprise, is it, given that back in May last year, the original founder

256
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:58,160
of Void went AWOL and presumably took this domain with him. And much like Solus have

257
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,880
done, they've had to switch their domain over. Now they've gone for voidlinux.org, which

258
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,600
kind of makes more sense as a domain to me.

259
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,920
Yeah, absolutely. And they write on this really brief post on their website, they write, at

260
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:15,040
this time, please assume that anything involving voidlinux.eu is not related to Void Linux

261
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:21,000
and should be considered potentially malicious. Well, when I read that, I had to go browse.

262
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,920
I had to go see what it was, Joe. You know what I mean? So I popped in the old browser.

263
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,000
I did a private session because I'm a gentleman. And it's just a domain squatting page. It's

264
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
nothing right now.

265
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,440
Yeah, I was looking for something interesting. But yeah, as you say, someone's bought it

266
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,500
and it's just like coming soon sort of thing.

267
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,320
So stand by. And maybe they'll find it within their hearts to donate it to the Void Linux

268
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,320
project. Wouldn't that be nice?

269
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,760
Well, you never know. Maybe a philanthropist has bought it and is going to give it back

270
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:54,680
to them. But it seems unlikely to me. So in the meantime, yeah, make sure that it's voidlinux.org.

271
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,680
But it does just go to show that with these smaller projects that don't have the governance

272
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:06,200
in place, you can get these serious problems. And we talked about it last year. But it just

273
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,400
turns me off using these smaller distros. And it shouldn't do. And you know, how are

274
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,440
you going to get another big distro if you don't start out small? But I don't know, I'd

275
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,640
just stick to Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch even, you know, well-established projects.

276
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,040
No, I completely follow. You know, it's a tough thing because you want to recommend

277
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,840
something to start with when people are trying out Linux and you feel responsible for that

278
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,440
recommendation. And it is getting harder and harder to recommend those quote unquote, homegrown

279
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,320
boutique Linux distros. Even though sometimes that's where the coolest innovation is happening,

280
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,000
like the neatest thing that's solving that edge case problem happens at those boutique

281
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,080
distro levels. And you want to see that continue. At the same time, you don't want to see a

282
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:59,000
repeat of Corora or Void Linux or Solus. It's kind of getting to the point where I feel

283
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:07,200
like the safest recommendation is mainstream Linux. I recommend big Linux now, Joe, if

284
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
there is such a thing.

285
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,460
Yeah, which is a shame because as you say, things like Void Linux are actually doing

286
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:18,840
something technically very different from the big distros. But do you recommend them

287
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,160
to people? I don't know, the kind of people who you would recommend them to probably are

288
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,960
not going to have a problem migrating off them. You're not going to recommend Void Linux

289
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:35,200
to your grandma, are you? Whereas putting Fedora or Ubuntu on there, or even Debian,

290
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,400
or even something like Manjaro or something, you could imagine, but not something like

291
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:45,040
super technical like Void Linux. So it's probably not that much of a problem, but it's still

292
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,780
something to consider.

293
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:52,520
And while there is a Linux for the rest of us, there's also now a cryptocurrency for

294
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,360
the rest of us, I guess, at least according to JP Morgan.

295
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:02,640
Yeah, JPM coin, which is not a cryptocurrency as we know it. It's not traded openly. It's

296
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,480
what they call a stable coin. So it is backed by JP Morgan to be equivalent to the US dollar

297
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,760
at all times. So it's not going to fluctuate in value. And it's not even open to their

298
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,020
standard customers. It's a few of their corporate customers. So it's not quite as big a deal

299
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:25,760
as some people are making it, but it is nevertheless a huge financial institution getting on board

300
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:31,520
with both blockchain and digital payment technology. And it's them dipping their toe in the water,

301
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,400
but it's still it's kind of like, you know, one small toe dip in the water one giant leap

302
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
for the industry.

303
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:43,840
Yeah, I mean, it is facilitating between institution transfers. So JP Morgan Chase is developing

304
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,920
a new cryptocurrency called the JPM coin, whose value will be tied specifically to the

305
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:56,520
US dollar. And the new cryptocurrency is built on top of the quorum blockchain technology,

306
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:03,200
which is a variant or in other words, a fork of Ethereum, which has been modified to serve

307
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,660
the needs of big banks like JP Morgan specifically. Ethereum's network throughput is limited to

308
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:16,400
roughly 15 to 20 transactions per second. But quorum improves on that by at least as

309
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:24,040
they say, an order of magnitude, comfortably handling hundreds of transactions per second.

310
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,840
And you have to wonder, what's this really about? Because it's not a public blockchain.

311
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,400
So you lose some of the value there. And that's really the big question is how valuable is

312
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:39,760
this without a public ledger. But at the same time, you do gain a mathematically reliable

313
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,720
way to transfer funds. So there is some value here, we just don't really know how far this

314
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,520
is going to go. But it is totally a new breed of cryptocurrency, which is stable because

315
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,440
it's pegged to the dollar and backed by a massive financial institution. I think we

316
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,440
all knew it was going to go this way. But now we actually have it.

317
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:05,040
Well, I for one, welcome this because if it means that when I get paid by an American

318
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:10,680
company, that payment happens immediately, rather than having to wait a day or so for

319
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:16,800
all of the legacy systems to catch up with the fact that a number needs to be subtracted

320
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:23,760
from one bank account and added to another one, then just I welcome this. These big banks

321
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:31,440
need to embrace this technology and get out of the 20th century and into the 21st century

322
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,280
and make payments actually work instantaneously rather than going through all this clearing.

323
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,880
No kidding, I completely agree. And if you strip away all the hype around blockchain

324
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:48,080
and Bitcoin and all of that, and you just say cryptographically verifiable transactions

325
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,840
that can be ledged in a way that is audible by other parties, that's a sellable idea.

326
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,960
You take away all the other stuff around cryptocurrency and you just focus on that aspect of it, banks

327
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,280
are going to love that. Oh, and they also love the fact they didn't have to actually

328
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,640
R&D the whole thing. They can just go fork some open source project and they can get

329
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,520
running. I mean, this would have taken them 20 years to develop and they've done this

330
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,920
in, you know, a matter of no time. So we'll see where it goes. My sense is it starts small

331
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,680
as you know, in little, little, and when I say little, it could be millions of dollars,

332
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,600
but transactions between institutions transferring funds, and then it just grows from there over

333
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
time.

334
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,200
Yeah, I don't think that everyone's going to be using this for mainstream banks this

335
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,480
year is probably five years out, maybe more than that. But it's the foundation for these

336
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,040
old institutions embracing what's essentially just a new database technology.

337
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,480
However, I want to caution something in the audience. It's, it's pretty easy to get

338
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,440
blase about this, and sort of gloss over blockchain news, and it's it's easy to kind of just tune

339
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,160
this all out. But if you zoom out and look at the big picture here, what we are talking

340
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:02,600
about is open source fundamentally affecting the way that massive international financial

341
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:08,700
institutions transfer money around the world. And that's going to be influenced by open

342
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:14,460
source software. Open source is touching every aspect of our lives these days,

343
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:22,320
as it should, because apart from the deep social and political reasons for using free

344
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,240
software and open source, it's just fundamentally a better way to do things. And time and time

345
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,760
again, we're seeing pragmatic uses of open source.

346
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,960
As that world evolves and changes, we will cover it every single week go to Linux at
