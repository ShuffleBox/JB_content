00:00.000 --> 00:08.960
Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 168, recorded on December 20th, 2020.

00:08.960 --> 00:09.960
I'm Chris.

00:09.960 --> 00:10.960
And I'm Wes.

00:10.960 --> 00:11.960
Hello, Wes.

00:11.960 --> 00:14.520
Let's do the news and let's start with a real shocker.

00:14.520 --> 00:17.080
Google is killing another project.

00:17.080 --> 00:20.360
Unfortunately, I can't say I'm surprised.

00:20.360 --> 00:25.720
This time around the dead project is Google's Android Things, a version of Android meant

00:25.720 --> 00:27.920
for the internet of things.

00:27.920 --> 00:32.420
Google announced it had basically given up on the project as a general purpose IoT operating

00:32.420 --> 00:34.520
system back in 2019.

00:34.520 --> 00:39.360
But now there's an official shutdown date thanks to a new FAQ page detailing the demise

00:39.360 --> 00:40.360
of the OS.

00:40.360 --> 00:44.480
Yeah, and with all things in the IoT space, generally these days, it's not just the device

00:44.480 --> 00:49.080
support, there's a service attached as well and the Android Things dashboard, which is

00:49.080 --> 00:55.260
used for managing devices, will stop accepting new devices and projects in just three weeks

00:55.260 --> 00:58.280
on January 5th, 2021.

00:58.280 --> 01:04.260
Developers will be able to continue updating existing deployments until January 5th, 2022.

01:04.260 --> 01:05.660
That's one more year there.

01:05.660 --> 01:10.740
But after that, Google says the console will be turned down completely and all project

01:10.740 --> 01:16.600
data will be permanently deleted, including build configurations and factory images.

01:16.600 --> 01:19.200
So hey, better grab those while you can.

01:19.200 --> 01:20.200
Wow.

01:20.200 --> 01:24.200
For those of you that don't recall, since I don't think this was a hugely successful

01:24.200 --> 01:28.520
product for Google, Android Things was a stripped down version of Google's Phone OS.

01:28.520 --> 01:33.780
It was ideally meant for the Internet of Things, small cheap devices like sensors and smart

01:33.780 --> 01:34.880
home devices.

01:34.880 --> 01:40.480
The idea was that Android would bring a wide hardware compatibility, huge plus for manufacturers

01:40.480 --> 01:45.040
and established app SDK, which they might likely already be writing apps for.

01:45.040 --> 01:50.660
And of course, Google's easy to access cloud platform, along with regular security updates

01:50.660 --> 01:53.140
delivered via that platform.

01:53.140 --> 02:00.840
Google kind of took the Apple strategy for Android Things where they were much more in

02:00.840 --> 02:02.520
control of the updates.

02:02.520 --> 02:06.280
They centrally distributed them, OEM sent them the firmware and the software, Google

02:06.280 --> 02:09.000
massaged them and then deployed them.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.800
IoT admins just had to go log into the dashboard and hit the ship update button on their Android

02:13.800 --> 02:16.600
of Things dashboard, which then Google would send off.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.880
I wonder if maybe this wasn't so surprising because part of the problem with Android Things

02:20.880 --> 02:25.720
was that Android is just really heavy, at least for an embedded operating system.

02:25.720 --> 02:30.520
The phones in our pockets these days are pretty beefy and even then Android's not exactly

02:30.520 --> 02:31.960
snappy.

02:31.960 --> 02:39.040
So while an OS for smartphones can be extended to cars and TVs, it's just bigger, more power

02:39.040 --> 02:40.560
hungry than you really need.

02:40.560 --> 02:44.960
I saw a link to a demo of a sample Android Things app and then compared it to a little

02:44.960 --> 02:49.640
C++ application for targeting an embedded space and the amount of boilerplate, it was

02:49.640 --> 02:51.120
just kind of crazy.

02:51.120 --> 02:55.180
Yeah and you could see it even in semi-nice vehicles that would have built-in Android

02:55.180 --> 02:59.400
integration or televisions that would use it, it would just be really slow.

02:59.400 --> 03:04.660
And I think everyone noticed when Google shipped their own IoT devices on modified versions

03:04.660 --> 03:11.160
of their Google Cast platform instead of Android Things, it was a real indicator that maybe

03:11.160 --> 03:12.160
there's a problem here.

03:12.160 --> 03:16.960
And in a way it was sort of a screw you to Google's OEMs too because groups like Lenovo

03:16.960 --> 03:21.500
would come along and they'd make a Lenovo Smart Display using essentially the Google

03:21.500 --> 03:25.640
Assistant software but running on top of Android Things.

03:25.640 --> 03:30.480
And then Google would come along, undercut them on price and overperform because they

03:30.480 --> 03:35.700
were using their Cast platform which is essentially based off of Gen 2 Linux.

03:35.700 --> 03:40.200
And so I think it was really kind of this awkward situation where even Google found

03:40.200 --> 03:42.680
it not necessarily the most compelling option.

03:42.680 --> 03:48.320
Yeah, there just wasn't that much commitment here and so it was never really adopted.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.120
But there were promises made.

03:50.120 --> 03:55.680
When Android Things launched in May 2018, Google promised free stability fixes and security

03:55.680 --> 03:59.920
patches for three years for every Android Things device.

03:59.920 --> 04:05.240
And it told developers its hardware was certified for production use with guaranteed long-term

04:05.240 --> 04:08.800
support for three years, which is something you might want if you're going to be making

04:08.800 --> 04:10.920
products that ship and live in consumers' homes.

04:10.920 --> 04:14.560
Yeah, or if you're buying them for your factory floor, you want something that's going to

04:14.560 --> 04:17.440
have a guaranteed support lifecycle.

04:17.440 --> 04:21.600
Well, so that put Google on the hook until May of 2021.

04:21.600 --> 04:25.860
But based on the frequently asked questions they posted and the official Android Things

04:25.860 --> 04:30.080
release page, it sounds like Google is not going to honor that promise.

04:30.080 --> 04:36.440
The last Android Things release listed was August of 2019, putting Google's actual update

04:36.440 --> 04:40.740
support at one year and three months.

04:40.740 --> 04:45.880
And since there's no new devices coming, no new projects being accepted to the dashboard,

04:45.880 --> 04:48.120
it seems like that's the end of things.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.520
So long, Android Things.

04:50.520 --> 04:55.680
Unfortunately, the entire Android ecosystem struggles with support life cycles, but that's

04:55.680 --> 04:59.960
why it's kind of interesting to see Google and Qualcomm teaming up to enable a longer

04:59.960 --> 05:03.680
support window for flagship Android smartphones.

05:03.680 --> 05:09.320
Qualcomm, with Google's help, will now support its chipsets for three years of major OS updates

05:09.320 --> 05:15.280
and four years of security updates, enabling a perhaps better than pixel level for all

05:15.280 --> 05:19.440
future Android phones, well, provided your OEM is willing to cooperate.

05:19.440 --> 05:22.900
Yeah, they got to get them nice, fancy Qualcomm chips.

05:22.900 --> 05:28.400
This policy is starting with the flagship Snapdragon 888, but Qualcomm does say even

05:28.400 --> 05:34.800
their lower end chips will be supported down the road, including their, quote, lower tier

05:34.800 --> 05:35.900
ones, end quote.

05:35.900 --> 05:39.920
But they are starting with this new Snapdragon 888 platform.

05:39.920 --> 05:44.320
Part of what makes this so difficult is that there's just a lot of moving pieces and a

05:44.320 --> 05:49.160
lot of different actors involved in Android release and life cycle, right?

05:49.160 --> 05:53.240
I mean, you get your actual OEM that's making the phone, getting their own skin on there,

05:53.240 --> 05:56.560
and then you've got to have support lower down in the stack from people like Qualcomm,

05:56.560 --> 06:00.160
who've got to make sure that all the actual bits and bobs work so you can receive your

06:00.160 --> 06:01.360
text messages.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.840
And drivers for those bits and bobs as the OS updates.

06:03.840 --> 06:04.840
Yeah, absolutely.

06:04.840 --> 06:05.840
Right.

06:05.840 --> 06:09.520
So you've got the open source part of Android and Google's internal workings over at the

06:09.520 --> 06:12.760
Android repository that has to come together.

06:12.760 --> 06:13.760
Qualcomm has to keep up.

06:13.760 --> 06:17.800
And then the OEMs have to integrate all of that before any of it ever gets in your hands.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.920
And that's to say nothing if the carriers get involved with any bits of it.

06:20.920 --> 06:21.920
Let's hope not.

06:21.920 --> 06:22.920
Right.

06:22.920 --> 06:27.840
But practically speaking, this means that Android will be supported on the 888 Snapdragon

06:27.840 --> 06:33.520
with version 11, 12, 13 and 14.

06:33.520 --> 06:34.600
That's remarkable.

06:34.600 --> 06:38.520
So as a consumer, if this is something you care about now, you can start shopping for

06:38.520 --> 06:40.680
these Snapdragons that will be supported like this.

06:40.680 --> 06:45.480
Starting with 888, you'll know you've got until Android 14 with that device.

06:45.480 --> 06:46.480
That's really nice.

06:46.480 --> 06:51.440
Yeah, I really hope this is a sea change eventually for the whole Android ecosystem because it's

06:51.440 --> 06:52.440
just been embarrassing.

06:52.440 --> 06:57.560
You know, you can have a perfectly functional phone, say a Google Pixel 2, works just fine,

06:57.560 --> 07:01.440
no longer supported with updates just for no reason, it feels like.

07:01.440 --> 07:05.140
And especially when that other ecosystem does this a lot better.

07:05.140 --> 07:06.140
That's true.

07:06.140 --> 07:07.140
That's true.

07:07.140 --> 07:10.360
That's why I'm also grateful for projects like Lineage and all the other efforts out

07:10.360 --> 07:14.960
there to get alternative operating systems on some of these devices.

07:14.960 --> 07:19.520
While that's great for free software consumers like ourselves, it doesn't really work for

07:19.520 --> 07:23.000
the average phone buyer who goes into the carrier store and picks up a phone where these

07:23.000 --> 07:26.840
changes actually will improve their quality of life because some of these are security

07:26.840 --> 07:27.840
fixes.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.220
Yes, it's especially nice, I think, for that reason to see it in some of the lower end

07:30.220 --> 07:34.040
models possible, possibly, you know, because I need a phone I can recommend to my mom and

07:34.040 --> 07:35.760
she doesn't want to spend flagship money.

07:35.760 --> 07:41.040
Well, speaking of saving a little money, Neverware was an organization that let you turn an old

07:41.040 --> 07:46.200
PC or Mac into a Chromebook S device through its cloud ready OS.

07:46.200 --> 07:50.040
And it was mostly aimed at schools and enterprises for obvious reasons.

07:50.040 --> 07:54.160
They did make a free home edition that was available to anyone to download for free.

07:54.160 --> 07:59.380
Well, now this week, we find out that Google has acquired Neverware and cloud ready with

07:59.380 --> 08:02.960
plans to integrate it into Chrome OS.

08:02.960 --> 08:07.840
The news was quietly announced by Neverware back on Monday afternoon, and it comes after

08:07.840 --> 08:12.300
Google invested in a Series B funding round three years ago.

08:12.300 --> 08:16.480
For their part, Google says we can confirm that the Neverware team is joining the Google

08:16.480 --> 08:18.300
Chrome OS team.

08:18.300 --> 08:22.500
As we continue to support customers with their transition to the cloud, Neverware has offered

08:22.500 --> 08:27.360
a valuable solution, cloud ready, that allows customers to unlock the manageability, speed

08:27.360 --> 08:30.520
and productivity of a Chrome device.

08:30.520 --> 08:33.880
Following our partnership over the past few years, we're looking forward to working more

08:33.880 --> 08:38.200
closely with the team to support more customers in their transition to deploy Chrome OS.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.560
I bet they are.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.600
And this sounds exactly like it is.

08:41.600 --> 08:46.520
Neverware's cloud ready OS is based on Chromium and they've essentially recreated aspects

08:46.520 --> 08:49.240
of Chrome OS for general PCs.

08:49.240 --> 08:53.120
You could see why maybe schools that already had a fleet of Chromebooks and they could

08:53.120 --> 08:57.600
take old laptops and convert those into Chromebooks and manage them with the same tools.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.320
You can see how that could be a compelling solution.

09:00.320 --> 09:04.520
In their FAQ, they say over the long term, cloud ready will become an official Chrome

09:04.520 --> 09:06.920
OS offering.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.020
That's interesting.

09:08.020 --> 09:12.740
And they say existing customers will be upgraded seamlessly when that happens.

09:12.740 --> 09:13.740
That's also interesting.

09:13.740 --> 09:17.120
That does suggest a high level of integration.

09:17.120 --> 09:22.120
It actually reads to me like Google is going to actually fully incorporate this instead

09:22.120 --> 09:29.320
of just acquire it to perhaps get rid of competition that is taking market from new Chromebooks.

09:29.320 --> 09:32.200
It seems like they have an eye to use this to extend to Chrome OS.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.200
Yeah, that's interesting.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.780
I mean, I think it is hopefully good news in the short term for Neverware users and

09:36.780 --> 09:40.880
that they'll have tighter integration, probably faster updates and sounds like updates that

09:40.880 --> 09:44.500
fall in line more with the official Chrome OS updates and not how Neverware was previously

09:44.500 --> 09:45.780
doing it.

09:45.780 --> 09:51.720
But given our previous story, hopefully nothing changes too soon here.

09:51.720 --> 09:55.200
Yeah, as for their part, Neverware is currently promising there'll be no changes for the free

09:55.200 --> 10:00.560
home edition or other support policies, but we'll be watching.

10:00.560 --> 10:07.560
Chromebooks and Chrome OS in general are just a fascinating story over 2020 and ChromeUnboxed.com

10:07.560 --> 10:13.000
has a hint that there may be native Steam gaming coming to Chromebooks, essentially

10:13.000 --> 10:18.680
by parsing through commits and looking at an Ubuntu based container that's being built

10:18.680 --> 10:21.620
out for Chrome OS.

10:21.620 --> 10:28.000
They are coming to the conclusion that it's not just going to be Stadia or Nvidia game

10:28.000 --> 10:33.720
streaming, but you're actually going to have Chromebooks, perhaps with Ryzen CPU and GPUs

10:33.720 --> 10:37.600
in them very soon that are capable of playing the native video games.

10:37.600 --> 10:38.600
Wow.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.600
It's kind of new territory.

10:39.600 --> 10:44.240
You know, it's from what started as a very limited purpose built OS, suddenly it has

10:44.240 --> 10:47.960
grown a lot of new features, but it makes sense they've invested a lot in the underlying,

10:47.960 --> 10:53.200
you know, crostini technology, the Linux containers under the hood and playing games would be

10:53.200 --> 10:54.200
a great result.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.200
And why not?

10:55.200 --> 10:58.640
If you got the horsepower in there, you got the native Linux OS there, you can put everything

10:58.640 --> 10:59.820
in a container.

10:59.820 --> 11:00.820
Why not do it?

11:00.820 --> 11:02.040
The project is called Borealis.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.940
We'll have a link in the show notes.

11:04.940 --> 11:10.360
We'll see if this actually develops, but right now the rumor has it arriving mid 2021, sort

11:10.360 --> 11:14.320
of soft rolling out as some new hardware lands for Chromebooks.

11:14.320 --> 11:19.080
Maybe one more reason not to get your next Windows box.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.480
Linode.com slash land.

11:20.480 --> 11:24.640
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account and go there to support this

11:24.640 --> 11:25.760
here show.

11:25.760 --> 11:28.320
Linode is our cloud server provider.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.880
I was spending a good chunk of Friday trying out different things.

11:31.880 --> 11:37.360
I ended up with a new Linode that I use as sort of a interstitial cloud box for my sync

11:37.360 --> 11:39.980
thing network slash empire.

11:39.980 --> 11:41.240
What I do is really quite simple.

11:41.240 --> 11:45.400
They set up a Linode $5 box, and if you go there and get our $100 credit, you can play

11:45.400 --> 11:47.120
with something a lot more powerful than that.

11:47.120 --> 11:52.600
But I got the $5 box and then I attached a two terabyte storage, boom, put it on there.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.680
And I'm just experimenting right now.

11:53.680 --> 11:57.280
I don't actually need that much storage, but again, $100 credit, right?

11:57.280 --> 12:01.240
So I threw that on there, put sync thing in a container and got it going.

12:01.240 --> 12:06.320
And I'll tell you what, it actually made a nice improvement in my performance for all

12:06.320 --> 12:07.380
of my machines.

12:07.380 --> 12:11.120
Now they're syncing for multiple locations and at $5 a month, I think I'm going to keep

12:11.120 --> 12:12.120
it.

12:12.120 --> 12:15.280
I'll just refine the storage to exactly what I need and Linode makes it so easy to do that

12:15.280 --> 12:16.280
on demand.

12:16.280 --> 12:20.080
And as soon as I created the device, they gave me the commands, just copy paste them

12:20.080 --> 12:25.280
right into the terminal to, if I wanted to, to mount it as extended for and all that really

12:25.280 --> 12:29.800
straightforward because they make it so easy to just get in, get what you need and get

12:29.800 --> 12:30.800
out.

12:30.800 --> 12:31.800
And that's why I love their dashboard.

12:31.800 --> 12:32.800
I think they really nailed that.

12:32.800 --> 12:36.720
You know, they started in 2003, they've been around for a really long time.

12:36.720 --> 12:42.720
It's three years before AWS and other enterprise providers, but they're independently owned.

12:42.720 --> 12:50.260
Unlike some cloud providers that maybe have a secret investor or a rich Bezos, Linode

12:50.260 --> 12:51.620
is independently owned.

12:51.620 --> 12:54.100
They're the largest independent cloud provider.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.560
How great is that?

12:55.560 --> 13:00.560
And while they've been coming along, they've been investing in open source projects and

13:00.560 --> 13:06.880
get togethers like all things open, my beloved Linux fest Northwest, tons of local hackathons

13:06.880 --> 13:07.880
and meetups.

13:07.880 --> 13:12.920
And now here they are supporting not just this podcast, but lots of Linux content creators

13:12.920 --> 13:17.000
that got into this for a love with, with a passion for Linux.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.940
And now they're supporting the entire Linux ecosystem and they make a great cloud offering.

13:22.940 --> 13:25.460
They're dedicated to offering the best and virtualized cloud computing.

13:25.460 --> 13:32.760
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode, including S3 compatible object storage, node balancers,

13:32.760 --> 13:36.160
cloud firewalls, Kubernetes and Terraform support.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.160
It's all there.

13:37.160 --> 13:42.640
So go to linode.com slash LAN to try it out, get a $100 60 day credit towards a new account

13:42.640 --> 13:44.320
and you support the show.

13:44.320 --> 13:48.780
That's linode.com slash LAN.

13:48.780 --> 13:53.920
After more than four years of development, GTK 4 has finally arrived.

13:53.920 --> 13:58.320
As you can imagine, it's a massive update and a huge milestone for the development of

13:58.320 --> 14:04.040
the open source and cross platform GTK widget toolkit, which is widely used for creating

14:04.040 --> 14:07.000
graphical user interfaces for Linux apps.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.760
And of course for the GNOME project and the wonderful GNOME desktop.

14:10.760 --> 14:14.920
Now for all of you out there going, um, actually Wes it's GTK plus.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.200
Well that has changed with this release.

14:17.200 --> 14:23.600
They're dropping the plus because really no one was saying it anyways, but they've, they've

14:23.600 --> 14:25.080
really worked on this one.

14:25.080 --> 14:29.360
There's been 20 development releases, 18,000 commits.

14:29.360 --> 14:35.440
Now baked in is improved media playback, drake and drop support, layout managers and transform

14:35.440 --> 14:41.160
transforms, scalable lists and grids support for shaders support for Vulkan in here, render

14:41.160 --> 14:45.240
nodes and of course nice to see some improved accessibility overall.

14:45.240 --> 14:52.120
There's a lot of really good stuff that developers now just get by using GTK 4 GTK 4 is now considered

14:52.120 --> 14:57.640
stable from applications to start using importing to, but don't worry, GTK 3 will continue to

14:57.640 --> 15:03.240
be maintained for the foreseeable future, but GTK 2 is no longer going to be supported.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.240
It's done.

15:04.240 --> 15:05.320
So better upgrade.

15:05.320 --> 15:11.100
Also just recently cute six came out and the neon project announced that there was a release

15:11.100 --> 15:14.120
of neon that is basing around cute six now.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.640
So we're starting to see the cute adoption for six over there.

15:16.640 --> 15:17.820
That's really cool.

15:17.820 --> 15:24.000
And you see the GTK 40 or I'm sorry, you see GTK 4 stuff landing right around the time

15:24.000 --> 15:26.600
gnome 40 is in, in development.

15:26.600 --> 15:31.360
So they'll likely be parts of gnome 40 that use GTK 4.

15:31.360 --> 15:35.440
I wouldn't imagine it's all of it, but I think this is part of the reason why they changed.

15:35.440 --> 15:40.740
If I recall the versioning of the gnome desktop is because they wanted to avoid the confusion

15:40.740 --> 15:44.560
between GTK itself, the toolkit and the desktop gnome.

15:44.560 --> 15:49.400
Yeah, that and well, they didn't want to have bad conceptions about what 4.0 meant because

15:49.400 --> 15:52.440
you know, as we mentioned on the show, it's really just an evolution.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.240
It's not a new, huge, crazy release.

15:54.240 --> 15:57.600
It's just the next version of the release, you know?

15:57.600 --> 15:58.600
Yeah.

15:58.600 --> 16:02.800
Although they have been demoing a brand new activities overview and it's blowing people's

16:02.800 --> 16:03.800
minds.

16:03.800 --> 16:05.480
Wes, it's blowing their minds.

16:05.480 --> 16:10.320
Well something else that was blowing people's minds was trying to find our gosh darn matrix

16:10.320 --> 16:11.320
server.

16:11.320 --> 16:15.240
It's been nice to see some upgraded support and improvements to matrix.to.

16:15.240 --> 16:22.160
Yeah, matrix.to is a simple URL redirection service essentially, which lets users share

16:22.160 --> 16:24.520
links to rooms and communities.

16:24.520 --> 16:27.260
And it's not tied to any specific client.

16:27.260 --> 16:31.760
It kind of works as a as an entry way to get into a matrix chat.

16:31.760 --> 16:37.920
In fact, it's often the very first experience people have with matrix.

16:37.920 --> 16:44.660
And until there's a matrix colon slash slash URI scheme, which actually they just did recently

16:44.660 --> 16:46.720
register with the IANA.

16:46.720 --> 16:47.720
So that's exciting.

16:47.720 --> 16:48.720
That's awesome.

16:48.720 --> 16:53.080
matrix.to is pretty much the only client agnostic way to link to content in matrix.

16:53.080 --> 16:56.060
And that's pretty important because while it's great that you can use whatever client

16:56.060 --> 16:59.400
you want with matrix, it makes it a little bit more difficult for onboarding.

16:59.400 --> 17:03.820
You don't say just go get Discord, you say, well, learn about what matrix is and go figure

17:03.820 --> 17:07.200
out that there's multiple clients and then without knowing anything about it, decide

17:07.200 --> 17:11.000
which clients right for you pick that install it and then you can use our server.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.000
Yeah.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.080
And they've they've kind of come up with a way to present this information now in a much

17:16.080 --> 17:19.760
more consumable way for end users.

17:19.760 --> 17:25.120
And they have spent a lot of time reworking this from scratch to help users find the best

17:25.120 --> 17:27.120
client to get started.

17:27.120 --> 17:31.480
Also you can have it optionally remember your choices for future visits.

17:31.480 --> 17:35.960
And it will get full useful previews in the selection screens, you get an idea of what

17:35.960 --> 17:37.280
you are going into.

17:37.280 --> 17:42.960
And I think this is more and more important as over 2020, I have seen a lot of open source

17:42.960 --> 17:46.560
projects adopt matrix for their group chat.

17:46.560 --> 17:51.560
And it's nice because it sort of has slowed what I have seen as a bleeding to slack, which

17:51.560 --> 17:54.800
has never felt like a great fit for open source projects.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.760
And to see more and more pickup matrix, that's wonderful.

17:57.760 --> 18:02.320
But now, as we've discovered firsthand, how do you get people into those rooms?

18:02.320 --> 18:03.320
Right.

18:03.320 --> 18:07.120
The feature there is great, it's a good experience, but it can be a little bit tricky.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.120
Yeah.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.120
And it's not like IRC is simple, but it's been around forever.

18:10.120 --> 18:15.280
So people know, OK, I need an IRC client and I need to slash join and you can go Google

18:15.280 --> 18:18.920
the command syntax real quick if you don't remember how to change your password or anything

18:18.920 --> 18:19.920
like that.

18:19.920 --> 18:20.920
But matrix is still pretty new.

18:20.920 --> 18:24.480
And so they have an opportunity here to make this onboarding process a little bit simpler.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.160
And I think this is going to help.

18:26.160 --> 18:31.800
And I'm looking forward to us making it simpler to link to our colony at jupyterbroadcasting.com

18:31.800 --> 18:32.800
matrix server.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.960
You know, I was trying this out last night and it works pretty nicely.

18:35.960 --> 18:36.960
It was a good experience.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.840
It's nice to see them investing.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.000
And in case you're worried, it is privacy preserving.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
They've thought of that.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.440
No information stored on the server side, all the calculations done just in client side

18:45.440 --> 18:46.440
JavaScript.

18:46.440 --> 18:47.440
So don't have to worry about that.

18:47.440 --> 18:50.680
It's funny, too, that this started out as just a sort of minimal viable product.

18:50.680 --> 18:51.680
You know, oh, here's a quick idea.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.060
Now you can link to rooms.

18:53.060 --> 18:54.360
It could have remained that way.

18:54.360 --> 18:58.560
But you know, thanks to actual time and effort here, we've got a much better product and

18:58.560 --> 18:59.860
I love it.

18:59.860 --> 19:01.000
Another area that's getting some work.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.840
I mean, it's totally, totally proof of concept.

19:04.840 --> 19:11.500
But they have introduced over at Matrix a possible a possible social network that lives

19:11.500 --> 19:14.040
on top of Matrix.

19:14.040 --> 19:20.380
It's called Cerulean and it's kind of like a Twitter or mastodon that is using underpinnings

19:20.380 --> 19:22.440
of Matrix chat rooms.

19:22.440 --> 19:25.920
I don't know why, but I kind of like it.

19:25.920 --> 19:31.200
Well, I think it's just an interesting attempt to stretch the capabilities of Matrix, right?

19:31.200 --> 19:35.000
To see, can you build a system like this given the primitives that you have?

19:35.000 --> 19:39.200
Because as much as Matrix is, you know, something we see as a client facing user, just chatting

19:39.200 --> 19:43.880
with the folks in our community, really, it's this this whole rich ecosystem of protocols

19:43.880 --> 19:46.960
that you can use to work together to build all kinds of things.

19:46.960 --> 19:51.280
And one of the things they've been working on here is more arbitrary nested threading

19:51.280 --> 19:52.280
support.

19:52.280 --> 19:56.160
They've done potential improvements that they've only implemented so far in dendrite, which

19:56.160 --> 20:00.620
is the up and coming rust based home server that has a lot of exciting new features, perhaps

20:00.620 --> 20:02.600
like this, where it's getting tried out.

20:02.600 --> 20:07.080
So if you want to go play with it, you can view it online or you can even register.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.520
They've got their own test dendrite server running.

20:09.520 --> 20:13.160
And then right now, the only test instance of Cerulean is talking to that.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.520
You know, this is your Linux action news pro tip here.

20:15.520 --> 20:19.880
But if Matrix is one of those topics you kind of been avoiding, I don't need anything else.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.440
IRC is fine or whatever.

20:21.440 --> 20:25.160
Maybe maybe maybe 2021 is the year to start taking it seriously.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.840
There's some really awesome free software getting developed here.

20:27.840 --> 20:30.840
And there's a lot of great communities that are collecting over there doesn't take anything

20:30.840 --> 20:33.000
away from any of the other great places.

20:33.000 --> 20:37.320
And you know, with all the bridges, Matrix is not too bad to be a part of because you

20:37.320 --> 20:39.240
can connect to a lot of other communities.

20:39.240 --> 20:40.240
That's a great point.

20:40.240 --> 20:44.240
One other interesting aspect that they're playing with as a way to perhaps change or

20:44.240 --> 20:47.740
improve the matrix platform is decentralized reputation, right?

20:47.740 --> 20:50.760
How do you one one problem in some of these decentralized communities is, well, how do

20:50.760 --> 20:55.960
you manage problematic users, spams, trolls, that can be difficult.

20:55.960 --> 20:59.800
There's some ideas, the Matrix folks have put out a blog post and some videos talking

20:59.800 --> 21:03.920
about some of their ideas, and maybe Cerulean will be the first place that you see those

21:03.920 --> 21:04.920
attempted.

21:04.920 --> 21:08.320
Yeah, it could be really kind of a decent way to solve that problem.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.980
And you know, you could just avoid certain types of topics.

21:10.980 --> 21:14.320
If that's your preference, you don't have to avoid people, you could avoid topics.

21:14.320 --> 21:16.240
Or the opposite is true.

21:16.240 --> 21:19.400
If there's a certain topic you're particularly interested in, I think you could probably

21:19.400 --> 21:24.480
find it a little easier, indeed.

21:24.480 --> 21:25.560
Linux dot ting dot com.

21:25.560 --> 21:27.760
The next generation of ting mobile is here.

21:27.760 --> 21:32.120
So go see how much you could save and get twenty five dollars off at Linux dot ting

21:32.120 --> 21:33.120
dot com.

21:33.120 --> 21:40.600
I have been a customer of ting for over eight years, and now I can tell you is the best

21:40.600 --> 21:45.880
time ever to sign up for ting to go to Linux dot ting dot com and see what I'm talking

21:45.880 --> 21:46.880
about.

21:46.880 --> 21:50.680
And if you want to talk in text, you can get that for just ten dollars a month.

21:50.680 --> 21:54.440
Yeah, and data plans, they start at fifteen dollars and they have unlimited plans start

21:54.440 --> 21:55.440
forty five dollars.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.440
How about that?

21:56.440 --> 22:00.200
So if you use two gigs, twenty gigs, hundred gigs, there's going to be a perfect ting plan

22:00.200 --> 22:01.600
for you and your family.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.600
Don't worry.

22:02.600 --> 22:03.600
Don't worry.

22:03.600 --> 22:05.840
The only thing that's changing here is lower monthly prices.

22:05.840 --> 22:11.240
You still get access to ting's award winning customer service with nationwide LTE and 5G

22:11.240 --> 22:13.400
coverage and no contracts ever.

22:13.400 --> 22:18.480
You can pretty much take care of everything through ting's dashboard, really dang near

22:18.480 --> 22:22.880
everything in a way that sets the bar above what every other carrier allows you to do.

22:22.880 --> 22:31.000
But twice in eight years, I have had to call in one time when I was on the road and struggling

22:31.000 --> 22:33.960
to get a my fi that I bought off Amazon working.

22:33.960 --> 22:37.560
They had no reason to stay on the phone with me for as long as they did, but two hours

22:37.560 --> 22:41.680
later and really them just trying out out everything they could.

22:41.680 --> 22:44.800
We actually had it up and running and I had connectivity on the road.

22:44.800 --> 22:45.800
I couldn't believe it.

22:45.800 --> 22:49.180
I mean, the rep really invested in solving my problem.

22:49.180 --> 22:51.240
That is sticking around.

22:51.240 --> 22:55.400
But now you can choose from three different plans based on your data needs.

22:55.400 --> 22:56.640
It's simple to switch to ting.

22:56.640 --> 23:00.900
So you just had to Linux dot ting dot com and check your current phone.

23:00.900 --> 23:03.240
Pretty much any phone will work on ting.

23:03.240 --> 23:06.880
You create an account, you pick the plan that's right for you and the fam or just you.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.000
And I don't know, I don't judge your whole crew.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.320
I don't know how you do.

23:10.320 --> 23:11.860
And then ting will send you the SIM card.

23:11.860 --> 23:14.760
You pop it in your phone and you get going.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.960
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier with ting's mobile with ting's

23:17.960 --> 23:20.000
new mobile plans.

23:20.000 --> 23:25.440
You can get talk and text or ten dollars a month and data plans starting at 15 and 25

23:25.440 --> 23:27.200
and then unlimited for 45.

23:27.200 --> 23:28.480
You just got to get the right one for you.

23:28.480 --> 23:30.720
It'll be all explained on the ting website.

23:30.720 --> 23:31.720
This is great.

23:31.720 --> 23:36.200
After eight years, I can say this truly is the next generation of ting mobile.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.200
It's here.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.760
Go see how much you could save and get twenty five dollars off.

23:39.760 --> 23:41.880
Visit Linux dot ting dot com.

23:41.880 --> 23:45.120
And a big thank you to ting for sponsoring this show and making it possible for independent

23:45.120 --> 23:47.720
media to put their content out there for free.

23:47.720 --> 23:52.200
And thanks to everybody who visits Linux dot ting dot com.

23:52.200 --> 23:57.520
Google's AMP, previously known as accelerated mobile pages, took a beating this week as

23:57.520 --> 24:02.920
an antitrust lawsuit filed by the attorney general of Texas charges that the ad company

24:02.920 --> 24:05.720
used AMP to hinder competition.

24:05.720 --> 24:10.920
And on Friday, Terence Eden, a prominent member of the AMP Advisory Committee, which was formed

24:10.920 --> 24:15.640
two years ago in response to criticism that the AMP project ignored publisher concerns,

24:15.640 --> 24:19.960
announced his resignation, citing the project's failure to make the Web better.

24:19.960 --> 24:25.720
Yeah, AMP was created by Google in 2015 with the public argument that it was designed to

24:25.720 --> 24:31.000
make the mobile Web load faster and essentially as a defense against things like the Apple

24:31.000 --> 24:33.540
news format and Facebook instant articles.

24:33.540 --> 24:37.560
But the technology has had its detractors almost since its inception.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.820
And over time, that has just grown louder and louder.

24:40.820 --> 24:47.400
So by 2018, Google attempted to satisfy some of these critics by broadening the governance

24:47.400 --> 24:48.760
of AMP.

24:48.760 --> 24:52.800
And they said we would bring it beyond just Google employees.

24:52.800 --> 24:56.940
It would be more like a true open source project.

24:56.940 --> 25:02.160
But any goodwill Google may have won with those actions could be undone if these claims

25:02.160 --> 25:05.520
about AMP and the new complaint prove true.

25:05.520 --> 25:09.600
For some context here, after the complaint was made public, Robin Bergeon, VP of data

25:09.600 --> 25:13.520
governance at The New York Times, said on Twitter that, every time I point out that

25:13.520 --> 25:18.280
AMP is bad, someone from Google will tell me it's not.

25:18.280 --> 25:23.000
This new complaint indicates that Google has documented exactly how bad AMP is and ties

25:23.000 --> 25:26.280
it to a deliberate play to prevent competition from header bidding.

25:26.280 --> 25:32.440
Now, that is interesting because it gets into some potential foul play attempts in the web

25:32.440 --> 25:33.440
ad market.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.120
But the complaint goes further than that.

25:35.120 --> 25:40.520
Yeah, the complaint also claims that Google's transfer of AMP to the OpenJS Foundation doesn't

25:40.520 --> 25:44.840
really change the company's capacity to control the project because, quote, Google controls

25:44.840 --> 25:48.100
the foundation's board and debates internally.

25:48.100 --> 25:52.320
It also alleges that Google falsely told publishers that adopting AMP would enhance load times

25:52.320 --> 25:58.800
and that the company went so far as to hinder non-AMP ads by giving them artificial one-second

25:58.800 --> 26:02.240
delays to convince publishers not to use header bidding.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.240
That doesn't sound good.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.240
No, not fair at all.

26:05.240 --> 26:06.880
But again, these are allegations.

26:06.880 --> 26:08.200
We don't know if that's true.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.200
True, true.

26:09.200 --> 26:13.360
The AMP committee member who resigned in his post, which we do have linked in the show

26:13.360 --> 26:18.240
notes, said that he joined because the stated goal of the committee was to make AMP a great

26:18.240 --> 26:20.000
web citizen.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.720
But he then went on to say, I'm concerned that despite the hard work of the AMP committee,

26:24.720 --> 26:27.800
Google has limited interest in that goal.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.640
I think that's the crux of the issue here.

26:30.640 --> 26:34.800
It's tricky because AMP on its own, just on technical grounds, is kind of controversial.

26:34.800 --> 26:38.560
And I can see how reasonable people might come down either way on if it's a good thing

26:38.560 --> 26:39.560
or not.

26:39.560 --> 26:43.480
But all of Google's involvement here, you just can't separate that out.

26:43.480 --> 26:46.440
I mean, to this day, there's still only two caches.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.440
That's Google's and Bing's.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.960
And Bing's is actually still pretty recently added.

26:49.960 --> 26:53.080
So it's hard to argue that Google's not really pulling the strings.

26:53.080 --> 26:57.400
And even if you want to make AMP great for everyone, it doesn't seem like they're that

26:57.400 --> 26:58.880
interested, unfortunately.

26:58.880 --> 27:05.080
AWS is trying to show them up by supporting the Blender project.

27:05.080 --> 27:09.880
They note that, quote, we are excited to continue to expand our support of open source solutions

27:09.880 --> 27:13.240
for our customers in the digital content creation space.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.880
That was the GM of Creative Tools at AWS.

27:15.880 --> 27:20.000
Also, it looks like the Blender Foundation will start recruiting throughout the course

27:20.000 --> 27:25.640
of 2021, pending current travel and meeting restrictions being lifted or relaxed.

27:25.640 --> 27:31.760
AWS committed to a period of three years for this support and specifically to support character

27:31.760 --> 27:35.680
animation tools development, which is something the Blender has been working on with a new

27:35.680 --> 27:39.520
character animation system dubbed Animation 2020.

27:39.520 --> 27:45.240
And it seems like some folks at AWS like industry veteran Jason Schleifler, creative director

27:45.240 --> 27:48.880
there, are quite interested in seeing this continuing to develop.

27:48.880 --> 27:52.040
Why do you suppose they have interest in something like Blender?

27:52.040 --> 27:54.840
Are people uploading Blender projects to the cloud?

27:54.840 --> 27:56.580
So yes, actually.

27:56.580 --> 28:01.800
Some folks do use AWS for media and content creation, including rendering big renders

28:01.800 --> 28:04.400
on cloud powerhouse boxes.

28:04.400 --> 28:09.000
And it sounds like with things like AWS ThinkBox and other digital content creation, it's an

28:09.000 --> 28:11.920
area AWS is looking to explore.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.920
So that is fascinating.

28:13.920 --> 28:14.920
Didn't expect that.

28:14.920 --> 28:19.240
I think I've also seen that there is and I don't really fully appreciate it, but there

28:19.240 --> 28:23.800
is some working with with AI models of some type in Blender as well.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.680
That might also be an interest of AWS.

28:25.680 --> 28:29.920
Well, you know, it has definitely been an interest of some other past supporters like

28:29.920 --> 28:38.200
Microsoft and Facebook, both who specifically mentioned training AR or AI models with Blender.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.360
Microsoft's case is actually kind of interesting.

28:39.360 --> 28:42.960
They're taking data and then building synthetic training data with these.

28:42.960 --> 28:47.360
They're making human models, moving the models around and then using that as training data

28:47.360 --> 28:48.760
for their AI systems.

28:48.760 --> 28:49.760
Crazy.

28:49.760 --> 28:50.760
That is really wild.

28:50.760 --> 28:56.960
Yeah, they, Microsoft joined the Blender Development Fund on July 29th of this year.

28:56.960 --> 29:01.060
Unity joined the Blender Development Fund as well on August 21st.

29:01.060 --> 29:04.560
And Facebook joined this year on November 19th.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.960
And they say here, part of that, Facebook has been building tools that help artists

29:07.960 --> 29:13.240
turn their Blender creations into engaging AR experiences in Spark AR.

29:13.240 --> 29:20.160
So a lot of different motivations coming together to back the Blender Foundation, which means

29:20.160 --> 29:22.600
they have a decent amount of cash coming in now.

29:22.600 --> 29:24.560
Yeah, they sure do.

29:24.560 --> 29:34.400
$155,567 is a monthly contribution from 5,283 individuals and 53 corporate backers.

29:34.400 --> 29:39.960
They get 33% of their income from individual sponsors, 28 just from Epic Games, hey, what

29:39.960 --> 29:40.960
a patron that is.

29:40.960 --> 29:41.960
No kidding.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.880
And then 27% from other corporate sponsors.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.440
And what do they do with that money?

29:46.440 --> 29:50.920
Well, primarily they pay salaries for people to develop Blender along with other support

29:50.920 --> 29:52.240
for the project.

29:52.240 --> 29:56.220
This is really fascinating to see because we've always talked about what does it take

29:56.220 --> 30:02.120
to develop a truly industrial grade tool in the audio visual space.

30:02.120 --> 30:04.060
And now we're seeing, I mean, it takes staff.

30:04.060 --> 30:11.200
It takes funding and it takes market momentum to really build a tool at this scale.

30:11.200 --> 30:15.400
And I'm really impressed to just watch Blender go.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.400
It's amazing.

30:16.400 --> 30:19.840
And I think it is really an open source success story in the best case of, we figured out

30:19.840 --> 30:25.400
that in this case, right, a good open source 3D modeling program is better as open source

30:25.400 --> 30:29.760
shared infrastructure than it is in having competing proprietary applications, like tons

30:29.760 --> 30:31.900
of companies and individuals need this stuff.

30:31.900 --> 30:33.080
Let's all work on it together.

30:33.080 --> 30:37.000
Well, that open source Goombaya brings us to the end of this week's podcast, but go
