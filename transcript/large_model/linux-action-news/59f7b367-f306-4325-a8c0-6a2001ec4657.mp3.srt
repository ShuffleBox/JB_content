00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,460
This is episode 39, recorded on February 4th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,460
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,460
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,460
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,460
Good morning to you.

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,260
It's good to be connected again, and we have some big news.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,560
Red Hat is acquiring CoreOS.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,640
Yes, as they say, expanding their Kubernetes and containers leadership in a move that can

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,880
only be described as buying up the competition, as far as I'm concerned.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,040
Well, it's also an acquihire, too, really, which I hate that term, but it is about bringing

12
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,040
on people that have been working with Kubernetes and container technologies for years as their

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,120
core focus, now under the Red Hat brand.

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,280
Although it sounds like it's going to maintain its own individuality, at least for a while,

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,280
more like CentOS.

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,960
Well, CentOS is the first thing that sprung to mind.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,960
That was eating potentially some of their business away, and so they decided to control

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,120
it by buying it.

19
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,440
But they have decided to let that continue doing what it's doing.

20
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,640
So I could see with CoreOS they would do that.

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,240
And it looks like they are more interested in the people making CoreOS and their expertise

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,480
than the actual product itself, because after all, it's free software.

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,440
They could just take that code and do whatever they wanted with it, as long as they comply

24
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,840
with the license.

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,200
This makes a lot of sense, this purchase, looking at this.

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,160
Red Hat needed to do something like this to really move forward.

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,400
This is just an area of the server market that is exploding right now, and Red Hat being

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,520
one of the big names in that market, needed to have a complete, full offering and a real

29
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,520
solid expertise.

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,800
The thing is, is some of the technologies that CoreOS have developed are already the

31
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,520
umbrella of the Linux Foundation.

32
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,040
So now Red Hat is acquiring technology or people behind the technology that is essentially

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,000
an industry standard at this point.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,720
And they've really been able to bring the competitive edge to Docker and have really

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,360
sort of kept Docker and Docker Swarm at bay.

36
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:09,520
And for $250 million, this is a steal.

37
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,340
Think about it like this, Facebook paid a billion dollars for Instagram.

38
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:19,320
This CoreOS stuff, it's not just CoreOS, it's all of the underlying technologies that they've

39
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,240
open sourced and that they're experts in.

40
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,800
This stuff is crazy valuable.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,640
It's what businesses are built out of.

42
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,980
Well, there's a reason why Red Hat are the biggest open source company.

43
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,040
They're very sharp, aren't they?

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,720
They keep making the right business decisions.

45
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,940
And thankfully, they keep everything open source.

46
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,000
So you can't really knock them, can you?

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,120
This is yet another very sharp business decision from them, because they know how to stay relevant

48
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,520
in the open source world.

49
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,500
And now going forward, they're going to remain relevant, aren't they?

50
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,020
My down the road thing I'll be watching for after this acquisition is what happens with

51
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,040
Fedora Atomic fully.

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,840
Do they alter that project to be more something in line with CoreOS?

53
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,740
Do they share technologies more between them?

54
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,480
Because there's a lot of overlap there.

55
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,280
And so that'll be interesting to watch just say a year from now.

56
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,480
Or does Fedora Atomic continue on its own and just keep getting better?

57
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,920
I suspect the latter, because it's always a good idea to have competition even within

58
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,160
your own company, isn't it?

59
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,520
If you've kind of got this arms race going on and pushing the features forward in both

60
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,260
of them, then it's probably more valuable ultimately than just getting rid of one and

61
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,360
putting all your eggs in one basket.

62
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,000
So the big technology that's getting talked about in this acquisition is Kubernetes.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,920
And the interesting story behind Kubernetes is that it was a Google Skunk Works project.

64
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,760
This is Google-backed technology that was spun off onto its own.

65
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,880
And now that's what Red Hat's really acquiring.

66
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,140
It's a fascinating story.

67
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,100
If you'd like to know more, check out TechSnap.Systems slash 353.

68
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:51,320
We have an easy intro into Kubernetes and a deeper context into why this technology

69
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,560
is really important to Red Hat in the future, like Joe was just implying.

70
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,320
It's a major purchase that's going to keep them relevant, and that episode explains why.

71
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,560
Yeah, and there's also fun facts like their logo is Star Trek related, which you liked,

72
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
no doubt.

73
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Of course I did.

74
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,840
Now, there's something that everybody always loves.

75
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,280
It's the soft spot we all have on our heart for LibreOffice.

76
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,000
Why Joe, I remember when it was OpenOffice and StarOffice before that.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,640
Now we have version 6.0 of LibreOffice.

78
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,160
This is something that I struggle to get excited about, but I think we have to talk about it.

79
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,280
It seems like a very solid release to me in terms of features, in terms of the file compatibility

80
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,440
and just pushing it forward and trying to remain competitive with what Microsoft are

81
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,980
doing with their Office suite.

82
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,320
And for me, it's already full-featured enough, even really old versions of it.

83
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,120
I don't need very much functionality, but you do have to stay relevant if you're going

84
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,160
to compete with Microsoft, and if you're going to have government switching over and enterprises

85
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,800
switching over, this is the kind of thing that they need to be doing.

86
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,000
And so it all seems pretty positive to me, but as I said, I'm struggling to get too excited,

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm afraid.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Fair enough.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I pretty much feel the same way.

90
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,520
There are a couple of features that jumped out at me.

91
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,600
For those of us that are trying to reclaim their vertical space, there's a new tabbed

92
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,500
compact view mode for Ryder.

93
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,720
And it's a streamlined version of the standard tab notebook bar that's more like the Office

94
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,280
ribbon, but it's less vertical and it's more like a browser tab.

95
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,440
That's sort of nice for those of us that are currently on a kick like I am.

96
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,080
But probably the biggest feature of LibreOffice 6.0 is the ability to export Ryder documents

97
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
to EPUB.

98
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,320
Yeah, that could be a very useful feature in terms of e-readers, and EPUB is just such

99
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,280
a standard now that I'm surprised that they didn't have that before, to be honest.

100
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,920
The other thing that they've baked in, which I'm really happy to see, is open PGP document

101
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,600
signing and encryption support.

102
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,940
Yeah, and even individual paragraphs can be signed, can't they?

103
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,520
That is a really cool feature.

104
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,480
That almost is worth the upgrade right there.

105
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,680
Yeah, it's definitely worth checking out, and hopefully the snap for it will be updated

106
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,240
fairly soon.

107
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,280
And that's something you've been immersed in all week, haven't you, at the SnapCraft

108
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,920
Summit in Seattle?

109
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,320
Yeah, it was downtown at the Hilton Seattle on 6th Avenue, and we drove down there every

110
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,040
day from the studio, and I don't think we ever got home until before 10 p.m. a single

111
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
night.

112
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,800
Most nights, I think it was after 11 p.m.

113
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,640
They work hard.

114
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,180
And this is sort of like the New York event I went to six months ago, but much smaller

115
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,600
in scale, and in some ways more intense in its focus.

116
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,840
So at the New York event, there was about, I don't know, 300 people there?

117
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,780
There's probably about 50 people at this event.

118
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:38,440
And I had a chance to talk with developers from Slack, Microsoft, Azure, Electron, the

119
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:45,360
.NET project, the Skype project, TypeScript, PowerShell, a Visual Studio code developer,

120
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:54,160
JetBrains employees, and someone who's responsible for some packaging tasks at Plex, which was

121
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,040
a fascinating discussion.

122
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,900
It is way more complex than I ever thought possible.

123
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:06,480
And they were there from about 9 a.m. till about 6 p.m., and usually a little bit later

124
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,720
every single day.

125
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,200
Then they would break off after that and go into individual groups, and essentially just

126
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,980
keep working, but at a lower pace.

127
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:20,080
And even when the internet went out, they were so intent on getting work done that they

128
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:27,440
leaned on the hotel staff to move them to an entirely different hotel, a competitor's

129
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,940
hotel, so they could keep working with their internet connection.

130
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,120
And every time we walked in the room, it was very hushed.

131
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
Everybody was very serious.

132
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,920
They had one secret room where I'm not allowed to repeat what I heard in there or record

133
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,120
anything, so I didn't spend a lot of time in there.

134
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,920
I just went in there to kind of get a general impression of what it was like and document

135
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,240
it, but I didn't really, didn't end up camping out there like I thought I might because what's

136
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,160
the point if I can't repeat anything I heard?

137
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,920
So we pulled people aside and chatted with them, and the main thing that we really took

138
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,200
away is Canonical has come up with a way to solve a problem for them.

139
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,420
So when they're going to Skype or they're going to Slack or they're potentially one

140
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:12,320
day going to Plex, they're solving something that maybe they have a staff of people and

141
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,480
all of these hacked-together scripts to pull off.

142
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,080
And so it's a real problem they're trying to solve, and the auto-update mechanism of

143
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,280
Snaps is extremely appealing to some of these companies.

144
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,360
What I witnessed was a Canonical advantage that I don't think Flatpaks or App Images

145
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,760
will ever have, and that is the fact that there are administrative personnel in Canonical's

146
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,880
offices who can call administrative personnel at Plex's office and Microsoft's office, and

147
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,840
the administrative personnel can coordinate scheduling for resources below them, and then

148
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,660
those companies send their resources to an agreed-upon location, and their resources

149
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,240
do the work that they've been tasked to do.

150
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,160
That's the one advantage I feel that a bureaucracy can bring to open-source development is that

151
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,760
when it gets to the layer where it has to be business-to-business, they can facilitate

152
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,200
that communication.

153
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,600
They can tell them, hey, we have a problem to solve.

154
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,140
They can afford to pay staff members to advocate something to Microsoft, to Slack, and they

155
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:18,040
can afford to say pay them for a year to campaign Slack before it actually bears any fruit.

156
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,880
I'm not trying to take away from Flatpaks or App Images.

157
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,200
Those are great solutions.

158
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,440
They have their markets.

159
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,620
I'm just trying to illustrate where I think SNAPs might have a competitive advantage,

160
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,400
and they're going to carve out a certain type of applications that perhaps the other packaging

161
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,160
formats won't.

162
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,600
It's interesting that the big headline for it really was this Skype SNAP.

163
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,680
I think they had the release of that embargo, didn't they, until this summit, and also have

164
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,940
had the Slack SNAP as well recently, but if you look on insights.abuntu.com at the posts

165
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:57,640
about this event, they are filed under IoT rather than desktop, and that is where I thought

166
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,880
they were really focusing the SNAP stuff, because that's where it's profitable on digital

167
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,600
signage and edge devices, as Shotworth calls them.

168
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,680
So I was quite surprised that there was such a heavy desktop focus at this event.

169
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
That's a good observation.

170
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,080
I wonder if it's filed under IoT on their website, because it's sort of from the Click

171
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,720
Packages era, which was very much focused on IoT.

172
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,040
Maybe, maybe, but I know a lot of SNAP stuff is for IoT, so maybe they've just got that

173
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,600
sorted at this stage, and now they're moving into the desktop more.

174
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,200
Well, or having a big name use your package formats, even if it's a desktop application,

175
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,280
probably still gets your foot in the door when you're trying to talk to QNAP about how

176
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,560
they ship their updates.

177
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,920
Yeah, that's definitely true.

178
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,520
If you've got a huge name like Skype on board, then that's got to help in those meetings,

179
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
isn't it?

180
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,880
The other thing that they're very cleverly doing is they're working with the tool builders

181
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,280
at the tool level, so say, Electron Builder, or insert whatever application, maybe it's

182
00:10:56,280 --> 00:11:01,360
Known Builder, when the developer hits export, so in the case of Electron Builder, when they

183
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,600
go to export a Windows, Mac, and Linux version of an Electron app, they now have an option

184
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,800
when they put in one additional export command to also just export from Electron Builder

185
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,280
right to a SNAP package.

186
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,520
It's early days, but this is the level they're thinking at, is work at the tool levels, so

187
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:22,320
that way when the developers are hitting their targets, it's just baked right in, they can

188
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
export right to SNAP.

189
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,540
I can't say I'm really surprised at these huge names coming on board with SNAP, because

190
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,080
Shotworth has thrown a lot of investment behind it, not just with these events in New York

191
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:38,340
and Seattle, but a lot of developer resources and community management stuff.

192
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,760
They're all in on SNAPs at this point, and they have been for a while, and now it's starting

193
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,160
to actually work and produce results for them.

194
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,760
So the real question is, who's going to be next?

195
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,280
I suspect more Microsoft stuff went on in that secret room.

196
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,640
Joe, I think that's probably an accurate suspicion, and in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if that

197
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,480
Skype SNAP has some improvements in the near term future that us Linux users are going

198
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,560
to extremely appreciate, and it might just make it the de facto way most of us install

199
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,400
Skype in the future.

200
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
DigitalOcean.com.

201
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,880
Go over there, create your account, and then use our promo code, here's the thing.

202
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,040
It's all one word, smash it together, and get a promo code of $10.

203
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,760
Then you can spin up a $5 dropletter with any of their other rigs and try it out for

204
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,760
free.

205
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,120
You get a $10 credit, no credit card required, it just goes right to your account, and you

206
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,700
can spin up that $5 dropletter.

207
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,740
Take a look at all of the different options.

208
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,160
They have ready to deploy pre-built applications.

209
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,880
You want to go give Nextcloud a try like we did a few weeks ago?

210
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,640
You can deploy it all with a single click on DigitalOcean.

211
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:49,400
Or you can build just a base system, everything's SSD backed, all of the systems have SSD drives,

212
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,320
and now they have serious compute systems as well.

213
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,520
They have new optimized compute workloads, they have high memory systems, expandable,

214
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,560
easy to use storage, and they've just revamped their pricing so it's a better deal than ever.

215
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,880
My favorite DigitalOcean droplet is just three cents an hour.

216
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,280
You get four gigs of RAM, two virtual CPUs, and 80 gigabytes of SSD, beautiful fast storage.

217
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,360
And DigitalOcean has built-in monitoring, network level firewalls so the dirty packets

218
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,800
never even hit your machines, and so many great ready to go applications at a single

219
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
click.

220
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,880
And coming soon, new features like per second billing, and lots of other cool stuff.

221
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,440
Predictable pay-as-you-go pricing, an elegant API, and a straightforward dashboard.

222
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:36,600
With Xeon.com promo code, here's the thing.

223
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,840
Quick catch up from last week.

224
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,200
We talked about testing Plasma Mobile.

225
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:46,680
Well part two of that series of blog posts has been posted now, and it's more about testing

226
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,440
it on actual mobile hardware.

227
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,840
The first one was about testing it on virtual machines and x86 machines, but now this is

228
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,840
about how to actually get it on something that it should be running on.

229
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:05,480
And there are a few ways to do it with post-market OS, and Hallium, and a couple of devices that

230
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,480
they've got actual images pre-built for.

231
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,840
So you've got no excuse now, you've got to try out Plasma Mobile and see how much potential

232
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
it has.

233
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,240
I love that they have an image for the Nexus 7 2013.

234
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,720
I have a soft spot for that tablet.

235
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,840
If I still had that around, that feels like it would be perfect size for Plasma Mobile.

236
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,820
Yeah, if someone wanted to get into custom ROMs and stuff like that, that is the one

237
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,400
device I would recommend, because there are just so many ROMs for it, and it's also a

238
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
great tablet.

239
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,240
Once you stick lineage on it, it's still, even though it's, what, five years old at

240
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,760
this point, it's still a really great tablet.

241
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,560
So yeah, you should get a hold of one.

242
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,640
You could probably get one off Craigslist for like 50 bucks or something.

243
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,880
Yeah, you know, it might almost be worth it with these kinds of things.

244
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,360
I see there's another approach too, if you have the Nexus 5 or 5X, 5X is still a pretty

245
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,660
decent phone too for these alternative images.

246
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,160
It's the Helium-based approach, I believe, but if you've got a 5X, give that a shot

247
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
too.

248
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,000
Yeah, and you'll see how far Plasma Mobile has come along.

249
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,360
As I said last week, it's not really yet, but it's certainly getting there.

250
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,600
Well, speaking of getting there and updates, Purism has another update on their Road to

251
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,280
the Librem 5, and they talk a little in this post about PureOS and GNOME and KDE support.

252
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,880
Yeah, that PR train keeps on chugging, eh?

253
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,400
We're talking about it once again.

254
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,080
Yeah, this is probably the post I wish they hadn't made, because it was the red flag to

255
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,640
me that is really sort of concerning.

256
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:34,500
They expand more, Todd does in this post, Todd, the CEO of Purism.

257
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,640
He expands more in this post about how they'll be integrating both GNOME and KDE.

258
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,720
Of course, in his parlance, he says partnered, because that's how everybody phrases it, and

259
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,460
he says that users that use PureOS on the Librem 5 will get a choice of the GNOME environment

260
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,200
or the KDE Plasma environment.

261
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,320
And of course, that doesn't mean just the option of GNOME or Plasma desktop on the Librem

262
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,560
5 or whatever mobile versions they are at that point.

263
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,760
It also means an entire stack of Qt and an entire stack of GTK.

264
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,280
Now I have to agree with you, I think, on this one, because okay, choice is always good,

265
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,880
and offering people those two choices on the surface of things seems great.

266
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,080
Okay, well, I prefer Plasma Mobile, I prefer GNOME, whatever.

267
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,200
But when this was funded, we talked about how the margins on this were very small.

268
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,720
They don't have a lot of money in relative terms.

269
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,240
They've only got a couple of million dollars to play with here, which is not much when

270
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,040
you're developing an operating system from scratch.

271
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,600
And for me, just pick something and stick with it.

272
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Don't have all these choices, because it's not just GNOME and KDE either.

273
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,980
There's even talk of UbiPorts or Ubuntu Touch being available for it, which is surely a

274
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,600
terrible idea to have three potential avenues to go down.

275
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,520
You've just got to pick one and stick with it and make it really good.

276
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,860
And once it comes out and is good and all the rest of it, facilitate people porting

277
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,620
other stuff to it and make it so that you can install other things on it.

278
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,520
And that's the whole point of it being free and open.

279
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah, this is a red flag.

280
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,440
And it does concern me, because if they blow this, the dream may die with them.

281
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,480
No one's really going to take this seriously.

282
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,680
And the red flags are very obvious at this point.

283
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,320
In my mind, this may actually just spell the doom of the project, because it betrays a

284
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,280
problem with Todd himself, I believe.

285
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,200
You see, I think Todd Weaver can't see past his own vision.

286
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:35,000
And he believes that he can bridge the gap between his incredible PureOS that a few thousand

287
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,520
people are using to the mobile operating system.

288
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,240
And so when they talk about it in this post, they talk about their investment in GNOME

289
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,720
so far and that user base and how that user base is going to be able to run their applications

290
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
on their phone.

291
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,900
That user base doesn't matter.

292
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,600
If you have less than 300,000 active users on your distribution, you're not even in the

293
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,600
top 10.

294
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,320
You're maybe, maybe, maybe in the top 10.

295
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,060
You're definitely not in the top five.

296
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:04,640
So this precious investment of yours is meaningless.

297
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,200
Those users will mean nothing if the Librem 5 is successful.

298
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,100
But you are strapping an anchor to the Librem 5 because of this vision of yours and this

299
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,820
investment that you've made in your PureOS GNOME users.

300
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,840
Which don't make any sense, because the fundamental issue with the phone is that it is not a desktop.

301
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,100
It's not an x86 computer with 512 gigs of storage and 32 gigabytes of RAM.

302
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,560
It is a confined, limited environment.

303
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,560
And the issue with offering both a plasma stack and a GNOME stack on your phone is that

304
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,560
you muddy the story for developers.

305
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,740
They need it really clear and simple.

306
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,780
They need, this is how you write the application.

307
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,320
This is the toolkit you use.

308
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,160
These are the pre-made widgets that you use.

309
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,440
This is how you package that application.

310
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,760
This is where you ship the application to the end users.

311
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,300
We have living proof of this in elementary OS.

312
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,840
They're not the largest distribution in the pond, and yet they've seen over 70 new applications

313
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,440
submitted to their little app center this year alone because they have a great story

314
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
for developers.

315
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,400
They have widgets and toolkits that are clear and easy to use.

316
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,120
They have good documentation.

317
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,520
It's a singular story.

318
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,820
They're not telling them to write cute apps and GTK apps and use their own custom compositor

319
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,480
or use something that was built by the KWIN project.

320
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,240
And that's just issue number one.

321
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,720
Issue number two is you already have a snowball's chance in hell of this thing being successful

322
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,320
to begin with.

323
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,120
Everybody knows that.

324
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,480
And so the more you split your attention, your company's focus, and your developer's

325
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,480
focus, the more technical debt that you're taking on, the closer and closer you inch

326
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,320
the project to doom.

327
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,640
And fundamentally, another issue is, is the GNOME developers aren't all that interested

328
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
upstream.

329
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,920
The Plasma mobile developers have been interested for years, and they're shipping it, as we

330
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,760
just explained, on physical hardware right now for testing.

331
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,080
The GNOME developers have kind of given up on mobile.

332
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,700
They're not all that interested, and they have fundamental technical issues with the

333
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:01,600
way GNOME Shell's built that you would have to overcome to make it work on your phone.

334
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,400
And that's just right here off the top of my head.

335
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,200
Well, overcoming those issues by maybe writing your own Wayland compositor, which Purism

336
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,600
are now talking about.

337
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Yes.

338
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,240
It just seems madness to me, that.

339
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,440
Yeah, it's really unfortunate, because they're going to kill the dream here.

340
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,360
Or they're going to create a meme that the open source community can never ship a mobile

341
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,680
operating system.

342
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:24,160
And what's frustrating is it feels like Todd, and this is why I say Todd Weaver can't see

343
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,400
past his own vision here, is he hasn't taken any lessons from any of the previous open

344
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,880
source projects that have taken a shot at this.

345
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:37,280
It's like free R&D at his company, and he's just ignoring all this R&D research for years

346
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
at his company.

347
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:47,320
Symbian, Open Moco, Maemo, Neo 9000, Moblin, Limo, Bada, WebOS, Luna OS, MeeGo, Tizen,

348
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:52,560
Nemo Mobile, Sailfish OS, Asteroid, Yala, Zipper, Ubuntu Touch, KDE Plasma Mobile, Gnome

349
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,960
for Mobile, Replicant, Cyanogen Mod, Firefox OS.

350
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,280
I could go on and on.

351
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,820
These are all projects that have failed to reach mass adoption, and some of them have

352
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,840
failed completely, and most of them actually have failed completely outright, because they

353
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,880
couldn't see past their own visions.

354
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,760
You know, this whole project was about producing a phone that runs completely free software

355
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,400
and doesn't require blobs to run, right?

356
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,760
And they seem to have the hardware sorted on that, and they're doing some testing and

357
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,680
stuff, so that's all well and good, I think.

358
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,640
That's not that difficult once you get the system on a chip sorted.

359
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:32,840
And so it occurs to me, why don't they just take Lineage and use that and bundle F-Droid

360
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
with it?

361
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,840
Right.

362
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,920
And then you've got a completely blob-less Lineage phone, which would solve the problem.

363
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,360
No, I think within the company, there's people who are anti-Android, and more power to them,

364
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,360
that's all good.

365
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,100
That is what their customer base will do.

366
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,080
If they still manage to actually ship the hardware, nobody's going to buy that phone

367
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,200
and want to run some half-breed OS.

368
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,960
They're just going to reflash it to a usable operating system designed for mobile, and

369
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,180
then they probably won't get to take advantage of their physical kill switches, because Android

370
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:04,320
hasn't been built to just lose its baseband and its Wi-Fi chipset all of a sudden.

371
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,200
So that'll probably be something that only PureOS can do that most of the customer base

372
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,120
likely won't take advantage of, because they won't be running it.

373
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,520
Yeah, well, I was speaking to a developer from UbiPorts about it, and he said to me

374
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,800
that it's not as easy as you'd think, just because GNU slash Linux will run on it.

375
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,720
It doesn't necessarily mean that Android will.

376
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,360
And I made the point to him, well, yeah, but porting Android to it is surely easier and

377
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,360
cheaper than writing an entire operating system from scratch, which is what they're looking

378
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,360
to do.

379
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
Yeah.

380
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,800
And I can see this anti-Android stuff, but there's no reason to be anti-Android if you

381
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,960
run in lineage, which is totally free software, apart from the blobs that you normally need,

382
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,480
which you won't need in this case.

383
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:52,120
So there's no reason why you couldn't have a totally free replicant-style Android distribution.

384
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,420
I think it's about getting the blessing of the Free Software Foundation, quite honestly.

385
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,040
That I think they hope to be their competitive advantage of this phone.

386
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,840
Yeah, but isn't replicant blessed by the FSF?

387
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,840
Oh, I guess.

388
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
I think it is.

389
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
Yeah, I think they could do replicant.

390
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Yeah.

391
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
I think they could do replicant.

392
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Well, there you go.

393
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,840
Yeah.

394
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,400
I don't mean to not seem past the vision here.

395
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,680
To me, the idea that they're going to ship Plasma and Gnome, and that they're going to

396
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,020
invest equally in both of them and bring Gnome...

397
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,120
Even getting Gnome to where Plasma Mobile now is, is probably more work than somebody

398
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,800
who's also trying to build a phone at the same time should take on.

399
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
Yeah.

400
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,280
The fact that they can't see this is going to be noticed by the community.

401
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,820
Their average customer is a little more savvy than the person that's walking into a mobile

402
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,260
store and getting an Android phone for free.

403
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,000
We will see these red flags.

404
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,160
This will not go unnoticed.

405
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
I don't know, man.

406
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,440
I think that a lot of the people who have backed this and spent their money, they've

407
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,400
got so much hope in this that maybe they will see past these red flags and hope will keep

408
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,000
burning inside.

409
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,340
That is why I'm worried they're going to kill a certain kind of dream when this thing blows

410
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,340
up in their face.

411
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:05,200
Well, we'll still have UbiPorts after that, and I think that they've got some big things

412
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,920
happening this year with the Unbox stuff and Android app support.

413
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,700
I think that if they can get their marketing together and get the technical details of

414
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:22,640
it all worked out, I think that UbiPorts is going to be really one to watch and potentially

415
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,560
will end up on this Purism phone.

416
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,080
They might just have to, if they want to ship it in early 2019, then they might just have

417
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,800
to abandon what they're doing and just stick UbiPorts on it.

418
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,200
Well I hope one feature that remains is calls being placed over Matrix.

419
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
I love Matrix.

420
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,680
I like to think of it as communications infrastructure.

421
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,080
Yeah, well, it's looking pretty good for them.

422
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,960
They've had an investment of $5 million this week from Status.

423
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,600
An Ethereum-based company, right?

424
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,040
Isn't Stasis, aren't they like an Ethereum-based platform with chat and all that kind of...

425
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
I don't know.

426
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,040
I didn't see this coming, I guess.

427
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,920
Yeah, it seems like they'd be almost a competitor really, but well, Matrix is free software.

428
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,540
It's getting a lot of money thrown at it.

429
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,800
That's got to be good news, isn't it?

430
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,400
Yeah, in fact, one of the things they plan to do, they hope to do in the future, is build

431
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,280
a bridge from Matrix to the Status Ethereum chat system.

432
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,040
So that kind of makes sense.

433
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,340
And Status at the same time also invested in Rocket.im on the same day.

434
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,340
Same amount of money.

435
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,880
And Rocket.im rides on top of Matrix.

436
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,520
It's sort of like a Slack competitor.

437
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:32,520
And so Status.im has invested in both Matrix and the most popular front end, Rocket.im.

438
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,760
Yeah, that blockchain VC money is going to a good home here, at least.

439
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,360
Speaking of crypto funds going to a good home, the Free Software Foundation just got a big

440
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,360
Bitcoin donation.

441
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,680
Yeah, which was a million dollars worth, but now it's probably worth about 50 cents or

442
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
something.

443
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,680
It hurts.

444
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,120
It hurts, Joe.

445
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:57,920
As we record right now, Bitcoin has just broken below $8,000.

446
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,680
It's down $1,000 today.

447
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,000
It's at $7,983.

448
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,320
Now I always base my floors on what I feel like the gut of the Bitcoin community is.

449
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,040
And I told you, I think two days ago, I feel like the floor is 7,000 cold.

450
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,600
We'll see if I'm right about that.

451
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,720
I do have a theory on what's going on now.

452
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,960
Like I've sat back and watched it for a little bit.

453
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:27,000
And I think what we're seeing is the result of a pump and dump in altcoins.

454
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,120
People were using altcoins to buy Bitcoin and back and forth, and that fizzled out.

455
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,800
And now you're seeing a collapse in the Bitcoin price.

456
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:40,080
Now this is, as of right now, I think it's like around a 65% correction from the last

457
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,080
three months.

458
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,800
So it's gone up like 500%.

459
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,640
And now we're seeing a 65% correction.

460
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,000
So we're about at mid to early November prices right now.

461
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,120
Yeah, I've given up on trying to predict where it's going to go.

462
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,160
I just watch it, and my few hundred quid's worth goes up and down.

463
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,160
And I just have to be zen about it, really.

464
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,360
I've never invested too much in it.

465
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:10,360
But I wonder to what extent, because it's not just Bitcoin that's crashing and tanking,

466
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,560
it's the other cryptocurrencies, the altcoins, as you say.

467
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:21,280
And I wonder to what extent that is driven not by this stuff in India and Facebook banning

468
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,480
adverts for cryptocurrencies.

469
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,480
I wonder how much of it is being driven by deep fakes.

470
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,200
Because there's a lot of people, a lot of nerdy people, who probably were mining altcoins

471
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,520
before, who are now using their graphics cards to make these deep fakes, which are not necessarily

472
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,520
celebrity things.

473
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,800
Some of them are just fun things like Nicolas Cage or whatever.

474
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,600
The cryptocurrencies were something that a lot of people like you got into just for the

475
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,600
fun of it, wasn't it?

476
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,640
Just for something to do.

477
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,040
You had the hardware, so why not?

478
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,160
And now people are starting to do these.

479
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,600
I don't think that that has massively affected the price of Bitcoin, but it's interesting

480
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:01,100
to think about that maybe people are starting to move on to other things that need powerful

481
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,100
graphics cards.

482
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:07,360
Yeah, I also think people are moving on to some altcoins that are more approachable by

483
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,400
people with more common hardware.

484
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,180
And that could be playing a bit of a role.

485
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:15,600
It's usually several things that really cause large price manipulations, including people

486
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,400
intentionally manipulating the price at the same time.

487
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,280
So here's how I put the whole cryptocurrency market into perspective is I look at their

488
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,600
market caps, and it's kind of astonishing, really.

489
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,800
It starts out pretty strong, Bitcoin's way up there, then Ethereum comes in as like the

490
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,340
number two with the largest market cap.

491
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,760
And right now, Ethereum is $800 around there, it's around $813 for Ethereum.

492
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,560
Number three in market cap is Ripple, and it's worth 80 cents right now.

493
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,520
You go from $800 to 80 cents.

494
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:50,320
Now there's other outliers in there like NEO and Bitcoin Cash and a few others.

495
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,520
But it's really only the two top cryptocurrencies that are really worth anything in terms of

496
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,240
the coin dollar.

497
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,160
After that, it drops off dramatic.

498
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,800
Now there's still like millions of dollars of market value in some of these coins.

499
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,080
But they're being used at lower levels as more like back end currencies.

500
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,120
Yeah, it's interesting times, but we were supposed to be talking about the Free Software

501
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
Foundation.

502
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
Right.

503
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,960
And it's good to see that they've got this injection.

504
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:19,080
I don't know if they sold it or whether they're holding because it could end up being worth

505
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,240
a lot more for them, potentially, if they do hold and leave it a year or so.

506
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,480
If my original prediction was right, that it's going to be worth 100,000.

507
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:31,120
That's looking very unlikely at this point, but you never know.

508
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,520
Yeah, that would be quite the rally.

509
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,280
Now they say that this is a record breaking charitable contribution of 91.45 Bitcoins

510
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,560
from the Pineapple Fund, which at the time, like Joe said, was a million.

511
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
I don't know.

512
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,360
I can't really say what they did with it.

513
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,680
But they feel vindicated, I think.

514
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:50,760
In this post, I think they see this as a real testament to the importance of the Free Software

515
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,840
Foundation and free software in general.

516
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,240
And they say they're honored to receive this generous donation from the Pineapple Fund.

517
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
That's pretty awesome.

518
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,600
Yeah, because the Pineapple Fund has donated to a lot of really good causes.

519
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,880
So it's good to see that free software is part of it because after all, Bitcoin itself

520
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,040
is free software, isn't it?

521
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,520
So it's kind of it feels fitting.

522
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,240
