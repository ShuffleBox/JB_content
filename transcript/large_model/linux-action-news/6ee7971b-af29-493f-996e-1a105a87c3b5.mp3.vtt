00:00.000 --> 00:09.280
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 157, recorded on October 3rd, 2020.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.280
I'm Chris.

00:10.280 --> 00:11.280
And I'm Joe.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.280
Hello, Joe.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.280
Good to be connected with you.

00:13.280 --> 00:16.160
And we start this week with our own October surprise.

00:16.160 --> 00:21.280
It seems some open source developers are not really enjoying DigitalOcean's Hacktoberfest

00:21.280 --> 00:25.480
this year, and they claim they're drowning in spam pull requests.

00:25.480 --> 00:30.840
Now full disclosure, DigitalOcean does sponsor one of my shows, but I do think this is a

00:30.840 --> 00:34.120
little bit unfair on them.

00:34.120 --> 00:37.760
A lot of people have been pretty hostile to DigitalOcean about this.

00:37.760 --> 00:45.280
And I do think that the whole Hacktoberfest thing is them trying to do good for the community

00:45.280 --> 00:49.040
and obviously promote their business at the same time.

00:49.040 --> 00:53.880
I think it's just sort of naivety rather than malice that's caused this problem.

00:53.880 --> 00:55.320
This has been going on for a while.

00:55.320 --> 00:59.920
This is the seventh Hacktoberfest that originally launched in 2014.

00:59.920 --> 01:04.240
And the setup works is you get a certain kind of pull request in and a certain kind of window

01:04.240 --> 01:07.360
of time and you get swag.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.300
This year, things are a little different.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.080
First of all, I suppose you have more people at home.

01:11.080 --> 01:14.120
So there's maybe more people that are participating, I guess.

01:14.120 --> 01:19.120
But the other thing that's certain is DigitalOcean limited the amount of shirts that would be

01:19.120 --> 01:21.240
issued to something like 70,000 or 40,000.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.960
I mean, just some incredible number.

01:23.960 --> 01:27.520
But it meant there was a limited amount you could get, so you better get on it.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.080
I think it's important to kind of keep the numbers in perspective here.

01:30.080 --> 01:35.280
What we're talking about is some projects that are getting spam pull requests in the

01:35.280 --> 01:41.320
range of a dozen or so, and in the worst case, maybe a dozen or so a day, when the register

01:41.320 --> 01:48.200
looked into it, they saw that there was currently 1,136 pull requests that seemed to be related

01:48.200 --> 01:49.980
to the Hacktoberfest.

01:49.980 --> 01:51.640
That was as of October 1st.

01:51.640 --> 01:54.580
So it's not a tsunami, as some are calling it.

01:54.580 --> 01:55.580
But it's enough.

01:55.580 --> 01:59.500
And when you consider that each one of those then sends off generally a notification email

01:59.500 --> 02:03.560
to everyone who's watching the repository, and then each one of them might come to check

02:03.560 --> 02:07.880
on the status of it, it does actually add up very quickly into lost time.

02:07.880 --> 02:12.920
And this is something that I've not really figured out how to talk about.

02:12.920 --> 02:17.620
Because I think this is a really common problem in free software, is really well-intentioned

02:17.620 --> 02:24.000
people that have reach attempt to do something good and help projects, but what they really

02:24.000 --> 02:26.760
do is kind of DDoS the project.

02:26.760 --> 02:32.020
And DigitalOcean didn't name names, but they said an online influencer kind of put a little

02:32.020 --> 02:37.360
extra attention on this this year, one individual in particular, and they think that kind of

02:37.360 --> 02:40.640
snowballed and created a lot of momentum.

02:40.640 --> 02:45.560
And they were all well-intentioned, but it creates extra work for these projects.

02:45.560 --> 02:49.680
And I think it's easy to accidentally generate a lot of work for these maintainers.

02:49.680 --> 02:53.240
Yeah, and this is not the only instance of this that we've seen.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.320
We've seen other people with reach do that very same thing.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.980
They have good intentions.

02:57.980 --> 03:00.340
They are a little naive about it.

03:00.340 --> 03:06.340
And they put out there into the community that these open source projects need help

03:06.340 --> 03:08.800
via pull requests or bug reports.

03:08.800 --> 03:15.000
But those bug reports and pull requests have to be of good quality, otherwise, they are

03:15.000 --> 03:19.160
worse than not having them in the first place, as we're seeing here with what's being marked

03:19.160 --> 03:20.400
as spam.

03:20.400 --> 03:26.040
And the projects need the personnel and staffing to actually address the problems.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.860
And generally, there's already a long list of problems.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.960
It's more about actually getting the work done.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.320
But that's a complicated problem.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.040
We could probably do an entire show.

03:34.040 --> 03:39.800
The important takeaway from this is after kind of initial, not really understanding

03:39.800 --> 03:42.880
seeming response from DigitalOcean, they now have made good.

03:42.880 --> 03:46.320
And they've made this a you have to opt in to participate.

03:46.320 --> 03:51.080
So you have to add their Hacktoberfest metadata to your repository to make it clear that you

03:51.080 --> 03:53.120
want to participate.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.720
And so instead of it being opt out, it is now opt in.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.480
And so they'll probably end up with a warehouse full of t shirts then.

03:58.480 --> 04:03.760
Better get back to in person events so they can do something with those shirts.

04:03.760 --> 04:06.960
There's also a tool out there that GitHub has released to help you clean some of this

04:06.960 --> 04:07.960
stuff up.

04:07.960 --> 04:10.880
If this has been an issue for you, we'll have some resources in the show notes to help you

04:10.880 --> 04:11.880
out.

04:11.880 --> 04:16.440
But ultimately, this does show that DigitalOcean do listen to the community.

04:16.440 --> 04:21.640
It took them a few days to sort this out, but it seems to be a solution that most people

04:21.640 --> 04:22.640
are happy with now.

04:22.640 --> 04:27.960
I think it's worth noting, maybe more people know how to do this now.

04:27.960 --> 04:31.440
And getting more people involved and just being aware that these are open source projects

04:31.440 --> 04:35.640
that you can contribute to, and this is how you submit PRs, and this is this is how you

04:35.640 --> 04:38.640
interface, that has to have some value.

04:38.640 --> 04:44.200
I don't know if it equals the cost of the time of these very limited time of these developers.

04:44.200 --> 04:49.440
But I hope there is some long term benefit of the network effect of DigitalOcean's Hacktoberfest,

04:49.440 --> 04:53.120
bringing people into the ecosystem and teaching them some of the basics.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.120
And it's a good motivator.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.840
Free stuff, turns out, motivates people to learn.

04:56.840 --> 05:01.760
Yeah, and if nothing else, hopefully this has put a spotlight on the quality of pull

05:01.760 --> 05:07.800
requests and just changing a few commas in a readme is not actually very useful.

05:07.800 --> 05:11.920
And now people will hopefully realize that, people who are new to this community.

05:11.920 --> 05:17.220
Well, Google made news this week with a brand new Chromecast that now comes with something

05:17.220 --> 05:23.080
called Google TV, which is not Google TV as you knew it, but is now better summarized

05:23.080 --> 05:26.880
as an experience that runs on a upgraded Chromecast device.

05:26.880 --> 05:30.900
Yeah, this came out of the Pixel 5 online event this week.

05:30.900 --> 05:32.740
Now I don't own a TV.

05:32.740 --> 05:35.480
So this is all just alien to me.

05:35.480 --> 05:36.920
It's very confusing.

05:36.920 --> 05:43.080
And having read about it, it's still a little confusing to me exactly what is Google TV,

05:43.080 --> 05:46.320
what's Android TV, and how it all fits together.

05:46.320 --> 05:47.320
Yeah.

05:47.320 --> 05:52.240
And as somebody who loves his Nvidia Shield, I was concerned what this meant for the future.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.200
But I think I have it figured out.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.840
This is maybe not a fair, fair comparison.

05:56.840 --> 06:01.520
But think of Google TV as a launcher that will now sit on top of the Android TV operating

06:01.520 --> 06:02.520
system.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.800
This is a new experience that uses Android TV underneath.

06:05.800 --> 06:09.320
The Google TV project as it was, the thing that was featured on the Nexus Player and

06:09.320 --> 06:11.220
whatnot is no longer.

06:11.220 --> 06:16.300
But they've taken some of the ideas from the UI experience and brought them forward.

06:16.300 --> 06:20.840
It's now much more tightly integrated with Google Assistant and much more tightly integrated

06:20.840 --> 06:24.620
with their streaming partners, Apple TV Plus aside.

06:24.620 --> 06:28.520
And it puts all of that content front and center along with YouTube TV Live.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.920
It's now just a tab on there.

06:29.920 --> 06:37.320
And it's like this souped up interface that now comes shipped on a 50-ish, $60 Chromecast.

06:37.320 --> 06:41.200
Alex from the self-hosted podcast already has one and he's already experimenting with

06:41.200 --> 06:42.200
it.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.240
So I think on an upcoming episode soon, we'll get his review.

06:44.240 --> 06:45.960
I look forward to that.

06:45.960 --> 06:50.000
But it's interesting that it doesn't support Stadia at launch.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.720
That is coming soon, early next year probably.

06:53.720 --> 06:57.740
What does that tell you about Stadia as a priority for Google?

06:57.740 --> 06:59.440
It can't be very high for them.

06:59.440 --> 07:03.840
I think what it really betrays is how they fail internally to support each other and

07:03.840 --> 07:06.440
how isolated these different projects are.

07:06.440 --> 07:13.440
I would bet you a cider that Google TV as an experience was its own siloed project completely

07:13.440 --> 07:18.180
separate off and doing its own thing that has now come along and they just never interface

07:18.180 --> 07:19.560
properly with the Stadia team.

07:19.560 --> 07:24.320
And so they have this embarrassing missing feature that any other provider would never

07:24.320 --> 07:29.040
ship a platform like this and not put their absolute latest and greatest streaming services

07:29.040 --> 07:30.040
front and center.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.280
It's laughable when you actually break it down like that.

07:32.280 --> 07:36.440
But it just seems to be Google's failure to function internally and maybe why they don't

07:36.440 --> 07:39.100
properly support these products at the end of the day.

07:39.100 --> 07:42.700
And I'm not very thrilled so far with the early implementation.

07:42.700 --> 07:49.800
It seems from what I've gathered from Alex and the audience that Plex, Ambi, Kodi, they

07:49.800 --> 07:53.000
don't get to participate in this new Google TV UI.

07:53.000 --> 07:58.540
They're now just apps that you have to go into and their data is an island onto themselves

07:58.540 --> 08:02.000
siloed off inside somewhere in the UI.

08:02.000 --> 08:07.240
But Hulu Plus and Disney Plus of course that's all front and centered and of course YouTube

08:07.240 --> 08:09.200
TV that's integrated throughout.

08:09.200 --> 08:13.160
And so the streaming partners and the services that I really don't want to buy all of them

08:13.160 --> 08:16.480
so I'm not going to use them all are now just front and center.

08:16.480 --> 08:20.760
And my apps that I want to get to the actual library that I've now invested almost a decade

08:20.760 --> 08:28.840
into well that's buried one, two, three, four, five tabs down now and inside siloed off not

08:28.840 --> 08:31.140
integrated with the rest of the experience.

08:31.140 --> 08:36.560
And I don't think it's clear today what Google has planned to address that if Plex and Ambi

08:36.560 --> 08:40.880
and Kodi can update and take advantage of the UI or if they have to be a streaming partner

08:40.880 --> 08:42.440
and they'll never be part of it.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.440
It's not clear right now.

08:43.440 --> 08:49.560
But there is some good news regarding Google TV and that is that the recent WireGuard update

08:49.560 --> 08:53.800
supports it and is very easy to use by the sounds of things.

08:53.800 --> 08:58.520
If you want to hop on your VPN to pretend that you're in a different country for Netflix

08:58.520 --> 08:59.520
or whatever.

08:59.520 --> 09:06.600
This is so cool to have something like WireGuard that is not only making the Android TV app

09:06.600 --> 09:11.120
which I am super grateful for but it seems like they're also going out of their way to

09:11.120 --> 09:17.000
try to make it the best experience on a stock unrooted device or on a fully rooted device.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.040
They seem to make accommodations for either and give you the best experience and that's

09:20.040 --> 09:23.520
awesome to see the developers going out of their way to accommodate that.

09:23.520 --> 09:27.740
And having this integrated at the TV level, that's so awesome because you could take something

09:27.740 --> 09:28.740
like the Shield with you.

09:28.740 --> 09:32.160
They have like a more portable little tube version now.

09:32.160 --> 09:36.200
You could take something like that with you to a hotel, plug it into the hotel television

09:36.200 --> 09:38.040
when that becomes a thing again.

09:38.040 --> 09:43.480
Or like you said for region hopping or for a guy like me who has a lot of stuff archived

09:43.480 --> 09:48.520
at the studio, I could just VPN into the studio, get access to all the stuff stored on there

09:48.520 --> 09:53.280
without having to open up any ports to the internet, keeping it all private and secure.

09:53.280 --> 09:58.160
The only other thing now I need to really make life complete would be a really simple

09:58.160 --> 10:02.840
way to download YouTube videos and store them on the Android TV so I could watch them offline.

10:02.840 --> 10:06.800
You combine all this together and it's nearly the perfect set top box.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.560
Does New Pipe not work with Android TV?

10:09.560 --> 10:10.560
I don't know.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.720
I've never tried New Pipe on the old Android TV.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.080
I'll definitely give it a go.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.720
I was hoping one day to find something that was a Kodi plugin because that'd be the perfect

10:17.720 --> 10:22.760
thing is a Kodi YouTube browser that downloads the YouTube videos and then adds them to the

10:22.760 --> 10:24.320
library for watching.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.440
That just seems like utopia, but I guess just Crazy Chris wants that.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.200
I'll definitely try out New Pipe though.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.880
If you do, I recommend getting it from GitHub rather than F-Droid.

10:32.880 --> 10:35.480
It depends who I'm recommending it to.

10:35.480 --> 10:39.800
If people aren't going to manually update it, then get it from F-Droid and you'll get

10:39.800 --> 10:45.040
notifications but someone like you who's going to be on it, I'd say get it from GitHub so

10:45.040 --> 10:46.720
you can get the absolute newest version.

10:46.720 --> 10:47.720
Oh yeah.

10:47.720 --> 10:48.720
You know that API.

10:48.720 --> 10:49.720
It's always changing.

10:49.720 --> 10:50.720
Yep.

10:50.720 --> 10:56.160
On the phone side of Android, we've had a clarification from Google this week about

10:56.160 --> 10:58.200
their in-app payment policy.

10:58.200 --> 11:03.320
They take a lot of this blog post to essentially boil it down to one point they make in here,

11:03.320 --> 11:08.260
which is, quote, we want to be sure our policies are clear and up to date so they can be applied

11:08.260 --> 11:10.520
consistently and fairly to all developers.

11:10.520 --> 11:15.760
So we have clarified the language in our payments policy to be more explicit that all developers

11:15.760 --> 11:21.760
selling digital goods in their apps are required to use Google Play's billing system.

11:21.760 --> 11:27.720
In other words, if you are doing in-app purchases, they're going to get their 30% cut.

11:27.720 --> 11:33.600
This essentially brings them more in line with the Apple App Store policy, but I think

11:33.600 --> 11:39.920
Google trying to project an image that's a little softer than what Apple does is offering

11:39.920 --> 11:45.360
an olive branch to developers in a sense, giving them a one-year grace period for developers

11:45.360 --> 11:47.180
to comply with the policy.

11:47.180 --> 11:50.480
This is clearly all about Epic and Fortnite, isn't it?

11:50.480 --> 11:55.960
This is their reaction to that whole case and trying to kind of weasel out of it because

11:55.960 --> 12:01.480
they also say, hey, look, you can have your apps on other app stores and a bunch of phones,

12:01.480 --> 12:06.280
most phones in fact, ship with at least two app stores on them already and there's nothing

12:06.280 --> 12:11.760
stopping you putting your app in there and you can advertise deals elsewhere, like via

12:11.760 --> 12:15.540
email or whatever, but just not via the Play Store.

12:15.540 --> 12:20.180
It's them trying to say that it's all far more open than Apple.

12:20.180 --> 12:26.240
It's an interesting position they're taking because it will strengthen Apple's fight.

12:26.240 --> 12:31.340
This is a win for Apple because Google's essentially aligning themselves with Apple's policy, which

12:31.340 --> 12:35.300
I think maybe the idea there is to strengthen Apple's position in their fight with Epic

12:35.300 --> 12:38.080
because Google is facing the same fight.

12:38.080 --> 12:41.360
They're making this move and they're doing it in a way that's gentler than how Apple

12:41.360 --> 12:42.360
does it.

12:42.360 --> 12:47.820
I love also in this just another kind of clever strategy of theirs is they're playing into

12:47.820 --> 12:49.320
fragmentation now.

12:49.320 --> 12:54.600
They're using fragmentation as a benefit saying, well, look, most of our phones ship with two

12:54.600 --> 12:56.400
app stores already.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.360
Isn't that great?

12:58.360 --> 13:00.580
Which is horrible, right?

13:00.580 --> 13:05.100
It's a mess and it probably means tons of crazy spam push notifications and probably

13:05.100 --> 13:09.460
means that unknown sources are checked by default and all kinds of junk, but they're

13:09.460 --> 13:15.600
able to now leverage that as an advantage in this particular argument while also simultaneously

13:15.600 --> 13:20.680
strengthening Apple's fight against Epic and thus their own, which is also pending.

13:20.680 --> 13:27.000
It's funny that just this very morning, my wife said to me, what's my Jisc manager and

13:27.000 --> 13:28.560
why does it want to update?

13:28.560 --> 13:32.880
And I said, oh yeah, that's how we get root and for the ad block thing.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.560
And she said, okay, so it wants me to give it permission.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.140
So okay, I've done that.

13:38.140 --> 13:39.140
Is that it?

13:39.140 --> 13:42.320
And I said, oh no, now you have to press back and then install it.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.320
She's like, what?

13:43.320 --> 13:46.680
That's just horrible, horrible user experience.

13:46.680 --> 13:52.540
And that is the complaint that the likes of Epic are throwing at Google that yes, technically

13:52.540 --> 13:58.200
you can sideload APKs, which is essentially what we're talking about with other app stores,

13:58.200 --> 14:00.620
but it's not as smooth as the Play Store.

14:00.620 --> 14:02.740
You can't have silent automatic updates.

14:02.740 --> 14:06.320
You're always going to get a prompt and it's always going to say things that sound a little

14:06.320 --> 14:10.760
bit like you probably shouldn't be doing this and you're kind of taking risks.

14:10.760 --> 14:15.640
And so I'm not really buying it that it is a level playing field for all app stores because

14:15.640 --> 14:17.040
it just isn't.

14:17.040 --> 14:21.000
And Google are now saying that in Android 12, which will be coming next year, they're

14:21.000 --> 14:26.720
going to make it easier to install applications from third party app stores while also being

14:26.720 --> 14:27.720
secure.

14:27.720 --> 14:28.720
They're going to make that happen.

14:28.720 --> 14:29.720
But that's what they're saying.

14:29.720 --> 14:34.080
Well, I'm going to your point about not buying what they're selling here.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.620
I kind of have that issue to surprise, surprise.

14:36.620 --> 14:40.820
I feel almost like they're patronizing developers in a sense.

14:40.820 --> 14:45.640
The post where they announced that you're going to pay your cut is titled, quote, listening

14:45.640 --> 14:50.160
to developer feedback to improve Google Play, which is a bunch of news speak if I've ever

14:50.160 --> 14:51.300
seen any.

14:51.300 --> 14:56.800
But then there's this actual section that they have completely like its own paragraph

14:56.800 --> 14:59.040
with its own title called equal treatment.

14:59.040 --> 15:04.560
And it reads, our policies apply equally to all apps distributed on Google Play, including

15:04.560 --> 15:06.280
Google's own apps.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.120
Well, that's also a bunch of horse shit.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.520
That's not believable at all.

15:10.520 --> 15:17.120
They, first of all, don't have to pay in an app penalty because they are Google.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.000
It's not any kind of equal playing ground.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.080
They're often automatically updated and shipped through the Play Store.

15:22.080 --> 15:27.720
They ship on the device to claim that Google's own apps are held to the same standards and

15:27.720 --> 15:33.960
go and follow the same promotional guidelines and follow the same in-app purchases is just

15:33.960 --> 15:36.680
obviously disingenuous on its face.

15:36.680 --> 15:39.320
This whole thing feels disingenuous to me.

15:39.320 --> 15:46.720
It feels like Google just trying to set themselves up for this legal battle against Epic.

15:46.720 --> 15:50.600
They're just trying to lay the groundwork to say, hey, look, no, we're totally open

15:50.600 --> 15:53.160
and we're giving developers a chance.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.320
So don't sue us.

15:55.320 --> 15:56.320
Sue Apple.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.960
I don't agree with you that they're aligning with Apple.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.840
I think they're trying to distance themselves from Apple.

16:01.840 --> 16:06.160
A lot of the language here is very much saying that we're open and stuff.

16:06.160 --> 16:09.120
So I think they're just trying to throw Apple under the bus.

16:09.120 --> 16:10.780
I think you're buying what they're selling.

16:10.780 --> 16:13.800
Google always, always drapes it in this language.

16:13.800 --> 16:18.800
But when you look at the functional result of what's actually being done here, they're

16:18.800 --> 16:23.280
essentially just implementing, they're taking Apple's App Store policy and now it's just

16:23.280 --> 16:24.800
the industry standard.

16:24.800 --> 16:27.080
They're just implementing the same stuff.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.680
Yeah, but officially they were implementing that before.

16:29.680 --> 16:33.880
They were quite lax on it and it was only when there was a big play like Epic that they

16:33.880 --> 16:36.600
went after them and kicked them out of the store.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.680
But ultimately that was the policy before.

16:38.680 --> 16:40.520
Now they've just tightened it up a little bit.

16:40.520 --> 16:41.520
Right.

16:41.520 --> 16:44.320
Although if they wanted to distance themselves, they could have come out today and said, we've

16:44.320 --> 16:49.100
partnered with Stripe and now Stripe will be available as an in-app payment option to

16:49.100 --> 16:54.920
Android developers and you can take, you know, you'll keep 90% of the revenue.

16:54.920 --> 16:59.440
We now have new options for Android developers because Google supports open payment systems.

16:59.440 --> 17:02.520
Well, yeah, but they obviously wouldn't do that because then they're going to miss out

17:02.520 --> 17:03.960
on a bunch of money.

17:03.960 --> 17:06.200
That 30% is a lot of money.

17:06.200 --> 17:11.680
There's not that many developers and that many apps charging, but I think the ones that

17:11.680 --> 17:16.160
are charging money are charging a lot in aggregate with all their users.

17:16.160 --> 17:21.680
Well, and here's the beauty now is both Google's lawyers and Apple's lawyers can point to each

17:21.680 --> 17:25.720
other and say, look, we both had terms of service.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.280
Epic agreed to those terms of services.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.960
Then they broke them intentionally.

17:29.960 --> 17:33.040
Both of our app stores are aligned on this issue.

17:33.040 --> 17:37.400
This is a standard problem and Epic knew it going in for both of them.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.400
He's doing it.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.400
We're doing it.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.400
Epic's the one in the wrong.

17:40.400 --> 17:45.040
I mean, either way, this is a loss for Epic and probably a loss for end users that were

17:45.040 --> 17:49.540
hoping on Epic making this crack on the iOS platform that may force sideloading or some

17:49.540 --> 17:51.800
other unbelievable result.

17:51.800 --> 17:55.760
I think those hopes have all pretty much been crushed by this alignment of policies.

17:55.760 --> 17:56.760
I disagree.

17:56.760 --> 18:00.320
Maybe I'm buying what Google's selling here, but I do see this distinction.

18:00.320 --> 18:04.080
I think that they're saying, yes, that is the policy in the Play Store, but you have

18:04.080 --> 18:05.760
alternatives.

18:05.760 --> 18:11.320
And I think ultimately, we may see Apple being forced to allow sideloading.

18:11.320 --> 18:15.880
I think it would probably not be a great thing in terms of security if they did that.

18:15.880 --> 18:19.760
But I think that we could see that on the iPhone.

18:19.760 --> 18:24.740
I don't think anything will change on Android because you can already sideload in theory

18:24.740 --> 18:26.440
if you jump through a few hoops.

18:26.440 --> 18:32.000
I'll say this to Google's credit if Android 12 ships and they've made good on their promise

18:32.000 --> 18:35.560
to make it easier to install apps from third party stores.

18:35.560 --> 18:41.240
And that experience is close to first class, then I'd say that's at least enabling a different

18:41.240 --> 18:44.640
app store with its own rules and its own cuts to be competitive.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.320
And that's absolutely better than nothing.

18:46.320 --> 18:51.160
In fact, if that's actually viable, say the Amazon app store or whatever could be like

18:51.160 --> 18:56.760
a serious contender on Android and really be good and be well integrated, then that

18:56.760 --> 19:00.880
really is more choice and Google can do whatever it wants with the Play Store.

19:00.880 --> 19:03.520
Somehow I don't think they're going to be quite equal though, are they?

19:03.520 --> 19:07.160
Even after these changes in Android 12.

19:07.160 --> 19:10.480
Jupiter Broadcasting has sponsor openings in October.

19:10.480 --> 19:15.000
We are the largest, longest running Linux podcast in the world, and now we're independent

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
again.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.320
We have an opportunity for the right sponsor to reach the perfect audience.

19:19.320 --> 19:22.440
They're technical, they're informed, and they want to get things done.

19:22.440 --> 19:26.920
And more than ever, there's an opportunity to invest in a proven performer and get your

19:26.920 --> 19:29.580
product or service featured in our shows.

19:29.580 --> 19:32.840
From the community to the community, it's a pretty great opportunity to support the

19:32.840 --> 19:36.440
content we love and get your business and services featured.

19:36.440 --> 19:40.320
Let's make this next evolution of Jupiter Broadcasting even better together.

19:40.320 --> 19:41.320
Let's grow together.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.860
Email me, chris at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

19:43.860 --> 19:50.220
If you're interested in sponsoring, it's chris at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

19:50.220 --> 19:55.240
As predicted and to no one's surprise, Google's search preference menu has eliminated Duck

19:55.240 --> 19:57.040
Duck Go in its latest round.

19:57.040 --> 20:01.600
Yeah, this is Google's browser ballot, which was their response to the European Commission

20:01.600 --> 20:05.120
ruling that they had a monopoly on search in Android.

20:05.120 --> 20:10.420
So if you get a new Android device in Europe, you're going to be faced with this selection

20:10.420 --> 20:11.420
menu.

20:11.420 --> 20:16.040
I remember at the time when this was first announced, we talked about it and it didn't

20:16.040 --> 20:17.680
seem quite right.

20:17.680 --> 20:22.240
There's a sealed bidding process where search engines say how much they're willing to pay

20:22.240 --> 20:25.120
per user who selects them.

20:25.120 --> 20:29.080
And it's Google making money from something that maybe they oughtn't to be making money

20:29.080 --> 20:30.080
from.

20:30.080 --> 20:34.360
I had all their excuses at the time, but it never quite sat well with me.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.840
Surprise, surprise.

20:35.840 --> 20:39.600
The way things have shaked out is Duck Duck Go didn't win.

20:39.600 --> 20:46.300
And it seems that it encourages the companies that do win to up their ad spends to then

20:46.300 --> 20:48.880
make the money to place bids to win this.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.800
And Duck Duck Go isn't really holding anything back.

20:51.800 --> 20:56.140
And on their website, they write, our most recent large sample user testing shows that

20:56.140 --> 21:01.020
when a search preference menu is displayed and designed properly, then Google's search

21:01.020 --> 21:05.960
mobile market could drop immediately by 20%.

21:05.960 --> 21:09.080
So they think Google's intentionally not designing this thing right.

21:09.080 --> 21:13.720
And they say Duck Duck Go, despite being the go to Google alternative that consumers most

21:13.720 --> 21:18.080
want to select, will no longer even appear in most countries.

21:18.080 --> 21:22.520
As a result, many EU residents buying a new Android device will no longer have an easy

21:22.520 --> 21:24.680
way to adopt a private search engine.

21:24.680 --> 21:31.120
The central problem with Google's search preference menu is that it is pay to play.

21:31.120 --> 21:34.280
And only the highest bidders are on the menu.

21:34.280 --> 21:38.560
And they say that the long term problem here is it incentivizes bad behavior.

21:38.560 --> 21:43.060
It incentivizes these search engines to do things to up ad revenue that essentially make

21:43.060 --> 21:44.760
them less private for consumers.

21:44.760 --> 21:47.240
Yeah, and I do have a lot of sympathy for them.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.320
But what can they do?

21:48.320 --> 21:53.640
They're calling on the European Commission to say, look, you haven't complied properly,

21:53.640 --> 21:56.040
which I'm inclined to agree with.

21:56.040 --> 22:00.800
But Google has a lot of lawyers, and they pay them a lot of money.

22:00.800 --> 22:05.320
And somehow, I can't see anything changing here.

22:05.320 --> 22:09.000
They did just enough to comply.

22:09.000 --> 22:14.200
And the European Commission are not known for their speed when it comes to bureaucracy.

22:14.200 --> 22:18.360
So even if Duck Duck Go does manage to get them to change anything, it's going to take

22:18.360 --> 22:20.960
a long time for it to happen.

22:20.960 --> 22:25.440
And in the meantime, Duck Duck Go is just out in the cold, essentially.

22:25.440 --> 22:29.760
And at the end of the day, has Google done anything wrong?

22:29.760 --> 22:32.760
Perhaps Duck Duck Go just didn't bid enough.

22:32.760 --> 22:35.120
And so someone was willing to spend more.

22:35.120 --> 22:38.400
Now Duck Duck Go says that's bad for the ecosystem.

22:38.400 --> 22:44.460
But I think Google could argue that it's fair play because this is first class placement

22:44.460 --> 22:45.460
on their operating system.

22:45.460 --> 22:49.840
You know, it would have been a lot easier if the world's largest search engine and ad

22:49.840 --> 22:54.520
agency didn't make the world's largest operating system.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.120
Things might have been a little bit simpler.

22:56.120 --> 23:02.760
Well, you said it would never happen, Joe, and I'm getting my Atari VCS, I think, soon,

23:02.760 --> 23:03.760
maybe.

23:03.760 --> 23:06.400
Soon TM, yeah.

23:06.400 --> 23:13.080
So on the Medium blog for the Atari VCS, they posted some pictures of the Atari VCS being

23:13.080 --> 23:18.080
made and in all the boxes getting ready to ship.

23:18.080 --> 23:21.080
But people are very skeptical about this.

23:21.080 --> 23:28.920
And they are the most cliche fundraiser, we're shipping photos.

23:28.920 --> 23:30.840
You never seen more pictures of boxes.

23:30.840 --> 23:33.840
I looked into my Indiegogo records.

23:33.840 --> 23:37.960
It looks like I bought mine on June 3rd, 2018, which I thought it was sooner than that.

23:37.960 --> 23:45.080
But that's according to Indiegogo and my updated delivery date for my Atari VCS collector's

23:45.080 --> 23:50.280
edition is currently October 2020.

23:50.280 --> 23:51.480
Hang on.

23:51.480 --> 23:52.480
That's now.

23:52.480 --> 23:53.480
It's October 2020.

23:53.480 --> 23:54.760
Yeah, yeah.

23:54.760 --> 23:57.920
So that's recently been updated at Indiegogo.

23:57.920 --> 24:02.280
It didn't say that like three months ago when I logged in and checked it.

24:02.280 --> 24:06.320
We should say what this is for people who don't remember it from all those years ago.

24:06.320 --> 24:07.320
Right, right.

24:07.320 --> 24:13.080
This is a severely outdated game console that will have a custom Atari UI on top of it that

24:13.080 --> 24:16.400
will offer services that I'll likely not want to participate in.

24:16.400 --> 24:20.640
This is I mean, the idea is neat, right?

24:20.640 --> 24:26.540
It's a retro wood looking Atari type console that will have a retro inspired UI that brings

24:26.540 --> 24:31.760
together independent games and commercial games and has a somewhat compelling AMD platform

24:31.760 --> 24:33.760
that runs Ubuntu all under the hood.

24:33.760 --> 24:39.820
I mean, talk about checking all my boxes back in 2018.

24:39.820 --> 24:46.440
But now in 2020, when the PlayStation 5 has been announced and I have a Switch and I have

24:46.440 --> 24:51.360
an Nvidia Shield, I'm not really in a place where I even want this product anymore.

24:51.360 --> 24:56.180
I'm going to give it a full go and a review with an open mind because I got to be honest,

24:56.180 --> 24:59.800
if I could have a Linux box that looks like an awesome Atari console that can run Kodi

24:59.800 --> 25:05.140
and Plex and MB, I actually would probably consider taking out my Shield for that.

25:05.140 --> 25:09.720
So it may be a product I end up using, but it's not what I'm actively looking for right

25:09.720 --> 25:10.720
now.

25:10.720 --> 25:11.720
Yeah, but it's going to be x86 based.

25:11.720 --> 25:15.560
So it's going to use quite a lot of power, probably get quite hot.

25:15.560 --> 25:17.960
It's the kind of thing you could do with a Raspberry Pi quite easily.

25:17.960 --> 25:22.760
I don't think it's going to be able to do any modern games at all.

25:22.760 --> 25:29.600
You're going to be looking at maybe like 10 year plus old games and emulators and stuff,

25:29.600 --> 25:34.780
which the emulator side of things like your Nintendo and Sega and stuff.

25:34.780 --> 25:38.320
You can do all that on a Raspberry Pi easily for what?

25:38.320 --> 25:43.440
Like even a Raspberry Pi 3 would probably do that, no problem.

25:43.440 --> 25:46.880
So this just seems too expensive for what you're actually going to get.

25:46.880 --> 25:52.040
They have massively overpromised and well, they haven't even under delivered yet, have

25:52.040 --> 25:53.040
they?

25:53.040 --> 25:58.360
They haven't delivered anything and we'll, I'll believe it when it happens, but somehow

25:58.360 --> 26:03.240
I don't think you're going to be talking about it on Linux Unplugged or this show actually

26:03.240 --> 26:07.800
having used it before Christmas, but you know, I could be wrong.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.600
I mean, maybe I'll have it this month.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.600
Wouldn't that be something?

26:10.600 --> 26:16.480
If I come on the show sometime in October and I have it, I guess we'll find out.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.480
I agree.

26:17.480 --> 26:22.440
I think, I think the Raspberry Pi probably is pretty locked in for my use in Lady Joops

26:22.440 --> 26:26.160
because of its low power status, but there's room for it here.

26:26.160 --> 26:27.240
We shall see.

26:27.240 --> 26:31.760
There's room for me to love it, Joe, but it's not really the product I'm looking for today.

26:31.760 --> 26:36.760
But you know, in terms of game compatibility, none of that will matter because it'll probably

26:36.760 --> 26:39.720
get Stadia support before the new Chromecast does.

26:39.720 --> 26:40.720
Probably, yeah.

26:40.720 --> 26:44.280
Well, we'll keep an eye on it and of course, let you know, just go to linuxactionnews.com

26:44.280 --> 26:47.080
slash subscribe for all the ways to get new episodes.

26:47.080 --> 26:51.120
And linuxactionnews.com slash contact for ways to get in touch with us.

26:51.120 --> 26:55.160
If you love TechSnap Days of Old with Alan Jude or with Jim Salter, check out Two and

26:55.160 --> 26:56.520
a Half Admins.

26:56.520 --> 26:59.680
They have a new show with Joe, 2.5admins.com.

26:59.680 --> 27:04.160
Yeah, guess who the half admin is.

27:04.160 --> 27:07.920
We'll be back next Monday with our weekly take on the latest Linux and open source news.

27:07.920 --> 27:12.440
You can find me at chrislass.com and you can find me at joelress.com.

27:12.440 --> 27:15.240
Thanks for joining us and we'll see you next week.

27:15.240 --> 27:34.760
I'll talk to you later.
