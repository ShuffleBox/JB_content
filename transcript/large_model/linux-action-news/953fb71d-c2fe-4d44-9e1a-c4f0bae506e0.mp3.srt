00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,240
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,380
This is episode 54, recorded on May 20th, 2018.

3
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,380
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,380
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,380
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,640
You don't happen to be doing this week's episode from your watch.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,800
Not quite, but I have been playing with my smartwatch, which I've dug out of the drawer,

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,440
to play with Asteroid OS, which has reached version 1.0.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:43,620
And Asteroid OS is an alternative ROM for smartwatches that is Linux-based and completely

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,620
open source.

11
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,800
Yeah, you say Linux-based, I say it's based on some of the best.

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,660
It's the open embedded platform.

13
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:56,040
It's OpenPKG, Wayland, Qt 5, SystemD, BlueZ, and your favorite, Pulse Audio.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,840
Yeah, it's kind of like a proper Linux box on your wrist.

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,880
It's very strange that they even talk about being able to run Docker on it.

16
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,240
Yeah, that's my favorite part is if you want to run Docker on your watch, go for it.

17
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,260
It's pretty feature complete, at least in the screenshots, and the device range is pretty

18
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,260
complete as well.

19
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,680
It'll run on the LG G Watch, the LG G Watch Urbane, the LG G Watch R, the Asus ZenWatch

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,280
1 through 3, which I happen to have the ZenWatch 3, so I'm looking forward to that, and the

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,960
Sony SmartWatch 3.

22
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,920
So which in that batch did you have?

23
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,040
I have the Sony SmartWatch 3, which unfortunately is the one that is least well supported.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:40,620
There's no haptic, and it's a little bit buggy, which kind of sucks, but I used it

25
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,620
for a day, and it was great.

26
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:49,680
It's not as complete feature-wise as, say, Wear OS, which used to be called Android

27
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,480
Wear, but I don't need those apps and things.

28
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,200
All I need is notifications on my wrist, really.

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,300
The only thing it's missing on my particular watch is haptic, which is a kind of crucial

30
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,300
thing for me.

31
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,920
I want it to vibrate so I can then look at the watch, and if they could get that working

32
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,500
on my particular one, then I'd be all over this, and I'd be using it every day.

33
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,160
And is this syncing to your Android device using their companion app on your phone?

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,400
Yes, which I went looking for in the Play Store and couldn't find, and then, oh no,

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
it's in F-Droid.

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,760
Oh, that's a kind of win.

37
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,340
It's actually surprisingly complete for a 1.0 release.

38
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,640
It does support phone notifications, it has an alarm, a calculator, a music remote control,

39
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,560
a stopwatch, a timer, weather forecasts.

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,420
In addition to that, it's in 20 languages, which is pretty damn impressive for a 1.0,

41
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:49,380
and it comes with an SDK with examples and tutorials that help developers get started.

42
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,480
So I'm definitely going to throw it on the ZenWatch 3.

43
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,120
Yeah, and if you don't have one of the compatible watches, you can run it in an emulator.

44
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,920
I think even in QEMU, you can get it running.

45
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
So that's pretty cool.

46
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Right?

47
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,120
Yeah, that is another way to play around with this if you don't have a watch to load it

48
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,120
on.

49
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,920
It's just really impressive they've gotten this far in a 1.0, and it just keeps that

50
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:14,640
age-old truth alive in 2018 that you can put Linux on anything, and these watches are probably

51
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
ripe for it.

52
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,840
I'll be really excited to see where this project goes.

53
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,960
Yeah, you might say it's one to watch.

54
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,920
You had to do that.

55
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:29,760
Speaking of fails, eFail was big news this week, and it really kind of got advertised

56
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,400
as doom and gloom for OpenPGP and S-MIME.

57
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,600
In fact, the EFF went as far as saying, disable OpenPGP in your email client.

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Stop using it.

59
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,160
Yeah, it was kind of alarming what the EFF said about it, but having listened to Wes

60
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:49,000
and you talk about it on TechSnap, I'm a little bit less concerned now.

61
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,560
There are fairly straightforward ways to mitigate this.

62
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,160
Check out TechSnap.systems.368 for Wes's complete breakdown.

63
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,660
There is some things to consider, especially if you're using S-MIME or Enigmail, which

64
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,040
is probably the takeaway for our audience is Enigmail is somewhat impacted by this.

65
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,820
The researchers released a PDF with all of the email clients and services that are not

66
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:16,760
properly implementing a specific function of GNU PG called Modification Detection Code,

67
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,760
or MDC.

68
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,600
It's been a standard for almost 18 years, and that check would have prevented the automatic

69
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,840
decryption of emails that Enigmail is vulnerable to.

70
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,120
Now, you probably should disable HTML email for now, maybe disable Enigmail.

71
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,860
The safest bet is continue encrypting your email.

72
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,520
Just encrypt outside of your email client and decrypt outside your email client.

73
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,680
That is the best way to mitigate this, but that puts one more barrier up, and it means

74
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,400
that people are less likely to encrypt their emails, doesn't it?

75
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,920
Obviously there are people who have to encrypt them because they're in certain circumstances,

76
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,480
journalists and whistleblowers, that sort of thing, but isn't the goal to have everybody

77
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,440
encrypt their emails all the time?

78
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,600
This just makes it harder for people to do that.

79
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,480
I don't encrypt any of my emails, and I don't think you do, do you?

80
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,880
I have from time to time.

81
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,240
I maintain a Keybase profile as well.

82
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
I'm Chris Lass on there.

83
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,940
I'll tell you, I think you're right.

84
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,040
If you make it more difficult, less people will use it.

85
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:29,520
The hardest thing about encryption is the math can be solid, but the implementation

86
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,680
of the math can be flawed, and that implementation is really what makes the difference.

87
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:41,120
If you are really reliant on robust encryption, you have to also be very aware of how it's

88
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
implemented.

89
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,320
As an example, Signal is generally considered a well-implemented protocol, but the desktop

90
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,960
implementation of Signal on Windows was recently discovered to have cached plain text chats

91
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,640
that were outside the encryption scheme because of an implementation flaw.

92
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,400
Signal, the protocol, 100% solid, but the way it was implemented on the Windows desktop

93
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
wasn't.

94
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,560
That's what's happened here with these mail clients, and that's a point that Proton Mail

95
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,520
tried to make in the wake of all of this is, this is why we implement GNU PG encryption

96
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:17,200
specifically like this, and they outline all of that on their blog, which we also analyzed

97
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,920
in that episode of TechSnap, but I think it drives home the point that if you really are

98
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,680
going to be dependent on this, you have to be a connoisseur of the implementation of

99
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
the math.

100
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,160
Well, it's interesting you mentioned Signal.

101
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,720
It feels like that's where people are going for their encrypted communication is apps

102
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:39,800
like that, a more modern approach to encrypted messaging rather than good old-fashioned email,

103
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,200
and I feel that with each big story like this, a lot of people will only hear the headline

104
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:53,080
and not necessarily dig into it and think mistakenly that GPG has got the problem in

105
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,920
it or OpenPGP or whatever, and that means that maybe they'll be less likely to use that

106
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:04,720
kind of encryption, and it'll push them more to these sort of centralized apps rather than

107
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,480
the truly decentralized communication method that we've had for all these years, which

108
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
is email.

109
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,520
Yeah, there definitely could be that effect.

110
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:19,680
The implementation size, the momentum behind OpenPGP and GNU PG encrypted emails is so

111
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,680
large.

112
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,080
There are old-school folks out there that that's how they've been communicating for

113
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,440
a really long time, and they know how to do it right, and I don't think they're going

114
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
to be switching away.

115
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,600
So it's not like we're all just going to see it disappear, but I do think probably new

116
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,080
people coming online today or people that are getting into encryption because all of

117
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,400
a sudden they have something that they need to keep private, I bet you're right.

118
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,200
They're going more to things like Signal.

119
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,600
They're not going to Thunderbird with Enigma, and then setting up GPG keys and all of that.

120
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,760
I doubt it.

121
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,560
I don't know if it's necessarily better, though.

122
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,920
I think I would probably be happier if they were.

123
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,040
Yeah, it'd be interesting to hear how much of the audience uses encryption for their

124
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
emails.

125
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:01,400
So do get in contact, linuxactionnews.com.com It appears after the GNOME development community

126
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,620
received some feedback, they decided to roll back a somewhat controversial decision earlier

127
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:13,440
in the week to remove the ability for Nautilus to launch binary applications.

128
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,360
This caused quite a big stink, didn't it?

129
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
I had emails.

130
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
It was all over Telegram.

131
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,900
It was all over Reddit.

132
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,680
It was people saying, oh, look, typical GNOME behavior, removing features just because they

133
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,140
think people don't need them.

134
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:31,080
And at least this time they actually did listen, and they are bringing this feature back while

135
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,960
they're not taking it away, I suppose.

136
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:39,120
It is something that was a bit short-sighted of them, I think, to not consider that some

137
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,520
people do need to execute scripts and binaries from their file manager.

138
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Or app images.

139
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,360
Yeah, app images is a perfect example of that.

140
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:54,880
And OK, I said need to, yeah, you can open the terminal CD to the directory and run it

141
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
that way.

142
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,320
But most people just want a double-click job done, don't they?

143
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,740
You know what was funny is the day that this story broke, I bought a game called Everspace

144
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,560
off of GOG.com and downloaded it.

145
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,560
And you know what it was?

146
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,680
It was a binary file that I double-clicked on in my file manager, and then it ran me

147
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,520
through an installer the day that the story broke.

148
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:19,920
And this would have affected bin files, run files, shell scripts, dot app image files,

149
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
dot desktop files.

150
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,980
If you just have a dot desktop file you want to execute.

151
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,720
And I think the rationale for this was a couple things.

152
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,000
Number one, if they are removing desktop icons from Nautilus, it probably makes sense to

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
take this functionality out as well.

154
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,760
And then additionally, there's an unquestionable improvement in security.

155
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,720
A lot of users that are going to get some crypto ware around on their system or something

156
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,720
that runs as user privilege are going to be because they downloaded it and double-clicked

157
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,400
that file and it executed.

158
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,240
If you take that ability away from the users and say, no, you have to go through the launcher

159
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,560
or GNOME software, then you're going to substantially improve the security of the desktop for your

160
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
average user.

161
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,560
I'm just not a big fan of building a Linux desktop anymore for the average basic user.

162
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,420
I don't think that's our core demographic, and I think we make a very powerful operating

163
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:09,920
system less appealing as a tool to people that do want to use it to get complicated

164
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,960
jobs done.

165
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,440
So I'm never really on board with that rationale, but I can follow it to a certain logical conclusion.

166
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,240
But I think I agree with you.

167
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,520
It feels pretty disconnected from reality.

168
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,660
Now they did respond to the feedback and decided to halt for now, but discussions are ongoing

169
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,120
about maybe removing this functionality in the future.

170
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,080
And the use case that they cite, which we'll have linked in the show notes, linuxactionnews.com

171
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,460
slash 54, is an obvious one.

172
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,540
It involves somebody who has some scripts that they double click on and run while they're

173
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,580
working on other things.

174
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,360
It's something you would see in any office anywhere in the world.

175
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,760
And they apparently didn't consider this use case.

176
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,360
I am shocked by that.

177
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,100
I'm shocked that they talk about, they use language like, well, nobody is doing this,

178
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,400
and nobody should be running software that way, and nobody downloads a binary anymore.

179
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,300
That's just not acceptable.

180
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,040
That kind of language is surprising to me.

181
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,220
Yeah, it's just disconnected.

182
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,280
But there's such a simple solution here.

183
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:21,560
What happens on Android if you try and download a random APK and install it?

184
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,820
It says, this install has been blocked by default.

185
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,960
You have to go into your settings and change it if you want to install it.

186
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,360
And why not just do that?

187
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,840
Why not just have it buried in the settings somewhere that you have to enable it specifically?

188
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,560
And that means that the average user probably will never do that.

189
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,600
But power users, developers, whatever you want to call them, would just know to go in,

190
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,840
change one setting, job done.

191
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,860
Yeah, I think that's a pretty straightforward and almost obvious solution.

192
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,560
And you could integrate that with GNOME software.

193
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,520
I think that would be a pretty sensible place to put that.

194
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,160
And it'd be straightforward.

195
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,920
I guess I want to wrap this with, I do appreciate that they push this stuff forward because

196
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,400
it's nice to have a desktop out there doing that.

197
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,640
They have a responsibility in my eye that perhaps they don't feel they have.

198
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,240
And that is the lion's share of the large distributions now ship GNOME as the default

199
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,520
desktop environment.

200
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,680
That as a Linux community is our foot forward now, is the GNOME desktop.

201
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,560
And if they remove desktop icons, or they remove the ability to launch binaries from

202
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,200
the file manager, then it will be simply another extension that the distributions will pile

203
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,760
on on the version of GNOME that ships.

204
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,040
And it's going to perpetuate this issue where we become dependent on extensions.

205
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,120
And then they're going to put themselves into a corner when it comes time to roll GNOME

206
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
4.

207
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,720
And they either have to fundamentally break all extensions to have a multi process architecture,

208
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,000
or they maintain compatibility with extensions, and GNOME remains a single threaded desktop

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
environment.

210
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,760
Well, at least they have rolled back this change.

211
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,680
And it does show that they listen to the community.

212
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,760
Yeah, it does seem like they're taking a steady hand.

213
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,640
And maybe that is an acknowledgement of that responsibility that it's on so many large distributions

214
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
now.

215
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:06,240
But they are more receptive and taking things a little slower.

216
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,280
deo.co action.

217
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:11,640
Go there to that landing page, that there page, and that's DigitalOcean's way to get

218
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,280
you $100 in credit when you sign up for a new account.

219
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,640
DigitalOcean is infrastructure that you can spin up in less than 55 seconds.

220
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,920
They have SSDs on all of their rigs.

221
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,920
Depending on what you want, you can mix and match the resources as well.

222
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,600
If you need a lot of CPU or you want more disk, you can do that.

223
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,760
And they have data centers all over the world.

224
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,840
And they have some really great features, too.

225
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,800
I love this back end networking stuff they have that they call private networking.

226
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,160
I call it back end networking, really, because think of it like this.

227
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,920
You can have one box that's public facing, has a public IP address, and then you can

228
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,680
have three or four systems sitting behind that on a private internal data center network

229
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,520
that doesn't have a public address.

230
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,280
But your machine that's on the public face could still communicate with it.

231
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,920
And that's great for backups or a database or if you want to proxy something.

232
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,960
Or something I've played around with recently is a NAS system that's connected to a NextCloud

233
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,920
instance running on a Fedora 28 Cloud Droplet.

234
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,560
DigitalOcean has so many different options.

235
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,320
You can deploy an entire stack or a base Linux system and build it up.

236
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,320
They have a super smooth, easy-to-use interface for pros or for beginners.

237
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,920
And they have an API that's clean, simple, and well-documented.

238
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,360
Now, perhaps you're not a developer, so that doesn't matter to you.

239
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,720
But it does mean there's a ton of great open source applications already written that you

240
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,320
can use, integrate into your Linux desktop or on your mobile device, and manage all of

241
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
your Droplets.

242
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,880
It's pretty cool.

243
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:41,580
And you can start with $100 free credit when you go to dio.co slash action.

244
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:47,120
That's dio.co slash action.

245
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,440
It's been a good week for gaming, especially on Android.

246
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,120
Now instead of needing a Steam link box to stream your games from your big, beefy gaming

247
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,720
PC, you can just install an app on Android and away you go.

248
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,520
Yeah, as long as your PC is connected to Ethernet, you have to have a good connection on the

249
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,680
PC side at least.

250
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,000
And if your Android device is on 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi, you'll be able to play games on your

251
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,360
mobile using a Bluetooth Steam controller or any other Bluetooth gamepad device that

252
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,100
you can get paired to your phone.

253
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:21,920
And Valve says that apps could support up to 4K at 60 frames per second, but for the

254
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,680
most part, you're going to see most games streaming to your phone at 1080p, 60 frames

255
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,680
per second.

256
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,920
Yeah, I wonder if phones are really the target for this, because it would kind of make more

257
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,040
sense to use a bigger screen like with a tablet or even with an Android box plugged into a

258
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
TV, wouldn't it?

259
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,240
Yeah, I am biting at the chomp, as they say, to get the Nvidia Shield TV version of this.

260
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,560
It's an Android TV box.

261
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:47,600
It's wired in, and it's got a very high-end processor, so it should be able to do 4K.

262
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,400
Not that my TV is, but that's where I want to try this.

263
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,400
And think about it.

264
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,400
I could have one PC, and I confirmed with Valve that it will run on Linux.

265
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:01,600
I don't know if it does today, but their intention is to allow you to stream Linux Steam games

266
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,860
to these apps.

267
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,480
So it's not going to be a mutually exclusive thing to Windows.

268
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,400
And it's not actually exclusive to Android either, it is going to be coming to iOS, but

269
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,120
we don't talk about that on this show.

270
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,600
Well, yeah, I think Apple is just, they're taking their time.

271
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,480
They're really committed to gaming, Joe.

272
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,360
But then again, Apple isn't the only one having App Store problems this week.

273
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,160
Yeah, so some malware was found in the Snap Store and quickly removed, to be fair, and

274
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,760
it wasn't that harmful.

275
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,560
It was a cryptocurrency miner, so it pegged your CPU and wasted a load of battery life

276
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
or energy.

277
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,760
It didn't steal any information as far as we can tell at this stage.

278
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:48,800
But it is illustrative of a potential problem with how the whole Snap ecosystem works.

279
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,880
I don't think it's necessarily unique to the Snap ecosystem.

280
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:58,280
I think it's just one of the things you deal with when you have an open submission process.

281
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,960
Traditionally on Linux, it's a system that's designed for and by system administrators.

282
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,600
You have a group of small individuals that are choosing what software gets packaged up

283
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,520
and blessed and then put in the repositories.

284
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,440
And you as a user just assume that these people that have blessed the software have done their

285
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,480
job and you install it.

286
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,520
And it's worked really, really well for a long time.

287
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:27,680
But in the world of Docker Hub and Snap Stores and App Images, anybody can create one of

288
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,220
these and anybody could submit one of these.

289
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,040
But I think the interesting takeaway from what happened in the case of the Snap Store is

290
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,360
the conversation it seems to have sparked within Canonical after the fact.

291
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,240
Yeah, I think the most interesting aspect of this is that they're going to be adding

292
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,500
verified publishers, which means that when you go looking for a Snap, there'll be some

293
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:52,220
sort of check mark, blue tick or whatever for developers that are considered trusted.

294
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:58,560
And so you will know whether you're taking a risk or not with the Snap that you're downloading.

295
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,880
And this seems to me to be an absolute no brainer.

296
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,880
And I wonder why they didn't implement this from the beginning.

297
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,080
I wouldn't be surprised over the next couple of years if there's a few of these learning

298
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,080
processes as they get into this for the first time and really do something at this scale.

299
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,920
There's just certain things you learn.

300
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:19,240
It's in a way, it's like both Flatpak and Snaps have now had their rite of passage.

301
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,520
Flatpak was being used on the Pirate Bay to distribute pirated Windows games with wine

302
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,160
and DOS box or whatever wrapped up in them.

303
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:34,360
And now Snaps have been used to bundle a crypto miner that poses as a system demon.

304
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,640
It's sort of in a way like milestones, everybody.

305
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
Congratulations.

306
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,240
Yeah, it's like a coming of age almost.

307
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,240
Yeah.

308
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,340
Speaking of coming of age, it seems more and more distributions are dropping i386 support.

309
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,160
No more 32-bit for you.

310
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,240
Yeah, we've reported on this over the last few weeks.

311
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,600
And now the latest Ubuntu flavor to drop 32-bit images is Kubuntu.

312
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,200
You really do wonder what's going to happen with this.

313
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,480
Are they going to drop the whole archive?

314
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,800
There's a lot of discussion going on still, and we're going to continue to follow this.

315
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:15,160
I've had people say to me that they're using loads of 32-bit atom machines and stuff.

316
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,120
And I think it would be a mistake to drop the archive at this point.

317
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,740
But if they're going to drop it for the 2024 release, I think now is the time to prepare

318
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,680
people and just say, look, stay on 18.04 if you want to use 32-bit machines.

319
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,720
And you've got three years to migrate off to another distro.

320
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Yeah, I agree.

321
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,240
Now is the time to be having this conversation.

322
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,280
They got to get this squared away.

323
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,100
And I don't know if Kubuntu has much choice.

324
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:42,060
If the rest of Ubuntu goes this way, unless they want to maintain their own fork of all

325
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,140
of the 32-bit stuff, this is just the way the wind is blowing.

326
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,320
So I don't know how much of it is Kubuntu saying we're dropping 32-bit as it is saying

327
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,640
32-bit is just going away.

328
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,680
Well that does remain to be seen with regards to the archive.

329
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,460
Because if they do keep it around, then you will be able to use a net install or a minimal

330
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:07,060
image to build up a Kubuntu desktop or any of the other flavors who have dropped 32-bit.

331
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,480
That might be the way things go.

332
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,240
I like the way the Kubuntu project is handling this, though.

333
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:17,120
Valerie in the message says, look, we still have 18.04, 1, 2, et cetera, that we have

334
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,220
to QA.

335
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,240
We still have three years of supporting this LTS even if we are dropping 32-bit support.

336
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,020
So please keep helping us test.

337
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,020
And I think it's good to remind people of that.

338
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:30,340
At this stage, regardless of which way it goes, there's still going to be machines out

339
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,180
there for years running a version that's 32-bit today.

340
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:38,620
Yeah, maybe I should dig out my 32-bit on the laptop and do some testing.

341
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,780
But let's end with a quick one then.

342
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,440
Ubuntu 18.04 is now in the Windows 10 App Store.

343
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,940
So they are keeping up with the latest release there.

344
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,900
It's not something that's going away, the Windows subsystem for Linux.

345
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,900
Yeah.

346
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:57,140
And as a point of clarification, you now have two entries, Ubuntu, which is Ubuntu 16.04,

347
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,100
and then there now will be an Ubuntu 18.04 entry separately.

348
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,620
So they're keeping both of them in there for the Windows subsystem for Linux.

349
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,180
Yeah, it's almost like they didn't think that through, did they?

350
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,580
Well, I'm off to Texas.

351
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,820
June 8 through the 9th is Texas Linux Fest in Austin.

352
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,620
And if you're in the area and want to get some barbecue and hang out, join our Texas

353
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,580

354
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,900
We'll be planning meetups there, coordinating times.

355
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:28,100
We like to keep it fluid, and that's the best way we've found to do it, jupitabroadcasting.com

356
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100

357
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,560
Plus, I'll have the rover tracker on me the whole way down to Tejas.

358
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,960
So if you want to follow me and meet up along the way, jupitabroadcasting.com slash rover.
