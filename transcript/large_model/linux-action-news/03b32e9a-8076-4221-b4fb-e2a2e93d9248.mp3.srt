00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 239 recorded on May 5th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,700
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,720
And let's start with Google's work to add encryption to Linux's hibernation support

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,560
in an effort to improve security for Chromebooks.

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,280
Yeah, really, I think their goal here is to prevent userspace applications from using

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:30,700
hibernation as a stepping stone to some kind of kernel escalation.

10
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,940
So along with some improved userspace protections, the team is looking at mandating certain types

11
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,320
of encryption for hibernation.

12
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,840
The team notes that, quote, the hibernate image must be encrypted with protection derived

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,380
from both the platform, something like TPM, and user authentication data like your password.

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:55,460
It does seem the Google reviewed userspace software options for this job, such as USWSUSP

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:01,760
or userspace software suspend, but basically came to the conclusion that userspace software

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,140
helpers alone could not really meet their security requirements.

17
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,120
So yeah, in addition to adding some userspace tooling, Google is working on kernel based

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,240
encryption with support for using TPM backed keys to encrypt the hibernate image file,

19
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,760
sealing the encryption key with a PCR based policy, and a bunch of other work to ensure

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,000
that that encrypted image can actually be trusted.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,880
And then Google engineers posted an update on the kernel mailing list.

22
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,680
And they noted, quote, a couple of patches still need to be written on top of the series

23
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,840
and then later stating, we also need a patch that disallows unencrypted forms of resume

24
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,280
from hibernation to fully close the door to malicious userspace.

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,340
However, I wanted to get this series out first and get reactions from upstream before continuing

26
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,920
to add to it.

27
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,720
I would expect that this is probably going to move along at a pretty decent pace.

28
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,960
And we'll keep an eye out.

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,400
I think we'll see it in a future kernel update not too far down the road.

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,100
Sticking with kernel level improvements for just a moment, a new Apple M1 CPU frequency

31
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,060
driver has been posted by Asahi Linux's Hector Martin.

32
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,440
This work is important if we're ever going to see Linux achieve optimal performance and

33
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,760
good power and thermal management on Apple's shiny new silicon.

34
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,400
Right, you want that first class experience if you're going to spend all the money on

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
that hardware.

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,280
I suppose these new patches are a complete rewrite of the earlier driver.

37
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,560
This newly rewritten driver now avoids the memory controller performance switching, which

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,920
according to Hector is, quote, doesn't make a huge difference.

39
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,040
So it just kind of makes sense to punt that feature to the future.

40
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,360
This new driver is based on one that seems to have been originally created by ARM, or

41
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,000
at least they seem to own the copyright.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,960
It's called the System Control and Power Interface CPU Frequency Driver, or SCPI for short.

43
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,320
Some of the advantages of this now standalone driver include supporting fast switching,

44
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:05,280
reporting of the current CPU frequency to user space accurately, and support for exposing

45
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,080
the higher performance processor states as turbo states.

46
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,660
Well, those turbo states will be useful.

47
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,440
We have one more Apple M1 platform aside.

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,440
It seems they've achieved their first vulnerability that's unique to just the Apple silicon chips.

49
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,840
It's called Uggery, I believe, I'm not sure if I'm getting that right, it's A-U-G-U-R-Y,

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,620
and it's the world's first data memory dependent prefetcher vulnerability.

51
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,040
So if you're getting kind of like a Spectre or Meltdown vibe, you're not too far off the

52
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,040
mark.

53
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,560
So those are side channel vulnerabilities like Spectre, but they're only capable of

54
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,960
leaking in use data.

55
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,880
Apple's DMP vulnerability could potentially leak the entire memory contents, even if it's

56
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,120
not actively being accessed.

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,080
They're doing it better.

58
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,680
The researchers further stated that it seems Apple is fully aware of their discoveries,

59
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:04,600
but has not yet shared plans on whether or whether or not they will deploy mitigations.

60
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,520
Linux 5.19 is looking like another exciting release of our beloved kernel.

61
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,960
And it seems a very useful feature is in the works, one that enables initiating firmware

62
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,000
updates via sysfs.

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,640
Intel engineers worked on this one initially for their FPGA based PCIe cards.

64
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,240
They were building an ability to trigger a firmware update from userspace after a boot.

65
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,900
Now this firmware upload support is being added to the virtual sysfs kernel file system

66
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,100
so that userspace software can initiate a firmware update.

67
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,720
For supported devices, there will now be a data loading and timeout files in sysfs that

68
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,000
trigger firmware updates on a particular device during boot.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Here's the basic idea.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,120
You start things off by writing a one to that loading file.

71
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,800
Then you can take the binary contents of whatever firmware blob you're trying to use for update,

72
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,400
and then just write that to the data file, maybe using something like cat or DD.

73
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,240
Once that's done, you go back to the loading file and you write a zero to tell the kernel,

74
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,840
all done, it's your business now.

75
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,520
After that, the kernel uses its existing functionality for firmware updates and does everything for

76
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,520
you.

77
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,000
It's really quite neat if you think about the days when we had to go reboot into free

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,120
DOS to apply firmware updates or something.

79
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:30,600
And now you can do kind of the same thing with little more than a bash script.

80
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,880
And a quick heads up for you matrix admins out there, the matrix community has released

81
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,080
a high severity fix for the matrix app service IRC bridge.

82
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,760
The vulnerability could allow an attacker to manipulate a matrix user into executing

83
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,320
IRC commands by having them reply to a maliciously crafted message.

84
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,800
Yeah, it seems an incorrect handling of a carriage return character meant that the message

85
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,320
could be sent to the IRC server verbatim, rather than as a message to a specific channel.

86
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,600
The vulnerability has been patched in node IRC version 1.2.1.

87
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,140
And of course, also in matrix app service IRC 0.34.0.

88
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,000
Also in matrix related news this week, we got an update on the Gnome Foundation's complicated

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,760
relationship with matrix and IRC.

90
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,520
We'll have a link in the show notes if you want the full story.

91
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,600
But it seems that after years of uncertainty in a polarized community split between matrix

92
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:33,840
and IRC, the foundation is deciding to embrace matrix as their default and preferred platform.

93
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,320
With IRC remaining bridged and available, but secondary in nature.

94
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,080
The decision was reached partially based on a survey of the Gnome community itself.

95
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,060
And from that data, it became clear that while both matrix and IRC were popular top contenders

96
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:56,800
for a preferred chat platform within the community, matrix was preferred by newer members.

97
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,560
And IRC, well, it had a far more mixed rating with some users really loving it, but other

98
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,680
users kind of despising it.

99
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,600
It was also noted in the post that the federated and open nature of matrix really was an extra

100
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,680
point in its favor.

101
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,600
Quote, people can join our conversations whether they have a matrix.org account, a KDE one,

102
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,840
a Mozilla one, or whatever provider they want to use.

103
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,520
It's the modern day mailing list, in effect.

104
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,320
Now as to whether or not they take on the challenge of self hosting that instance, or

105
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:40,840
paying element hosted services to do it for them, that will be answered separately.

106
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,960
Linode.com slash LAN, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account, and you

107
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,500
go there to support the show.

108
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,640
And Linode has pricing that's 30 to 50% cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there that

109
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,100
want to lock you into their esoteric platforms.

110
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:58,140
It's how we've built everything we run in the cloud for the last few years.

111
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,780
It's easy to use, and it's powerful.

112
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,180
And Linode just recently announced that their managed database service is now generally

113
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,040
available with support from MySQL in all of their global data centers.

114
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,000
And I can tell you one thing that I have learned, if I can outsource something like database

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,360
management to a company like Linode, that's a win-win for somebody like me.

116
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,080
Not that we couldn't run it, or I couldn't at least talk West into running it, but honestly

117
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,380
Linode does this stuff so well.

118
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,360
They have super fast systems, crazy fast hard drives, 40 gigabit connections coming into

119
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,360
the machines.

120
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,400
They have 11 data centers around the world, but they're not just like chump data centers

121
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
either.

122
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,960
These are like pristine locations where Linode is their own ISP, and that inside those data

123
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,920
centers, they have such a great combination of services.

124
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:48,220
Instead of just like every possible thing they could ever conceive of and just take

125
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,600
on tons of investing to do it, they focused on the stuff that you really need, and they

126
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,000
made it work really well.

127
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,040
And that's what they've been doing for 19 years.

128
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,200
They have S3 compatible object storage that we use the crap out of, cloud firewalls, DDoS

129
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,880
protection, VLAN support, and a powerful DNS manager.

130
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,480
And one of the best things if you're in a large organization is they'll snap right into

131
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,080
your infrastructure management, Terraform, Kubernetes, you're going to get it done over

132
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
there.

133
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,520
They don't have any problems, they have the best support.

134
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,160
Number one feedback signal I get from our audience is I tried out Linode, it's amazing,

135
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,320
but wow did the support blow me away.

136
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,760
And I think people's first impressions is oh this is great, this UI is fantastic, these

137
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,840
selections are good, performance is great, but then when you get in a bind at some point,

138
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,440
Linode's support really comes through.

139
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,800
So go try it out for yourself and get $100 in 60 day credit, and you can support the

140
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
show.

141
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,000
It's a great chance to learn and a great chance to support Linux Action News.

142
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,720
So go to linode.com slash LAN.

143
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:57,280
That's where you go to get $100 in 60 day credit, linode.com slash LAN.

144
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:02,000
Linux.ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Action News.

145
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,760
Go see how much you could save and then take 25 bucks off of that by going to linux.ting.com.

146
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,400
It's a smarter way to do mobile.

147
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,880
You can start saving money right now and save money every single month.

148
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,120
They're a mobile virtual network operator, so they work at a level above digging holes

149
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
into the ground.

150
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,840
That means Ting focuses on their customers, they focus on their value and their deals,

151
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,560
and they really make a great competitive offering.

152
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,840
They were recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports in 2021, and they have

153
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,440
the same nationwide coverage, a great mix of plans, LTE and 5G data that you might expect

154
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,600
from those duopolies, but you're interfacing with Ting and they're straightforward plans

155
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,160
and they're no contracts.

156
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:46,040
I've been a Ting customer since 2013 because it's a smarter way to do mobile.

157
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,680
If somehow we could hit the reboot button on the mobile industry in the United States,

158
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,760
they would have to be built like this just to be competitive.

159
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,160
I'm so glad Ting's out there to just keep pressure on the industry to stay competitive

160
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,440
and Ting is better than anybody else.

161
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,480
So go try it by going to linux.ting.com and take 25 bucks off a phone.

162
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,600
Or if you bring a phone, they'll give you $25 in service credit.

163
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,640
Sometimes that pays for more than your first month.

164
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,800
That's how great Ting is.

165
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,720
So go get started today, linux.ting.com.

166
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:24,700
A community project to bring Steam Deck's operating system into a generic installable

167
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:30,680
format and replicate something close to the official SteamOS experience caught our eye

168
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,200
this week.

169
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,280
Stubbed Hollow ISO.

170
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:40,120
You might ask, how is this possible considering we have yet to see the official release of

171
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,600
SteamOS 3?

172
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,960
Well, SteamOS is built on open source.

173
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,520
So this is actually a community effort to sort of reverse engineer what folks are seeing

174
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:58,260
and experiencing on the Steam Deck and since SteamOS 3.0 is based on Arch, build that back

175
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,240
up themselves.

176
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,480
The aim here, at least at first, is to offer three different installer types.

177
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,200
You've got Bare Bones, which is just OS only, basically resembles pretty much a vanilla

178
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Arch install.

179
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,400
There's also Game Only mode if, you know, you're a serious gamer, you don't need any

180
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:21,120
Linux desktops, you just get the Steam Deck UI, which currently only works on AMD GPUs,

181
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,960
it sounds like, and doesn't include a desktop environment, just for gaming.

182
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:32,040
Or lastly, you can get the Deck Experience, which is the full SteamOS 3 experience with

183
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,960
proper session switching, KDE Plasma, good to go, media apps, and yeah, even Chromium.

184
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:44,480
I guess the people are tired of waiting for Valve to release SteamOS 3.

185
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,040
If our GitHub sleuthing is correct, the creator of this ambitious project might still be in

186
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
high school.

187
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,060
But either way, it makes it even more impressive in my opinion.

188
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,240
Like now the Holo ISO project has some major functionality working into boots, it gets

189
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,760
to the Deck UI, you can even access the Plasma desktop, Wes, I'm pretty sure you gave this

190
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,280
a go before the show.

191
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,640
Yes, I did.

192
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,000
You just need to go check their GitHub page, which of course we'll have in the show notes

193
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,160
and in the usual releases spot, there's the ISO ready to download.

194
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,080
Now you will need UEFI enabled.

195
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,960
And they do recommend AMD hardware at the moment.

196
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,680
Intel can work with some downgrading to get a Mesa version, not sure about Nvidia.

197
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:31,320
I ultimately, not having a Deck or suitable AMD hardware just laying around unfortunately,

198
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,560
I spun this up in a quick little QEMU virtual machine on my Intel laptop.

199
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,320
That meant I couldn't really try out the game mode.

200
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,480
Not sure I got the right out of box experience either because when I booted up, I was kind

201
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,680
of just dropped to a login session, you know, normal KDE login session sort of defaulting

202
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,040
to GameScope on Wayland, which I think would be the, you know, the Steam Deck UI experience.

203
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,520
Did have to try, you know, I just had to try, I knew it wouldn't work, but I had to try,

204
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
didn't work.

205
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,720
Switching that over to Plasma on X11 though, that logs right in, you get the same theme

206
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,760
that you're going to get on the Deck, otherwise, it kind of just feels like Plasma on Arch.

207
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,080
And it comes of course with Steam pre-installed, so that's already good to go.

208
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:22,280
Yeah, so it seems with Nvidia GPUs, it's pretty much not working, or if you're really savvy,

209
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,860
there are some workarounds you might be able to pull off.

210
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:30,840
And like with the Intel GPU, like you said, that isn't optimal, but if you downgrade Mesa,

211
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,520
you can actually get everything working.

212
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:38,880
Again, details are in the link in the show notes, but this is even just this idea that

213
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,640
somebody did this out there.

214
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,980
It's what I freaking love about the Linux community.

215
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,800
You wanted to put SteamOS on your toaster, well now you can have SteamOS on your toaster,

216
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,800
thanks to a developer who may not even be out of high school yet.

217
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,960
And hopefully, this sends a message to Valve that the community is ready for SteamOS 3

218
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,960
to be released.

219
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,840
We're waiting any day, and of course, when they do, we'll tell you about it right here

220
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,000
and give you our first take.

We are discussing our new website plans, tons of podcasting news, and it's just a great

228
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,720
community get together.

229
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,520

230
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,080
As for us, well, we'll be back next week, of course, with our take on the latest Linux

231
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,840
and open source news.

232
