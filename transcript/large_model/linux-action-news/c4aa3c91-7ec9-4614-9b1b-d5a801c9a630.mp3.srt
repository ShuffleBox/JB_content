00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 170, recorded on January 3, 2021.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,040
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,040
I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,100
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,520
And let's look back at the news.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,560
2020 really felt like one long month.

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,080
So we've broken things out mostly by topic rather than chronologically.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,720
Let me tell you, there were some major open source developments last year.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,720
Yeah.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,280
But we're going to have lots of links and we'll lean heavily on some great reporting

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,680
by Michael Arbel over at Ferronix.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,040
So be sure to check out our interview with him if you missed that in episode 166.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,080
Let's start things off where else but at the kernel of it all.

14
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:52,680
The Linux kernel entered 2020 at 27.8 million lines of code, but actually with fewer developers

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,480
than in 2019.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,180
Interestingly enough, later in the year, October 11th, we learned that the AMD Radeon graphics

17
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,880
driver makes up roughly 10.5% of those 27.8 million lines of code.

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,520
Turns out graphics drivers take a lot of lines of code.

19
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,720
They sure do, as do file systems.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,960
And we got some good news for the exFAT file system in 2020.

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,000
Now previously in the 5.4 kernel, we had a preliminary exFAT driver based on a several

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,440
year old snapshot from Samsung.

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:31,920
But after Microsoft made the exFAT specification public and encouraged support for Linux, Samsung

24
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,600
worked to upstream their much improved version that they've been developing internally and

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,800
shipping on their devices.

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,180
That drivers in much better shape and it's going to be continued to be maintained by

27
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:44,360
Samsung engineers going forward.

28
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,680
We got that in kernel 5.7.

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,160
There was an interesting trend that developed over the year that I don't know if we really

30
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:57,680
saw it coming, but you could say there was a robust conversation around the kernel's

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,080
scheduler in 2020.

32
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,980
And it literally kicked off on day one, January 1st, a Stadia developer kind of complained

33
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,760
that one of the adoption problems they were having was really because Linux's kernel wasn't

34
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:16,520
good enough and that it could do some improvements and perhaps some new developers and new code

35
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,640
in there, which as you can imagine, the kernel team, well, they had thoughts about that.

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,640
Oh yes.

37
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:27,520
In a mailing list discussion a few days later, Linus himself chimed in and wrote, the whole

38
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,680
post seems to be just wrong and is measuring something completely different than what the

39
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,820
author thinks and claims it is measuring.

40
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,960
First up, spinlocks can only be used if you actually know you're not being scheduled while

41
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
using them.

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,680
It basically reads the time before releasing the lock, then it reads it after acquiring

43
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,300
the lock again and claims that the time difference is the time when no lock was held, which is

44
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,240
just inane and pointless and completely wrong.

45
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,240
That's pure garbage.

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:02,620
Oh, a classic Linus take down, basically putting the whole conversation kind of in its place.

47
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,680
There was some development around other scheduler options though throughout 2020, but while

48
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,640
we're talking about kernel code contributions, well, you might be wondering what Oracle was

49
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,200
up to this year and their major contribution may surprise you, unless you're an existing

50
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,000
unbreakable Linux user.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,260
They submitted a pretty large patch set, which is actually a reduced focused version of what

52
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,800
ships in Oracle's unbreakable Linux called Ktask.

53
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,480
And it is a way for the kernel to do in kernel multi-threading for CPU intensive tasks.

54
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,280
It's a framework that's never made it into mainline Linux, but Oracle sure would love

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,360
you to use it and they have shipped it in their Linux and a newer iteration of the patch

56
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,900
series that's more streamlined has been submitted upstream this year.

57
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,840
But as far as we could tell when doing research before the show, it doesn't seem to have actually

58
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,640
been merged into the kernel.

59
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,880
Hey, maybe in 2021.

60
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,280
Michael Arbol notes that there were a few items we were expecting in 2020 that didn't

61
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,100
land and so we'll likely see them in 2021.

62
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,200
That's preempt RT, which has been talked about for a long time, but the conversation at this

63
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,960
last year's Linux Plumbers conference was really about landing it very soon.

64
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,340
BcacheFS, we've talked about that recently on the show.

65
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,760
We expect to see that in 2021, at least I hope.

66
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
Yeah, you hope.

67
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,920
Yeah, specifically, I hope.

68
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:29,040
And you do too, but now maybe not quite as much since I made it a prediction.

69
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,240
But one that would be really great for a lot of people out there is a new NTFS driver.

70
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,000
The one that's been developed by Paragon, who've been making NTFS drivers forever.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,520
It could land as well, almost made it, but officially Intel Multi-GPU support, which

72
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,840
could have some pretty epic implications for virtualization and all other kinds of tasks.

73
00:04:52,840 --> 00:05:01,880
And Wes, I know, lastly, you are really excited to see that Ryzer 5, Ryzer 5, Ryzer FS5 may

74
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,880
land.

75
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:08,200
Moving on up the stack, SystemD also had a pretty big 2020.

76
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:16,760
Started off at 1.5 million lines of code spanning over 48,000 commits from almost 2,000 different

77
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,180
authors.

78
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:27,040
Just in 2020 alone, there was 5,424 commits, which was up compared to 5,085 in 2019.

79
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:33,580
That added 300,000 lines of code and took away another 1,000, which hey, that's a lot

80
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,260
of work.

81
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,800
Some of that work included SystemD HomeD, which we've been quite interested in because

82
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,120
it makes it easier to support things like migratable home directories, more self-containment

83
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,720
within those home directories, better passwords and encryption handling, and a whole bunch

84
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,960
of other modern Linux home directory features.

85
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,360
Some of the design objectives are things like support for Lux encryption built right in,

86
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,280
mounting home directories off a CIF server, say, you may be using user space encryption

87
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:11,680
like FSCrypt, interfacing with butter FS sub volumes, and of course, because you gotta

88
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,120
have JSON, JSON formatted user records.

89
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
Right.

90
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,600
And as far as other big features in SystemD go this year outside of HomeD, there was OOMD,

91
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,280
which is an out of memory daemon that was originally developed at Facebook, and then

92
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,640
was modified for the use cases that SystemD would require.

93
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,480
So it is now functional on desktops as well.

94
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:40,520
The SystemD OOMD daemon, it pulls SystemD for OOMD enabled C groups.

95
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,720
It monitors them and then kills them based on memory pressure, which is a metric in your

96
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,360
Linux system, or swap usage.

97
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,040
And just an interesting note, Leonard Pottering of Red Hat continues leading SystemD development

98
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,700
after all this time and being responsible for just over a quarter of all patches to

99
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,700
SystemD's Git.

100
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,340
And of course, there were a whole bunch of other changes we don't have time to touch

101
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,720
on today.

102
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,680
But I'm wondering if any of those stood out to you, and maybe if you've got any hopes

103
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,160
for what happens to SystemD in 2021.

104
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,600
Yeah, of course.

105
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,320
You know, I look at it, and I think from a high level outside perspective, it seems like

106
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:22,320
things are pretty healthy over at SystemD land, the project is getting things done.

107
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,780
You saw ideas land early in the year, then you saw a test code in the middle of the year,

108
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,800
and then here we are at the end of the year, and we see major features actually shipping

109
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,840
in a released version.

110
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,600
They executed really well this year.

111
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,200
I think the one thing that could, well, use some improvement, some refinement is probably

112
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:46,720
their communication channel between SystemD and the kernel team.

113
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,040
That got a little rough this year.

114
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,640
Yeah, I mean, really, there's been a few spats over the years and 2020 was no different,

115
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:59,800
especially with a recent issue over a breaking change in SystemD around UdevBind events and

116
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,040
just whose fault that was.

126
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:25,360
From Intel in 2020, we saw some new Linux features, timely hardware support, and a whole

127
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
lot more.

128
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,520
However, it wasn't all great.

129
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,680
Early in the year, we saw the Linux community react to an unfortunate graphics driver flaw

130
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,760
that could have allowed an unauthenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure

131
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,280
if they had local access.

132
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,280
And actually, this was severe enough that Red Hat recommended entirely disabling the

133
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,440
Intel Linux graphics driver.

134
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,400
That of course has some downsides like losing out on hardware acceleration entirely, but

135
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,460
you also lose out on kernel mode setting, which generally means you'll be running at

136
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,480
a very low resolution.

137
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,360
To make matters worse, a little while later in February, a KVM virtualization bug was

138
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,960
discovered on Intel processors.

139
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:16,640
And thankfully, it was not another hardware vulnerability, but CVE-2020-2732 stemmed from

140
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,040
some unfinished code within the Intel VMX code support in the Linux kernel, and that

141
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
was embarrassing.

142
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,960
That is kind of embarrassing.

143
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,840
But they made up for it a little bit, at least in my eyes, in the later half of the year.

144
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,320
For the entire year, we saw the code be committed for Tiger Lake graphics, which is also known

145
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,760
as Intel Z graphics or Xe graphics.

146
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,840
And we actually saw that land in distributions at the end of 2020.

147
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,080
And man, does it really seem to impress.

148
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,600
I have a rig in for testing right now, and I've been blown away.

149
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,840
I've been getting blown away by the graphics performance of one of these ZE laptops.

150
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,480
And I think they nailed this.

151
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,280
And not only did we get great graphics with a baked-in driver, but we also got GPU accelerated

152
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,520
AV1 video decoding.

153
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:09,480
I know, I know, codecs are boring, but AV1 is an awesome new open codec.

154
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,680
And things like GPU acceleration are exactly what you need to see it adopted.

155
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,920
So hey, great job, Intel.

156
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,080
From the perspective of Linux users, AMD had a really great year.

157
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,160
They really delivered on their Ryzen 5000, Zen 3 desktop processors.

158
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,680
This was great, and maybe an even more important milestone was the Radeon RX 6000 Big Navi

159
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:35,880
graphics cards landing on day one with open source support for those new GPUs.

160
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,600
That's never really happened before.

161
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,280
And benchmarks have shown that those cards are delivering the best GPU performance for

162
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,480
an open source driver to date.

163
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,120
Also a feather in the cap of AMD Linux users was when Linus Torvalds announced he was switching

164
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,960
after 15 years of using Intel systems to an AMD Ryzen Threadripper.

165
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,940
He wrote, in fact, the biggest excitement for me this week was just that I upgraded

166
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,740
my main machine.

167
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:07,440
And for the first time in 15 years, my desktop isn't Intel based.

168
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:15,960
No, no, I didn't switch to ARM yet, but I'm now rocking an AMD Threadripper 3970X.

169
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,760
My all mod config test builds are now three times faster than they used to be.

170
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,380
As always, Red Hat was in the news all year long, but they particularly made news towards

171
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,360
the end of the year when they announced that CentOS would be refocusing on CentOS Stream.

172
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,200
On December 8th, Red Hat announced it was refocusing the project and refactoring the

173
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,200
support window to just December 31st of this year.

174
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,000
A surprising change.

175
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,360
This change is still not really sitting well with many of the traditional CentOS users.

176
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,240
So Red Hat is still expressing optimism for this CentOS Stream change and they say, we

177
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,480
think it will work for around 95% of current workloads and they'll be rolling out some

178
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,840
new yet to be announced options for helping fill in the gap between CentOS and RHEL.

179
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:05,960
Given the complicated community reactions for several weeks after the announcement,

180
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:11,880
Red Hat and the CentOS team tried to clarify the logic behind the change.

181
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,000
In that vein, on December 19th, Karsten Wade, who has been one of the original CentOS board

182
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:23,040
members, longtime Fedora contributor, and a senior community architect for Red Hat,

183
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,920
penned a CentOS blog post that continued to plead their case.

184
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:30,280
It basically lays out the case from an open source perspective that the move is great

185
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,320
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux since it's no longer going to be developed behind a firewall,

186
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,560
but will now have an open source upstream, which is CentOS Stream, that anyone can see

187
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,280
as it's being developed.

188
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,440
Ultimately, Red Hat has now established a CentOS questions email address where they're

189
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,360
seeking feedback, good or bad, about these planned changes.

190
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,680
And no doubt about it, one of the stories of 2021 will be distributions coming online

191
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,240
trying to fill this gap that traditional CentOS has left, but I maintain, I think a lot of

192
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,440
people when they look at CentOS Stream and they look at the universal base image that

193
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,560
is essentially RHEL, I think you could put those two things together and you'll probably

194
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,960
be all right.

195
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,460
Linode.com slash Lion.

196
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:21,040
You go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards your new account.

197
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,280
Linode is the largest independent cloud out there and they're our cloud provider.

198
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,840
When I started a couple of years ago, I needed something that was just different and I had

199
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,640
heard of Linode and wanted to try it.

200
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:35,640
But then now, two years later, I was getting ready to launch JB 3.0 and I needed something

201
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:41,320
that would break the bank, but also would have a professional high quality experience

202
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
for my audience.

203
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,280
And it was obvious to deploy on Linode and I didn't have a $100 credit, so I was taking

204
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:51,800
advantage of like their $5 a month rig at first and I scaled that up as I needed that.

205
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,360
And then I've rolled in services like object storage now to hold some of our more static

206
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,840
assets also perfect for something like a static website.

207
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,120
If you want a really quick portfolio or personal website, maybe you should look at what you

208
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,480
can do with object storage and a simple website on Linode, but get started by going to Linode.com

209
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,720
slash LAN.

210
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,280
It gives you the $100 60 day credit and it supports the show.

211
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,480
They're my cloud hosting provider.

212
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,920
We build everything on Linode.

213
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,960
So that's why when I say I know you can deploy like a company chat server that can handle

214
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,720
hundreds of connections simultaneously or more, I can tell you with confidence.

215
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
Yeah, Linode is going to be able to do that.

216
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,640
If you need something for next cloud up in the cloud, Linode can handle that as well.

217
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:39,160
We've integrated our next cloud with their object storage system, which is slick and

218
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,820
with 11 data centers worldwide, you're going to find just the right spot to deploy for

219
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,920
you or maybe your clients, in my case, my audience.

220
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,480
So check them out Linode.com slash LAN.

221
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
See why I love them.

222
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,680
See how fast they are with their native SSDs, 40 gigabit connections and their awesome cloud

223
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,780
dashboard.

224
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,760
And with their costs 30 to 50 percent lower than major providers, you're going to get

225
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,760
a lot of mileage.

226
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,320
And at the end of the day, you're also investing in a company that's part of the Linux community.

227
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,020
They've been here since the very beginning of cloud computing.

228
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,820
They helped to find what it means.

229
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,120
And now they're one of the remaining independent champions, Linode.com slash LAN.

230
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:21,900
Go check them out and tell them we sent you Linode.com slash LAN.

231
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:27,560
Over 2020, Microsoft made some interesting strides from giving their blessing to Samsung

232
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,800
upstreaming their improved ex-fat driver to contributing more and more code to Mesa in

233
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,300
order to leverage OpenGL and OpenCL code in various Windows components.

234
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:44,520
And on March 14th, they announced that WSL2 would be reaching general availability, promoting

235
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:50,240
it to officially be a part of Windows 10 powered by Hyper-V and giving access to the Linux

236
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,240
command line right from Windows.

237
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:58,440
On May 14th, Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, acknowledged that Microsoft was previously

238
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,160
wrong on open source.

239
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,440
While Microsoft executives in the past years had called open source a cancer and other

240
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,340
types of FUD, the current president of Microsoft, Brad Smith, acknowledged that they were wrong

241
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,760
in those past remarks.

242
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:15,120
Quote, Microsoft was on the wrong side of history when open source exploded at the beginning

243
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,260
of the century.

244
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,440
And I can say that about me personally.

245
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:23,440
The good news is that if life is long enough, you can learn that you need to change.

246
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,840
Today, Microsoft is the single largest contributor to open source projects in the world when

247
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,180
it comes to business.

248
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:34,680
We look at GitHub, we see it as the home for open source development, and we see our responsibility

249
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,360
as its steward to make it secure and a productive home for developers.

250
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,960
Okay, Brad Smith, okay.

251
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,040
It came on strong.

252
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,800
Well, at least they're learning.

253
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,080
Something else they've been learning about in 2020 though has been Wayland because on

254
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:59,880
May 20th at Build 2020, Microsoft demoed GPU acceleration and GUI app support in WSL2 using

255
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:06,240
their own Wayland compositor with a glorified RDP setup for showing the applications running

256
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,480
on Linux but right there on your Windows desktop.

257
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,120
Yep, we cover that here on this podcast.

258
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,880
And also you can't really talk about the year of Microsoft and Linux without mentioning

259
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:25,120
that on September 22nd, they announced edge was coming out for Linux and then about a

260
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:32,240
month later, they made good and released Microsoft edge, the web browser on Linux.

261
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,680
And it's not that bad.

262
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:40,920
KDE had a very eventful year where it saw its Wayland support come together quite nicely.

263
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:45,280
So much so in fact that it's usable on a day to day basis.

264
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,600
But really, I think we have to say that plasma's big milestone for the year was the release

265
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,440
of their latest LTS.

266
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:59,520
KDE Plasma 5.18 brought much better integration with GTK and GNOME applications, a new opt-in

267
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,400
system and user feedback feature, and a hell of a lot of polishing all around the Plasma

268
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
desktop.

269
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,340
We could easily dedicate an entire episode to this but I wanted to give a special shout

270
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,760
out to one of the great native text editors on desktop Linux, Kate.

271
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,240
It turned 20 years old this year and still getting new cool features added to it.

272
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,160
It's actually what I used this morning to do a lot of the notes for this week's episode

273
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,600
when I had a web outage.

274
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,200
Just use a good old local native text editor and I was very thankful for its markdown support.

275
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,240
There's a lot to talk about though.

276
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,160
So you can just kind of scratch a little bit more of the surface if you check out our interview

277
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,080
with Nick Graham, that's Linux Unplugged episode 385, linuxunplugged.com slash 385.

278
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,840
He and I discussed some of the improved UI features and other aspects that landed in

279
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Plasma this year.

280
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:56,720
Turning into that other desktop environment, GNOME saw many improvements in 2020, including

281
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,520
a number of significant performance optimizations.

282
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:05,460
And while GNOME on Wayland has been solid for quite some time, there's been some further

283
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,840
enhancements over there as well.

284
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,000
It was interesting watching all of this go down in GNOME OS, which we got a little more

285
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,480
information about around July 22nd at Guadic 2020.

286
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:24,160
One of the talks there was focused on running GNOME OS on real hardware, which traditionally

287
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,260
GNOME OS has been a virtual machine image for testing.

288
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,620
With work done though recently by Codethink and other GNOME developers, it's becoming

289
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,680
possible to run GNOME OS on bare metal hardware.

290
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:41,480
And thanks to the likes of Flack Pack and OS Tree, it's becoming more and more like

291
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,080
just a regular old Linux distribution in terms of package availability.

292
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,640
Who knows, in 2021, you may hear us reviewing GNOME OS.

293
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,640
I don't think so.

294
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,400
2020 also saw the official announcement of GNOME Circle, which is aimed at lowering the

295
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,720
barrier for allowing new applications and libraries to become part of the GNOME project.

296
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,340
So hey, there's maybe there'll be some new parts of GNOME to enjoy in 2021.

297
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,680
There was also the big announcement about GTK4 on December 16th.

298
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,880
It was officially released.

299
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,520
It features many new widgets and reworking to existing elements and integrated media

300
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:24,360
playback support and also excitingly GPU acceleration with a Vulkan render and better Mac OS support.

301
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,680
So GTK4 is now considered stable for applications to begin supporting it.

302
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:36,200
GTK3 will continue to be maintained for the foreseeable future, while GTK2 is no longer

303
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:40,680
going to be supported beyond one more point release.

304
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,440
And it goes without saying that all of this amazing work was done during a year like no

305
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
other.

306
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,920
And we really just touched on the highlights.

311
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,760
open source news.

312
