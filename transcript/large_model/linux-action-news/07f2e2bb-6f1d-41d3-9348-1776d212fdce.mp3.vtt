00:00.000 --> 00:08.960
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 166, recorded on December 6th, 2020.

00:08.960 --> 00:09.960
I'm Chris.

00:09.960 --> 00:10.960
And I'm Wes.

00:10.960 --> 00:11.960
Hello, Wes.

00:11.960 --> 00:12.960
Let's do the news.

00:12.960 --> 00:16.800
And let's start with the many Linux desktop environments that saw updates this week.

00:16.800 --> 00:17.800
Right.

00:17.800 --> 00:18.800
One of them was Budgie.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.120
Budgie 10.52 is here.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.480
Lots of changes and improvements.

00:22.480 --> 00:26.880
It's more than a year of work that's went into this release, but I think probably the

00:26.880 --> 00:32.240
most notable thing is they've based it on the latest GNOME 3.38 stack now.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.740
But there are many improvements and fixes for you Budgie users out there.

00:35.740 --> 00:39.620
So we do have a link to the announcements page in our show notes.

00:39.620 --> 00:45.760
Next on the list, the KDE project released KDE Plasma 5.20.4 as the fourth maintenance

00:45.760 --> 00:51.820
update to the Plasma 5.20 series with another batch of bug fixes and improvements.

00:51.820 --> 00:57.760
But amongst those fixes, the audio volume applet no longer displays an unknown and non-functional

00:57.760 --> 01:01.200
device with the text device name not found.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.080
I do like those nice quality of life fixes.

01:04.080 --> 01:10.720
5.20.4 also is seeing some improvements for the Wayland session land, including some title

01:10.720 --> 01:16.400
bar context menu fixes, a bug that would make apps crash when trying to view font related

01:16.400 --> 01:17.400
items.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.720
All of that has been fixed up.

01:18.720 --> 01:22.000
And I'm happy to report I went ahead and did the upgrade this morning before the show.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.600
I figured let's try it live and upgraded and everything went just fine.

01:26.600 --> 01:32.120
In fact, like a lot of my experiences with Plasma updates, it just chugs right along.

01:32.120 --> 01:36.120
You know, I've occasionally had a few new bugs introduced, but they're always fixed

01:36.120 --> 01:37.120
by the next update.

01:37.120 --> 01:42.680
Yeah, sometimes some do sneak in some regressions, but they are really good and about fixing

01:42.680 --> 01:43.680
it.

01:43.680 --> 01:47.360
And the trend line, I think has been has been generally positive, like it has with the GNOME

01:47.360 --> 01:49.000
desktop recently.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.160
And this week saw GNOME 3.3.8.2 come out, which is second of many to come point releases

01:55.160 --> 01:57.400
for the GNOME 3.3.8 desktop.

01:57.400 --> 02:02.320
I think what's also notable in this is they've done some work to make their own GNOME OS

02:02.320 --> 02:07.560
project more accessible for developers and users who want to test upcoming features in

02:07.560 --> 02:11.560
the desktop environment, sort of a blessed GNOME environment for you to get to work on.

02:11.560 --> 02:16.200
But I thought also worth mentioning here is this is it for GNOME in 2020.

02:16.200 --> 02:22.320
They have a planned point release for the 3.3.8 desktop environment in early January,

02:22.320 --> 02:29.400
along with the alpha release of the upcoming GNOME 40 desktop series.

02:29.400 --> 02:35.400
There's a lot going on in that desktop series, version 40, and we've been discussing it and

02:35.400 --> 02:36.640
digging in in Linux Unplugged.

02:36.640 --> 02:41.400
So if you're curious, check out our coverage on GNOME 40 in Linux Unplugged.

02:41.400 --> 02:46.560
People swear in the GTK universe, and after more than six months in development, Cinnamon

02:46.560 --> 02:48.800
4.8 is finally here.

02:48.800 --> 02:54.240
And actually, it's already made an appearance in the software repositories of Arch.

02:54.240 --> 03:00.080
The biggest new feature in Cinnamon 4.8 is a new suspend then hibernate function that

03:00.080 --> 03:05.080
instructs the desktop environment to first suspend the system and then hibernate after

03:05.080 --> 03:08.260
a certain time period of inactivity.

03:08.260 --> 03:14.040
Another important change in Cinnamon 4.8 can be found under the hood as the Cinnamon JavaScript

03:14.040 --> 03:19.900
interpreter now uses Mozilla's newer Moe's JS 78 JavaScript engine.

03:19.900 --> 03:24.560
This makes Cinnamon startup much faster and should be easier to maintain by other GNU

03:24.560 --> 03:28.360
Linux distributions outside of Linux Mint.

03:28.360 --> 03:33.160
Now speaking of Linux Mint, Cinnamon 4.8 will be the default desktop environment of the

03:33.160 --> 03:40.320
upcoming Linux Mint 21, which will be based on Ubuntu 20.04.1 and expected to arrive sometime

03:40.320 --> 03:41.320
near Christmas.

03:41.320 --> 03:45.600
Well, speaking of Christmas, I think the Raspberry Pi is going to make a very tempting holiday

03:45.600 --> 03:48.200
gift and it just got a little bit better.

03:48.200 --> 03:53.520
Keeping with tradition, they have some year-of-end updates, including a brand new release of

03:53.520 --> 03:55.120
Raspberry Pi OS.

03:55.120 --> 04:00.640
They've updated the Chromium browser to version 84, but as they note, it did take a bit longer

04:00.640 --> 04:02.440
than they would have hoped.

04:02.440 --> 04:06.160
So it's quite a lot of work to get video hardware acceleration integrated with a new release

04:06.160 --> 04:07.160
of the browser.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.740
And yeah, I can appreciate that.

04:08.740 --> 04:10.000
Nice to see it, though.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
Nice to see it.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.560
It makes a big difference on that scale of hardware.

04:13.560 --> 04:19.240
Another thing that's just kind of finally, but nice to see as well is Raspberry Pi OS

04:19.240 --> 04:21.720
is switching to Pulse Audio.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.440
Yes, Pulse Audio, the sound server.

04:24.440 --> 04:26.840
The new modern setup, yeah.

04:26.840 --> 04:27.840
Not PipeWire.

04:27.840 --> 04:28.840
No, no.

04:28.840 --> 04:33.200
I was reaching out from Ulsa and they note in their announcement about this that Ulsa

04:33.200 --> 04:34.720
had some limitations.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.880
It could only handle one input and output at a time.

04:37.880 --> 04:41.440
It didn't handle Bluetooth audio at all.

04:41.440 --> 04:47.040
And it is an example of why I think Raspberry Pi OS is great for some.

04:47.040 --> 04:51.180
For those of us who've been using Linux for a while, it's just a little too eclectic.

04:51.180 --> 04:53.600
It's a little too esoteric still.

04:53.600 --> 04:57.640
And the fact that they're just now switching to Pulse Audio when PipeWire is nearly here

04:57.640 --> 05:04.040
is an example of why I kind of often will skew to using things like Ubuntu or Manjaro

05:04.040 --> 05:05.040
on my Raspberry Pis.

05:05.040 --> 05:08.700
Yeah, I don't think they were planning for someone like you who abuses their platform

05:08.700 --> 05:09.700
a little too far.

05:09.700 --> 05:12.320
I do push it to the limit sometimes.

05:12.320 --> 05:17.920
But there is some improvements to accessibility in this release and that's actually something

05:17.920 --> 05:20.120
they've been working on throughout this year.

05:20.120 --> 05:24.160
Oka Screen Reader is in there at the start of the year and then over the summer they

05:24.160 --> 05:28.620
put in a display magnifier for folks who have limited visibility.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.840
And you know, I knock on Raspberry Pi, but it is really nice to see that kind of stuff

05:31.840 --> 05:32.920
go in there.

05:32.920 --> 05:38.000
And then there are nice customizations that make the quality of life on the Pi a little

05:38.000 --> 05:39.240
bit better.

05:39.240 --> 05:45.360
In this December release, there's also now a low voltage warning that's been added to

05:45.360 --> 05:49.620
the battery monitoring plugin, easier for me to say, that will warn you if you're not

05:49.620 --> 05:51.040
sufficiently supplying voltage.

05:51.040 --> 05:54.640
And this is a super common problem with power adapters in the Raspberry Pi.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.560
People don't quite get something that supplies enough power.

05:57.560 --> 06:02.840
Or you're powering a USB disk off of the USB bus, which draws a lot of power.

06:02.840 --> 06:07.800
And then when you're right on that line, it's nice to have something that will warn you.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.520
So they've added that in there.

06:09.520 --> 06:12.680
Also just notable for those of you who are going to be running this, it is now also based

06:12.680 --> 06:16.920
on Linux kernel 5.4.79.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.800
So if you're thinking about getting somebody a Pi 400 for the holidays, Wes, just got a

06:20.800 --> 06:22.360
little bit better.

06:22.360 --> 06:28.440
Something else for Pi fans to celebrate is that the V3DV driver is now officially Vulkan

06:28.440 --> 06:34.040
1.0 Conformant for supporting things like high performance graphics and compute atop

06:34.040 --> 06:36.120
the Raspberry Pi 4 and newer.

06:36.120 --> 06:42.700
If you're not familiar, V3DV is the modern Vulkan driver for current Broadcom SOCs catering

06:42.700 --> 06:46.240
to the Raspberry Pi 4 and presumably future chips as well.

06:46.240 --> 06:52.520
Yeah, it's big to get Vulkan on there, but also they're working on native Wayland support.

06:52.520 --> 06:58.680
An independent contributor has worked on the Wayland system integration for V3DV and went

06:58.680 --> 07:01.720
through the steps to get it merged into mainline Mesa.

07:01.720 --> 07:06.440
So we're going to have this in Mesa 21.0, which is due out next quarter.

07:06.440 --> 07:12.160
This is a huge milestone for the Raspberry Pi and out of the box, general Linux distribution

07:12.160 --> 07:13.720
graphics support.

07:13.720 --> 07:16.720
And we've been waiting for quite a while to see this and now we're getting everything

07:16.720 --> 07:17.920
we'd we'd hope to see.

07:17.920 --> 07:21.840
So, you know, it'll take a little while for it to trickle down to everybody because you're

07:21.840 --> 07:25.800
going to have to get newer kernels, newer Mesa, you're gonna have to get some of the

07:25.800 --> 07:30.160
latest Vulkan updates, but eventually it'll be to the point where this stuff just comes

07:30.160 --> 07:35.600
shipped in every distribution, making the Raspberry Pi closer to a just general computer

07:35.600 --> 07:36.920
that you can put a Linux distro on.

07:36.920 --> 07:41.960
Well, I guess I know what I'll be putting in your stocking this Christmas.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.880
linode.com slash LAN.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.840
Linode is the largest independent cloud.

07:45.840 --> 07:49.640
Simplify your cloud infrastructure with our cloud hosting provider.

07:49.640 --> 07:55.460
They are the back end for Jupiter broadcasting 3.0, been using them for a little while now.

07:55.460 --> 08:00.100
And they're fast machines with native SSD storage, 40 gigabit connections, and a really

08:00.100 --> 08:02.080
easy to use cloud manager.

08:02.080 --> 08:05.000
But what's also great is Linode is local.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
You know what I mean?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.960
They're a supporter of the Linux community.

08:07.960 --> 08:11.620
They are independently owned and founded on a love for the technology that was coming

08:11.620 --> 08:12.800
in the Linux kernel.

08:12.800 --> 08:16.100
And then they've stepped up over the years by supporting open source initiatives.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.840
They've been part of the Kubuntu project.

08:17.840 --> 08:22.080
They've been part of All Things Open, and of course, our beloved Linux Fest Northwest.

08:22.080 --> 08:27.440
And now here they are supporting independent media, making it possible for us to give our

08:27.440 --> 08:30.900
independent content away for free to our audience.

08:30.900 --> 08:33.480
Linode is dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.360
If it runs on Linux, it'll run on Linode.

08:36.360 --> 08:41.720
I'll also recommend you check out their S3 compatible object storage, which is proven,

08:41.720 --> 08:44.180
it's stable, and it's inexpensive technology.

08:44.180 --> 08:50.360
It really makes it ideal for archives or backup sets or a static website, maybe assets like

08:50.360 --> 08:55.920
images or soundboard clips, which we use it here to just embed the soundboard clips right

08:55.920 --> 08:57.920
into our show notes.

08:57.920 --> 09:02.000
Object storage is great too, because it doesn't require a server sitting in front of it.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.700
So it's extremely economical.

09:03.700 --> 09:08.960
They have all kinds of great features at Linode, from node bouncers to systems with GPUs or

09:08.960 --> 09:12.400
dedicated CPUs, and they start at just $5 a month.

09:12.400 --> 09:18.800
So if you go to linode.com slash LAN, you'll get a $100 60 day credit on a new account.

09:18.800 --> 09:24.040
And with their price structure, you can build a lot of system with that $100 credit.

09:24.040 --> 09:28.080
See what we've been talking about, because Linode costs 30 to 50% less than major cloud

09:28.080 --> 09:29.920
providers like AWS.

09:29.920 --> 09:32.260
And they were around three years before AWS.

09:32.260 --> 09:36.760
And with 11 data centers worldwide, you're going to find just the right spot to deploy.

09:36.760 --> 09:42.800
So to go to linode.com slash LAN to get started, get that $100 60 day credit, that's linode.com

09:42.800 --> 09:44.000
slash LAN.

09:44.000 --> 09:49.080
And thank you to everyone who supports these shows by supporting our sponsors, by taking

09:49.080 --> 09:51.360
advantage of these offerings.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.680
We really appreciate it.

09:52.680 --> 09:57.280
And thanks to Linode for making it possible for independent media to give their content

09:57.280 --> 09:58.840
away for free.

09:58.840 --> 10:02.520
Linode.com slash LAN.

10:02.520 --> 10:07.840
With SUSE's acquisition of Rancher Labs finalizing this week, we thought we'd add some context

10:07.840 --> 10:10.880
to what could be a significant story.

10:10.880 --> 10:16.900
Recent data from Dice's 2020 tech job report found there's been an 82% increase in job

10:16.900 --> 10:22.120
demand for individuals with Kubernetes skills over the past year alone.

10:22.120 --> 10:26.680
Dice predicts that the demand for Kubernetes skills will continue to grow and enjoy a projected

10:26.680 --> 10:30.640
growth rate of more than 67% over the next 10 years.

10:30.640 --> 10:36.100
Yeah, you could see how this is becoming a pretty important segment of the tech industry.

10:36.100 --> 10:39.960
And Rancher quickly became a player in that space of some significance.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.600
Here's a little background on them.

10:41.600 --> 10:46.600
They were widely or I guess they still are widely known as one of the main innovators

10:46.600 --> 10:47.600
in Kubernetes.

10:47.600 --> 10:51.980
I think one of their key value adds is the ability to manage different deployments at

10:51.980 --> 10:55.080
different scales across different providers.

10:55.080 --> 10:58.640
That's one of the things Rancher is known for is handling those operational and security

10:58.640 --> 11:02.600
challenges of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters.

11:02.600 --> 11:08.320
Specifically, it supports any cloud native computing foundation certified Kubernetes

11:08.320 --> 11:09.600
distribution.

11:09.600 --> 11:14.120
So that includes the ones from Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.

11:14.120 --> 11:19.160
And that's really nice because cloud lock-in is often a pain point for many enterprises.

11:19.160 --> 11:24.640
Now Rancher Labs was funded with $10 million in 2015.

11:24.640 --> 11:30.520
And then $20 million in 2016 and $40 million in 2020.

11:30.520 --> 11:34.680
In May of 2020, they launched Rancher Academy.

11:34.680 --> 11:39.280
And then in April of this year, Rancher Labs released an update to their management platform

11:39.280 --> 11:44.240
that made it easier to upgrade without particular kinds of downtime.

11:44.240 --> 11:47.000
In addition to simplifying remote access.

11:47.000 --> 11:52.840
And it was around this time it was estimated that Rancher had 37,000 active users and 100

11:52.840 --> 11:55.240
million downloads of its flagship software.

11:55.240 --> 12:00.200
Now mind you, some of those 37,000 active users would be inside very large enterprises

12:00.200 --> 12:01.920
with massive deployments.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.520
Oh yeah.

12:03.520 --> 12:10.180
And then in July 2020, Rancher announced its definitive agreement to be acquired by SUSE.

12:10.180 --> 12:12.360
That deal closed this week.

12:12.360 --> 12:17.280
When the acquisition was originally announced, Rancher Labs was quick to point out that they

12:17.280 --> 12:20.400
intend to remain an open source first company.

12:20.400 --> 12:24.520
Adrian Goins is in charge of Rancher Labs' community.

12:24.520 --> 12:27.320
And he made this note on YouTube when the news came out.

12:27.320 --> 12:31.280
There aren't very many companies who hold a true open source ethos at their core.

12:31.280 --> 12:34.760
Even fewer companies hold true to that mission as they grow.

12:34.760 --> 12:35.960
Rancher always has.

12:35.960 --> 12:40.260
And that's why we are so excited to be joining forces with SUSE.

12:40.260 --> 12:44.740
The acquisition upon closure will establish SUSE and Rancher as the open source innovator

12:44.740 --> 12:49.080
of choice for Kubernetes, enterprise Linux, edge computing and AI.

12:49.080 --> 12:53.800
We'll certainly be able to see that influence because after the deal, Rancher's CEO and

12:53.800 --> 12:59.360
co-founder Shen Liang will be president of engineering and innovation at SUSE in charge

12:59.360 --> 13:02.720
of all of their engineers.

13:02.720 --> 13:07.600
Terms of the deal were not publicly disclosed, but the CNBC report published after the initial

13:07.600 --> 13:12.520
announcement quoted sources familiar with the deal, saying that SUSE is paying between

13:12.520 --> 13:16.980
$600 and $700 million.

13:16.980 --> 13:22.840
This acquisition is SUSE's first step to expanding, really, since EQT bought SUSE from Microfocus

13:22.840 --> 13:26.600
and freed it with the sole mission of growth in March 2019.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.600
Right.

13:27.600 --> 13:28.600
Right.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.740
Yes, EQT is still involved there, but this really follows something that we've reported

13:32.740 --> 13:38.100
on recently, which is strong fiscal momentum and performance by SUSE.

13:38.100 --> 13:44.000
In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, they saw bookings increase 30% year over year,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.600
while global cloud revenue was up 70% year over year.

13:47.600 --> 13:51.640
So they're leveraging that recent success to make a purchase that I think, at least

13:51.640 --> 13:57.560
in my opinion, Wes, makes them a lot more relevant a lot faster all of a sudden in big

13:57.560 --> 13:58.560
cloud computing.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.880
It was something that we'd sometimes remark that SUSE had seemed like they'd kind of missed

14:01.880 --> 14:07.080
the boat where Ubuntu and Red Hat had really been very successful.

14:07.080 --> 14:11.920
SUSE was sort of in a distant third place, but with this acquisition, it seems like they

14:11.920 --> 14:13.840
just fast forwarded a few years.

14:13.840 --> 14:17.280
I know you've had some hands-on experience with this in the past.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.280
Do you think this is a winner?

14:18.280 --> 14:19.280
Yeah.

14:19.280 --> 14:23.560
You know, Rancher enjoys a good amount of popularity and goodwill in the Kubernetes

14:23.560 --> 14:24.560
community, right?

14:24.560 --> 14:28.480
They make some really handy tools that a lot of people adopt, and I think as you touched

14:28.480 --> 14:31.240
on earlier, they're easy to get started with, right?

14:31.240 --> 14:35.360
If you already have some clusters provisioned wherever, you've got one on-premises maybe,

14:35.360 --> 14:38.200
you can bring them all under one roof with Rancher quite easily.

14:38.200 --> 14:43.240
You don't have to go, say, adopt the whole Red Hat OpenShift workflow just to start playing

14:43.240 --> 14:44.640
with it and figure things out.

14:44.640 --> 14:45.640
Right.

14:45.640 --> 14:50.080
It sounds like, to my understanding, Rancher can, the tools, you can run Rancher OS or

14:50.080 --> 14:54.780
you could actually run some of the tools on a distribution of your choice, and that seems

14:54.780 --> 14:57.600
to be something they intend on keeping.

14:57.600 --> 15:01.720
And I can see people liking that because you have multi-cloud support, you have multi-distro

15:01.720 --> 15:02.720
support.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.720
It really kind of gets around that lock-in issue.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.720
Right.

15:05.720 --> 15:09.440
You've got two companies joined into one with a long experience in open source and supporting

15:09.440 --> 15:14.240
things like Linux, especially at SUSE, so they've kind of just said, hey, look, we also

15:14.240 --> 15:15.640
do Kubernetes now.

15:15.640 --> 15:16.640
Yeah.

15:16.640 --> 15:22.260
The other thing about this that strikes me is SUSE, much like Red Hat, is a traditional

15:22.260 --> 15:23.620
sales channel company.

15:23.620 --> 15:27.420
They work in the sales world of enterprise.

15:27.420 --> 15:30.520
It is their meat and potatoes.

15:30.520 --> 15:34.000
It's an area where they're really competitive, and now they have a very competitive management

15:34.000 --> 15:38.020
solution as well that has some good buzz.

15:38.020 --> 15:41.760
Seems like they got pretty savvy over there at SUSE, and this is in the shadow of those

15:41.760 --> 15:46.340
recent rumors of them coming out with an IPO as well.

15:46.340 --> 15:50.220
And if they do, this just made that IPO look a lot more attractive because now they have

15:50.220 --> 15:55.020
a really modern cloud offering, which, of course, the market always likes to see.

15:55.020 --> 16:00.660
As many times as you can say, cloud or Kubernetes, all the better.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.160
Linux.ting.com.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.400
Ting Mobile is a smarter choice for everyone now.

16:04.400 --> 16:07.180
It's the next generation of Ting Mobile.

16:07.180 --> 16:09.700
It's here, and you should go see how much you can save.

16:09.700 --> 16:13.280
And you get $25 off when you go to linux.ting.com.

16:13.280 --> 16:18.380
You can get talk and text for just $10 a month and data plans starting at $15 and unlimited

16:18.380 --> 16:19.700
from $45.

16:19.700 --> 16:22.820
Yeah, I said the word unlimited.

16:22.820 --> 16:27.260
And if you use two or 20 gigs a month, there's a perfect Ting plan for you and the family.

16:27.260 --> 16:28.260
And no need to worry.

16:28.260 --> 16:30.900
The only thing that's changed is a lower monthly phone bill.

16:30.900 --> 16:36.100
You still get access to Ting's award-winning customer service with nationwide LTE and 5G

16:36.100 --> 16:39.980
coverage and no contracts ever.

16:39.980 --> 16:44.460
And Ting Mobile customers can now choose from three different plans just based on your data

16:44.460 --> 16:45.460
needs.

16:45.460 --> 16:50.380
It's really simple to switch to Ting and pretty much any phone is going to work on Ting.

16:50.380 --> 16:55.500
So just go to linux.ting.com, check out your current phone, create an account, pick the

16:55.500 --> 16:56.980
plan that's right for you.

16:56.980 --> 17:00.500
When everything all lines up, Ting will send you a SIM card that you pop in your phone

17:00.500 --> 17:02.100
and you activate in minutes.

17:02.100 --> 17:08.580
I've been a Ting customer for probably seven years, six years, it's been a long time and

17:08.580 --> 17:10.220
they've been great.

17:10.220 --> 17:12.220
And now it's the next generation of Ting.

17:12.220 --> 17:18.460
It's here and you should see how much you can save and get $25 off by going to linux.ting.com.

17:18.460 --> 17:22.220
No contracts, you pick the plan that works just right for you and you can probably bring

17:22.220 --> 17:23.220
a phone.

17:23.220 --> 17:25.380
And if you want to get a new phone, there's a lot of great phones you can get from Ting

17:25.380 --> 17:28.820
directly or grab however you like to get them and bring them.

17:28.820 --> 17:32.580
Thank you to everyone who takes advantage of our sponsor's offer and supports the show.

17:32.580 --> 17:35.740
Thanks to Ting for making it possible for this here independent podcast to be free to

17:35.740 --> 17:38.620
our listeners.

17:38.620 --> 17:44.820
Michael Larable founded Ferronix in 2004, now the largest open source news and Linux

17:44.820 --> 17:46.580
hardware review site.

17:46.580 --> 17:51.380
He also created the Ferronix test suite, a very impressive benchmarking tool that we

17:51.380 --> 17:54.200
use over on Linux Unplugged all the time.

17:54.200 --> 17:58.420
To say he knows a few things about Linux hardware is putting it lightly.

17:58.420 --> 18:03.420
Michael joined me earlier this week to discuss the state of Linux hardware support in 2020.

18:03.420 --> 18:07.820
And I had to start by asking him if he thinks it's a long shot to get Linux on the Apple

18:07.820 --> 18:10.140
M1 up and running.

18:10.140 --> 18:15.260
While I'm optimistic about in particular the one Patreon campaign happening right now by

18:15.260 --> 18:21.920
Hector, I'd view it as a long shot, at least in terms of being able to have any production

18:21.920 --> 18:27.020
quality support with working graphics in particular being the one area that will be the biggest

18:27.020 --> 18:31.300
uphill battle for bringing up Linux on the M1 for any of those devices.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.300
Right.

18:32.300 --> 18:36.340
Yeah, I look at the devices that we have had documentation and more access to and it's

18:36.340 --> 18:38.620
been an uphill battle just to get those working.

18:38.620 --> 18:39.620
Exactly.

18:39.620 --> 18:44.140
If you look at even just AMD and Intel laptops on the market these days and try to load Linux

18:44.140 --> 18:50.060
on there, there's still various quirks to work through from power management especially.

18:50.060 --> 18:54.940
And then obviously some laptops with keyboards or wireless still causing issues.

18:54.940 --> 19:00.980
And then yes, certainly even in cases of open source graphics like with Nvidia, for instance,

19:00.980 --> 19:06.220
where there have been the Nuovo developers for years working on the support, but they

19:06.220 --> 19:09.740
end up being handicapped by firmware and documentation.

19:09.740 --> 19:15.220
And so all these years later, the open source Nvidia driver performance for most of the

19:15.220 --> 19:18.320
GPUs out there is very poor.

19:18.320 --> 19:24.020
And I imagine that the M1 graphics are going to be in a very similar situation where it'll

19:24.020 --> 19:29.180
take basically years and may or may not be performant.

19:29.180 --> 19:33.460
And then the other obstacles like reverse engineering the M1 graphics will have to be

19:33.460 --> 19:39.460
done on Mac OS and that's moving increasingly towards the Metal API.

19:39.460 --> 19:45.100
And so it's going to be harder for them to basically debug and reverse engineer and replay

19:45.100 --> 19:51.140
all the shaders from Mac on Linux and basically a lot more obstacles compared to what the

19:51.140 --> 19:57.420
Nuovo developers or even PanFrost with the Armali graphics, FreeDreno for the Qualcomm

19:57.420 --> 20:04.660
Adreno, at least there they have a Linux driver currently or a kernel driver from Android

20:04.660 --> 20:08.300
and they may be able to build it and start sending in commands and trying to figure out

20:08.300 --> 20:13.780
how things work on Linux and slowly rewrite either their shader compiler and then bring

20:13.780 --> 20:16.780
up their OpenGL and Vulkan drivers.

20:16.780 --> 20:21.220
But with the Apple M1 you really don't have a good starting point on Linux unless Apple

20:21.220 --> 20:27.140
were to release a Linux driver that's closed source but I don't envision them releasing

20:27.140 --> 20:30.780
any such driver and they don't have a reason to really.

20:30.780 --> 20:35.300
I guess are prospects better for just competitive ARM that will work better with Linux?

20:35.300 --> 20:38.580
How's that looking from a hardware perspective?

20:38.580 --> 20:39.660
Certainly I would say very good.

20:39.660 --> 20:43.800
Over the next year we should see more single board computers come to market that will hopefully

20:43.800 --> 20:51.620
have the Neoverse N1 or X1 processor cores and then there's already the announced N2

20:51.620 --> 20:56.880
and other iterations coming from ARM that are certainly looking very promising.

20:56.880 --> 21:01.660
So at a minimum I would say that this Apple M1 effort would take at least a year to bring

21:01.660 --> 21:06.660
up to get into some level of usefulness for end users and yeah over the course of that

21:06.660 --> 21:11.540
same amount of time we're likely to see much more competitive ARM hardware out there which

21:11.540 --> 21:15.500
will hopefully be using our Mali graphics where you may be able to then make use of

21:15.500 --> 21:20.020
the existing PanFrost driver and there's at least some level of Linux support there thanks

21:20.020 --> 21:24.740
to the various Android devices etc.

21:24.740 --> 21:30.660
So there is much better prospect than hoping to get a very custom Apple M1 chip brought

21:30.660 --> 21:31.660
up under Linux.

21:31.660 --> 21:35.080
Well one topic that we follow on this show a lot and I know you follow it as well is

21:35.080 --> 21:41.420
RISC-V. You think this improves prospects or changes the game at all for RISC-V?

21:41.420 --> 21:44.980
I wouldn't say so at least in the near term.

21:44.980 --> 21:50.860
RISC-V is doing some excellent things particularly with Sci-5 and their recently announced developer

21:50.860 --> 21:55.460
board that will now be available at a lower cost that should really help boost the open

21:55.460 --> 22:01.100
source and ecosystem support around there now that more developers will be able to handle

22:01.100 --> 22:08.380
the cost of that board and start providing Linux build systems around there and basically

22:08.380 --> 22:10.340
porting more software over there.

22:10.340 --> 22:13.300
Let's talk a little bit more about bigger hardware and Linux.

22:13.300 --> 22:16.900
Seems like it's been a pretty good year for AMD on Linux.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.020
Oh it certainly has.

22:19.020 --> 22:25.340
AMD's recent Ryzen 5000 or Zen 3 processor launch has been terrific.

22:25.340 --> 22:31.580
20% plus generational improvements generally speaking in nearly all the workloads including

22:31.580 --> 22:33.540
single threaded.

22:33.540 --> 22:36.660
I've been super happy with the Zen 3 support on Linux.

22:36.660 --> 22:42.540
There hasn't been any issues compared to Zen 1 or Zen 2 where there was that RD-Rand instruction

22:42.540 --> 22:47.620
issue that was causing boot time problems or originally with Zen 1 where there was the

22:47.620 --> 22:54.300
issue on performance marginality problem I believe they had described it as where there

22:54.300 --> 23:01.340
was a Linux performance issue that was rather peculiar and without any new chipsets being

23:01.340 --> 23:05.780
introduced for the Zen 3 launch everything there from the motherboard perspective is

23:05.780 --> 23:11.260
quite mature and stable so you can pretty much load up a modern Linux distribution and

23:11.260 --> 23:16.500
have it run great with Ryzen 5000 and then in early 2021 there's already going to be

23:16.500 --> 23:20.820
the Ryzen 5000 mobile series that will also should be very nice.

23:20.820 --> 23:24.900
Oh I already want it.

23:24.900 --> 23:28.740
You know okay so it's been a little bit more of an interesting story wouldn't you say on

23:28.740 --> 23:33.820
the NVIDIA side they had the GPL condom issue the driver story isn't quite the same.

23:33.820 --> 23:37.140
What are your thoughts with NVIDIA and Linux for 2020?

23:37.140 --> 23:41.660
It's been an interesting year for sure at least they continue to have same day Linux

23:41.660 --> 23:47.140
driver support that generally just works without issues and you can rely on them and there's

23:47.140 --> 23:52.900
really no iffy bring up issues or anything under Linux for that proprietary driver.

23:52.900 --> 23:58.860
The RTX 30 series performs great on Linux pretty much at feature parity to Windows especially

23:58.860 --> 24:05.780
now that the Khronos group has ratified the Vulkan ray tracing extension so there's that

24:05.780 --> 24:11.500
so the ray tracing will hopefully come to Linux in some form in terms of games or Steam

24:11.500 --> 24:21.020
Play and Proton for compatibility porting of the DirectX 12 DXR to Vulkan.

24:21.020 --> 24:26.820
So from the proprietary driver side everything is great and remains great with NVIDIA.

24:26.820 --> 24:30.660
The open source side though is where it's still disappointing the Novo developers have

24:30.660 --> 24:34.580
been spending years slowly working on things.

24:34.580 --> 24:40.060
Red Hat though has been investing still in the driver which is a bit surprising they've

24:40.060 --> 24:47.380
been investing a lot in the OpenCL compute support and Spear V for a computer as well

24:47.380 --> 24:53.660
while at the same time the performance is quite poor so there's ultimately some sort

24:53.660 --> 24:58.340
of backroom deal that Red Hat is engaging with NVIDIA in terms of improving this open

24:58.340 --> 25:03.900
source driver stack and there was an announcement for GTC earlier this year that was delayed

25:03.900 --> 25:09.440
in terms of some open source driver announcement so I believe they are collaborating over some

25:09.440 --> 25:15.220
hopeful improvement which would likely be their increased documentation and or providing

25:15.220 --> 25:21.140
more open firmware so that these modern GPUs can perform well on the open source driver

25:21.140 --> 25:25.460
but at this point it's really up in the air and just speculating on what it could be but

25:25.460 --> 25:29.760
given that Red Hat for years now has been investing and continues to have full-time

25:29.760 --> 25:36.640
developers working on the driver there has to be some sort of plan at play.

25:36.640 --> 25:41.800
So before we go let me ask you about what you're watching for 2021 it sounds like I

25:41.800 --> 25:46.080
got a hint earlier but what else are you keeping an eye out for?

25:46.080 --> 25:52.460
It'll be fun to see what exactly happens with Linux on the M1 it's gonna be a lengthy bring-up

25:52.460 --> 25:57.260
process should it all pan out I wouldn't be surprised if in even weeks they might manage

25:57.260 --> 26:02.660
to get Linux to boot on the M1 but in terms of it being a polished experience especially

26:02.660 --> 26:09.720
on the graphic side it's a very long process I'd see more success there in getting Linux

26:09.720 --> 26:13.740
virtualized on macOS and there you won't have to worry about power management and all the

26:13.740 --> 26:20.760
other peculiarities on the software side Intel continues to do interesting investments in

26:20.760 --> 26:25.460
Linux performance with Clear Linux but that's sort of been going downhill recently since

26:25.460 --> 26:29.740
they divested in their desktop focus earlier this year and there really hasn't been too

26:29.740 --> 26:36.740
much out of Intel on the past several months so we'll see what happens there but at least

26:36.740 --> 26:40.820
in general Intel is still doing a lot of interesting Linux work they remain one of the largest

26:40.820 --> 26:46.580
contributors to the Linux kernel and bringing up their hardware functionally to ensure that

26:46.580 --> 26:53.180
it performs well on Linux at the time of launch and is in release distributions etc Ubuntu

26:53.180 --> 26:58.460
has been doing fairly well these days with a lot of upstream improvements to GNOME and

26:58.460 --> 27:04.620
other components and so overall it's going to be a very interesting 2021 for a variety

27:04.620 --> 27:10.800
of reasons both on the hardware and software side and I don't really see any major challenge

27:10.800 --> 27:15.180
as I think it's going to be fascinating hardware year maybe one of our better ones yet and

27:15.180 --> 27:21.660
I thought 2020 was pretty good oh yeah certainly so and then just for instance yeah more ARM

27:21.660 --> 27:27.180
hardware currently I'm testing the Ampere Ultra which is a ARM v8 server with the remaking

27:27.180 --> 27:33.780
is the NEOVERSE N1 design and that performance has actually been phenomenal it's arguably

27:33.780 --> 27:37.980
even more impressive than the M1 I'll bet in the server space I'll have benchmarks there

27:37.980 --> 27:43.460
in the coming weeks but basically in a number of workloads the Ampere Ultra can actually

27:43.460 --> 27:50.540
take on Intel's top-end 8280 Platinum configuration as well as how many cores how many ARM cores

27:50.540 --> 27:55.900
are we talking here 80 cores per socket and so if you go with and that's physical cores

27:55.900 --> 28:02.500
there's no hyper threading SMT involved so with a dual socket server like Mount Jade

28:02.500 --> 28:10.260
you have 160 cores and I'm glad to hear that can take on the M1 but yeah even there though

28:10.260 --> 28:15.680
it does show that there are more improvements to be made on the Linux software stack there's

28:15.680 --> 28:20.260
still plenty of Linux software out there that really isn't optimized for ARM v8 sure it

28:20.260 --> 28:26.740
can build but there's plenty of software not making use of ARM SIMD extensions with NEON

28:26.740 --> 28:32.660
or just well-tuned for ARM so hopefully that will be an area that will improve upon in

28:32.660 --> 28:36.580
2021 yeah I'll be watching and actually I'm sure you will be too and we'll be watching

28:36.580 --> 28:39.980
Foronix for the coverage so thank you for the great work and keep it up thank you it's

28:39.980 --> 28:45.700
