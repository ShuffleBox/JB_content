00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,360
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open-source world.

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,200
This is episode 15, recorded on August 20th, 2017. I'm Chris.

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,200
And I'm Joe.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:27,080
Hello, Joe, and my podcast-tuned ears tell me that sounds a bit like a hotel room. Are

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,600
you still at Ogg Camp over there?

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,760
I am still at Ogg Camp, yes. I've been there all day yesterday and all day today.

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,760
How's it been going?

8
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,240
Yeah, it's been going great. And I'm going to be going out for the social event tonight

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,240
as well, Sunday night as we record this in the UK. But it's been really good. I've seen

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:49,520
a bunch of talks about loads of random stuff. But I think one of the good ones for me was

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,840
Richard Brown from OpenSUSE. He gave a really comprehensive overview of how the project

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,160
works and how it ties in with SLE, the enterprise version and stuff. And that was really good.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:10,440
And also, he did one today, a shorter talk about OpenQA and how that relates to Tumbleweed

14
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,440
and why they think that's the best way to do a distro, which is a little bit controversial

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:20,360
to say that a rolling release is better than the snapshot releases that Ubuntu do.

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,720
That does sound pretty interesting. And it sounds like also a few shows got produced

17
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,640
while you're there. So there's some content out of OggCamp people can look forward to

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,920
if they go check out late night Linux. So overall, pretty productive, Joe.

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,640
Yeah, so far so good.

20
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,920
Of course, there's another group of folks that are having a party this week. And that's

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,680
Gnome. Gnome has officially turned 20, Joe.

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,520
Yeah, can you believe it's that old as a project?

23
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,440
It kind of makes me feel old. I know that's a selfish take on it. But that was my first

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,480
thought is, whoa, wait, what? 20 years? Oh, no.

25
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,800
Yeah. And Debian has turned 24.

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,560
1993. That was the first release of Debian. Unbelievable. 24 years of Debian, 20 years

27
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,760
of Gnome, two projects that have had a huge role in my Linux usage. Debian Day. What do

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,080
you think of that, Joe? We should start celebrating Debian Day.

29
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:09,880
Yeah, we should definitely. Maybe we can convert a few people, maybe.

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,920
Speaking of Debian, there's a bit of a remix for the Raspberry Pi that's got an update.

31
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,120
Yeah, the previous version of Raspberry Pi was based on Jessie. And now they have updated

32
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,880
it to Stretch. So it's kind of up to date now. And there's not anything massively different

33
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:31,120
in there. You've got new versions of things, new PHP. And some of the kind of core apps

34
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,920
have been updated, like Sonic Pi has been updated to version three now.

35
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Yeah.

36
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,780
Which is a major update for that. That's got a lot of new features on there. But in this

37
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:52,480
blog post about it, Simon Long was talking about how he's fixed some issues with passwordless

38
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,280
pseudo and the fact that the default user is Pi. And if you change that, then some applications

39
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,680
don't like it. And he's kind of fixed that. But to me, that just highlights that I just

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,280
don't think that it's put together very well, that distro. I think that having a default

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,760
username and password, and you can change it, but it doesn't prompt you to do that,

42
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:21,520
or at least not in very overt terms. And then to have pseudo with no password, it just seems

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,720
like it's security and usability are always a balance, right? But in this case, I just

44
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,480
feel that they've got that balance wrong for me. And that's why I would always use Ubuntu

45
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,060
Mate on the Pi.

46
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,320
One thing that was a red flag to me, and it's absolutely their choice to go this route,

47
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:43,080
but they've ripped PulseAudio out. And that to me was a bit of a red flag. When you roll

48
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,760
backwards, that's generally not something that's sustainable. I remember a time in Linux

49
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,520
where only one application could use your audio interface at a time. And if you had

50
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,300
something playing sound, that's all you could listen to. So when we start to slide backwards

51
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,120
in audio, it does make me a little concerned. I'm not saying PulseAudio is the best thing

52
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,160
ever, but just completely ripping it out and then saying, oh, if you need that, just install

53
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:12,600
it yourself, seems a little bit of a backwards approach. Maybe, I don't know. Maybe I don't

54
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,360
have extensive use with it on the Raspberry Pi. So maybe this is the right move. But that

55
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,000
was a red flag to your point.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,480
Yeah. And another regression is, well, I suppose a change. Do you remember when they made a

57
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,640
theme for LXDE and started calling it a desktop environment and called it Pixel?

58
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Yeah.

59
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:35,320
And I pointed out to them that that was probably not such a good idea because of the Google

60
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
Pixel.

61
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,320
Sure.

62
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,960
And that they might have trademark issues. And they said, oh, it's fine. Don't worry.

63
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,240
It's totally different. Well, now they have silently rebranded it as Raspberry Pi Desktop

64
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,760
and not a single mention of Pixel on their website anymore, apart from the old article.

65
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,480
That's a good move, though. We don't know why, although I think your reason might be

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,160
it. But that is a good move on their part.

67
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,280
Well, I asked Ben Nuttall, the community manager. He did a lightning talk at OggCamp yesterday.

68
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,480
And I asked him that very question. And he just took his phone out of his pocket and

69
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:12,560
held it up as to why they've rebranded away from Pixel.

70
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
Was it a Pixel?

71
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,560
I believe so, yeah.

72
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,040
That's I think you nailed it then.

73
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,200
I suspect they got a letter from Google, but he wouldn't say for definite.

74
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,400
Yeah. So here's something then that's good. Let's end on a positive note with our coverage

75
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:33,100
of this. They have a fix for that Broadcom 43 wireless chipset that ships on the Raspberry

76
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,160
Pi 3 and Pi 0. It potentially allowed an attacker to take over the chip and execute code on

77
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,800
it. And this stretch release includes a patch to address that vulnerability. That's a pretty

78
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,920
important fix and a good reason to update.

79
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,720
Yeah. And to be fair, one thing that is quite impressive about this distro is that it will

80
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,040
work on any Raspberry Pi, from the very first one on the zeros, on the two, the three. And

81
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,920
it'll just work regardless of which Pi you have, which is not something that can be said

82
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,400
for any other OS. So fair play to them on that one.

83
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,900
Yeah, I agree. Just because Debian's 24 years old doesn't mean they're sitting still and

84
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:14,740
enjoying the architectures and systems they already run great on. Work continues for Debian

85
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,740
on mobile devices.

86
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,040
Yeah, it's easy to forget that you can actually run a proper GNU slash Linux distro on some

87
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:28,340
of these portable devices, including the Pocket Chip, which is a pretty cool little computer.

88
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,960
And even a phone, Zero phone, which is based on the Raspberry Pi Zero.

89
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,960
Very geeky phone.

90
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,880
Yeah, yeah. The thing is that with the death of Ubuntu phone and Firefox OS, you kind of

91
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,320
think that all hope is lost and Android is the only way if you want Linux on a kind of

92
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,400
embedded small device. But it's good to see that Debian is actually working on this stuff

93
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,760
and hasn't forgotten about it.

94
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,200
I agree. And there's actually a device shipping soon that looks really compelling that'll

95
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:02,000
ship with Debian. The Pandora folks are getting ready to ship the Pyra. I think I'm saying

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,480
that right. P-Y-R-A. It's a 5-inch LCD touchscreen. It has gaming controls on it, but it also

97
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:16,200
has a full QWERTY little mini keyboard. It looks about the size of a older Nintendo 3DS.

98
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,800
It has a 1.5 gigahertz dual-core ARM CPU, which you could upgrade and get up to 4 gigs

99
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,320
of RAM, backlit keyboard. And yeah, Debian pre-installed on these. And these guys have

100
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,340
a history of shipping. It's a pretty compelling little device. And if you want something super

101
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,560
mobile, I like it. And Joe, you'll like this too, at least in the screenshots. It's run

102
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
on XFCE.

103
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,080
Well, it's the only desktop that makes sense.

104
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,600
So there's actually a few. When you stop thinking about the consumer handhelds like the Galaxy

105
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,520
phones and the Nexus phones, and you start thinking about these really awesome geeky

106
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,760
devices that, honestly, only a niche is going to want to buy, but that's fine. Debian starts

107
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,720
to make a lot of sense here. The Xero phone was an interesting one, but also they're working

108
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,160
on the Samsung Galaxy S Relay 4G. Now, I just said don't target consumer phones, but if

109
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,320
you do need something that can make calls for some reason, and you want something running

110
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,080
Debian, that's also going to be an option. But the pirate in me had the most compelling

111
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,960
feature set, a really nice modular handheld computer with gaming controls, Wi-Fi, multiple

112
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,600
SD card slots, USB ports. You can get it in Europe or the US, and it's going to be pre-loaded

113
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,640
with Debian. The only downside, when I started to get a little bit more interested in it

114
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:41,040
and looked at the pre-orders, the one I would want with four gigs of RAM is about $670 US.

115
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:45,960
A little too expensive for me. Yeah. Well, it's funny, kind of related. While I've been

116
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,080
here at Oddcamp, I got my hands on the GPD Pocket briefly. What do you think? Its build

117
00:08:51,080 --> 00:09:00,560
quality is brilliant. It's milled aluminum. It feels like a MacBook Pro type, but software-wise,

118
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,760
it doesn't really work with certainly the LTS version of Ubuntu that was on there. Also,

119
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,380
when I put it down on the table, it turned itself off and on again because of a loose

120
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:15,160
connector in there. There's some quality control issues by the looks of things, but I really

121
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,560
want one. If they weren't so expensive, I kind of wish I'd backed it now, but you see

122
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,600
it all at Oddcamp. It's brilliant. There's another device coming out soon that is sort

123
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,120
of making me also interested. This space is really starting to get interesting. My better

124
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,280
sense says, wait another generation. That's what my better sense tells me, but my early

125
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,240
adopter sense says, jump in now. It's obviously getting more and more interesting. We'll have

126
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,920
some links in the show notes if you guys want to check it out, but in the meantime, those

127
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,800
of us that have existing devices and nothing's really compelling to us, that's the situation

128
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,600
I find myself in with my Nexus 6P. Lineage is starting to look more and more attractive,

129
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,440
and they've recently launched a summer survey that I have to be honest with you, Joe. After

130
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,740
I started taking the survey, even though I'm not a recent lineage user, it actually made

131
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,400
me want to use lineage more and more. I hadn't realized how great it's gotten, and just looking

132
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,300
at some of the questions in the survey, it's really standing out.

133
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,180
I haven't used anything else apart from it. Well, I used Android Ice Cold, which is based

134
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:19,880
on it, for a while, but as soon as I bought my OnePlus 3T a couple of weeks ago, literally

135
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,080
the first thing I did was flash lineage on it.

136
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,460
Yeah, you did. That is the fact I remember. It was basically, hey, I got this, and it's

137
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:32,660
already running lineage, which is pretty funny. There was no gap. For me, I've just got the

138
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,800
Nexus line of devices because I wanted to just get it directly from Google, and I thought

139
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:42,080
if I'm going to be on an Android device, I should just run as close to what Google envisions

140
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,160
for Android as possible.

141
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,680
What I've discovered by that is it's not good enough, and it's boring, and I don't use my

142
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,900
Nexus 6P as much. Lineage seems like a great way to sort of inject a little bit of life

143
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,820
back into the device and make it a little more compelling again.

144
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,840
The survey is linked in the show notes. If you're a lineage user and you want to give

145
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,600
them your thoughts, they're calling it their summer survey, and they have divided it into

146
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,920
five areas, apps, wallpapers, features, infrastructure, and how they handle public relations. So it's

147
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:17,320
worth checking out lineageos.org slash summer dash survey, or go over to linuxactionnews.com

148
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,560
slash 15 and find the link in the show notes.

149
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,600
Yeah, and the thing is that you have no right to complain about a project if you don't take

150
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,240
part in these surveys. I will always do a survey if I can because that's the best way

151
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:36,320
to give them direct feedback, crowdsourced info and opinions. So if you do use Lineage,

152
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,820
then I urge you do go and fill this out and help them out. It's a very simple way to give

153
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:46,240
them a couple of minutes of your time to really help the project out.

working on your project. DigitalOcean.com promo code, here's the thing. Everything uses

160
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,680
SSDs, they have a simple API, they have highly available block storage, lightning fast networking

161
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,760
with private networking that doesn't count against your transfer, which is really brilliant.

162
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,040
If you have a front end proxy server connecting to back end web servers or doing backups on

163
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,000
their back end, that private networking is over their data center land too, so it's crazy

164
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,240
fast. They have load balancing as a service, team support if you want to work with a group,

165
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,000
and monitoring and alerting to make you look like a boss. DigitalOcean.com, use our promo

168
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,760
One of the projects that I've been watching closely for a few years now is Solus, and

169
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:59,240
this week they've come out with Solus 3. Now, full disclosure, Aiki, the founder and lead

170
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,040
developer of Solus, is on my other podcast, Late Night Linux, so I'm pretty much bound

171
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,800
to say good things about it, but this is a really solid release.

172
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,560
Yeah, this is the third iteration of Solus since they've moved to a rolling release,

173
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,240
and I wanted to watch this kind of come out a couple of times after that transition, and

174
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,600
it was this one that made me install it on the machine I'm sitting in front of right

175
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,060
now, which is one of my most important machines in the studio. They've moved from a regular

176
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,880
snapshot model that a lot of traditional distributions take, and they've now gone with sort of a

177
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,560
hybrid curated rolling release model, and that works perfect for me because it keeps

178
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,200
the applications fresh. I've opted to use the LTS kernel and the LTS video drivers,

179
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,600
so those remain constant and stable, and I think it's a really good balance for me. This

180
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:52,320
is also the first release of Solus to ship with an LSM by default. The Linux security

181
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,320
models like SE Linux or App Armor that are essentially a control list or a control system

182
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,980
that prevent applications from going outside certain boundaries, and Solus hadn't really

183
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,560
picked a horse in that race, and now they've chosen App Armor, and by shipping App Armor

184
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,360
by default, they've also brought in a bunch of the support they need to ship really good

185
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,680
Snap support, like great, essentially Ubuntu-level Snap support with full confinement using the

186
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,960
Linux security module within their own kernel, which this module happens to be App Armor

187
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,680
to use Snap. So now we have complete Flatpak with confinement support and Snaps with confinement

188
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,880
support on Solus, which is great for users of the operating system that might want to

189
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,320
install something that isn't in their curated repository.

190
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,840
Well that was one of the biggest criticisms to date of Solus, that the repo is relatively

191
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:51,400
small compared to Debian or Ubuntu, for example, and now this basically takes care of that,

192
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,040
or it certainly will in the future.

193
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,080
Yeah I am looking forward to adding support for a couple of applications I don't think

194
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,400
they would ever want to package, maybe things that run more as a server with NGINX, and

195
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,080
I'm thinking of certain Usenet clients and whatnot that I just don't think would ever

196
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,120
end up in the user repository for Solus. So this is pretty cool, it also represents some

197
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,840
pretty great cross-platform collaboration between the canonical Snapcraft folks and Solus, which

198
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,080
we got a little bit of the backstory on last week's Linux Unplugged from Wimpy and iKey,

199
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,400
which sounded like essentially they just had to kind of point him in the right direction

200
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,160
and he was able to roll all this in, but fascinating nonetheless.

201
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,760
Not to focus too much on Snaps because there's a ton of other pretty great features in their

202
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:38,240
custom desktop budgie 10.4, which has new animations, a new alt tab, a new nightlight

203
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,320
feature that changes the color tones at night, all other kinds of really nice things including

204
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,880
modifications to the menu that I really appreciate as a new adopter of the budgie desktop.

205
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,520
Not to mention the most important thing, to put the panel in the correct place at last

206
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,440
on the bottom.

207
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,800
You know I read somebody say on the internet recently that Solus is one of the most newsworthy

208
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,600
Linux distributions, and I have to agree. There's a lot happening here, and it's been

209
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,960
fascinating to watch it for a little while myself.

210
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,840
Yeah, it seems like we were right when we said that once iKey goes full time, development's

211
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,640
going to accelerate, and it's just gone at an amazing speed. It was already going pretty

212
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,560
quickly and it was already quite newsworthy, but it seems like iKey's going to be providing

213
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,800
us with news for weeks and months and years to come.

214
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,520
I totally agree. In fact, I'm looking forward to it. It's one of the reasons I installed

215
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,060
it. I'm also always following news around the ZFS file system and getting better support

216
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,620
for ZFS on Linux, and finally it looks like we might be getting decent encryption support.

217
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,920
Which I would have thought for certain enterprise use cases is absolutely essential.

218
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,360
I wonder how many people encrypt their NASs or their SANs in an enterprise. People listening,

219
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,000
I'd like to know. Tweet us at Linux Action News or at ChrisLAS and let me know. Do you

220
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,280
encrypt your data center storage? I could definitely picture encrypting any mediums

221
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:06,000
that leave the data center, like backup drives or tapes or absolutely laptops, but large,

222
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,760
large storage volumes. Do people actively encrypt those? I'm not sure.

223
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,040
I would have thought so with certain areas like banking and where it's really critical

224
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,040
security.

225
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:21,080
Yeah, you definitely have controls around the data and restrictions and lots of protection,

226
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,560
but encryption at rest comes with a pretty big considerable overhead when you have high

227
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:31,000
usage applications hitting that drive a lot. So there's a big cost to doing that. I don't

228
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,960
know. Maybe I'm a little old school on this, but to me it seems like you definitely encrypt

229
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,720
the network during transit. You definitely encrypt any data leaving the data center,

230
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:46,240
absolutely. But often on the LAN itself, you just manage it with access control lists and

231
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,000
file permissions.

232
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,760
So I wonder if it hasn't been a big concern for Linux. But they have been working on it

233
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,600
for months. The patches go back for months and months, and it was just really until this

234
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,800
last week that they felt like it was matured enough for merging into the upstream code.

235
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,440
So you're going to have to wait for these updates to come downstream to you, but there's

236
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,440
16,000 new lines of code. There's a fun fact along with this new Linux encryption support

237
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,440
on ZFS.

238
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,920
Yeah, so I wonder if this is one more small nail in B-tree FS's coffin. What do you think?

239
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:24,760
I'm going to take the other side on that now. I think ButterFS is essentially untouchable.

240
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,320
All of the shots that it can be, it's not dead yet, Joe. It's just a flesh wound and

241
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,220
it's still going. Because where it's useful, there's certain NAS devices that ship it by

242
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:40,400
default on the NAS hard drives. There is certain large Linux distributions out there that insist

243
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,800
on shipping it. And there's certain crazy data mining corporations that run it on their

244
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,520
edge network. They'll probably continue to do that for years.

245
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,560
Yeah, well, SUSE are all in on it. Their whole basically update strategy relies on it because

246
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:58,080
you need to have the rollback and they're not going to ship ZFS. They've made that very

247
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,520
clear. So I think, yeah, even if it's only SUSE using it, it's going to stick around.

248
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,840
Yeah, I'm glad because then we can really have a good turf war. Now we can have ZFS

249
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,000
folks against ButterFS folks. And meanwhile, us Stratus hipsters over here will really

250
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,200
have the high and mighty attitudes.

251
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,000
Well, I'm just sitting here using XT4, what can I say?

252
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,360
There's also a little upset in the Bitcoin community. Another fork is coming. Yes, we

253
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,080
know there was just another fork. Bitcoin Cash just happened. On Wednesday, a group

254
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,160
of Bitcoiners scheduled yet another split for the network in November, which would create

255
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,340
a third version of Bitcoin. Now the date's not set yet because it's based on the number

256
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,200
of blocks. So once they reach a certain block number, the split happens.

257
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,680
And so this all comes down to Segregated Witness, doesn't it? Which is a feature that was being

258
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,640
debated as to whether they were going to implement it and it was going to help with this block

259
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:02,240
size problem. And so it was implemented into the main Bitcoin, but that wasn't enough to

260
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,540
stop the fork of Bitcoin Cash where they just said, we don't care about Segregated Witness.

261
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:11,800
We just want a bigger block size. And now this other fork is people want both. They

262
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:17,040
want a bigger block size and Segregated Witness to basically optimize the block size as much

263
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
as possible.

264
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:25,320
It's going by two names, SigWit2x and BTC1, I believe. And its two main differences would

265
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:31,840
be a two megabyte block size versus OG Bitcoin's one megabyte. And it would also include the

266
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,880
new Segregated Witness. But that's not the interesting part about any of this. The interesting

267
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:44,040
part about this is how fired up the Bitcoin community is. This appears to be a much bigger

268
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:50,640
deal than the last split. And it's potentially going to be much more noticeable. There is

269
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:57,040
a bunch of Bitcoin Core developers and Bitcoin Core community members who are very vocal.

270
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Henry Braid is one of these. A vocal person that's been promoting Bitcoin since 2011.

271
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:08,640
He's a frequent speaker at events. He's very knowledgeable about Bitcoin and the blockchain.

272
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,960
And he tweeted this morning, the SigWit2x hard fork scheduled for November is an attempted

273
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:21,760
hostile corporate takeover of the Bitcoin protocol. Fight it and educate people.

274
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,400
They're saying that New York business interests are coming out and it may even be a state

275
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:34,000
takeover. And meanwhile, the SigWit2x folks are saying we have 80% of the hashing power.

276
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,280
We have these former core developers on our side. Let's give this a go and let's see just

277
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:46,360
where the cards lie. And it's getting really volatile back and forth. This is the interesting

278
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
fork.

279
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,120
Yeah, because Bitcoin Cash, it's not done massively well. It's done better than I expected,

280
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:57,860
I must say, but people have just kept using Bitcoin basically. So you think that now this

281
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:01,880
might be serious, that people might actually start using this other fork?

282
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:08,340
I think it could be the combination effect of Bitcoin Cash and SigWit2x. Bitcoin Cash,

283
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:13,480
if you mine, is more profitable right now than original Bitcoin. So if you're in the

284
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,520
mining game, you can actually make more money with Bitcoin Cash. So that's going to eat

285
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,100
away a bit of Bitcoin. And then SigWit2x comes along with their two megabyte blocks and segregated

286
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:28,940
witness and big professional slick industry backing, quote unquote, the corporate people

287
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,920
that are trying to take it over. It could be really appealing. And if you get companies

288
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,920
like Coinbase and Bitpay, who is Bitpay is one of the big companies behind this, this

289
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,520
could by default just become the elephant in the room, could suck all of the oxygen.

290
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,420
I can't think of another metaphor. Could snuff, no, got nothing, Joe. But there's a lot of

291
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,740
metaphors you could throw at this. Like there's this the metaphor, the metaphor potential

292
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,740
is high.

293
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,520
Yeah, it's we live in fascinating times with the whole Bitcoin thing. I'm just waiting

294
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,540
for it to crash so I can invest again, because it seems to go up, crash right and then go

295
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,980
up and go even higher than it was before.

296
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,380
Those of us that follow Bitcoin call that a sale. Yeah, there's a you're waiting for

297
