00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,400
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:22,120
This is episode 88, recorded on January 13th, 2019.

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,120
I'm Chris.

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,120
And I'm Joe.

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,120
Hello, Joe.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,200
It's good to be connected with you.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:32,400
In fact, it's good for all of us because soon we may get to choose our own Linux on Chrome

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,240
OS, which is based on Linux.

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Linuxception.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,600
Yeah, this thing that was formerly called Crostini, which is now just called Linux on

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,240
Chrome OS, means that you can use Debian apps within Chrome OS, but now they are looking

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,560
to expand that to be different distros.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,300
It's not going to be particularly easy to do it.

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,860
It's going to take a bit of admin skill.

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:06,280
But then I suppose the kind of people who are looking to install these Linux apps probably

16
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
have those skills.

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
Well, here's the details.

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,440
I was reading through how they're going to do this.

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:15,560
And it's really down to device administrators, they'll be able to designate a URL for Chrome

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,680
OS to download the Linux distro of choice, and then does a hash to make sure it got the

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,280
right file.

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,240
And if you need it, it's also intended for a license key to get that you can fetch a

23
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,400
license key from that URL to be present.

24
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,360
I don't know what that license key is going to be used for.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,100
And it's not quite clear if you need to make modifications to a specific Linux OS or distro

26
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,560
to get it to work on the Chrome OS Crostini environment.

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,280
But the basic principles are put it up on an HTTP location, give the URL via the device

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,640
administrator tool.

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,720
And then Chrome OS when you go to install Linux support when you when you go to enable

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,660
that as a user just pulls it from that location and loads it.

31
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,960
And then it's just part of regular old Chrome OS.

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,640
So it looks like to start with, at least this is only going to be available to managed users.

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,120
So it's not going to be for everyone.

34
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,480
Yeah, I wouldn't be too surprised though, if people on the internet figure out a way

35
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,600
to get to that parameter.

36
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,040
They've already, they quote unquote, the people on the internet have already looked through

37
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,080
the available beta source code.

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,360
And there doesn't really seem to be a way at first pass.

39
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,940
But I feel confident that they'll figure that out.

40
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,520
In a few months, we may even have a story that reads something like Chrome OS subreddit

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,640
figures out how to custom specify a URL for Linux distro.

42
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,960
I have a sense it's gonna happen.

43
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,640
The question I have is why do you need to have different distros supported as opposed

44
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,240
to Debian?

45
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,800
What is there that's available for other distros that isn't available for Debian?

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,120
Apart from some of the proprietary stuff, maybe?

47
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,440
I think you got to keep in mind the audience for this feature, which is developers.

48
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,880
So it isn't so much about the application availability, like if you're just using this

49
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,880
to install GIMP, it probably doesn't matter.

50
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,240
But if you're using this to actually build software, you want a specific environment.

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,700
That's why the Windows subsystem for Linux exists.

52
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,000
You want maybe an Ubuntu environment if you're deploying on an Ubuntu server up in the cloud.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,720
That's the angle the Sputnik team went after with the Dell XPS 13 and Windows subsystem,

54
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,800
like I mentioned, and I think what made the MacBook so popular amongst web developers

55
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,280
is you get the command line, you get something that you can easily SSH into, and now the

56
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,560
next stage of that that is taking what really made MacBooks popular is now you can have

57
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,600
your own environment.

58
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,440
So it's not just a Bash shell anymore.

59
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,080
It's a Bash shell in your preferred development environment.

60
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,080
I don't know.

61
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,440
Maybe that's really, really valuable.

62
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,240
Maybe but I always come back to the same argument of if you want a proper GNU slash Linux laptop,

63
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:42,480
then buy one from Dell or System76 or Entryware or whatever.

64
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:50,200
Why bother buying Chrome OS and then trying to kind of force this potentially quite sketchy

65
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,680
Linux app support on top of it?

66
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,840
Surely Chrome OS should just stay as this simplified platform and then we've got a proper

67
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,600
GNU slash Linux for everyone else.

68
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,280
Yeah, good points.

69
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,440
And I have to say, I really like seeing Linux be a headline feature that all these companies

70
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,140
are going after to add to their platforms.

71
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,600
That's pretty cool to watch.

72
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,000
But there is that skeptical side of me that looks at this and I think, who's the target

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,080
market?

74
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,280
It seems like it's too simple of an operating system.

75
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,900
Chrome OS is too simple and you wouldn't really want to build software on a Chromebook.

76
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,920
That's going to be slow and not very appealing.

77
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,480
You would probably just end up SSHing into your development box and doing the work on

78
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,320
a much more powerful system.

79
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,120
I don't quite get it.

80
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,520
On the flip side, I want this feature as an end user.

81
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,720
I'm looking forward to trying this out someday on a Chromebook.

82
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,040
I've never really considered getting one, but this is kind of pushing me over the edge.

83
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,360
It does make me a bit sad though that this is how Linux on the desktop has succeeded

84
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:55,320
in this totally lockdown controlled by Google way and that they're kind of feeding us piecemeal

85
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,920
little bits here and there, network, file, share support, and then Linux app support

86
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,080
and then other distros and it's kind of all on their terms rather than with traditional

87
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,600
desktop Linux where we've just had so much choice and control and that control has just

88
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,840
been given away to Google and I just wish that this isn't how desktop Linux had succeeded.

89
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,680
In some ways, I'd rather it not succeed than succeed like this.

90
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,200
Well, the good news is we still have traditional desktop Linux.

91
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,220
So for those of us that want that feature set, it's not going away anytime soon.

92
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,760
But I think we've always wondered what was going to be the success pathway for desktop

93
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,140
Linux to get into consumers' hands.

94
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:41,080
Who was going to put hardware in stores and incentivize salesmen to actually sell it?

95
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,000
Who was going to subsidize the hardware so it could be competitive in a low-end consumer

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,320
market where they're not willing to spend very much money?

97
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,160
And what company would have the development resources to build that platform?

98
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,200
The number of companies that can do that in 2019 and in 2018 and the last few years is

99
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:05,000
about five and one of them is Google.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,480
I just can't see another pathway to mainstream consumers without going through one of the

101
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,320
top six or so tech companies at this point.

102
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,620
Maybe if Amazon had done something like this.

103
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:22,360
And I think in the end, users are generally better off with the exception of all of the

104
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:30,240
horribly disturbing privacy violations that really could have their own weekly news podcast.

105
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,200
And for those of us who still want traditional private, secure, customizable, enterprise-grade

106
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,440
Linux, it's going to be out there.

107
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,720
Yeah, that's true.

108
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,560
And most of those distros are going to be developed on GitHub, aren't they?

109
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,200
Hey-oh, yeah, well, if Microsoft has their way.

110
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:52,200
And here we are, early 2019, and Microsoft is already just wrecking GitHub by announcing

111
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,720
two major updates that frankly make it more accessible to developers.

112
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,800
Unlimited free private repositories and a new simpler enterprise offering.

113
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,760
You can't really argue with free, Joe.

114
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,760
I know.

115
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,240
You can't argue with that.

116
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,080
You do have to wonder why they've done it.

117
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,440
And it's presumably because of the success of GitLab.

118
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,760
And I think this will attract people over.

119
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,760
It's these free private repos, it's only for small teams.

120
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,360
So you can only have three people at once contributing to them.

121
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,560
So it's not really going to cost them that much money, but I think it is going to earn

122
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,440
them quite a lot of goodwill amongst kind of small-time hobbyists and whatnot.

123
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Yep.

124
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,520
And I think Microsoft can afford to do this.

125
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,920
And it was the reason, well, one of three reasons that I was paying for GitHub.

126
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,320
I have private repositories that I use for notes.

127
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,840
I have note apps that saved to GitHub for me.

128
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,280
I don't really need that to be public.

129
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,380
And there's nothing really all that interesting in there.

130
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,080
So I paid for a GitHub account to have a private repo.

131
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,240
I don't really need to do that when my renew comes up.

132
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,280
I can use it for free now.

133
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,480
I think this is a good move to keep GitHub competitive.

134
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,800
I don't think it's a game changer, but I think it's a necessary move for them to stay competitive.

135
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,420
And it shows that they're willing to still be nimble.

136
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,400
This enterprise stuff, it's nice.

137
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,620
They have a new unified product for Enterprise Cloud, which used to be called GitHub Business

138
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,120
Cloud, and their new Enterprise Server update, which all looks really good.

139
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,760
They're doing the right stuff for business and for the general public.

140
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,760
But you're right.

141
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,040
This isn't a game changer, but it's good to see.

142
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,960
Well, something that assured it's going to be a game changer is that Homebrew has now

143
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,140
come to Linux.

144
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,080
Had you even really heard of Homebrew before this story?

145
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,760
Yeah, I'd heard of it, but I'd not used it.

146
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,300
It's traditionally how you manage software on a Mac if you are nerdy and want to install

147
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,620
things like Git and whatnot.

148
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,040
If you're a command line person on the Mac, then you use Homebrew.

149
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,640
Yeah, I mean, the Mac doesn't really have a traditional package manager like we think

150
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
of.

151
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,240
They have a way to install packages, but it's not connected to like an online repo where

152
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,200
you can search for packages and then update all your packages on the command line.

153
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,440
So Homebrew was exactly that.

154
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,040
It was a package manager developed by the community, and it's been around for a while.

155
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,200
It's pretty good for what you get, it's got a pretty good software selection, and it stays

156
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,040
fairly up to date on everything.

157
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,480
It makes using the Mac tolerable, to be honest with you.

158
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,920
But things are now changing a bit, because with the new release, version 1.90, they have

159
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,760
added Homebrew on Linux, known as Linuxbrew, and this also includes support for the Windows

160
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,920
subsystem for Linux, which means technically Homebrew has now also come to Windows 10.

161
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,960
So you might be asking, why would I want Homebrew on Linux?

162
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,160
Good question.

163
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,280
It's really all about not having to have root access.

164
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,000
That's really what it comes down to.

165
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,220
If you're on like a shared system where you don't have root access, Homebrew can just

166
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,220
run out of your home directory.

167
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,440
So you can have a pretty functional package manager without having to have administrative

168
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,800
access to the box.

169
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,340
It can either be installed in your home directory, which is nice.

170
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:11,040
It may include when you install it recent versions of glibc and gcc, depending on how

171
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,120
old your distro is, which is another nice thing about Homebrew.

172
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,560
If you have a super out of date distro, it may still be supported by Homebrew.

173
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,080
And you can install packages via Homebrew that don't conflict with your operating system

174
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,080
packages.

175
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,200
It can get a little messy, but I assume if you're running a rig like that, you know what

176
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
you're doing.

177
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,520
And so depending on how old your rig is, it may pull down its own libraries, or it may

178
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,440
just use your system version, and keeps them all in your home directory, unless you specify

179
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
otherwise.

180
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,480
And it makes it nice and easy and tidy.

181
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,520
It's worth mentioning it's beta support right now in version 2.0.

182
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,200
They plan to land official Linux support.

183
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,460
You know what I would use it is I tried out those Amazon virtual Linux desktops.

184
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,460
They're pretty neat.

185
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,800
We talked about it weeks and weeks and weeks ago on Linux Action News.

186
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,160
And the thing is, is it has a very limited package set.

187
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,400
And you could load this on one of those instances, one of those virtual desktops, and just start

188
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,360
installing packages all day long.

189
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
That's pretty neat.

190
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,360
Well, speaking of Amazon, I think the only way I can describe the next story is shots

191
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,920
fired at MongoDB.

192
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
Savage.

193
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,120
It's a savage move by Amazon.

194
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:20,200
They basically set up their own MongoDB ripoff called AWS DocumentDB, and I predict it's

195
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,640
going to be a smashing success.

196
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,120
I think it will be successful.

197
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Yeah, absolutely.

198
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,880
Looking at the specs of it and what it can actually do, it's a completely managed database

199
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,320
solution, which takes a lot of the work and effort out for you, and it's got all the backups

200
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
sorted out.

201
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,000
It's distributed over different data centers.

202
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's lightning fast.

203
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,040
I can see people moving away from MongoDB to this in their droves.

204
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,040
Yeah, and as the famous saying goes, nobody gets fired for choosing AWS.

205
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:56,560
Now, it's worth pointing out, MongoDB does have their own managed database as a service,

206
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,640
but it launched in 2017, and in their most recent results, Mongo said they had about

207
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,320
6,200 customers using the service.

208
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
That's not going to compete with AWS.

209
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,760
There's probably more than that already on AWS.

210
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,040
Yeah, they probably had more beta testers than that.

211
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,240
But it is yet more vendor lock-in, isn't it?

212
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,380
That's where I would be concerned to use this.

213
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,660
I think a lot of companies won't care about that because they are just totally wedded

214
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,660
to AWS.

215
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:30,200
But at least if you were using MongoDB on AWS, you can extract your data and run it

216
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,160
on premises, whereas once it's locked into this, it's going to be that bit harder to

217
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
do so.

218
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,600
They also, to make things easier for you to get in and get all that nice lock-in, they're

219
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,320
introducing a MongoDB compatibility layer, which is essentially compliant with MongoDB

220
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,960
3.6's API.

221
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,640
Before they changed their license, which we covered a few weeks ago, just like we predicted

222
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,200
in that episode, Amazon froze that code base, they forked right there and said, here's your

223
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
compatibility layer.

224
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,480
We'll implement our own database, but we will support MongoDB 3.6's API.

225
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
Savage.

226
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,480
There's a bit of a war of words as well, isn't there, between Amazon and MongoDB?

227
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,200
MongoDB are saying that, oh, it's a poor man's MongoDB and it's a rip-off.

228
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,360
And Amazon are saying, well, this is a proper professional version of it that's actually

229
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
going to work properly.

230
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,520
Yeah, well really, I was reading a quote in the register from Amazon's non-relational

231
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,480
database VP, Sean Bice, and the register says he makes no bones about the fact that Amazon

232
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,420
spent a lot of time looking at how to support MongoDB workloads, thought about that a lot,

233
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,720
and then ultimately decided to build a new purpose-built document database from the ground

234
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,440
up, end quote, that supported the MongoDB APIs.

235
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,640
And then throughout the rest of the article, there's like little jibes at their availability

236
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,920
and their scalability and their regional limitations and things like that just kind of sprinkled

237
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,800
throughout the whole article.

238
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,220
Amazon clearly has a more competitive product built off the backs of years of developers

239
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,360
contributing to open source, and they're just like, all right, thanks for the fish.

240
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,440
So long.

241
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,280
This is very much aimed at enterprise, though.

242
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,080
I mean, you only have to look at the resources that they offer, starting from 15 gigabytes

243
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,080
of RAM up to nearly 500 gigabytes.

244
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,600
This is not your sort of $10 droplet situation, is it?

245
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
No.

246
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,240
I mean, cost is definitely going to be a consideration, which is maybe where the MongoDB service

247
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,000
can remain competitive.

248
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,040
This is really like all other AWS services.

249
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,040
It's pricing on demand.

250
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,080
And the one thing is they don't charge for the inbound, so getting data into your document

251
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,020
DB instance, they don't charge you for.

252
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,520
But there is an IO rate.

253
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,960
There's the storage rate.

254
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,560
There's a lot of cost in here, including backup.

255
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,000
And it's a cost that enterprises are willing to pay for to have really, really reliable

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
infrastructure.

257
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,520
But it's so cost prohibitive for some companies that they may start with other document databases

258
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,000
and just remain on them because of the initial startup cost.

259
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,440
But for the enterprises that can afford it, I think this is going to be very, very successful.

260
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,480
If you look at the companies that are already using Amazon document DB, like Capital One,

261
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,200
Dow Jones, and the Washington Post, as well as many others, this is going to be a massive

262
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
success.

263
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,600
I know I said that at the start of the story, but I really think Amazon's going to have

264
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,640
a win here.

265
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:24,240
And we really, as an open source community, need to take a hard look at this because this

266
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,400
is a product that is a rip off of something that open source developers have contributed

267
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
to for years.

268
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,800
I don't know.

269
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Maybe I'm wrong.

270
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Is this a rip off or not?

271
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
Let me know.

272
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
LinuxActionNews.com slash contact.

273
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,880
I'd really like to get the audience's take on that because to me it feels like Amazon's

274
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,500
playing a little dirty here.

275
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,960
But they're also a capitalist based company.

276
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,960
They're trying to be competitive.

277
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,920
I can't really argue with them wanting to make money and everything was free and open.

278
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,760
And so as long as they make that MongoDB compatibility API Apache licensed, they're good.

279
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:01,280
The back end implementation can be closed and owned by Amazon for eternity.

280
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,920
And the API layer that is MongoDB compatible can stay open source, everybody's happy.

281
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,640
Yeah, MongoDB have really shot themselves in the foot there, changing the license to

282
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,800
try and stop this sort of thing because it's happened anyway.

283
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,840
By everybody being happy, I mean MongoDB is not going to be happy.

284
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,800
And you wonder now, just speculation corner here on Linux Action News, which is something

285
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,480
we don't do very often, did they know at the time this was in the works?

286
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,360
Was that maybe part of the story that didn't come out at the time, is that they knew Amazon?

287
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,640
Because surely Amazon's been working on this for a while.

288
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,360
In some of the reports, they say three years.

289
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,120
Yeah, at least two I read.

290
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,640
So you would imagine that they got wind of it.

291
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,680
And maybe that did influence their decision.

292
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
Yeah, yeah.

293
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,680
I don't know.

294
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,680
It's hard to say.

295
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
They didn't say at the time.

296
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,120
So I get end speculation corner, but I thought that was interesting.

297
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Yeah.

298
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,680
Well, some good news coming out of the LVFS project this week is that Phoenix have joined

299
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,680
them.

300
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,200
Yes, the makers of really widely used firmwares.

301
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,400
They're a huge firmware vendor.

302
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,080
Anybody using a ThinkPad right now?

303
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,480
They're probably using Phoenix code in the main board.

304
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:11,160
They've been working with Lenovo, Phoenix has, and their ODMs on LVS support for a while.

305
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:17,640
This was kind of hinted when Richard, the main guy behind the LVS project, announced

306
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,180
Lenovo was on board.

307
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,760
There was an implication, kind of like a little sneaky message in there, that there was another

308
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,720
big vendor about to be announced.

309
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
This is it.

310
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,920
This is a big deal because Richard hopes that, big picture, other downstream vendors like

311
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:37,080
Tuxedo and Star Labs will be able to take advantage of LVFS without having to work back

312
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:41,000
and forth with their upstream ODMs like Clevo.

313
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,440
Interesting though that System76 and Intraware are not in that list.

314
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,880
Yeah, there's been a little bit of back and forth.

315
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:52,680
I'm not going to say beef, but getting on for beef between Huzy and those companies

316
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
you mentioned.

317
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,880
It's not a huge surprise that he didn't link to them.

318
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,920
But hopefully they'll be able to take advantage of this.

319
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,560
Getting that firmware update through your software manager really feels like a first

320
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,640
class desktop Linux experience, so I hope so too.

321
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,400
And the more of these companies who get on board, the more momentum there is and hopefully

322
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,840
that will mean that eventually we'll have all of the hardware companies on board and

323
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,680
we'll just be able to update firmware for every device that we've got.

324
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,280
That would be nice.

325
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,960
Even if it is proprietary software, at least if you're getting updates, it's better than

326
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,960
not.

327
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
This is how I felt for a while.

328
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,240
If we're going to turn all of these chips into mini computers running operating systems

329
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,760
and firmware, then we better keep them secure and up to date.

330
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,000
It's a responsibility we have as end users and the companies making this stuff and this

331
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
enables that.

332
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,720
So it's a pretty big deal and I love to just see every few weeks Richard has another post

333
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,920
about another win for that project.

334
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,920
It's so great to see that and every time the story comes up after the announcement of IBM

335
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,220
buying Red Hat, I think to myself in the back of my mind, yep, this is another one of those

336
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,240
Red Hat projects that we really don't want to go away.

337
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,040
I really want this to stick around.

338
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Just keeping tally.

339
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Not that I'm worried.

340
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
No, I'm not worried.

341
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
No, no.

342
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
It could go wrong, right?

343
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,360
Although if I was an Ethereum Classic user, I would be very worried this last week.

344
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,480
The Ethereum Classic network suffered one of those famous 51% attacks.

345
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,600
Yeah, it's not clear if that's exactly what it was, but it was something akin to a 51%

346
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
attack.

347
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:30,280
It was a lot of transactions that were double spent basically, which meant that whoever

348
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:36,120
was doing this attack made off with the best part of half a million dollars worth of Ethereum

349
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,120
Classic.

350
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,240
Yeah, so this is also called a rollback attack and a rollback attack generates a new fork

351
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,040
of the blockchain essentially.

352
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,960
This causes nodes to replace the original blockchain, the one that was supposed to be

353
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,160
the agreed upon blockchain, with the new one that makes it possible for attackers to reverse

354
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,720
previously made transactions.

355
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,860
So you could reverse transactions to go in their favor.

356
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,460
They're essentially getting the majority of the network to adopt a new ledger and they

357
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,720
have retroactively tilted that register in their favor, like an accounting register.

358
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,380
Rollback attacks require control of a substantial fraction of the total horsepower though.

359
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,540
So it really takes some machinery devoted to generating the blockchain to get that power,

360
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,000
to have that level of consensus.

361
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,620
And to the network's credit, a lot of people noticed this was going on pretty quickly,

362
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,620
one of them being Coinbase.

363
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,580
Yeah, and they suspended trading on it very, very quickly.

364
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,880
But it's funny that we're talking about Ethereum Classic here rather than Ethereum because

365
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:35,000
Ethereum Classic was created out of controversy in the first place because there was a huge

366
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,980
theft of Ethereum and at the time there was a lot of debate within the community, should

367
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,980
we fork the blockchain and basically give everyone their money back or should we not?

368
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,840
And it was decided that they would fork that blockchain, give everyone their money back

369
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,420
and that was Ethereum.

370
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:57,100
And the kind of diehard purists who said, no, that's not right, you just have to roll

371
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,060
with it, that carried on as Ethereum Classic.

372
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,600
I guess in theory, the smaller the network, the easier it would be to get a substantial

373
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,980
control of it if you have access to a lot of horsepower.

374
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,940
Yeah, and it seems that Ethereum Classic was just about the right size where it was worth

375
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,500
doing, but it was also possible to do because you couldn't really do that with Bitcoin,

376
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,700
for example, because it's just too many people mining it.

377
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,820
Although there really is a quick fix that exchanges and large pools can make to prevent

378
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,100
this is they can just increase the number of confirmation blocks, which takes longer

379
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,480
and then makes it much harder to have a majority control.

380
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,640
It still feels like we're in the early days of cryptocurrencies to me.

381
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,300
Some people would argue and say that it's all about to tank and by the end of this year

382
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,940
or maybe next year, it'll all be worth nothing and it'll just be proved to be a pyramid scheme.

383
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,520
But this feels like teething issues to me.

384
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:54,600
We need to work out this stuff before we can get to a point where it's actually used by

385
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
normal people.

386
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,540
And I know that people were kind of starting to get that way when Bitcoin got up to around

387
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,780
twenty thousand dollars.

388
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:08,500
But since that's kind of gone back down to various lows that I don't even want to think

389
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,180
about how low it is.

390
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:15,460
But since then, people have lost it, you know, normal people have lost interest.

391
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:21,380
But I think we need to go through these issues and work out ways to get around them if we're

392
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:26,860
ever going to get to a situation where cryptocurrencies are taken seriously and just part of everyday

393
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,500
life like using a visa card.

394
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
Right.

395
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,500
It's growing pains.

396
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:35,140
Not that you asked, but it's almost thirty five hundred dollars right now as we record.

397
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:41,180
I was looking I was trying to try to get some perspective on what does it take for a new

398
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,700
currency to be adopted?

399
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,740
Like what is just the the average time?

400
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,040
And I I didn't go back to gold and I didn't go very far.

401
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,180
But looking at countries that have made currency switches right now, it typically takes some

402
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,500
of these smaller countries about six months on average to like transition to the new currency.

403
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,700
Then the public takes about two years for the old currency to be worked out.

404
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,640
But cryptocurrency is a totally different piece.

405
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,980
Like these other these other currencies are backed by a government, by a central authority,

406
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,780
which makes implementation straightforward.

407
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,720
They tell you to use this currency and you have to use that currency to pay your taxes

408
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,620
like you've got no choice.

409
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,820
But with cryptocurrency, it's like Linux distros.

410
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,540
There's tons to pick from.

411
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,540
They're open source, they're organic, they go in different directions.

412
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
Sometimes they make mistakes.

413
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,260
It's a totally different beast than a government controlled currency.

414
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:33,540
And it may never work out, or it may take a generation to work out the kinks for the

415
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,540
people's currency.

416
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:39,720
Well, I remember reading quite a lot about this a year or so ago and coming to the conclusion

417
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,740
that we wouldn't have one cryptocurrency to rule them all, we'd end up with thousands

418
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:51,460
all kind of interacting with each other and having micropayments here and there.

419
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:56,080
So it just feels too early to know exactly where we're going to be, whether or not we're

420
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,540
going to end up with Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever becoming just the one that's used

421
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:07,420
or whether everyone will have their own currency and they'll just be traded, I suppose, like

422
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,260
the fiat currencies that we have now.

423
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,720
I think that's got to be what happens.

424
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,780
If cryptocurrency ever got legitimate, where it was maybe even a little sexy for a company

425
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,060
to use it, you can imagine the Amazon coin.

426
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:28,380
And your Xbox tokens and your Google Play Store currency could all be cryptocurrency

427
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,380
that the user isn't even aware of.

428
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,780
It's all white labeled and done with GUIs for the end user.

429
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,940
But on the back end, it's their own cryptocurrency that they could even play the markets with

430
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,780
and all kinds of really horrifying stuff.

431
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,820
But it just seems like naturally, that's the way it's going to go.

432
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,940
If anybody can make their own cryptocurrency, you just have to be big enough for adoption

433
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,720
for it to be successful.

434
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,980
And if they get legitimate, why wouldn't that happen?

435
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,700
It's going to become the internet funny money.

436
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,340
And in a way, it'll be good because in theory, consumers could trade between platforms.

437
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,380
If you have an Amazon coin and you no longer want to use Amazon Prime and you want to go

438
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:08,060
subscribe to Google YouTube Music, in theory, you would be able to transfer your crypto

439
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:12,980
Amazon coin over using an exchange into your Google account, perhaps.

440
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,820
Maybe that'd be the upside for consumers.

441
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:20,980
But it's going to be a weird, weird sort of dystopian sci-fi future when that happens.

442
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,700
Everybody will have their own internet tokens.

443
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,700
Yeah.

444
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,980
Or maybe it'll just crash and just keep using the dollar and the pound and the euro and

445
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,980
stuff.

446
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,980
Buy gold, Joe.

447
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,980
Yeah.

448
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,980
Could you imagine?

449
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,500
That'd be such a great native ad, like if we had gold ads on this show.

450
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:43,240
Well, either way, it turns out, we'll cover it here on the show, if it takes over the

451
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,680
world or it fizzles out, whenever it matters, we'll cover it on Linux Action News.
