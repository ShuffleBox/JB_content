00:00.000 --> 00:10.640
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, Episode 224, recorded on January 19th, 2022.

00:10.640 --> 00:11.640
I'm Chris.

00:11.640 --> 00:12.640
And I'm Wes.

00:12.640 --> 00:13.640
Hello, Wes.

00:13.640 --> 00:15.200
Let's do the news.

00:15.200 --> 00:20.200
And we start with what we might normally report as some good news.

00:20.200 --> 00:24.080
That's a surge of activity over at the LVFS project.

00:24.080 --> 00:29.600
Unfortunately, this boost in traffic appears to be due to vendors releasing some new firmware

00:29.600 --> 00:34.680
updates ahead of disclosing what might be some security fixes.

00:34.680 --> 00:38.280
Oh, yeah, Michael Larble over at Ferronix noticed this.

00:38.280 --> 00:42.400
And he put together with the fact that last summer, something like this kind of happened

00:42.400 --> 00:46.280
right before Dell had to push out a BIOS update.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.560
Also kind of giving us a hint that something might be going on.

00:48.560 --> 00:54.160
Richard Hughes, who runs the LVFS project, the lead developer, also tweeted that it's

00:54.160 --> 01:00.560
almost like a vendor is shipping updates like crazy for a high security upcoming issue,

01:00.560 --> 01:05.640
which I think is him basically saying that's exactly what's happening.

01:05.640 --> 01:07.880
Probably a good reminder to patch your hardware, though.

01:07.880 --> 01:08.940
Yeah, definitely.

01:08.940 --> 01:11.120
There is some good news, though, for the project.

01:11.120 --> 01:15.080
The FWAPD component, that's the part that runs on your computer and does the actual

01:15.080 --> 01:17.640
updates, saw a new version.

01:17.640 --> 01:26.200
Yes, FWAPD 174 adds firmware branch support for modem manager devices, improved patching,

01:26.200 --> 01:32.200
and a variety of bug fixes, and of course, support for some new hardware.

01:32.200 --> 01:38.480
Some hardware that I'm really happy to see in here, HP's USB-C G2 dock now supported

01:38.480 --> 01:46.080
by FWAPD, the ThinkPad Thunderbolt 4 dock now supported, also the QCEL LTE modem also

01:46.080 --> 01:47.080
on this list.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.200
So that's just some good stuff on here.

01:49.200 --> 01:54.160
It is supremely awesome to see these USB docks getting some support and that Thunderbolt

01:54.160 --> 02:00.920
dock because those have upped my work at home game to the next level and getting support

02:00.920 --> 02:03.800
right there in my Linux machine to update these.

02:03.800 --> 02:07.600
Well, I mean, that's actually going to just determine which ones I buy going forward.

02:07.600 --> 02:12.040
I think it was really nice to sort of be included in this round of hardware support.

02:12.040 --> 02:16.480
You know, like 10 years ago, I feel like we'd be lucky enough that these might work on Linux

02:16.480 --> 02:20.600
at all, let alone any hope of being able to update or work with their firmware.

02:20.600 --> 02:24.460
But with some of these docks, it feels like Linux really is a first-class citizen and

02:24.460 --> 02:27.560
updates like these are key to making that happen.

02:27.560 --> 02:31.840
Well, moving up the stack a bit, GNOME 42's Alpha is out.

02:31.840 --> 02:37.160
This is a big one because Libidwadia ships in this, and it's also a transition from my

02:37.160 --> 02:44.300
tried and my true love, gedit, to the new modern GNOME text editor that has been developed

02:44.300 --> 02:47.540
by the same developer who built GNOME Builder.

02:47.540 --> 02:49.240
So I have some high hopes for it.

02:49.240 --> 02:53.280
But there's also just a lot of technology under the hood, some transitions happening

02:53.280 --> 02:54.280
with this one.

02:54.280 --> 03:01.760
Yeah, Libidwadia is here, and GNOME 42 will be depending on it in more than a couple ways.

03:01.760 --> 03:05.400
Sure, apps and modules are migrating over there.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.320
That's going to continue the next few cycles, I expect.

03:08.320 --> 03:13.840
But this time around, the GNOME desktop module now works with GTK4, and the internals have

03:13.840 --> 03:15.760
been split out into three libraries.

03:15.760 --> 03:20.880
It might not sound like much, but I think this is the release you can tell that GNOME's

03:20.880 --> 03:25.160
getting serious about GTK4 and the next evolution of the desktop.

03:25.160 --> 03:30.880
Yeah, and you have to figure getting the GNOME desktop module itself to build against GTK4

03:30.880 --> 03:35.520
and all of the work that went into that was a huge amount of effort just for this release

03:35.520 --> 03:36.520
alone.

03:36.520 --> 03:42.600
This really does feel like the release where GTK4 is finally getting taken advantage of,

03:42.600 --> 03:46.080
and you're really seeing things make the transition.

03:46.080 --> 03:51.800
And with GTK4, you get a lot of niceties, some GPU acceleration, things look a little

03:51.800 --> 03:52.800
nicer.

03:52.800 --> 03:56.800
I mean, there's a lot happening here with this release simply because of the embracement

03:56.800 --> 03:57.800
of GTK4.

03:57.800 --> 04:02.920
Now, this is an alpha phase, so you kind of have to be a diehard to go try it at this

04:02.920 --> 04:04.240
point in time.

04:04.240 --> 04:08.800
But if you wait, there will be another release scheduled for mid-February, and then the final

04:08.800 --> 04:17.520
release of GNOME 42 Desktop Environment is expected on March 23, 2022.

04:17.520 --> 04:21.560
Well the cat is out of the bag, so to speak.

04:21.560 --> 04:27.440
SUSE formally announced today that they've got a new support offering targeted at mixed

04:27.440 --> 04:30.800
Linux environments within the enterprise.

04:30.800 --> 04:33.920
They've named it SUSE Liberty Linux.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.160
No, it's not a distro.

04:36.160 --> 04:43.800
It's a little bit more dialed back than that, but it is a mixed environment enterprise offering.

04:43.800 --> 04:49.560
So if you have some virtual machines that have SUSE and CentOS, as they put it, they

04:49.560 --> 04:54.160
would be happy to sell you a support package that helps cover all of them.

04:54.160 --> 04:59.480
They write in the announcement, SUSE Liberty Linux is a new technology and support offering

04:59.480 --> 05:04.240
that provides customers a unified support experience for managing their heterogeneous

05:04.240 --> 05:05.240
IT environments.

05:05.240 --> 05:11.920
With SUSE Liberty Linux, you get trusted support with optional proven management tools that

05:11.920 --> 05:18.200
are optimized for mixed Linux environments, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS,

05:18.200 --> 05:23.600
and as you would expect, OpenSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.

05:23.600 --> 05:28.280
Now I happened to go on the website to go buy it, but as of this recording, it was just

05:28.280 --> 05:31.720
announced today, you can actually buy it on their online store.

05:31.720 --> 05:35.360
So I guess you got to call in and talk to a salesperson.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.720
Something tells me you might not be doing that.

05:37.720 --> 05:43.800
Now we were going off of some repository statistics that showed us that at one point, there was

05:43.800 --> 05:48.160
a CentOS clone out there identifying itself as SUSE Liberty Server.

05:48.160 --> 05:55.620
And one has to wonder if at one point, SUSE Liberty Linux was going to also include a

05:55.620 --> 05:58.760
Linux distribution and not just a support service.

05:58.760 --> 06:04.120
It doesn't seem impossible, or did they just get a little overzealous in how they configured

06:04.120 --> 06:07.160
things with their new daemon on top?

06:07.160 --> 06:12.480
Perhaps the sales department said, excuse us, how are we going to sell SUSE Enterprise

06:12.480 --> 06:18.720
Server for $5,000 for a couple of VMs if you're giving away a CentOS clone?

06:18.720 --> 06:23.680
It's probably the same exact conversation the Red Hat sales team had when they decided

06:23.680 --> 06:25.720
they needed to change the way CentOS worked.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.680
I mean, let's be real here.

06:27.680 --> 06:32.160
They would have undermined their own sales with SUSE Liberty Linux.

06:32.160 --> 06:36.720
And so they still have a lot of the infrastructure in place because they have to build these

06:36.720 --> 06:37.720
patches.

06:37.720 --> 06:41.480
They have to pull down these source RPMs from Red Hat, and they have to rebuild them and

06:41.480 --> 06:43.040
put them in their pipeline.

06:43.040 --> 06:46.680
So they still need the majority of the tooling they would have needed for their own distribution,

06:46.680 --> 06:51.000
but they don't undermine their brand and their primary server distribution.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.160
Oh, count me still a little disappointed.

06:54.160 --> 06:56.240
It would have been a great laugh.

06:56.240 --> 07:01.000
Also speaking of things that have been in the works for a little while, Wine 7.0 released

07:01.000 --> 07:07.040
after a year's worth of developments and over 9,000 changes.

07:07.040 --> 07:12.700
There's a lot in here, but one major improvement we've all been waiting for for a long time.

07:12.700 --> 07:13.700
That's right.

07:13.700 --> 07:20.400
It's WOW64, also known as the 64-bit Windows on Windows architecture.

07:20.400 --> 07:26.600
And Wine now has an implementation that supports running a 32-bit Windows application inside

07:26.600 --> 07:30.120
a 64-bit Unix host process.

07:30.120 --> 07:36.480
WOW64 support has also been added to most Unix libraries with Wine 7.0, which means

07:36.480 --> 07:41.960
a 32-bit PE module can call back to a 64-bit Unix library.

07:41.960 --> 07:47.920
And then once the remaining modules are converted to the PE format, this should make it possible

07:47.920 --> 07:54.560
to run 32-bit applications without having to install 32-bit Unix libraries.

07:54.560 --> 07:56.720
That is really kind of a big deal.

07:56.720 --> 08:01.560
They've also updated the VKD 3D support in this.

08:01.560 --> 08:05.800
There's been support for multiple displays improved with a few caveats, we'll have a

08:05.800 --> 08:12.300
link in the show notes for, as well as some updates to various Direct3D 10 and 11 features.

08:12.300 --> 08:16.080
So this is a major one and it's out now and it's fresh.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.880
I guess fresh wine in this case is actually a good thing.

08:18.880 --> 08:23.040
That's right, we're even using it to record this very episode.

08:23.040 --> 08:29.640
Yeah fair enough, a few of our favorite plugins run in our favorite editor using Wine.

08:29.640 --> 08:35.000
And like a dope, I decided to upgrade right before the show and it worked out just fine.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.480
Of course it did, come on, you didn't have faith.

08:37.480 --> 08:41.400
I must have, I mean I hit yes to the upgrade.

08:41.400 --> 08:46.800
You know, all joking aside, this is a really impressive release and besides the specifics

08:46.800 --> 08:53.200
of that WoW 64 support, there's just been a ton of work to get all of these wine libraries

08:53.200 --> 08:56.000
working and building in the PE format.

08:56.000 --> 08:59.440
I think at first I didn't fully appreciate exactly why switching the format that, you

08:59.440 --> 09:02.880
know, just the format of the libraries, there's details around that but it's not like everything's

09:02.880 --> 09:05.000
getting rewritten here.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.160
But I think that WoW 64 architecture support, some of these improvements packaged up in

09:09.160 --> 09:14.720
7 are showing that all that work is having some pretty neat downstream effects that we're

09:14.720 --> 09:16.680
already seeing the benefit of.

09:16.680 --> 09:22.680
Okay, while we're kind of talking about graphics, I think it's probably worth mentioning that

09:22.680 --> 09:27.560
a former Intel driver that was responsible for the Vulkan driver over there left a little

09:27.560 --> 09:32.880
while ago and now it appears that they're maybe you could say at Greener Pastures.

09:32.880 --> 09:37.880
We're talking about Jason Ekstrand who up until recently has been the lead developer

09:37.880 --> 09:43.720
of Intel's open source ANV Vulkan Linux driver.

09:43.720 --> 09:49.520
Now Jason left Intel back in December but just recently revealed some new details about

09:49.520 --> 09:51.920
where he'll be working next.

09:51.920 --> 09:57.120
Over the years working at Intel, Jason managed to become one of the top five contributors

09:57.120 --> 10:01.800
to Mesa, even though he's really only been working on the Linux graphics stack since

10:01.800 --> 10:04.360
around 2013.

10:04.360 --> 10:09.720
That meant that when he announced he was leaving Intel and hadn't announced where he was going,

10:09.720 --> 10:14.600
some were a bit concerned because, I mean, he contributes a lot to the stuff we all take

10:14.600 --> 10:16.400
for granted on our desktop.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.400
We held our breath.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.240
We're like, okay, let's watch.

10:19.240 --> 10:24.920
And now we know Jason took to his blog and he wrote that in my new role at Collabra,

10:24.920 --> 10:31.640
my mandate consists of two things, invest and mentor the Collabra 3D graphics team and

10:31.640 --> 10:36.160
invest in upstream Linux in the open source graphic driver, however I see fit.

10:36.160 --> 10:41.680
Yeah, he doubled down on that saying, as far as I'm concerned, when it comes to how I spend

10:41.680 --> 10:46.880
my engineering effort, I now report directly to upstream.

10:46.880 --> 10:50.840
That's exciting for a few reasons, some of which he mentions further on his blog, but

10:50.840 --> 10:56.600
things like not being tied to any driver or particular hardware vendor.

10:56.600 --> 11:00.400
Jason also seemed to be looking forward to be able to help out his new coworker, Alyssa

11:00.400 --> 11:07.280
Rosenzweig, who you might know for her work on Asahi Linux and the GPU support over there.

11:07.280 --> 11:12.720
It's also just fascinating to watch the continued developments over at Collabra and the sort

11:12.720 --> 11:17.800
of unique arrangement here where Jason won't be expected to do any contract work.

11:17.800 --> 11:22.780
I mean, sure, he's obviously helping and training the folks at Collabra, but it's clear they

11:22.780 --> 11:29.920
understand that investing in the ecosystem really benefits them as well.

11:29.920 --> 11:44.280
Linode has some really great offerings.

11:44.280 --> 11:47.760
First of all, they have 11 data centers around the world for you to choose from.

11:47.760 --> 11:54.280
They're 30 to 50% less than the big hyperscalers out there, and those big hyperscaler vendors,

11:54.280 --> 11:56.080
they're really going to try to pitch you.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.760
They'll sell themselves as a one-stop shop.

11:58.760 --> 12:04.200
All you need is offered here, they'll tell you, but really that's vendor lock-in, and

12:04.200 --> 12:08.720
you'll get so deeply entwined into that vendor's ecosystem that it becomes nearly impossible

12:08.720 --> 12:12.320
or at least cost prohibitive to get out.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.640
Linode can be part of a multi-cloud strategy.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.500
Go try it out with that $100 and try it.

12:17.500 --> 12:20.300
Everybody's talking about multi-cloud these days.

12:20.300 --> 12:21.300
There's a reason for it.

12:21.300 --> 12:24.480
And when you look at the pricing of Linode, you look at what they offer and their services

12:24.480 --> 12:29.160
like their S3-compatible object storage, or their Kubernetes management.

12:29.160 --> 12:33.000
So if you've already got some infrastructure management in place, Linode can work with

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
that.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.640
They got VLAN support, DDoS protection, cloud firewalls, and bare metal servers rolling

12:37.640 --> 12:39.080
out as well.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.380
And I think one of my favorite things is just the speed.

12:41.380 --> 12:44.540
They have very fast CPUs, they've got MVME storage.

12:44.540 --> 12:49.700
It's such a great service, backed by the best customer support in the business.

12:49.700 --> 12:52.240
So go try them out and support the show.

12:52.240 --> 12:57.100
It's a great way to keep Linux action news going every single week.

12:57.100 --> 13:00.860
Try something out and learn something yourself and support a company that's been pretty great

13:00.860 --> 13:06.640
to the community, linode.com slash lan.

13:06.640 --> 13:11.060
And a tremendous thank you to Ting, linux.ting.com.

13:11.060 --> 13:14.320
If you're sick of overpaying for your cell service and you're ready to save some money,

13:14.320 --> 13:20.200
go to linux.ting.com and then take 25 bucks off of that, linux.ting.com.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.720
Ting is a mobile virtual network operator.

13:22.720 --> 13:26.640
That means that Ting customers get access to the big carrier networks, but with way

13:26.640 --> 13:30.040
better customer service and at a lower cost.

13:30.040 --> 13:32.880
Ting manages multiple networks.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.720
So when you go to their website, they can determine the best coverage in your area and

13:36.720 --> 13:39.560
within minutes you'll be set and they'll be sending you a SIM card.

13:39.560 --> 13:43.220
And you know, Ting Mobile was recently named the number one carrier by Consumer Reports

13:43.220 --> 13:44.620
in 2021.

13:44.620 --> 13:46.100
How fantastic is that?

13:46.100 --> 13:48.880
And that's not the first time Ting has won accolades like that.

13:48.880 --> 13:54.400
That's a reason why, and many more, why I've been a customer since 2000 and frickin' 13.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.520
Ting Mobile is just simply smarter.

13:56.520 --> 14:01.480
They've got great flexible plans, plans with unlimited talk and unlimited text, and every

14:01.480 --> 14:07.940
plan gets access to Ting's award-winning customer service with nationwide LTE and 5G coverage.

14:07.940 --> 14:09.500
And the best part?

14:09.500 --> 14:10.960
No contracts ever.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.800
It's super simple to switch to Ting, so just go try it out.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.960
Pretty much any phone will work because they got multiple networks they support.

14:16.960 --> 14:20.840
Linux.ting.com, check your current phone, you create an account, you pick the plan that's

14:20.840 --> 14:22.200
right for you.

14:22.200 --> 14:25.880
Ting's gonna send you a SIM card, you're gonna pop that in, you're gonna get activated in

14:25.880 --> 14:28.680
minutes, and you're saving money.

14:28.680 --> 14:29.680
It's that easy.

14:29.680 --> 14:34.700
Cutting your phone bill in half has never been easier with Ting's great new plans.

14:34.700 --> 14:40.920
Check them out, Linux.ting.com.

14:40.920 --> 14:41.920
Watch out!

14:41.920 --> 14:47.000
Last week, we learned about an interesting and perhaps dangerous new vulnerability in

14:47.000 --> 14:49.280
our dear Linux kernel.

14:49.280 --> 14:55.400
It's a heap-based buffer overflow flaw that was found in the file system context functionality,

14:55.400 --> 15:00.160
specifically how one of its legacy functions verified the length of one of its supplied

15:00.160 --> 15:02.040
parameters.

15:02.040 --> 15:08.080
This ultimately means that, with the right exploit, an unprivileged local user was able

15:08.080 --> 15:12.720
to open a file system that didn't support the fancy new file system context API and

15:12.720 --> 15:17.880
thus needed to use the legacy stuff could escalate their privileges to root.

15:17.880 --> 15:25.320
Sadly, this bug was introduced way back in 5.1rc1 and is present in all Linux kernel

15:25.320 --> 15:27.280
releases since.

15:27.280 --> 15:33.520
That means all supported releases of Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4 GA and onwards.

15:33.520 --> 15:38.600
Yeah, 5.1's been around for a while, so get to patching, everybody.

15:38.600 --> 15:43.160
And while we're kind of talking about kernel stuff here, we now have learned that Ubuntu

15:43.160 --> 15:50.080
2204, that's the next LTS that comes out in April, it will ship with Linux 5.15.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.160
Now that makes sense.

15:52.160 --> 15:57.320
Linux 5.15 is a long-term support kernel, so you'd probably want that in your long-term

15:57.320 --> 15:59.060
support distro.

15:59.060 --> 16:02.520
But it is a little unfortunate as far as timing goes.

16:02.520 --> 16:09.120
You see, Linux 5.16 came out last week, and by the time 2204 ships, well, yes, even Linux

16:09.120 --> 16:10.960
5.17 will be out.

16:10.960 --> 16:15.840
And unfortunately, even in just 5.16, there's some major nice-to-haves that would be great

16:15.840 --> 16:18.360
in a distribution that's going to be around for a while.

16:18.360 --> 16:23.300
Like for example, in Linux 5.16, we get Alder Lake S Graphics enabled.

16:23.300 --> 16:29.480
We also get the much talked about Futex system call support that'll be necessary for future

16:29.480 --> 16:31.720
Wine and Steam Play gaming.

16:31.720 --> 16:36.440
Also those IO optimizations we talked about on the show before, yep, those are also in

16:36.440 --> 16:37.440
5.16.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.440
I know.

16:38.440 --> 16:45.160
And then this one, Wes, this one stings a lot, AMD Ryzen 6000 mobile support.

16:45.160 --> 16:46.160
That would have been nice.

16:46.160 --> 16:51.800
Yeah, now there are PPAs available that you can get from Canonical to install a newer

16:51.800 --> 16:55.160
kernel on an older version of Ubuntu.

16:55.160 --> 17:01.000
But I don't think this has satisfied consumers.

17:01.000 --> 17:06.440
We are seeing a drainage of Ubuntu users in the Steam stats.

17:06.440 --> 17:12.200
Yeah, I mean, Ubuntu used to be kind of dominant, right?

17:12.200 --> 17:13.200
The king.

17:13.200 --> 17:18.160
That's the default go-to distro for so many people for so long now.

17:18.160 --> 17:23.320
I mean, you might recall the original Steam runtime was based on an old version of Ubuntu.

17:23.320 --> 17:29.640
So if you wanted the ideal Steam gaming setup, you used Ubuntu.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.240
That's just not the case anymore.

17:31.240 --> 17:34.560
No, it seems it's an Arch world now.

17:34.560 --> 17:41.160
I mean, if you take a look at some of the ProtonDB stats as Boiling Steam has done,

17:41.160 --> 17:47.400
you'll see that Arch Linux has gained progressively and seems to now be at a solid 20% for the

17:47.400 --> 17:48.640
last few months.

17:48.640 --> 17:55.420
Yeah, and Manjaro itself is almost as large as regular Arch, but Garuda is in those stats

17:55.420 --> 18:00.040
and DevROS is in there, and a lot of it seems at the expense of Ubuntu.

18:00.040 --> 18:05.760
Yeah, I mean, that adds up to basically half of the gamers on ProtonDB using some kind

18:05.760 --> 18:06.760
of Arch.

18:06.760 --> 18:10.600
Yeah, and that's just like an undeniable number.

18:10.600 --> 18:11.920
You can't ignore it.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.960
And there is room for non-Arch distros.

18:13.960 --> 18:16.300
PopOS has done pretty well in there.

18:16.300 --> 18:20.840
So it really seems to be answering the needs of that particular niche.

18:20.840 --> 18:23.480
I mean, I was trying to think about this.

18:23.480 --> 18:25.100
What is it about Linux gamers?

18:25.100 --> 18:26.880
What's driving them to use Arch?

18:26.880 --> 18:28.760
It's got to be software, right?

18:28.760 --> 18:30.640
It's got to be fresh software.

18:30.640 --> 18:35.040
You may have a little more willingness to engage with getting things right, putting

18:35.040 --> 18:38.540
in some effort to make your gameplay the best that it can be.

18:38.540 --> 18:44.000
So you might be willing to tinker a bit more than the average Linux user, but you're right.

18:44.000 --> 18:48.820
I mean, that's what's appealing about Arch is you've got the latest and greatest stuff.

18:48.820 --> 18:52.320
You basically have no hurdles in your way to customizing the system to try to eke out

18:52.320 --> 18:54.760
as much performance as possible.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.720
And the Arch wiki has a lot of great tips for helping you do so.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.720
Yeah.

18:58.720 --> 19:03.720
And when you have Manjaro and Garuda and Endeavor that are doing some of the heavy lifting for

19:03.720 --> 19:09.920
you, it makes getting access to a distro that gives you the freshest drivers and not just

19:09.920 --> 19:13.480
the ones that are in the kernel, but Nvidia drivers and things like that.

19:13.480 --> 19:18.180
And it gives you ways to like, one of the things that's really nice on Arch is you could

19:18.180 --> 19:23.400
easily have a launcher that chooses between the Steam runtime or the native libraries

19:23.400 --> 19:24.400
on your system.

19:24.400 --> 19:28.040
And they've just done a lot of that kind of stuff.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.840
But actually, I think it's bigger than that, Wes.

19:29.840 --> 19:35.400
I mean, I think definitely with gamers, there's a serious use case for newer software.

19:35.400 --> 19:41.240
But I myself have chose Fedora because of their kernel update policy.

19:41.240 --> 19:45.000
At least one of the reasons is because of Fedora's kernel update policy.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.360
And I like Tumbleweed because I get a fresh kernel.

19:48.360 --> 19:55.440
And so I wonder for you, where you kind of use your workstation in probably more of a

19:55.440 --> 20:00.560
development workstation mode than like pushing the hardware, do you find that you're drawn

20:00.560 --> 20:02.680
to a distribution with newer kernels?

20:02.680 --> 20:06.920
Or are you fine on a system that uses a kernel from a few years ago?

20:06.920 --> 20:09.040
Because everything you've got on that box is supported.

20:09.040 --> 20:11.000
See, it's tough.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.840
Okay, there's the hat that I have on where I'm the enthusiast.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.520
And yeah, I want the latest kernel.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.800
I want to try some of the features.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.280
Plus, I mean, we talk about them on the show.

20:19.280 --> 20:24.000
So I know all the neat stuff that they have, and then I just feel like I'm missing out.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
Colonel FOMO.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.000
Yeah, exactly.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.320
It's real.

20:28.320 --> 20:31.000
But on the other hand, yeah, I think a few releases behind.

20:31.000 --> 20:36.240
So you know, if I was running 5.15 and 5.17 out, and aside from the gaming stuff, I don't

20:36.240 --> 20:37.440
think I'd notice.

20:37.440 --> 20:40.440
But you go much longer than that.

20:40.440 --> 20:44.400
And yeah, I think I do, especially when, you know, when some of the container technology

20:44.400 --> 20:48.400
underneath changes, when there's changes to maybe the stuff you can do with firewalls,

20:48.400 --> 20:53.120
when there are major performance changes or new file system features or improvements.

20:53.120 --> 20:55.000
I think that stuff does matter.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.760
And it's nice to have easy access to it.

20:57.760 --> 20:58.760
I agree with you.

20:58.760 --> 21:04.100
Like the sweet spot for me is one or two releases behind is okay.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.680
Three releases, I start to notice it.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.420
Four releases, and I'm like, what is this?

21:08.420 --> 21:09.420
Some old system?

21:09.420 --> 21:10.420
This is ridiculous.

21:10.420 --> 21:12.220
Is this Slackware?

21:12.220 --> 21:16.760
And I just, I guess I just want, I want that stuff in my workstation OS.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.760
I don't necessarily need that in my server OS as much.

21:19.760 --> 21:24.920
And the LTS versions of Ubuntu are used as a server distribution.

21:24.920 --> 21:29.460
It's such a wider deployment scale than they are as a gaming system.

21:29.460 --> 21:34.360
So it is an absolutely reasonable choice for Canonical to make.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.360
Yes, definitely.

21:35.360 --> 21:40.840
And yeah, I can't help but be slightly disappointed because as an enthusiast, I'm not likely going

21:40.840 --> 21:43.060
to want to deploy it.

21:43.060 --> 21:46.480
And I have just recently deployed an Ubuntu server.

21:46.480 --> 21:50.160
And once I got it set up, then I removed a couple of the snaps that I accidentally installed

21:50.160 --> 21:52.480
by default.

21:52.480 --> 21:55.680
It's a pleasant experience, and it is reliable as heck.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.320
It just sits there and runs.

21:57.320 --> 21:58.680
It's a great little system.

21:58.680 --> 22:04.360
I think maybe in some case, the stability, the success of the Ubuntu LTS is maybe backfiring

22:04.360 --> 22:05.360
a bit here.

22:05.360 --> 22:09.640
Like, some of this is ameliorated if you run the Ubuntu point releases, you know, you kind

22:09.640 --> 22:14.720
of do the interim releases, but I mean, you talk to them, folks at Canonical even sometimes,

22:14.720 --> 22:16.180
those are just not what people are running.

22:16.180 --> 22:18.140
That's not really the focus.

22:18.140 --> 22:22.600
And even I think sometimes enthusiasts just kind of forget they exist.

22:22.600 --> 22:28.400
You know, after a while, an LTS in its lifecycle starts to just feel like Debian.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.400
That's really what it is.

22:29.400 --> 22:33.320
Like, okay, this is pretty much what current Debian is at this point.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.800
Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's not exactly shiny.

22:36.800 --> 22:37.800
Yeah.

22:37.800 --> 22:41.320
It does seem like when you look at the stats, which we will have linked in the show notes,

22:41.320 --> 22:45.760
that there's definitely a user base out there that might be choosing their distro just simply

22:45.760 --> 22:50.320
because they want the latest kernel, which is wild, but it seems to be happening.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.520
Speaking of wild, we do this show every single week.
