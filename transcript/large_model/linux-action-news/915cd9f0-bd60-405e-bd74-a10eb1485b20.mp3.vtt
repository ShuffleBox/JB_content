Hello and welcome to Linux Action News, our weekly take on Linux and the open source world.

00:16.100 --> 00:19.620
This is episode 5 recorded on June 11th, 2017.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.620
I'm Chris.

00:20.620 --> 00:21.620
And I'm Joe.

00:21.620 --> 00:27.260
Hello Joe, happy episode 5 to you and tip of the hat, this isn't the biggest, most active

00:27.260 --> 00:32.280
news week we have had since we started the show, but you still managed to dig a few nuggets

00:32.280 --> 00:34.160
out of the ground and we have some good stories.

00:34.160 --> 00:35.920
Should we kick it off with some Ubuntu news?

00:35.920 --> 00:38.780
Yeah, pretty Ubuntu heavy to start with.

00:38.780 --> 00:41.920
First of all, they are transitioning to Gnome Shell.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.160
Well, that's not news, but they've actually started now.

00:44.160 --> 00:50.880
The daily images have got rid of Unity and are using Gnome 3, Gnome Shell.

00:50.880 --> 00:54.600
But the slight difference is they've actually got buttons on the left still.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.040
Oh my gosh, that's what you go for.

00:57.040 --> 01:01.280
And immediately, oh, of course, of course they would probably cite continuity.

01:01.280 --> 01:04.840
It is a little newsworthy because we all thought this would be landing in the LTS.

01:04.840 --> 01:08.440
I know it's been announced since, but it's just a reminder that 1710 is going to be the

01:08.440 --> 01:10.120
switch over to Gnome 3.

01:10.120 --> 01:13.960
So they got the buttons on the left, but they've also made a decision, not that one, but they've

01:13.960 --> 01:16.240
made a decision that I'm really happy about.

01:16.240 --> 01:20.080
They're going to switch from LightDM to GDM, which has worked better for me on my Gnome

01:20.080 --> 01:21.080
setups too.

01:21.080 --> 01:24.800
Yeah, I suppose it makes sense really, they wanted to just simplify things, didn't they?

01:24.800 --> 01:28.400
Yeah, and I think it also came down to something about their guest session support.

01:28.400 --> 01:33.160
It would have just taken a pretty big amount of work to add the support to LightDM, and

01:33.160 --> 01:37.120
it takes a less amount of work to get it working in GDM.

01:37.120 --> 01:41.720
And they might not have it in 1710, but they'll have the guest sessions back by 1804, they

01:41.720 --> 01:42.720
suspect.

01:42.720 --> 01:47.800
Yeah, and I mentioned the buttons kind of half-jokingly, but I think that it does show

01:47.800 --> 01:52.440
that they're already thinking about putting their personal stamp on it.

01:52.440 --> 01:54.600
They don't want it to be just totally stock.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.600
I think you're probably right.

01:55.600 --> 01:59.400
The feelers they've been putting out on the surveys on OMG Ubuntu kind of indicate their

01:59.400 --> 02:00.400
intention too.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.640
Here's something I take as a good sign out of all of this, though.

02:02.640 --> 02:07.680
Canonical is playing host to a fractional scaling hackfest for Gnome in its Taipei offices

02:07.680 --> 02:08.680
this week.

02:08.680 --> 02:12.840
Gnome developers and Ubuntu developers are in attendance, and they've scrounged together

02:12.840 --> 02:17.080
the high DPI monitors from all around the office to plug into their Gnome machines,

02:17.080 --> 02:21.280
and this is real good, like, actual adult scaling.

02:21.280 --> 02:26.360
What we have right now in Gnome is either double scaling or no scaling.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.360
It's baby scaling.

02:27.360 --> 02:28.520
It's first-step scaling.

02:28.520 --> 02:29.520
It's adorable scaling.

02:29.520 --> 02:30.520
It gets you there.

02:30.520 --> 02:33.440
But this is grown-up adult scaling, where you can actually fractionally scale it up

02:33.440 --> 02:34.440
and down.

02:34.440 --> 02:39.200
Yeah, now, I can't afford a 4K monitor, so high DPI is just a distant dream for me.

02:39.200 --> 02:45.240
But having spoken to Aiki quite a lot about it, he said that Unity was the best experience

02:45.240 --> 02:49.720
that he'd had, and so it's good to see that we're not just going to lose that because

02:49.720 --> 02:55.160
the Ubuntu team are actually going to plow that knowledge and experience into Gnome and

02:55.160 --> 02:59.760
try and improve it, which it kind of goes against a little bit against what I had originally

02:59.760 --> 03:04.400
said that they wanted to just offload the development totally to the Gnome team and

03:04.400 --> 03:06.280
just offload the desktop.

03:06.280 --> 03:11.440
But it shows that they are still investing in it, and that's what people had hoped, that

03:11.440 --> 03:13.440
they would invest in the desktop.

03:13.440 --> 03:18.040
They're adding a lot of the Unity-type features that people really required to Gnome 3.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.880
Yeah, and hopefully it'll be better as a result of it.

03:20.880 --> 03:25.040
Also they're testing X Wayland compatibility, which seems like a pretty good thing.

03:25.040 --> 03:26.040
Looking forward.

03:26.040 --> 03:32.240
Yeah, because Wayland, although it's getting there, and if you look at Fedora using it

03:32.240 --> 03:37.400
as default, it seems to be working well for most people, but I do see on Google+, some

03:37.400 --> 03:40.320
people having issues with it still.

03:40.320 --> 03:46.600
So I don't think you can fully expect Wayland to just work completely.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.640
So yeah, I think it is something that they're going to need to work on.

03:49.640 --> 03:52.840
I mean, that was, funnily enough, the thing that always held MIR up, wasn't it?

03:52.840 --> 03:59.120
The XMIR support, because they knew that they would have to have four people to actually

03:59.120 --> 04:06.180
use the thing, and that's what made it never quite reach stable status and default.

04:06.180 --> 04:09.820
By the way, if you're grabbing the daily ISOs right now, you'll find that Unity 7 is no

04:09.820 --> 04:10.820
longer default.

04:10.820 --> 04:13.320
It's not even offered as an option from the login manager.

04:13.320 --> 04:18.420
However, if you're doing an upgrade, the packages are still in the repo.

04:18.420 --> 04:23.800
So you'll still have Unity 7, and they are available from the universe archive, if things

04:23.800 --> 04:25.200
don't go smoothly for you.

04:25.200 --> 04:29.900
Do you think that's an indication that it's not going to be there?

04:29.900 --> 04:33.880
Because there was a little bit of confusion as to exactly what was going to happen with

04:33.880 --> 04:34.880
it.

04:34.880 --> 04:37.800
They'd said that it would be there for people upgrading, but I mean, does this mean that

04:37.800 --> 04:41.360
it's just definitely not going to be an option for people installing it new?

04:41.360 --> 04:42.360
Possibly, yeah.

04:42.360 --> 04:43.360
Yeah, I think so.

04:43.360 --> 04:47.040
I mean, it's going to be in the universe, so there'll probably be a meta package that

04:47.040 --> 04:50.120
you could install to bring it down.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.600
But otherwise, they're just moving on.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.200
Yeah, I think that's probably true.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.600
And maybe others want to move on to something like Lubuntu.

04:55.600 --> 05:03.600
Yeah, so it turns out Lubuntu 17.10 will probably ship two different spins or versions.

05:03.600 --> 05:10.280
One LXDE, which is nothing new, hasn't changed for a long time, and the other LXCute.

05:10.280 --> 05:14.200
Now, that's the one I've been following with a little more interest, just because it's

05:14.200 --> 05:18.280
newer, a little more newsworthy, and also I'm a big fan of Qt.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.600
Yeah, you know, I'm not a huge fan of Qt.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.600
What?

05:21.600 --> 05:22.600
What?

05:22.600 --> 05:23.600
What?

05:23.600 --> 05:24.600
How do you just...

05:24.600 --> 05:25.600
What?

05:25.600 --> 05:26.600
Well, I just...

05:26.600 --> 05:29.720
There's something about the way it looks by default that I just don't like, and I prefer

05:29.720 --> 05:30.720
GTK.

05:30.720 --> 05:35.560
But at the same time, I can see the way GTK is going and how much churn there is there

05:35.560 --> 05:40.440
and how difficult it is to follow the development of it.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.700
I think you would be surprised, too.

05:41.700 --> 05:46.120
There's some Qt apps that are Qt and you don't realize it, the way they look.

05:46.120 --> 05:51.320
Well, yeah, VLC is a prime example that you wouldn't necessarily notice that.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.840
But I am following the LXCute development.

05:53.840 --> 05:55.400
I have been on and off.

05:55.400 --> 05:57.600
It's been a little while.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.800
And when I heard about this, I thought, well, I'll have a look at the daily...

06:00.800 --> 06:05.540
I saw it, Lubuntu Next, they're calling it, which is kind of like the Ubuntu Next used

06:05.540 --> 06:10.840
to be with the mere, by default, Unity 8.

06:10.840 --> 06:15.160
And I spent it up live thinking, I'll just have a quick look at it.

06:15.160 --> 06:19.960
This is on my test laptop that's got quite a few different partitions on it.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.600
And I think that what I'm about to say speaks volumes.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.280
I installed it.

06:26.280 --> 06:30.920
I want to see more about this, I want to check it out more.

06:30.920 --> 06:34.440
And you, as a devout ex-FCE user, were drawn to this.

06:34.440 --> 06:35.440
Yeah.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.000
I mean, hey, this is really quite good and quite promising.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.280
I mean, it's buggy.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.520
It's nowhere near a daily driver.

06:40.520 --> 06:42.240
I mean, it's a daily ISO.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.240
It's not supposed to be.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.560
It's not even alpha yet.

06:45.560 --> 06:52.920
So you're not going to rely on it yet, but to check it out and to see how it's working.

06:52.920 --> 06:53.920
Right.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.040
And it's a good time to give feedback there.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.180
They're specifically looking for feedback on their new default applications, like they've

06:59.180 --> 07:02.400
switched over to GNOME MPV as a default media player.

07:02.400 --> 07:06.920
They've also changed around some of the network management stack, so we might want to help

07:06.920 --> 07:08.280
them test that and give them feedback.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.280
Now would be a good time.

07:09.280 --> 07:11.040
But do you like it?

07:11.040 --> 07:16.080
Are you considering when the final ships, you might, you know, give it an install?

07:16.080 --> 07:20.320
Well, I will definitely install it, probably not on my main machine to start with.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.320
Oh, of course.

07:21.320 --> 07:22.320
Oh, of course.

07:22.320 --> 07:25.640
That's why I have this other machine to test stuff on.

07:25.640 --> 07:29.040
But yeah, I am very impressed with the progress.

07:29.040 --> 07:33.880
As I say, I've been following it on and off, and it must have been at least six months

07:33.880 --> 07:35.200
since I looked at it last.

07:35.200 --> 07:39.640
And I think it has iterated a little bit in that time, and it does seem to be improving.

07:39.640 --> 07:50.080
And you get the kind of benefits of Qt without the complexity of KDE and, you know, Plasma.

07:50.080 --> 07:55.160
And the thing is that I can make Plasma how I want it, which is essentially quite similar

07:55.160 --> 07:59.280
to LXQt, or I could just use LXQt, why bother?

07:59.280 --> 08:00.280
Yeah.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.240
I was thinking about that too for some of our production systems, that was my exact

08:03.240 --> 08:04.240
line of thinking.

08:04.240 --> 08:09.000
And while we're just like swimming deep in the Ubuntu universe, let me put this out there.

08:09.000 --> 08:16.540
If a lot of the spins of Ubuntu existed simply to offer an alternative to Unity, once Unity

08:16.540 --> 08:22.380
goes away and GNOME becomes the default desktop, it seems like there's less and less motivation

08:22.380 --> 08:28.800
for some of these distributions to exist, and now our focus might be shifting to ones

08:28.800 --> 08:32.420
that provide something completely different than Ubuntu GNOME, and that would be really

08:32.420 --> 08:39.320
low resources or super small footprints, optimized for appliance-like workloads, things like

08:39.320 --> 08:40.320
that.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.320
Do you agree?

08:41.320 --> 08:43.600
Like, maybe we're seeing a new opportunity for Ubuntu derivatives here?

08:43.600 --> 08:44.600
Well, I don't know.

08:44.600 --> 08:50.600
I think that you've always had the traditional desktop look at Ubuntu MATE, the alternative

08:50.600 --> 08:54.180
to GNOME, which is a whole new way of doing things.

08:54.180 --> 08:59.920
It's not that new to a lot of people, but in the kind of grand scheme of it, the long

08:59.920 --> 09:06.120
timeline from 20 plus years, it is still a relatively new way to interact with the computer.

09:06.120 --> 09:13.600
And people who don't want to use that new way have got plenty of options, from KDE Plasma,

09:13.600 --> 09:20.100
which is at the higher end of the resource scale, through MATE and XFCE, and now down

09:20.100 --> 09:21.920
to LXQ.

09:21.920 --> 09:30.040
So for me, it's not necessarily about these different workloads and implementations and

09:30.040 --> 09:32.440
what you're actually going to do with it.

09:32.440 --> 09:36.600
It's in some ways just more about wanting it to work a certain way.

09:36.600 --> 09:42.060
Yeah, and it's about what you want to devote your computer's resources to in time and also

09:42.060 --> 09:43.060
what matches your workflow.

09:43.060 --> 09:46.640
I just, to me, it seems like some of these lower resources distributions are appealing

09:46.640 --> 09:48.040
to me more than ever.

09:48.040 --> 09:53.360
You get a standard base, but a really nice, light, lean desktop.

09:53.360 --> 09:57.360
So I'm following LXQ with quite a bit of interest, but yeah, like I said, now is a good time

09:57.360 --> 10:02.000
to jump in and give them the feedback about the default apps and keep an eye out for new

10:02.000 --> 10:07.920
artwork coming down the pike very soon.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.880
It's a perfect sponsor for this show.

10:22.880 --> 10:25.160
They have the system.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.160
This is all they do.

10:26.160 --> 10:30.080
They focus on Linux, open source, and the ecosystem around it that really makes you

10:30.080 --> 10:37.480
money and pads the resume, like OpenStack, Azure, AWS, all of that stuff around Linux.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.680
But you can start at the very core.

10:39.680 --> 10:43.600
Learn about the basics on the command line, get involved with their self-paced, in-depth

10:43.600 --> 10:46.840
video courses, their hands-on, scenario-based labs.

10:46.840 --> 10:49.240
They spin up servers on demand when you need them.

10:49.240 --> 10:53.080
Real human being instructors are available when you need help, and a core scheduler that

10:53.080 --> 10:55.080
matches your busy schedule.

11:10.980 --> 11:17.040
So back in October last year, Canonical announced the live kernel patching service for Ubuntu

11:17.040 --> 11:18.040
16.04.

11:18.040 --> 11:24.800
Fast forward to this week, and they have announced that it's now available for Ubuntu 14.04 as

11:24.800 --> 11:25.800
well.

11:25.800 --> 11:26.800
Yeah.

11:26.800 --> 11:33.520
Users of Ubuntu 14.04 with the 64-bit kernel can get their live patch service for free

11:33.520 --> 11:34.920
up to three machines.

11:34.920 --> 11:35.920
Yeah.

11:35.920 --> 11:37.720
Or you can register a few different accounts.

11:37.720 --> 11:39.520
I'm sorry, cough.

11:39.520 --> 11:40.520
What?

11:40.520 --> 11:44.600
Or you can go to their Advantage program at Ubuntu.com slash Advantage, which honestly

11:44.600 --> 11:47.280
if I was in a business, I would probably do that.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.280
Yeah, yeah.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.240
I mean, it would be ridiculous to do it the other way.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.120
But it's interesting that they're doing it for 14.04.

11:53.120 --> 11:57.280
It shows that they do care about long-term support.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.640
Just look at 12.04 being supported.

11:59.640 --> 12:01.720
You can pay them for a bit of extra support on that.

12:01.720 --> 12:07.000
So they really are trying to compete with Red Hat, basically, aren't they?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.660
I suppose it does suggest that.

12:08.660 --> 12:13.120
To me, it also suggests that they have an XP effect happening with their old releases.

12:13.120 --> 12:19.960
I would bet you that a dirty secret of both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Ubuntu LTS is

12:19.960 --> 12:24.120
that once users install them, they essentially don't upgrade those systems until they replace

12:24.120 --> 12:25.120
those systems.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.760
Well, that's what happens in enterprise, doesn't it?

12:27.760 --> 12:28.760
Generally.

12:28.760 --> 12:29.760
Whether it's Windows or Linux.

12:29.760 --> 12:33.000
Wouldn't it be nice, though, if we could keep these systems patched and current?

12:33.000 --> 12:36.440
Now, I'm not trying to sit here and advocate that change just for change sake needs to

12:36.440 --> 12:37.440
happen.

12:37.440 --> 12:41.080
But I am trying to suggest that there is a certain level of technological progress between

12:41.080 --> 12:46.200
major Linux kernels and major daemons that would be beneficial for the Internet in whole.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.480
And so in moderation, where it made sense, it would be nice if these systems could have

12:49.480 --> 12:54.280
been upgraded much easier and not have to sit here and inject code into live memory

12:54.280 --> 12:55.280
to keep them secure.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.360
I grant you it's a clever solution.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.760
It's definitely one I would sign up for if I was in a business.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.380
I'm impressed by the service.

13:01.380 --> 13:07.840
I just think it's an unfortunate hack that we've sort of back-engineered into to replace

13:07.840 --> 13:11.120
live code and memory because we can't upgrade our systems.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.360
It sounds like you're advocating ARCH in the enterprise.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.360
I'm not.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.360
I am not doing that.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.360
I'm not saying that.

13:16.360 --> 13:20.240
However, if you do, I suggest you install the LTS kernel.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.420
That's Chris's hashtag ARCH advice.

13:22.420 --> 13:26.480
But the idea of live patching your kernel doesn't sit very well with me.

13:26.480 --> 13:27.480
Oh, really, Joe?

13:27.480 --> 13:28.480
I'm shocked.

13:28.480 --> 13:29.480
Yeah.

13:29.480 --> 13:30.480
You're shocked that I'm negative about this.

13:30.480 --> 13:32.200
Well, look, put it this way.

13:32.200 --> 13:37.600
If you've got infrastructure that is so critical that you can't spare 30 seconds to reboot

13:37.600 --> 13:42.200
it, then why don't you have a redundant server that you can switch to instantly?

13:42.200 --> 13:45.360
That's the way things are supposed to be done, right?

13:45.360 --> 13:49.240
I suppose in an ideal universe, that's probably true.

13:49.240 --> 13:54.200
So you switch to your redundant server, do your upgrade, reboot, make sure all your daemons

13:54.200 --> 13:58.280
come up, everything's working fine, switch back to it, and then do the same thing for

13:58.280 --> 13:59.280
your redundant server.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.680
I bet every different enterprise has their scenario.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.020
I could give you mine.

14:03.020 --> 14:06.720
So take for example here our OBS streaming system.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.760
If we were to reboot it, our stream goes down.

14:09.760 --> 14:10.760
Not a big deal.

14:10.760 --> 14:11.760
But there's no way to...

14:11.760 --> 14:15.240
You can't just move another system in there and continue that stream.

14:15.240 --> 14:16.240
There's no...

14:16.240 --> 14:18.280
I guess you could engineer a really complex system.

14:18.280 --> 14:22.600
But there's so much engineering involved to make that happen that it's just much easier

14:22.600 --> 14:25.840
to have one system streaming it that gets patched properly.

14:25.840 --> 14:29.920
It's just a whole other scale to try to have a redundant OBS system that we could switch

14:29.920 --> 14:34.000
to in real time to keep our stream online to apply a patch.

14:34.000 --> 14:37.800
So I could definitely understand how systems that are involved in transactions or record

14:37.800 --> 14:43.220
keeping or time keeping or log keeping or video monitoring where they're recording something,

14:43.220 --> 14:45.640
it's really hard to do a replacement system.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.400
Not everything's web servers and databases.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.400
True, true.

14:48.400 --> 14:53.800
And I suppose this is more aimed at the smaller enterprise then, the kind of people who don't

14:53.800 --> 14:57.480
have the money to have redundant service for everything.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.480
Perhaps.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.480
Perhaps.

14:59.480 --> 15:03.640
I would think this is a killer service for small and large business.

15:03.640 --> 15:08.160
Really in any kind of large enterprise, in my experience, there is a rigorous change

15:08.160 --> 15:13.200
management process when you want to install a patch and reboot.

15:13.200 --> 15:18.200
It involves, for my particular experience, it involved creating a change request form,

15:18.200 --> 15:22.120
which was a three page form, and then I had to attend a Thursday weekly meeting where

15:22.120 --> 15:25.960
I had to advocate my change in a group of people that were just there to essentially

15:25.960 --> 15:29.680
ask me why I really needed to do this and nitpick every little decision.

15:29.680 --> 15:34.320
And then once I advocated the change, I could then go schedule a time in off hours to install

15:34.320 --> 15:38.980
the patch within the next week and then I had to attend the following change control

15:38.980 --> 15:42.520
meeting to advise the committee on how my change had went.

15:42.520 --> 15:46.320
This all changes if you can start swapping code in and out of memory in real time.

15:46.320 --> 15:51.560
I sign up for this service, I let it go, I do one change control request to enable the

15:51.560 --> 15:54.320
service and do its business, and I'm done.

15:54.320 --> 15:55.920
Yeah, but is that going to wash with them?

15:55.920 --> 15:57.160
Are they going to accept that?

15:57.160 --> 15:58.160
I think so.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.160
I think if you pitch it right.

15:59.160 --> 16:04.020
I mean, I realize to you it seems like a huge difference, but to them it's, I mean to you

16:04.020 --> 16:08.840
it seems like a small nuance, but to them it's a huge difference between actively installing

16:08.840 --> 16:15.240
software, rebooting systems, making all, because that entire process involves coordinating

16:15.240 --> 16:19.400
with multiple departments and people, whereas this is something that just happens transparently

16:19.400 --> 16:20.400
in the background.

16:20.400 --> 16:25.640
But surely that isn't going to go down well, making changes transparently in the background.

16:25.640 --> 16:30.120
Even if it is security patches, it sounds like that, all that bureaucracy that you were

16:30.120 --> 16:35.880
talking about there, they wouldn't be happy with it unless they just don't know what's

16:35.880 --> 16:36.880
going on.

16:36.880 --> 16:40.820
I suppose if you sell it right, as you say, if you just say to them it's a small change.

16:40.820 --> 16:43.520
It's a bit of a straw man's argument in my case, because what I'm really trying to say

16:43.520 --> 16:48.640
is there is probably, what I'm trying to illustrate to you is there's really a large range of

16:48.640 --> 16:52.600
businesses I think this would be beneficial to, large bureaucracies to small businesses

16:52.600 --> 16:57.560
that can't just afford replacing infrastructure or setting up redundancies.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.200
So I do think it has a broad appeal.

16:59.200 --> 17:05.000
I even, as a home user, I kind of wonder, like maybe I'd want this on one of my systems

17:05.000 --> 17:10.040
or maybe the system you and I are communicating over right now is an Ubuntu LTS system.

17:10.040 --> 17:13.240
Maybe I should put it on this, because I don't often reboot this computer either.

17:13.240 --> 17:19.040
But then if you have, say, eight, nine months of patches coming in and then the power goes

17:19.040 --> 17:24.600
out and you start your system up again and you haven't tested a reboot, what happens

17:24.600 --> 17:25.600
then?

17:25.600 --> 17:26.600
What happens if something goes wrong?

17:26.600 --> 17:29.360
You've got no idea which of the patches over the last nine months it was.

17:29.360 --> 17:31.880
Well, I don't think it's quite as dramatic as that.

17:31.880 --> 17:36.840
I think it's very selective fixes that go in.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.960
And so you're not patching the user land.

17:38.960 --> 17:42.280
You're not, I don't even know if you're revving the package of the kernel.

17:42.280 --> 17:46.400
I'm not sure I should experiment with it to actually get a better understanding.

17:46.400 --> 17:52.000
But I think there's still like app get update commands you would install that would be a

17:52.000 --> 17:55.640
whole other set of updates that are separate from what you would get in the live patch.

17:55.640 --> 18:00.640
The live patch is, I believe, things that are more critical, maybe remote vulnerabilities

18:00.640 --> 18:06.200
or super critical local vulnerabilities that involve privilege escalation, something like

18:06.200 --> 18:07.200
that.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.200
I think it's pushed over live patch.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.360
I think there's only been a few things pushed over live patch.

18:10.360 --> 18:15.680
But again, this is just my rough understanding and lower critical vulnerabilities or user

18:15.680 --> 18:20.680
land vulnerabilities are still patched via the traditional package management system.

18:20.680 --> 18:26.240
But even a small server that's not doing too much, every time you do updates and you realize

18:26.240 --> 18:29.880
you need to reboot it, are you telling me you don't get a little nervous feeling when

18:29.880 --> 18:30.880
you reboot it?

18:30.880 --> 18:31.880
Oh, sure.

18:31.880 --> 18:32.880
Yeah.

18:32.880 --> 18:33.880
Even my desktop.

18:33.880 --> 18:34.880
And that's part of the thrill.

18:34.880 --> 18:35.880
I'm a bit of a thrill seeker, Joe.

18:35.880 --> 18:36.880
Yeah.

18:36.880 --> 18:42.400
I mean, if you've, as I say, if you've had nine months of patches, how much extra nervous

18:42.400 --> 18:45.520
energy are you going to have when you reboot it finally for something else?

18:45.520 --> 18:47.200
Yeah, I really should play with this, shouldn't I?

18:47.200 --> 18:51.120
I should use this system as an experiment because I wonder how that works.

18:51.120 --> 18:54.560
If you're live patching, and these are questions we could probably ask somebody at Canonical

18:54.560 --> 18:55.560
too.

18:55.560 --> 18:56.560
Maybe I'll do some digging.

18:56.560 --> 19:00.320
If you're live patching, do they remain after reboot or do you have to install packages

19:00.320 --> 19:01.400
for them to apply?

19:01.400 --> 19:04.240
As far as I know, they do stay afterwards.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.840
But yeah, we should double check that.

19:05.840 --> 19:06.840
Yeah.

19:06.840 --> 19:07.840
We should try.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.720
And I don't know where I'll update you, but I'll update you somewhere.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.720
Now this isn't the only way to keep your system secure.

19:13.720 --> 19:18.520
If you are a big subscriber to the way Docker sees the world, they have Linux Kit, which

19:18.520 --> 19:22.760
is a project that is incubating several technologies to advance Linux security.

19:22.760 --> 19:28.000
Yeah, they announced this back in April, but we didn't really learn that much about it

19:28.000 --> 19:29.500
at the time.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.800
And now more details are coming out.

19:31.800 --> 19:35.520
And it looks like they're taking kernel security very, very seriously.

19:35.520 --> 19:38.240
Yeah, I have a few thoughts about that.

19:38.240 --> 19:43.400
I wonder if this isn't Docker trying to rebrand themselves very seriously as investing in security

19:43.400 --> 19:48.160
because I think they've gotten a bit of a reputation for not taking security deeply

19:48.160 --> 19:49.160
serious.

19:49.160 --> 19:52.660
Well, there's kind of a meme, isn't there, that people download random Docker images

19:52.660 --> 19:54.220
and then never update them and stuff.

19:54.220 --> 20:00.040
And so you've got these insecure Docker images running left, right, and center.

20:00.040 --> 20:01.040
There's that.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.600
There's also the way that things were originally set up.

20:02.600 --> 20:07.100
I don't think there was signing and whatnot that people gave them quite a bit of crap

20:07.100 --> 20:08.100
for on the internet.

20:08.100 --> 20:09.940
So I think maybe this could be somewhat of a response.

20:09.940 --> 20:13.860
But either way, whatever the motivation is, it seems like the results could really be

20:13.860 --> 20:15.160
great.

20:15.160 --> 20:16.960
They have a series of projects.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.080
Some of them, some of you out there probably have heard about.

20:19.080 --> 20:22.220
We've covered WireGuard on Linux Unplugged before.

20:22.220 --> 20:26.600
This is sort of a new VPN, partly built into the Linux kernel.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.960
So it's very high performance, whereas OpenVPN is primarily in user space.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.800
But it's also using a new type of cryptography.

20:32.800 --> 20:36.440
It uses the noise protocol framework that WhatsApp uses.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.840
So a lot of fans of WireGuard out there.

20:38.840 --> 20:43.840
And it's pretty great to see Docker folks putting some effort and development behind

20:43.840 --> 20:44.840
it.

20:44.840 --> 20:48.200
Do you think their new attitude to security comes from the fact that they have got more

20:48.200 --> 20:49.480
competition now?

20:49.480 --> 20:50.480
Yes.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.480
Yes, I really do.

20:51.480 --> 20:57.400
I think in part, they are trying to maintain their hold on this container space by really

20:57.400 --> 21:01.400
being the builder of a platform for containers.

21:01.400 --> 21:04.340
Now I've got to stop right here before we get all heady and start talking business terms

21:04.340 --> 21:05.440
about containers.

21:05.440 --> 21:07.480
Let's get real for a second.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.140
Containers are commodity stuff here.

21:09.140 --> 21:14.480
They're relying on technology that's built into the Linux kernel, their namespaces.

21:14.480 --> 21:18.820
They're relying on technology either in system D or things that they bolt on.

21:18.820 --> 21:21.520
But it's something that comes baked into the product now.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.840
Everybody's Linux can do it.

21:22.840 --> 21:27.760
So Docker doesn't have anything unique to bring to the market there because everybody's

21:27.760 --> 21:29.040
got it.

21:29.040 --> 21:32.820
But what they do have is all of the ecosystem and tools around it.

21:32.820 --> 21:38.440
If they can be a platform provider where with Linux kit you can plug in your own components

21:38.440 --> 21:42.960
but still have association with Docker or the Docker hub, then they're still in the

21:42.960 --> 21:43.960
game.

21:43.960 --> 21:47.900
Then they can add a real layer of value, quote unquote, that's what they like to call it,

21:47.900 --> 21:52.200
to the container, quote unquote, space, which is otherwise just commodity software now built

21:52.200 --> 21:53.200
into Linux.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.520
But what about their branding problems?

21:55.520 --> 21:59.000
You mean around Moby, their project to build your own Docker environment?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.000
I'm not sure.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.880
I am still confused by Project Moby and all of it.

22:02.880 --> 22:08.800
Yeah, you've got Docker, Moby, and Linux kit, which if you really dig into it, you can understand.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.280
But I think a lot of people are struggling to understand where it all fits together.

22:12.280 --> 22:13.280
Yeah.

22:13.280 --> 22:16.400
Out of all of it, Linux kit's the one I like the most because I like the fact that they're

22:16.400 --> 22:20.120
throwing real development hours behind some important projects.

22:20.120 --> 22:23.960
There's another one in here that I think's neat called Landlock, which is essentially

22:23.960 --> 22:27.160
a competitor to SE Linux and AppArmor.

22:27.160 --> 22:31.580
It's a quote unquote LSM, Joe, which stands for Linux Security Module, and it's being

22:31.580 --> 22:33.160
incubated by Linux kit.

22:33.160 --> 22:38.440
This Landlock one uses extended Berkeley packet filters to hook small programs into the Linux

22:38.440 --> 22:39.440
kernel.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.960
Do we really need another one?

22:41.960 --> 22:45.480
Apparently we need one that's been designed for the container age, Joe.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.840
We need one for the container age.

22:46.840 --> 22:47.840
That's what they say.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.520
I don't know if I'm convinced.

22:49.520 --> 22:50.520
Yeah.

22:50.520 --> 22:54.680
Well, a Google developer has launched a kernel self-protection project in 2016, and now it's

22:54.680 --> 22:56.920
being incubated by them.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.520
I don't really understand what it does.

22:58.520 --> 22:59.680
This one sounds pretty cool, though.

22:59.680 --> 23:03.760
It's working on protections to help mitigate memory corruption risks.

23:03.760 --> 23:08.240
Well, one undeniably good thing about this is they are committed to pushing all this

23:08.240 --> 23:11.080
stuff upstream, so everyone's going to benefit from it.

23:11.080 --> 23:12.080
Yeah.

23:12.080 --> 23:15.360
Speaking of everyone benefiting, I think one of the most important open source projects

23:15.360 --> 23:20.120
out there right now is the GNU PG project, and they have a fundraiser, a rally.

23:20.120 --> 23:24.160
Yeah, rather than just one-off donations, they're looking for more of the kind of Patreon

23:24.160 --> 23:25.160
style model.

23:25.160 --> 23:30.600
They want people to donate a couple of bucks a month to keep the development going, which

23:30.600 --> 23:34.520
is a good idea, really, because it's all well and good to raise big chunks of cash here

23:34.520 --> 23:38.780
and there, but if you can just get a little bit coming in every month, then you've got

23:38.780 --> 23:43.040
a much better idea of how you're going to balance your books and how many developers

23:43.040 --> 23:44.040
you can employ.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.040
Yeah, you can budget.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.040
Yeah, exactly.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.040
Budget.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.040
That's the word.

23:48.040 --> 23:52.120
Now, it's not something that I, to be honest, use that regularly.

23:52.120 --> 23:58.240
I don't use it for my emails, but it's something that projects that I use use, if you know

23:58.240 --> 23:59.240
what I mean.

23:59.240 --> 24:00.240
Yeah.

24:00.240 --> 24:04.360
And they make a great case in here, too, that even if you don't personally use GNU PG, journalists

24:04.360 --> 24:08.920
around the world right now are being trained on using GNU PG to communicate securely with

24:08.920 --> 24:10.280
their sources.

24:10.280 --> 24:11.440
That is massive.

24:11.440 --> 24:15.800
If you just look at it from the activist, journalist, and lawyer's standpoint, it's

24:15.800 --> 24:17.680
worth it even if you don't personally use it.

24:17.680 --> 24:23.760
But I think right now, at this moment in time, it is a more valuable project than ever, and

24:23.760 --> 24:28.120
there are multiple governments discussing getting backdoors to encryption, about the

24:28.120 --> 24:32.520
going dark phenomenon, quote, unquote, that James Clapper was just quoted as saying last

24:32.520 --> 24:34.300
week.

24:34.300 --> 24:38.980
There is an active effort to pressure encryption manufacturers or whatever the term they're

24:38.980 --> 24:43.580
going to use, they're going to come up with some term to give governments backdoor access.

24:43.580 --> 24:47.480
That means open source projects like GNU PG are going to be under more pressure than ever

24:47.480 --> 24:48.920
and more important than ever.

24:48.920 --> 24:52.200
And they have modest goals here.

24:52.200 --> 24:56.700
Their primary goal is to fully fund three developers.

24:56.700 --> 25:02.080
And they're looking for 15,000 euros per month, which seems a little low to me for three developers,

25:02.080 --> 25:04.400
but that's going by the standards here in the States.

25:04.400 --> 25:10.280
They say their stretch goal is twice that, 30 euros, 30,000 euros per month.

25:10.280 --> 25:17.240
Again, that's like here in the States, that'd be like maybe 400,000, 420,000 a year to pay

25:17.240 --> 25:20.640
for three developers.

25:20.640 --> 25:25.120
That would pay for maybe two developers here in Washington, depending on their position.

25:25.120 --> 25:28.920
I mean, when you're working on something like GNU PG, these are not beginner jobs.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.920
Yeah, this isn't a bit of Python, is it?

25:30.920 --> 25:32.160
This is some serious stuff.

25:32.160 --> 25:35.720
I honestly would have liked to see them put these numbers higher because I think they

25:35.720 --> 25:40.800
deserve this work and it's one of the most vital, vital open source projects right now.

25:40.800 --> 25:41.800
It's my personal opinion.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.480
This is more important than ever.

25:43.480 --> 25:49.240
And so you can go to GNU PG.org slash donate if you'd like to get in on the rally.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.740
I hope they make it.

25:50.740 --> 25:53.000
It seems like a pretty worthwhile project.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Yeah, yeah.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Fingers crossed.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
All right.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.240
