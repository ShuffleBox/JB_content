00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,900
Hello, and welcome to Linux Action News, episode 266, recorded on November 9th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,900
I'm Chris.

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,900
And I'm Wes.

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,900
Hello, Wes.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,620
Let's do the news.

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,660
We start this week with an observation.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,380
It was not a particularly busy news week in Linux, but there are a few things we wanted

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:25,380
you to know about.

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:31,200
Big Neomundu Summit, which is just wrapped up in Prague after a couple year hiatus.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,960
Yeah, unfortunately, we could not attend this year just due to scheduling conflicts.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,720
But the company did live stream the event.

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,520
And we will have a link to each day in the notes.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,480
Sheldon Worth kicked off the three-day event with a bit of a keynote.

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,720
All right.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,720
Hello, everybody.

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,720
How's this working?

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,720
Can you hear me at the back OK?

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,440
What a treat to be here in Prague with all of you.

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,880
Thank you for making the trip.

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:08,420
It is my greatest, greatest, greatest pleasure to host you here.

21
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:15,640
And I'm extremely excited for what we're going to be talking about, what we're going to achieve,

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,800
and what we're going to enable other people to do with open source.

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,000
The community-focused event followed multiple internal company get-togethers that took place

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,360
at the same venue, with Mark Shettleworth noting that they had over 500 canonical staffers

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,060
there during the Q&A portion of his talk.

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,760
Why this specific place?

27
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,760
Yes.

28
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,180
Because we were 500 people last week, and we needed at least 500 rooms, and this place

29
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,880
has 800.

30
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:52,880
Yeah, and as that Q&A rolled on, Mark proceeded to touch on the tension between the feeling

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,080
of being part of something larger and the tension of working from home, and how Canonical

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,660
had to adapt during the pandemic as well.

33
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:07,240
So at Canonical, I got to tell you, we work pretty darn hard, and we work from home, right,

34
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,520
which kind of means everybody gets a corner office, which is great.

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:22,440
But the times that we get together are critical to the health and sanity of a distributed

36
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
workforce.

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,280
So there's this tension, right, like I think you wouldn't work at Canonical if you didn't

38
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,640
want to be working at home, but then if you were only working at home, you wouldn't feel

39
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,520
part of something much, much bigger.

40
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,800
So for me, it's really, really important that everyone at Canonical makes a commitment twice

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,040
a year to get together, not just with their own team, but with lots of other teams.

42
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:56,360
And I love watching the kind of experiences that people have, because people who've just

43
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,520
joined the company are working inside one team for up to six months, working on one

44
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:06,120
problem, and then suddenly they realize, wow, I'm in the middle of all of these interesting,

45
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,360
potent, difficult, important threads, right?

46
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,880
And that's really important.

47
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,640
The pandemic, you'd think that the pandemic would be really easy for a remote first organization.

48
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
It wasn't.

49
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,020
It really wasn't, right?

50
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,560
And I can tell you, we really missed this feeling of getting together, right, and working

51
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:34,960
stuff out in person, reaffirming our commitments and our relationships in person, right?

52
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,100
So how do we make that work?

53
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,960
How do we make that work?

54
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:43,260
Well, what I think is fun is that we try to pick interesting places, right?

55
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,560
This is a very interesting place for lots of different reasons, right?

56
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,280
First, lots of James Bond movies have been shot here over the years.

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,280
And second, beer is cheaper than water.

58
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,200
And third, the non-alcoholic beer is very good.

59
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,760
So it seems like there are lots of great reasons to be here.

60
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,000
And when we're in a place, we need a venue where we can all be together.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,840
This event might be the restart of the Ubuntu Summits.

62
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,960
And unlike the Ubuntu Dev Summits of the past, Canonical's intention this time around seems

63
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,960
to be aiming for a bigger tent, an opportunity for them to hear from the community and a

64
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:32,040
chance for Canonical to showcase their solutions and ideas.

65
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,200
Microsoft has a new version of.NET and one of its headline features is bigger, better,

66
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,800
badder Linux support.

67
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,320
Yes, dear audience member, you heard that right.

68
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:49,160
One of.NET 7's big new features is improved support and performance on Linux.

69
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:55,280
Now it even has native ARM64 support and yes, IBM Power as well.

70
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,280
Wow.

71
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,280
Okay.

72
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,160
I mean, there's a lot in.NET 7, no doubt.

73
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,160
That's really kind of a Coda radio story.

74
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,800
But I was just thinking in the Linux terms, if I could travel back in time to young Linux

75
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:16,120
using Chris in the late 90s, and I could tell him that one day Microsoft would have this

76
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,640
product called.NET, this development language called.NET, and they were releasing this

77
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:27,580
big new version and they were promoting its new Linux features, I could only imagine how

78
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,200
young me would respond.

79
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,920
I would guess his first question would probably be, how'd you get so damn fat?

80
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,680
And then his second question would be, why did Microsoft pick such a stupid name like

81
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
.NET?

82
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,440
Sadly, even in 2022, we don't have answers for those questions yet.

83
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:49,360
But sticking with Microsoft for just a moment longer, a surprising amount of you out there

84
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,080
were upset when the death of the team's desktop Linux app was announced.

85
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,320
Well, good news.

86
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:02,080
This week, Microsoft launched the team's progressive web app for desktop Linux.

87
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,360
And you know what?

88
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,280
This might actually be an upgrade for y'all.

89
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,640
I mean, typically, when we talk about a desktop app getting discontinued in favor of a web

90
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,000
app, that's a downgrade.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,280
But teams was always just a web app in different clothing.

92
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,320
And now this PWA brings the Linux version at least closer to being feature parity with

93
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,600
the Windows teams version.

94
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,800
This is how Microsoft puts it in their announcement, they say, quote, a progressive web app enables

95
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,080
us to ship the latest Microsoft Teams feature faster to our Linux customers, and helps us

96
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,560
bridge the gaps between the team's desktop client on Linux and Windows.

97
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,480
The PWA experience is available for both edge and Chrome browsers running on Linux.

98
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,000
Now that's all well and good.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,400
And I'm happy to see investment on Linux here.

100
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,880
But it kind of sounds like maybe Firefox is being left out of this little browser bunch.

101
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,520
If anyone out there has tried to let us know.

102
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,840
That's one bit of research we're happy to outsource.

103
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,040
The standards body behind OpenGL, OpenCL, Vulkan, and some of your other favorites out

104
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,040
there have announced their next graphics API.

105
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,480
And it's called Cameras.

106
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:23,600
Yes, the Kronos group is working on this new API with the European Machine Vision Association.

107
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,480
The work started back in March, and it's aiming to create a royalty free standard for controlling

108
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:35,640
camera system runtimes across embedded, mobile, industrial, extended reality, automotive and

109
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,200
scientific markets.

110
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Yeah, you know, having messed around a little bit with embedded remote camera systems, I

111
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,720
can see the need for that.

112
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
It is tricky.

113
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:51,720
So this Cameras API would sit sort of between like software using say FFmpeg or whatever

114
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
it might be.

115
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,560
And then the hardware and transports that talk to the actual hardware, be it attached

116
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,920
directly or over the network.

117
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,080
They intend to also support multiple programming languages, and they're going to have a loadable

118
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,800
layer system just like Vulkan and some of the other standards do.

119
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,120
You can think of this layer feature as a command dispatch system that enables developers to

120
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,160
use installable layers for validation, profiling, debugging, things like that.

121
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,960
One question that's still in my mind at this point is what does the introduction of Cameras

122
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,080
mean for Lib Camera?

123
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
That's a good question.

124
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
We don't know.

125
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,120
I mean, Lib Camera, I think that's a Raspberry Pi project.

126
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,880
So it's potentially single vendor where this wants to sort of create a universal standard.

127
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,360
I mean, you know what you do when you have too many standards or in this case, too many

128
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
APIs.

129
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,960
You've got to do the right thing, Wes, and create a universal API that just covers everyone's

130
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
use cases.

131
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,960
That'll solve it.

132
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:57,360
A quick mention for the new FWUPd release this week, version 1.8.7.

133
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,840
The headline feature is more hardware support from Star Labs, including their upcoming Star

134
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,460
Fighter laptop, though we might be most excited about the experimental support for Intel's

135
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,280
discrete GPUs.

136
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,300
Also included is support for fingerprint lengthy devices, Anker's Thunderbolt 4 Mini Hub,

137
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,840
Elan Haptic hardware, and more than a few other devices.

138
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,600
Some new features this time around, well, they include the ability to measure system

139
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:33,600
integrity when you're installing UEFI updates, and support for XZ compressed metadata, which

140
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,240
should reduce the bandwidth used to download firmware files by approximately 25%.

141
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,960
We'll link to the release notes because we're really just scratching the surface on this

142
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,400
one.

143
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,680
Linode.com slash LAN.

144
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,660
That's where you go to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

145
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,560
It's a great way to support the show while you're checking out Linode.

146
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,160
They make cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible.

147
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,060
It's how we run everything we've built in the last few years, including our new website,

148
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,760
or if we wanted to check out something that requires a GPU, or we wanted to build a matrix

149
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
community.

150
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,360
If you want to do anything from running something for your business, or hosting something for

151
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,000
yourself, Linode's the way to go.

152
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,200
30% to 50% cheaper than those big hyperscalers, and a machine that's going to fit your needs

153
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
perfectly.

154
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,600
And on top of that, great performance.

155
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,320
They've got 11 data centers for you to choose from today, and a dozen more coming on next

156
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
year.

157
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,120
And great features such as object storage, cloud firewall backups, and Kubernetes support,

158
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,120
and so much more.

159
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,560
So go build something, go learn something, and support the show.

160
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,100
Check out Linode by going to linode.com slash lan.

161
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:45,400
Get that $100, and support the show, linode.com slash lan.

162
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,120
And also, thank you to Kalyde.

163
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Kalyde is an endpoint security solution that uses the most powerful, untapped resource

164
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,400
in IT, end users.

165
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,800
Instead of forcing old-school MDMs on your users, Kalyde sends them security recommendations

166
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,880
via Slack.

167
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,900
Kalyde will automatically notify your team when their devices are insecure, and give

168
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,480
them step-by-step instructions on how to solve the problem.

169
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,400
By reaching out to employees via a friendly Slack DM, and educating them about company

170
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:23,160
policies, Kalyde can help you build a culture in which everyone contributes to security,

171
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,440
because everyone understands how and why to do it.

172
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,360
For IT admins, Kalyde provides a single dashboard that lets you monitor the security of your

173
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,280
entire fleet for Mac, Windows, and of course, Linux.

174
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:46,400
So that's Kalyde, user-centered, cross-platform, endpoint security for teams that Slack.

175
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,320
You can meet your compliance goals by putting users first.

176
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,600
Visit Kalyde.com slash LAN to find out how.

180
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,280
We end this week with a nice fireside chat between Pat Gelsinger and Linus Torvalds.

181
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,880
The casual conversation was conducted at Intel's Innovation 2022 event, where Intel's CEO got

182
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,160
to sit down and have a wide range of topics to be discussed with Mr. Torvalds.

183
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,640
Intel Innovation is their developer-focused event that they say spotlights the tools,

184
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,240
training, and community to empower the world's developers to create what's next.

185
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,600
So the topics are more developer- and ecosystem-focused than you typically get in some of these fireside

186
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,840
chats with Linus.

187
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,320
One of my favorite moments is when Linus talks about what's most important about open source

188
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,720
to him personally.

189
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:00,160
And I think one of the most important parts to open source for me has been that everybody

190
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,920
needs to feel like they are in equal footing.

191
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:12,640
We've had a lot of companies who do dual licensing, and it's perfectly legally fine, but it tends

192
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:22,080
to result in politics and internal strife about the project when one company or one

193
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:26,040
entity has more rights than the other entities.

194
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:34,800
So I've personally tried to always keep all my projects that very clearly I'm not special,

195
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,600
I'm the top-level maintainer when it comes to the kernel, but if somebody else does a

196
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,720
better job and one day that will happen, they will take over because I don't have any special

197
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,160
rights except for the fact that people trust me because I've been doing it for 30 plus

198
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,160
years.

199
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,760
It does seem like open source trust, this idea of contributing to the community and

200
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,000
having the exposure of the community and then finally the trust of the community.

201
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yes.

202
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,040
But I mean, so you say, I don't actually like the notion of contributing to the community

203
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:14,840
because that implies a certain amount of altruism that I'm not a huge believer in.

204
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:22,440
So I really think it's more like you're not contributing to the community.

205
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:28,720
What you're doing is you're trying to make a project better for yourself and the rules

206
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,560
of the project end up then meaning that as you're making it better for yourself and trying

207
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:40,500
to improve your own situation, you kind of indirectly contribute to the community.

208
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:47,860
But you should always be motivated by your needs and that's actually how a lot of these

209
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:54,560
open source projects, including very much the kernel, have improved so much is because

210
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,680
I'm looking at all we've done in the last 25 years and none of it was stuff that I needed

211
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:07,260
or I wanted because as far as I was concerned, 25 years ago, the system pretty much did what

212
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,260
I needed.

213
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,840
There's also this moment when things get a bit real.

214
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:17,120
Linus tells Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger that people don't seem very happy at Intel anymore.

215
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
I think everybody knows that issue.

216
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:27,720
The problems on the execution side have been pretty painful for everybody and I don't see

217
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,920
any of the hardware and fab issues.

218
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:39,000
What I have seen are kind of the fallout from the Intel software development standpoint

219
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:48,000
where the last few years have not been quite as ebullient as they were before and people

220
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,020
have not been as happy with being inside of Intel because I don't think Intel has necessarily

221
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:58,360
been a very happy place for a few years and I'm hoping that's changing.

222
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:05,120
Well that's certainly my job to change it as well and we're getting on it as we rebuild

223
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,880
and obviously having events like this one are about rebuilding our commitment, our engagement

224
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,280
with the community, participating, driving standards as well.

225
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,960
Linus then goes on to stress how vital hardware documentation is and how Intel could lead

226
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:27,520
there, but another of my favorite moments was when Linus shared his thoughts on companies

227
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,840
like Intel using software to limit hardware features for marketing purposes.

228
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:40,840
And since I have your ear and this may be cut out, the thing I sometimes despise about

229
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,920
different companies and Intel has had that problem is when you do market segmentation

230
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:53,760
where certain features only exist in certain markets that aren't necessarily as available

231
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,720
as others and I'm thinking of things like the transactional memory.

232
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:07,840
I mean it's gone now, maybe it's never coming back, but that was very painful for us when

233
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:14,600
only certain server CPUs had it and the people who actually needed to develop for it couldn't

234
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:21,920
access it easily on their own desktops and that's I think an area where Intel can maybe

235
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:28,360
improve and not let the market segmentation drive these kind of technical issues that

236
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,840
make it hard for developers.

237
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,560
You tell them Linus and respect to Intel for leaving that bit in the interview, they could

238
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,760
have cut that criticism.

239
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,160
Overall though it's a friendly low key chat, it's about 29 minutes long and we recommend

240
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
it.

241
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,280
