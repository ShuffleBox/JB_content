00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
hello freak bitches welcome to another episode of the bro joke and experience

00:05.760 --> 00:12.200
and on this episode I welcome my friend who's difficult to describe fascinated

00:12.200 --> 00:18.720
by him and I hope you'll be too and he is weird and brilliant and sometimes

00:18.720 --> 00:23.200
totally insufferable I'm gonna jump ahead just a little bit because the

00:23.200 --> 00:30.840
intro goes on for a bit it's always good to see you buddy I'm so happy you came

00:30.840 --> 00:36.680
on man yeah it's great to be on the show your audience is just so different from

00:36.680 --> 00:41.080
your normal Apple users and that's a good thing it's cool well you know I was

00:41.080 --> 00:45.600
an Apple user way before I did this show I've been a fan of yours Macintosh since

00:45.600 --> 00:49.280
the 1980s hmm haha well you know we just kind of

00:49.280 --> 00:54.400
figured that out even though Apple is big it's still like half a percent of

00:54.400 --> 00:57.720
the total users people who listen to your show are a different group they're

00:57.720 --> 01:04.460
weird well that's good so you must be a fan of the show then right I am I am a

01:04.460 --> 01:09.520
fan I mean it's nice to sit back in the car and listen to you ran I've always

01:09.520 --> 01:14.480
liked you well uh appreciate that what do you think of that what is what is

01:14.480 --> 01:18.320
your takeaway from that crazy clip something feels wrong and I can't quite

01:18.320 --> 01:21.600
pinpoint it well one thing that's wrong is that Joe Rogan never interviewed

01:21.600 --> 01:24.720
Steve jobs yeah that's obvious but I'm trying to think of it from the

01:24.720 --> 01:30.320
perspective of what if you know and and I heard some weird compression artifacts

01:30.320 --> 01:35.140
and that really gave it away for me yeah it's like the speech wasn't consistent

01:35.140 --> 01:39.740
between words right that kind of gave it away and it didn't sound like jobs to me

01:39.740 --> 01:45.220
I don't know if there's something about the cadence of his speed or like even

01:45.220 --> 01:50.640
the quality of it it was totally off for me there's parts that kind of sound

01:50.640 --> 01:54.280
like jobs but so this is you can listen to the entire thing it's a 19 minute

01:54.280 --> 02:00.760
interview over at podcast.ai and the entire 19 minutes is generated by

02:00.760 --> 02:06.000
artificial intelligence what about the script I wonder I think if you dig into

02:06.000 --> 02:08.480
it they'd probably tell you they they're actually talking they're taking

02:08.480 --> 02:13.160
suggestions and and topics for future ones because it was that the

02:13.160 --> 02:16.960
conversational quality was kind of awkward you know what made me think of

02:16.960 --> 02:21.960
you're my concern is is like are our days number I mean you point this thing

02:21.960 --> 02:25.200
at the JB back catalog you could probably just generate future episodes

02:25.200 --> 02:28.880
you know what I mean would they be better I don't know but maybe we could

02:28.880 --> 02:35.040
take a week off it's office hours with me Chris

02:36.720 --> 02:41.880
hello everyone we're back in the studio Brent's here hey Brent hey

02:41.880 --> 02:49.120
mumble rooms here too hey mumble room hello we just have a few folks in there

02:49.120 --> 02:53.160
and in the quiet listening join us on a Tuesday at noon Brent you're still here

02:53.160 --> 02:59.240
yes somehow I'm still here is today the last day are we taking bets according to

02:59.240 --> 03:02.640
my schedule because I happen to check it this morning first time in a few weeks

03:02.640 --> 03:07.040
apparently I'm supposed to leave tomorrow well you got another trip to

03:07.040 --> 03:10.960
get to as well don't you it's true I am getting home hanging out with the furry

03:10.960 --> 03:15.240
pets my brother's pets and mine because he's doing a small trip and then a few

03:15.240 --> 03:18.880
days later he and I are driving across Canada that's a long drive what are you

03:18.880 --> 03:22.800
didn't get enough road trip it's like three days if you do it well really how

03:22.800 --> 03:28.620
is that possible two drivers ah right yeah two drivers no it's gonna be

03:28.620 --> 03:32.520
intense and we're not going across the entire thing you know we're starting in

03:32.520 --> 03:36.520
the eastern end of BC so we're starting at one end of one of the provinces and

03:36.520 --> 03:42.160
we're driving to northern Ontario which is not we're maybe doing a third of the

03:42.160 --> 03:45.160
country I would say you're just a road trip pro now it's no big third of the

03:45.160 --> 03:49.240
country it's no big whatever we're going to hang out with some family and stuff

03:49.240 --> 03:52.680
and pick up two and a half of my motorcycles that I have there and bring

03:52.680 --> 03:57.520
them back and then not too long after that you may be off to another event too

03:57.520 --> 04:05.920
I almost forgot about that yeah I across much water event I think that's all we

04:05.920 --> 04:09.400
can say at this point yeah we'll see we'll see we'll leave it at that we'll

04:09.400 --> 04:12.560
leave it at that for now and while you're gone we'll just have that podcast

04:12.560 --> 04:16.380
on AI bot stand in oh thanks so we'll just have it you know what's great is we

04:16.380 --> 04:21.080
we have all of your tracks individually so we'll just have drew bundle up and

04:21.080 --> 04:25.320
feed it to that thing and then it can just generate a Brent co-host while

04:25.320 --> 04:28.680
you're traveling okay problem solved right yeah now we just need a way to

04:28.680 --> 04:33.600
generate the video version of you for Jupiter tube we're gonna solve that

04:33.600 --> 04:36.680
that sounds a little more difficult actually especially if you need it to

04:36.680 --> 04:41.000
lip-sync with the yeah maybe maybe we could just have someone like just do

04:41.000 --> 04:45.320
that thing where we just kind of cut your lips out we just have somebody

04:45.320 --> 04:53.360
sitting there upside down try their best to match the generated speech should be

04:53.360 --> 04:58.040
fine you'd be fine yeah so you're not gonna get any rest are you gonna get

04:58.040 --> 05:01.120
some downtime while your brother's traveling I suppose yeah I guess I got

05:01.120 --> 05:08.800
two days yeah there's somewhere but I'm also needing to repack you know laundry

05:08.800 --> 05:11.600
and I have to start thinking about firewood for the winter because that's

05:11.600 --> 05:16.240
my main method of eating my space and I gotta say with the trips this year I

05:16.240 --> 05:20.200
cannot spend much yeah much attention on that I actually Alex was figuring it out

05:20.200 --> 05:27.280
when we saw him in California and he discovered because I don't know he's

05:27.280 --> 05:30.680
interested in my life perhaps he discovered that I've been in the US more

05:30.680 --> 05:35.400
this year than I've been in Canada and we're slowly converting it's true yeah

05:35.400 --> 05:39.080
we're gonna make you a native eventually well I mean I've pretty much worked out

05:39.080 --> 05:43.320
all the A's and a boots yeah we've pretty much got rid all those I noticed

05:43.320 --> 05:48.400
you saying I'm just trying to help you make you feel at home you know so I'm

05:48.400 --> 05:53.560
just curious what are your impressions from the last few weeks is a bit hectic

05:53.560 --> 05:58.920
was it was it crazier than you were expecting was it more kind of just

05:58.920 --> 06:03.200
always things happening or was it about what you were coming in with in terms of

06:03.200 --> 06:07.440
just how much we've been doing really since you got here yeah really I think

06:07.440 --> 06:13.200
it's actually I had last year's trip to work with I think had I gone into this

06:13.200 --> 06:19.720
year and not had that experience it would have been easily overwhelming last

06:19.720 --> 06:26.480
year we did great I think we had a more relaxed schedule would you say I would

06:26.480 --> 06:29.960
say we probably had more time in places you know like we spent it felt like a

06:29.960 --> 06:34.000
week in Salt Lake City or four or five days at least yeah that was nice yeah

06:34.000 --> 06:38.640
which was not the case this time I love how you thought this was gonna be the

06:38.640 --> 06:45.400
easy trip but it turned out so hard that I swore I'd never do this again that's

06:45.400 --> 06:50.360
how bad it was a guy who lives full-time in an RV swore he'd never do another

06:50.360 --> 06:54.960
road trip like this again I'm done yeah it was a lot harder than I expected and

06:54.960 --> 07:00.680
I think more grueling and I think in part because I haven't road tripped as

07:00.680 --> 07:06.640
much so like you don't just like I guess you don't just like pick right up and do

07:06.640 --> 07:09.560
seven-hour drive days like it's no big deal I guess you kind of have to work

07:09.560 --> 07:12.680
your way to it and I think towards the road towards the end of the road trip I

07:12.680 --> 07:17.000
was actually my stamina was building again just it was a little more

07:17.000 --> 07:22.480
exhausting so I drove the RV the entire time and you and hadia traded off on the

07:22.480 --> 07:27.640
car and so we'd get to somewhere in it and I had just been driving all day long

07:27.640 --> 07:32.120
so I just was always kind of behind on energy and a little more exhausted and

07:32.120 --> 07:36.960
then when we weren't driving as you know it was always a show day and often it

07:36.960 --> 07:41.720
meant that show prep had to happen after like seven hours of driving which was

07:41.720 --> 07:48.000
also ideal and our schedule at the best of case like when you're here in studio

07:48.000 --> 07:52.240
and everything's working well and your home is home and not in the RV repair

07:52.240 --> 07:57.400
shop or on the road even that schedules a little tight right you you've been

07:57.400 --> 08:01.680
doing it for a long time but so there's this rhythm and I think throwing you on

08:01.680 --> 08:07.760
the road with all of the mysteries that are what could happen on the road really

08:07.760 --> 08:11.560
adds to the tension there and like you said if you're driving for seven hours

08:11.560 --> 08:16.320
you can't really work on shows like or do business stuff oh fair and it was the

08:16.320 --> 08:19.360
end of a quarter beginning of a quarter which is just not a great time for a

08:19.360 --> 08:22.960
business owner to be on the road so I was having to deal with that stuff and

08:22.960 --> 08:28.040
not always successfully that was just a matter of timing you know I think the

08:28.040 --> 08:32.240
one thing we timed well was the weather was very tolerable the entire time and

08:32.240 --> 08:37.360
we really I think time the bottom of gas prices you know because they were coming

08:37.360 --> 08:41.080
back up as we were returning home and they've continued to go up as we've been

08:41.080 --> 08:45.000
home so I think you know that was the intention of when we time this was let's

08:45.000 --> 08:49.640
not fry ourselves and let's not bankrupt ourselves on gas we did

08:49.640 --> 08:53.040
accomplish those two things but what I didn't think about is let's not do it at

08:53.040 --> 08:55.560
the end of a quarter beginning of a quarter that's a business thing you just

08:55.560 --> 09:00.880
got to think of and then what happened was we had technical challenges back here

09:00.880 --> 09:03.680
at home base back here at the studio while we were down in California we had

09:03.680 --> 09:08.640
failures here and that created all kinds of disruption that just sort of threw

09:08.640 --> 09:13.280
everything in the entire manufacturing pipeline out of whack it was like a

09:13.280 --> 09:19.440
domino effect that happened and it started really kind of minor stuff you

09:19.440 --> 09:22.960
know things went okay for the most part but like just small thing like our

09:22.960 --> 09:26.240
recording gear didn't work at one of the beat-ups it's like a small thing I'm

09:26.240 --> 09:30.720
taking full blame on that one but it's it's one of those concepts which is you

09:30.720 --> 09:33.680
know we bought a new recorder which is the same recorder we've used for years

09:33.680 --> 09:40.320
and just grabbed an SD card the morning that we took off and never really tested

09:40.320 --> 09:45.120
it and that broke one of my sort of cardinal rules which is test absolutely

09:45.120 --> 09:48.200
everything even if you think it's gonna be totally fine and I was like no we're

09:48.200 --> 09:51.960
good like we've used this a million times and that was the beginning of that

09:51.960 --> 09:57.320
mistake I think and we got to the event and had some SD card errors and it was

09:57.320 --> 10:02.480
the only SD card we had on hand which is also a thing no backups I have a bunch

10:02.480 --> 10:05.800
of SD cards but I had left them in the RV yeah we were at the meetup when we

10:05.800 --> 10:10.240
discovered the SD card is yeah and we're at the meetup and so I couldn't get any

10:10.240 --> 10:14.200
audio with our recorder which was kind of sad because those little interviews

10:14.200 --> 10:18.240
that I get to do with with fans are really fun yeah you did a few on your

10:18.240 --> 10:22.080
phone which was surprisingly good considering the space but it's not no

10:22.080 --> 10:25.840
no I think it was a bit of foreshadowing wasn't it and you know you said something

10:25.840 --> 10:30.920
there that I realized also is we didn't properly get to test all the different

10:30.920 --> 10:35.160
production like each show has a slightly different production line because they

10:35.160 --> 10:38.680
have different aspects to them or the different co-hosts yeah different

10:38.680 --> 10:42.280
requirements and we didn't test all of them before we left because again time

10:42.280 --> 10:46.880
well you would really have to do at least a week's worth of shows yeah from

10:46.880 --> 10:52.240
the RV pretending that the studio isn't available to you before we even left

10:52.240 --> 10:57.440
which is just not possible just wasn't time I mean we were leaving under such a

10:57.440 --> 11:02.520
tight timeline so you know that was our bad we didn't get a proper we didn't get

11:02.520 --> 11:09.480
a proper pre-show pre-flight test in and so we just kind of didn't expect

11:09.480 --> 11:14.080
problems because in fact one show like Kota radio went just fine when X action

11:14.080 --> 11:19.880
news went fine on the road then self-hosted 80 came around and it was

11:19.880 --> 11:23.120
one of those problems where we were having an audio issue where the audio

11:23.120 --> 11:28.200
just sounded squelchy and yeah really clappy and also too quiet at the same

11:28.200 --> 11:32.000
time that was the audio going out in the live stream but nowhere in any point

11:32.000 --> 11:36.160
where we could monitor not anywhere in the studio or in my headphones could we

11:36.160 --> 11:41.000
hear it turned out to be an issue with how our jack processing was processing

11:41.000 --> 11:45.440
the signal from the RV but there was no visual indicator none of the VU meters

11:45.440 --> 11:48.900
showed it and of course when you're operating a studio remotely which we

11:48.900 --> 11:51.600
were for self-hosted it was streaming through the studio there was no visual

11:51.600 --> 11:54.040
indication of any problems so we didn't know anything was wrong until we were

11:54.040 --> 11:58.120
live and people were like hey you guys don't sound very good and we're like oh

11:58.120 --> 12:01.280
what and it wasn't even the Barry White thing which we're used to yeah that

12:01.280 --> 12:04.960
hasn't showed up in a little bit it just was unusable well and the thing that

12:04.960 --> 12:09.840
grabbed me was it's an issue in the studio that we've never run into before

12:09.840 --> 12:13.560
yeah of course right yeah and so it wasn't like the road gear that we hadn't

12:13.560 --> 12:17.480
tested in a year or whatever it was the setup that gets used multiple times a

12:17.480 --> 12:21.200
week and this is yeah we had it we had an edge case and no real explanation yet

12:21.200 --> 12:25.920
as to why that happened we tried a series yeah yeah we have theories but we

12:25.920 --> 12:28.960
haven't been able to fully reproduce that one and then when we were

12:28.960 --> 12:34.960
attempting to troubleshoot that I use a tool called rusk desk one word rust desk

12:34.960 --> 12:40.400
freaking great it is great I loved it to remote desktop tool for the win like

12:40.400 --> 12:44.720
total team viewer killer and I rust desk into the studio machines to get things

12:44.720 --> 12:48.460
going and I rust tested into the Reaper machine where we used to record and I

12:48.460 --> 12:52.640
could manage the mixer through some software I had X it's called the x32

12:52.640 --> 12:57.240
edit software so I had that up and I'm working on things I'm trying to figure

12:57.240 --> 13:00.600
out what's going on with our cell phone studies or something wrong on the mixers

13:00.600 --> 13:04.800
or some levels that are off and I launched the app and I import the

13:04.800 --> 13:09.040
settings from the mixer and as it's loading the entire machine locks up and

13:09.040 --> 13:12.160
I dropped my remote connection one of the most vital machines in the entire

13:12.160 --> 13:17.360
recording chain it locks up and I lost communication with it for for like a

13:17.360 --> 13:20.720
week I just until West was able to get up here and actually a kick it for me

13:20.720 --> 13:25.120
and that really hobbled our remote production that started a whole set

13:25.120 --> 13:29.200
series of series on series on works arounds like work around on top of work

13:29.200 --> 13:33.640
around well and I meant you had to kind of change your expectations and the gear

13:33.640 --> 13:37.120
that you were using in the RV as well yeah like you you kind of struggled with

13:37.120 --> 13:40.040
having to reorganize oh yeah I had to kind of because we had to work around

13:40.040 --> 13:43.160
the machine where we brought in the audio the machine was responsible for

13:43.160 --> 13:46.400
bringing a remote audio I had to completely bypass it remotely it meant

13:46.400 --> 13:49.920
we couldn't do self-hosted live we just all these things that we had to sort out

13:49.920 --> 13:54.600
and then it really was a knock-on effect from there there in attempting to build

13:54.600 --> 13:59.360
all the workarounds to fix that other things broke ironically you know coder

13:59.360 --> 14:02.720
always went pretty well like I always coder managed to go fine for the most

14:02.720 --> 14:08.120
part did them all live even didn't have to do one of them off there land went

14:08.120 --> 14:13.640
fine well I see a pattern here every time I'm in the room there's something

14:13.640 --> 14:18.820
to that and then we had other issues an app updated that we didn't realize it

14:18.820 --> 14:24.120
updated and it no longer let you set the in and out audio interfaces oh I forgot

14:24.120 --> 14:27.640
about that that was just random another issue was at one point one of the

14:27.640 --> 14:31.080
services we use for VoIP like one of the backup ones that we go to when we're

14:31.080 --> 14:34.200
having problems they were having their own outage and at first we weren't sure

14:34.200 --> 14:36.720
if it was us or them like that kind of stuff was happening while we were trying

14:36.720 --> 14:43.840
to record and then we had the absolute hardest Linux unplugged ever where after

14:43.840 --> 14:49.200
the Pasadena meetup in the JPL tour West flew back home to fix the studio and he

14:49.200 --> 14:52.920
got everything up and running you and I connected in from the RV back it's we

14:52.920 --> 14:57.960
were in Sacramento at that point and I'm thinking this is gonna be easy it seemed

14:57.960 --> 15:01.200
like everything was this is the one yeah finally we're gonna have an easy one

15:01.200 --> 15:05.800
West is in studio he can fix the crash machine he can run the board we've got

15:05.800 --> 15:10.240
Ethernet from Jeff you know he's hooked us up with power we're comfortable we've

15:10.240 --> 15:14.680
got power we've got solid internet we've got West back at the HQ running the

15:14.680 --> 15:21.200
board this is gonna be the easy one and whatever whatever that was so wrong

15:21.200 --> 15:24.200
because we ended up having these horrible echo issues between each other

15:24.200 --> 15:29.360
that is still sometimes in here we have to solve and again I actually believe we

15:29.360 --> 15:33.120
thought it was at the RV because that seemed the most logical place for it to

15:33.120 --> 15:37.760
be happening but now I'm actually suspecting it's here in the studio well

15:37.760 --> 15:41.480
you ran into it yesterday morning with coder and I had to switch to a back of

15:41.480 --> 15:45.760
body interface and that's what the second thing in the studio that seems

15:45.760 --> 15:49.640
like a mystery that we've never run into before that yeah the studio setup hadn't

15:49.640 --> 15:54.800
really changed no no no we'll have to trace that one down I think yeah so

15:54.800 --> 15:59.040
that's a lot of fun and we have three machines in here that were built around

15:59.040 --> 16:05.600
2017 2018 and they're just getting old and they run what 24-7 and the reason

16:05.600 --> 16:09.520
for that is because when I when I did turn them on and off the failure rate

16:09.520 --> 16:15.360
was even higher so and you know like things change so yeah it's sort of like

16:15.360 --> 16:18.240
one of those problems that we're gonna have to sort out in part with some new

16:18.240 --> 16:22.400
hardware but also just like recheck our audio chain and work through all that

16:22.400 --> 16:27.800
but I think what I decided is no more just we've never nailed it you know like

16:27.800 --> 16:30.840
I thought this was the road trip we were gonna nail it and it was gonna be a by

16:30.840 --> 16:34.040
the numbers road trip we're going up and down i-5 should be simple we're not

16:34.040 --> 16:37.360
going any further than Sacramento we're gonna have solid Ethernet setup we're

16:37.360 --> 16:41.480
gonna have power this is gonna be the easy one in fact maybe I picked one that

16:41.480 --> 16:44.680
was too easy it was actually what I was thinking before the road trip crazy man

16:44.680 --> 16:48.680
I know and now afterwards I'm like I'm never doing that again and I'm gonna

16:48.680 --> 16:53.040
rethink how we do remote shows and I think what I want to do instead is I

16:53.040 --> 16:58.520
want to switch to doing shows at venues where ideally we'd have a low ticket

16:58.520 --> 17:01.720
price that just enough to cover our operational costs to get us out there

17:01.720 --> 17:05.400
and do the show and cover hotel or whatever we'd have to do or gas if I

17:05.400 --> 17:10.600
drive it and we just do shows at venues that would you know let some lousy

17:10.600 --> 17:14.360
podcasters in and then afterwards we do the meet-and-greet we do the food and

17:14.360 --> 17:18.600
drink but everybody gets a chance to talk to us if they want we walk away

17:18.600 --> 17:23.080
with show content that's been produced and then we because what we do right now

17:23.080 --> 17:29.600
is the exact frickin opposite we travel we spend days traveling we set up a

17:29.600 --> 17:33.280
meetup we meet up with somewhere between 30 and 100 people maybe if we're lucky

17:33.280 --> 17:38.400
200 people and then we you know we go all out we party for like five hours with

17:38.400 --> 17:44.220
these with these folks then we go home exhausted probably hungover and then we

17:44.220 --> 17:48.400
have to do a show the next day and it's like well what we just we just did all

17:48.400 --> 17:52.120
the traveling we just did all the meetup stuff we just spent five hours doing

17:52.120 --> 17:56.880
stuff and we don't have a show and by the way when did we work on the show

17:56.880 --> 18:01.440
it's crazy right and so we are we're constantly running full speed because we

18:01.440 --> 18:04.200
know this enough that we know like okay we need to be working on a show we got

18:04.200 --> 18:06.680
so we're working on meetups working on shows we're doing travel days we're

18:06.680 --> 18:10.160
doing it all together and it's just crazy when instead we could go to a

18:10.160 --> 18:14.640
venue we could have the meetup we could produce a show we could have an easy way

18:14.640 --> 18:17.560
to meet and greet so everybody who comes out as an opportunity to say hi

18:17.560 --> 18:21.280
because sometimes people travel for like 25 hours and don't even get a chance to

18:21.280 --> 18:23.800
say hi because it's just kind of a you know everybody's just hanging out

18:23.800 --> 18:29.440
chatting I don't know I haven't fully figured it out yet I think in part we

18:29.440 --> 18:33.920
were doing this because there were no events there was no Linux fest for us

18:33.920 --> 18:37.640
to go to right well I feel like when we did in Denver that was like the very

18:37.640 --> 18:42.200
beginning of any events happening yeah and is probably partly responsible for

18:42.200 --> 18:46.560
the great amazing turnouts that we had as well and it felt like back then that

18:46.560 --> 18:50.560
was exactly the thing to do yeah and okay we struggled and then actually the

18:50.560 --> 18:53.600
funny thing is everything we struggled with on that trip we salt on this trip

18:53.600 --> 18:58.160
and never had issues with internet etc yeah yeah I know we solve it and there's

18:58.160 --> 19:02.040
a whole new set of problems every trip mm-hmm and and we did pre-records as

19:02.040 --> 19:08.480
well right and even then so yeah I feel like another advantage to doing this

19:08.480 --> 19:13.240
idea that you have of doing live on the road shows is that actually as a fan

19:13.240 --> 19:16.800
it's really fun to see the production happening I know we have peer tube

19:16.800 --> 19:21.000
Jupiter tube and that's kind of neat but to see it in person and to see all the

19:21.000 --> 19:24.760
moving parts and stuff is actually part of the attraction and so we've had

19:24.760 --> 19:29.800
listeners want to you know come to the studio and or even be in jupes when we're

19:29.800 --> 19:32.880
doing some recordings and that's just sometimes not possible right with the

19:32.880 --> 19:36.700
how much we're juggling so I think actually doing a live show since sounds

19:36.700 --> 19:39.720
like a lot of fun from both angles from I hadn't thought about that listeners

19:39.720 --> 19:43.560
yeah it is kind of a behind-the-scenes thing too isn't it and I imagine now I

19:43.560 --> 19:49.800
hope going into 2023 I hope that more of our community events are back and those

19:49.800 --> 19:53.800
might be possible venues we could do shows at as well and so we don't really

19:53.800 --> 19:58.160
need to be creating the venue in the show and the event so much maybe now and

19:58.160 --> 20:01.320
instead we can kind of go to ones that are being organized by the community or

20:01.320 --> 20:05.880
maybe people in our community in our audience know of venues in their area

20:05.880 --> 20:09.640
that would be amenable to some lousy podcasters coming in there and talking

20:09.640 --> 20:15.440
about geeky Linux stuff and then maybe you know we put together is some sort

20:15.440 --> 20:18.920
of new formula we come up with for getting out there and seeing people and

20:18.920 --> 20:22.680
doing shows on the road and keeping it interesting for us helping us reconnect

20:22.680 --> 20:26.240
with the audience which keeps us grounded and also keeps us energized

20:26.240 --> 20:29.680
without having to kill ourselves on these road trips and then you know for

20:29.680 --> 20:34.880
me personally too it just puts a ton of wear and tear on my RV that I pay for

20:34.880 --> 20:38.880
out-of-pocket personally for years because you know you damaged something

20:38.880 --> 20:43.480
on one road trip and it breaks six months later you know who pays for that

20:43.480 --> 20:48.840
I do right and so there's an element of that as well it's like well do I really

20:48.840 --> 20:52.940
want to put all this wear and tear on my personal home for for this when you know

20:52.940 --> 20:56.680
maybe there's a smarter way to do it I personally prefer to travel that way you

20:56.680 --> 21:00.120
know I prefer to have my workspace I prefer to have my bed my bathroom I've

21:00.120 --> 21:04.000
heard from listeners who have worked in hotels and I have heard some awful horror

21:04.000 --> 21:08.200
stories about hotels and it makes me never want to stay in the hotel so we'll

21:08.200 --> 21:12.200
see but you know sometimes it does seem like it would be a better way to go and

21:12.200 --> 21:16.320
I think we should be careful like I don't want this whole conversation to

21:16.320 --> 21:24.440
feel Debian Downer or anything because actually we had an amazing time at

21:24.440 --> 21:28.920
every meetup that we went to and occasionally you know the morning of

21:28.920 --> 21:34.360
or like oh we're so kind of beat that you know do we really feel like doing a

21:34.360 --> 21:37.600
meetup right now but then we get there and it was like that was the best part

21:37.600 --> 21:41.800
of the trip for me oh yeah every meetup was absolutely great and like way out

21:41.800 --> 21:45.400
did expectations and everybody's amazing and and like you're drinking out of a

21:45.400 --> 21:50.040
cup that everybody's signed right now just as a memory and I go in here too

21:50.040 --> 21:55.440
yeah that's just been amazing it really it was it was really great and honestly

21:55.440 --> 21:59.880
like by the time we got to Portland I was ready to quit podcasting I was ready

21:59.880 --> 22:05.480
to quit RV and I was ready to just quit I was done and and the and the drive

22:05.480 --> 22:12.040
through Portland was brutally grindy it was just horrible traffic and then the

22:12.040 --> 22:17.280
meetup just flipped it all around for me yeah and so I I feel like yeah the

22:17.280 --> 22:21.080
meetups are totally worth it we ran into a heck of a lot of trouble in other

22:21.080 --> 22:24.640
areas having to do with the shows that we do every week which is hilarious and

22:24.640 --> 22:29.440
lady jupes was fine too which is yeah thing we had zero mechanical issues in

22:29.440 --> 22:33.520
either vehicles because we also took a chase car no car problems no jupes

22:33.520 --> 22:39.840
problems jupes executed and functioned 100% and no like near accidents I

22:39.840 --> 22:44.280
remember last year we had a close call and so from that perspective like a lot

22:44.280 --> 22:48.280
of stuff worked but the stuff that didn't work just sometimes shadowed some

22:48.280 --> 22:52.200
of her our emotions yeah the whole trip well and there's I think there's an

22:52.200 --> 22:55.880
element to like I mean this sounds weird but if you get an accident there's

22:55.880 --> 22:59.360
almost this like well what can you do what could you do well I've been there

22:59.360 --> 23:03.040
done that right it's like it really sucks especially when it's your home but

23:03.040 --> 23:08.880
like what can you do but when you have technical failures and gear failures and

23:08.880 --> 23:13.880
application failures it feels like well we could have prevented that did it eat

23:13.880 --> 23:16.760
at you in a way like that while it was happening like shit I should have did

23:16.760 --> 23:21.440
better or because I feel like partly with all the software updates and like

23:21.440 --> 23:26.400
random things I definitely wish we could have tested more I think what really was

23:26.400 --> 23:31.280
rough about it just from like a psychological standpoint was a lot of

23:31.280 --> 23:37.320
the technical issues struck after we were already live so then it's like okay

23:37.320 --> 23:42.680
you're live you don't want to leave dead air but you also are trying to visualize

23:42.680 --> 23:46.520
a virtual studio because the RV is a virtual studio you've got to visualize

23:46.520 --> 23:52.120
the entire wiring of a mixer in a virtual studio in your head and then

23:52.120 --> 23:56.460
also because I'm not here in this studio I also need to visualize the entire in

23:56.460 --> 24:00.840
and out layout of this studio how it all works where in that layout this problem

24:00.840 --> 24:06.400
could potentially be keep all of that state in my head troubleshoot it while

24:06.400 --> 24:09.840
also trying to like play music or chat with the chat room or just keep

24:09.840 --> 24:13.080
conversation going which is great when you or Wes are there and you can help

24:13.080 --> 24:16.800
with that but and then also there's just this pressure of well the longer this is

24:16.800 --> 24:21.760
a problem the longer people have to wait and that gets that gets to be kind of

24:21.760 --> 24:25.800
old I have to say and when it's every single live stream for two weeks in a

24:25.800 --> 24:30.680
row you start to get like god I'm just sick and tired of doing this you know if

24:30.680 --> 24:34.200
you were maybe in the metaverse you could trace your trace your lines on

24:34.200 --> 24:39.200
your virtual mixer there I think the other thing that wasn't related to show

24:39.200 --> 24:45.240
production but did kind of tilt things towards like this has been an awful road

24:45.240 --> 24:49.400
trip it was an awful road trip punctuated with a lot of great stuff

24:49.400 --> 24:56.280
like Jeff and his setup and his hospitality and Brittany's hospitality

24:56.280 --> 25:03.080
was just absolutely legendary easily the meetups were just incredible

25:03.080 --> 25:09.560
rejuvenating motivating and then JPL the tour of JPL was something I'll remember

25:09.560 --> 25:12.480
for the rest of my life and would like to go back every few years and do again

25:12.480 --> 25:17.080
right so like hard road trip punctuated with a lot of greatness here and there

25:17.080 --> 25:21.440
and so it's a weird mix but one thing I think that tilted it for me towards the

25:21.440 --> 25:27.040
negative and it's still an issue today is my home server that runs the heating

25:27.040 --> 25:32.880
the lighting the security system the camera system and parts of you know the

25:32.880 --> 25:39.800
network it died and man was that bad timing just a really bad time when did

25:39.800 --> 25:45.040
it die and oh I know when it died oh yeah oh well it died while we were in

25:45.040 --> 25:49.280
Pasadena at the chorus at the Airbnb everything was dying where we weren't

25:49.280 --> 25:54.400
yeah you're right it was remote failures every single time and it was just one

25:54.400 --> 25:58.880
evening at the at the Airbnb I wasn't able to get pull up home assistant check

25:58.880 --> 26:04.400
on jupes anymore and then my backup recovery strategy my date is fine but I

26:04.400 --> 26:09.200
had like this pie I could swap in that didn't work you know cuz I never tested

26:09.200 --> 26:16.480
that great idea bad execution and so this was weeks ago now two weeks ago

26:16.480 --> 26:21.760
that this died and we still haven't had five minutes to plug an HDMI monitor in

26:21.760 --> 26:25.720
and see what's wrong with that pie well and to make it worse we had to tear out

26:25.720 --> 26:29.800
the entire setup out of your RV yesterday yeah before we even got a

26:29.800 --> 26:33.400
chance to troubleshoot it we ripped it all out because I'm finally getting my

26:33.400 --> 26:39.220
living room slide fixed and they are completely taking apart the entire slide

26:39.220 --> 26:44.560
because they're removing the floor it's crazy and so the server had to come out

26:44.560 --> 26:49.240
they're taking like one of the four walls out of your home yeah and then

26:49.240 --> 26:54.100
rebuilding one of the floors in our living room and so the pie had to come

26:54.100 --> 26:58.200
out and so we have it here in a box but I'm just gonna rebuild it my home

26:58.200 --> 27:02.360
assistant yellow came in and I've got an idea I'm honestly I'm really tempted to

27:02.360 --> 27:08.280
get a NUC maybe like an i5 or an i3 NUC with maybe 16 gigs of RAM something

27:08.280 --> 27:12.880
that supports quicksync you get the right NUC and they only pull under load

27:12.880 --> 27:17.320
like 15 watts yeah I think we we did touch on this in the last self hosted

27:17.320 --> 27:20.680
if you want to hear more about it right yep and I think I'm gonna get one with

27:20.680 --> 27:25.800
thunderbolt I think is the way to go with that we'll see we shall see but I

27:25.800 --> 27:28.320
want to take a moment and I want to thank Linode for making the road trip

27:28.320 --> 27:32.400
possible for supporting us for just being crazy like that and investing in

27:32.400 --> 27:36.960
community Linode comm slash Jupiter go there to get $100 in credit for a 60 day

27:36.960 --> 27:41.740
account for 60 days on a new account and go there to support the show also if

27:41.740 --> 27:45.880
you're learning Linode has a lot of really great resources this is an area I

27:45.880 --> 27:48.680
don't focus on a lot in the other shows but it's something I think maybe I'd

27:48.680 --> 27:54.280
like to let you guys know about if you're curious about Kubernetes or

27:54.280 --> 27:56.960
learning just things like infrastructures code in general maybe

27:56.960 --> 28:03.120
terraform ansible puppet chef or salt they have an infrastructure as code

28:03.120 --> 28:08.600
ebook series it's about 200 pages each tools covered as a standalone project

28:08.600 --> 28:12.800
you learn a little bit about them you get a little kind of overview on how to

28:12.800 --> 28:17.640
work it all with Docker and how to use github and work with all of these tools

28:17.640 --> 28:20.760
it's free I don't even think you I don't even think you have to give me your

28:20.760 --> 28:24.080
email address let me go look I don't even think Linode asked for your email

28:24.080 --> 28:27.800
address I think they just let you download the ebook yep instant download

28:27.800 --> 28:32.320
13 megs you don't have to give me your email address and then you get a great

28:32.320 --> 28:37.800
great walkthrough on this stuff they have so much documentation over here

28:37.800 --> 28:44.480
learn k8 slabs cloud simplified there's all kinds of stuff over including video

28:44.480 --> 28:49.120
series to Linux beginner video series they also have one-click deployments so

28:49.120 --> 28:53.760
if you've never really deployed a server before it's so easy and they make it

28:53.760 --> 28:57.280
they've just updated their marketplace UI to make it super clear what's new

28:57.280 --> 29:01.480
what's hot let's go try that and if you want to do something like a little more

29:01.480 --> 29:05.400
advanced well you can go crazy like we did they'll give you documentation on

29:05.400 --> 29:08.960
how to build it up from the metal we've got a Nix box running on Linode and I

29:08.960 --> 29:15.920
have this crazy VPN conglomerate box that's made by a pep wave for my mobile

29:15.920 --> 29:20.720
router and it's their own custom Linux distro and Linode makes it possible for

29:20.720 --> 29:25.000
me to even load that and then they have s3 object storage they have a fantastic

29:25.000 --> 29:30.280
interface an API for days that makes it really easy to integrate take snapshots

29:30.280 --> 29:35.120
use a command-line tool go see why over a million customers worldwide love Linode

29:35.120 --> 29:37.640
some of my friends have been using it for a decade I've been using it for

29:37.640 --> 29:41.120
nearly three years and they have some of the best performance and some of the

29:41.120 --> 29:45.560
best pricing Linode comm slash Jupiter that's where you go to get $100 and 60

29:45.560 --> 29:49.280
day credit on a new account and it's a great way to support the show Linode

29:49.280 --> 29:54.960
comm slash Jupiter and I will put a link to that infrastructure as code ebook in

29:54.960 --> 30:01.680
the show notes in the nizzles so that way you can go grab that and you can

30:01.680 --> 30:06.080
learn a Kate yourself on that that's some good stuff right there you know

30:06.080 --> 30:09.160
about learning Kate and Brent I'm starting to learn a Kate about it hey

30:09.160 --> 30:13.940
what have we learned a Kate about our website because while you and I were on

30:13.940 --> 30:20.960
the road work continued on and the community has just been really really

30:20.960 --> 30:25.120
sticking with it and producing some really great features some great fixes

30:25.120 --> 30:28.680
and nice tidying up I mean there's a lot we could talk about here so where do you

30:28.680 --> 30:33.360
want to go what do you want to focus on today yeah I feel like it's been a big

30:33.360 --> 30:40.520
week both because I've been away from the website work in a way that first I

30:40.520 --> 30:43.600
was really worried about and we touched on this in the last office hours but

30:43.600 --> 30:47.480
actually now that I'm having the chance to reflect on it I feel is actually a

30:47.480 --> 30:51.780
huge success story oh okay hold on zoom in on that for a second zoom in and

30:51.780 --> 30:56.580
hands on that Brantley mm-hmm so I was worried that maybe the momentum would

30:56.580 --> 31:02.680
kind of start to slow because I've been in there you know let's say helping

31:02.680 --> 31:06.520
people accomplish amazing things I'm not the one doing the amazing things I'm

31:06.520 --> 31:11.800
just kind of nudging and so it's kind of worried that us being on the road meant

31:11.800 --> 31:15.440
that I could spend less time doing that and that would mean people would be less

31:15.440 --> 31:19.320
excited about contributing but actually it's been the total opposite the

31:19.320 --> 31:27.480
community even gave me or trying to test PRS while sitting in the front of lady

31:27.480 --> 31:32.880
jeeps bouncing around the i5 because they're like you you're busy on the road

31:32.880 --> 31:37.880
like let's do this when you get back about working on the website while going

31:37.880 --> 31:41.400
down the road right right well that was my only opportunity to really check in

31:41.400 --> 31:46.440
and you've got a pretty nice work area there but it's it's very tricky as

31:46.440 --> 31:52.920
things are jumping and bouncing around but so I feel like a thank you for

31:52.920 --> 31:56.520
taking care of me everyone while I was on the trip and making sure I'm a little

31:56.520 --> 32:00.960
bit more sane and not trying to push myself too hard but also just for taking

32:00.960 --> 32:06.960
the helm while I was gone and I promoted CG bass player this week to having some

32:06.960 --> 32:13.160
access to do some triage and things like that congratulations space player yeah

32:13.160 --> 32:18.120
they've been amazing at submitting some pretty great PRS in the last I don't know

32:18.120 --> 32:22.880
a month or two even and I just thought geez there's some great people who I've

32:22.880 --> 32:27.200
built a lot of trust with and they've been just helping organize everything

32:27.200 --> 32:32.560
along with everyone else who's already been doing that so thank you for making

32:32.560 --> 32:36.200
my job a little bit easier but what that's also meant is that there's some

32:36.200 --> 32:41.880
really amazing PRS that have come in in the last week and they aren't quite I

32:41.880 --> 32:46.960
would say they're not quite merged yet I was struggling this morning cuz I was

32:46.960 --> 32:51.240
like we got to get these merge office hours creates a deadline you're right

32:51.240 --> 32:55.520
Elray helped me walk off the ledge there because actually we don't want to hurry

32:55.520 --> 32:59.320
PRS to true to talk about them what we want is actually great PRS and what's

32:59.320 --> 33:03.240
happening is that one of them in specific is to automate the sponsors

33:03.240 --> 33:08.100
page I made a sponsors page back in I don't know a month or two ago when we

33:08.100 --> 33:12.840
were first going live because I thought well a good function is to be able to go

33:12.840 --> 33:16.080
to our website when you're trying to sign up for you know Linode or something

33:16.080 --> 33:19.400
like that and to get the URL we mentioned them in the shows all the time

33:19.400 --> 33:23.400
and you can go to the show notes and sometimes get them but that's not always

33:23.400 --> 33:27.040
true and having them all in one place one right right and if you also think

33:27.040 --> 33:31.040
about this website as a platform that other podcasters could adopt one day

33:31.040 --> 33:35.360
that's a feature other podcasters would want to that's a very good point so I

33:35.360 --> 33:42.920
was like a monkey creating this sponsors page just with text um you know I was

33:42.920 --> 33:47.080
copy and pasting right because I I don't know what I'm doing and that was good

33:47.080 --> 33:50.080
enough for version one our first milestone of the website when it went

33:50.080 --> 33:55.720
live and it looked fine but here's what I love is that I came around and I was

33:55.720 --> 33:59.560
like geez we haven't updated that updated that in a while and so I made a

33:59.560 --> 34:02.680
few updates you know we have some new sponsors or new links and descriptions

34:02.680 --> 34:07.160
and stuff like that so I threw them in there but just in my PR which was just

34:07.160 --> 34:12.560
text updated text I wrote we shouldn't do this like this again we should we

34:12.560 --> 34:17.200
should automate this we've been talking about automating it and sure enough the

34:17.200 --> 34:22.520
next day chance wrote up a PR to automate the whole thing and there's

34:22.520 --> 34:25.800
been a lot of discussions and like improvements and back and forth between

34:25.800 --> 34:31.760
community members on improving that initial PR and I think that's the real

34:31.760 --> 34:36.920
that's exactly what we want it's like not quick PRs to be submitted to the

34:36.920 --> 34:41.560
website to add functionality but this like constructive building of this

34:41.560 --> 34:46.760
amazing modular piece of technology that we're gonna throw at the website and

34:46.760 --> 34:51.920
then it'll be solid so I feel like it's maybe you know a day or two away from

34:51.920 --> 34:57.960
being merged into our production but it's still super exciting so I want to

34:57.960 --> 35:01.800
mention it that is a really cool thing you know people are looking at

35:01.800 --> 35:05.520
accessibility people caught some bad links for like my my referral to

35:05.520 --> 35:09.840
fountain there's just little things to big things right and it's stuff that we

35:09.840 --> 35:16.280
just as a team don't put a lot of focus on because just culturally we haven't

35:16.280 --> 35:20.680
really built that that muscle but we're bringing in what feels like a team of

35:20.680 --> 35:24.040
people who are thinking about those things that we don't catch little stuff

35:24.040 --> 35:26.160
that we just don't catch sometimes because we're moving on to the next

35:26.160 --> 35:29.400
thing all the time and I think that was your real insight in in wanting to make

35:29.400 --> 35:33.960
the website an open source project was that the listeners have a very

35:33.960 --> 35:39.280
different perspective of even just our website yeah and we do yeah and you know

35:39.280 --> 35:43.240
we don't I've been trying to use the website as much as possible to find

35:43.240 --> 35:47.000
those little errors in it but we don't always you know go to our own website to

35:47.000 --> 35:50.040
use it we have the back channels that create the content that make it to the

35:50.040 --> 35:53.720
website right and so the listeners have been amazing at catching those things

35:53.720 --> 35:58.760
like you mentioned yeah I love that part of it so we have more to talk about the

35:58.760 --> 36:02.560
website I think when we get to the boost but I did know that there is a JB and a

36:02.560 --> 36:07.800
hacktoberfest thread tell us a little bit about that good catch I heard a

36:07.800 --> 36:12.920
bunch of listeners in the last I would say three weeks suggest that we should

36:12.920 --> 36:16.640
participate in hacktoberfest now you and I were on the road and I was like oh

36:16.640 --> 36:20.920
that sounds interesting I actually am not that familiar with it so I'll have

36:20.920 --> 36:25.120
to add that to the queue of things I need to look into but it came up over

36:25.120 --> 36:28.160
and over and over and Reese was kind enough to write an issue about it and

36:28.160 --> 36:31.800
said hey we should just do this here's how you do it it's pretty easy so it

36:31.800 --> 36:34.920
turns out Chris have you heard of hacktoberfest before I think I'm

36:34.920 --> 36:38.200
familiar with at least what it used to be I'm not sure if I'm familiar with its

36:38.200 --> 36:43.520
current iteration but I think it's a digital ocean originated idea but kind

36:43.520 --> 36:48.560
of is just kind of the I think the idea is to encourage people to participate in

36:48.560 --> 36:52.400
open source and there's a way you can kind of show that you've done that and

36:52.400 --> 36:56.280
you then can get some stuff from them or you could get some stuff from them

36:56.280 --> 36:59.600
that's about as much as I remember how am I doing I think you're doing great

36:59.600 --> 37:03.920
okay yeah that's the whole that's the whole the pitch right there I think you

37:03.920 --> 37:10.040
hit it you nailed it it is a digital ocean okay initiative and it turns out

37:10.040 --> 37:13.780
it's been happening for nine years yeah that really caught me and their website

37:13.780 --> 37:18.200
is actually super fun to browse and has a bit of that you know digital ocean

37:18.200 --> 37:23.000
playfulness that we've seen from time to time now they've taken the spam issues

37:23.000 --> 37:26.440
seriously I think that's probably what people if they have any kind of negative

37:26.440 --> 37:29.840
association with hacktoberfest it's probably that there was a period of time

37:29.840 --> 37:33.400
where it seemed to be like just generating random spam contributions

37:33.400 --> 37:36.760
just so you could enter into the hacktoberfest drawings or whatever they

37:36.760 --> 37:40.680
are but I think that they've addressed that with some of their measures yes so

37:40.680 --> 37:44.960
the idea with hacktoberfest for us at least in this project which is focusing

37:44.960 --> 37:50.980
on our website is to maybe push us to work a little bit harder to get some

37:50.980 --> 37:55.840
contributions in for those who have been maybe thinking of participating but

37:55.840 --> 38:00.560
haven't quite jumped in that's a great time but for us on the maintainership

38:00.560 --> 38:05.160
side is just to look at our you know hundred-plus issues that we have and to

38:05.160 --> 38:10.920
sort them in a way that maybe are easier to solve some of them are pretty

38:10.920 --> 38:14.440
nebulous in their description so I've been going through and trying to make

38:14.440 --> 38:18.320
them a little bit more well-defined so that someone can say okay I'm gonna work

38:18.320 --> 38:22.200
on this issue and it's very well-defined I just need to walk through the steps so

38:22.200 --> 38:27.740
I've been working a little bit on housekeeping shall we say and so if you

38:27.740 --> 38:30.720
are thinking of participating there's a few steps and it's actually really easy

38:30.720 --> 38:34.840
so you just need to register hacktoberfest isn't calm Chris can you

38:34.840 --> 38:40.160
check that for me it is hacktoberfest calm so you just need to register any

38:40.160 --> 38:45.640
time before October 31 make some pull requests or our project or any other

38:45.640 --> 38:52.600
hacktoberfest linked topic on github or gitlab as well and have one of your PR

38:52.600 --> 38:58.280
actually it's four of your PRs merged oh okay so it's kind of like a sign of

38:58.280 --> 39:01.640
success I guess I see and they need to be tagged as well with hacktoberfest yeah

39:01.640 --> 39:06.720
so that's where I come in is I've been I created some tags hacktoberfest tag and

39:06.720 --> 39:11.120
there also needs to be a hacktoberfest dash accepted tag so I'm going to be

39:11.120 --> 39:15.400
pretty diligent on trying to make sure that those who are participating get the

39:15.400 --> 39:18.920
right tags that they can you know get the recognition for their work I mean I

39:18.920 --> 39:23.760
think what I like about this is the range is pretty pretty wide like if you

39:23.760 --> 39:28.460
don't really have a lot of skills we have some issues that are like fix a bad

39:28.460 --> 39:32.560
URL yeah you know how to make a right good URL you could probably do things

39:32.560 --> 39:37.880
okay and I think that's the real benefit here is that there's a ton of different

39:37.880 --> 39:44.880
ways to contribute and so if you don't know how Hugo works like me then there

39:44.880 --> 39:47.560
are a bunch of different ways you can help us out and I've been trying to use

39:47.560 --> 39:50.680
issues as a way of tracking those different tasks some of them are just

39:50.680 --> 39:54.200
like hey we need these links to be external links and here's how you do it

39:54.200 --> 39:58.120
we just don't have time to do it so if someone wants to just sit down for an

39:58.120 --> 40:04.320
hour and do that or even less so we will link to our hacktoberfest tagged issues

40:04.320 --> 40:09.200
I think I have maybe at least a good handful I spent late last night while we

40:09.200 --> 40:15.360
were walking watching Rick and Marty out of this this cup here the signed cup

40:15.360 --> 40:20.360
from our Portland nice about that meetup meetup cup right on the one little bit

40:20.360 --> 40:23.680
of wine a little bit of website work a little bit of Rick and Morty it was fun

40:23.680 --> 40:29.000
and so I did tag a bunch of them I will keep trying to add more and if any

40:29.000 --> 40:35.000
listeners have other ideas for topics that can be solved in this hacktoberfest

40:35.000 --> 40:40.840
what would you call a window of time well yeah we will try hard to push to

40:40.840 --> 40:43.400
make a lot of contributions in this time so if you want to participate it's

40:43.400 --> 40:47.320
actually pretty easy we've got some links to doing that and we'd love to get

40:47.320 --> 40:51.400
you to participate so thank you yeah the period of festing is now you must

40:51.400 --> 40:55.760
participate during the fest window and before we completely move off the

40:55.760 --> 41:00.080
website I just I noted that you had a couple of notable PRS in here and one

41:00.080 --> 41:07.040
from Elry about deploying previews this is such a great example of how amazing

41:07.040 --> 41:10.040
our community is like when you hear us talking about this and you're like what

41:10.040 --> 41:13.880
are these guys really tangibly talking about we'll put a link to this PR

41:13.880 --> 41:19.640
request number 456 in the show notes just so you can see just how incredible

41:19.640 --> 41:24.040
this conversation is and the people working on this are so so so great

41:24.040 --> 41:28.080
really I mean I feel like every week already just comes in with something

41:28.080 --> 41:33.280
really awesome I'm I feel like you know we've been saying thank you Elray for

41:33.280 --> 41:37.840
weeks now on the show and unfortunately we have to say it again thank you Elray

41:37.840 --> 41:43.920
Elray Elray you said Elry earlier I did I it's it's actually Alex so thanks

41:43.920 --> 41:48.200
Alex yeah Alex we could do that or we could do biggie you know the biggie the

41:48.200 --> 41:51.080
big L I think you're on to something yeah cuz I mean otherwise we get Alex

41:51.080 --> 41:55.440
infused with Alex that's just it right I don't do that mm-hmm yeah mm-hmm so

41:55.440 --> 41:59.800
thanks biggie we appreciate your biggie energy and we'll have a link to that

41:59.800 --> 42:04.760
just that's a great example but some of our first boosts well not our very first

42:04.760 --> 42:07.800
but some of our boosts are actually about the website ask not what your

42:07.800 --> 42:14.160
podcast can boost for you but what you can boost for your podcast oh we got a

42:14.160 --> 42:17.400
we got a big boost a couple of big boosts coming you know what actually I'm

42:17.400 --> 42:21.800
gonna stop right here stop the show for a second you know and just say we got

42:21.800 --> 42:26.400
some remarkable audience support via the boost and what you'll see is there's a

42:26.400 --> 42:29.440
few core members of our audience who really are stepping up and supporting

42:29.440 --> 42:33.520
office hours I'm blown away by some of that this week so let's start with

42:33.520 --> 42:38.440
optimus gray who sent in a row of grandpa ducks twenty two thousand two

42:38.440 --> 42:44.200
hundred and twenty two sad things are looking up but all but duck so I love

42:44.200 --> 42:50.480
this so optimus drove for like 24 hours each way to come to the JPL tour crazy

42:50.480 --> 42:56.480
and also made it to the Pasadena meetup mm-hmm and so on his way back on his

42:56.480 --> 43:01.680
drive home we got a series of boosts some ideas this is my first stop on the

43:01.680 --> 43:05.920
way home from the Southern California meetup with Brent making fun of me and

43:05.920 --> 43:12.120
rightly so I now have a list of favorite JB members they are Wes Alex Mike Chris

43:12.120 --> 43:15.080
Wow these are in order of importance he's

43:15.080 --> 43:24.320
bacon drew yeah his meow not mine jar jar Joe Hayden Levi and then Brent Wow

43:24.320 --> 43:29.040
at the end Brent can only move back up the list if he works on a toy drinking

43:29.040 --> 43:34.200
bird that can continue to touch Alex's chair over and over again I think that

43:34.200 --> 43:38.440
sounds like it's worth doing Wow wonderful reference there also perhaps

43:38.440 --> 43:41.840
the California State Border Patrol asked you about fruit and vegetables because

43:41.840 --> 43:45.640
you had a Canadian with you hey now I had no problems coming from Nevada I

43:45.640 --> 43:50.400
have always been asked at the border if I have fruit and veggies or produce or

43:50.400 --> 43:53.560
whatever it's always been a thing they've always done that and I always

43:53.560 --> 43:59.280
think is that just like pretext for stopping me are they really they set up

43:59.280 --> 44:02.720
these all these border crossings at the state border just to stop every single

44:02.720 --> 44:06.040
person and ask them if they got fruit in their car it's just the weirdest thing

44:06.040 --> 44:09.520
they don't grow things in the panel oh that could be there's no way you could

44:09.520 --> 44:13.760
be bringing any fruit or produce because Nevada ain't got nothing let's see Wow

44:13.760 --> 44:17.680
look at you coming in with the shade jizzing optimist Greg comes in with a

44:17.680 --> 44:21.720
double grandpa duck boost thank you kindly okay maybe I was trolling Alex

44:21.720 --> 44:25.920
Brent and Chris too much in my last boost sorry Wes but maybe next time I'll

44:25.920 --> 44:30.040
troll you how I do like the ideas who's giving us a show name because this is

44:30.040 --> 44:33.200
something we need to we need to figure out another back from the road trip I do

44:33.200 --> 44:37.920
like the name chat or sats for a JB extra sub channel like a brunch with

44:37.920 --> 44:41.520
Brent I came up with four name replacements for office hours when I was

44:41.520 --> 44:46.280
driving home oh it's 29 hours not 24 hours I had a lot of time to think I'm

44:46.280 --> 44:49.920
gonna check those names in the podcast index on duck duck and on YouTube and

44:49.920 --> 44:53.920
I'll report back are you ready this is amazing

44:53.920 --> 44:59.560
optimus gray then comes in with a third boost boost with twenty thousand four

44:59.560 --> 45:04.800
hundred eighty sats here are the three show name ideas after visiting JPL you

45:04.800 --> 45:08.680
ready for these I think so I think we should write these down I feel like I

45:08.680 --> 45:10.920
don't want to lose track of these cuz we've got to come up with a new show

45:10.920 --> 45:15.480
name you got a pen over there Brent Lee's pulling out a pad of paper yeah I

45:15.480 --> 45:21.600
need a pen I got a I got a marker I see nothing in my alright you ready hmm so

45:21.600 --> 45:28.360
his first name suggestion is I of Jupiter interesting not bad right he

45:28.360 --> 45:33.640
says it's kind of like the idea is what's JB looking at looking for looking

45:33.640 --> 45:41.920
towards another one orbit of Jupiter uh-huh so if you picture like a bunch of

45:41.920 --> 45:45.720
ideas and things and projects floating around yeah what's going on around JB's

45:45.720 --> 45:51.800
kind of like a subtext his next one is IO which is a moon of Jupiter and of

45:51.800 --> 45:55.960
course input output which is kind of akin to like listener feedback and then

45:55.960 --> 46:01.120
output on the podcast so IO so both because it's a moon and because we do a

46:01.120 --> 46:05.960
lot of input output with the audience in this show you know I feel like that is

46:05.960 --> 46:11.720
my favorite one is short also yeah short is interesting I also unfortunately feel

46:11.720 --> 46:15.120
like it might be the hardest to look for which is the Brahma having right now

46:15.120 --> 46:20.100
yeah you could almost see like three three less than three letters might be

46:20.100 --> 46:23.200
really hard for a lot of searching I mean it could be like Jupiter IO yeah

46:23.200 --> 46:26.720
you know the only problem with that is in it with all of these really and it's

46:26.720 --> 46:29.400
my fault because I named the network this way oh Chris but doesn't it make

46:29.400 --> 46:33.000
you think of like it should be like a space podcast about Jupiter isn't that

46:33.000 --> 46:38.660
what we talked about I enjoyed the last meetup on this trip remember a good

46:38.660 --> 46:42.320
system crashes a good system crash means more content for podcasting I guess that

46:42.320 --> 46:46.840
is the upside system crash not 12 system crashes thank you thank you

46:46.840 --> 46:51.560
alright lurks a lot came in with a lot to share with elite set of stats office

46:51.560 --> 46:57.640
hours his new name needs to have a space theme like the network there you go so

46:57.640 --> 47:04.800
so Jupiter base is his suggestion Jupiter base we think of that I could

47:04.800 --> 47:09.120
live with base he also recommends Jupiter production lounge I'll play on

47:09.120 --> 47:13.680
JPL that's funny I could see that too I'm writing all these down guys I'm

47:13.680 --> 47:17.400
writing all these down I'm gonna look at these I'm gonna think on these after the

47:17.400 --> 47:20.760
show because I really do want to come up with a better name and something that's

47:20.760 --> 47:25.080
unique to the show I think and kind of fun he says also each location could

47:25.080 --> 47:29.160
have a spacey name so lady jupes could actually be called Jupiter station so

47:29.160 --> 47:32.640
you know you're coming to coming in from Jupiter station kind of like a ground

47:32.640 --> 47:38.360
control to major Brent just gonna have the right names to have fun and then

47:38.360 --> 47:44.600
lurks a lot comes in with a triple boo wow is it really a hundred and thirty

47:44.600 --> 47:52.280
three thousand seven hundred sats that's like a mega leet sat it may be a typo

47:53.640 --> 47:58.080
thank you to our community who has been sourcing the boost clips on our github

47:58.080 --> 48:02.360
so he wanted to comment on how we have fun with like the leet sats thing you

48:02.360 --> 48:07.880
know and he says for me the childish leet elitism and macho thing is all tongue

48:07.880 --> 48:12.320
in cheek it's just a fun sarcastic joke and a poke at my own imposter syndrome

48:12.320 --> 48:16.660
tendencies but it's fun to gamify these things as a form of self motivation so

48:16.660 --> 48:25.960
to that end achievement unlocked I have used boost CLI and done from my um bro

48:25.960 --> 48:32.480
you're doing a good job good job lurks a lot that's impressive man that is tell

48:32.480 --> 48:36.440
me lurks a lot isn't that sort of like the ultimate technical unlock

48:36.440 --> 48:39.240
achievement I mean it really does doesn't it feel good he says it's an

48:39.240 --> 48:42.760
achievement unlocked I agree I'm so proud of you that is man click building

48:42.760 --> 48:47.040
gentoo back in the day it is it is it's a lot like that if it has that same kind

48:47.040 --> 48:51.720
of thing you really learn how a lot of this works and much like when I did that

48:51.720 --> 48:56.520
with gentoo I gained a whole new respect like that was truly what got me to

48:56.520 --> 49:00.440
understand and appreciate Linux was building gentoo and arch systems and

49:00.440 --> 49:04.080
learning how it actually worked compared to Windows and then I learned such a

49:04.080 --> 49:07.280
deep respect and appreciation for that system and I feel like it's the same way

49:07.280 --> 49:11.320
when you do boost CLI in some ways I'm kind of envious of you lurks that's just

49:11.320 --> 49:14.880
such a fun place to be again so that's great and he came in get ready for this

49:14.880 --> 49:24.760
Brent are you ready for this I think so a quad boost from sir lurks a lot

49:24.760 --> 49:30.240
hundred and one three hundred and thirty seven sats thank you for so very many

49:30.240 --> 49:33.720
things over the years most recently I have been inspired by the Nixos

49:33.720 --> 49:39.200
challenge the world of podcasting 2.0 lightning and Bitcoin thanks for dog

49:39.200 --> 49:43.120
footing matrix and Hugo thank you for your faucet and self-hosting advocacy

49:43.120 --> 49:49.800
and especially for fostering a real sense of community stop it stop it geez

49:49.800 --> 49:54.480
that's too much thank you for the thank you for the support you know like we had

49:54.480 --> 49:57.400
some great support come in this week for this episode we really really do

49:57.400 --> 50:06.720
appreciate and Brent still on that split too true so you know we did we have

50:06.720 --> 50:11.920
talked about that on on love a little bit but that was fun with the the SAT

50:11.920 --> 50:18.880
stakes and the grocers the SATs the gas I mean honestly the better thing might

50:18.880 --> 50:21.760
be just as you know like if you could just convert the stats to cash but we

50:21.760 --> 50:24.600
didn't want to do that that was the easy way out so that's not fun enough bit

50:24.600 --> 50:30.200
refill lets you buy Texaco and Chevron gas cards which works as long as you're

50:30.200 --> 50:34.720
in the States but once you enter Scandinavia you guys you don't have those

50:34.720 --> 50:40.780
right no yeah no I wonder if there's like a shell like shell is is pretty

50:40.780 --> 50:44.400
common and you have them here so I wonder if they sell shell cards on bit

50:44.400 --> 50:47.080
refill oh we didn't look hard enough did we'll have to check we have to check

50:47.080 --> 50:54.280
then we got ten thousand sats from orange Fox who I think might actually be

50:54.280 --> 51:02.040
Alex Gates using breeze said the worst thing about the office TV fans is when

51:02.040 --> 51:07.200
they try to make Battlestar Galactica references without ever seen BSG I agree

51:07.200 --> 51:10.320
and this is this is the problem with the show name is everybody thinks it's an

51:10.320 --> 51:12.920
office podcast and then they're disappointed when they start listening

51:12.920 --> 51:16.920
and it's not an it's not an office podcast yeah it's not it's not about the

51:16.920 --> 51:24.080
TV show there are plenty oh my god there are plenty of those I never had any idea

51:24.080 --> 51:28.560
so okay we do definitely need a new name there's just no doubt about it we have

51:28.560 --> 51:32.920
another boost that came in from true grits with 1701 the enterprise sats

51:32.920 --> 51:37.960
so instead of making a side business off the new JB hosting platform maybe y'all

51:37.960 --> 51:43.640
should turn it into a Libre podcasting package interesting hmm and then gene

51:43.640 --> 51:47.760
bean was thinking along the same lines as another set of leet sats packaging

51:47.760 --> 51:52.120
the website bits up in a way other podcasters could consume while also being

51:52.120 --> 51:58.200
able to get updates would be awesome you know there's something to this I think

51:58.200 --> 52:04.800
there's something to creating a platform that other podcasters could package up

52:04.800 --> 52:08.760
and use and I don't know how far we take this but I'm down to experiment with

52:08.760 --> 52:11.840
taking it further especially if community members have ideas on how we

52:11.840 --> 52:15.360
could make it I guess more portable would be the word to use I know we need

52:15.360 --> 52:18.720
to have a good licensing conversation we need to sort all that stuff out but I

52:18.720 --> 52:21.680
think it's a direction we could take things especially once we think we have

52:21.680 --> 52:25.920
it in a pretty feature complete state and then maybe later on as we develop a

52:25.920 --> 52:30.040
way to generate RSS feeds that's something we could share too and

52:30.040 --> 52:34.280
ultimately and I think we have to remember the RSS feed is our radio

52:34.280 --> 52:38.800
signal that's our broadcast tower the website is an endpoint and so I think if

52:38.800 --> 52:44.520
we created the system that where the two work together somehow you know you put

52:44.520 --> 52:47.520
some of this information in the RSS feed and it automatically populates the

52:47.520 --> 52:52.960
website and the website is is also one of the end consumers of that RSS feed so

52:52.960 --> 52:55.120
the source of truth is there are assessed I think that'd be incredibly

52:55.120 --> 52:58.520
powerful really interesting and very useful for other podcasters because all

52:58.520 --> 53:02.720
then they would have to do is point that website consumption whatever it is

53:02.720 --> 53:06.520
endpoint at their RSS feed and it would just pull it in and begin to build their

53:06.520 --> 53:12.240
you know Hugo based website for them that'd be my idea you know that gets me

53:12.240 --> 53:16.800
thinking I was originally gonna say oh well we haven't really heard of others

53:16.800 --> 53:20.800
out there outside of the JB community really latching on to the project that

53:20.800 --> 53:24.280
we're building here but then that got me thinking well maybe we haven't described

53:24.280 --> 53:27.440
what it actually does well enough you know if you're right it's been

53:27.440 --> 53:32.040
described as a website for us well that's it what if you change what

53:32.040 --> 53:37.280
content it's looking at and you change out the logos I mean I wouldn't be a fan

53:37.280 --> 53:40.920
my main thing one of the main things was nice about getting away from fireside is

53:40.920 --> 53:45.800
every fireside page looks alike so that would be one downside as if all of the

53:45.800 --> 53:50.600
websites just looked alike again but the upside would be a big improvement for

53:50.600 --> 53:55.760
the listeners and also something that's podcasting to I know compatible and

53:55.760 --> 54:00.680
forward-facing I had a call this morning before the show with an individual named

54:00.680 --> 54:07.280
Matt who is working on a fireside competitor and fireside side note for

54:07.280 --> 54:10.600
those of you don't know we're talking about yeah fireside FM it's pretty great

54:10.600 --> 54:16.280
podcasting hosting platform but a little bit slow on the features and what these

54:16.280 --> 54:21.080
guys want to do is come along with the same idea a CMS a front-end website a

54:21.080 --> 54:27.640
back-end CDN infrastructure but all in on podcasting 2.0 so that's what their

54:27.640 --> 54:31.280
competitive advantage is gonna be is they're they're all the podcasting to

54:31.280 --> 54:33.800
those stuff out of the box they're hoping it's funny this is probably what

54:33.800 --> 54:37.240
you wanted like six months ago a year maybe right yeah it would have been nice

54:37.240 --> 54:41.480
but yeah but I don't know if I'd want to go back what we have now is so much more

54:41.480 --> 54:45.280
powerful so much better for us well and better than actually we had envisioned at

54:45.280 --> 54:48.440
first yeah yeah and there are some features that I think we're gonna come

54:48.440 --> 54:52.400
up with in the next month or two yeah that we've been wanting for a long time

54:52.400 --> 54:56.600
and that are actually pretty awesome and it's made things like transitioning to

54:56.600 --> 55:00.280
peer-to-peer smoother it's gonna make transitioning to having our own RSS feeds

55:00.280 --> 55:04.040
smoother I mean it's it's gonna pay off down the road for stuff we're not even

55:04.040 --> 55:08.320
doing yet yeah I completely completes agrees and then true grits came back in

55:08.320 --> 55:14.920
with a dubs boost again let's give him a little bit of a tutting 1701 sats oh so

55:14.920 --> 55:19.160
he also gets the Trek boost you're doing a good job he says I wish there was a

55:19.160 --> 55:23.160
more granular way in fountain FM to determine which podcast I earned sats on

55:23.160 --> 55:28.560
and which ones I spend sets on I would throw all of my earnings on podcasts

55:28.560 --> 55:32.160
that don't support lightning and boosts but then turn off earnings for the

55:32.160 --> 55:35.760
podcast that do I don't feel like I really earn the sats when they're just

55:35.760 --> 55:39.200
getting streamed right back out also do you guys know if the streaming counts

55:39.200 --> 55:45.520
towards your flow I haven't been able to determine that so this is a great set of

55:45.520 --> 55:50.040
questions grits and fountain FM has this feature now where when you're listening

55:50.040 --> 55:55.320
to podcasts they stream sats to you and they just recently tweaked the way you

55:55.320 --> 55:58.520
earn those sats and they've made it a lot simpler and clearer and I'll have a

55:58.520 --> 56:04.320
link to their explanation in the show notes but just really briefly you now

56:04.320 --> 56:09.800
get paid in fountain for your first hour of daily podcast listening the earning

56:09.800 --> 56:14.040
rate changes every day for each user and it's random some days you might earn a

56:14.040 --> 56:19.000
little but on some days you'll earn a lot you no longer need to support

56:19.000 --> 56:23.640
podcasts or create clips in order to continue earning or to earn more so the

56:23.640 --> 56:27.720
flow idea is kind of out there are no changes the way promotions or regular

56:27.720 --> 56:34.000
clips work that change was done in fountain 4.9 and as we record on

56:34.000 --> 56:41.440
Wednesday October 11th 2022 5.2 just came out they've added a lot of stuff

56:41.440 --> 56:44.740
autocue support which was one of the number one features I heard from the

56:44.740 --> 56:49.440
audience carplay and Android auto has also been added as well as some bug

56:49.440 --> 56:53.240
fixes performance improvements some UI cleanup the way the clips work is a

56:53.240 --> 56:57.520
little bit better now I gotta say I'm really like in fountain I I want I want

56:57.520 --> 57:02.200
pod verse to be my daily driver because it is the GPL one but man the stuff they

57:02.200 --> 57:06.220
keep doing in fountain just keeps bringing me back I love the clips

57:06.220 --> 57:11.000
because I spent time following different people and so now in fountain one of the

57:11.000 --> 57:14.520
things that I just love is if I've got a few minutes I'm burning like maybe I'm

57:14.520 --> 57:18.960
doing a quick chore or something I just go to the clips page and I just hit play

57:18.960 --> 57:22.960
and I just listen through my clips and I find new podcasts I look at that

57:22.960 --> 57:31.280
somebody clipped coder right there this is the joy that you bring Chris I just

57:31.280 --> 57:34.180
so I mean the folks at fountain are doing such great work the folks at pod

57:34.180 --> 57:38.360
verse are doing such great work too we're just spoiled in podcasting 2.0 so

57:38.360 --> 57:42.160
grits go give that post a read just so you can kind of wrap your head around it

57:42.160 --> 57:48.160
if anything they're making it easier now so hopefully you might see on some days

57:48.160 --> 57:51.340
a slower earn rate but it's just gonna be a simpler way you just essentially

57:51.340 --> 57:56.440
listen and I mean the way I basically worked it out one time it's like a SATA

57:56.440 --> 58:00.680
minute or something I was getting so it's slower than it used to be but not

58:00.680 --> 58:06.520
so bad but do you think that's tricky for those who've been trying to really

58:06.520 --> 58:10.200
dive into the system and earn things because it almost feels like it's the

58:10.200 --> 58:13.380
second change almost this month that they've made to this earning system so

58:13.380 --> 58:17.360
do you think they're just trying things to figure it out or yeah they're the

58:17.360 --> 58:23.280
first ever do something like this and I think it does take a lot of work to make

58:23.280 --> 58:28.520
sure it doesn't get gamed and scammed and so I think they've been sorting out

58:28.520 --> 58:32.200
and make it clear enough to so people set the right expectations and don't get

58:32.200 --> 58:36.680
upset I think you got to tweak all of that the idea is kind of compelling so

58:36.680 --> 58:41.340
the sats come from people who buy promoted clips and in the UI when you

58:41.340 --> 58:47.760
open up fountain it brings you to a clips page first and generally there are

58:47.760 --> 58:53.560
eight clips in the UI the first two are clearly labeled they're a different

58:53.560 --> 58:57.800
color and those are the promoted clips everything else isn't everything else is

58:57.800 --> 59:02.320
community generated those two promoted clips at the top are where the sats come

59:02.320 --> 59:05.080
from that's where the sats that you're getting streamed to you when you're

59:05.080 --> 59:08.920
listening that's where they come from and then what grits is asking is well if

59:08.920 --> 59:13.280
I stream those back to the podcaster like what's the point the point is is

59:13.280 --> 59:16.680
you can control the flow rate back to the podcaster and you could preload

59:16.680 --> 59:19.720
your wallet and the streaming you're getting from found it could just kind of

59:19.720 --> 59:24.240
be a supplement you know you know you're getting a little kickback I think it's a

59:24.240 --> 59:27.920
neat system but it is definitely early days still and then true grits gets our

59:27.920 --> 59:38.800
very last boost of the episode with 4040 sats since you guys told me not to clip

59:38.800 --> 59:43.440
and drive last episode which I agree I don't actually do however I do most of

59:43.440 --> 59:47.960
my podcast listening on the road by the time I get to my destination I have

59:47.960 --> 59:52.460
forgotten what the clippable moment is or I don't have time to do it it would

59:52.460 --> 59:56.360
be nice if there was a way as the listener to drop a marker on a podcast

59:56.360 --> 01:00:01.120
and come back to it later like a user set chapter marker of sorts fabulous

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:05.120
idea it is man because I have the same problem I want to make clips of

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:07.800
different podcasts all the time I've got a lot of people following me on fountain

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:12.360
now so I kind of wanted like you know give them something and I I never ever

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:17.080
remember what it was I wanted to clip when I get home or get to my destination

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:21.320
it's a huge problem but I also don't want to like tap out a big old note like

01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:25.600
audible has this feature where you can like kind of bookmark and leave a note

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:30.480
but you're tapping out like a whole note to yourself well that's not safe you

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:34.360
have a little button that just drops like a flag or something like that is a

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:38.560
great idea I think fountain should think about that like a little marker right

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:43.160
there we also got what do you think how do you think this last one on the thank

01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:46.240
yous here goes there but how would you pronounce that last one there is a JLT

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:50.720
my old man vision is JLT Gordon yeah is that what it is I'm zooming but then I

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.680
lost my place in the dock because I had to zoom in so I could read it yeah we

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:58.360
got 4,300 sats from JLT thank you JLT and we got 500 sats from rustic

01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.600
aversa just to send a meow to editor drew and I feel like there's a

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:09.240
relationship starting you know a friendship built out of meows I guess

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:13.440
we didn't have a lot of different boosters but the boosters who supported

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.280
us this week really really stepped up I don't know if we're gonna see that next

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.880
episode so if you've been thinking about sending a boost in getting a comment in

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:23.640
it'd be a great week because it just takes someone like you to support us

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:27.480
anybody out there listening could go to new podcast apps calm grab a new podcast

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.880
app one that's podcasting to know compatible become part of this new

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.960
movement the edge of podcasting technology the real leading edge exciting

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:38.400
community driven stuff not the stuff that's driven by Spotify I don't know if

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.000
you saw this Brent but Spotify just announced that they just bought a content

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.320
scanning company that specializes in scanning podcasts spoken word content

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:52.040
and finding offensive violations and automatically flagging them Spotify just

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.040
bought that company they're gonna probably integrate that into the

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:57.600
platform it's just gonna be great mm-hmm yeah it's what we've always wanted yeah

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.680
I just are so so looking forward to that now you know we're gonna we always get

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.560
letters from YouTube after we do a live stream now I'm also gonna I'm gonna be

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:10.920
getting letters emails from Spotify now it's gonna be part of the whole routine

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:14.480
you know it's just a ridiculous direction podcasting needs to stay

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.160
healthy it needs to stay decentralized so you can do that big cut by becoming a

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:23.040
member at Jupiter party you get all of the network shows ad free or you can

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:26.160
