1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
All right, are you ready to record over there?

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,260
Yeah, it looks good over here.

3
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,400
I brought myself a couple of things.

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,960
I have a new bag.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,280
I should have pre-cut it.

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,000
But what I have here in my hand is a new package of suspenders.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,520
This is now my second pair of suspenders.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,660
I'm upgrading.

9
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm trying to go with maybe some style and some fashion.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I see a design there.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,420
I'm excited to find out what it is.

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,800
Yeah, yeah, it's got like a checkers design on it.

13
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,360
I don't know if I can actually get it open.

14
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,120
I don't know if I have any instruments of which I can avail myself to get this open.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,400
I don't think I do.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,720
I don't know if I do, but oh, I can just rip it open with my intense man strength.

17
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,760
Never mind.

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,800
Oh, geez.

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,440
So yeah, it's a dark blue pattern on there and kind of a checkered pattern.

20
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,040
They're really nice.

21
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,960
I think they're going to look really nice with some of the stuff I have.

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,640
And then the buckles are fancy leather kind of fancy buckles.

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,960
These are like high end.

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,880
Yeah, man.

25
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,840
So I'm excited about it.

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,760
I've been enjoying the suspender lifestyle.

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,480
It's given me a new confidence.

28
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,880
I'm walking around and my pants fit all of a sudden.

29
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,840
And you know, as a guy who's like waist size is always in fluctuation,

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,100
the suspenders are nice because I was always having to adjust my belts

31
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,280
all the time and switch belts.

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,200
And sometimes I would just not have the right belt.

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,880
And I don't have that problem with the suspenders.

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,800
I see suspenders swag in our future.

35
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,800
Oh, I'm all about it.

36
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:32,200
But man, Chris, don't you feel like 10 years older wearing these suspenders?

37
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,320
That's impossible.

38
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,440
At your age, no one wears them.

39
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,320
Oh, I wear them.

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,480
I feel like it is an older man thing.

41
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,760
And I am kind of embracing the look, I suppose.

42
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,880
You know, I'm just kind of like, I'm just getting old enough where

43
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,640
I'm like, I don't think I care.

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,200
I think I just want to be comfortable or whatever.

45
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,840
But I don't want to wear sweats or things that, you know,

46
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,040
all the clothing that has elastic bands.

47
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
Because that's my other way.

48
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,640
That's the other route I could go.

49
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,400
Is just go the elastic banding.

50
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,160
But I got to say, the dude in sweats look, while it works for some people,

51
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,480
does not work for me, man.

52
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,240
It looks like I have given up on life.

53
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,800
That's how I feel about most people that wear sweats, especially in the airport.

54
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,240
Yeah, yeah.

55
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,080
You've seen it.

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,880
I know.

57
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,920
I know I have.

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,320
I don't know what the suspenders deal, how that's going to work in the airport.

59
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,200
I don't know if the metal's a problem.

60
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,600
You just show them your suspenders and they're like, oh, yeah,

61
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,640
you're fine, just keep going.

62
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,000
You're not a threat at all.

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,760
Yeah, it's going to be the gun and the holster that, no, I'm kidding.

64
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,960
I would have a holster, but it'd be a phone.

65
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,440
Could see that being really useful while you're traveling.

66
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,160
My other thing is, like, Alex is, there's just a very slight,

67
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,200
the slightest little, see, and the chair just.

68
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,720
You're drifting away from the microphone.

69
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,400
You're drifting backwards.

70
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,480
It's a thing that maybe he and I can fix.

71
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,320
All right, you ready to start?

72
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,360
Should we record this thing?

73
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,680
Yeah, I feel warmed up.

74
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,960
Oh, I'll tell you, though.

75
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,280
I've been looking forward to this show all week.

76
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,960
Something about it being new.

77
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,280
And my new, you know, I told you about my tab thing I'm doing,

78
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,720
where every device I carry, I'm just keeping the dock in a tab.

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,560
Yeah, that's a great idea.

80
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,240
And you combine that with the boosts coming in.

81
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,200
Those are fun.

82
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,720
I've been getting some of those coming in about the show,

83
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,080
so that's nice to see.

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,440
I think it's kind of fascinating that even now, you know,

85
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,120
we've been doing this for a while,

86
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,200
and we tend to work on tech stuff all the time,

87
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,320
still discovering better ways to work.

88
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,280
Yeah, what do you mean?

89
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,360
Like, using this tool we're using right now to talk,

90
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:26,960
or what do you mean?

91
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,640
Sure.

92
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,080
Well, even just keeping some tabs on your different devices,

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,600
like, that's such a small thing,

94
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,000
and yet is a boost of efficiency, right?

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,680
The workflow tweaks.

96
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,040
Like, why didn't I think of that before is what my thought is.

97
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,360
Like, you idiot.

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,680
Well, there are better ways, but it's a fine method.

99
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,160
It's like a compromise method.

100
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,440
Like, you know what it is?

101
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,240
It's me just kind of realizing the best way for me

102
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,880
to capture these ideas is to have a tab in my web browser.

103
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,000
Even though I've tried all these different apps,

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,360
you know, I've tried all these different methods

105
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,880
of capturing ideas and syncing it

106
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,600
in different open source things and different services.

107
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,520
And then at the end of the day, it's like,

108
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,720
we'll just keep our doc, because it's Hdocs.

109
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,040
It's HedgeDocs, so it's a web app.

110
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,840
Just keep that in a tab.

111
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,600
Just go in there and drop an idea in there.

112
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,080
And you have to kind of go in there about once a day,

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,400
or else it logs you out.

114
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,680
That's my least favorite part about that.

115
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,000
But it's a great collaborative tool, for sure.

116
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,920
Yeah, I agree.

117
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,760
So that's been nice.

118
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,720
I've just kind of been throwing stuff in there.

119
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,560
We've created a chat room to kind of collaborate

120
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,440
on the show, so that's been nice.

121
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,680
All right, are you ready to record over there?

122
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,520
I wonder if somebody,

123
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,680
I wonder if anybody in our audience is crafty enough.

124
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,280
Imagine for a second, dude, just imagine for a second.

125
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,560
In a what?

126
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,080
Your suspenders with holsters for the Zoom and the MD-46.

127
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,920
Right?

128
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,080
Like, we could walk around with holsters

129
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,880
for our recording gear strapped.

130
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,300
We should look into bag, you know,

131
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,040
there's probably stuff we could already use out there.

132
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,200
Would you want a bag or like a clippy thing?

133
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,120
Because I'm thinking.

134
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,400
I mean, you know, I mean like not,

135
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,520
I just mean like vests with like bags or pockets or like.

136
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,680
But you want them a little lower

137
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,360
so you could be like, you know.

138
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Maybe.

139
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,180
I don't know.

140
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,200
I kind of like the idea of like the microphone

141
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,620
is just right here and I just whip it out.

142
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,520
Like almost like you would like a gun,

143
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,000
but I'm whipping out a microphone to.

144
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,520
You need also cable routing, like cable management.

145
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,360
Yeah.

146
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,780
Little straps on the.

147
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,820
The other thing too,

148
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,820
is I think there's various remote controls for the Zoom.

149
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,920
Now that I think about it.

150
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,200
Imagine having the record button

151
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,720
clipped right here to your collar.

152
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,000
So you pull the microphone out

153
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,240
and you just click your collar and you're recording.

154
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,860
You click your collar again and you're done.

155
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,160
We could be up in our, maybe as events come back,

156
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,200
it's time for us to think about this.

157
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,980
Because we're sticking to it.

158
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,540
You know, I was complaining about the Zoom record button.

159
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,120
It's awful.

160
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,640
And so a remote would be pretty sweet.

161
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,100
I know, man.

162
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,940
All right, you ready?

163
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,760
Yeah.

164
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,120
Okay, Brentley.

165
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,660
All right, three, two, one.

166
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,080
It's Office Hours.

167
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,760
With me, Chris.

168
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,720
Hello, everyone.

169
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,080
Welcome in to the office.

170
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,800
The Office Hours are officially open.

171
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,280
Come on in, let's chat about

172
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,300
whatever you feel like talking about.

173
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,680
I'm here every other Tuesday.

174
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a standing offer.

175
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,440
My office door is open to you.

176
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,560
And Brent's here with me.

177
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,840
We're hanging out on the live stream.

178
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,000
Hello, Brentley.

179
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,120
Well, hello, Chris.

180
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,360
Pleasure to be back.

181
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,500
I am enjoying the video feed

182
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,740
that you and I are sharing this week.

183
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,180
Cause I get to see the drum kit

184
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,360
that you've been learning on behind you.

185
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,040
It's looking really awesome.

186
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,880
Thank you.

187
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,360
I think it looks better with me at it though.

188
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,800
Alex just has the best setup.

189
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,640
I know.

190
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,840
And you know, one thing I got to say about Alex

191
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,140
is he's great at displaying the things he loves.

192
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,400
That's something I can learn from him.

193
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,240
Yeah, you're right.

194
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,240
He is, and he does this thing

195
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,280
where things are in spots where you can see them.

196
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,640
So you don't lose them necessarily.

197
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,580
I mean, he has some stuff in drawers.

198
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,260
We all do, but I like that too.

199
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,240
Like 3D printing rules, reels.

200
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,280
I know they're right there.

201
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,800
Yeah, easy to find.

202
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,280
Yeah, we're also joined by the mumble room today.

203
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,360
We got a small mumble crew.

204
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,560
Hey everyone in the virtual log.

205
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,840
Hello, time appropriate greetings.

206
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,680
Good evening.

207
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,500
Hello Chris.

208
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,340
Hello.

209
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,180
Hi guys.

210
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,000
Hello, thanks for joining us.

211
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,440
This is the first office hours

212
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,840
we're doing with a mumble room.

213
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,440
And this is one of the things we want to do

214
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,180
along with our matrix general chat room.

215
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,400
They're just platforms for you guys to join us

216
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,520
and get your questions in and your comments

217
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,720
and stuff like that.

218
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,000
We'll be watching that as we go along.

219
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,600
I thought I'd be rushing out after the show today.

220
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,840
This is why I just spent the extra time today.

221
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,400
Cause I thought it'd be a rush.

222
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,800
But I have been trying to get my lady juke's RV

223
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,740
in for some repair work to get it ready

224
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,580
for some road tripping this summer.

225
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,840
And everything is so, so slammed.

226
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
I went around to a bunch of different shops

227
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,680
trying to find some place that would see us.

228
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,400
Finally, one of our true and tried old shops.

229
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,360
They got us in over a period of a couple of days

230
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,180
to do the work.

231
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:39,200
They were going to take care of us.

232
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,980
They were really doing us a huge solid.

233
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,800
Like we were going to try to get them a gift as a thank you

234
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,960
because it was like above and beyond to try to fit us in.

235
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,440
They called us up yesterday.

236
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,880
And they told us that they had to fire a guy.

237
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,520
And because they had to fire the guy,

238
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,360
they can't fit us in anymore.

239
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,240
And so we're back out on the streets,

240
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,960
not going to get it fixed.

241
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,640
Can you hire the guy they fired?

242
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,360
I know, right?

243
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:01,920
Good question.

244
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,440
But why they fire him, I suppose, is the next question.

245
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,000
Right.

246
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,680
Yeah.

247
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,840
Well, you got to find out and then just work around that.

248
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,960
But oh, man.

249
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,200
And I went above and beyond to get the motors

250
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,640
that they would be installing.

251
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,720
I pulled like every card in the book.

252
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,480
Like I even called the place that I ordered them from.

253
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,560
Like, I really need those.

254
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,600
Can you ship them out super fast?

255
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,960
I even considered paying $210 in expedited shipping

256
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,520
because shipping is so crazy right now.

257
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,040
And I bought a used backup one on Amazon

258
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,920
because that was the only thing that was available

259
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,520
because of the supply chain.

260
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,560
But I bought a used one that thought it should make it.

261
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,000
It should make it.

262
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,800
It should be here.

263
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,200
And it did.

264
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,760
It just arrived.

265
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,180
I mean, I just went above and beyond

266
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,800
to get parts for this thing.

267
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,960
And then to have it be canceled like that, it's a killer, dude.

268
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,000
It's just like it never ends with this stuff.

269
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,040
So that's my downer story.

270
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,800
However, that's not going to stop us.

271
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,680
We're taking my son Dylan on a birthday road trip

272
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,760
down to Oregon for the weekend.

273
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,800
I may end up doing Linux Unplugged this weekend

274
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,960
from a beach town.

275
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,320
I mean, that sounds pretty great.

276
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,280
So, Brentley, it's been also a big week for you

277
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,920
because you finally got to try out a Raspberry Pi.

278
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,360
That's pretty exciting.

279
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,320
It's true.

280
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,520
Give me the whole thing.

281
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,080
Somehow I've not ever had my hands on a Raspberry Pi, which,

282
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,320
I don't know, is somewhat embarrassing

283
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,880
and also very exciting.

284
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,520
So it turns out Alex has a drawer full of them over here,

285
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,040
and three or four of them that he hasn't been using.

286
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,480
But one of them he had set up, which is a great setup.

287
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,120
He's got a monitor here and a keyboard

288
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,960
just for tinkering on stuff.

289
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,920
So it's like a sit down, plug in whatever you want to play with.

290
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,000
And so the Raspberry Pi, he's got one set up there

291
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,960
he let me wipe when we were doing our Nix challenge.

292
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,840
And so this is a Raspberry Pi 4, I believe.

293
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,360
Of course, he has nice little cases.

294
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,200
They're all different.

295
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,360
He has fun with probably printing some of those

296
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,800
or buying them.

297
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,200
And it was great.

298
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,560
Like, I remember the Raspberry Pi 1.

299
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,760
People, you know, you were really excited about it

300
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,440
and its possibilities, but it was really slow and not really

301
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,360
great for much of a workload.

302
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,000
But this thing was, I mean, we were running NixOS,

303
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,320
and it was pretty light.

304
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,120
But it seemed speedy and totally reasonable.

305
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,680
So that just got me quite excited.

306
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,680
And I might just slip one of these into my bag

307
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,680
before I go and bring it home with me.

308
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,160
The possibilities now, right?

309
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,480
Like, you start thinking, especially, Brent,

310
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,400
if you are in a low power situation.

311
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,160
And when I finally convince you to adopt hashtag vanlife,

312
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,240
you're going to be thinking about that kind of stuff.

313
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,440
Give me an idea of what the specs were, if you can remember,

314
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,680
and what you did with it, and what stood out to you.

315
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,960
Because this is, it sounds silly,

316
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,520
but I almost wish I was there for it.

317
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,360
I know.

318
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:44,960
I know.

319
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,040
I was thinking about that.

320
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,880
You've been saying for months that you wanted to be there.

321
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,680
And we meant to do it when you were here,

322
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,800
and we just never got around to it.

323
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,840
Yeah, no, it's fine.

324
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,400
And I'm glad you did, right?

325
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,960
I think our community gets so focused on specs and the tech

326
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,400
stuff that we don't really sometimes appreciate

327
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,240
sort of the cultural impact of some of these devices.

328
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,440
And the Raspberry Pi has made a cultural impact.

329
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,560
It's like a line of computing that is almost its own thing

330
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
in a way.

331
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,000
It's its own kind of branch.

332
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,960
And it's so well supported now, too,

333
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,360
that when these things start to get to the Raspberry 5

334
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,680
and the Pi 6, there's just going to be such awesome systems.

335
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,120
I mean, as soon as you start taking out the SD card

336
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,280
and you start using something more serious, like an SSD

337
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,800
or EMMC, it changes the game on what those things can do.

338
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,000
They're almost like storage constrained right now.

339
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,080
So anyways, I'm just curious kind

340
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,920
of like what details you could share with us

341
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,960
and what you played around with, what stood out to you

342
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,040
in that kind of stuff.

343
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,720
What are you grabbing for it over there?

344
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,560
It's over here.

345
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,920
I'm trying to see if I can get any more information on it.

346
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,440
But as far as I understand, maybe Alex will chime in here.

347
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,960
I think it's just a standard Pi 4.

348
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,360
Maybe it's like a 8 gig version.

349
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,040
I honestly didn't know any better

350
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,360
when I was running it off the SD card,

351
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,560
and it was running just fine.

352
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:02,040
You know, we weren't doing anything storage-related

353
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,000
in terms of intensity,

354
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,200
but I think it just opens up a whole new world

355
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,240
of possibility.

356
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,400
And I'm, you know, late to the game, clearly.

357
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,120
Many of you know this already,

358
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,520
and I've wanted to feel this, and so here we are.

359
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,120
And so I feel like the low power usage, you know,

360
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,640
in your situation is essential,

361
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,400
but also I think the physical size

362
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,680
is also really attractive.

363
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,000
You know, it takes up hardly any space.

364
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,360
You can hide it clearly under a desk very easily.

365
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,320
It's super quiet.

366
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,960
And as you know, that's a thing for me.

367
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,800
You know?

368
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,640
I don't know.

369
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,120
I kind of want to build like a podcasting box

370
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
out of this thing.

371
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,480
I've had that thought too.

372
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,960
It might be possible to replace the Reaper machine,

373
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,920
just the Reaper function with a Pi 4.

374
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,160
Oh, that's saying something.

375
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,240
They make Reaper for the Pi.

376
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,720
They have a build that works on the Pi, yeah.

377
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,560
That is so cool.

378
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,480
That's our recording tool that we use.

379
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,960
Oh, it's in a GeekWorm aluminum case,

380
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,320
which is an awesome aluminum case.

381
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,440
It's a Pi 4, 4 gigabyte,

382
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,920
according to the Badger in the chat room there.

383
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,680
Thank you, Badger Badger.

384
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,040
Roger that, Badger Badger.

385
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,520
Well, that's really cool, dude.

386
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,840
I'm glad you finally got to do it.

387
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:10,360
And you know, we still, I did find that camera module.

388
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,200
So.

389
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,040
Nice.

390
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,280
So maybe we can build a DSLR out of one of them.

391
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,240
Or a webcam or maybe a streamer.

392
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,080
I don't know.

393
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,720
You could stream your yard, your backyard.

394
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,840
I did want to say thank you to all the listeners

395
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:28,040
who were willing to, you know, send me a Pi

396
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,600
or let me play with one.

397
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,960
Especially New West, he asked me about five times

398
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,360
in the last month when I was going to come pick it up.

399
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,000
I think he was just as excited as me for that experience.

400
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,920
So New West, I'm going to still come hang out with you

401
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,400
and grab it and we can, I don't know,

402
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,800
create some kind of project with it.

403
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,560
Build a Pi empire, an empire of Pis.

404
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,440
Empire, that's real nice.

405
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,360
Yeah, you like that?

406
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,200
Uh-huh.

407
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,040
Uh-huh.

408
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,880
All right, well, there you go.

409
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,720
So let's move on.

410
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,720
We have a little podcasting news

411
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,200
that I want to just touch on briefly

412
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,600
before we get into JB News.

413
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,080
I love what the Podcasting 2.0 folks are doing.

414
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,520
Adam Curry, Dave Jones, and everyone that's contributing

415
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,760
to the Podcasting 2.0 standard.

416
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,240
It is bringing a set of features.

417
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,400
It's standardizing things like chapters, transcripts,

418
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,600
the ability to display images in line with content

419
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,320
if you want, a whole range of stuff,

420
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,800
including the value tag and a bunch of stuff.

421
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,960
But one of the things they're working on now

422
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,120
is a podcast medium tag.

423
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,160
Now this is an interesting idea

424
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,400
because it essentially is a signal

425
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:38,280
that the feed can give to a podcast player UI.

426
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,680
And maybe it's a web UI, maybe it's an app, right?

427
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,160
But it's a signal that the app can read to say

428
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,680
this isn't a podcast or it is a podcast.

429
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,920
It is a music album or it's a podcast

430
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,000
or it's an audio book, for example.

431
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,840
And so the interface of the podcast player

432
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,840
could actually potentially adapt

433
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,960
to suit maybe like a music album.

434
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,440
Like maybe a music album is more appropriate

435
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,840
for somebody who's releasing tracks

436
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,680
over a period of weeks.

437
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,000
You could see like an artist

438
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,680
who's working on a value for value system

439
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,280
is creating songs weekly and then releasing them.

440
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,880
And the podcast player could automatically,

441
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,760
if it supported this tag, and the tag will be available,

442
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,520
could automatically select the UI

443
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,280
that best displays albums for music.

444
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,800
And it could be a whole new way of using podcasting.

445
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,360
That is so cool.

446
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,840
Is it a podcast?

447
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,080
I think so, but I don't know.

448
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,080
What is a podcast, you know?

449
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,960
Yeah.

450
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,320
I feel like for things like weekly released audio books

451
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,040
and such, that would be a really neat feature too

452
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,600
to have your interface change a little bit

453
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,000
because you want some different features

454
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,200
when you're listening to those.

455
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,000
So it sounds really cool.

456
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,360
Yeah, and some book authors who have self-published

457
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,960
have also used, maybe they're also podcasters,

458
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,440
so they'll use their podcasting setup

459
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,000
to record an audio book.

460
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,680
And maybe this is a way to release that,

461
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,040
especially if they're already a podcaster.

462
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,880
Why not?

463
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,720
Yeah.

464
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,360
I love seeing this kind of stuff land.

465
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,120
If you haven't checked out the podcast index,

466
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,640
podcastindex.org, this is the new place

467
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,360
to find podcasts in my opinion.

468
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,720
They have over four million shows indexed now.

469
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,160
The entire idea is to sort of decentralize

470
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,160
this critical function of discovery in podcasting, right?

471
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,440
Because right now that's kind of locked up

472
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,240
by Apple and Spotify.

473
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,040
And so the idea with Podcast Index

474
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,040
is to create a neutral Switzerland of podcast indexes

475
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,200
and then add new features that are created

476
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,200
by an open source community and done out in the open

477
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,000
and talked about out in the open

478
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,880
and discussed on their podcasting 2.0 podcast

479
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,440
and on their Mastodon instance and on GitHub.

480
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,040
And so it's transparent, which is really great to see.

481
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,200
And so like, again, we're thinking long-term here,

482
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,560
where do we want this thing to go?

483
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,440
I think podcastingindex.org is a great initiative.

484
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,240
And the fact that it's also Adam Curry's on there

485
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,240
and he has been an absolute essential player

486
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,000
in making podcasts a thing,

487
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,960
in creating the media tags necessary

488
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,680
to make podcasting work with RSS feeds.

489
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,400
And so to see him kind of be involved in podcasting 2.0

490
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,120
I think is also a really good sign.

491
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,720
And I don't know, really as a creator,

492
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,760
I'm just really jazzed about it.

493
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,400
And I kind of talk about it right now

494
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,080
because it doesn't seem like it gets much acknowledgement

495
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,440
in our community.

496
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,240
And I mean, Linux community by that.

497
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,520
And I'm curious to know if you think

498
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,720
maybe I'm being critical here, Brent,

499
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,920
but it seems like in my opinion,

500
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,800
there's so much going on in Linux and in free software

501
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,840
that our community has kind of gotten

502
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,760
a little bit of tunnel vision.

503
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,600
And we've kind of forgotten to think critically

504
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,400
about things like decentralization of services.

505
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,400
And we've kind of stopped looking at free software

506
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,040
as anything beyond the Linux space.

507
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,840
And we kind of think of free software as Linux stuff,

508
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,840
but things like podcasting standards and RSS specs

509
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,320
and cryptocurrencies, those aren't free software.

510
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,040
Those are bad technology, right?

511
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,720
Like there's some serious tunnel vision in our community.

512
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,000
And I feel like the podcasting stuff

513
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,680
kind of parallels a lot of that

514
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,440
is you'd think probably people in the Linux

515
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,720
and open source community would be a little more fired up

516
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,560
about maybe decentralizing our content off of YouTube,

517
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,840
Spotify and Apple, but it doesn't really seem

518
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,080
to ever come up outside of when we're talking about it.

519
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,600
So I guess I kind of feel like

520
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,480
we gotta keep talking about it.

521
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,440
Am I off on this?

522
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,880
Am I, what do you think?

523
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,640
I think you're right about the open source thing.

524
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,480
It feels like our ideals are more than just

525
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,720
some of the software we use.

526
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,640
And maybe we've had it too good

527
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,880
in that RSS has been around forever.

528
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,320
And we've just taken it for granted.

529
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,360
But yeah, for Apple and Spotify

530
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,960
to kind of start to be eating everybody up

531
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,200
is a little bit scary.

532
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,600
And I feel like anything we can do

533
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,760
to get excited about the open stuff

534
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,440
in a variety of different realms in our life

535
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,320
is essential and super, super interesting too.

536
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,800
Like if you think about how much new technology

537
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,160
is coming out just on the RSS technology,

538
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,960
it's like kind of crazy.

539
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,640
I didn't think it was going to evolve anymore,

540
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,320
but all of a sudden we're getting this insight

541
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,240
into all these new, just all these new little tags,

542
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,320
like this podcast medium tag is like,

543
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,280
this technology we've had for a long time is evolving.

544
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,800
It's really fascinating to see.

545
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,440
So I hope everybody can get excited about it.

546
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah, and I think you could argue

547
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,760
the core functionality is still great.

548
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,720
Yeah.

549
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,320
It does a good job of delivering new shows

550
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,040
with show notes and all of that.

551
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,080
The question is, is there room for improvement?

552
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,200
I'd argue, yeah.

553
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,280
I think transcripts would be great for podcasting.

554
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,520
One of the things that's actually kept me

555
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,920
on Fountain FM is the transcripting is really nice,

556
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,560
and that is a handy feature for searching.

557
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,400
And I realized if we could transcribe all of the JB shows

558
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,520
and make those searchable

559
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,120
on our notes.jupitabroadcasting.com search page,

560
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,880
that would mean you could no longer,

561
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,600
you wouldn't just be searching the tags

562
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,440
and the links and the description,

563
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,360
but you could go inside the shows.

564
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,800
And so to build a standard around that,

565
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
like if we want to do that,

566
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,960
I'd like to do it in a way that's in a standard

567
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,600
that all clients could support.

568
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,720
And chapters, you could see a reason for this.

569
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,440
So I'm very excited to see them do it.

570
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,520
And we had a good boost that came into the show,

571
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,840
which I'll read in full later,

572
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,440
but they're like, I get where you're going

573
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,760
with your concerns, but focus on the positive.

574
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,560
And I think that's great advice.

575
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,640
And so that's what I want to start doing

576
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,120
is I kind of want to start looking at

577
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,080
who's moving this forward in the right direction more.

578
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,600
I want to talk about that more.

579
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,840
I mean, when there's major concerns I have,

580
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,680
I'm still going to bring it up.

581
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,680
But that's kind of my thinking is we're going to try

582
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,840
to look at this from a more positive angle.

583
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,240
Like if we focus on these things and we do these things,

584
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,760
we're going to get this going in the right direction.

585
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,480
And I don't know, it's not all together yet, Brent,

586
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,200
but I can't help but feel like podcasting 2.0

587
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,080
and the Lightning Network and Matrix

588
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:54,480
and all of it being decentralized

589
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,960
probably is important right now in a way that it never has.

590
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,120
And when you look at, you look at everyone's freaking out

591
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,960
about Elon by on Twitter, and it shows you just again,

592
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,760
not to really beat on this, but just shows you again,

593
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,640
like centralization bites us in the butt

594
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,760
over and over and over again.

595
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,360
And I just feel like there's something here

596
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,000
we're working on and it's still in its proto stage.

597
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,320
But do you feel it?

598
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,400
It's something coming together

599
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,760
and it's these decentralized technologies.

600
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,160
I have a question on that topic.

601
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,200
The podcast index kind of feels

602
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,040
like another centralized space.

603
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,680
How is that contributing to the decentralization

604
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,200
or is it just another single library?

605
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,720
Boy, we could really get into this.

606
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,360
But the backend is essentially a decentralized way.

607
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,960
The way that you update the system of new podcast releases,

608
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,320
the way that all of that is using the Hive blockchain,

609
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,240
and that is actually decentralized.

610
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,520
The part that is the centralization of the podcast index

611
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,520
would be the LLC that Adam and Dave run behind the scenes,

612
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,480
but that is also replaceable.

613
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,680
It's built in a modular way

614
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,160
where that component could be removed

615
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,880
and the community would continue to exist

616
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,040
because most of the active conversations and control

617
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,120
are happening on GitHub and on Mastodon.

618
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,200
And there's things that happen

619
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,400
that are just completely outside the LLC.

620
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,040
They don't drive it.

621
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,400
There's all kinds of development happening

622
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,440
that they are not necessarily the ones behind.

623
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,960
But there does have to be some sort of interface

624
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,360
with the traditional banks and buying the domain name

625
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,720
and paying for the server hosting.

626
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,680
And so there is that centralized component.

627
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,240
But I would argue that that LLC with a couple of people

628
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,400
that are running something that is decentralized

629
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,520
and being maintained by an open source community

630
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,880
is a way different risk profile

631
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,480
than your Spotify, Apple, YouTube.

632
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,240
It's almost negligent in its risk,

633
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,160
but it is worth thinking about.

634
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,000
That's fascinating.

635
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,560
I can't wait to see where they go

636
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,040
even in the next few years

637
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,560
considering how much work they're putting in.

638
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:52,000
The pace of development is astonishing.

639
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,120
It's really impressive.

640
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,160
I absolutely love it.

641
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,640
And the bottleneck will be the app developers.

642
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,920
That's gonna be the bottleneck,

643
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,840
but it kind of makes sense in a way

644
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,000
because you're gonna have some apps

645
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,280
that are maybe a little more aggressive

646
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,920
in their feature focus and other apps that are less.

647
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,440
And you'll have users kind of try those features out

648
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,680
and somebody said in the matrix room,

649
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,560
I think it makes a lot of sense.

650
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,080
Like you gotta have somebody drive over the potholes

651
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,920
to report them, right?

652
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,920
And we're gonna be driving over some potholes

653
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,760
for a little bit.

654
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,360
That's just the reality of it.

655
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,560
It reminds me a little bit of where Matrix is right now.

656
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,920
Really, it's trying to accomplish something similar somewhat.

657
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,720
It's the interfaces that feel like

658
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,480
they're kind of not quite there,

659
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
but we gotta use them to improve them.

660
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,160
And so it feels like kind of the same

661
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,040
for the Podcast 2.0 stuff.

662
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,840
Yeah, and you can see the trend.

663
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,460
You can see the reasons, the rationale.

664
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,120
So, you know, yeah, it helps.

665
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,200
Okay, so we have,

666
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,000
this was another inspiration for the show.

667
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,280
It's fun having a new show again.

668
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,920
Like I haven't had a new show in a while.

669
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,760
This is great.

670
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,640
You really jazzed about it.

671
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,400
Yeah, this is fun.

672
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,440
Last new show was self-hosted, I guess, right?

673
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,280
It's been a while.

674
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,120
Still a great show.

675
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,960
It's been a minute.

676
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,780
It's been great.

677
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,200
It's still my baby, but it walks on its own now.

678
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,040
You know?

679
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,240
Right now, this is still in the cradle.

680
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,320
But we had an opportunity to like,

681
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,240
well, we have to.

682
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,700
It's not so much an opportunity, but it is.

683
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,320
We've been wanting to do it for a long time.

684
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,280
But we have to rebuild and replace jupitabroadcasting.com.

685
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,840
I mean, it's been in desperate need for a very long time,

686
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,460
but Scale Engine, our host, God bless him,

687
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,680
has decided to get out of WordPress hosting.

688
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,680
So now's the time.

689
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,540
And we want to do it right, and we have a lot of ideas,

690
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,880
but we want to open up this conversation to the community

691
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,960
while we're at the ground floor.

692
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,440
We've got a rough framework of how we want to do it,

693
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,880
but we want to run it past everyone and get your input.

694
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,440
Brent has set up a GitHub page for jupitabroadcasting.com,

695
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,680
or somebody did, but Brent's watching it now.

696
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,360
And people can go there to open up issues

697
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,320
and start conversation.

698
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,160
Is there any hot tips we want to relay?

699
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,760
It's like github.com slash jupitabroadcasting.

700
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,360
Yeah, there are a few projects there.

701
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,160
There's one called jupitabroadcasting.com.

702
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,880
It seems like the reasonable place to go.

703
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,240
So we have some issue tracking there.

704
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,160
There are some issues with the current website,

705
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,520
which are important to know.

706
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,680
And I threw some in there.

707
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,960
There's a lot of them, so that's helpful.

708
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,240
But also, maybe I'll open up a discussion, a GitHub discussion,

709
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,980
and we can just start having conversation

710
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,280
about what the future website could be.

711
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,240
And that's a great place to throw ideas.

712
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,240
Yeah, feedback on this episode.

713
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,860
Nate, title it like Office 3 Website Feedback Thread,

714
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,560
or something like that, if that makes sense.

715
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,280
And we'll put a link in the show notes.

716
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:34,560
But Brent and I had a chance to sit down with Alex and Wes

717
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,280
and welcome them into the office.

718
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:40,240
And this was just after Linux Unplugged on Sunday.

719
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,660
And I wanted to play our conversation that we had

720
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,120
while they were in the office.

721
00:25:44,120 --> 00:26:08,880
I'm joined by some friends to talk about our plans

722
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,960
for the summer and our new website that we're developing.

723
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,000
And we haven't really dialed it all in yet.

724
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,360
So I think this is both the right moment and possibly

725
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,920
the worst moment to open it up to the community

726
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,600
and discuss what we see as the future of the Jupyter

727
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,800
Broadcasting web domains.

728
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,220
Because we've got a lot of websites.

729
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,220
We've got a big mess.

730
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,640
I think everyone agrees, far too many.

731
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,220
Yeah, and it's a legacy install that we've been running forever

732
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,600
on Scale Engine.

733
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,400
And they've let us know that they're

734
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,320
getting out of the WordPress hosting business.

735
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,240
They don't want to host our horrible WordPress.

736
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,320
We don't want to host our horrible WordPress.

737
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,600
Something has to go.

738
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,020
So as a group, Wes, Brent, Alex, and I

739
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,520
have been talking about what we want to see.

740
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,380
And simplicity, I think, keeps coming up over and over again.

741
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:56,400
Speed keeps coming up over and over again.

742
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,800
And the recognition that most of the audience,

743
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,240
when they interact with any of the JB properties,

744
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,280
they're interacting on their mobile device

745
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,200
in their podcast app most of the time.

746
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,680
And we've been brainstorming ways

747
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,700
to create a static website, maybe even

748
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,520
a website that doesn't even have a CMS behind it,

749
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,880
or a very light CMS behind it.

750
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,080
Something that we could programmatically generate

751
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,340
as a new episode comes out.

752
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,120
And I think we've looked at a lot of things.

753
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,040
We've looked at Hugo.

754
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,760
We've looked at MKDocs.

755
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,560
We've looked at a lot of different back ends.

756
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,440
We've looked at ways of integrating

757
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,080
GitHub and GitHub Actions.

758
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,700
Do you have a, in your mind, Wes,

759
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,520
where is our state of the website conversation

760
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,060
from your perspective?

761
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,360
Well, I think we've been discussing where the website

762
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,000
fits, like you say, right?

763
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,800
On one level, we've got the feeds.

764
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,540
And the feeds ultimately kind of control what users

765
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,920
in the podcast apps see.

766
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,240
But we've got sort of parallel infrastructure

767
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,400
in that we've got a main page if you want to check out

768
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,440
the video versions.

769
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,040
Or you've heard about us, you check out our website.

770
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,560
When you go to jupyterbroadcasting.com,

771
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,120
that's the first thing you do.

772
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,200
Plus, we've got sort of ancillary resources,

773
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,080
like the calendar and the increasingly important live

774
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:05,960
page.

775
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,200
Context pages are another one.

776
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,000
A lot of little subsites, donation sites,

777
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,440
little tiny little subsites.

778
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,280
And we've also seen a lot of stuff

779
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,800
that has been thrown out so far, tools we've kind of taken

780
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,000
a preliminary look at.

781
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,600
A lot of stuff evolves around you're

782
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,320
wanting to make one RSS feed.

783
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,080
You're trying to host one podcast.

784
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,560
But we've got that part kind of taken care of right now.

785
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,900
Things we'd like to see improved is a more cohesive

786
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,440
representation across shows, sort

787
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,060
of sharing some of those resources,

788
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,640
making the same workflow work, but having enough flexibility

789
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,920
to account for things like we've got premium versions for folks

790
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,320
that subscribe and want to get the shows ad free.

791
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,040
They share a lot, but they're just subtly different enough.

792
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,320
Not all platforms have the flexibility to account for that.

793
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,560
Or old archive shows.

794
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,640
Maybe we want to make it clear these

795
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,520
are no longer in production, but if you'd like to listen

796
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,560
to them, you can.

797
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,440
Or things like the Mumble info.

798
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,560
We use the Mumble room across multiple shows,

799
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,000
but we only have the Mumble info on the Linux Unplugged page.

800
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,440
Or the Matrix server information.

801
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,000
That's only at linuxunplugged.com slash matrix,

802
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,400
because we don't have a great way

803
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,800
to just build that kind of page for JupiterBroadcasting.com.

804
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,440
And those pages, like the live page, like the Mumble page,

805
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,920
like a donation page, like the contact page,

806
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,640
they change maybe four times a year, right?

807
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,240
That's just it.

808
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,000
I mean, yeah, the cadence of changes isn't crazy high.

809
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,800
And that's where something like either a very light CMS

810
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,920
or no CMS at all starts to make sense, because we just,

811
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,200
besides the hosts of the shows and the editors,

812
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,740
there's not that many hands involved.

813
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,280
There's some.

814
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,660
There's some we need to account for,

815
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,040
and the workflows involved do need

816
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,280
to work for everyone involved.

817
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,040
But I think we have a lot of flexibility in that regard.

818
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,800
Yeah, and one of the things we're thinking about

819
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,220
is, how can our show docs, the ones

820
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,920
that have the description on the links,

821
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,960
how could that be a source of truth for an episode post?

822
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,720
And one of the things that we've realized

823
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,720
has worked pretty well is, Alex, you, and was it the orange one?

824
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,360
You set up notes.JupiterBroadcasting.com,

825
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,080
which is MKDocs based.

826
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,840
Yeah, that's right.

827
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,760
And the way we have to do that at the minute,

828
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,000
because the back end we use to publish the shows

829
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,880
doesn't have a real API that we can query.

830
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,560
We're actually using a library in Python

831
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,660
called BeautifulSoup to walk through the HTML of the damn

832
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,840
web pages, reverse engineer the tags, and pull those out,

833
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,920
and then spit those out into a statically generated website

834
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,160
using MKDocs.

835
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,660
Right.

836
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,280
So that may be one area we can start with just right away,

837
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,500
is we've got some tooling on the back end

838
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,440
that we might be able to get.

839
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,760
Turn that into a database that we control ourselves,

840
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,000
or just a pure data representation

841
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,480
that we store in version control,

842
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,840
and then can feed some other tools

843
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,580
that generate our notes, that generate whatever, you know,

844
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,200
JB main page site that we want.

845
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,880
Maybe that just links to the note site.

846
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,720
Then we've got to kind of decide exactly what we want

847
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,200
all the experiences to be.

848
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,120
Yeah.

849
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,440
Yeah, because the MKDocs is plain

850
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,240
isn't probably the right way to describe it,

851
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,920
but it's not particularly visually complicated either.

852
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,160
I mean, it's good and bad that way.

853
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
I mean, it's very, especially for docs, right?

854
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,200
Like, it is a very consistent, easy to digest website,

855
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,440
which is awesome, but it's not maybe all the branding.

856
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,320
The main thing we wanted for that was easy search.

857
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,020
And for example, in LUP that we recorded

858
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,960
just a few minutes ago,

859
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,840
I wanted to look up the last time we mentioned Wallabag,

860
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,480
or Mini Flux, I think it was.

861
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,380
And I just searched that keyword and boom,

862
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,220
it was right there.

863
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,640
And for me as a host, a podcast host, it's very useful,

864
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,360
but also for audience members, it's useful.

865
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,960
I get people posting in our Discord,

866
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,280
self-hosted Discord all the time saying,

867
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,700
oh, I found this on the notes website, it's right here.

868
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,180
And that's very helpful.

869
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,020
You could see too,

870
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,920
how that might even become more powerful

871
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,280
if some point we had transcripts that that could index.

872
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,120
Now you're talking.

873
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,560
Yeah, I can see that being nice.

874
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,520
So my thought has always been like,

875
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,040
how great would it be if from a host standpoint,

876
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,320
when we're done recording the show,

877
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,360
we get the doc in the right shape,

878
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,440
and then the post for the website

879
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,640
is generated from that doc.

880
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,120
And I don't know exactly what that looks like.

881
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:55,600
Perhaps it's some sort of custom parser that we develop.

882
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,040
And maybe it's some sort of like GitHub action system

883
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,200
that notices when such and such has been updated,

884
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,400
go generate a new Hugo website or something.

885
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,280
Like that could be a direction we go.

886
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,400
I think one thing we need to figure out

887
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,280
is some of the stuff we get from our current CMS

888
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:12,140
allows a little bit more of an ad hoc workflow

889
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,240
for things like guests or sponsors,

890
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,340
that kind of thing where it is structured stuff

891
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,280
that gets somewhat get shared between at least episodes,

892
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,080
and if not shows, which is maybe what we'd really want.

893
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,200
Yeah, yeah.

894
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,480
So are you defining that each time,

895
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,880
or do we have a separate sort of structure

896
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,760
where you can kind of define a guest often,

897
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,840
and then you have to go,

898
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,320
your edit then becomes two markdown files,

899
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,480
or are you adding these to GitHub repo?

900
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,240
Is it, you just leave it in Hdocs?

901
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:40,480
What's the kind of flow between you writing the file

902
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,600
and getting it all the way through?

903
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,900
And also if you have a guest, as we do it right now,

904
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,680
on the main show feed,

905
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,840
you then have to go and add them into the members feed

906
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,840
as two entire separate transactions for us as admins to do.

907
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,400
Right, right.

908
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,880
Yeah, we've also been talking,

909
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,560
like this is probably not part of this,

910
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,760
but there has been multiple times

911
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,640
in just the last few months where it would be a lot nicer

912
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,880
if we were generating all of the RSS feeds.

913
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,920
It's a pain in the butt though,

914
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,360
and it's a lot of responsibility,

915
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,160
and if you get it wrong,

916
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,160
you've essentially just taken your network offline.

917
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,080
So.

918
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,120
But that's maybe part of this,

919
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,400
is trying to figure out the right approach

920
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,280
where we can take pieces of it,

921
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,720
and you know, do as order requires here, right?

922
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,040
Get the website up and going,

923
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,280
but then know down the line that we've built things

924
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,360
in a way that we can start doing the generation

925
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,680
of the feeds that make sense at least.

926
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,840
Yeah, so this is what we're trying to get clarity on

927
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,240
is which direction to go.

928
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,300
Like what are the technology pieces

929
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,560
that we could put together to build something

930
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,880
that is essentially a static site

931
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,580
that gets rebuilt on individual episode launches

932
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,920
that is easy to maintain,

933
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,760
that doesn't have a lot of backend complexity to it,

934
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,160
that perhaps could be fully automated.

935
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,140
Like what are all the right technologies to use here?

936
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,060
And so we wanted to open this part up to the audience

937
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,960
and ask you like, what are you using?

938
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,920
Or what have you seen that works in this space?

939
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,480
Because you know, we basically have until the end of summer

940
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,480
to get this figured out,

941
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,520
and so this is the very beginning of spring

942
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,200
that we're starting to take this very seriously,

943
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,120
and we wanted to open the dialogue up to you.

944
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,820
So send us a boost and let us know

945
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,320
what technology stacks you would recommend,

946
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,980
or you can go to officehours.show slash hair.

947
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,440
No, it's officehours.hair slash contact.

948
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,760
The hair thing is complicated.

949
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,700
It's new still.

950
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,160
It wasn't my first choice, but it's what was available.

951
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,960
See, this is why we're trying to clean things up

952
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,800
around here.

953
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,000
Yeah.

954
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,720
Can't even remember all of our domain names.

955
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,560
It's too much.

956
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,800
Let alone the top level ones.

957
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,820
It's time to clean house.

958
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,660
Yeah.

959
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,500
Yeah.

960
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,380
All right, so we have just laid out a lot there, I realize.

961
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,820
Brent has a link for where the conversation

962
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:57,120
should probably happen.

963
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,580
I could also see us maybe setting up

964
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,060
a matrix room for the website.

965
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,260
That's probably a pretty good idea.

966
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,080
So I'll set that up and we'll put a link

967
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:05,400
in the show notes for that as well.

968
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,300
But I saw a couple people in the mumble room

969
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,460
had some input, so I wanted to start with you, Pycrash,

970
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:13,060
because it sounds like you are a Hugo, a Hugo user, right?

971
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,140
Yes, I use it for my blog.

972
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,900
And the good thing about Hugo, for example,

973
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:22,700
for the staff, for guests, or for example,

974
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,840
for the sponsors, you can just use a template

975
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,540
and update the template for each episode.

976
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:34,540
When you generate a new episode, so Hugo new episode,

977
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:38,140
it will just call the template for episodes

978
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:41,460
and will just add your sponsor, for example.

979
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,700
It will also be interesting,

980
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,140
you cannot really update an RSS feed,

981
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,860
but it will be interesting if the community

982
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:54,380
could update your show notes with a pull request in GitHub.

983
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,820
For example, if there's a correction or something like that

984
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,020
or a link that was missing.

985
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,420
That's an interesting idea.

986
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,620
That's a great idea.

987
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,900
Yeah, wouldn't that be something?

988
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,980
Okay, definitely taking that input into consideration.

989
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,660
I was looking for something similar like you,

990
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,900
and I was doing that for a client,

991
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,900
and I wanted to give him like a look and feel of a CMS

992
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:22,340
so he can edit pages, but still I wanted it lightweight,

993
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,420
and I wanted it to be not complicated to install

994
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,860
on the server.

995
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,260
And for that, there is graph.

996
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,600
It's called getgraph.org.

997
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,600
And it's something between of a web generator and a CMS,

998
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,080
because it has modules and you can install,

999
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,080
in fact, a admin module,

1000
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,880
which allows you to use it like a normal CMS,

1001
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,920
but you don't need to.

1002
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,320
So that's a really cool thing.

1003
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,680
And the best and the coolest thing is,

1004
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,780
you run that thing with PHP and nothing else.

1005
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,500
You only need PHP installed on that server.

1006
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,560
You don't need a database and it just runs.

1007
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,900
So it's pretty interesting stuff.

1008
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,520
May not be exactly what you want,

1009
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,840
but in case just look at it,

1010
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,640
it could be very interesting.

1011
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,240
So getgraph.org looks like it's the website.

1012
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,280
This is, oh, okay.

1013
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,600
And it gives you some of the niceties that honestly,

1014
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,680
it's kind of nice to have dashboards with stats

1015
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,520
and stuff like that.

1016
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,380
It gives you a UI.

1017
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,440
All right, this is also really good.

1018
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,560
And I'll put a link to this to graph in the show notes,

1019
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,640
because that looks like it might be something

1020
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,200
to consider as well.

1021
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,160
Love you guys, that's great.

1022
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,760
And this is an ongoing conversation.

1023
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,760
We, I feel like we probably by the end of May

1024
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,880
need to have our technology stack totally sorted out.

1025
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,920
Don't you think?

1026
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,760
I think that's reasonable.

1027
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,400
And we wanna also test it a little bit, right?

1028
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,420
Before moving and we don't wanna wait the last minute, so.

1029
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,820
I have wanted to redo the website forever.

1030
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,020
So I'm pretty excited about it actually.

1031
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,600
You're not just looking to move the current WordPress

1032
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,480
to a new WordPress host, are you?

1033
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,320
Crossed my mind.

1034
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,400
It did cross my mind to just set up a brand new

1035
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,840
spanking fast WordPress,

1036
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,160
because I've done a few test stacks on Linode

1037
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,880
and they have like, I think, I can't remember,

1038
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,360
I think it's called the Lightspeed HTTP server.

1039
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,820
They have this really nice optimized WordPress stack

1040
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,600
for the Lightspeed web server

1041
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,360
and the whole thing really rocks.

1042
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,360
And so it did cross my mind to go,

1043
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,800
well, I could just do a nice, clean, brand new,

1044
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,420
perfectly set up WordPress install

1045
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,220
and then migrate what we can over.

1046
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,400
But the truth of the matter is this,

1047
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,080
WordPress has always just been way too much.

1048
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,280
You know, I think that's one of the things

1049
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,440
that Fireside showed us is the websites can be a lot simpler,

1050
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,520
a lot cleaner, and just recognize the fact

1051
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,520
that 99, 98, 95, 95, probably,

1052
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,720
somewhere in the 95, 90 range.

1053
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,480
Okay, I'm walking it back a little bit, but.

1054
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,320
92?

1055
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,920
No, yeah, yeah, 93-ish.

1056
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,480
A huge percentage of the audience

1057
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,560
is interacting with the shows either live,

1058
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,800
no, through the podcast app, yes.

1059
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,880
That's where they're doing it.

1060
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,640
They're doing it through the podcast app.

1061
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,600
Or maybe they're listening on the website,

1062
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,240
but it's a pretty small percentage.

1063
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,160
And so the website needs to serve a good function

1064
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
for getting links and finding stuff

1065
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,000
and maybe discovering other shows,

1066
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,240
but we don't expect people to come experience the shows

1067
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,520
while watching them on our website

1068
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,440
like we did when we deployed WordPress 2,000 years ago.

1069
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,760
Because it was all video back then

1070
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,000
and we had this crazy idea that maybe we could drive people

1071
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,520
from YouTube to the JB website

1072
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,120
and they would watch all the content on the JB site.

1073
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,160
But it never really happened.

1074
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,680
YouTube just became a monster.

1075
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,800
It feels like one other thing to keep in mind

1076
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,720
is we do want to take a lot of the archive over.

1077
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,960
So video support is sort of kind of part of it too, right?

1078
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,580
Yeah, you'd want to be able to accommodate it.

1079
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,120
We may want to do video shows in the future again.

1080
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,680
I mean, we're testing video right now as we record this.

1081
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,640
So you want to be able to accommodate for it,

1082
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,300
but the whole website's designed around having a video.

1083
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,540
So we have a video embedded for every podcast episode.

1084
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,200
It just doesn't really make sense.

1085
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,320
There's just things that were old assumptions.

1086
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,480
It's time to update.

1087
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,000
But moving on, speaking of YouTube,

1088
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,320
I went ahead and got into it

1089
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,800
with the Linux Foundation this week.

1090
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,360
And I'll put a link to this in the show notes.

1091
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,160
I was extremely disappointed

1092
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,960
to see the Linux Foundation shill NFTs

1093
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,320
with their crappy centralized hyperledger blockchain

1094
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:24,000
while spreading FUD about free software and Bitcoin.

1095
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,280
Shameful, because they're essentially employing the tactics

1096
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,280
that Microsoft and SCO and others engaged in years ago

1097
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,960
to try to scuttle Linux.

1098
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,920
And so I released a video on YouTube,

1099
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,360
speaking of YouTube, that calls them out.

1100
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,600
And I do a play-by-play of their video,

1101
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,680
and then I read their report that they published,

1102
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,040
and I do some responses to their report.

1103
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,160
And I try to correct some of the FUD

1104
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,840
about misinformation around the Bitcoin mining,

1105
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,680
the Bitcoin mining misinformation around proof of work

1106
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,920
and NFTs, which really, in my opinion,

1107
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,240
the Linux Foundation should be staying the hell away from.

1108
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,080
They should not be shilling any of this stuff.

1109
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,360
They should have never really got involved

1110
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:07,400
with the hyperledger project, but that seems inevitable.

1111
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:12,400
But I also cover a article from 1999.

1112
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,120
In fact, I'd love to put a link to this in the show notes

1113
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,240
if I remember.

1114
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,280
It is such a stinker.

1115
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,200
It was a piece on Forbes in 1999

1116
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,040
about the power draw of the internet and the PC

1117
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,280
and how it would destroy the world.

1118
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,400
And that by the time a billion machines came online,

1119
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,320
all of the PCs in the world would consume

1120
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,880
the entire electrical capacity of the United States.

1121
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,040
And in this article, which I read through in this video,

1122
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,280
they try to put a price point on megabytes transferred.

1123
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:47,280
So they say that there is one pound of coal

1124
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,600
created and burned to move two megabytes of data

1125
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,720
on the internet.

1126
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,120
And this is a classic FUD attack.

1127
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,440
And it all maps back to FUD we're hearing today.

1128
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,920
And this is from 1999.

1129
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,120
So that's in there.

1130
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,360
My issues with the Linux Foundation are in there.

1131
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,520
And I'm just putting the word out there

1132
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,120
for those of you who care about this stuff.

1133
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,080
I'm not releasing this anywhere but on the YouTube channel

1134
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,360
because I acknowledge not everybody cares

1135
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,600
about this kind of stuff.

1136
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,920
But if you want to think where I think

1137
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,640
the Linux Foundation is going wrong

1138
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,760
and the FUD that they're spreading,

1139
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,020
I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

1140
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,640
Just super disappointed.

1141
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,560
It's like, just stay out of this, you know?

1142
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,760
Stay out of this.

1143
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,160
Yeah, it feels like maybe they don't need

1144
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,960
to have an opinion on that.

1145
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,840
Is that their mission?

1146
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,240
Maybe they want to sell Linux source code polls

1147
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,200
as NFTs one day.

1148
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,000
Maybe it's a master plan.

1149
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,720
You know, gotta get that Hyperledger hype.

1150
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,360
Woo woo, woo woo.

1151
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,360
Gotta get that Hyperledger hype.

1152
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:45,400
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you,

1153
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,880
but what you can boost for your podcast.

1154
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,240
West Coast Hamburger sent us a boost two days ago

1155
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,140
for 3,000 sats.

1156
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,520
I just wanted to say I'm looking forward

1157
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,280
to where this new show goes.

1158
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,940
Thank you, office hours.

1159
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,960
I heard rumors of another road trip.

1160
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,120
Any love for us fellow West coasters?

1161
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,240
Hmm, yeah, I think that's our next plan.

1162
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,640
I think we were thinking about it as a team.

1163
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,720
Or at least I was waxing on about it to everybody.

1164
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,640
We just did the East Coast meetup, in the summer

1165
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,400
we did the Denver meetup, and so it

1166
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,400
does seem like it's time to do something on the West Coast.

1167
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,160
So we are reaching out to friends,

1168
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,140
and we're trying to cook up maybe multiple meetups

1169
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:23,700
along the I-5 corridor along the West Coast.

1170
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,380
So we're not sure yet, and I'm still

1171
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,800
trying to get Lady Joops in to get fixed up for all of this

1172
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,240
to actually make a road ready.

1173
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,480
She's still hurting from Denver, but assuming

1174
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,960
we get all that figured out, I'm going to put that in there.

1175
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,720
Also, I want to mention you can now open a channel

1176
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,400
to our lightning node.

1177
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,440
We're going to be adding that to the show notes.

1178
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,000
So if you want to get in on that fun, you can.

1179
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,160
Music Fish wrote in with 777sats three days ago.

1180
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:47,960
Oh, that's fun.

1181
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,880
Is that supposed to mean something, you think?

1182
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,760
Is that like a?

1183
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,440
It's hard to know.

1184
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,000
Maybe they include something in the text here.

1185
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,720
They're right.

1186
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,980
I've seen some pushback about boosts and value

1187
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,060
for value online.

1188
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,000
I just don't think people get it yet.

1189
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,840
Maybe they have never lost one of their favorite shows.

1190
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,880
I know you guys work hard, so I'll be boosting

1191
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,080
to say thank you.

1192
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:10,920
Well, thank you.

1193
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,640
That is very kind.

1194
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,720
Yeah, I was thinking about that, too.

1195
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,880
I have seen some pushback as well, and I totally get it.

1196
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,120
A lot of us don't have very much to give,

1197
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,080
and so when you're asked, it's kind of annoying.

1198
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,640
There's that.

1199
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,640
And I totally, totally understand that perspective.

1200
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,560
And then there is a contingent of folks in the Linux community

1201
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,640
who just don't really like paying for stuff.

1202
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,440
And I don't think that's a very big majority,

1203
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,440
and I don't really get too concerned about it.

1204
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,200
But I do acknowledge it is there.

1205
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,760
I have become just slightly more vocal,

1206
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,640
and I'm going to try to focus on the positives because I

1207
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,360
think all of the concepts I'm laying down

1208
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,760
to support independent content production,

1209
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,920
I think they all map to free software.

1210
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,800
And so I think this is a way free software

1211
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,100
projects could start talking about value

1212
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,240
and maybe coming up with ways to sustain them.

1213
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,240
And maybe we're not going to make people full-time

1214
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,360
developers, but maybe some.

1215
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,160
But it starts with a common language.

1216
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,760
And one of the things that has been coming through a lot

1217
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,960
is some people really do seem to get it, put some people off.

1218
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,080
So we're going to try to find the right middle ground,

1219
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,180
figure out how to integrate it all,

1220
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,760
and we're still figuring that out.

1221
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,120
But some people really seem to click with it.

1222
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:21,240
And you saw Listener Cole come up and help us with Lady

1223
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,680
Joups on the wiring.

1224
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,520
New West came up and helped us out for a day

1225
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,480
here at the studio.

1226
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:28,040
And he continues to be a great participant in our community.

1227
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,200
And Lucas gave us a ride in his Tesla this week.

1228
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,240
And I always like to mention Minimac.

1229
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,240
He's always in here in the Mumble Room.

1230
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,840
Dan Johnson, hardly a live stream

1231
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,800
goes by that Dan Johnson doesn't make it to.

1232
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,920
That stuff matters.

1233
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,360
And we notice it, and it's value.

1234
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,760
And there's a lot of ways.

1235
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,200
And I think once people start wrapping their head around,

1236
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,040
like documentation could be a way to contribute value back,

1237
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,760
or translations, or bug reports.

1238
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,200
Really good bug reports that are actionable are valuable,

1239
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,960
not just something that's a task,

1240
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,240
but something that's actionable and solves a problem.

1241
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:58,720
That's value.

1242
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,780
We could start thinking about things

1243
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,460
like that for free software.

1244
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:03,800
And we're kind of just laying that groundwork now.

1245
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,400
And it is turning some people off.

1246
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,680
And I am trying to figure out how to message it

1247
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,280
in a way that doesn't.

1248
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,200
But I'm still learning, because I'm

1249
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,280
very passionate about it right now.

1250
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,920
So I just kind of jumped all in.

1251
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,400
I didn't grab the deets for this one.

1252
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,920
But we got a boost from that.

1253
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,680
As you can tell, I've been thinking about this

1254
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,520
for the whole episode.

1255
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:22,840
But user 964 said, I love the idea of value for value.

1256
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,160
And I'm also concerned about Spotify there.

1257
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,920
I got the Fountain app, and I bought some Bitcoin

1258
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,240
so I could participate.

1259
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,840
But I think you'll find the audience is much more receptive

1260
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,120
if you focus on the benefits of this new model.

1261
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,440
Instead of the end of podcasting,

1262
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,120
the government is out to get us doomsday stuff.

1263
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,600
And I think that's it, right?

1264
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,120
It's both a solution to what could

1265
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,480
be the centralization of podcasting, as I would put it.

1266
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,840
I don't know if it's the end of podcasting,

1267
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,400
but I'd say it's the centralization of podcasting

1268
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,160
and the fading of independent podcasting

1269
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,740
as a result of changes in the ad market.

1270
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:54,200
But we don't have to focus on that.

1271
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,400
We can instead focus on the positive aspects of it.

1272
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,940
And I think they absolutely nail it.

1273
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,800
So that was a great boost.

1274
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,080
Like I said last week, if you want

1275
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,840
to send in some critical thoughts too,

1276
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:04,480
a boost is a great way to do that because a little bit

1277
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,000
of sugar with that medicine, it makes a difference

1278
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,280
psychologically.

1279
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,480
So there you go.

1280
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,920
Chris, you find when you get the boosts in,

1281
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,000
all of a sudden it changes your ideas a little bit

1282
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
and you think about that for the next maybe 10 minutes,

1283
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,040
an hour, day?

1284
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:17,720
Or days.

1285
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,680
Yeah, because they sent that in days ago.

1286
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,180
Days ago, and I've been thinking about that and chewing it over

1287
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,340
in my head.

1288
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,280
And the tooling of all of it makes it such

1289
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,180
that it's sort of there in front and center,

1290
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,000
and we get notifications about it.

1291
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,360
So before we wrap up today, I wanted to do something

1292
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,440
kind of fun, Brantley.

1293
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,720
I think I know what would be coming.

1294
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,640
We wanted to give away a few Satoshis, a few SATs,

1295
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,680
so people can participate in the value for value model

1296
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,120
and try it out.

1297
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,400
So I have a recommendation out there, everybody.

1298
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,960
Go grab the Breeze wallet or go to newpodcastapps.com

1299
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,800
and get yourself a new podcast app.

1300
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,200
And if you're listening live, when we wrap up the show here,

1301
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,440
we're going to give away 2,000 SATs to three lucky winners.

1302
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,480
So you got a few minutes to go get a new podcast app

1303
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,200
at newpodcastapps.com.

1304
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,160
You need to get into your wallet and generate

1305
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:07,080
an invoice for 2,000 SATs.

1306
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:10,120
Or if you don't want to switch podcast apps,

1307
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:12,580
you could use Breeze, which they're

1308
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:16,000
kind of selling themselves as sort of the shopping mall

1309
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,160
to the Lightning Network.

1310
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,240
So there's all kinds of stuff on the Lightning Network,

1311
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,440
and podcasts are one of them.

1312
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,020
You can add one podcast, you can add office hours,

1313
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,820
and you could send messages in, send us your thoughts.

1314
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,020
So would you do that?

1315
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:28,600
And then join us live one Tuesday.

1316
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,200
We'll do another giveaway on our next episode.

1317
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,080
All right, Brent Lee, thanks for joining us.

1318
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,960
Always a pleasure.

1319
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,480
See you next time.

1320
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,760
Goodbye, everybody.

1321
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,640
Show's over.

1322
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,600
You can go now.

1323
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:58,920
Get out of here.
