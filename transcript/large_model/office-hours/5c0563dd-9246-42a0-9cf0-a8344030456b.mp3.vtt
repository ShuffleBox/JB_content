00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
PeerTube is one of my favorite new tools right now, I think.

00:03.920 --> 00:08.400
The minimum viable PeerTube implementation that I didn't necessarily come up with at launch,

00:09.360 --> 00:13.920
but now weeks into it, it's been great. It's just an archive of our live shows,

00:14.480 --> 00:18.160
and it's just a great way to watch the shows live when we're doing them.

00:18.160 --> 00:22.080
And now with the new website and the integration with the embedded player on the new website,

00:22.080 --> 00:27.760
so it can just ping the PeerTube API and get the latest live stream and then auto embed that on

00:27.760 --> 00:34.640
the webpage, it's now getting integrated and automated. It's so great. And it's all laying

00:34.640 --> 00:41.120
the plumbing so that way when we're generating our own RSS feeds, we can do live streaming in

00:41.120 --> 00:46.400
the podcasting 2.0 app. So you can just listen to our live shows in your regular podcasting app.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.400
That's also going to be powered by PeerTube. There's a real net effect, I think, of going

00:50.400 --> 00:55.360
with PeerTube again. I debated it because we did it once. I had issues with it. I don't think it

00:55.360 --> 00:58.560
was the right take, and then we shut it down, and then we relaunched, and we kind of did this

00:58.560 --> 01:04.080
minimum viable PeerTube, and it's been so much better. It's been a great tool. Very happy with

01:04.080 --> 01:08.000
it. So if you haven't checked out JupiterTube, you got to go over there, Jupiter.Tube. You can

01:08.000 --> 01:14.800
get archived versions of this live stream and all the other live shows. It's Office Hours with me,

01:14.800 --> 01:22.800
Chris. Well, hello, everybody. Welcome into the office. Come on, Brent. Sit down. It's showtime.

01:22.800 --> 01:25.520
Hello there. How are you doing? Hey, do you still have my butt groove here?

01:26.160 --> 01:31.520
Yeah. Yeah, I keep that just right. I got a little model of your...never mind. You don't want to know

01:31.520 --> 01:37.600
how I do that. We'll just move on. I just want you to feel at home, you know? It's a safe space

01:37.600 --> 01:42.880
here in the office. We have so much going on behind the scenes this week that we could make

01:42.880 --> 01:46.480
the week of shows just about the work we've been doing, but we're going to kind of condense some

01:46.480 --> 01:51.680
of it down right here into Office Hours this week. Brent, would you say it's fair to say

01:51.680 --> 01:56.320
it's the final countdown? I think we're slightly past our optimistic final countdown, but yeah,

01:56.320 --> 02:02.880
it certainly is. The actual dead deadline is really coming up. It's getting me a little nervous.

02:03.520 --> 02:09.040
Now, you've been at Alex's house for, I think, about seven years, right? You've been there now?

02:09.040 --> 02:13.920
Yeah. Yeah, six or seven. Yeah. And the opportunity came up for you two to work

02:13.920 --> 02:19.360
together on some infrastructure, and we saw a whole new, I think, push of work getting done.

02:19.360 --> 02:23.920
And so we wanted to update everybody because there's been so many developments since our

02:23.920 --> 02:29.200
last episode that we just had to kind of stop and kind of do a sync up. And so we had a chance to

02:29.200 --> 02:35.360
sit down with Alex and Wes after Linux unplugged last week, and I wanted to play a little bit of

02:35.360 --> 02:39.040
our chat with you just to give you an update on where we're at in some of the infrastructure

02:39.040 --> 02:52.080
decisions that we've made for the new Jupiter Broadcasting website.

03:00.080 --> 03:05.120
We sent out an invite saying, let's build a website, and they came to our party. It is going

03:05.120 --> 03:09.920
incredible. It's a really special day because Wes Payne's here. It's been a bit. Hello, Wes.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.720
Hello. Good to have you in the office.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.880
It's nice to be here. Sorry we didn't have a seat for you.

03:14.880 --> 03:18.640
But hey, I'm happy just to sit right on top of Brent.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.840
I don't know why he has to collect all those seats. I think it's totally fair. I think it's

03:21.840 --> 03:25.840
fair. And Brent, I hope you brought the candy because Alex is here and we did promise candy.

03:25.840 --> 03:30.400
Hello, Alex. Welcome back to the office. If you've been on the office before,

03:30.400 --> 03:32.800
I think you have once, maybe. But it's good to have you here.

03:32.800 --> 03:36.960
I definitely interrupted an episode with the no touchy the chair sticker a while back.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.120
That is very true. He also interrupted one by turning the internet off.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.720
Oh, that's also true. Yes.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.200
Okay, good. So your presence has been felt.

03:45.200 --> 03:46.000
Definitely.

03:46.000 --> 03:52.000
Right. Good. Well, actually, this week, we've got a lot to talk about because I've gotten the sense

03:52.000 --> 03:56.160
that there has been a lot of work to get the new Jupiter Broadcasting website

03:56.720 --> 04:00.560
ready to go from an infrastructure standpoint. I know we have a new domain,

04:00.560 --> 04:05.920
we have some changes, and it sounds like we're getting a lot closer to actually having this

04:05.920 --> 04:09.120
thing finished. So what are we going to talk about, Brent? What's the latest?

04:10.000 --> 04:15.040
Well, a heck of a lot of stuff has been happening on the website this week, so much that I it seems

04:15.040 --> 04:19.360
I can't ever get caught up on all of the sort of action that's happening there, which is a really

04:19.360 --> 04:22.240
good problem to have. I'm not complaining at all. Totally.

04:22.240 --> 04:23.840
We're going to need another Brent.

04:23.840 --> 04:28.080
The team that we've amassed has been really impressive in the work they've been doing.

04:28.080 --> 04:31.120
And the discussions that have been happening have been super fascinating to watch. Chris,

04:31.120 --> 04:33.680
I know you got involved in one or two of them this week as well,

04:33.680 --> 04:35.760
and you got some features that were really cool.

04:35.760 --> 04:40.800
You know, every now and then I've needed to jump in. But for the most part, I feel like it's rare

04:40.800 --> 04:47.440
where something hits like a roadblock that needs me to make a decision. But one area I was providing

04:47.440 --> 04:54.160
some feedback just recently was how we are doing the live embed on the new website. When you go to

04:54.160 --> 04:59.440
new.jupiterbroadcasting.com, you'll see there's a live link. When you go there, we now have a

04:59.440 --> 05:05.440
dynamically inserted PeerTube live stream. So on the back end, using the PeerTube API,

05:05.440 --> 05:10.080
when the new whatever we're streaming, maybe it's Coder, maybe it's office hours,

05:10.080 --> 05:13.280
maybe it's Linux unplugged, maybe it's self-hosted, whatever we're streaming,

05:14.000 --> 05:18.160
the API actually read. You can get that. You can query that information. It makes all of

05:18.160 --> 05:24.080
it available. So when a new stream goes live, the API registers that. And then on the back end, I

05:24.080 --> 05:28.560
don't even know really how they're doing this. Maybe you can tell me. We're getting on the back

05:28.560 --> 05:33.760
end, basically the latest PeerTube live stream auto embedded now on the new website. We don't

05:33.760 --> 05:37.600
have to do anything. Tell us how it's happening, Wes. Yeah, I mean, there's a little bit of

05:37.600 --> 05:42.560
JavaScript right here in the page that's going to go reach out to the PeerTube API, figure out the

05:42.560 --> 05:46.720
latest live stream that's happening, and then dynamically pull the embed code and toss that

05:46.720 --> 05:51.920
into your page. Oh, so it does it on load. Oh, so whatever the live stream is at that moment

05:51.920 --> 05:58.000
will automatically get embedded. Also, just major props to Arwen Thorne. I probably messed that name

05:58.000 --> 06:03.920
up, but just an awesome example. Not only did they make this functionality work in really quick time,

06:03.920 --> 06:08.560
but also added some helpful sort of just improve the general doc system. The code itself is really

06:08.560 --> 06:14.320
well documented. And it's just a nice case where they're not otherwise super active on GitHub,

06:14.320 --> 06:19.760
but just showed up to help us out. Well, and there were a few complicated ways to solve this

06:19.760 --> 06:23.280
problem thrown around where we were trying to come up with ways where we would maybe add a

06:23.280 --> 06:28.240
feature to a chat bot that would then auto embedded on thing and then kick off a build. And

06:28.240 --> 06:32.640
like we were kind of coming up with like rather complicated solutions. And this is a rather

06:32.640 --> 06:37.280
elegant way to pull this off. Nice, simple, easy. Yeah, I like that a lot. And it means we don't

06:37.280 --> 06:42.640
have to go edit the page every time we go live. One last thing we can mess up, right? That's so

06:42.640 --> 06:49.680
cool. You know, Arwen actually created a GitHub account specifically to commit that idea to our

06:49.680 --> 06:56.160
repo, which was really great. And then unfortunately ran into getting flagged as spam because of the

06:56.160 --> 07:02.080
way they have their email set up and vanished along with the changes that they submitted. So

07:02.080 --> 07:05.840
it was a day or so that we were trying to get them back. And they figured it out. They fixed

07:05.840 --> 07:09.680
their email, I think. And we got all those changes back. And we're like, oh, no, that code was so

07:09.680 --> 07:16.320
great. It's gone forever now. But yeah, it came back. Thank you. And is now part of the production.

07:16.320 --> 07:20.400
Lovely. Thank you for actually pushing through all those trials and tribulations to actually

07:20.400 --> 07:24.720
get it across the finish line, too. Yeah, we appreciate it. Yeah, it's been great to see

07:25.280 --> 07:31.840
a lot of new people who have maybe worked on a lot of projects solo, but haven't really worked

07:31.840 --> 07:36.960
in an open source community kind of project. And so there's been some really neat mentoring

07:36.960 --> 07:43.920
happening as well, which I think has been another one of those features that we didn't really expect

07:43.920 --> 07:48.080
to happen. And has been really great to watch. And everybody's been super, super nice and

07:48.080 --> 07:52.160
handholding too much. I'll tell you what I found actually really interesting this week,

07:52.160 --> 07:58.880
as I started to get involved in the project is, is my it's my first time dealing with an open source

07:59.920 --> 08:04.480
project where almost all the discussion happens almost exclusively on GitHub.

08:04.480 --> 08:08.960
Like when I was involved with Linux server back in the day, we did all the chat in IRC or

08:09.760 --> 08:13.840
Discord. And we had private team channels where we, you know, took all the decisions and stuff

08:13.840 --> 08:19.280
like that. But the thing that I've really started to appreciate is just how difficult it is to

08:19.280 --> 08:26.480
communicate all of your thoughts in such a low bandwidth conversation, without either sounding a

08:26.480 --> 08:30.880
little bit rude and dismissive of, well, we shouldn't do it that way because of X, like,

08:30.880 --> 08:36.160
unless you phrase things carefully, it can sound like you're being a little bit up yourself. But

08:36.160 --> 08:42.720
I've been really impressed with the, I guess, the level of discourse that's been happening in all

08:42.720 --> 08:48.000
of the issues that I've certainly been involved when involved with. There is some discussion

08:48.000 --> 08:52.800
happens in the matrix room, but not not a lot. I wouldn't say the majority happens there. It

08:52.800 --> 08:57.600
pretty much all happens on GitHub, which is, I think very, very interesting. Yeah,

08:57.600 --> 09:01.680
we've been actively trying to encourage it to happen on GitHub for, I think, two reasons,

09:01.680 --> 09:06.240
one that I've made public and the other one that I've kind of kept to myself. But you're it worked

09:06.240 --> 09:12.880
on you, Alex. The first reason is, then we can all work sort of asynchronously, because it seems

09:12.880 --> 09:19.360
like almost half the people that are committing ideas and pull requests aren't from anywhere near

09:19.360 --> 09:25.440
the North American time zones. And so there's work happening at night. And so if you haven't been in

09:25.440 --> 09:31.120
the matrix chat all day, whichever time zone you're in, you're not missing stuff. And so you're if

09:31.120 --> 09:35.760
you're working on a specific issue, then everything's there. The other reason is, it forces

09:35.760 --> 09:42.960
you to write your ideas in a really concise and clear way. And it forces you to also make them

09:42.960 --> 09:47.600
very clear for others. And I think sometimes if you're doing real time chat, that's not always the

09:47.600 --> 09:51.600
case, you can't sort of sit for 10 minutes, even I've done this on certain issues, sit for 10

09:51.600 --> 09:57.840
minutes and really think about how do I communicate this very clearly so that there's no question

09:57.840 --> 10:04.400
about what my ideas and even go in and edit it an hour later, when you're like, Oh, I forgot to

10:04.400 --> 10:08.240
mention this other thing. Thank goodness for that edit button, because stuff doesn't care to be an

10:08.240 --> 10:13.920
hour later all the time. Yeah. So I think that's actually another feature of using the of tracking

10:13.920 --> 10:19.440
all of those conversations, hopefully quite concisely, but really with some quality and in

10:19.440 --> 10:23.280
the GitHub issues. And so I just implore anybody that's listening to this, I don't know who's

10:23.280 --> 10:28.480
who's listening, but if you are Hello, if you are on the fence about contributing to an open source

10:28.480 --> 10:34.800
project, this is the perfect one to get started. Because there are so many people who this is their

10:34.800 --> 10:41.200
first one. And you will be in good company. Yeah. And that also doesn't mean that the quality of

10:41.200 --> 10:48.000
work has been low. No, not at all. Very, very, very impressed with people who've been new to the

10:48.000 --> 10:54.400
this kind of GitHub workflow, even who've had extremely high quality of contributions. That's

10:54.400 --> 10:58.400
been super impressive to me. I feel like it's a treat to just watch all the activity happen.

10:59.040 --> 11:05.680
I totally agree with that. And I also appreciate that when I have been required to like,

11:05.680 --> 11:10.240
provide some input, somebody has been willing to like take me in matrix because I'm not watching

11:10.240 --> 11:14.400
all the GitHub threads all the time. So there is that space to be like, Hey, can you go look at

11:14.400 --> 11:18.560
this? And then they just link me to the issue on GitHub that I need to take a look at. And I think

11:18.560 --> 11:22.880
that has been a useful combination. Yeah, it's nice. It feels like kind of one community and not

11:22.880 --> 11:26.560
disparate places. You know, you see a lot of folks kind of onboarding and matrix getting tips for

11:26.560 --> 11:30.240
stuff, maybe throwing out pie in the sky ideas or talking about, you know, sort of vaguer things

11:30.240 --> 11:33.680
before they're ready to shape it into a specific issue. And it's really nice. And I think the

11:33.680 --> 11:37.120
reason why it's working well for people who've never contributed to an open source project

11:37.120 --> 11:41.520
before is a lot of them have contributed to their own projects before. And that's absolutely a

11:41.520 --> 11:46.320
factor. And I think a big part of it is Brent and Stefan's stewardship. I think they've helped

11:46.320 --> 11:53.120
integrate people and, and kind of act as that PMO because it needs somebody who can, especially in

11:53.120 --> 11:57.680
our situation where there's sometimes business requirements that we just have certain things we

11:57.680 --> 12:01.280
want done, or we want to make sure we have certain features or things like that. And so you need

12:01.280 --> 12:05.920
somebody who can interface all of that. And I think that's also helped make it a successful project.

12:05.920 --> 12:10.160
It kind of makes them the spirit of the project in a way to, you know, sort of the ambassador

12:10.160 --> 12:14.800
of the culture and how things get done and welcoming new users. And that's, that's really

12:14.800 --> 12:18.800
nice to have established. Although, are we celebrating too soon? I mean, we kind of have

12:18.800 --> 12:22.640
like a mission accomplished sign behind us right now. We're not actually done yet. Careful. There

12:22.640 --> 12:28.960
are some very large sub projects that still need some work, sort of like the archive, for instance,

12:28.960 --> 12:33.920
and some people are working on that on the background. But one of the main thrusts of my

12:33.920 --> 12:38.480
being here at Alex's place for the last, what, three weeks, something like that, has been to try

12:38.480 --> 12:42.800
to get Alex involved in the project. And he did mention that he he has been involved. But Alex,

12:42.800 --> 12:47.360
you did some crazy neat stuff that I only understand about 50% of. Can you walk us through

12:47.360 --> 12:53.200
that? Well, for the last couple of years, we've been running the Jupyter broadcasting

12:53.200 --> 12:57.520
infrastructure sort of here, there and everywhere. I think it was about a couple of years ago,

12:58.240 --> 13:04.080
that we, we started deploying some infrastructure for the self hosted show. And I wanted to use

13:04.080 --> 13:08.480
infrastructure as code to do that, you know, things like ansible and terraform to do that to manage,

13:09.200 --> 13:14.000
you know, things like DNS records, why would we want to log in manually to the Cloudflare

13:14.960 --> 13:20.080
interface, for example, type in some numbers like cavemen, and every time we make a change,

13:20.080 --> 13:27.360
that doesn't really thrill me that kind of stuff. What does thrill me is, you know, having a specific

13:27.360 --> 13:34.160
label in my Docker compose file, and having the the code have the ability to pass through that

13:34.160 --> 13:41.120
entire compose file, pull out the text from those specific labels in ansible, and then use an

13:41.120 --> 13:46.880
ansible module to update the Cloudflare DNS record to match the IP address with the DNS entry that

13:46.880 --> 13:53.280
that I'm looking for. So that's one of the things that we've done is the the website has moved from

13:53.280 --> 14:02.080
jupyterbroadcasting.net. Now it's at new.jupyterbroadcasting.com, N E W, new.jupyterbroadcasting.com.

14:02.080 --> 14:09.120
And there it will stay until we're MVP version 1.0, whatever you're calling it. Once it's in

14:09.120 --> 14:13.840
production, obviously, that will turn into jupyterbroadcasting.com. The other thing that

14:13.840 --> 14:20.800
we've done is automated using GitHub actions. So for those that aren't familiar, GitHub actions is

14:20.800 --> 14:27.520
a free continuous integration platform that's kind of built into GitHub. It's honestly has made

14:27.520 --> 14:34.160
tools like Jenkins almost kind of irrelevant overnight for projects like ours. So you know,

14:34.160 --> 14:39.040
I mentioned Linux server a few minutes ago, but but back when I was involved in that project,

14:39.040 --> 14:46.160
we had our own Jenkins server that was had remote workers at team members houses and it would SSH

14:46.160 --> 14:51.840
in and run jobs on their, you know, Raspberry Pi's, for example, to build Pi images and super neat

14:51.840 --> 14:57.520
stuff. But let's be honest, that's kind of a pain in the bum. And so what GitHub actions gives us

14:58.160 --> 15:03.520
is the ability to run jobs on their infrastructure. And, you know, GitHub's owned by Microsoft,

15:03.520 --> 15:08.160
so everything runs on Azure. So it's, it's reasonably performant. And most importantly,

15:08.720 --> 15:14.720
it's free. So why wouldn't we use it? It's not completely open source. That's one argument.

15:14.720 --> 15:21.440
But free and open ish. I don't know. I think it's fine. And not, not irreplaceable either,

15:21.440 --> 15:26.000
to be honest, Alex, like we if we needed to eventually change where we build the site at it,

15:26.000 --> 15:30.080
it would take us an evening, right? It's not the end of the world. So here's the thing we were

15:30.080 --> 15:36.160
we're building this Hugo site, and it's 20,000 pages, I think 20, just nearly 21,000 pages at

15:36.160 --> 15:42.160
this time. On my MacBook Pro, which is one of the M one chips, it takes nine seconds to build the

15:42.160 --> 15:53.440
website. Nine seconds. But I want it now. However, what we're doing is building it on one of the

15:53.440 --> 15:58.000
Linode boxes that we use for the self hosted infrastructure. And this box is hosting quite

15:58.000 --> 16:04.560
a few things. Now, actually, it's hosting the new JB website. It's hosting our notes infrastructure,

16:04.560 --> 16:09.920
our notes infrastructure. So hedge doc is up there. There's a bunch of stuff. There's probably

16:09.920 --> 16:14.880
a spin. Yes. Yeah, there's probably about, I don't know, 15 or 20 services up there,

16:14.880 --> 16:19.360
between all the various things, and just throwing another nginx container on there hosting a Hugo

16:19.360 --> 16:25.040
site is absolutely no sweat for this thing. What does make it break a sweat, though, is building

16:25.040 --> 16:32.160
the Hugo website. So when it's building the site, it's engaging all four cores of this box, and it

16:32.160 --> 16:38.240
takes 44 seconds. So not the nine seconds of an M one MacBook Pro, but 44 seconds is still pretty

16:38.240 --> 16:43.440
good enough. Faster than I could have manually created the WordPress post and posted the episode

16:43.440 --> 16:47.840
still. So that's something. And the real nice thing about it is as part of the workflow that

16:47.840 --> 16:52.480
happens in the GitHub action, everything happens declaratively and sequentially. So you say,

16:52.480 --> 16:57.760
right, first of all, I want to clone the new code onto the onto the box. And then I'm going to SSH

16:57.760 --> 17:03.840
into the box and do we're using a make file, which is another thing I'll touch on in a minute that

17:03.840 --> 17:10.400
we simplified. It builds the website, and then only once the build is successful, does it actually

17:10.400 --> 17:15.440
pull down the old container and replace it with the new one. So the downtime when it performs an

17:15.440 --> 17:22.240
update is about a second or two, which I think is perfectly acceptable. Now, something I alluded to

17:22.240 --> 17:27.760
a moment ago is the make file updates that we've done. The version that was there before was a

17:27.760 --> 17:33.920
Brent confided in me that the the chap that submitted those changes had never written a make

17:33.920 --> 17:39.040
file make file before and did pretty good considering indeed. However, I think the thing,

17:39.040 --> 17:44.720
one of the principles I like to apply to this sort of project is simplicity is best keep it simple,

17:44.720 --> 17:50.480
stupid, you know, and the make file that was there was trying to do a couple of things it was

17:50.480 --> 17:56.080
trying to cater to local build environments and also Docker build environments. And so

17:56.080 --> 18:02.720
we've taken the decision to just standardize on Docker as the build environment for everything.

18:03.600 --> 18:09.040
That way, people across all architectures, all servers, all places, you know, it doesn't matter

18:09.040 --> 18:14.240
where you know exactly which version of Hugo you're running, you know, exactly which encapsulated

18:14.240 --> 18:19.200
version of libraries you have, etc, etc. So hopefully, it should make things for people

18:19.200 --> 18:25.440
across the world who want to contribute to this thing easier to contribute to, or move it if we

18:25.440 --> 18:30.320
ever needed to move it to a new server or new location to absolutely yeah. And then we were

18:30.320 --> 18:36.080
talking about well, where once we've built the site, do we push it to a Docker registry somewhere

18:36.080 --> 18:41.440
like Docker hub or GitHub container registry or GitLab or, or any, you know, there's lots of

18:41.440 --> 18:46.160
options. And ultimately, because of the way we've we've actually decided to do it, we're just SSH

18:46.160 --> 18:50.720
ing into the server using the GitHub action, fetching the latest changes from Git doing the

18:50.720 --> 18:56.000
build, and we don't actually push an image to a registry at all. Yeah, simplicity. I mean, there

18:56.000 --> 19:02.400
were some great ideas of how to accomplish that. And many of them had multiple parts. And I think

19:03.040 --> 19:08.160
landing on simplicity is going to be good for future proofing this thing. Again, it keeps costs

19:08.160 --> 19:14.160
down, it makes the deployment time faster. And we don't actually need versioned artifacts of the

19:14.160 --> 19:18.720
website. If you think about it, we already have that by the commits in the repo. Yeah, that's

19:18.720 --> 19:23.920
true. That's actually really nice. That's one of the things I love about this system. That's great.

19:24.560 --> 19:28.160
And I also feel like I have to be more accountable. Like I have to explain my changes now too,

19:28.160 --> 19:30.800
because you got to say what you know, what is this commit about? I'm like, well, here's what I'm

19:30.800 --> 19:35.920
updating and why I'm doing it. And I never did that before with the WordPress website. I'll tell

19:35.920 --> 19:40.240
you that it's sometimes bugging with start working, stop working, you never knew what was happening.

19:40.240 --> 19:45.360
That's the thing, right? I mean, there are several principles in software development, which we're

19:45.360 --> 19:51.840
trying to inject into this project. One of which is feature branches. So any new feature for the

19:51.840 --> 19:59.040
website goes to feature slash name of feature, you know, let's say update host, image, whatever it

19:59.040 --> 20:03.600
is. And then that goes through a peer review process. So any changes that make it to production

20:04.240 --> 20:08.480
are now automatically built and applied by the user. And that's a really good thing.

20:08.480 --> 20:13.120
Now automatically built and applied, but only once they've been reviewed by two or three people,

20:13.120 --> 20:20.400
whatever the processes we land on looks like. And then for infrastructure changes, we have a similar

20:20.400 --> 20:26.800
thing. So it'd be infra slash, you know, update IP address, for example, that kind of thing. And

20:26.800 --> 20:32.000
then myself, maybe in ways or Brent could review that and, and merge that stuff. So yeah, and you

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
did create a separate repository for the infrastructure stuff. I think that's an important

20:36.000 --> 20:40.800
distinction as well. Yeah, I mean, didn't actually create it was actually the old self hosted show

20:40.800 --> 20:47.600
GitHub organization. And we've migrated that info repo across. So the really nice thing about doing

20:47.600 --> 20:51.760
it this way is I haven't really had to build hardly anything at all, all the code was already there.

20:52.400 --> 20:56.320
And I've been using it to manage my personal infrastructure for the last five or six years.

20:56.320 --> 21:00.160
And so it's pretty battle tested. There's a there's a couple of there's a couple of things in

21:00.160 --> 21:05.200
it that I know how it works. And I'll document those things. But for the most part, it's,

21:05.200 --> 21:11.200
it's all in the make file. So I have a question in terms of performance. So we have it on a

21:11.200 --> 21:18.720
linode box. One advantage that scale and scale engine had as a host is Alan builds a CDN and he

21:18.720 --> 21:25.360
puts a lot of the PHP files and the CSS files and the image files across this CDN, which

21:25.360 --> 21:29.920
theoretically helps with performance, although I think performance has not been fantastic,

21:29.920 --> 21:34.240
because the the flaw has been the database isn't super fast, it all has to connect to that database.

21:34.240 --> 21:38.000
So what are we doing for performance in terms of like global audience and reaching this all

21:38.000 --> 21:42.720
in one linode box and that kind of stuff? Right now diddly squat. Yeah, right now. Well, yeah,

21:42.720 --> 21:46.240
it's a we should be clear right now. It's a test site. It's a development site.

21:46.240 --> 21:49.520
But we would like people to look at it new dot Jupiter broadcasting.com.

21:49.520 --> 21:55.920
There were some ideas floated in the GitHub around using s3 to host the Hugo site rather than a

21:55.920 --> 22:01.200
container ran into some issues, which we may be able to work around some other way. I don't know

22:01.200 --> 22:07.360
yet, but it took about 17 minutes to upload the website to an S three bucket versus the less than

22:07.360 --> 22:14.320
one minute to build and deploy it as a container. Now, I am a cloud flare noob. I've only just

22:14.320 --> 22:19.520
recently accepted cloud flare into my life after resisting for a long time. But I know you're more

22:19.520 --> 22:24.400
familiar with it, Alex. But I'm, I'm pretty sure there's some some caching tricks we could do at

22:24.400 --> 22:29.440
the cloud for cloud flare level as well, too, right? They do have a proxy service, which

22:29.440 --> 22:36.400
should help protect us against things like D doses, as well as provide us with more of a CDN style

22:36.400 --> 22:44.080
caching layer. And since it's a flat file site, maybe that's sufficient. Yeah, in theory. But the

22:44.080 --> 22:50.400
issue is when you enable the caching button on cloud flare, it changes the IP addresses. So you

22:50.400 --> 22:54.560
end up being low balance between a couple of things. And then the headers don't quite route

22:54.560 --> 23:00.000
properly. And I haven't quite figured that out yet. And if anybody is an expert on that, please

23:00.000 --> 23:05.200
jump into there's a GitHub issue open for this issue. Right now, come and help me figure it out,

23:05.200 --> 23:10.160
please. I could see that being one problem, especially on release day. You know, that was an

23:10.160 --> 23:13.600
issue we had before is on release day, this site would get slammed for the first few hours and then

23:13.600 --> 23:18.080
file, you know, this page doesn't load and stuff like that. Now the files will be hosted on a

23:18.080 --> 23:23.280
different CDN for the mp3s and whatnot. So that'll help because the cloud flare released I can't

23:23.280 --> 23:28.000
remember what it's called our two, I think as like a layer that sits in front of s3 and caches

23:28.000 --> 23:32.800
everything there. So maybe in time, that's something we can investigate. But for the MVP,

23:32.800 --> 23:36.080
I think we'll stick with what we've got. Yeah, I mean, there's also a lot of ways we could pull

23:36.080 --> 23:40.400
that off. Because we could also use linodes object storage, and maybe it builds on that

23:40.400 --> 23:44.160
Linode and then it uploads to object storage, and then our two sits in front of that or something

23:44.160 --> 23:47.440
like that. I mean, there's a lot we could play with. But I think we'll have to just get a feel

23:47.440 --> 23:52.080
for how the performance is, because the component that I don't really know, and I'm sure was always

23:52.080 --> 23:57.760
a factor in the past, was the database, I think, for us, the bottleneck was when people would come

23:57.760 --> 24:02.480
to the website after like Linux unplugged came out, or Linux action show came out, the database

24:02.480 --> 24:06.160
would just get absolutely slammed with page loads. And then you're generating that WordPress page,

24:06.800 --> 24:10.480
every single time the page generates, even with some of those caching plugins, there's still a

24:10.480 --> 24:14.960
lot you're dynamically generating. Not a problem with Hugo, of course. Another issue you've got to

24:14.960 --> 24:22.960
solve for with s3 is TLS certificates. So the s3 object storage that Linode provide, they provide

24:22.960 --> 24:28.480
an out of the box TLS certificate for linodeobjects.com, whatever the bucket name is.

24:29.200 --> 24:33.120
But you would then have to figure out how to configure your own Jupiter broadcasting.com

24:33.120 --> 24:38.480
TLS stuff. Right, right. And at the moment, with the containerized version that's deployed,

24:38.480 --> 24:42.000
that's all handled through traffic and let's encrypt. Yeah, I mean, maybe that'll be performing

24:42.000 --> 24:46.400
enough. We'll just see, right? I mean, I would prefer to leave all the s3 stuff out if we don't

24:46.400 --> 24:50.960
need it because it just keeps it simpler. I guess we'll find out when this episode releases, huh?

24:50.960 --> 24:55.680
Yeah, we just need more people trying it. Mini stress test. Yeah, we just got to build more

24:55.680 --> 25:00.320
traffic and then because when we flip it live, what I'm thinking is eventually we just start

25:00.320 --> 25:05.840
de-emphasizing the fireside pages and we stop sending people to the individual fireside pages

25:05.840 --> 25:09.600
and we start sending people to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash office. Just one

25:09.600 --> 25:13.360
great place to go. So and then we'll start sending more and more of the traffic back to

25:13.360 --> 25:17.280
our main site again because we've spent the last three and a half, four years sending people to

25:17.280 --> 25:22.000
our fireside pages because that's where we could really apply leverage at that time.

25:22.720 --> 25:27.760
But this is a way better setup. So thank you for all the work on the info guys. I feel like we're

25:27.760 --> 25:32.640
in a way better position to go live now, but also we're in a better position to maintain it over the

25:32.640 --> 25:38.800
long term as well. So it's good to be figuring that out before we've even gone into production.

25:38.800 --> 25:43.840
Everything is in git and everything is in for his code, which just gives me the warm fuzzies, you

25:43.840 --> 25:49.840
know? All right. Thank you gentlemen for coming into the office. I appreciate your time. Appreciate

25:49.840 --> 25:53.360
you being here. Brent, where do we want to send people that are listening if they want to

25:53.360 --> 25:58.320
participate? Yeah, I think we'll put a few links in the show notes, but a good place to go. If

25:58.320 --> 26:03.680
you just want to see what the heck we're talking about, new.jupiterbroadcasting.com and I think

26:03.680 --> 26:13.680
our Jupiter broadcasting GitHub page is probably the place to go. So now is the time to really put

26:13.680 --> 26:19.040
this thing through its paces and a mini Mac, you had a suggestion regarding the GitHub aspect of

26:19.040 --> 26:24.240
this and how you can actually integrate GitLab too if one wants. Yeah, indeed. In fact, so for

26:24.240 --> 26:30.000
those who don't want to use get because it's owned by a company that you don't want to mention your

26:30.000 --> 26:36.160
name. So all the GitLab users know that they have the possibility to create their own homepage on

26:36.160 --> 26:44.880
GitLab hosted on GitLab. And there is a possibility to in fact deploy a Hugo website similar to

26:45.520 --> 26:54.320
Git actions within GitLab. So you are limited to these GitLab homepage service, but you can in fact

26:54.320 --> 27:00.080
do the same thing as you do now on Jupiter broadcasting. You can do it in combination with GitHub

27:00.080 --> 27:06.960
and then have your own GitLab homepage based on Hugo and then you can just redirect your favorite

27:06.960 --> 27:12.000
domain to that GitLab homepage and you're good. I don't really have an excuse, but I feel like we

27:12.000 --> 27:16.960
don't give enough plugs for Git T as well, which is also a GitHub alternative. Doesn't necessarily

27:16.960 --> 27:21.600
do some of the stuff we're talking about right now, but Git T is also a great solution. I've heard

27:21.600 --> 27:26.640
really good things about Sourcehead as well. Oh yeah, I noticed Git T also just has an app you

27:26.640 --> 27:31.360
can one click install an umbral now. I bet you they got a Linode something something or other.

27:31.360 --> 27:36.000
I bet you they got a Linode something something one click as well. In fact, I want to say holler

27:36.000 --> 27:42.960
over to Linode. Linode.com slash Jupiter. Linode is investing right here in office hours because

27:43.760 --> 27:47.440
they want to invest in the community. I mean this isn't like come on this isn't going to be

27:47.440 --> 27:54.160
JB's biggest show and Linode is savvy enough to know that. But they also know that the community

27:54.160 --> 27:58.880
is worth investing in that it pays dividends and that's also why they're making our road trip

27:58.880 --> 28:05.600
possible again this year. So go to Linode.com slash Jupiter and get $100 in 60 day credit over

28:05.600 --> 28:10.560
at Linode and you support the show. It's where we host everything that we do publicly now. Linode

28:10.560 --> 28:17.920
also has a bunch of really nice advanced features. They support Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible. They

28:17.920 --> 28:24.720
have a really clean simple API that already has a bunch of pre created libraries for Python and for

28:24.720 --> 28:29.920
Rust and for all the things. They also have a command line client that is choice. I really

28:29.920 --> 28:37.120
love that. In fact, a little pro tip. Install the Linode command line client on your actual Linode

28:37.120 --> 28:43.600
machine, right? So then when you're SSH into your Linode box, you could create a snapshot

28:43.600 --> 28:49.440
of that very box on that box before you do a system update. Just take it to the next level,

28:49.440 --> 28:55.280
guys. It's really easy. And of course, they have great things like S3 compatible object storage,

28:55.280 --> 29:00.160
which you could always use as the seed for, I don't know, R2. And then you could just like

29:00.160 --> 29:08.560
have the most insane great CDN with incredible reach at great prices. Oh, and by the way, Linode

29:08.560 --> 29:13.840
30 to 50% cheaper than the hyperscalers out there. But there's a lot of ways you can host,

29:14.560 --> 29:17.920
but none of them are as good as Linode. They've got the best support. They got the best performance.

29:17.920 --> 29:24.480
They got 11 data centers and nobody else invests deep into the community, into the media,

29:24.480 --> 29:31.440
into the events, into the projects, even into things like road trips that just connect

29:31.440 --> 29:37.520
all of us together. Who else is doing that? Nobody. So go to Linode.com slash Jupiter.

29:38.400 --> 29:44.800
Support the show. Say thanks for your support and get that $100 to mess around. It's pretty fun.

29:44.800 --> 29:51.280
Linode.com slash Jupiter. And you know, we like it because we're rebuilding this whole thing from

29:51.280 --> 29:57.760
scratch. We could have hosted this stuff anywhere. You know, we could have put it anywhere and we

29:57.760 --> 30:03.040
went with Linode. We choose Linode over and over again. You know, like a good marriage with your

30:03.040 --> 30:08.160
loved one where you choose to be their partner over and over again. We choose Linode over and

30:08.160 --> 30:14.400
over again. Linode.com slash Jupiter. Speaking of Linode, you know what else we have hosted on

30:14.400 --> 30:21.200
Linode? What's that? Our massive matrix server. Oh yeah. Alex was showing me just how massive

30:21.200 --> 30:28.000
that server is and it's a lot of triple digits is all I saw. Yeah. Yeah. You know, you don't

30:28.000 --> 30:36.160
need the 96 gigs of RAM to run matrix, but it helps. You know? How many cores? I think it's

30:36.160 --> 30:43.280
got 48 cores or something like that. It's, you know, here's the problem. You know where you

30:43.280 --> 30:49.280
end up using all 48 cores is if you have 40 people logging in at once because every time a user logs

30:49.280 --> 30:55.440
in and sinks their element client, it pegs one of the cores to a hundred percent. So if you have

30:55.440 --> 31:01.120
a dozen people logging in at once, that's a dozen cores locked up. They can't do anything else.

31:01.120 --> 31:06.080
And so ultimately we're like, well, there's a lot of ways we can solve this and we need to make this

31:06.080 --> 31:12.800
better and we need to use workers better. There's a lot still to do, but there is a way we can just

31:12.800 --> 31:17.360
throw hardware at this and it will survive. And the server has been great. It's been, and the

31:17.360 --> 31:22.000
community is continuing to grow. We just launched another matrix room that we wanted to let people

31:22.000 --> 31:29.120
know about. It's for the Ohio Linux Fest that's coming up in December, December 2nd and 3rd.

31:29.120 --> 31:33.120
You can find out info at olfconference.org. We'll have a link in the notes.

31:34.240 --> 31:37.680
And this has been a thing that's happening more and more. And we just want to encourage the hell

31:37.680 --> 31:41.600
out of it. Somebody contacted us and said, Hey, I'd like to organize my own meetup with fellow

31:41.600 --> 31:48.880
Jupiter broadcasting listeners in the Columbus area. So we said, that's a great fricking idea.

31:48.880 --> 31:53.520
So we created the Columbus club. So if you'd like to join our matrix room and coordinate

31:53.520 --> 32:00.160
for our Linux Fest meetup in Ohio, you can go to bit.ly slash Columbus club.

32:02.400 --> 32:05.520
And there's already people in there organizing right now. It's already happening.

32:05.520 --> 32:11.440
I noticed a bunch of venue suggestions. It's like months away. It's amazing.

32:11.440 --> 32:14.560
Didn't we said we would set something up, but did we actually tell anybody?

32:14.560 --> 32:18.480
Like did they just find it? I think we only mentioned it in Linux and plugged quickly.

32:19.040 --> 32:22.560
And I think it was only on the pre pre show or something crazy like that. Well, it's a thing.

32:22.560 --> 32:28.240
It's official bit.ly slash Columbus club. And another shout out for Ohio Linux Fest.

32:28.240 --> 32:33.360
I really enjoy it. I've only made it once. And it was like before two of my children were born,

32:33.360 --> 32:37.760
but I really enjoyed it. And I think it's a great crew out there. And it's going to be

32:37.760 --> 32:43.760
at a brand new venue this year. The brand new Tower of Hilton Columbus downtown hotel.

32:44.560 --> 32:48.640
I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but new seems nice.

32:48.640 --> 32:54.160
I'm not sure it's completely done being built. I heard rumors in our little room that they were

32:54.160 --> 33:00.160
finishing some stuff. Really? That is a new hotel. Well, I mean, it's in December, so a brand brand

33:00.160 --> 33:04.960
new. It's got that new hotel smell. Either way, I love a brand new hotel. I really wish I could go.

33:04.960 --> 33:10.000
There's so many events this year that it just hasn't worked out for me. And it's really stinging

33:10.000 --> 33:16.400
me in my, you know, my my missing events open wound. Your events feels, you know, if this goes

33:16.400 --> 33:23.120
well, you know, I think we could have a meetup room for every major city, like some in Europe.

33:23.120 --> 33:27.120
Why not? We've got one already. I think we should have some more. I shouldn't say this,

33:27.920 --> 33:31.360
but I got to document it while I'm thinking about it. But I shouldn't say it while we're

33:31.360 --> 33:36.160
in the middle of this project. But we need a website. We need a website. People can go

33:36.960 --> 33:42.640
and organize meetups. It's not meetup.com. We need something specifically for J.B. audience

33:42.640 --> 33:47.920
members to sort of self organize in their areas. So you're feeling like these matrix rooms maybe

33:47.920 --> 33:51.440
aren't quite enough. And so I'm curious of the future. I think they're supplemental, right?

33:51.440 --> 33:56.880
They're supplemental to meeting a meetup organized because you could have most people would use the

33:56.880 --> 34:00.480
Web page and they'd have some people that want to help organize the details or have questions.

34:00.480 --> 34:05.040
They join the matrix room like like you have with the regular meetups. But this would be one

34:05.040 --> 34:10.720
specifically for Jupiter broadcasting members to create their own. I know there are a few

34:10.720 --> 34:16.240
open source like options, meetup alternatives, let's call them. I wonder if we can embed

34:16.240 --> 34:21.600
something like that. Me, too. I wonder if anybody out there knows. I believe the the no agenda show

34:21.600 --> 34:26.320
had a community member create the no agenda meetups page at no agenda meetups dot com.

34:26.320 --> 34:30.560
And then you can either find a meetup or submit a meetup. I don't know exactly how it works. I've

34:30.560 --> 34:35.680
never done it, but it seems like it's a tool that's built specifically. Maybe maybe it's

34:35.680 --> 34:40.320
forked. I don't know. I can't really tell looking at it, but it's it's for their community to self

34:40.320 --> 34:44.240
organize and do their own meetups. And maybe that's taking it too far, but it seems like that's

34:44.240 --> 34:48.480
the next step. I'd really I encourage this kind of thing because number one, if these things

34:48.480 --> 34:52.320
started picking up momentum every now and then we could drop in like rock stars like, hey, what's

34:52.320 --> 34:57.040
up, everybody? Brent's here. Just a surprise visit. Yeah. Right. I think that'd be pretty great.

34:57.600 --> 35:01.760
So anyways, but it starts it starts with just a good old community chat room,

35:02.400 --> 35:08.160
bit dot l y slash Columbus Club. If you have suggestions for other areas, if you're interested

35:08.160 --> 35:12.000
in starting to meet up in your area, let us know. What do you think? Should they just hit us up on

35:12.000 --> 35:18.160
Matrix? How should maybe boost it in? What, Brent? So many options. Um, it's a good question,

35:18.160 --> 35:24.000
you know, and it brings me to the idea of, like, feature requests. And we've been trying to figure

35:24.000 --> 35:29.680
out a good place for that. But I feel like any official channel, like if you want to send it into

35:30.320 --> 35:34.560
one of the email addresses, I think you could probably go to new dot Jupiter broadcasting

35:34.560 --> 35:38.720
dot com slash contact. There's a contact form there. That'd be a good way to do it.

35:38.720 --> 35:43.520
It seems on topic. Otherwise, just hit us up somehow. But keep it brief, please.

35:43.520 --> 35:47.680
It's time to get to some of the great boosts that have come into the show. And man, did we get a

35:47.680 --> 35:53.280
bunch of great boosts. We got a stack of boosts. We got a boost bank that's busting. Last week,

35:53.280 --> 35:59.440
we talked about why we didn't trust crypto and how there's crypto. And then there's Bitcoin.

35:59.440 --> 36:03.200
And we talked a little bit about the future of boosts and how we're considering keeping the

36:03.200 --> 36:08.400
segments tight and flowing and all of that. We got a lot of responses. So we are going to

36:08.400 --> 36:13.520
consolidate some of the boosts. So if your boost doesn't get directly read this week, I 100%

36:13.520 --> 36:17.920
promise you we did read it. We went through all of them before the show. We're just kind of pairing

36:17.920 --> 36:24.480
it down a little bit for reasons that I think will become clear as we go along. So Bradley,

36:24.480 --> 36:29.520
why don't you kick us off with our first from Mr. Castaversa? Sure. Rusty Castaversa wrote in

36:29.520 --> 36:34.480
thousand cents. Getting involved with crypto in general is hard, and I don't trust things that

36:34.480 --> 36:39.600
make it easier. I also don't want to give my ID. And thanks to your suggestion of Fountain,

36:39.600 --> 36:44.400
I earn SaaS through listening and can send them back without giving up what I consider to be

36:44.400 --> 36:50.480
private info. I think this is great that Rusty is thinking about the privacy and the KYC stuff so

36:50.480 --> 36:54.000
that know your customer regulations are just kind of like what you got to do if you're going to be

36:54.000 --> 36:57.600
a financial institution in the US. It's not necessarily this way outside the US, although

36:57.600 --> 37:01.840
I imagine it's probably pretty similar. It's got to be similar up in Canada, right? Yeah,

37:01.840 --> 37:07.040
I believe it totally is. Welcome to the West, where we're going to track all of your financial

37:07.040 --> 37:11.840
info just in case you might be a terrorist. And so if you don't like that, and I can understand

37:11.840 --> 37:17.360
why you wouldn't, because you don't necessarily want to have your ID attached to a Bitcoin address,

37:17.920 --> 37:23.760
then I recommend RoboSats. You need the Tor browser, but RoboSats is fantastic. Just take

37:23.760 --> 37:28.320
your time with it. You can anonymously buy Bitcoin. You find a seller. You can read reviews

37:28.320 --> 37:33.120
about the seller, and then you pick the one that supports the payment method you want. Maybe you

37:33.120 --> 37:37.760
want cash. Maybe you want to check. Maybe you want PayPal. Maybe you want cash app. Maybe you want

37:37.760 --> 37:43.040
whatever Apple Pay. RoboSats will let you do that, and then they'll help you escrow it and make sure

37:43.040 --> 37:46.480
everything's safe and good to go. And it's all done over the Lightning Network. So the privacy

37:46.480 --> 37:51.840
is just absolutely outstanding. It's how I'm going to be buying all of my long-time holding

37:51.840 --> 37:56.160
Sats going forward. As far as spending money goes, like the ones I'm just buying right now,

37:56.160 --> 38:00.320
as far as spending money goes, like the ones I'm just boosting around town like a maniac,

38:00.320 --> 38:03.440
I think Strike's fine for that, because you're sending it over the Lightning Network. They're

38:03.440 --> 38:07.280
going into a node wallet. They're getting mixed with everybody else's. And then shout out to

38:07.280 --> 38:15.200
Fountain. In the last three months, I have earned 36,084 Sats. That is not trivial. Yeah, just by

38:15.200 --> 38:20.560
listening to podcasts. That is impressive. I play their game. I listen to some of the supported clips

38:20.560 --> 38:25.440
and the popular clips, but I don't mind that. I would have done that anyways. And I boost and

38:25.440 --> 38:30.160
support some of the clips and that helps you earn more. And then I've also referred some friends

38:30.160 --> 38:35.280
and that helps you earn more as well. But that's 36,000 Sats in the last three months. And I can

38:35.280 --> 38:39.440
just send those around to different shows that I listen to without ever buying anything. All I'm

38:39.440 --> 38:46.160
doing is just listening. Getting paid for what you already do. Al Carney wrote in with 1,024 Sats.

38:49.280 --> 38:54.640
From my limited understanding, Lightning is not Bitcoin, but rather a layer on top of it.

38:54.640 --> 39:00.080
I would assume that the extra convenience comes at the cost of fewer protections from bad actors

39:00.080 --> 39:05.760
that the slower moving blockchain would provide. This is a good question, Al Carney, because in

39:05.760 --> 39:11.760
blockchain world you can have fast and less secure and you can have decentralized and more secure,

39:11.760 --> 39:18.080
but then you get slower. And so that's kind of the trade off. Lightning is sending Sats. It is Sats

39:18.080 --> 39:22.880
that are being sent over the Lightning network. It's not a derivative. And Lightning does its

39:22.880 --> 39:28.880
finalization on the Bitcoin blockchain. So all the transactions that are finalized are using

39:28.880 --> 39:33.280
Bitcoin and the security in there. The reason why you can send them instantly, you don't have

39:33.280 --> 39:38.880
to wait for the blocks to get processed, is because Lightning is based around channels.

39:38.880 --> 39:43.760
These channels open up between nodes directly and they lock funds, it's called liquidity,

39:43.760 --> 39:49.280
into these channels. And so if you want to send a 5,000 Sat boost, we need to have a channel that

39:49.280 --> 39:55.280
has at least a 5,000 Sat capacity that the two ends have agreed to. Because those Sats are locked

39:55.280 --> 39:59.120
to that channel and that's been settled on the blockchain, you can actually use that to move

39:59.120 --> 40:05.440
these around. And so you get instant settlement with Lightning, it's private, it's peer to peer,

40:05.440 --> 40:09.840
and it's actually using Sats and it's inheriting the security of the layer one blockchain,

40:09.840 --> 40:13.600
which is Bitcoin. So Lightning is layer two, rides on top. It's a beautiful system.

40:14.320 --> 40:18.480
And it's, I think, one of the bigger innovations that's coming out of Bitcoin and it'll eventually

40:18.480 --> 40:22.960
be used for other things besides Bitcoin, I would imagine. And we have some pretty good

40:22.960 --> 40:28.240
channels open with some important players too, don't we? Yeah, we have like a big million Sat

40:28.240 --> 40:31.920
channel open to Fountain FM, so people, if they're using that app, boost directly in.

40:31.920 --> 40:36.800
I got a channel open to your nodes, so you get a split on office hours. And instead of having to

40:36.800 --> 40:41.040
route all around the network and take those little tiny fees, which are like fractions of a penny,

40:41.040 --> 40:46.160
you just get it directly from my node. In fact, when I look at my stats, I see it all the time.

40:46.160 --> 40:50.400
My node is communicating directly with your node, nobody in between us. A boost comes in,

40:50.400 --> 40:54.720
it lands on our node, you get part of the split and our node helps route it. It's so great.

40:54.720 --> 40:55.680
Node to node network.

40:55.680 --> 41:03.680
Yeah, it is. It's one big happy node network. We got a row of McDucks. That's 22,222 Sats from

41:03.680 --> 41:10.720
Marcel. Thank you kindly. He says, it's easy to dismiss RHEL when 99.9% of all the distros out

41:10.720 --> 41:15.600
there are HANA Montana Linux. I don't think any amount of Sats should automatically get a message

41:15.600 --> 41:19.840
onto the show either, by the way. It should just be based on the quality of the comment.

41:19.840 --> 41:23.840
You shouldn't be able to advertise your own thing for a thousand Sats, for example.

41:24.560 --> 41:29.680
You know, as a team, Marcel, we have been kicking this around because we want to keep the

41:29.680 --> 41:34.640
productions tight. We don't necessarily want to run long every single week. And we've been floating

41:34.640 --> 41:41.760
around different ideas. One idea we're currently having is we'll just read the top four boosts in

41:41.760 --> 41:47.200
every show. And the top is just in terms of comment quality, not necessarily Sat amount. We'll read

41:47.200 --> 41:53.120
the top four boosts every show. And then we'll also read the baller boosts in the show. So you

41:53.120 --> 41:58.400
get your baller boosts read and otherwise we'll just read all of them because we read 100% of them

41:58.400 --> 42:03.360
and we'll just pull forward the top four is what I'm thinking. And I don't know, it's new. Maybe

42:03.360 --> 42:08.880
it's a practice we should try here first. It seems like something we'd probably want to standardize on

42:08.880 --> 42:13.600
all the shows just to make it consistent. What are your thoughts, Brent? Yeah, I think it's actually

42:14.320 --> 42:18.640
a surprisingly good problem to have. You know, I remember months ago we were just trying this out

42:18.640 --> 42:23.680
for for the first time and we weren't sure if this was going to take off. But clearly it has and

42:23.680 --> 42:28.080
people are loving it. There's like, you know, so many little games and like nifty little inside

42:28.080 --> 42:34.880
jokes and stuff. I love that about the boosts. But, you know, we don't want the shows to be like

42:34.880 --> 42:39.360
just boosts. I think that would actually take away from the content we've been working so hard to

42:39.360 --> 42:45.440
produce. So, yeah, I think we should try it. This show is a good way, you know, a good place to try

42:45.440 --> 42:49.600
that stuff. But it doesn't mean we're going to land on the right solution right away. So keep

42:49.600 --> 42:53.520
sending in your suggestions and I guess your opinions in this case. Let us know what you

42:53.520 --> 42:58.880
think of the top four idea plus baller. Top four plus baller boosts read on each show. Let's,

42:58.880 --> 43:03.360
if we can remember, let's try it next office hours and see how it goes. And, you know,

43:03.360 --> 43:08.160
boosting your feedback because we're just kind of figuring this out. This is the show where we run

43:08.160 --> 43:15.840
with scissors for sure. DFJ 225 boosts in with eight thousand one hundred and ninety two sets

43:15.840 --> 43:21.920
coming in hot with the booth. I love that one. He says, I appreciate the boost and the crypto

43:21.920 --> 43:26.720
conversation last week. I can see the positives with Bitcoin and podcasting and other independent

43:26.720 --> 43:31.920
efforts. But guys, I think it's hard to separate out the use cases from all the other, quote,

43:31.920 --> 43:36.720
crypto bros who are hyping things up in order to just make a profit. And they largely look at

43:36.720 --> 43:41.520
Bitcoin as just an investment vehicle. Sadly, I think it's hard to stand out from this noise.

43:41.520 --> 43:47.040
To me, this is a key difference from the early days of Linux. The hype was not from people

43:47.040 --> 43:54.880
looking to get rich quick. I agree and disagree, DFJ. I think you were probably just hanging out

43:54.880 --> 44:02.000
in the in the good crowds. There was in the late 90s, in the early aughts, a mad gold rush

44:02.000 --> 44:07.760
in corporate Linux. And there was a culture shift where we stopped calling things free software

44:07.760 --> 44:12.320
and we started using the term open source more. And then it kind of became like this big deal

44:12.320 --> 44:16.480
when different companies would start switching to the use the word open source. Like when Red Hat

44:16.480 --> 44:21.920
did it, it was this big upset in the community. Oh, they've gone so corporate. And there was

44:21.920 --> 44:27.920
a genuine gold rush. The story of how Linux got to the X86 server market is a fascinating one

44:27.920 --> 44:35.760
and maybe one we should dig into someday just for like a little bit of, you know, context, I suppose.

44:35.760 --> 44:40.240
Revolution OS isn't bad to check out. It's on YouTube. And I'll have a link in the show notes

44:40.240 --> 44:46.480
to kind of just give you an idea of how far things have come from those early radical thinkers

44:46.480 --> 44:52.880
to today's corporately deployed and managed Linux. There was a huge gold rush in the early days of

44:52.880 --> 44:58.080
Linux. And, you know, I think a lot of us in the desktop and just enthusiast space managed to stay

44:58.080 --> 45:04.320
fairly well insulated from that, just like those Bitcoin stackers who are just stacking sats and

45:04.320 --> 45:08.560
staying humble and going to work every day. They're not really making a big deal about it.

45:08.560 --> 45:14.400
That's that's a huge percentage of the Bitcoiners out there. Fryer Tech boosted it with 2000 sats.

45:14.400 --> 45:20.560
He's going to send in an email, too. But, you know, he had a message for those who are experiencing,

45:20.560 --> 45:26.800
quote, boost fatigue. And this is not our message. This is a message from Fryer Tech. But I think

45:27.440 --> 45:32.160
I feel like Fryer Tech at some point has been a business owner. He writes, I hope someday you have

45:32.160 --> 45:37.200
the luxury of running your own business where the hours of work never end. You have to ensure you

45:37.200 --> 45:41.840
deliver a quality product to your customers and you have to make it a safe space and place for

45:41.840 --> 45:46.880
your employees to thrive. If you feel like you're hearing too much about how you can keep supporting

45:46.880 --> 45:52.800
a business that you kind of depend on every day, maybe you don't realize how much value for value

45:52.800 --> 46:02.240
is actually helping you. Stop complaining, Karen. Spicy. There's, you know, a bit of I had this

46:02.240 --> 46:07.040
realization, too, like I think I know what somebody's job is like or what an industry is like.

46:07.040 --> 46:15.600
And then this is like when, for example, I became an IT contractor for doctors and lawyers and an

46:15.600 --> 46:21.040
airline. And I thought I knew what those businesses were beforehand. And then I get inside and I

46:21.040 --> 46:26.640
realize I knew 10 percent. They end up spending way more time on stuff I never knew about.

46:26.640 --> 46:34.080
And the cost to run a business, you can never understand how wildly expensive and ridiculously

46:34.080 --> 46:38.000
costly it is to run a business until you've run one, especially here in the States right now.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.160
It's incredible. So I appreciate the sentiment, Friar Tech. Thank you very much. You know,

46:42.160 --> 46:45.760
it's not our audience's problem, though. We just try to produce a great product, give them something

46:45.760 --> 46:50.080
that they want to support. And the ones that get it that do participate in the value for value

46:50.080 --> 46:56.080
system, they are so, so critical to the, you know, the long term survival of both the network, but

46:56.080 --> 47:00.000
also our passion and our enthusiasm, because when we do see somebody get it and they're contributing

47:00.000 --> 47:04.480
to the website or they're sending in a boost or maybe they're sharing the show with somebody,

47:04.480 --> 47:07.760
you know, or they're participating in a live stream in a way that contributes value. It's like

47:08.320 --> 47:12.320
that's what keeps us going. That's what makes us keep going after 15 years. And so the people who

47:12.320 --> 47:18.080
do get it are super valuable to us. Dylan wrote in with three thousand five hundred cents.

47:18.880 --> 47:25.280
Boost, you know, actually, as an aside, this is Brent. I feel like Dylan wrote in and mentioned

47:25.280 --> 47:31.920
how to pronounce their name and I totally forget. So apologies. Sorry. OK, here we go with the

47:31.920 --> 47:38.400
boost. Fun fact, you have to be invited to a matrix space to enjoy it. So unless JB provides a link

47:38.400 --> 47:44.480
to it on, say, their site, you can't reach it. I can browse the rooms on your server in an app,

47:44.480 --> 47:51.120
but it's not as great, in my opinion. Yeah. So a space. Let's back up a little bit. A space

47:51.120 --> 47:57.040
space is kind of what it sounds like. It's an area, a place to organize all of your other rooms.

47:57.040 --> 48:02.000
So we've got rooms for the shows and different meetups and Bitcoin and all that stuff. And so

48:02.000 --> 48:07.840
you need one directory to organize it all. That's what a space is. And so we have a Jupiter broadcasting

48:07.840 --> 48:13.360
space where you can get an overview of all of our matrix rooms when you go to bit dot l y slash

48:13.360 --> 48:17.360
Jupiter Colony. But better than that, we're going to have the matrix linked. We're going to have

48:17.360 --> 48:20.640
the mumbling. We're going to have all this stuff linked on the new website. In fact, it's already

48:20.640 --> 48:26.800
there if you want to check it out. Heck, yeah. New dot Jupiter Broadcasting dot com. Peter wrote in

48:26.800 --> 48:35.360
with 5000 sats boost. You guys get it. Crypto equals scam. Those initial feelings of distrust

48:35.360 --> 48:40.080
is a healthy sign of a critical mind. I think people should be critical of this stuff as well.

48:41.200 --> 48:47.920
And I hope that our position that Bitcoin is not like the rest of crypto will be the signal through

48:47.920 --> 48:53.600
the noise long term. Yeah, I think that critical mind and the distrust is good. But I think I also

48:53.600 --> 48:58.560
think there's some really cool technology behind like, say, Bitcoin and lightning and some of the

48:58.560 --> 49:03.680
open source projects happening there. So I think I would suggest, you know, be cautious, but also

49:03.680 --> 49:08.640
stay curious and go check those out. They're worth they're worth looking at. True Grits wrote in 6000

49:08.640 --> 49:18.240
sats coming in hot with the boost every time. I love that one. I'm very much not tired of the boosts

49:18.240 --> 49:23.120
nor of the sound bites. I very much enjoy them. Fountain is getting better and better and better

49:23.120 --> 49:29.760
as a podcast player. And many of the early bugs have been well sorted out. Are there chapter

49:29.760 --> 49:33.200
markers set for the beginning and the end of boosts? Maybe if people are tired of them, they

49:33.200 --> 49:38.400
could just skip them. Absolutely. In fact, Drew goes to the hard work of chapter in every single

49:38.400 --> 49:44.880
boost individually. And might I add very creatively and hilariously sometimes, which I appreciate.

49:44.880 --> 49:52.000
Yeah. We got a double boost from true grits satellite sets. You mentioned that the boosts

49:52.000 --> 49:57.360
have a split that goes to Brent. How? How does that work? How about the SAT streams? Does that

49:57.360 --> 50:03.120
get split with Brent as well? Yeah, it's the same system. So when you boost in in one boost a gram

50:03.120 --> 50:08.880
with a sum or you just stream on the back end, that's all the same splits because it just goes

50:08.880 --> 50:14.320
by what we define in the RSS feed. So the part of podcasting 2.0 amongst the many features it's

50:14.320 --> 50:19.920
bringing to podcasting is a value tag that you add to the RSS feed. And in there you just say,

50:20.720 --> 50:25.520
you know, this X amount, this percent goes to this person, this percent goes to this person,

50:25.520 --> 50:29.920
this percent goes to this person. And it automatically figures it out if you're

50:29.920 --> 50:35.760
doing a one time big boost or you're doing a stream in the back end. It's all the same tech.

50:35.760 --> 50:40.400
And what's beautiful is because the lightning network is so cheap for transactions, you could

50:40.400 --> 50:45.680
actually do one, two, three sats at a time and that still works. So Chris, the way I understand

50:45.680 --> 50:52.480
that the lightning network works is on these lightning invoices. So whenever you send a

50:53.120 --> 50:58.160
certain amount of sats, it automatically creates an invoice. Is that how these streaming works?

50:58.160 --> 51:02.800
That doesn't seem very efficient. Generally, the way it would work is for you to send me sats,

51:02.800 --> 51:07.440
right, you would invoice me and then I would scan the invoice like with a mobile app. It would just

51:07.440 --> 51:10.320
auto fill the information and it would send you those sats. And it's nice and quick,

51:10.880 --> 51:16.000
but it doesn't actually have to be invoice based. The lightning spec does allow for just sending,

51:16.000 --> 51:21.440
just spraying sats in a direction as well without qualifying them. Yeah. Here you go. Here's some

51:21.440 --> 51:26.800
sats. Yeah. But you know what? It's great for these types of things because you could also see

51:26.800 --> 51:31.360
how like you could use it for car rentals, scooter rentals when you're in a city. Oh,

51:31.360 --> 51:37.200
that is a great idea. Nice. Yeah. I could see it go in places, Brent. I really could. All right.

51:37.200 --> 51:46.560
We got 2,222 sats, a row of ducks from hashtag reckless. He says a cold shower in Raleigh is more

51:46.560 --> 51:52.400
like a warm shower. Really? Let's be honest. So true. We both were talking about our cold showers.

51:52.400 --> 51:58.080
I did get the water heater fixed Thursday last week. You know, it's been, I think over here,

51:58.080 --> 52:04.720
it's been three, two, at least two weeks now, maybe three of trying to get contractors over here on,

52:04.720 --> 52:08.400
on, on some kind of home warranty that Alex is trying to take advantage of. And it's,

52:08.400 --> 52:13.440
it's not fixed and they're all back now. So you're all taking cold showers while we're taking

52:14.240 --> 52:20.800
somewhat warm showers occasionally. You know, it's, it's actually kind of embarrassing for

52:20.800 --> 52:25.200
the contractors. Alex had a firm talking with them this morning, so we'll see what happens.

52:25.200 --> 52:28.240
Oh, maybe something will happen. You know what? This is just prepping you for hashtag van life

52:28.240 --> 52:31.840
where these kinds of things happen on the regular. You're just getting ready. I think,

52:31.840 --> 52:36.240
I think I, I much prefer getting my own hands dirty and being responsible. Yeah, really.

52:36.240 --> 52:41.920
Hashtag reckless says, I had some thoughts about donating versus buying too. He writes,

52:41.920 --> 52:49.680
I donate as a member because I want to support the show and I'm buying the ad free feed. I boost

52:49.680 --> 52:55.440
because it's fun and I'm buying a potential shout out on a future show. Possibly this is another way

52:55.440 --> 53:00.960
to reframe the buying versus donating argument. A thousand sat boost minimum would probably make

53:00.960 --> 53:05.600
sense or something more. He says maybe even 10,000 sats, but I want to back up the part that I liked

53:05.600 --> 53:09.840
that I thought made a lot of sense. I boost because it's fun and I'm buying a potential

53:09.840 --> 53:15.120
shout out on a future show. I donate because I want to support the show and I'm buying

53:15.120 --> 53:20.320
the ad free feed. That's a really smart way to look at it. Yeah, it's a neat way to frame things.

53:20.320 --> 53:26.560
And, uh, I really appreciate that perspective as well. Got me thinking. Optimus Gray boosted

53:26.560 --> 53:34.080
in with a row of Mcducks. That's 22,222 sats. This old duck still got it. Brent, I hope you're

53:34.080 --> 53:39.360
ready for the cottonwood cleanup at the studio. There's still cleanup to do. There is some,

53:39.360 --> 53:44.160
it's much better. Chris. There is some, it's, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine. Um, I'm purging

53:44.160 --> 53:49.680
some of my non JB podcast and I've been thinking about unfollowing any podcaster that does the

53:49.680 --> 53:58.240
dynamically inserted ads. Guys, I'm getting Spanish ads from an English podcaster. Why?

53:59.280 --> 54:03.760
The podcast is okay. I mean, it's no JB. It's okay. But I'm thinking about maybe we should

54:03.760 --> 54:10.880
just start unfollowing the podcasters who have the auto inserted ads. You know, this is, this is

54:10.880 --> 54:14.320
probably going to cause some backlash. People are going to hate this stuff, especially if they're

54:14.320 --> 54:18.880
coming in in a different language. You know, one thing I've noticed since being here at Alex's,

54:18.880 --> 54:23.920
cause he's got all these gizmos is he's got this fancy system on his television that skips ads on

54:23.920 --> 54:29.040
the YouTube, uh, I guess app that he's got on there. Yeah. It's like a separate app. That is

54:29.040 --> 54:35.440
crazy. Cool. I don't quite know how it works on the like, yeah. Tell me how it works. You know,

54:35.440 --> 54:41.280
it's crazy, right? Because I, it even skips like their Patreon plugs. It skips their swag plugs.

54:41.280 --> 54:46.960
It, it skips when they're asking for likes. And of course it skips the ads because it's community

54:47.520 --> 54:53.680
contributed. I, people watch and then that also use this extension or this app and then they

54:53.680 --> 54:56.720
contribute it in real time. And then so by the time you sit down, which, you know, after video

54:56.720 --> 55:00.720
has been up for a little bit, everybody's filled out all the info and you sit down to watch it.

55:00.720 --> 55:04.640
And it just, it glides over all of that stuff. That is amazing. I mean, this is,

55:04.640 --> 55:09.200
if this thing took off, it would screw YouTubers. It really would.

55:09.200 --> 55:11.520
Well, but it, you know, if this keeps up with podcasts,

55:11.520 --> 55:15.600
it might actually come to podcasting as well. And I wonder how that would change things.

55:15.600 --> 55:18.960
That's why you got to be careful. And it's like with these dynamically inserted ads.

55:19.680 --> 55:24.240
The other thing is it's how successful is that ad going to be? How good of an ad is that for

55:24.240 --> 55:28.400
the audience? How good of a fit is it? Like the reason why Linode sponsors the show is because

55:28.400 --> 55:32.960
Linode is a great fit for our audience. Right. And we're users of Linode and that doesn't just

55:32.960 --> 55:36.880
happen accidentally. It's like, we analyze what we use and what we think our audience would use

55:36.880 --> 55:40.800
and what we think is a good company and who we can feel comfortable about recommending.

55:41.360 --> 55:46.480
And then we carefully approach that. And the dynamically inserted ads are the opposite of

55:46.480 --> 55:50.320
that. And it just, yeah, I agree, Brent. It feels like it's going to create backlash.

55:50.320 --> 55:53.600
And here we have Optimus Grey. Sounds like it is creating backlash.

55:53.600 --> 55:59.920
I feel, Chris, like we're so lucky that we are super passionate about our sponsors and have been

55:59.920 --> 56:06.160
able, you know, in great thanks to the memberships and to everyone who sends in memberships. Thank

56:06.160 --> 56:12.640
you. It allows us to be passionate about those ads, you know, although I do have this mattress

56:12.640 --> 56:16.560
that I just got that I want to talk about. We should, we should, we should get into this.

56:16.560 --> 56:20.240
Let's hold on now. We'll talk about this off air. All right. If we can get a mattress,

56:20.240 --> 56:26.080
maybe like some Squarespace and a toothbrush or something, maybe some underwear. No, you know,

56:26.080 --> 56:31.360
I actually am super grateful for the members. And I feel like looking back over the last two and a

56:31.360 --> 56:36.080
half, two years or so when we went independent again, I think launching the memberships might

56:36.080 --> 56:39.360
have been one of the more critical maneuvers we made because it gave us this runway that we find

56:39.360 --> 56:44.960
today. The ad market sucks. And the kind of kind of pitches we're getting from some of these

56:44.960 --> 56:49.440
companies, you guys would never want to hear us do. And so the members have given us that that

56:49.440 --> 56:53.120
insurance policy that we don't even have to be worrying about that right now. And I don't know

56:53.120 --> 56:57.440
how bad things are going to get, but right now we're getting by thanks to our members and,

56:57.440 --> 57:01.840
and also the support from the boosts and other people. It's just, it's just great. It really is.

57:01.840 --> 57:04.960
Yeah. All around. It's great. It's super great. So thanks to everyone.

57:04.960 --> 57:11.360
Cdubs boosted in with 10,101 sats, which is a binary boost. I'm thinking,

57:12.320 --> 57:18.000
and we don't have a binary boost. Yeah. I think that's Morse code. I don't know if that's

57:18.000 --> 57:23.120
binary. What's the difference? Yeah, I guess. Yeah. Um, but we need a binary soundbite, maybe

57:23.120 --> 57:27.520
something from the Binars episode of TNG, but in the meantime, uh, Cdubs, you get a hard drive.

57:32.800 --> 57:37.280
Cdubs also sent this in either using blue CLI or something based around it,

57:37.280 --> 57:43.440
which is super geeky. He says, Bitcoin is not crypto. I sent this from my own note using a

57:43.440 --> 57:47.680
program. I wrote myself using the hardest money ever. Well, that is impressive.

57:47.680 --> 57:52.800
That's the other thing, right? It's a monetary network. It is both a store of value and a way

57:52.800 --> 57:58.080
to it. It is also the remittance and payment network and it's all open source and free and

57:58.080 --> 58:02.720
you can build stuff on top of it just like you can free software and Linux. It is so cool. He says,

58:02.720 --> 58:07.120
I love the fact that there's no visa or PayPal that is selling my purchase history to the highest

58:07.120 --> 58:12.960
bidder. There's no authoritarian that can just say who I can or cannot receive funds or send funds

58:12.960 --> 58:18.000
to. And there's no fed diluting the supply. Let's go Bitcoin and let's go podcasting.

58:21.440 --> 58:25.680
Thank you, Cdubs. Also a big thank you to Gene Bean who sent some LeetSats to say

58:25.680 --> 58:32.160
plus one on the member chat channel ideas. Wooden501 sent in 3.5 thousand sats to say,

58:32.160 --> 58:35.920
hey, uh, don't let the cheap boost die. Well, don't worry. We have a plan, Wooden. Tell us

58:35.920 --> 58:40.720
what you think about the top four. And Trevdev sent in 2.5 thousand sats to say that the boosts

58:40.720 --> 58:45.120
are his favorite way to send feedback. And we got more boosts as well. We just couldn't get to all

58:45.120 --> 58:49.760
of them in the show, but we did try to consolidate the ones that had sort of a shared message and we

58:49.760 --> 58:54.000
one hundred percent read all of them. Thank you, everybody. If you'd like to send a boost into the

58:54.000 --> 58:58.960
show, go to new podcast apps dot com. You can grab a new podcast app there or maybe you don't want

58:58.960 --> 59:02.800
to switch apps. I know like a lot of you is out there. He loves your antenna pod. Well, guess what?

59:02.800 --> 59:07.680
There's Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z dot technology or boost CLI. All of it's listed over at

59:07.680 --> 59:12.720
new podcast apps dot com. That's all you got to do. Grab that. Get yourself going. Don't forget,

59:12.720 --> 59:16.800
we also have the matrix room to participate there. And then last but not least, the thing that you

59:16.800 --> 59:20.720
always got to check out is that Web page where we got the links, the subscribe feed and the contact

59:20.720 --> 59:25.200
form and office hours dot hair. And then Brantley, why don't you give them one good solid plug for

59:25.200 --> 59:28.640
the new website? And then I think we're out of here. Yeah, I'm going to do a plug for Podverse.

59:28.640 --> 59:34.000
I think their embedded player on the on the website has been amazing and you can do some

59:34.000 --> 59:37.920
cool stuff with that thing like chapter support is right there on the Web page, which is awesome.

59:37.920 --> 59:42.640
So if you want to check that out, go to new dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com. Give it a try.

59:42.640 --> 59:48.000
Try to break it and we'll fix it hopefully before launch. Now is the time to dog food. So let us

59:48.000 --> 59:51.760
know what you think. And with that, we're all done. Thank you, everybody, for joining us on

59:51.760 --> 59:56.720
this week's office hours. And that's it. You got to get out of here. I need this room back.

59:56.720 --> 01:00:03.520
The office hours are closed.
