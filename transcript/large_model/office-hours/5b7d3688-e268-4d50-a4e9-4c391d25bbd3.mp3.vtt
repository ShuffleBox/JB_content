WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.700
Well, so far, we're streaming, we're recording, the mixer seems to be working.

00:04.700 --> 00:07.740
It's like we didn't have a massive power outage last night.

00:07.740 --> 00:08.740
Except that you did.

00:08.740 --> 00:09.740
Yeah.

00:09.740 --> 00:10.740
Oh, I hate it.

00:10.740 --> 00:15.460
So I get home last night and I get a message on my phone like such and such system is unreachable,

00:15.460 --> 00:17.700
which is how I know something's gone wrong.

00:17.700 --> 00:22.380
Either the internet is out or the studio doesn't have power.

00:22.380 --> 00:26.300
And do you know what my first thought was when I realized the studio doesn't have power?

00:26.300 --> 00:27.780
No, please tell me.

00:27.780 --> 00:28.780
You're not going to be surprised.

00:28.780 --> 00:30.100
Oh, the node.

00:30.100 --> 00:31.100
The node.

00:31.100 --> 00:32.100
Yeah.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.100
Yeah, the node.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.100
I was like, no.

00:34.100 --> 00:40.260
I think it was in January we were talking about a battery backup for that thing.

00:40.260 --> 00:42.820
I guess you never got that out of your Amazon cart.

00:42.820 --> 00:43.820
Yeah.

00:43.820 --> 00:44.820
I just didn't want to turn it off.

00:44.820 --> 00:46.980
You know, that's the thing at the uptime.

00:46.980 --> 00:51.340
And then of course, when I have forced uptime, all I want to do is get it back online as

00:51.340 --> 00:53.500
fast as freaking possible.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.700
So then it's like, that's not the time, you know, so I got to get it back up because it

00:56.700 --> 01:01.420
went down like at 6 p.m. and I didn't make it to the studio until 7 a.m.

01:01.420 --> 01:05.100
I think power probably came back somewhere around 4 a.m.

01:05.100 --> 01:06.100
That's a lot of downtime.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.100
Yeah.

01:07.100 --> 01:11.900
So I make a beeline to the node worried that maybe some of my channels have been forcibly

01:11.900 --> 01:15.220
closed because if you're offline for too long, it can happen.

01:15.220 --> 01:18.460
Somebody can close their channel to you and then you don't have the inbound liquidity

01:18.460 --> 01:19.460
you need and all that kind of thing.

01:19.460 --> 01:21.060
It's a bad it's a bad deal.

01:21.060 --> 01:27.060
Because as a node, your reputation is in part based on your availability and all of that.

01:27.060 --> 01:29.160
It's you know, the network tracks that kind of stuff.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.420
And so I got that sucker back online.

01:31.420 --> 01:35.820
But because it's an older machine, it took about 20 minutes before everything fully came

01:35.820 --> 01:36.820
back.

01:36.820 --> 01:39.740
It was a nail biting 20 minutes.

01:39.740 --> 01:40.740
And it's like, what do I do?

01:40.740 --> 01:42.620
And I'm running through the scenarios.

01:42.620 --> 01:43.620
What do I do?

01:43.620 --> 01:44.620
What do I do?

01:44.620 --> 01:45.940
So tell me about your backups.

01:45.940 --> 01:47.580
Yeah, I know exactly.

01:47.580 --> 01:48.580
Like check the backups.

01:48.580 --> 01:52.980
You know, grit.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.300
And then then I got the studio working after I got that.

01:55.300 --> 02:01.180
So I see the order of priorities here.

02:01.180 --> 02:05.060
It's office hours with me, Chris.

02:05.060 --> 02:08.500
Hello, everyone.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.900
Welcome back into the office.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.220
Oh, it's nice.

02:11.220 --> 02:13.340
I've been back for a little bit now.

02:13.340 --> 02:15.380
So everything's just the way I like it.

02:15.380 --> 02:17.420
We've made a little bit of a mess over in the corner.

02:17.420 --> 02:18.940
Well, it's not weird.

02:18.940 --> 02:22.540
And I appreciate everybody for making it in and it's going to be a special show today.

02:22.540 --> 02:23.540
Hey, Brantley.

02:23.540 --> 02:24.540
Hello.

02:24.540 --> 02:25.540
Tell me why it's special today.

02:25.540 --> 02:29.060
Well, you got all these penguins in here, which I thought was kind of interesting.

02:29.060 --> 02:30.780
Yeah, they're just they're AI generated.

02:30.780 --> 02:32.980
I have to wear a suit as well.

02:32.980 --> 02:33.980
You were supposed to.

02:33.980 --> 02:35.220
I sent you a memo.

02:35.220 --> 02:37.020
The problem is, is that you're traveling.

02:37.020 --> 02:40.660
So I think it's back at your other office on the other side of Canada.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.660
Right.

02:41.660 --> 02:43.020
We got to get a better system for that.

02:43.020 --> 02:47.980
No, we have a special show today because really, one of the MVPs of the Jupiter Broadcasting

02:47.980 --> 02:49.580
community is joining us today.

02:49.580 --> 02:53.900
You've heard us talk about Elray on the air in context of working on our website.

02:53.900 --> 02:55.860
But Elray joins us today, a.k.a.

02:55.860 --> 02:56.860
Alex.

02:56.860 --> 02:57.860
Hello, Alex.

02:57.860 --> 02:58.860
Welcome in to the office.

02:58.860 --> 02:59.860
It's great to have you here.

02:59.860 --> 03:00.860
Hi.

03:00.860 --> 03:01.860
Thank you.

03:01.860 --> 03:02.860
It's very cozy with all these dogs around.

03:02.860 --> 03:03.860
Yeah.

03:03.860 --> 03:04.860
OK.

03:04.860 --> 03:08.220
There are a few dogs and penguins, I admit.

03:08.220 --> 03:09.500
I like I like it.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.140
I like it to have animals.

03:11.140 --> 03:12.980
It's totally it's snuggly.

03:12.980 --> 03:15.980
It's makes the kids happy, very nice and cozy.

03:15.980 --> 03:20.420
And they've all been trained to be quiet, you know, so there's there's really no downside

03:20.420 --> 03:21.420
to it.

03:21.420 --> 03:22.820
Pretty impressive.

03:22.820 --> 03:24.540
So thank you for joining us, Elray.

03:24.540 --> 03:27.140
I'm looking forward to chatting about the website.

03:27.140 --> 03:31.500
We're going to do a little push to production while we're live today on the show.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.300
We'll tell everybody about that in a little bit.

03:34.300 --> 03:38.980
The early signals are coming in for the big media companies that it's going to be a brutal

03:38.980 --> 03:43.100
winter for media profits, especially in the United States.

03:43.100 --> 03:47.500
So far, nearly three thousand media jobs have been cut this year, with more than one third

03:47.500 --> 03:51.480
coming from the news media industry in particular.

03:51.480 --> 03:58.220
It looks like ad sales for the large media companies are way down viewership as well.

03:58.220 --> 03:59.380
Ad sales down.

03:59.380 --> 04:02.980
I don't know if it's an indication of where the rest of the media market goes, if where

04:02.980 --> 04:06.820
the dinosaurs lead the rest go, or if it's just going to affect the most expensive legacy

04:06.820 --> 04:10.020
media first, that's a bit of a wait and see.

04:10.020 --> 04:15.220
The word that people are using is a chilling in the ad market, which is like a way to say

04:15.220 --> 04:20.320
like demand is like slowing down for ads, which inevitably will will begin to impact

04:20.320 --> 04:21.320
content creators.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.320
OK.

04:22.320 --> 04:26.160
And do you have theories like is it obviously because the economy is down a little bit and

04:26.160 --> 04:29.580
therefore Big Corp doesn't have money to sink into this?

04:29.580 --> 04:31.740
It's everybody's a little feeling a little tight on money, right?

04:31.740 --> 04:34.300
I think everybody has a little less money to spend.

04:34.300 --> 04:39.120
And so probably advertisers aren't getting the results that they want to see consistently

04:39.120 --> 04:40.420
from some of these outlets.

04:40.420 --> 04:45.100
And some of these outlets are very expensive, so they are big cost centers.

04:45.100 --> 04:50.700
And advertising is one of those things that you can kind of quickly cut back on and see

04:50.700 --> 04:51.700
the return.

04:51.700 --> 04:55.020
You know, and without really having to do anything else, you can cut advertising and

04:55.020 --> 04:56.020
save money.

04:56.020 --> 04:57.020
I don't know.

04:57.020 --> 04:58.860
It'll be interesting to see what happens.

04:58.860 --> 05:03.740
I think Adam Curry, the pod father, believes that this is going to develop into probably

05:03.740 --> 05:08.340
a harder and harder time for podcasting and YouTube advertising.

05:08.340 --> 05:10.100
I'm not totally sure of that.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.100
It's definitely possible.

05:11.100 --> 05:16.460
I feel like we're at a fork in the road in in the 2008 financial crisis.

05:16.460 --> 05:20.640
In the last big downturn that I saw, it initially affected podcast advertising.

05:20.640 --> 05:27.660
But the route that advertisers chose was to focus more on independent media and and social

05:27.660 --> 05:31.460
media because it was such a smaller cost.

05:31.460 --> 05:36.820
And so they cut back their advertising on the radio and on television and they began

05:36.820 --> 05:42.580
advertising more on YouTube, podcasts, blogs, and that grew over the years because they

05:42.580 --> 05:46.600
were getting pretty good return for the spend.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.940
They went for the value advertising.

05:48.940 --> 05:52.500
I don't know if that's going to be the case this time around, because now the rates to

05:52.500 --> 05:58.340
advertise on a YouTube channel are outlandish and the lot of podcasts charge outlandish

05:58.340 --> 06:02.700
prices, too, for for their for their sponsorship rates, so I don't know if the and I also don't

06:02.700 --> 06:04.420
know if the situation is the same.

06:04.420 --> 06:09.820
It's a global downturn this time, so that could affect things as well.

06:09.820 --> 06:10.820
I don't know.

06:10.820 --> 06:13.820
I guess this is something I think we should maybe just keep our eye on.

06:13.820 --> 06:14.820
I wouldn't panic.

06:14.820 --> 06:19.440
But I think it's something to keep our eye on because it could affect our friends and

06:19.440 --> 06:23.100
maybe eventually could it could eventually blow back on to JB.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.880
We're pretty far down that stack when you're looking at like CNN and BBC.

06:26.880 --> 06:29.300
We're pretty far down that stack.

06:29.300 --> 06:32.780
I mean, but it is also just a prediction at this point, right?

06:32.780 --> 06:36.620
So as we've seen in the last few years, anything can happen.

06:36.620 --> 06:38.260
Yeah, anything could happen.

06:38.260 --> 06:43.900
And it could also end up being a good thing for value for value podcasts and encouraging

06:43.900 --> 06:48.860
those concepts and pushing people from that were kind of on the fence of, well, I don't

06:48.860 --> 06:52.820
know about that, to kind of maybe switching over to supporting the shows and content they

06:52.820 --> 06:55.500
like and going value for value.

06:55.500 --> 06:59.900
That's actually exactly one of the things that I was going to talk about if I was asked

06:59.900 --> 07:06.340
about it was, for me, giving financially has been difficult, specifically in my what I've

07:06.340 --> 07:11.980
been able to do for my job, but this is the best way that I think I can give back is by

07:11.980 --> 07:16.980
actually doing the technical, helping out with the website, trying to automate scripts

07:16.980 --> 07:23.020
and code and other things, because that's where my acumen is at.

07:23.020 --> 07:27.260
So it's just the easiest way for me to give back.

07:27.260 --> 07:28.780
And it's super valuable.

07:28.780 --> 07:32.260
And now we talk about you all the time on our shows, so look at that.

07:32.260 --> 07:35.220
But it's been great for for JB.

07:35.220 --> 07:39.540
It's been a and probably has been more impactful than a monetary donation would be, unless

07:39.540 --> 07:43.020
it was a significant one that we go hire somebody for a while.

07:43.020 --> 07:44.780
Here's what I think happens.

07:44.780 --> 07:48.260
I think when when these kinds of things happen, you know, however you want to say it, times

07:48.260 --> 07:55.460
get tougher, things change, I think communities that support each other, people turn to that

07:55.460 --> 07:56.460
kind of stuff.

07:56.460 --> 08:00.140
You know, like example is I've noticed my little neighborhood where we usually park

08:00.140 --> 08:04.900
jupes has become a little tighter, you know, we're sharing garden tips and space for some

08:04.900 --> 08:09.620
people and we're keeping an eye on each other's yards and there's a little bit more sharing

08:09.620 --> 08:13.620
than there was a few years ago, pre pandemic and stuff like that.

08:13.620 --> 08:15.340
And that community has become a little bit stronger.

08:15.340 --> 08:21.480
And I feel like value for value is a framework for a bunch of people on the Internet to wrap

08:21.480 --> 08:27.220
their heads around something we can all agree on a common set of ideas to participate.

08:27.220 --> 08:28.280
It's a common language.

08:28.280 --> 08:29.280
It's a common mindset.

08:29.280 --> 08:33.700
So, you know, when I say value for value already interprets that as well, I can't necessarily

08:33.700 --> 08:37.060
contribute financially right now, but I can contribute technical skills.

08:37.060 --> 08:41.020
Somebody else might interpret that as well, I could contribute financially right now because

08:41.020 --> 08:44.900
I don't have the time and somebody else might interpret that as well, I can make a few clips

08:44.900 --> 08:48.440
for the guys to give the boost segments, even more sounds to make it even more dynamic and

08:48.440 --> 08:49.440
keep that flowing.

08:49.440 --> 08:50.440
Right.

08:50.440 --> 08:54.560
And there's just it's a community coming together around something.

08:54.560 --> 09:00.600
The most important aspect of all of it is it keeps the creators.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.300
It keeps them focused on their community.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.580
It keeps them genuine to their community.

09:04.580 --> 09:06.100
It keeps them in touch with their community.

09:06.100 --> 09:08.360
It keeps them grounded, right?

09:08.360 --> 09:14.680
It keeps us talking to real people at working on stuff instead of instead of getting lost

09:14.680 --> 09:18.460
in the echo chamber of social media and Twitter and the and the arguments and the fights and

09:18.460 --> 09:22.620
all of the super polarized things over there or instead of, you know, letting it get to

09:22.620 --> 09:26.380
your head that a million people, four million people, five million people are downloading

09:26.380 --> 09:28.960
your stuff instead of like getting carried away with that stuff.

09:28.960 --> 09:29.960
It keeps you grounded.

09:29.960 --> 09:33.160
It's like more like working, working with the land than it is, you know, working up

09:33.160 --> 09:34.160
in the concept level.

09:34.160 --> 09:39.060
And I think as a content creator, it's really important that you stay grounded, you stay

09:39.060 --> 09:42.760
connected to real people, you stay working in the community.

09:42.760 --> 09:46.740
And value for value is a framework that keeps the creator in that headspace.

09:46.740 --> 09:49.860
It lets people participate in a way they would otherwise not.

09:49.860 --> 09:55.780
And so if there is an economic downturn, I feel like JB is probably well positioned because

09:55.780 --> 09:57.880
we've been talking about these ideas for a while.

09:57.880 --> 10:01.300
We would have to see it increase from where we're at right now in support.

10:01.300 --> 10:04.220
But I actually have a pretty strong sense that our community would step up, those who

10:04.220 --> 10:07.900
could, and they would step up in each way that they are capable of.

10:07.900 --> 10:13.580
So when I see this news about the legacy media struggling, I think that sucks.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.460
I hope it doesn't hurt JB.

10:15.460 --> 10:20.220
I hope it doesn't hurt our friends in this space who rely solely on advertising.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.820
But I think we're going to weather it.

10:22.820 --> 10:25.640
Even if we had to slim down a little bit, depending on how bad it got, like we would

10:25.640 --> 10:29.020
still weather, we would still have that core community support.

10:29.020 --> 10:32.060
So it's also an insurance policy, you know, in a way.

10:32.060 --> 10:37.600
The more we integrate value for value, it's an insurance policy that an economic downturn

10:37.600 --> 10:41.600
can't come in and blow us away and take out what we've built.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.340
It's a stronger foundation.

10:43.340 --> 10:48.940
Yeah, I guess I feel a lot better about it now that I think about it.

10:48.940 --> 10:49.940
So maybe it's good news.

10:49.940 --> 10:50.940
I don't know.

10:50.940 --> 10:54.300
And on that same, on that, did you have anything you wanted to add, Alex?

10:54.300 --> 10:59.260
I was just going to say, you just sometimes have to make sure you set ground rules about

10:59.260 --> 11:03.820
not allowing your neighbor to push away a food order you ordered ahead of time.

11:03.820 --> 11:06.680
Yes, that is true.

11:06.680 --> 11:11.220
To be to be fair to the neighbors, the neighbor's friend, which made it even more obnoxious.

11:11.220 --> 11:12.220
Like, what do you know?

11:12.220 --> 11:13.220
You're just visiting.

11:13.220 --> 11:14.220
What do you know?

11:14.220 --> 11:17.720
That's a big Instacart order, too.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.020
But there is more good news out there.

11:20.020 --> 11:24.160
Recently since we got together on October 19th, Pocket Cast announced that the mobile

11:24.160 --> 11:28.220
apps are going open source.

11:28.220 --> 11:31.940
Pocket Cast is one of the beloved podcast apps out there, so it's really fantastic to

11:31.940 --> 11:33.700
see this.

11:33.700 --> 11:36.700
They launched back in 2010.

11:36.700 --> 11:41.340
And I think there is definitely not a huge portion of our audience, but a significant

11:41.340 --> 11:43.260
portion of our audience who loves Pocket Cast.

11:43.260 --> 11:49.340
So to see Automatic, the folks that also own WordPress, make this announcement, a lot

11:49.340 --> 11:51.660
of people in our audience took note.

11:51.660 --> 11:57.980
Now, I feel like we still have a second shoe to drop here with Pocket Cast.

11:57.980 --> 12:03.320
I think what really makes Pocket Cast tick is its back end infrastructure.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.300
And that's not open source still.

12:06.300 --> 12:10.180
It's also not clear what Pocket Cast intends to do with their index.

12:10.180 --> 12:15.840
If they plan to continue to develop that index, if they want to make it more widely available,

12:15.840 --> 12:21.220
or if they plan to integrate maybe the podcast index and stop maintaining yet another podcast

12:21.220 --> 12:22.220
index.

12:22.220 --> 12:28.980
Obviously, my preference would be they use the podcast index and not their own independent

12:28.980 --> 12:29.980
database.

12:29.980 --> 12:36.020
Also, it's, I think, remains yet to be seen how much they're going to support podcasting

12:36.020 --> 12:37.020
2.0.

12:37.020 --> 12:42.740
Yeah, I definitely think that if they're trying to be more open source oriented, definitely

12:42.740 --> 12:48.140
going with what you're saying would be what they're trying to actually shoot for.

12:48.140 --> 12:53.060
What do you think their incentive was to open source the apps themselves and not really

12:53.060 --> 12:55.900
mention anywhere about the back end?

12:55.900 --> 13:03.060
I wonder, is this part of a long term plan or is this, I'm curious, what do you think

13:03.060 --> 13:04.060
the incentive is here?

13:04.060 --> 13:08.660
Well, you know, the automatic folks generally do publish a lot of their stuff as open source

13:08.660 --> 13:10.140
like WordPress and whatnot.

13:10.140 --> 13:14.940
So there's maybe, you know, maybe this is just the company's culture to a degree.

13:14.940 --> 13:19.460
I think there's also the advantages, as we've seen, if you open up an app to the community

13:19.460 --> 13:22.460
of contributors, they're going to start being able to work on stuff that you just didn't

13:22.460 --> 13:24.260
have the bandwidth for.

13:24.260 --> 13:26.660
And then I think there's also the competitive aspect.

13:26.660 --> 13:29.500
On iOS, Apple Podcast is king.

13:29.500 --> 13:34.360
And then there's a lot of really great alternative podcast apps.

13:34.360 --> 13:39.460
And with the new podcast apps that have come up, there's even more options now.

13:39.460 --> 13:43.020
And something like Podverse, for example, that's GPL.

13:43.020 --> 13:46.020
Something like AntennaPod, also open source.

13:46.020 --> 13:49.460
So you have to figure there was a bit of a competitive analysis they must have done too

13:49.460 --> 13:53.940
as well and thought, well, in order for us to stay relevant, this is the direction we

13:53.940 --> 13:54.940
have to go.

13:54.940 --> 13:57.620
We need these new features added pretty quick.

13:57.620 --> 14:00.700
I do believe they've been chatting with Dave and Adam a bit.

14:00.700 --> 14:05.420
So hopefully that means they're open to the idea of the Podcasting 2.0 stuff.

14:05.420 --> 14:06.420
That would be nice.

14:06.420 --> 14:11.100
I don't know if I've said this publicly, but I've said it privately.

14:11.100 --> 14:16.740
For me, the Podcasting 2.0 features are a matter of competitiveness in a way, right?

14:16.740 --> 14:21.620
Like it's a way you could look at it is a podcast is a product and that product needs

14:21.620 --> 14:24.940
to be as good as possible.

14:24.940 --> 14:31.020
And I've always prided on JB featuring the cutting edge stuff that podcasting has available

14:31.020 --> 14:33.040
whenever whenever there is something.

14:33.040 --> 14:37.700
Maybe it's I mean, for a long time, we just pushed having video versions available that

14:37.700 --> 14:38.700
most people weren't doing.

14:38.700 --> 14:42.640
And then after that, it's silly things like pushing the edge of what you can do with an

14:42.640 --> 14:44.460
encoded file and embedding chapters.

14:44.460 --> 14:49.300
And then we would take things further and further just because we have an audience that

14:49.300 --> 14:50.300
frankly likes that stuff.

14:50.300 --> 14:51.620
You know, they know how to use that stuff.

14:51.620 --> 14:52.840
They have tooling for that stuff.

14:52.840 --> 14:53.840
They want it.

14:53.840 --> 15:01.300
So let's go and podcasting 2.0 and all of the options in there, like alternative enclosures,

15:01.300 --> 15:09.500
host information, transcripts, cloud chapters, live tag, value for value, so on and so forth

15:09.500 --> 15:15.280
are, in my opinion, features I want our shows to have and they make our shows more competitive.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.340
They make them more feature complete.

15:17.340 --> 15:23.780
And so as a podcaster, I'm going to be talking about the apps that make my shows shine and

15:23.780 --> 15:28.700
I'm not going to be talking about the apps as much that don't because I don't think there's

15:28.700 --> 15:30.880
as good of an experience over there.

15:30.880 --> 15:35.640
And so when you think about the fact that apps that have podcasting 2.0 features are

15:35.640 --> 15:40.940
basically getting free advertising on every podcast that's implementing podcasting 2.0

15:40.940 --> 15:45.340
features, it'd be a pretty good idea for Pocket Cast to include those features because then

15:45.340 --> 15:49.660
you're just going to get mentioned across a whole array of podcasts and a lot of them

15:49.660 --> 15:54.340
are like the cutting edge podcasts that follow the latest trends that are doing the new stuff.

15:54.340 --> 15:58.380
Not that we're like some hipster podcast company thing, but I want to have that stuff.

15:58.380 --> 15:59.420
I want to have transcripts.

15:59.420 --> 16:01.060
I want to have cloud chapters.

16:01.060 --> 16:02.820
I want to have an alternative enclosure.

16:02.820 --> 16:05.200
I mean, we have MP4 versions.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.500
We can make Opus versions.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.180
There's a lot we could do with that.

16:08.180 --> 16:13.380
And then at the same time, it's always better for the user or client experience whenever

16:13.380 --> 16:16.700
it's all integrated into the actual app.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.100
It's always more enjoyable.

16:18.100 --> 16:22.100
Like you said, you've been giving them free advertising, but it also makes people want

16:22.100 --> 16:24.580
to listen to your podcast more too.

16:24.580 --> 16:25.580
I hope so.

16:25.580 --> 16:28.900
I think it's silly that we've been sending people outside the podcast app for so many

16:28.900 --> 16:29.900
years.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.780
You just haven't had the option of having that stuff in there.

16:32.780 --> 16:35.580
You want to listen live, go to somewhere else outside your podcast app.

16:35.580 --> 16:38.220
You want to contribute, go somewhere else outside your podcast app.

16:38.220 --> 16:40.340
It's so crazy when you think about it.

16:40.340 --> 16:42.660
Nobody else would do that.

16:42.660 --> 16:47.100
Ever since I had moved to Podverse, every time you guys had mentioned me on a show,

16:47.100 --> 16:48.100
I always clip it.

16:48.100 --> 16:54.140
And then I can send it to my dad or my wife or anyone, and they can see me getting referenced

16:54.140 --> 16:55.140
on a podcast.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.100
So it's been really awesome.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.900
This is going to be a long clip then.

16:59.900 --> 17:01.940
Yeah.

17:01.940 --> 17:05.420
The beautiful thing about clips too, and that's a feature I should mention more often, is

17:05.420 --> 17:06.420
it helps with discovery.

17:06.420 --> 17:07.420
Right?

17:07.420 --> 17:10.780
Like say that was a show on a topic that a family member was interested in.

17:10.780 --> 17:11.780
You could send them a quick clip.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.460
Look what these people are saying about this topic you're interested in, and then they

17:14.460 --> 17:15.460
could become a listener.

17:15.460 --> 17:19.300
I used to have a hack around that for the old Castbox app that I had.

17:19.300 --> 17:25.540
I would, in the Castbox app, create a comment with a timestamp, and then I would send that

17:25.540 --> 17:31.460
link to someone else, and they'd click the timestamp to jump to the specific spot that

17:31.460 --> 17:34.380
I was trying to tell them about.

17:34.380 --> 17:40.940
Yeah, I've certainly used firesides, like I guess on their web instance, they have a

17:40.940 --> 17:42.620
means of doing timestamping as well.

17:42.620 --> 17:45.100
It's a little clumsy, but it works.

17:45.100 --> 17:52.140
Chris that gets me thinking about, I think you've been hoping for us to do some RSS feed

17:52.140 --> 17:53.140
generation.

17:53.140 --> 17:56.540
I don't want to jump to the website too soon, but I just want to ask you, do you have an

17:56.540 --> 17:59.460
idea of time frame that you'd love to have that feature?

17:59.460 --> 18:00.460
Hmm.

18:00.460 --> 18:05.180
Well, I mean, if I were going to like wave a magic wand, I'd like to have it ready for

18:05.180 --> 18:07.020
office hours 16.

18:07.020 --> 18:09.300
But I don't think we're there yet.

18:09.300 --> 18:12.340
Because Wes and I, every time we talk about it, we discover a lot more we have to figure

18:12.340 --> 18:13.340
out.

18:13.340 --> 18:16.240
But I actually think we have it pretty well figured out at this point.

18:16.240 --> 18:21.700
The issue is, once we start generating our own RSS feed, we're basically off fireside.

18:21.700 --> 18:27.200
We're using them for the CDN, but we could point at another CDN, and we're basically

18:27.200 --> 18:28.540
done with fireside.

18:28.540 --> 18:33.540
And so then that brings up the issue of, well, crap, the whole website works by generating

18:33.540 --> 18:35.460
off of what we post on fireside.

18:35.460 --> 18:40.700
So we're trying to figure out a way to do it in a staged approach where, well, we'll

18:40.700 --> 18:43.500
keep fireside in the loop for a while.

18:43.500 --> 18:48.240
We'll take the feed that fireside generates as like the base feed, then we'll generate

18:48.240 --> 18:53.020
on top of that the additional tags that we want, because we're going to probably also

18:53.020 --> 18:59.300
add our own JB namespace tags so we can have information that the website might need that

18:59.300 --> 19:01.140
maybe gets from fireside right now and other things.

19:01.140 --> 19:05.820
So eventually, we could pull all that info that the website needs to generate from just

19:05.820 --> 19:07.940
the RSS feed of the show.

19:07.940 --> 19:14.100
But so initially, it'll be, we'll keep fireside, we'll take fireside's feed, we'll consume

19:14.100 --> 19:18.260
that, generate our own feed with our own stuff, like the podcasting 2.0 namespace stuff in

19:18.260 --> 19:21.420
there, and then put that up on a CDN.

19:21.420 --> 19:24.820
Then when we're ready, when everything's ready to be flipped public in the publishing pipeline,

19:24.820 --> 19:26.440
the feed will flip public.

19:26.440 --> 19:27.440
Maybe we'll do a pod ping.

19:27.440 --> 19:28.440
We'll have to look into that.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.580
I don't know exactly how that works.

19:29.580 --> 19:33.020
And then slowly but surely, we'll just fade out the fireside portion, and we'll just generate

19:33.020 --> 19:36.160
the entire feed ourselves, but we can do it in a staged approach, because we also need

19:36.160 --> 19:37.160
to solve a CDN.

19:37.160 --> 19:41.540
We have to figure out what we want to do for a CDN, and we also have to make sure that

19:41.540 --> 19:45.620
the website can be generated from the feed instead of fireside.

19:45.620 --> 19:52.300
And you know, I hate to do it, because fireside's a pretty good product, and it's a good price,

19:52.300 --> 19:58.020
except for LUP pays a sneaky private rate that they don't tell you about, unless you

19:58.020 --> 20:03.180
get bonkers downloads, and then they contact you, and you have to pay a bonkers price.

20:03.180 --> 20:06.740
So LUP doesn't get a great price, but all the other shows pay a pretty good price for

20:06.740 --> 20:12.020
the amount of downloads we get, and downloads are really fast, in my opinion.

20:12.020 --> 20:16.580
I feel like the MP3s just slam onto my phone when I go to listen.

20:16.580 --> 20:18.340
I love that.

20:18.340 --> 20:23.300
And it's been pretty good, but it's been really unreliable recently.

20:23.300 --> 20:29.180
Coderadio didn't publish on time this week, because fireside had a mistake.

20:29.180 --> 20:33.620
We had an error, like three weeks in a row, Coderadio's been hit.

20:33.620 --> 20:37.100
Linux Action News has been hit a few weeks in a row, too, where it just doesn't publish

20:37.100 --> 20:40.460
on time, because it gets hung up on their system.

20:40.460 --> 20:46.580
And then, I think the part that is the final, like, we've got to get rid of fireside, is

20:46.580 --> 20:50.360
we put a request in about it for them to address it, and it sometimes takes them three to four

20:50.360 --> 20:52.820
days before they get back to us.

20:52.820 --> 20:57.240
Now imagine if we just waited three to four days for a show to publish.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.860
Everybody would think the show's gone.

20:59.860 --> 21:04.100
You know, they think something happened.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.780
It would be ridiculous, not to mention, you know, it wouldn't perform properly for the

21:06.780 --> 21:07.780
sponsors.

21:07.780 --> 21:08.780
It's crazy.

21:08.780 --> 21:09.780
It's suicide.

21:09.780 --> 21:13.420
It'd be different if it was kind of like a side hobby thing, but you're a business.

21:13.420 --> 21:16.580
That's not typically how businesses get treated.

21:16.580 --> 21:21.020
And it's not what we'd expect when, you know, you're paying for a monthly service, and part

21:21.020 --> 21:22.020
of that is support.

21:22.020 --> 21:23.180
Especially at the bonkers price.

21:23.180 --> 21:25.340
Although it doesn't seem to happen as much on Love.

21:25.340 --> 21:30.500
Well now you know why.

21:30.500 --> 21:31.500
Go figure, right?

21:31.500 --> 21:32.500
I guess.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.820
If only they had a network membership then.

21:34.820 --> 21:35.820
Yeah.

21:35.820 --> 21:36.820
Yeah.

21:36.820 --> 21:39.540
That's the other thing, is there's features that have been promised literally before we

21:39.540 --> 21:44.380
merged with Linux Academy in 2019 that we're still waiting on, or 2018, whenever that was.

21:44.380 --> 21:45.480
I can't remember.

21:45.480 --> 21:49.320
But basically, years now, we've been waiting on like a network page.

21:49.320 --> 21:52.780
That's why we stalled the building of the new website for a while, is because we were

21:52.780 --> 21:55.900
told that they would be generating a network page.

21:55.900 --> 21:59.960
You could put all your shows into a network, and then it would create a homepage for all

21:59.960 --> 22:00.960
your shows.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.060
And we're like, well, okay, that'll be great.

22:02.060 --> 22:04.700
That's exactly what we want.

22:04.700 --> 22:05.700
And it never came.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.020
And it never came.

22:07.020 --> 22:08.280
And then we just finally gave up.

22:08.280 --> 22:11.620
And then we got the word from Scale Engine, that hey, we're shutting down your WordPress.

22:11.620 --> 22:14.180
We're like, well, this is quite the pickle.

22:14.180 --> 22:18.020
So now we're kind of there with the hosting aspect.

22:18.020 --> 22:22.100
I don't think we're going to jump immediately, but I think we're building towards that.

22:22.100 --> 22:27.260
And it was just kind of working all of that out, and what it all affects, and what it

22:27.260 --> 22:28.780
really means for us.

22:28.780 --> 22:33.100
And the tooling we'll have to build on the back end, because Fireside has a UI we use,

22:33.100 --> 22:34.100
and things like that.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.820
But we'll get there.

22:35.820 --> 22:37.420
We can do it in pieces.

22:37.420 --> 22:41.860
It's interesting to hear you talk about the publishing side of things, because I didn't

22:41.860 --> 22:47.020
know how do you author whenever a new podcast is going to come out?

22:47.020 --> 22:48.300
Do you schedule it?

22:48.300 --> 22:50.700
It sounds like you do, now that you've mentioned it.

22:50.700 --> 22:56.780
And then how can we build the website around that flow to help enable you be able to still

22:56.780 --> 23:01.380
use the new website, but then also take advantage of all the different features that you're

23:01.380 --> 23:02.380
wanting?

23:02.380 --> 23:06.340
So I imagine, we'll see, is, well, this is still up in the air.

23:06.340 --> 23:09.300
But one option we will have is sort of, we have show docs, right?

23:09.300 --> 23:15.080
Like this episode that we're recording right now has a markdown document that we construct

23:15.080 --> 23:20.080
in HedgeDoc that contains an outline of roughly what we want to talk about today and a few

23:20.080 --> 23:23.820
other extra information, like your Twitter profile link and your GitHub profiling, things

23:23.820 --> 23:26.060
that are just metadata for the show.

23:26.060 --> 23:28.920
And so we kind of have everything we need for the show post in there.

23:28.920 --> 23:33.220
What we're missing is just a few bits of information that we could put in there in some sort of

23:33.220 --> 23:38.740
structure, like episode title, episode date, in a structured way that something could read.

23:38.740 --> 23:43.140
And then our thinking is that what we'll do is upload that to the GitHub repo.

23:43.140 --> 23:45.140
That'll be a repo probably for this.

23:45.140 --> 23:49.500
And once it's in that repo, like a GitHub action kicks off and begins the whole process

23:49.500 --> 23:50.500
there.

23:50.500 --> 23:53.620
Or maybe either the website gets built from that.

23:53.620 --> 23:59.060
There's also something like we could generate a website, the website stuff too, from that

23:59.060 --> 24:00.060
information possibly.

24:00.060 --> 24:01.780
We could just do the generation from that information.

24:01.780 --> 24:06.020
The other option is we just publish the RSS feed and the RSS feed gets updated and the

24:06.020 --> 24:07.220
website generates off of that too.

24:07.220 --> 24:12.980
So probably you, Alex, me, Brent, and Wes probably just all jump on a call at some point

24:12.980 --> 24:18.940
and hash some of that out, you know, kick around a few ideas because we're pretty flexible.

24:18.940 --> 24:21.900
And Wes could pretty much build anything we need on the back end to accommodate it.

24:21.900 --> 24:22.900
So true.

24:22.900 --> 24:26.300
We have good options.

24:26.300 --> 24:31.920
You know, Dementor here in the live chat mentions, hey, Chris, why don't you do a Kickstarter

24:31.920 --> 24:36.900
or something to build an open source version of Fireside?

24:36.900 --> 24:38.500
We've heard this come up a few times.

24:38.500 --> 24:43.140
Yeah, I think, you know, the way you would do that, right, is build it out for JB, make

24:43.140 --> 24:44.140
it work.

24:44.140 --> 24:51.220
And then it'd be another project to like identify what would have to be changed to make it portable.

24:51.220 --> 24:53.860
And you know, you swap out, you swap out art, swap out names.

24:53.860 --> 24:56.580
Like what would have to be changed to make that accomplished?

24:56.580 --> 24:59.820
And then figure out from there what kind of a project we're looking at.

24:59.820 --> 25:03.660
And if that's even something that would cost us anything, if it's worth raising funds for

25:03.660 --> 25:08.420
like, you know, that would be down the road because it's very technical at the moment.

25:08.420 --> 25:12.180
We'd have to string a lot of different technologies together because we're using a lot of different

25:12.180 --> 25:14.220
primitives together to build what we want.

25:14.220 --> 25:19.860
We're not creating all the tools, but we're sure stringing a lot of tools together, essentially.

25:19.860 --> 25:21.340
Yeah.

25:21.340 --> 25:27.060
And that's actually the way you were talking about like authoring content and those other

25:27.060 --> 25:28.060
things.

25:28.060 --> 25:31.920
It makes it really tricky because you don't, I'm sure you guys don't want to share the

25:31.920 --> 25:35.500
information too soon before the actual episode drops.

25:35.500 --> 25:41.980
But if you didn't have that concern, it could all just be inside of GitHub and like a statically

25:41.980 --> 25:48.780
hosted CMS or a serverless CMS, which is just, you host it on the actual website and it's

25:48.780 --> 25:51.220
static and you just log into it.

25:51.220 --> 25:56.780
And it transparently creates pull requests and other things based on your identity in

25:56.780 --> 26:02.340
GitHub, which would be where you could add all those extra specific tags that you want

26:02.340 --> 26:04.420
to for each post.

26:04.420 --> 26:06.540
But it also has to look into your tooling.

26:06.540 --> 26:12.380
So there's solutions around what you guys are talking about.

26:12.380 --> 26:15.820
It's just trying to figure out the best way to put it all together and what enables you

26:15.820 --> 26:16.820
the most.

26:16.820 --> 26:23.480
And I think what we'll do, and maybe inevitably, is start with office hours as a bit of a let's

26:23.480 --> 26:24.480
try this approach.

26:24.480 --> 26:27.700
I'll probably come on here and be like, okay, we've got a new feed.

26:27.700 --> 26:31.820
If you want to try out the new feed, go subscribe over here and let's see how it works.

26:31.820 --> 26:36.540
And then if we get that working, we'll probably try to figure it out for everything else from

26:36.540 --> 26:37.540
there.

26:37.540 --> 26:38.540
Because office hours is kind of the test.

26:38.540 --> 26:40.620
It'd be a great time to rename the show, too.

26:40.620 --> 26:42.860
So like if you subscribe to the new feed, you get the new name.

26:42.860 --> 26:44.820
And if you're on the old feed, you got the old name.

26:44.820 --> 26:45.820
That'd be weird.

26:45.820 --> 26:47.380
That's how you bait people into switching.

26:47.380 --> 26:48.380
Maybe.

26:48.380 --> 26:51.060
Let's say give them more incentive.

26:51.060 --> 26:53.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe.

26:53.020 --> 26:54.020
All right.

26:54.020 --> 26:55.140
Well, we will figure it out.

26:55.140 --> 26:56.800
We have more website stuff to get to.

26:56.800 --> 27:02.220
So before we get there, I want to thank Linode for sponsoring this episode of office hours.

27:02.220 --> 27:05.980
Linode.com slash Jupiter to get $100 credit for 60 days on a new account.

27:05.980 --> 27:07.980
It's a great way to try things out.

27:07.980 --> 27:10.340
We run our whole website infrastructure on there.

27:10.340 --> 27:12.940
Everything we're talking about, let's build and it's running on Linode.

27:12.940 --> 27:17.900
You know what else we run over there that I don't mention as much, but it has been absolutely

27:17.900 --> 27:21.340
100% rock solid.

27:21.340 --> 27:24.020
We use Linode for video streaming as well.

27:24.020 --> 27:27.820
Pyrotube runs on Linode and I am very impressed.

27:27.820 --> 27:34.660
They have plans specifically for streaming as well with really generous bandwidth plans,

27:34.660 --> 27:38.860
transparent pricing, making it super easy for you to get things set up and running.

27:38.860 --> 27:42.840
They have a couple of different open source projects, video streaming and audio like radio

27:42.840 --> 27:43.840
station style, too.

27:43.840 --> 27:50.260
If you want to be an internet DJ, I've been floored, absolutely floored at what our Pyrotube

27:50.260 --> 27:51.780
instance has been able to handle.

27:51.780 --> 27:56.740
Of course, recently on Linux Unplugged, we deployed one of their cloud GPU rigs.

27:56.740 --> 27:57.740
That was fun.

27:57.740 --> 28:02.000
You know, if you're just an individual, you want a blog or a gaming server, Linode's great

28:02.000 --> 28:03.000
for that as well.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.920
They make it super simple to get started.

28:04.920 --> 28:08.220
Maybe you've been doing this for 20 years, maybe it's your first server.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.620
You're going to be able to figure it out.

28:09.620 --> 28:12.020
You get over there, you'll figure it out.

28:12.020 --> 28:15.020
And with that $100, you can actually really try something.

28:15.020 --> 28:17.980
Maybe deploy one of their systems and set up a snapshot and a backup and get a sense

28:17.980 --> 28:18.980
of what that's like.

28:18.980 --> 28:22.380
Get an idea of how fast it is to copy things around.

28:22.380 --> 28:26.460
Maybe go deploy your own media server, you know, like they have a jellyfin one click

28:26.460 --> 28:27.460
deployment.

28:27.460 --> 28:29.660
Go try it out.

28:29.660 --> 28:32.660
Linode.com slash Jupiter.

28:32.660 --> 28:33.660
That's where you go.

28:33.660 --> 28:36.700
Simple, affordable and accessible to everyone.

28:36.700 --> 28:38.700
Linode.com slash Jupiter.

28:38.700 --> 28:43.460
All right, so let's get into the website, gentlemen.

28:43.460 --> 28:44.460
You ready?

28:44.460 --> 28:45.460
Do you want to do a live deployment?

28:45.460 --> 28:50.820
And I think the way we should do this is first tell everybody what it is we're deploying

28:50.820 --> 28:54.700
and maybe while we're doing that, get it ready because we're doing it all live.

28:54.700 --> 28:58.620
But who would like to take on the job of explaining what we're about to deploy and why it's super

28:58.620 --> 28:59.620
shiny?

28:59.620 --> 29:02.980
And if you're watching live, pretty soon you'll be able to refresh and see it in real time.

29:02.980 --> 29:04.980
I feel like Elray should take this one.

29:04.980 --> 29:05.980
All right.

29:05.980 --> 29:10.460
Elray, the guest of the show, tell us about this work and has it mostly all been yourself

29:10.460 --> 29:12.260
as well that has been doing it?

29:12.260 --> 29:13.260
Definitely not.

29:13.260 --> 29:16.700
I appreciate the early congratulations.

29:16.700 --> 29:21.580
But I've helped out a little bit from some of the PRs and added a few features.

29:21.580 --> 29:23.260
But should we give some shout outs?

29:23.260 --> 29:25.420
Yeah, I actually have a bunch of shout outs.

29:25.420 --> 29:26.420
OK.

29:26.420 --> 29:27.420
All right.

29:27.420 --> 29:28.420
Good, good, good.

29:28.420 --> 29:30.020
But I didn't I didn't realize you had a flow.

29:30.020 --> 29:31.020
I like it.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.780
I just want to make sure we give credit where credit is due.

29:32.780 --> 29:34.140
No, I appreciate it.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.140
Thank you.

29:35.140 --> 29:36.360
Because it's important.

29:36.360 --> 29:39.940
We changed the default branch for the GitHub repo.

29:39.940 --> 29:42.100
Well, Brent did.

29:42.100 --> 29:46.020
Changed the default branch from main to develop.

29:46.020 --> 29:52.340
And if anyone else is familiar with the technology called Git flow, that's kind of the mechanism

29:52.340 --> 29:53.940
as to how we're going to be merging.

29:53.940 --> 29:59.300
So people create feature branches or forks off of the actual main repo.

29:59.300 --> 30:03.860
They merge to develop and then develop, then gets merged into main.

30:03.860 --> 30:09.580
And so in this particular instance, we're taking all of the changes that have been batched

30:09.580 --> 30:13.500
up from I think it's probably the last office hours.

30:13.500 --> 30:18.380
And we're taking all those changes and we're going to be synchronizing it over to main.

30:18.380 --> 30:23.460
And specifically, the Jupyter broadcasting repo is actually a little bit different.

30:23.460 --> 30:28.940
Because typically, that is the only way people commit is that you go from feature branch

30:28.940 --> 30:31.900
to develop to main.

30:31.900 --> 30:36.340
Since Jupyter broadcasting needs to have a little bit of a different workflow, whenever

30:36.340 --> 30:42.340
new episodes get released, it's important that the main branch continues to get updates

30:42.340 --> 30:44.580
of the new episodes that are released.

30:44.580 --> 30:49.620
So that's been a bit of a tricky issue that we're trying to still figure out.

30:49.620 --> 30:55.860
CG base player had caught it and submitted an issue initially, I had noticed it but hadn't

30:55.860 --> 30:56.860
submitted it.

30:56.860 --> 30:58.740
So that's still something we're figuring out.

30:58.740 --> 31:05.260
But for now, just merging directly from develop to main, even with those extra commits works

31:05.260 --> 31:06.460
perfectly fine.

31:06.460 --> 31:08.620
Well, typically does.

31:08.620 --> 31:12.900
You're updating the production site, but you don't want to push the changes and you also

31:12.900 --> 31:16.580
have to put those same changes on the development site like a new episode.

31:16.580 --> 31:21.620
So that is yeah, probably hard not to sneak in changes and updates, I would imagine with

31:21.620 --> 31:23.100
that setup.

31:23.100 --> 31:30.860
It's been a bit of a funny change of mentality, I think, because now there are a few different

31:30.860 --> 31:33.220
things happening in different places.

31:33.220 --> 31:41.500
Like for instance, the scraper that goes and grabs information off a fireside at this time,

31:41.500 --> 31:48.420
every time we publish a new episode, that is still committing its changes and updates

31:48.420 --> 31:49.860
to the main branch.

31:49.860 --> 31:51.780
So that hasn't really even changed.

31:51.780 --> 31:57.580
But what that means is that this development branch that we have is kind of outdated in

31:57.580 --> 32:01.860
terms of the episodes because they don't ever really show up there.

32:01.860 --> 32:03.740
But that's not really why we have it.

32:03.740 --> 32:08.580
We have this development branch to integrate new features and be able to test them there

32:08.580 --> 32:11.380
before we push them to the actual main website.

32:11.380 --> 32:17.300
And I think it's a maybe a maturing of the way that we are developing the website because

32:17.300 --> 32:23.740
previously we were sort of pushing every single change to the development site whenever we

32:23.740 --> 32:28.980
decided to merge it and that was a little risky and we did run into a few issues that

32:28.980 --> 32:32.500
needed some quick fixing, you know?

32:32.500 --> 32:36.220
Running with scissors, as they say, my friend, it's great, you know?

32:36.220 --> 32:38.260
Nothing's faster than just publishing straight to production.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.260
Yeah, no.

32:39.260 --> 32:43.700
I was about to say, I might have been the cause for some of those issues a few times.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.500
I think we all have been.

32:45.500 --> 32:47.180
Yeah, no, it's good.

32:47.180 --> 32:48.180
I agree.

32:48.180 --> 32:52.540
Having a test branch, having a development branch is a really good idea.

32:52.540 --> 32:55.340
But I guess it's a pretty big change to make after the fact.

32:55.340 --> 32:57.900
It probably would have been easier to start that way, I suppose.

32:57.900 --> 33:00.060
Yeah, I think, hmm, I wonder.

33:00.060 --> 33:06.940
For me, it was easier to start the other way, only because I was new to GitHub.

33:06.940 --> 33:11.220
And I feel like maybe for some new contributors, that was also the case.

33:11.220 --> 33:15.580
But I wonder, Alray, for you, if you have a different opinion there.

33:15.580 --> 33:21.180
The easiest way to get the most amount of impact is the most important thing to start

33:21.180 --> 33:22.180
out with.

33:22.180 --> 33:29.220
So I think while in theory, doing a develop branch first and doing the whole Git flow

33:29.220 --> 33:34.060
workflow is easier, long term.

33:34.060 --> 33:38.860
But if it's harder to start out with, then it's more important for you to actually start

33:38.860 --> 33:39.860
out with.

33:39.860 --> 33:46.380
We had started discussing the idea of essentially having a more mature deployment strategy once

33:46.380 --> 33:48.020
we did start to have issues.

33:48.020 --> 33:53.500
And so the community has been slowly expanding its maturity for the project in general.

33:53.500 --> 33:58.300
And I think having the community grow with the project has been a really awesome experience

33:58.300 --> 34:02.780
just to be able to actually enjoy and see people mature.

34:02.780 --> 34:04.620
It's been neat from our vantage point as well.

34:04.620 --> 34:09.420
So what we're publishing today while we're live is this structural change.

34:09.420 --> 34:11.260
And is there new things also going live?

34:11.260 --> 34:14.580
We're taking from the development branch and taking some of that stuff and actually sending

34:14.580 --> 34:15.780
it out to production today?

34:15.780 --> 34:17.180
Is that what's happening?

34:17.180 --> 34:21.140
Well, we have already implemented that change.

34:21.140 --> 34:27.700
So people have been committing their new pull requests to the develop branch for what about

34:27.700 --> 34:28.700
two weeks now?

34:28.700 --> 34:31.820
I think since the last office hours ish.

34:31.820 --> 34:32.820
Maybe even longer than that.

34:32.820 --> 34:37.620
It might have been there was a bit of a hairy period there where everyone was a little confused

34:37.620 --> 34:40.220
and we had to do some finicky work.

34:40.220 --> 34:44.120
But now it's just like, you don't even think about it, you know, someone putting a new

34:44.120 --> 34:48.300
commit and it just defaults to the place it should go and it has been working well.

34:48.300 --> 34:54.060
There is, it does mean there's an extra step, which is that from time to time, we as the

34:54.060 --> 35:00.620
maintainers need to synchronize all of the new PRS that we've merged and accepted.

35:00.620 --> 35:03.860
We need to synchronize those to production.

35:03.860 --> 35:07.220
Because otherwise, they're just sitting there in that develop branch, not doing anything.

35:07.220 --> 35:12.100
And so that's what we're doing today is we're taking a number of pull requests that have

35:12.100 --> 35:18.300
come in in the last two weeks and pushing it to production.

35:18.300 --> 35:19.300
Are we ready?

35:19.300 --> 35:22.720
Well, it kind of freaks me out because there are something like 74 commits and typically

35:22.720 --> 35:25.140
that makes me very uncomfortable.

35:25.140 --> 35:28.580
So if it's going to break, it'll be spectacular if it breaks.

35:28.580 --> 35:29.580
Yeah, absolutely.

35:29.580 --> 35:33.940
And it's from you know, if you just browse quickly, there are many different authors

35:33.940 --> 35:34.940
in here.

35:34.940 --> 35:39.740
And for me, that's kind of a new way to look at things because I'm used to like a pull

35:39.740 --> 35:46.340
request, typically having one author, maybe another offers author sneaked in there and

35:46.340 --> 35:47.740
added a little change.

35:47.740 --> 35:49.700
But to see, you know, it's smart.

35:49.700 --> 35:54.260
I mean, it's tagged as a piece of cake seems that's makes it sound simple.

35:54.260 --> 35:55.260
What could go wrong?

35:55.260 --> 36:00.820
I think that seems a little deceiving, doesn't it?

36:00.820 --> 36:03.420
I feel like I feel like we should do it.

36:03.420 --> 36:06.940
Well, it is true that all of this has already been vetted.

36:06.940 --> 36:11.340
And there's been some amazing conversation happening in each pull request.

36:11.340 --> 36:13.320
And it has already been tested and everything.

36:13.320 --> 36:16.820
So in theory, when I hit merge, it should just work.

36:16.820 --> 36:18.900
But I, you know, I'm always hesitant.

36:18.900 --> 36:19.900
So I'm just gonna hit it.

36:19.900 --> 36:20.900
Here we go.

36:20.900 --> 36:21.900
Confirming.

36:21.900 --> 36:22.900
Success.

36:22.900 --> 36:23.900
All right.

36:23.900 --> 36:34.980
Now it should, it'll take a little bit to deploy, but we'll test it in a sec.

36:34.980 --> 36:36.220
Yeah, it's got to build now.

36:36.220 --> 36:37.220
It's got to build.

36:37.220 --> 36:41.580
So in about a minute or two, we should have a new website update.

36:41.580 --> 36:43.660
So that's kind of exciting.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.100
I'm looking forward to it.

36:45.100 --> 36:48.900
And it means that the updates to the website are actually quite large.

36:48.900 --> 36:51.960
Like there's a there are several features that will be added at a time.

36:51.960 --> 36:54.060
So you can almost see it as like a point release or something.

36:54.060 --> 36:55.760
So it's kind of exciting.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.460
We have had some cool features land.

36:57.460 --> 37:00.300
Should we chat about those a little bit while we wait for it to build?

37:00.300 --> 37:02.700
Is there any that jump out to you, Alex?

37:02.700 --> 37:05.100
I actually was able to commit.

37:05.100 --> 37:12.340
One of the main reasons why we had started to switch over from the only main branch to

37:12.340 --> 37:17.660
using the develop is that and it's still a work in progress for everyone else.

37:17.660 --> 37:24.500
But all of the changes that we now merge into develop actually go to a deploy preview.

37:24.500 --> 37:29.380
And so we're able to see all the changes visually from the repo be built out on a third party

37:29.380 --> 37:34.580
site and actually be able to audit them from there.

37:34.580 --> 37:41.100
So we're still working on it worked on my repository, of course, for some reason, whenever

37:41.100 --> 37:46.740
we tried to implement it on the main JB website repository, it's no longer working.

37:46.740 --> 37:53.620
But we are working on making it to where all PRS actually get their own deploy preview

37:53.620 --> 37:54.860
instance.

37:54.860 --> 37:59.280
So that way, whenever people are reviewing PRS, they can just click on the deploy preview

37:59.280 --> 38:04.900
link and be able to actually see the visual changes before they approve or accept it.

38:04.900 --> 38:10.940
Currently, we're having to do it a bit more archaically to where we pull it down and review

38:10.940 --> 38:14.460
each individual change manually on our local machines.

38:14.460 --> 38:19.820
So it'll be a nice adjustment once that actually gets fully working.

38:19.820 --> 38:23.060
That sounds like it'll make things a little quicker.

38:23.060 --> 38:27.060
I noticed, too, something that we really appreciated because we didn't even really ask for it.

38:27.060 --> 38:30.460
But yet it landed was the automated sponsor page work.

38:30.460 --> 38:34.500
This is the kind of stuff that is a great example of just making the JB workflow smoother

38:34.500 --> 38:35.780
behind the scenes.

38:35.780 --> 38:38.060
And we didn't have to do anything.

38:38.060 --> 38:39.060
This is great.

38:39.060 --> 38:40.660
It was just this was chance that did this.

38:40.660 --> 38:42.660
That's what I wanted to do.

38:42.660 --> 38:48.580
I shout out the chance this PR specifically whenever he started it and he did an actual

38:48.580 --> 38:49.580
pull request.

38:49.580 --> 38:53.160
I was like, wow, this is really amazing.

38:53.160 --> 38:58.140
He actually had done a lot of the Hugo functionality, almost everything that he did.

38:58.140 --> 39:01.860
I was like, wow, that's almost exactly how I would have thought to implement it.

39:01.860 --> 39:03.980
That's that's perfect.

39:03.980 --> 39:07.620
So it was really awesome to see that happen.

39:07.620 --> 39:10.540
And he did an amazing job with that.

39:10.540 --> 39:16.900
I think my first comment, even though I did ask for some changes, was like, wow, I was

39:16.900 --> 39:21.060
really excited about this PR whenever I was reviewing it.

39:21.060 --> 39:24.260
So where we were like, that's a great idea, somebody that gets it.

39:24.260 --> 39:26.700
And I think didn't we learn about it, Brent, during the road trip?

39:26.700 --> 39:28.260
We're like, wow, here we are.

39:28.260 --> 39:31.980
You know, we're hustling on the road trip and the improvements keep rolling into the

39:31.980 --> 39:32.980
website.

39:32.980 --> 39:35.220
Yeah, I was bouncing around in the passenger seat and I was like, Chris, you got to see

39:35.220 --> 39:37.220
what they're doing over here.

39:37.220 --> 39:39.900
And I know we did a little bit in the last office hours.

39:39.900 --> 39:45.860
But now it's well, in theory, assuming what we just did is going to production properly,

39:45.860 --> 39:46.860
it's actually live.

39:46.860 --> 39:47.860
And it's not perfect.

39:47.860 --> 39:51.100
There's still things we need to tweak still, but it's like 90% there.

39:51.100 --> 39:52.860
And I think it's a wonderful thing for us.

39:52.860 --> 39:58.580
I was I think the reason this came was I was sitting in the passenger seat of lady jupes

39:58.580 --> 40:06.700
driving down I-5 and like an animal, I was changing the sponsorship page manually.

40:06.700 --> 40:10.780
And in my pull request to do such I was like, can someone please make it so that this is

40:10.780 --> 40:15.940
the last time I need to do this and chance stepped up so thank you chance.

40:15.940 --> 40:16.940
That's great.

40:16.940 --> 40:19.060
Yes, thank you chance very much.

40:19.060 --> 40:24.220
For this specific PR, not necessarily a shout out, but something that I'm very happy.

40:24.220 --> 40:30.180
Initially Kyle Potts had done the initial contribution for our end to end testing.

40:30.180 --> 40:36.460
And I was going to simply kind of refactor a little bit of stuff after he had submitted

40:36.460 --> 40:38.060
the PR.

40:38.060 --> 40:46.500
But then we had the issue of the JB matrix had failed for its actual check.

40:46.500 --> 40:51.980
And so I went and I added a check for that.

40:51.980 --> 40:53.700
And that spurred into a whole spiral.

40:53.700 --> 40:54.700
Yeah, it sure did.

40:54.700 --> 40:55.700
Oh, man.

40:55.700 --> 41:04.940
It spurred into a whole spiral of I created a test that whenever I ran it worked locally.

41:04.940 --> 41:12.380
But whenever I did it through the CI on GitHub, it failed.

41:12.380 --> 41:21.940
And it also failed whenever we were running specifically it against the actual website.

41:21.940 --> 41:27.380
So it failed in the most important use case.

41:27.380 --> 41:33.060
And in a very odd instance, that it works locally, but it didn't work, even though we

41:33.060 --> 41:35.260
were using the same exact things.

41:35.260 --> 41:41.060
So I ended up reworking how we're doing end to end testing completely.

41:41.060 --> 41:45.220
So that way, it's imitating the exact same way that we're deploying a Docker container

41:45.220 --> 41:47.020
using nginx.

41:47.020 --> 41:53.540
I am doing the exact same way that we're doing it for the website locally as well now.

41:53.540 --> 41:56.740
So we are no longer running into that issue.

41:56.740 --> 41:57.900
That's great.

41:57.900 --> 42:02.940
And I think that's just another example of like, I was I was partly worried that when

42:02.940 --> 42:07.000
we released the website, you know, on that live day when we hit go and everything went

42:07.000 --> 42:12.060
live for the very first day, I was worried that all of our energy that we had produced

42:12.060 --> 42:16.740
as a community was going to kind of peter out because it was like, okay, we all got

42:16.740 --> 42:21.460
together and made this really amazing website and had the basic features that we needed.

42:21.460 --> 42:24.980
And, you know, we had a checklist of features, and most of those had been checked off.

42:24.980 --> 42:31.820
And I didn't know if that energy would have continued for a few months past that live

42:31.820 --> 42:32.820
date.

42:32.820 --> 42:35.020
What was that end of August?

42:35.020 --> 42:38.420
And it's actually kind of been the opposite.

42:38.420 --> 42:42.540
You know, some people have gotten busy and have had to step away for a bit.

42:42.540 --> 42:46.840
But really, the community just keeps showing up and keeps throwing features at this website

42:46.840 --> 42:49.540
that we didn't even really know we needed.

42:49.540 --> 42:51.540
And actually, it turns out, they're amazing.

42:51.540 --> 42:56.860
And even like the end to end test, for example, someone, you know, cowpots came in and created

42:56.860 --> 43:00.400
that and was like, Oh, this is an amazing contribution, we definitely need it.

43:00.400 --> 43:05.380
And then Elray, you just like took that concept and shaped it to make it even better.

43:05.380 --> 43:10.320
And it's just like, amazing to watch this website just keep growing and keep getting

43:10.320 --> 43:12.780
better really, in all aspects.

43:12.780 --> 43:17.580
And also, it's great, because the website really is for the audience, it's not really

43:17.580 --> 43:18.740
for us as much.

43:18.740 --> 43:22.980
So we don't always have a great grasp of what people want out of our own website.

43:22.980 --> 43:25.740
As stupid as that sounds, it's actually true.

43:25.740 --> 43:31.100
We don't really, unless we tell ourselves and force ourselves, use the website, go use

43:31.100 --> 43:34.100
the website, like it's just, we don't, we have all this stuff, it's right here on my

43:34.100 --> 43:35.100
file server, right?

43:35.100 --> 43:36.340
It's just not the way we think about it.

43:36.340 --> 43:41.260
So it's really great to have somebody that has the perspective of an audience member,

43:41.260 --> 43:44.660
looking at it, making this better for audience members.

43:44.660 --> 43:48.860
That part of it is really, I think, the secret sauce of this website, because it's just not

43:48.860 --> 43:50.740
something we have eyes on in that way.

43:50.740 --> 43:55.560
As hard as we try, we just, just not where our minds at.

43:55.560 --> 43:56.560
So that's pretty great.

43:56.560 --> 43:57.560
Well, okay.

43:57.560 --> 43:58.560
I think it's deployed.

43:58.560 --> 43:59.560
Is it?

43:59.560 --> 44:00.560
How do we know?

44:00.560 --> 44:02.420
I refreshed and it loaded.

44:02.420 --> 44:03.960
So that seemed like a good sign.

44:03.960 --> 44:09.300
So one of the ways that, or one of the things we actually need to work on improving, the

44:09.300 --> 44:13.700
way that I know that it went live is because underneath Linux Unplugged, it says Linux

44:13.700 --> 44:16.880
or Linode cloud hosting instead of just Linode.

44:16.880 --> 44:18.720
That's something we're going to work on.

44:18.720 --> 44:22.780
It's part of the automated sponsorship.

44:22.780 --> 44:26.340
So some of these things, actually, I think it's a good sign that we're not noticing because

44:26.340 --> 44:27.820
it means nothing broke.

44:27.820 --> 44:28.820
Yeah.

44:28.820 --> 44:29.820
Yeah.

44:29.820 --> 44:30.820
It's up.

44:30.820 --> 44:31.820
It's up.

44:31.820 --> 44:32.820
Well done.

44:32.820 --> 44:33.820
Well, you know what you get?

44:33.820 --> 44:34.820
You get a happy applause.

44:34.820 --> 44:35.820
Yeah.

44:35.820 --> 44:36.820
There they go.

44:36.820 --> 44:37.820
See how happy they are.

44:37.820 --> 44:38.820
Oh, they love it.

44:38.820 --> 44:39.820
Oh man.

44:39.820 --> 44:40.820
They love it so much.

44:40.820 --> 44:41.820
They're happy.

44:41.820 --> 44:43.860
They're very happy about it.

44:43.860 --> 44:44.860
Well done.

44:44.860 --> 44:48.340
One of the other small things that wasn't something I don't think anyone would have

44:48.340 --> 44:54.100
noticed unless actually running into this issue is that specifically for CoderRadio,

44:54.100 --> 44:57.740
they use the tag of C sharp.

44:57.740 --> 45:01.720
And whenever you tried to click on that, since there's a symbol in there and the pound sign

45:01.720 --> 45:08.260
can be interpreted by the actual address bar, it screwed up being able to navigate to it.

45:08.260 --> 45:11.700
And you could only navigate to C whenever you clicked on C sharp.

45:11.700 --> 45:12.700
Frickin CoderRadio.

45:12.700 --> 45:13.700
I know.

45:13.700 --> 45:15.700
They're monsters over there.

45:15.700 --> 45:21.060
But now you can click on whenever you see C sharp as a tag, you can click on it and

45:21.060 --> 45:23.100
it actually goes to C sharp.

45:23.100 --> 45:29.020
What a fascinating way to view Jupyter broadcasting topics is by tag.

45:29.020 --> 45:31.960
I never really do that, but we sure talk about Nextcloud a lot.

45:31.960 --> 45:35.380
Look at all these shows where we talk about Nextcloud.

45:35.380 --> 45:36.940
Linux Action News episode three.

45:36.940 --> 45:38.420
How about that?

45:38.420 --> 45:39.420
Oh my.

45:39.420 --> 45:40.420
Yeah.

45:40.420 --> 45:45.580
The whole reason why I ended up finding that was because I was trying to deploy on Netlify

45:45.580 --> 45:52.740
and they said you couldn't have pound signs in file names and I was like, what?

45:52.740 --> 45:53.740
What do you mean?

45:53.740 --> 45:55.340
There are no pound signs.

45:55.340 --> 46:00.140
And then it was because they were taking the generated content and using that instead and

46:00.140 --> 46:01.940
they had that restriction.

46:01.940 --> 46:04.860
So that was the only reason why that was found.

46:04.860 --> 46:10.020
It was because it was preventing me from trying to implement the deploy preview months earlier.

46:10.020 --> 46:17.340
Back in my day, you only had eight characters in a file name and it was all lowercase.

46:17.340 --> 46:18.340
Actually weren't they all uppercase?

46:18.340 --> 46:19.340
Sure.

46:19.340 --> 46:20.340
Either way.

46:20.340 --> 46:21.340
Go for it.

46:21.340 --> 46:23.180
Elray, I have some questions for you.

46:23.180 --> 46:28.140
Give me a sense from your perspective of what the community around this website project

46:28.140 --> 46:29.140
has been like.

46:29.140 --> 46:32.500
Cause I know we have a perspective, which is that you guys are awesome, but I'm curious.

46:32.500 --> 46:37.580
It seems like you've worked on some other projects, both professionally and maybe some

46:37.580 --> 46:38.820
open source stuff as well.

46:38.820 --> 46:42.980
So can you give us a sense from, you know, you on the other side over there, what it's

46:42.980 --> 46:43.980
been like?

46:43.980 --> 46:46.820
Well, first off, I think everyone else in the audience is really awesome.

46:46.820 --> 46:51.300
So I will definitely say that I don't know if I am, but they are for sure.

46:51.300 --> 46:52.300
Humble.

46:52.300 --> 46:57.340
So it's been really interesting to kind of see the passing of the torch.

46:57.340 --> 47:03.180
So I know that initially Stefan and Cairo were the main people that were kind of driving

47:03.180 --> 47:04.980
this initiative.

47:04.980 --> 47:09.740
And as I started to kind of contribute more and try to be more of a serious contributor,

47:09.740 --> 47:12.620
I was able to help them out.

47:12.620 --> 47:18.540
And now people are mentioning helping me out by reviewing things and it feels weird, but

47:18.540 --> 47:24.180
it's been really awesome is that as I've become more of a serious contributor and trying to

47:24.180 --> 47:31.740
contribute in other ways, like creating issues or commenting on different people's PRs that

47:31.740 --> 47:35.220
I've slowly been given more privileges as well.

47:35.220 --> 47:41.660
And that's helped open how I can continue to give more value for the value you guys

47:41.660 --> 47:43.100
give me already.

47:43.100 --> 47:51.360
So I've become more of a initial drive by contributor to being I would consider myself

47:51.360 --> 47:53.500
probably maintain a maintainer.

47:53.500 --> 47:59.940
And so initially, I actually had been messaging Stefan about, hey, I wanted to do this thing

47:59.940 --> 48:04.260
that I noticed because of something that you had done for your initial MVP.

48:04.260 --> 48:08.960
And that was before it was actually changed to the official MVP.

48:08.960 --> 48:16.020
And so I had tried to start working on it, and then I got super loaded with work.

48:16.020 --> 48:19.020
And so I wasn't able to actually work on it at all.

48:19.020 --> 48:21.380
And it continued to progress forward.

48:21.380 --> 48:29.300
And so I was able to months later, come back and then started being more of a serious contributor.

48:29.300 --> 48:33.000
And as I had my workload lighten up.

48:33.000 --> 48:40.180
So it went from me really wanting to help out and not being able to and then eventually

48:40.180 --> 48:44.420
finding the time to actually be more of a serious contributor.

48:44.420 --> 48:49.260
It's been really awesome to kind of see, as I've made this journey, other people are certain

48:49.260 --> 48:52.300
to make their journeys at different points as well.

48:52.300 --> 48:58.020
The community has continued to just be amazing.

48:58.020 --> 49:05.060
So I remember I was going back to, I think it was Chance's, Chance M's first PR, whenever

49:05.060 --> 49:08.740
he was telling me something about white space, and it was going to reference that for another

49:08.740 --> 49:11.100
PR that someone had done.

49:11.100 --> 49:18.680
And whenever I had, and I often feel this way, I'm more of a vocal critic, because there's

49:18.680 --> 49:22.820
some of the technical things that people are new to.

49:22.820 --> 49:28.620
And so just trying to kind of help guide them, I end up pointing out a lot of things whenever

49:28.620 --> 49:32.860
other people just kind of tend to approve it because it aesthetically looks good, which

49:32.860 --> 49:34.780
is the part that I actually struggle with.

49:34.780 --> 49:37.420
So it's good that there are people that do that.

49:37.420 --> 49:42.060
See, but you say critic there, but I've watched your contributions.

49:42.060 --> 49:47.260
And I would say they're more, I would call it more mentorship, because you tend to be

49:47.260 --> 49:49.660
like, hey, this is great, and it works.

49:49.660 --> 49:54.820
But this might be a more Hugo way of doing it, or this may be a more, you have this special

49:54.820 --> 49:59.980
term that I love that I can't remember that is about only having things in one place,

49:59.980 --> 50:01.980
but get used a bunch of times and

50:01.980 --> 50:04.740
idempotent or reusable or dry.

50:04.740 --> 50:05.740
Dry, that's the one.

50:05.740 --> 50:06.740
There you go.

50:06.740 --> 50:07.740
You hit it.

50:07.740 --> 50:08.740
Yeah.

50:08.740 --> 50:12.300
So I would call you, you know, you've been an amazing mentor in this project as well

50:12.300 --> 50:13.980
that I've really appreciated.

50:13.980 --> 50:15.740
So don't be too hard on yourself.

50:15.740 --> 50:18.220
I definitely try to.

50:18.220 --> 50:22.060
But I remember reviewing his first PR and there were quite a few comments.

50:22.060 --> 50:26.960
And then like I had made the comment earlier of, I saw his latest PR and I was astounded

50:26.960 --> 50:28.580
with how amazing it was.

50:28.580 --> 50:33.780
So it was, it's been awesome to kind of see people contribute and continue to grow in

50:33.780 --> 50:39.060
their technical knowledge and acumen about the project and becoming more serious contributors

50:39.060 --> 50:40.280
as well.

50:40.280 --> 50:45.040
So it's been really awesome to kind of see that progression from the outside, the maturity

50:45.040 --> 50:50.700
of JB's repository specifically, it's been an ever growing thing.

50:50.700 --> 50:58.860
I've contributed a little bit to one contribution to the Ansible communities repository for

50:58.860 --> 51:02.580
a specific small change that was failing over there.

51:02.580 --> 51:06.180
And they have like an entire automated CI system and other things.

51:06.180 --> 51:08.200
So like they're really mature.

51:08.200 --> 51:13.220
And I'd say we're definitely at least in the middle because we do have automated things

51:13.220 --> 51:18.540
where we're doing checks and other things to make sure that we're continuing to improve

51:18.540 --> 51:21.740
and giving fast feedback to users.

51:21.740 --> 51:27.020
So we've definitely got, we're growing and we're not there to the finish line yet, but

51:27.020 --> 51:31.580
we're definitely at least probably, I'd say 50% for the maturity of what I would consider

51:31.580 --> 51:33.220
a mature open source project.

51:33.220 --> 51:35.180
Oh, we're all grown up.

51:35.180 --> 51:36.180
Look at that.

51:36.180 --> 51:37.180
At least halfway there.

51:37.180 --> 51:42.180
Well, it's better than where we were before.

51:42.180 --> 51:43.180
Okay.

51:43.180 --> 51:50.020
Well, that brings me to, I think maybe one last question, which is what can we do better?

51:50.020 --> 51:53.700
Because I feel like, you know, okay, we're 50% there, but there's a lot of room to grow.

51:53.700 --> 52:00.680
So from a, less from a features in the website perspective, but more from a, you know, how

52:00.680 --> 52:06.780
we're helping people contribute and how we're managing contributions perspective, what do

52:06.780 --> 52:09.060
you think is the next step for us?

52:09.060 --> 52:11.620
There's definitely a few different ways to proceed.

52:11.620 --> 52:15.840
One of them that I think I've attempted to do it in the past, but just haven't really

52:15.840 --> 52:22.420
had any time to do it currently is figuring out a way to make the issues be in a more

52:22.420 --> 52:25.220
interpretable layout.

52:25.220 --> 52:30.220
So currently everyone kind of just has to peruse issues directly inside of GitHub, which

52:30.220 --> 52:34.740
can be difficult for people if they're just trying to do a quick contribution here or

52:34.740 --> 52:40.780
there, figuring out a way to either use the projects tab inside of GitHub or something

52:40.780 --> 52:41.780
like that.

52:41.780 --> 52:45.540
So where we can point people towards, Hey, if you want to do something, this is where

52:45.540 --> 52:46.540
you go.

52:46.540 --> 52:49.500
And it's easy to see, these are the things that need to be worked on.

52:49.500 --> 52:53.780
These are the things that currently being worked on and the labels that Brent has made

52:53.780 --> 52:57.580
has definitely helped and it helps kind of give a fast feedback.

52:57.580 --> 53:03.660
It's just being able to kind of give like a higher overview of like what is available.

53:03.660 --> 53:04.660
That's a really good point.

53:04.660 --> 53:06.820
And that's been suggested to me previously.

53:06.820 --> 53:11.500
I've spent some time in that project's view and it's been mentioned that that would be

53:11.500 --> 53:13.220
a really great thing to have.

53:13.220 --> 53:17.060
I just haven't quite wrapped my head around it yet, so I think I got some homework there.

53:17.060 --> 53:18.060
Definitely.

53:18.060 --> 53:19.620
It's a good suggestion.

53:19.620 --> 53:21.340
It's a good suggestion.

53:21.340 --> 53:24.340
I could definitely see that being a way to like, okay, I want to get started.

53:24.340 --> 53:25.380
Where do I start?

53:25.380 --> 53:28.580
And I can see that being a way to help people figure that out.

53:28.580 --> 53:35.580
I think another thing that as we continue to mature how people contribute to us, integrating

53:35.580 --> 53:41.660
tests as people integrate contributions is going to be important.

53:41.660 --> 53:49.500
So for example, CGBasePlayer, he did a contribution recently and he actually submitted a test

53:49.500 --> 53:50.500
for it as well.

53:50.500 --> 53:53.140
And I was like, oh, I wasn't expecting that.

53:53.140 --> 53:57.620
It was really awesome to actually see his contribution and see that the accompanying

53:57.620 --> 53:58.620
test was there.

53:58.620 --> 54:01.900
I had mentioned it on the issue saying, hey, it'd be a good idea to have a test there as

54:01.900 --> 54:02.900
well.

54:02.900 --> 54:06.500
And that was for the form submission issue, I just remembered, where if you hit submit

54:06.500 --> 54:10.980
and it failed, the actual submit button would disappear past the iframe.

54:10.980 --> 54:11.980
In the contact form.

54:11.980 --> 54:13.940
Yeah, in the contact form.

54:13.940 --> 54:17.540
So he actually made a test for it as well, which was really awesome.

54:17.540 --> 54:19.780
Somebody's got to write that test.

54:19.780 --> 54:22.180
So yeah, that's great.

54:22.180 --> 54:23.180
All right.

54:23.180 --> 54:24.980
Well, let's get to some boosts.

54:24.980 --> 54:26.420
True Grits boosted in.

54:26.420 --> 54:29.100
Four score and seven boosts ago.

54:29.100 --> 54:31.220
With an enterprise boost.

54:31.220 --> 54:38.700
Yeah, 1701 sat something I've noticed as a listener is that on your road trips, you try

54:38.700 --> 54:42.340
and cram a bunch of traveling into a short period of time.

54:42.340 --> 54:48.640
What if you tried to space out the trips and stay in places for just a bit longer or maybe

54:48.640 --> 54:51.980
drive shorter distances at a time?

54:51.980 --> 54:55.560
Also how large of a project would it be to just lose the remote connection to the studio

54:55.560 --> 54:57.380
and just record everything at the RV?

54:57.380 --> 55:00.660
To me, sounds like that would solve a lot of issues.

55:00.660 --> 55:02.400
Why didn't you think any of that, Brent?

55:02.400 --> 55:07.020
This is actually a multi-year conversation we've been having.

55:07.020 --> 55:11.220
And these seem like obvious solutions.

55:11.220 --> 55:16.460
However, it turns out that there is a lot more complexity in the background than we

55:16.460 --> 55:19.380
tend to lead on all the time.

55:19.380 --> 55:24.220
Some of that complexity is just like other outside factors that we can't even control.

55:24.220 --> 55:29.240
Yeah, you know, family, kids, jobs, show production schedules.

55:29.240 --> 55:31.640
That's truly what sets the pace of a road trip.

55:31.640 --> 55:38.500
We start with a road trip plan that's like a month plus long and then we figure out how

55:38.500 --> 55:43.940
to whittle it down to just as quick as possible because we just feel, I feel like there's

55:43.940 --> 55:48.180
no better way to age me than just to constantly put me into a pressure cooker.

55:48.180 --> 55:51.080
And so why not just get right to it?

55:51.080 --> 55:54.220
It's just that, you know, I got three young kids, so there's that element of it and it's

55:54.220 --> 55:55.500
just the way it is.

55:55.500 --> 55:58.900
But we will always be experimenting with ways to make it more sustainable.

55:58.900 --> 56:02.860
I think we're working on a path to sustainability.

56:02.860 --> 56:07.860
And as far as doing the shows in the RV, if we have really solid connectivity, like Starlink's

56:07.860 --> 56:11.300
really rocking or something like that, we have and can do.

56:11.300 --> 56:15.340
But if we have limited connectivity, like say maybe we only have a singular LTE connection,

56:15.340 --> 56:19.300
maybe it's only like at half strength, then it's actually a little bit better to offload

56:19.300 --> 56:22.540
a lot of like the streaming and the remote connectivity to the studio.

56:22.540 --> 56:28.360
And then we just have to establish one decent quality Opus audio stream to the studio.

56:28.360 --> 56:32.780
And as long as the Internet connection is powerful enough to just get that Opus audio

56:32.780 --> 56:36.340
back and forth, we can do a show and then we can mix in the studio and whatnot.

56:36.340 --> 56:40.420
Of course, it requires a whole bunch of remote tools and whatnot.

56:40.420 --> 56:47.260
But when I am an older man, probably, you know, 10 years from now and maybe less, who

56:47.260 --> 56:49.660
knows, times seem to be flying with the kids.

56:49.660 --> 56:55.620
But when the kids are older and dad isn't, you know, awesome and great to hang out with

56:55.620 --> 56:58.660
and they've got their own friends and their own things and their own cars, maybe I will

56:58.660 --> 57:00.540
go for longer road trips.

57:00.540 --> 57:01.540
You never know.

57:01.540 --> 57:03.940
That's that'll be my might be a little podcasting nomad.

57:03.940 --> 57:04.940
Yeah.

57:04.940 --> 57:08.060
And that'll be my reconciliation for the fact that my kids don't have anything to do with

57:08.060 --> 57:09.060
me.

57:09.060 --> 57:12.240
Rustic Castaversa comes in with a thousand sats.

57:12.240 --> 57:17.260
So I know this whole episode has been about tough travel, of course, last week's episode.

57:17.260 --> 57:22.300
But if you ever thought about doing a ham show with Noah, there is a museum in Minnesota

57:22.300 --> 57:25.580
that works and would be really a cool place to do the show.

57:25.580 --> 57:28.420
It's called the Pavek, P-A-V-E-K Museum.

57:28.420 --> 57:33.700
I'll have a link in the show notes, Minnesota's source for the history of electronic communication.

57:33.700 --> 57:36.780
That actually looks like a really cool place to do a show from.

57:36.780 --> 57:37.780
Wow.

57:37.780 --> 57:39.860
Chris, I had never considered doing the show in a museum.

57:39.860 --> 57:45.140
We always pictured like a theater or I love this all of a sudden.

57:45.140 --> 57:46.980
It's way cool.

57:46.980 --> 57:52.220
You know, we have a really cool museum of electricity about 30, 40 minutes north of

57:52.220 --> 57:53.220
the studio.

57:53.220 --> 57:54.220
Really?

57:54.220 --> 57:55.220
You've never mentioned this to me before.

57:55.220 --> 57:59.220
It used to be the after party for Linux Fest Northwest when it was a smaller event.

57:59.220 --> 58:02.180
And they've got they've got a Tesla cage in there where they'll you know, you can stand

58:02.180 --> 58:05.460
in there and they'll zap you with lightning and it goes all over the cage.

58:05.460 --> 58:08.340
And they've got tons of old radio stuff in there.

58:08.340 --> 58:10.260
So every time someone does a boost, it'll zap us.

58:10.260 --> 58:11.260
Oh, that'd be cool.

58:11.260 --> 58:15.180
As long as you got the Tesla coil charged up, as long as you got lightning network,

58:15.180 --> 58:16.180
it's pretty awesome.

58:16.180 --> 58:17.660
Yeah, it is.

58:17.660 --> 58:19.340
Wise Papa John used it.

58:19.340 --> 58:20.560
Two thousand sats.

58:20.560 --> 58:21.560
Love the show, guys.

58:21.560 --> 58:26.340
It started on self hosted over a year ago and I still haven't found a Raspberry Pi

58:26.340 --> 58:27.340
for sale.

58:27.340 --> 58:29.380
But thanks for everything else, fellas.

58:29.380 --> 58:34.660
And by the way, if anyone is in the Memphis area, he also sent another 222 sats and has

58:34.660 --> 58:36.020
a Pi for sale.

58:36.020 --> 58:37.020
Let's talk.

58:37.020 --> 58:40.900
Well, Chris, you mentioned a new little computer that you got in Linux Unplugged.

58:40.900 --> 58:42.260
What was the name of it?

58:42.260 --> 58:43.260
Right.

58:43.260 --> 58:44.260
The old Droid H3.

58:44.260 --> 58:45.260
Brantley.

58:45.260 --> 58:46.260
What do they say?

58:46.260 --> 58:47.260
The Raspberry Pi color.

58:47.260 --> 58:48.260
Yeah, we'll see.

58:48.260 --> 58:49.660
I have it in for testing.

58:49.660 --> 58:56.740
My RAM and MVME drive are supposed to arrive today, maybe while we're doing the show.

58:56.740 --> 59:00.980
So I'm going to hustle up on getting that going and I'll report back because I'm pretty

59:00.980 --> 59:01.980
excited about it.

59:01.980 --> 59:03.140
I'm done with the Pi, I think.

59:03.140 --> 59:08.520
I think I'm I mean, I have I have no ill will towards the Pi, but I just think I'm moving

59:08.520 --> 59:12.340
on from the Pi with this with that old Droid H3.

59:12.340 --> 59:15.980
Two SATA ports plus MVME.

59:15.980 --> 59:16.980
That's pretty good.

59:16.980 --> 59:18.780
The only thing that would make it better is if it had built in Wi-Fi.

59:18.780 --> 59:22.120
It does not, but it does have four USB ports.

59:22.120 --> 59:25.220
And if it had Intel NICs instead of Realtek NICs.

59:25.220 --> 59:29.100
But I'm just happy they're not on the USB bus.

59:29.100 --> 59:31.980
Austin Matt boots in with 69, 69 SATs.

59:31.980 --> 59:33.980
Coming in hot with the boost.

59:33.980 --> 59:35.900
Here's a show name idea.

59:35.900 --> 59:36.900
Captain's Quarters.

59:36.900 --> 59:40.620
Kind of keeps the same vibes as Office Hours, spatially at least.

59:40.620 --> 59:42.540
Everyone's coming in to hang out in your quarters.

59:42.540 --> 59:46.540
And it also kind of keeps it up with a potential space theme with a little Star Trek vibe.

59:46.540 --> 59:47.540
I like it.

59:47.540 --> 59:52.500
I think Captain's Quarters would suffer from the same issue that Office Hours suffers from.

59:52.500 --> 59:53.500
Right.

59:53.500 --> 59:54.500
But at least we're with our crew.

59:54.500 --> 59:55.500
Yeah, I like that.

59:55.500 --> 59:58.900
I do like the idea that the J.B. audience we call our crew.

59:58.900 --> 01:00:02.020
But everybody's going to expect us to talk about Star Trek constantly.

01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.020
Don't we?

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:06.660
You know, it's like it'd be a Captain Pike hair review podcast where we only talk about

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:10.700
Captain Pike's great hair and how to get my hair to the level of Captain Pike's great

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:11.700
hair.

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:12.700
Yeah, I like the idea, though.

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:16.820
I like I get where you're going, Austin Matt, with like the vibe and this and the space

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.060
connection.

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.220
I think I think the new name should keep that up.

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:22.660
So do keep the suggestions coming in.

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:23.660
If you would.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:24.660
J.L.T.

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:27.220
Gordon boost in twenty five hundred sats boost.

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:32.100
How about TNG, the next generation as a show name?

01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:36.400
And you could do TNG dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com space related.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:40.000
And it's clear it's about Jupiter broadcasting.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.140
So J.B. the next generation.

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:43.140
You know what?

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.340
It worked for one show that seemed to be pretty popular.

01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:48.140
So maybe maybe.

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:52.060
And it looks like Gene Bean is our baller booster this episode with thirteen thousand

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:54.740
three hundred and seventy sats.

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:56.260
Hot take while you're still talking.

01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:01.340
The consumable website is something I really like the idea of, but I want it to still work

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:03.540
if I'm using a hosting company like Buzzsprout.

01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:09.100
I love the idea of using it as the feed, as a source of truth for large portions of it,

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.100
though.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:14.020
I just want to be able to offload things like download infrastructure and host to a hosting

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.020
provider.

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:17.180
Yeah, you get a you get a half ding on that one.

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.180
I agree, Gene Bean.

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:21.660
When we're looking at this, that seems to be the tricky bit.

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:27.820
These MP3 files are big in relative terms to HTTP, general types of traffic, and you

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:31.140
want them to be very fast and you want them to be fast.

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:33.380
If you're in New Zealand, you want them to be fast.

01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:35.040
If you're in Australia, you want them to be fast.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:41.640
If you're in Austin, right, it's it's a tricky problem to solve when you consider that the

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:47.200
nature of a podcast is that when it gets released, it's potential that tens of thousands of people

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.860
go hit that file.

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:51.660
It's usually spread out over a 24 hour period, so it's not quite that bad.

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:57.900
But you don't you don't want the downloads to be slow because I've been that guy who's

01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:03.260
out in the car just like waiting for that that MP3 to finish downloading so I can start

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:06.500
my drive and just thinking, why don't they have a better CDN?

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.960
I don't want you to ever worry about that with JB stuff.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.060
So I agree, Gene Bean, that is the tricky part.

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:16.700
I am considering Cloudflare R2 on top of maybe like Linode object storage or something like

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.700
that.

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:18.700
Going to experiment with office hours.

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:25.060
I basically I've come to the conclusion that we got to eff around to find out.

01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:28.380
And depending on how much we eff around, that's how much we'll find out.

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:32.220
And so I'm going to eff around with office hours and find out is the conclusion I've

01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.220
come to.

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.220
This is where we break things.

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:35.220
Yeah.

01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.220
Yeah.

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.980
So I am boosting with a thousand sats.

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.980
Just testing boost CLI.

01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:40.980
Actual boost coming soon.

01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:41.980
You know what?

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:42.980
Wow.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.340
Any boost with boost CLI is an actual boost.

01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:46.540
That is a baller boost in a totally different way.

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:49.540
I hoard that which your kind covet.

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.020
Yeah, that's it.

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:52.020
That's it.

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:55.740
Boost CLI is a whole suite of competence.

01:02:55.740 --> 01:03:01.060
You get boost CLI working and you've got, you basically should get hired.

01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.420
In my opinion, if somebody came in and said, yeah, I got boost CLI, you're hired, you got

01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.420
a job.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:08.720
Yeah, you should, you should easily get a job.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:12.340
If you're having troubles getting a job, have them call me, I'll explain it to them.

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.340
All right.

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:17.220
So a pag dot boosted in with 3,333 sats.

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.220
Boost!

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:19.220
Hi you all.

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:22.540
Chris likes to recommend breeze for those who don't want to switch to a new podcast

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:23.540
app.

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:27.340
Well, I am a happy user of antenna pod and I don't want to switch.

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:31.540
My issue with breeze is that I really haven't found an easy way just to use it for plain

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:32.540
old boosting.

01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:38.260
To actually send the boost, I got to go find your episode, press play, then send the boost

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:39.260
in.

01:03:39.260 --> 01:03:42.260
Not to mention, he's probably already listening to the podcast and antenna pod while he's

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:43.260
doing it.

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:44.800
So there's like that whole issue.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:51.940
Here's the trick that works for pag dot or page dot or pag, pag day pod verse allows

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:56.500
me not only to boost without playing the podcast, but I can actually do it from my PC and don't

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.980
have to bother with my dang phone.

01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:00.380
I added the dang part.

01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:01.380
That's a great tip.

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:04.320
And I've been noticing more and more folks out there are using pod verse.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.980
And actually you can go to the episode webpage on our new site and just click the lightning

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:10.460
bolt on the player and it'll take you right to there.

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.700
So new features for the website.

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:16.720
We haven't I don't think I've covered that yet part, but that's one of the things it's

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.860
been in draft PR for I don't know how long and I've wanted to go tackle it.

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:26.900
I just haven't had a chance to go do it to integrate value for value on the actual website.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.540
Yeah, it's really awesome.

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:31.700
We should we should talk new features here in a sec.

01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:34.180
That's a that's a that's probably top on my list.

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:40.380
And then peg dot page dot I think you're about to get corrected here, Chris.

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.700
Just a short boost.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:43.220
They sent three hundred and thirty three stats.

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:47.460
Just a short boost on the pronunciation of my name.

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:51.380
You're mispronouncing the G. It's pronounced like the G in dig.

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:53.580
So it's peg doc.

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.500
Peg dot.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.500
Because dig.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:57.500
Peg.

01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:58.500
I don't know.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:04:59.500
I think you got it.

01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.500
I don't know.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.500
I think you got it.

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:02.500
You think?

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:03.500
I need to know.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:04.500
I need to know.

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.820
Thank you to everybody who sent a boost in or sent some stream streaming some stats.

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:09.900
We appreciate all of you.

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:10.900
Thank you very much.

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:14.700
You can grab a new podcast app at new podcast apps dot com and send a boost in or just go

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:15.820
to Podverse.

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:21.020
That's a GPL open source podcast player that's got a Web version and you can boost from there.

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.020
I love Albi.

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:24.060
The Albi extension makes it all possible.

01:05:24.060 --> 01:05:25.060
Albi.

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:26.060
You'll learn all about it.

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.380
It's it's a whole new world of technology.

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:29.500
It's all decentralized.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.080
It's all self-hosted.

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:33.000
No company can cut you off.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.380
It's a beautiful thing.

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:38.180
And it incentivizes creators to respond directly to their audience.

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:43.100
And on our side, when those boosts come in, it's a smile on our face every single time.

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:46.380
So thank you everybody who goes to new podcast apps, grabs one and sends a boost into the

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.380
show.

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:54.520
We got 250 stats too from Tepalus who enjoyed the behind the scenes troubleshooting information

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.600
we talked about last week.

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.780
That's kind of our idea here.

01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:00.980
Office Hours is really a podcast for J.B. community members.

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.860
We're not really trying to reach anybody else.

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:05.980
It's great if they want to listen, probably half the stuff probably doesn't make sense

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:06.980
if they do.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:07.980
Yeah.

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:11.540
So before we get out of here, let's talk about like, you know, some new stuff that you'd

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:12.540
like to see.

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:13.540
Alex and Brent.

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:16.440
I mean, we talked about value for value in the browser.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:21.140
That sounds tricky just because, like, how do you I guess you need a way to select which

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:22.140
show you're boosting.

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:27.340
Like, I'm picturing the UI on that because booster based are tied to a particular episode.

01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:33.060
So you need like a message box, an episode selector, something like that.

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:36.780
And maybe then it would read the value tag from the feed for that episode.

01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:40.940
So I haven't looked into all the specifics yet, but I figured we would try and take kind

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:45.480
of a similar approach to how Podverse actually implements it in their website.

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:48.240
So just kind of have a form on the side.

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.140
And again, I mentioned I'm not the aesthetic one.

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.040
So I'm only thinking of functionality.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.040
Team effort.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:55.040
Exactly.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:59.940
So if you had like a form on the side that would just automatically for that episode

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:05.060
that you're on, choose all the necessary information and submit it the exact same way.

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:07.460
So that was what I was mentally thinking.

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:10.820
But again, I haven't super dug into a lot of this stuff.

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:13.020
So I suppose, yeah, that makes sense.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:15.740
And you could even just infer it based on the episode you're watching.

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:20.700
I picture something like Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash boost.

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.140
And so it's just one spot you go to.

01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:25.020
So you don't have to, like, go to the individual episode page if you don't want you could just

01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:26.020
go to the boost page.

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:29.460
OK, well, how about keep that idea?

01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:34.700
And on every episode page and also show page, you just have a giant boost button.

01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:38.840
And when you click it, it pre fills out the form, you know, takes you there and pre fills

01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:39.840
out the form.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:40.840
I don't know how to do that.

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:41.840
That's someone else's job.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:45.060
But the button should probably be like twelve eighty by seven twenty inside.

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:46.700
I mean, just and it flashes red.

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:47.700
Right.

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:48.700
Yeah.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:49.700
Real big button.

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:50.700
Yeah.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.660
Maybe like just have the button marquee or you've probably seen that website where you

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:56.620
go to click the button and it moves.

01:07:56.620 --> 01:08:00.580
We could do that just like a couple of times to really make them want it, you know, make

01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:08.100
sure I recently saw a movie that the A.I. from the phone.

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:11.800
I can't remember what it's called, but the A.I. from the phone.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:15.920
He was trying to power off the phone and the button moved every time he went to go touch

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.060
the actual power off button.

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.060
It was hilarious.

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:20.060
There you go.

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:21.060
It's the way the future.

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:23.340
Basically, that's what we have now is slow phones.

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.860
You know, when the U.I. changes, Chris, I know that's one of your pet peeves.

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:26.860
I hate that.

01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:28.060
I hate that.

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:31.260
Or websites where the JavaScript finished on the button, it moves right as you're going

01:08:31.260 --> 01:08:34.300
to click and you click on something else and you got to go back and it does it again.

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:37.540
And oh, next has been doing that to me recently.

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:38.540
Now they think about it.

01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:40.660
I hate that so freaking much.

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:41.660
All right.

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:44.340
Alex and Brett, is there anything else we want to talk about while we are gathered together

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:45.340
in the office?

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.220
Well, I wanted to ask you what feature you're looking forward to the most, but I think I

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:49.220
know the answer.

01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:50.220
Yeah.

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:51.220
The value stuff.

01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:52.860
I think one day definitely the boost stuff.

01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:53.980
That would be great.

01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:58.680
I think it would also be really cool to just revisit the idea of a live tracker on our

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.420
website for like a future trip.

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:06.540
Like if we go to do a venue and we drive there, why not have the live tracker going?

01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:08.140
You know, so that kind of stuff.

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:10.740
I could see a live tracker page and we would just have to.

01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:15.080
I think we have a lot of the plumbing on the back end for own tracks and everything still

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.080
in place.

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.300
We just don't have it publishing anywhere.

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:19.300
I'm not positive.

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:20.300
Nothing's precious.

01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.300
We could always redo it, too.

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:26.580
But that could be fun for something that maybe for when we're doing events like a meetup

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:31.340
or a road trip, like an event page that people could go to to get information about the meetups

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:34.420
or get information about the road trip that we're on and see the route.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.660
Something like that could be.

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:38.780
So it's not just whatever gets mentioned in the show.

01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:40.940
There's actually something physical to go look at.

01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:43.740
But there's nothing like I have firm around that and there's no timelines.

01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:46.860
But OK, another example could be Linux Fest Northwest.

01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:51.220
If that comes back and we go, it'd be cool to have a dedicated Linux Fest Northwest page

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:55.540
to find out information where we're going to be at, maybe have the live stream embedded

01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:56.540
there.

01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.540
Something.

01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:00.580
Well, that would kind of integrate into what you were talking about for having the community

01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:05.380
build kind of like a system to help organize those things.

01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:06.380
Right.

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.340
Well, like a meetup dot com alternative.

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:09.340
Yeah.

01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:10.340
Yeah.

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.340
Yeah.

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.340
Oh, yeah.

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:13.340
Yeah.

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:14.340
That's a big one.

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:15.340
Letting the community self organize their own meetups.

01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:18.100
Every single meetup we go to.

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:19.100
It's true.

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:22.020
People always say we should keep doing this, even if the JB guys can't make it.

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:23.020
We should keep doing this.

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:24.020
You guys want to keep doing this?

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:25.020
Oh, yeah.

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.020
I want to keep doing this.

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:27.020
I want to keep doing this.

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:29.780
But the issue is, is they all go their separate ways and it just doesn't really happen.

01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:32.740
But if we had something there and every time we heard them, we could say, all right, go

01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:33.740
here, organize it.

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.180
We'll help you get it set up.

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:39.020
I think people would keep going that they when they go to the meetups are like, shit,

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.020
this is so great.

01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:41.380
I want to do this all the time.

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:43.120
Let's do this every week, guys.

01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:46.460
But then you get back to your life, you get busy, you don't have that connection.

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:49.780
You go back to the two dimensional Internet stuff and you forget about it.

01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:53.100
And if we could just jump on it and if we could if we could tell people, go here, get

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:54.100
it organized.

01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:57.300
And then for our own stuff, we had a tool to use as well, because like Alex is going

01:10:57.300 --> 01:11:00.520
to be at all things open.

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:03.140
We kind of debate, like, is that worth using the meetup page?

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.140
Is it not?

01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:06.940
But if we just had a spot that was ours for this stuff, it seems it feels like it'd be

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:07.940
a no brainer.

01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:09.180
We would just put everything on there.

01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:10.660
Yeah, I agree completely.

01:11:10.660 --> 01:11:11.820
So yeah, that's high on my list, too.

01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:14.820
I have a feature that I'd like to see.

01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:20.380
And it was one we meant to do and just kind of couldn't, and that is to integrate the

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:23.420
archive back into the website.

01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:28.940
That stuff's been missing because we made some hard decisions to say, well, let's put

01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:35.900
the site live with the current shows, because the archive, it turned out, was a bigger project

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:38.900
than we had anticipated.

01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:39.900
And sounds about right.

01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:46.580
You know, Stefan did a lot of work, mostly, I think, in archiving some of that stuff,

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:51.260
but also in just thinking about how to integrate it, because it actually turns out not that

01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:52.940
straightforward.

01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:56.580
And then got busy, which is completely okay, Stefan, we still love you.

01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:00.060
But I think now's the time to do a little bit of work there.

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:05.020
It would be great to have some of those archive shows be available for audience members to

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:06.020
rediscover.

01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:10.020
I know for us, sometimes it's fun to dig back into some of those really old Linux action

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:15.460
show episodes, or even the Linux Unplugged episodes, just to see how silly we sounded.

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:16.460
Me, me.

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:17.460
How silly I sounded.

01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:21.340
Yeah, you sound like a young little kid with his voice turned up high.

01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:22.340
That's true.

01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:24.660
Who wouldn't want to download that?

01:12:24.660 --> 01:12:27.620
Yeah, we better get that posted super fast.

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:28.620
No, I agree.

01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:29.980
It would be good to have.

01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:34.060
I've thought, too, it would be nice to have a way to expose chapter title information,

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:35.060
too, potentially.

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.060
I don't know.

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.060
I'm still on the fence on that.

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:39.620
Because it isn't the Podverse player, you know, you have you have the chapters.

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:41.700
Drew works super hard on those amazing titles.

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:42.700
So I know.

01:12:42.700 --> 01:12:43.700
Yeah.

01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:45.580
But we're really in a good spot with it.

01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:46.840
I think we're in a really good space.

01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.020
So super grateful.

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:52.220
This is one of my, you know, absolute favorite experiences with an open source project for

01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:53.220
obvious reasons.

01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:55.020
But it really just has been.

01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:56.380
The community has been great.

01:12:56.380 --> 01:13:00.180
I think I'm wondering if if there isn't something Alex, maybe this is a good way to wrap up

01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:03.900
maybe a final question to you is do you feel like building an open source project around

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.940
something it has sort of been the key to making this work?

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:09.980
I'm curious to know your thoughts there, because some open source projects start and they kind

01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:15.460
of go nowhere and other ones, they they kind of get momentum and steam and life to them.

01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:18.900
And I'm I'm wondering what you think the differentiator is there.

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:25.820
Yeah, I definitely think, one, it's people dedicated to actually wanting to do some type

01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:27.480
of value for value exchange.

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:33.820
So having not necessarily even the direction of, oh, hey, we need a new website, but just

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:39.500
helping out JB in general is something that I think has continued to give people more

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:45.460
incentive to come back and contribute and to actually see their changes get deployed

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:49.260
and seeing fast responses from the website and stuff.

01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:55.020
It's it gives them a kind of a sense of accomplishment as they're continuing to contribute as well,

01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:58.140
which also then makes them want to contribute again.

01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:05.260
So I think specifically, whenever this whole journey started, saying that it was dedicated

01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:10.700
for the website specifically, allowed people to have something to centralize.

01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:16.560
So I do think having that kind of driving factor, not only, hey, it's a JB project,

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:21.940
but it's also, hey, we need a new website, and we kind of need it urgently because we're

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:25.240
going to be losing our hosting provider.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:30.860
So calling out to the community and being like, hey, we need help and allowing people

01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:37.700
to actually help has really allowed people to feel involved in being a part of the actual

01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:38.700
team.

01:14:38.700 --> 01:14:39.700
Yeah.

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:43.180
And I can also see there's something nice about you contribute something, you actually

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:44.320
get to see the difference.

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:48.380
You know, a lot of a lot of things all of us probably experience and work on is there's

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:51.500
a lot of things we'll tool away at in our day job or in our regular life and you work

01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:52.860
at it and you work at it and you work at it.

01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:56.260
You don't necessarily see the fruit of that labor.

01:14:56.260 --> 01:15:02.280
You don't necessarily see the return and the payoff and the completion aspect of it.

01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:05.680
And when it's a project like this and we're moving pretty quick and we're integrating

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.700
those changes and we're deploying them on a pretty regular basis, you could put some

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:10.700
work into it.

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:14.060
And a couple of weeks later, you know, thousands of people are using something you just worked

01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:15.060
on.

01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:17.680
And I think there's something to that, too, that can be kind of satisfying.

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.980
I hope people find it satisfying because we are super grateful.

01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:27.660
And kind of speaking to the thousands of people using it, the stats or the plausible instance

01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:29.580
that Alex deployed is still out there.

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:34.060
So periodically I check that and I'm like, wow, thousands of people are actually using

01:15:34.060 --> 01:15:35.060
it.

01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:36.980
You can actually see the statistics being shown.

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:39.640
You mean it's not just the three of us?

01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.020
And I hope it continues to grow.

01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:42.020
Right.

01:15:42.020 --> 01:15:46.260
Because we've had many, many years of sending people to all of the other websites, the show

01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:52.940
specific websites, YouTube, Twitch, and now we're kind of saying, come back home.

01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:55.300
You know, we've rebuilt the storefront.

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.780
Come on home again.

01:15:56.780 --> 01:16:00.980
And it's going to take a little while to re-habituate people because they, you know, a lot of people

01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:02.380
just listen on their podcast app.

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:05.660
If they're going to go to the website at all, they just bring up the notes and click a link.

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:07.000
They don't even have to go to a website.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.920
But if they do, they go to the show page.

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.100
And I think over time that'll start to change.

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:16.820
As we begin to move away from Fireside too, we'll probably redirect the individual show

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:20.300
sites like a Linux Unplugged or OfficeHours.hair.

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:24.940
We'll probably redirect that to the sub show page on the JB website once things are ready

01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:27.440
and it's time for Fireside to go.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:30.860
So then that will also see in theory a little bit of an increase in traffic when we do that

01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:31.860
as well.

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:34.820
So it's all coming and I'm glad we have something built for them when they get here.

01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:41.100
You know, I'd say I think one of my favorite things about this project has been that it

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:45.500
has given me a new way to hang out with our audience.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:48.740
And we're building something together, which is really fun, too.

01:16:48.740 --> 01:16:53.660
It's not, you know, Chris, we get the feeling often that it's, you know, sometimes we publish

01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:57.760
an episode and you don't always get that feedback that there's someone else out there.

01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:00.180
Or if you do, it's like Twitter or YouTube comments.

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.260
That's what I was saying earlier.

01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:06.580
It's like as a content creator, you get this really weird echo chamber source of your most

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:07.580
feedback.

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:12.260
But the fun part is with this website project, at least for me personally, it's felt like

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:18.580
most of the energy has been in a like a two way exchange is conversations happening.

01:17:18.580 --> 01:17:20.400
And we're building this thing together.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:23.980
And there's a bunch of people like huddled around talking about how to best accomplish

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:26.900
a certain feature or solve some bug or something.

01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:30.700
And it's like, I'm just getting to know our audience members in a totally different way.

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:32.260
And I love that stuff.

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:39.580
And up until we actually had issues with a deployment one time, I hadn't actually seen

01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:42.500
Alex on a video from Self Hosted.

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.060
I hadn't actually seen him before.

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.780
And we hopped on a video call to kind of troubleshoot it out.

01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:50.580
And that was my first time ever actually seeing Alex.

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:54.620
I've heard his voice for years, but that was the first time I had seen it.

01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:58.200
Yeah, that's always an experience.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:02.340
So it's been really cool from my perspective as well, getting actually to I mean, it's

01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:05.700
the whole reason why I ended up getting brought on this specific podcast episode.

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.200
So it's been really cool.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:09.660
It's more of that meetup kind of energy.

01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:14.460
You know, it's that it's that kind of vibe, that meetup vibe a little bit, but, you know,

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:15.460
in a different context.

01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:17.780
All right, gentlemen, we should wrap it up there.

01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:20.300
But thank you for the work today specifically.

01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:24.380
But thank you for all of the work and everybody out there contributing and anybody considering

01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:29.340
you can find the Jupiter Broadcasting dot com repo on our GitHub.

01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:31.300
We'll put a link to that stuff in the show notes as well.

01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:35.540
So you have all of that over at office hours dot hair slash 15.

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:36.540
Heck yeah.

01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:40.380
I have a feeling that they mean I love it, but it's not it's not going to be around forever

01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:41.380
with the name change.

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:42.380
It might have to change.

01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:43.380
I don't know.

01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:44.380
Maybe we should keep it.

01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:48.380
You know, just the domain like so the long timers feel a little Easter egg.

01:18:48.380 --> 01:18:49.380
Yep.

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:50.380
Love it.

01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:51.380
Yeah.

01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:52.380
The old schoolers.

01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:53.380
Yeah, they'll know.

01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:54.380
All right, everybody.

01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:55.380
Thank you very much for joining us.

01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:58.940
That does mean office hours are closed, so you got to get out of here.

01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:01.900
I only got so much room and honestly, I don't like leaving my pants on.

01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:02.900
So you got to go.

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:03.900
You got to go.

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:23.740
Thanks for being here.
