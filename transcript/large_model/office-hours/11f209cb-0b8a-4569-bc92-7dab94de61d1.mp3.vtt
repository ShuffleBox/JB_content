WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.400
So I hope it doesn't distract you,

00:01.400 --> 00:03.700
but the hair is a little off today.

00:03.700 --> 00:05.300
I washed it this morning,

00:05.300 --> 00:08.420
but it was one of the quickest showers

00:08.420 --> 00:09.380
I've probably had in years.

00:09.380 --> 00:11.220
I feel like there might be a story here,

00:11.220 --> 00:13.520
or is that just a new Chris?

00:13.520 --> 00:18.420
No, okay, so you wanna know how you can tell a guy's busy?

00:18.420 --> 00:20.400
When a disaster happens,

00:20.400 --> 00:22.300
and it's like a week and a half later,

00:22.300 --> 00:23.940
and he still hasn't gotten to it yet,

00:23.940 --> 00:25.620
and it's like, no, that's on my list.

00:25.620 --> 00:27.420
It's so funny when people hit me up with stuff.

00:27.420 --> 00:29.100
I'm like, yeah, no, I'll totally get to it.

00:29.100 --> 00:30.140
And they have no concept

00:30.140 --> 00:32.580
of what my to-do list looks like.

00:32.580 --> 00:33.700
Crazy, just crazy.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.820
About a week and a half ago, Brent,

00:36.820 --> 00:38.700
in the town the studio was at,

00:38.700 --> 00:41.540
a water main just exploded,

00:41.540 --> 00:44.340
and the entire roadway became a river.

00:44.340 --> 00:47.580
It was halfway up to trucks deep.

00:47.580 --> 00:49.520
It was seriously deep,

00:49.520 --> 00:54.480
and it just gushed for hours and hours and hours.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.160
Well, I picked the wrong time

00:56.160 --> 00:57.500
to do a load of dishes or something,

00:57.500 --> 01:01.380
because they had to shut off all of the water

01:01.380 --> 01:03.360
to the entire town.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.380
So it's just no water.

01:05.380 --> 01:07.140
And so I'm like, all right, well, screw this,

01:07.140 --> 01:07.980
I'm outta here.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.400
And I took off, and I left, right?

01:09.400 --> 01:11.600
Because, you know, a guy's gotta have water.

01:12.580 --> 01:16.100
I get back the next day, early in the morning,

01:16.100 --> 01:18.120
and the water is still turned off.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.600
I'm like, oh, geez, this is really bad.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.620
And it's also just extremely hot.

01:21.620 --> 01:24.100
So, you know, people wanna water their gardens

01:24.100 --> 01:27.100
and all that kind of stuff, and we've got no water.

01:27.100 --> 01:29.460
And it doesn't even dawn on me

01:29.460 --> 01:31.740
that I had done a load of dishes,

01:31.740 --> 01:34.140
and that I have drained the hot water tank.

01:34.140 --> 01:36.380
Oh, no, I see where this is going.

01:36.380 --> 01:38.380
But there's been no, I assume, right, at this point,

01:38.380 --> 01:41.060
there's been no water to refill the hot water tank.

01:41.060 --> 01:43.660
And so it just ran on empty, I guess,

01:43.660 --> 01:45.060
and it burned itself out.

01:45.060 --> 01:46.980
And this is about a week and a half ago.

01:46.980 --> 01:50.340
And I just, today I got out there

01:50.340 --> 01:52.980
to look at the air lights that are flashing on it.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.140
It's like this Honeywell controller

01:55.140 --> 01:56.640
with seven blinking lights.

01:56.640 --> 01:58.980
So I look up seven blinking lights, right,

01:58.980 --> 02:00.660
for the controller, you know?

02:00.660 --> 02:03.540
That doesn't seem like a normal operating status.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.580
No, trying to conjure the best Google results possible.

02:06.580 --> 02:10.460
And, of course, what I get is turn off the gas

02:10.460 --> 02:12.960
and call a technician.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.140
So I did the right thing, and I just left the gas on,

02:15.140 --> 02:16.980
and I just keep hoping the water heats up.

02:16.980 --> 02:18.940
Oh, my goodness.

02:18.940 --> 02:20.220
I've got time to deal with that.

02:20.220 --> 02:22.460
You know what's extra funny about that, Chris?

02:22.460 --> 02:25.860
Which I feel bad about your situation,

02:25.860 --> 02:26.820
because yeah, that's a totally,

02:26.820 --> 02:28.960
you did the perfect thing to burn that thing out.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.920
So I think the solution is clear.

02:30.920 --> 02:32.580
You need some new elements or something.

02:32.580 --> 02:37.520
But the hilarious part is that for about a week and a half,

02:37.520 --> 02:41.540
I too, here at Alex's, have been having hot water issues.

02:41.540 --> 02:46.540
And his system here is one of those on-demand systems.

02:47.620 --> 02:51.260
And so it gets this blinking like error 12.

02:51.260 --> 02:54.740
And you look at error 12, you know,

02:54.740 --> 02:57.100
and it's a no flame error.

02:57.100 --> 03:01.020
So I've been for like days trying to diagnose this thing.

03:01.020 --> 03:02.160
I had the whole thing apart,

03:02.160 --> 03:05.540
like things unplugged and like all sorts of stuff.

03:05.540 --> 03:07.220
And so Alex was like, you know what?

03:07.220 --> 03:08.040
It's not worth your time.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.260
I'll just call a technician.

03:09.260 --> 03:10.140
It's totally fine.

03:11.020 --> 03:15.420
And it has been since last Tuesday,

03:15.420 --> 03:19.100
which is about, well, that's exactly a week

03:19.100 --> 03:22.740
since we've been trying to coordinate a technician

03:22.740 --> 03:23.560
just to show up.

03:23.560 --> 03:26.380
Twice they were scheduled and never showed up.

03:26.380 --> 03:29.500
And I, oh, you know that feeling.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.140
And it just gets me going.

03:31.140 --> 03:33.700
And I, anyways, I just got a message

03:33.700 --> 03:34.660
as we're recording here.

03:34.660 --> 03:37.180
Apparently Alex has set up something else.

03:37.180 --> 03:38.940
Third time's a charm, right?

03:38.940 --> 03:41.180
Oh man, so we're both taking cold showers this week.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.140
That's what you're saying?

03:42.140 --> 03:43.460
Oh, this morning shower.

03:43.460 --> 03:45.260
Yeah, I think I'm a little better than you

03:45.260 --> 03:48.020
in that I get about, if I reset the thing,

03:48.020 --> 03:50.860
I get about six and a half minutes of hot water

03:50.860 --> 03:52.360
before it starts erroring out.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.540
So I've got these showers timed now.

03:54.540 --> 03:57.020
Oh yeah, you could do a shower in six and a half minutes.

03:57.020 --> 03:58.740
I'm doing this shower in three minutes,

03:58.740 --> 04:00.460
so you could do that.

04:00.460 --> 04:01.620
That's why I'm half shaven,

04:01.620 --> 04:04.780
so that I don't have to spend extra minutes.

04:04.780 --> 04:07.580
It's Office Hours with me, Chris.

04:11.700 --> 04:14.860
Hello everybody, welcome on into the office.

04:14.860 --> 04:16.500
We are getting ourselves prepared

04:16.500 --> 04:18.300
best we can with sponge baths this week

04:18.300 --> 04:23.300
because we got lots to talks about.

04:23.940 --> 04:24.780
You know what, Brent?

04:24.780 --> 04:25.620
Come on in, get in here.

04:25.620 --> 04:26.620
Come on, you smell great, by the way.

04:26.620 --> 04:27.460
You smell great.

04:27.460 --> 04:28.500
Hello, hello.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.820
Oh, good, yeah, we'll smell great together.

04:30.820 --> 04:31.780
That's great, thanks.

04:31.780 --> 04:33.300
It's been a rough week.

04:33.300 --> 04:34.940
It's been a real rough week.

04:34.940 --> 04:36.340
This is a drinking episode.

04:36.340 --> 04:39.980
I should have brought a drink with me.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.420
I had a drink before this show,

04:41.420 --> 04:43.180
but I should have brought one in here

04:43.180 --> 04:46.100
so I could get proper sauce for this episode.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.660
By sauce, do you mean hydrated, right?

04:48.660 --> 04:49.500
No.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.020
Oh, okay, okay, okay, got it, clear.

04:51.020 --> 04:55.300
No, I mean barely, barely able to speak.

04:55.300 --> 04:56.980
A sure sign that it's gonna be a bad week

04:56.980 --> 04:59.700
is if you see something missing from an RSS feed,

04:59.700 --> 05:01.420
if a webpage doesn't load,

05:01.420 --> 05:02.580
you know, it's an inconvenience for you

05:02.580 --> 05:03.940
because you wanna listen to your podcast,

05:03.940 --> 05:07.780
but for me, it's like a crisis, you know?

05:07.780 --> 05:11.100
And it's just, we had service provider outages

05:11.100 --> 05:12.580
totally outside our control,

05:12.580 --> 05:14.020
and then we had some of the tools

05:14.020 --> 05:17.100
that we've built over the years fail us a little bit,

05:17.100 --> 05:19.340
and the two things just kind of came together

05:19.340 --> 05:24.060
at different times to just make it a really stressful week.

05:24.060 --> 05:27.400
And it's a bummer because everybody works so hard,

05:27.400 --> 05:31.340
so when the systems fail, you feel like it extra hurts

05:31.340 --> 05:34.020
because you hit your mark, everybody did their thing,

05:34.020 --> 05:36.260
everybody contributed their piece.

05:36.260 --> 05:40.340
We did everything in the right order on time,

05:40.340 --> 05:43.060
which is, you know, it's a thing when you're,

05:43.060 --> 05:44.300
you know, you got a weekly cadence.

05:44.300 --> 05:47.380
It's a well-oiled machine, I will say, from week to week.

05:47.380 --> 05:49.020
And so it's an accomplishment

05:49.020 --> 05:51.420
when we all hit our mark every single time,

05:51.420 --> 05:54.300
every single week, and we do it for years on end.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.820
Every time we do it, I'm proud of the entire team,

05:56.820 --> 05:59.260
you know, and we have this little Slack channel

05:59.260 --> 06:01.340
that we have that when the automation system

06:01.340 --> 06:03.580
publishes an episode, it lands in there

06:03.580 --> 06:04.900
as like this episode has now gone out,

06:04.900 --> 06:06.780
and every single time, I think, you know,

06:06.780 --> 06:09.420
this is such a great team, and they've worked really hard.

06:09.420 --> 06:12.220
And then a component fails,

06:12.220 --> 06:16.020
and it's like no matter how well everyone executed

06:16.020 --> 06:18.780
in the entire chain, it didn't matter

06:18.780 --> 06:21.260
because it still didn't go out, right?

06:21.260 --> 06:26.060
It's like, it's just, it's the worst feeling in the world.

06:26.060 --> 06:28.060
Outages happen, and so this week,

06:28.060 --> 06:31.060
I wanted to talk a little bit about early decisions

06:31.060 --> 06:32.820
people make when they're building their stack

06:32.820 --> 06:36.220
that just influence the way things run for years after.

06:36.220 --> 06:39.180
And also, I wanted to talk a little bit about

06:39.180 --> 06:42.140
where we draw the line on what we self-host

06:42.140 --> 06:45.740
versus what we decide to let somebody else host,

06:45.740 --> 06:48.740
what we automate versus what we do manually,

06:48.740 --> 06:51.940
because whenever there's an outage like this

06:51.940 --> 06:54.800
that's both in the hosting end and in the tooling end,

06:54.800 --> 06:56.020
this is something I reflect on,

06:56.020 --> 06:57.460
and I just wanted to share that with you guys

06:57.460 --> 07:00.340
while it's still fresh and raw a little bit.

07:00.340 --> 07:04.740
But before we get there, I think you and I need to talk

07:04.740 --> 07:06.920
a little positive stuff, a little community stuff,

07:06.920 --> 07:10.900
because this morning, you messaged me on a show day

07:10.900 --> 07:14.420
asking me to elevate your privileges on the Meetup site

07:14.420 --> 07:15.900
so that way you could do something with the Meetups.

07:15.900 --> 07:16.820
I have no idea what.

07:16.820 --> 07:19.060
I just took your word for it and gave you the rights.

07:19.060 --> 07:20.420
I didn't even ask you what you're doing.

07:20.420 --> 07:23.620
I know when to ask, so you just go, yep, done.

07:23.620 --> 07:25.780
Whatever you need, whatever you need.

07:25.780 --> 07:27.460
Well done then, sir.

07:27.460 --> 07:28.620
So what's going on?

07:28.620 --> 07:30.660
I know we have the London Meetup

07:30.660 --> 07:34.300
just the day after this episode posts publicly,

07:35.140 --> 07:37.780
and I know you're also kinda doing some low-key stuff

07:37.780 --> 07:40.180
over there in Raleigh, so update us.

07:40.180 --> 07:41.740
Give me something good.

07:41.740 --> 07:42.980
Give me something to be happy about.

07:42.980 --> 07:45.020
Well, it occurred to me as I was looking at the calendar

07:45.020 --> 07:47.620
that I have been here a little while and I'm leaving soon,

07:47.620 --> 07:48.980
and it was always my intention

07:48.980 --> 07:51.540
to do a little tiny micro Meetup.

07:51.540 --> 07:54.060
I didn't wanna create a big, huge thing

07:54.060 --> 07:56.820
and take away from the Meetups like the London Meetup

07:56.820 --> 07:58.820
because it's happening about the same time.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.980
So I thought a great way to connect with people

08:02.980 --> 08:05.100
would be to create a little matrix room

08:05.100 --> 08:08.500
in our matrix server dedicated to Raleigh, the environment,

08:08.500 --> 08:10.420
because I remember when we had the Meetup here,

08:10.420 --> 08:14.100
we were really impressed at how wonderful everybody was

08:14.100 --> 08:16.820
and everybody was like exchanging phone numbers and email

08:16.820 --> 08:20.460
and all the other probably more modern technologies

08:20.460 --> 08:21.500
to stay connected.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.180
And we thought, hey, wouldn't it be great

08:24.180 --> 08:27.060
if we create a permanent space where everyone who's here

08:27.060 --> 08:29.260
and everyone who couldn't make it but is in the area

08:29.260 --> 08:31.300
could stay in contact?

08:31.300 --> 08:33.340
And it occurred to me that that might,

08:33.340 --> 08:35.940
my excuse to wanna hang out with some of these people

08:35.940 --> 08:38.260
on this trip would be a great way to kick that off.

08:38.260 --> 08:41.860
So you mentioned giving me elevated privileges

08:41.860 --> 08:43.140
to meetup.com.

08:43.140 --> 08:45.780
All I did was I sent a message out to everyone

08:45.780 --> 08:48.860
who attended the last Meetup here in Raleigh

08:48.860 --> 08:52.860
and invited them to join our matrix room.

08:52.860 --> 08:54.180
Get a little something going.

08:54.180 --> 08:55.020
Get a little something going.

08:55.020 --> 08:58.460
So I did notice like a minute and a half

08:58.460 --> 09:00.740
after I sent that message out, people started streaming in.

09:00.740 --> 09:02.340
So I think it's working.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.980
I haven't quite checked out on it recently,

09:04.980 --> 09:06.100
but I think we're doing all right.

09:06.100 --> 09:09.820
So my end goal for this week, of course,

09:09.820 --> 09:11.980
Office Hours is coming out on Friday.

09:11.980 --> 09:14.300
So if you're listening to this,

09:14.300 --> 09:16.420
you're gonna have to really speed yourself up.

09:16.420 --> 09:18.500
But I'm hoping to have a little tiny,

09:18.500 --> 09:20.900
maybe a restaurant meetup this weekend.

09:20.900 --> 09:24.260
I'm open to hearing what people suggest

09:24.260 --> 09:25.220
and we'll see what happens.

09:25.220 --> 09:27.140
And I'll report back when it happens.

09:27.140 --> 09:30.220
When we create these new matrix rooms,

09:30.220 --> 09:32.100
and I know it can be hard to keep track of,

09:32.100 --> 09:35.340
we have what's called a space, a Jupiter broadcasting space.

09:35.340 --> 09:37.700
It's a directory of all of these rooms.

09:37.700 --> 09:40.460
So when we make a new Raleigh meetup space

09:40.460 --> 09:42.900
or the West Coast crew meetup space,

09:42.900 --> 09:44.980
we are putting these in a space

09:44.980 --> 09:46.780
where you can just look at that one space.

09:46.780 --> 09:48.820
I'll put a link in the show notes if I remember.

09:48.820 --> 09:49.660
Help me remember, Brent.

09:49.660 --> 09:51.100
Sure.

09:51.100 --> 09:53.020
And once you look at that space,

09:53.020 --> 09:55.260
it's a directory of all these different rooms.

09:55.260 --> 09:58.820
And we were talking on the stream before we started the show,

09:58.820 --> 10:02.180
Brent and I, and I know Wes and Alex feel the same way,

10:02.180 --> 10:05.380
are of the opinion that Raleigh is an area

10:05.380 --> 10:07.220
of the United States that Jupiter Broadcasting

10:07.220 --> 10:10.020
wants to invest in, just from like a community standpoint.

10:10.020 --> 10:13.340
Because, I mean, we had nearly 200 people

10:13.340 --> 10:15.500
at the meetup when we went there.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.580
There were people from all areas of the tech industry.

10:18.580 --> 10:21.180
So we got a really broad representation

10:21.180 --> 10:23.060
of both the free software side of the industry

10:23.060 --> 10:25.700
and also the commercial side of the industry.

10:25.700 --> 10:30.140
And it just felt like an area that was worth going back to.

10:30.140 --> 10:32.380
So this Raleigh room that we've created

10:32.380 --> 10:35.980
is kind of like what we're doing with the London meetup.

10:35.980 --> 10:37.980
Alex is going out there, he's the tip of the spear,

10:37.980 --> 10:40.420
he's gonna kind of create a community over there.

10:40.420 --> 10:42.900
He's gonna kind of create the pathways

10:42.900 --> 10:45.220
for organizing a meetup over there.

10:45.220 --> 10:47.540
And then that's something that if it's successful,

10:47.540 --> 10:50.940
we can build upon, and we can do more of down the road.

10:50.940 --> 10:54.220
And it's my intention, although who knows,

10:54.220 --> 10:56.540
I am a dad of three young children,

10:56.540 --> 10:57.700
and travel is crazy right now,

10:57.700 --> 11:00.380
but it's my intention over time to do more

11:00.380 --> 11:01.220
of this kind of stuff,

11:01.220 --> 11:04.580
to do more going to places where industry is

11:04.580 --> 11:06.180
and going to places where listeners are

11:06.180 --> 11:08.540
because we have some really well-connected,

11:08.540 --> 11:11.520
really informed listeners that are deep into this stuff.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.420
And I can gain a lot of knowledge and experience from that

11:14.420 --> 11:16.020
that I can share with the rest of the audience

11:16.020 --> 11:17.540
that we can put on the air.

11:17.540 --> 11:19.660
And so it's something that we wanna continue to do.

11:19.660 --> 11:21.060
And I think Raleigh is gonna be

11:21.060 --> 11:22.780
one of our key areas going forward.

11:22.780 --> 11:25.480
So if you're out there, join the room.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.780
We'll put a link in there in the show notes at

11:27.780 --> 11:31.020
officehours.hair slash nine.

11:31.020 --> 11:33.300
And then you can find the link in there and join up.

11:33.300 --> 11:35.660
And even if it's after you've heard this,

11:35.660 --> 11:36.660
maybe you're hearing this a little bit

11:36.660 --> 11:39.180
after Brent's in town, we'll be back.

11:39.180 --> 11:41.420
Yeah, the idea is for the room to be a long-term thing.

11:41.420 --> 11:43.580
So if you've missed me, don't worry,

11:43.580 --> 11:45.020
I'll be back at some point.

11:45.020 --> 11:48.880
But the idea is to also just enable you all to connect

11:48.880 --> 11:49.820
while we're not there as well.

11:49.820 --> 11:52.620
So use the room freely, it's yours, it's a gift.

11:52.620 --> 11:54.220
I do have a few stats for you, Chris.

11:54.220 --> 11:58.540
So I think I made that room maybe two hours ago,

11:58.540 --> 12:00.740
three hours ago, and there are already 10 people in there.

12:00.740 --> 12:03.800
So that's something, I mean, you and I are in there,

12:03.800 --> 12:04.900
so maybe that doesn't quite count.

12:04.900 --> 12:09.900
But also I wanted to compare,

12:10.940 --> 12:13.680
we had such a great success out here in Raleigh.

12:13.680 --> 12:16.060
And on the meetup page, I did notice that there were about

12:16.060 --> 12:19.500
just slightly over a hundred people who RSVP'd to that.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.700
And I'd noticed that for the London meetup,

12:21.700 --> 12:24.220
we're at like 116.

12:24.220 --> 12:27.460
So I think Alex might have to keep that in mind

12:27.460 --> 12:30.380
when he's organizing last minute for the London meetup.

12:30.380 --> 12:32.100
I think it's gonna be a huge success.

12:32.100 --> 12:35.420
Yeah, you and I know that 116 means 200.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:37.140 --> 12:38.320
It's funny, it's funny, right?

12:38.320 --> 12:43.320
Because like 60 will mean 40 and over 100 means 200.

12:44.420 --> 12:47.560
It's just the way these things work, it's the strangest thing.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.460
But that's definitely something I've learned over the years.

12:50.460 --> 12:52.900
Good, I think he's gonna have a blast.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.020
Me too, I'm feeling pretty jealous over here.

12:55.020 --> 12:58.700
I hope he gets so charged up for like another year

12:58.700 --> 13:01.540
of self-hosted podcasts, because I know you and I

13:01.540 --> 13:03.260
get super charged up from these events.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.580
He also made those new stickers he brought with him,

13:05.580 --> 13:08.500
so we'll see how the feedback goes with that.

13:08.500 --> 13:11.260
Oh boy, I hope it goes smooth.

13:11.260 --> 13:12.300
By the time this comes out,

13:12.300 --> 13:15.220
it's just gonna be absolutely days away.

13:15.220 --> 13:17.660
I have so many things I could talk to you about,

13:17.660 --> 13:19.220
but I wanted to talk about this outage

13:19.220 --> 13:20.900
that we had Monday night.

13:20.900 --> 13:24.640
Earlier this week, every single show page was down.

13:24.640 --> 13:26.400
Every single show page.

13:28.020 --> 13:30.780
Every show, every site.

13:30.780 --> 13:32.300
That's why we have our own website now.

13:32.300 --> 13:33.820
Oh wait, we didn't do that yet.

13:33.820 --> 13:34.900
Not yet, not yet.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.860
Yeah, we're working on it, we're working on it.

13:36.860 --> 13:39.780
And I wanna say before I get into this too far,

13:40.740 --> 13:43.140
Fireside FM has been a really good service

13:43.140 --> 13:46.180
and it's totally worth the money, even with the outages.

13:46.180 --> 13:49.260
And Dan Benjamin has built a good team over there,

13:49.260 --> 13:51.460
but I've been a Fireside customer

13:51.460 --> 13:52.700
since nearly the beginning.

13:52.700 --> 13:56.980
And a lot of our friends in the Linux podcasting space

13:56.980 --> 13:59.540
noticed and have also started using Fireside.

13:59.540 --> 14:03.020
So I think we've brought a lot of business to Fireside too.

14:03.020 --> 14:05.720
And I would also, although I don't know,

14:07.020 --> 14:09.420
well I guess I do know, I have been emailed,

14:09.420 --> 14:12.700
I've been told by Fireside that we are on the higher end

14:12.700 --> 14:15.780
of amount of downloads that the service gets.

14:15.780 --> 14:19.060
And as a result, for some of our shows,

14:19.060 --> 14:23.540
we pay a very, very high special rate

14:23.540 --> 14:27.120
that isn't publicly listed anywhere on Fireside's page.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.180
But if you get, this is not a humble brag,

14:29.180 --> 14:30.020
it's just the reality.

14:30.020 --> 14:31.220
If you get as many downloads as we do,

14:31.220 --> 14:33.820
you end up getting a note that you gotta pay

14:33.820 --> 14:35.420
or you gotta go.

14:35.420 --> 14:38.740
And so we pay a rate that is beyond what is listed

14:38.740 --> 14:40.220
on the Fireside service.

14:40.220 --> 14:44.620
And for years I felt like I really got what I paid for,

14:44.620 --> 14:46.820
even at the elevated rate.

14:46.820 --> 14:48.020
But now I'm not so sure.

14:49.100 --> 14:50.740
If you look at Fireside's public Twitter page,

14:50.740 --> 14:53.420
I don't think they've even tweeted for a couple of months.

14:53.420 --> 14:55.260
There's features that we have been waiting on,

14:55.260 --> 14:58.900
like network support, podcast network support,

14:58.900 --> 15:01.780
since before our acquisition by Linux Academy,

15:01.780 --> 15:04.640
we were making internal plans to adapt.

15:04.640 --> 15:05.620
And now here we are,

15:05.620 --> 15:08.460
almost three years independent post-acquisition,

15:08.460 --> 15:10.840
and the features still haven't shipped.

15:10.840 --> 15:14.820
I mean, it's just one of those things, right?

15:14.820 --> 15:16.680
Maybe we're the only one asking for it.

15:16.680 --> 15:17.900
I don't know, man.

15:17.900 --> 15:19.000
I don't know.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.300
I think perhaps the attention is focused elsewhere.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.540
Podcasting 2.0 has been a thing,

15:24.540 --> 15:27.260
and initially Fireside was really great.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.500
They've done good chapter support.

15:30.520 --> 15:34.740
They have hosts and guest support in the namespace spec,

15:34.740 --> 15:36.420
which is nice so that way in the show notes

15:36.420 --> 15:38.340
you can see who the hosts of the show are,

15:38.340 --> 15:39.420
who the guests are.

15:39.420 --> 15:41.500
That's part of the podcasting 2.0 spec,

15:41.500 --> 15:45.460
and Fireside supports that, and I am grateful for that.

15:45.460 --> 15:49.360
But the live tag, the social tag, the value tag,

15:49.360 --> 15:50.580
nothing from Fireside.

15:50.580 --> 15:53.280
It's been a couple of years and nothing.

15:54.540 --> 15:56.900
And I've also had situations

15:56.900 --> 16:00.620
where an episode was just totally dead, couldn't download,

16:00.620 --> 16:04.260
and we could see that the page

16:04.260 --> 16:05.700
had been rendered several times,

16:05.700 --> 16:07.240
and by the third time it had been rendered

16:07.240 --> 16:10.060
by the Fireside servers, the download link didn't work.

16:10.060 --> 16:12.020
And I captured that, I documented it,

16:12.020 --> 16:14.240
I submitted it to them in a ticket.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.900
They got back to me two or three days later,

16:15.900 --> 16:17.560
might have been even more than that,

16:17.560 --> 16:20.540
and said, I don't see an issue, hope everything's okay.

16:21.700 --> 16:24.020
Three days of your show being unavailable

16:24.020 --> 16:26.100
to download is killer.

16:26.100 --> 16:28.260
Ultimately we nuked the post, we recreated the post,

16:28.260 --> 16:29.080
and everything worked.

16:29.080 --> 16:31.660
But there's just been weird issues like that.

16:31.660 --> 16:33.460
And so the question that comes up

16:33.460 --> 16:36.020
from the technically savvy audience is,

16:36.020 --> 16:38.220
well guys, why don't you just host this yourself?

16:38.220 --> 16:40.220
Yeah, I know what goes into that question.

16:40.220 --> 16:43.500
It seems like a relatively easy one to ask

16:43.500 --> 16:44.740
and a hard one to answer.

16:44.740 --> 16:47.280
Yeah, and so I thought we'd talk a little bit about that.

16:47.280 --> 16:49.780
And those things do change with time.

16:49.780 --> 16:51.580
There's a post that I'll have linked in the show notes

16:51.580 --> 16:54.260
that I thought was actually pretty wise.

16:54.260 --> 16:56.620
It's called The Disproportionate Influence

16:56.620 --> 16:58.660
of Early Tech Decisions.

16:58.660 --> 17:00.780
The author has a pretty long post,

17:00.780 --> 17:03.180
I'll just give you a couple of highlights here.

17:03.180 --> 17:06.740
He starts, spend five years at a hyper-growth startup

17:06.740 --> 17:09.220
like Stripe, but you could put anything in there.

17:09.220 --> 17:11.300
Any internet-based business I'd say,

17:11.300 --> 17:12.700
even Jupiter Broadcasting.

17:12.700 --> 17:15.420
And you see a lot of changes during that time.

17:15.420 --> 17:18.140
Organizationally it's night and day, that's true for us.

17:18.140 --> 17:21.100
We've gone from big teams, small teams, one person team,

17:21.100 --> 17:24.120
part of a big multi-hundred person company

17:24.120 --> 17:25.280
back to a small team.

17:26.300 --> 17:29.100
Big organizational changes, night and day changes.

17:29.100 --> 17:32.140
We've scaled from a few people to thousands of people,

17:32.140 --> 17:33.780
and the structure has adapted to those teams

17:33.780 --> 17:34.900
and those responsibilities come along.

17:34.900 --> 17:37.980
That's true for JB too, 100% true.

17:37.980 --> 17:39.860
And you look at all of this malleability

17:39.860 --> 17:43.020
in the corporate structure and in the team structure,

17:43.020 --> 17:45.660
and one thing that doesn't change as quickly

17:45.660 --> 17:48.420
is the tech that we've built all of this on.

17:48.420 --> 17:52.420
In fact, even as part of the Linux Academy acquisition,

17:52.420 --> 17:56.040
the core foundation of what made the JB Podcasts available,

17:56.040 --> 17:59.100
what our website ran on, the services that we used,

17:59.100 --> 18:02.380
all of that stuff, that didn't change infrastructure.

18:02.380 --> 18:03.540
That tech didn't change.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.240
Like culturally and organizationally,

18:05.240 --> 18:06.380
things were changing like crazy,

18:06.380 --> 18:10.420
but those tech decisions we made years ago,

18:10.420 --> 18:13.740
they stayed, Fireside remained through all of that, right?

18:13.740 --> 18:16.420
Those were all choices we made before Linux Academy,

18:16.420 --> 18:18.920
and even though there is a drive in those organizations

18:18.920 --> 18:21.340
to standardize, standardize, standardize,

18:21.340 --> 18:24.660
you don't tend to really change those early tech decisions.

18:24.660 --> 18:27.180
You're just constantly building around them

18:27.180 --> 18:29.940
because you gotta keep moving forward.

18:29.940 --> 18:33.120
The author writes, a common theme in all of these companies,

18:33.120 --> 18:35.700
we all knew that these were imperfect implementations

18:35.700 --> 18:38.060
even when they were originally added.

18:38.060 --> 18:40.820
They were added anyway in the name of velocity

18:40.820 --> 18:42.580
with implicit assumptions baked in

18:42.580 --> 18:45.260
that they'd be shored up and improved later

18:45.260 --> 18:48.420
when there were more resources and slack time to do so.

18:49.500 --> 18:51.880
And although they certainly were shored up,

18:51.880 --> 18:54.700
they were never improved by all that much.

18:54.700 --> 18:59.100
Another common theme is that they have lived far longer

18:59.100 --> 19:03.300
than their progenitors would have ever expected.

19:03.300 --> 19:06.260
As it turned out, that slack time is chronically

19:06.260 --> 19:10.520
a vanishing rare luxury in an engineering organization,

19:10.520 --> 19:13.180
and software is always hard to change

19:13.180 --> 19:16.380
once it's firmly cemented in place.

19:16.380 --> 19:17.640
Doesn't that ring true?

19:17.640 --> 19:20.340
Yeah, it made me think, Wes has been a darling

19:20.340 --> 19:23.500
and he's been posting all of his discoveries

19:23.500 --> 19:25.020
as he's trying to solve some of these problems.

19:25.020 --> 19:26.620
It's like a play-by-play.

19:26.620 --> 19:29.020
And there's some stuff in there that even you were like,

19:29.020 --> 19:31.740
oh, I don't think we need that part anymore.

19:31.740 --> 19:33.280
That's been there for a while.

19:33.280 --> 19:36.140
And there's some, I don't know,

19:36.140 --> 19:38.540
generational stuff in there that just lives on.

19:38.540 --> 19:41.180
Yeah, and in a lot of ways, it's like,

19:41.180 --> 19:43.820
as long as it works, you just keep moving forward.

19:43.820 --> 19:45.540
After the Linux Academy acquisition,

19:45.540 --> 19:48.620
we took a pass at automating certain tasks.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.180
And I wanna talk to you guys about this a little bit,

19:50.180 --> 19:52.100
and then we'll circle back to all of this.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.020
I think there's two school of thoughts.

19:55.180 --> 19:58.620
One is you do everything by hand.

19:58.620 --> 20:01.000
And I like this school of thought, I get it.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.340
It's artisan in a way, right?

20:02.340 --> 20:04.220
Everything is handcrafted.

20:04.220 --> 20:07.780
You record the show, you edit the show,

20:07.780 --> 20:10.100
you post the show, you do all of that yourself.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.300
You make the WordPress post,

20:11.300 --> 20:12.920
you create the RSS feed entries,

20:12.920 --> 20:15.540
you post it manually in all the different destinations,

20:15.540 --> 20:16.740
all the different sites.

20:17.640 --> 20:19.340
You manually render out each piece.

20:19.340 --> 20:21.000
You do every single step.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.580
Maybe you got a checklist, maybe you just intuitively know it.

20:23.580 --> 20:24.720
You just do all of it.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.660
And there's a lot that I find appealing there.

20:28.660 --> 20:32.020
From a creative standpoint, it's ultimate control.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.140
It's beautiful.

20:34.140 --> 20:37.320
It's like everything is exactly how I intended.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.640
It's ultimate control.

20:40.060 --> 20:42.180
But it doesn't scale.

20:42.180 --> 20:43.980
There's a critical scaling issue there, right?

20:43.980 --> 20:46.120
It's a one person thing.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.360
And anything that you wanna maintain for years,

20:48.360 --> 20:49.980
and I've been doing this for 15 years,

20:49.980 --> 20:52.100
anything you wanna maintain,

20:52.100 --> 20:54.820
something like that just gets so tedious

20:56.620 --> 21:00.800
that eventually you begin to actually hate the task.

21:02.060 --> 21:04.460
You resent having to do the task.

21:04.460 --> 21:06.700
And when we were acquired by Linux Academy

21:06.700 --> 21:10.220
and we brought on a bunch of the team members as full time,

21:12.220 --> 21:15.820
I was like 12, 13 years into every single episode,

21:15.820 --> 21:18.300
I create a WordPress post, I create an RSS feed,

21:18.300 --> 21:22.120
I do all of it manually, and I was just done.

21:23.020 --> 21:25.020
I couldn't do another one.

21:25.020 --> 21:28.060
Like it just, I had reached a wall.

21:28.060 --> 21:31.940
And I was pushing through it because it had to get done.

21:31.940 --> 21:34.680
But by doing so, I was building a resentment.

21:34.680 --> 21:38.660
And that's when I realized long term,

21:38.660 --> 21:40.500
you gotta automate some of this stuff.

21:42.020 --> 21:44.840
And while that seems like a great idea on the surface,

21:44.840 --> 21:46.220
you give up some of the things

21:46.220 --> 21:49.660
about that handcrafted artisan control.

21:49.660 --> 21:53.840
You give up that I touch every single step.

21:54.820 --> 21:56.960
There's a good side and a bad side to that.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.500
The bad side is you lose that handcrafted touch

22:00.500 --> 22:01.340
for everything.

22:02.420 --> 22:05.620
The good side is you don't screw it up as much.

22:06.860 --> 22:09.860
Because if you can do it with automation,

22:09.860 --> 22:12.780
you can do it over and over and over again

22:12.780 --> 22:14.580
exactly like it should be done,

22:14.580 --> 22:18.400
with a level of perfection that a human doing the task

22:18.400 --> 22:19.380
just simply can't.

22:19.380 --> 22:22.060
And you get scalability, and you get standardization,

22:22.060 --> 22:23.780
and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

22:23.780 --> 22:25.860
So we automated a lot of these things.

22:25.860 --> 22:28.180
But every now and then, that system breaks down.

22:28.180 --> 22:32.340
And it kinda makes you rethink this entire philosophy.

22:32.340 --> 22:35.020
And that's where we were at this last week.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.660
I think, Brent, in part, we realized,

22:36.660 --> 22:38.340
okay, we need to tweak this, we need to tweak this.

22:38.340 --> 22:40.900
But where I'm at now is it doesn't mean

22:40.900 --> 22:42.900
that automating the rendering of the shows

22:42.900 --> 22:45.180
and automating the posts and automating the creation

22:45.180 --> 22:48.820
of the RSS feeds, I don't think that is a bad idea.

22:48.820 --> 22:51.460
I think it just, occasionally, it needs refinement

22:51.460 --> 22:53.020
as we make changes.

22:53.020 --> 22:57.380
And it also means that sometimes we make mistakes,

22:57.380 --> 23:00.900
and those mistakes go out, like we had several shows

23:00.900 --> 23:02.540
that just didn't post to the all show feeds.

23:02.540 --> 23:04.460
They're like ripple mistakes, right?

23:04.460 --> 23:06.620
Yeah, that's the downside, right?

23:06.620 --> 23:09.460
And there's parallels with Ansible here, don't you think?

23:09.460 --> 23:11.680
Ooh, that is interesting.

23:11.680 --> 23:15.420
Yeah, I think one thing I like about Ansible, for instance,

23:15.420 --> 23:17.420
is that someone else could go in and read the stuff.

23:17.420 --> 23:19.220
But the whole time you've been just talking,

23:19.220 --> 23:22.940
it has reminded me in both instances,

23:22.940 --> 23:26.840
both the artisan creator does everything instance,

23:26.840 --> 23:28.700
but also this automation instance.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.700
One thing we've run up against a few times

23:30.700 --> 23:34.500
is that typically one person is the knowledge keeper

23:34.500 --> 23:36.620
of how it's built or how it works

23:36.620 --> 23:39.740
or how to solve the problems for the edge cases.

23:39.740 --> 23:42.740
And that's what I'm interested in tackling.

23:42.740 --> 23:46.420
It's like, how do we fix that part of it?

23:46.420 --> 23:50.900
And it sort of feels like that was a decision we made

23:50.900 --> 23:54.020
for velocity purposes, right?

23:54.020 --> 23:57.420
That was a technical decision we made a few years ago

23:57.420 --> 24:00.620
for velocity's sake that today we're like, oh.

24:00.620 --> 24:03.660
And it's not even fair to them, so I agree.

24:03.660 --> 24:06.320
There is probably some areas we could tweak there too.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.860
But I also feel like those lessons we've learned as a team,

24:09.860 --> 24:12.060
we've applied to the website.

24:12.060 --> 24:13.340
You and I, just before the show started,

24:13.340 --> 24:15.780
we were talking about a fix that needed to be made.

24:15.780 --> 24:19.460
And the sequence of events is gamma put in the poll request,

24:19.460 --> 24:22.220
you made the change, I commented on the need.

24:22.220 --> 24:23.260
That's true.

24:23.260 --> 24:25.960
It's gone from like one person can do it, right,

24:25.960 --> 24:27.460
to now like all of us are involved.

24:27.460 --> 24:29.400
And so I think we are applying that lesson

24:29.400 --> 24:30.580
to the future stuff we're building,

24:30.580 --> 24:32.180
to the stuff we're building today,

24:32.180 --> 24:34.020
which is good because I think that's the only way

24:34.020 --> 24:35.580
we can scale.

24:35.580 --> 24:38.700
But there's something inspiring about this website project.

24:38.700 --> 24:40.860
It's bringing the community together

24:41.980 --> 24:45.240
in a way that's like better than ever before.

24:45.240 --> 24:47.700
Like we're really building something awesome here.

24:47.700 --> 24:50.400
Like the stuff that's being built,

24:50.400 --> 24:52.620
another podcaster could absolutely take

24:52.620 --> 24:56.220
and build a system where they are their own infrastructure.

24:56.220 --> 24:58.820
As long as they're comfortable using Hugo,

24:58.820 --> 24:59.800
there's something out here.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.140
I love that, right?

25:01.140 --> 25:05.180
It's like I feel like even though we do make mistakes

25:05.180 --> 25:07.120
and we are living with some technical debt,

25:07.120 --> 25:09.760
it does feel like we are absorbing the lessons from it.

25:09.760 --> 25:10.600
You agree?

25:10.600 --> 25:11.420
I do.

25:11.420 --> 25:12.980
I think it's a path.

25:12.980 --> 25:14.580
It's gonna take a little while to get to.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.460
For instance, the RSS is like the thing

25:16.460 --> 25:20.320
we're both most careful about changing

25:20.320 --> 25:24.220
and also perhaps needs changing the most.

25:24.220 --> 25:25.060
Yeah.

25:25.060 --> 25:27.180
So it's like a tricky balance there.

25:27.180 --> 25:29.780
And so anybody listening to this,

25:29.780 --> 25:32.080
their initial question would be,

25:32.080 --> 25:34.520
well, why don't you just get the new website to do the RSS?

25:34.520 --> 25:35.740
And what would you say to that?

25:35.740 --> 25:37.180
Well, that was the, that was like,

25:37.180 --> 25:38.220
everyone's like, yeah, we'll just have the new,

25:38.220 --> 25:39.340
yeah, oh, you gotta get the fixed fees.

25:39.340 --> 25:40.640
We'll just have, yeah, we'll have the,

25:40.640 --> 25:41.660
yeah, Hugo can do it.

25:41.660 --> 25:46.660
And funny, like 15 years ago when I launched all this,

25:46.740 --> 25:48.640
guess what I had generate the RSS feeds?

25:48.640 --> 25:50.080
The website.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.020
Of course.

25:51.020 --> 25:51.860
Right?

25:51.860 --> 25:52.700
Yeah.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.860
It's a natural thing you do, right?

25:54.860 --> 25:56.020
You make a website post,

25:56.020 --> 25:57.460
you might as well have that be the RSS thing.

25:57.460 --> 25:58.620
And then I don't have to make a bunch of posts.

25:58.620 --> 26:00.060
Like it just seems obvious.

26:00.060 --> 26:01.540
But then there's millions of reasons.

26:01.540 --> 26:03.860
You realize later that you have to do custom feeds.

26:03.860 --> 26:06.220
People want multiple different types of feeds.

26:06.220 --> 26:09.020
Video feed, this, you know, you got MP3 feeds.

26:09.020 --> 26:10.380
Back then we also had MP4 feeds.

26:10.380 --> 26:11.220
You got member feeds.

26:11.220 --> 26:12.180
You got ad free feeds.

26:12.180 --> 26:14.200
You got live stream feeds.

26:14.200 --> 26:15.680
You got, yeah, all show feeds.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.460
You got, it's just, there's a lot.

26:18.460 --> 26:20.020
What have we done to ourselves?

26:20.020 --> 26:21.580
And there's a lot of mix and match there.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.160
And then of course there's new features we want to add.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.100
And a lot of these platforms

26:26.100 --> 26:27.940
that auto generate the feeds for you,

26:28.940 --> 26:31.100
take years to get those new features.

26:31.100 --> 26:31.940
Years.

26:31.940 --> 26:33.300
And well, we want to be out ahead of everybody.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.740
We don't want to be launching that stuff

26:35.740 --> 26:37.100
at the same time everybody else is.

26:37.100 --> 26:38.220
How boring is that?

26:38.220 --> 26:39.100
Right.

26:39.100 --> 26:43.660
For a podcast, the RSS feed, it's our radio signal.

26:43.660 --> 26:44.720
That is our signal.

26:46.020 --> 26:48.740
The RSS feed matters so much, right?

26:48.740 --> 26:50.320
Because that's what powers all the podcast players.

26:50.320 --> 26:53.780
Once you're subscribed, it's the RSS feed that matters.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.260
So we got to have complete control over that.

26:56.260 --> 26:58.300
And we got to do it the right way.

26:58.300 --> 26:59.820
And right now we're looking at a system

26:59.820 --> 27:03.000
where we generate the feed using automation

27:03.000 --> 27:04.860
because I don't want to mess it up.

27:04.860 --> 27:08.140
I know I will get it right 90% of the time,

27:08.140 --> 27:10.540
maybe even 95% of the time.

27:10.540 --> 27:15.420
And I know this because before like three years ago,

27:16.280 --> 27:18.260
we were manually generating all our RSS feeds.

27:18.260 --> 27:20.580
We used to manually generate all of the feeds.

27:21.540 --> 27:24.140
After I decided the website couldn't handle anymore,

27:24.140 --> 27:26.620
I had to move over to manually generating them.

27:26.620 --> 27:29.460
And for the most part, I got it right.

27:29.460 --> 27:32.620
And there was very few issues, but there were issues.

27:32.620 --> 27:34.900
And when you have a problem with RSS,

27:34.900 --> 27:36.220
it's like there's no going back

27:36.220 --> 27:38.440
because it gets cached everywhere.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.300
Podcast players, they save it locally.

27:40.300 --> 27:41.780
They download stuff.

27:41.780 --> 27:43.380
You don't know like how they're going to handle

27:43.380 --> 27:45.100
a new entry in the feed to replace a file.

27:45.100 --> 27:45.940
They all do it differently.

27:45.940 --> 27:47.660
It's like, there's no going back.

27:47.660 --> 27:52.180
And so we decided to switch to hosted RSS feed generation

27:52.180 --> 27:54.380
with Fireside because it's pretty flawless,

27:55.360 --> 27:57.140
but it just doesn't have the features we want anymore.

27:57.140 --> 27:58.180
So now we want to do it right.

27:58.180 --> 27:59.620
We got to, and you got to host it right

27:59.620 --> 28:02.140
because it's a file that gets slammed all the time

28:02.140 --> 28:05.300
as everybody's, you know, you got hundreds of thousands

28:05.300 --> 28:08.500
of podcast catchers out there checking an XML file

28:08.500 --> 28:10.980
and they're checking it all the time.

28:10.980 --> 28:11.980
Oh man.

28:11.980 --> 28:14.200
So you really got to build that in a clever way

28:14.200 --> 28:16.420
where it's cached appropriately,

28:16.420 --> 28:17.780
but it's not done in such a way

28:17.780 --> 28:19.420
that prevents you from doing quick updates

28:19.420 --> 28:21.140
if there's a mistake or you're going live

28:21.140 --> 28:23.980
and you want to announce that it's very complicated.

28:23.980 --> 28:25.780
It's one of the more complicated things we have to do,

28:25.780 --> 28:27.660
but we'll solve it.

28:27.660 --> 28:30.060
And that's why the website can't be responsible

28:30.060 --> 28:31.140
for generating the RSS feed.

28:31.140 --> 28:34.940
I mean, that is like 10% of the reason why the RSS,

28:34.940 --> 28:37.620
why the website can't, it's not even like,

28:37.620 --> 28:39.340
that's not even, that's not even the rest of it.

28:39.340 --> 28:42.060
It's just 10% of the reason, yeah.

28:42.060 --> 28:44.260
But it's something you got to figure out as time goes on.

28:44.260 --> 28:46.940
The website project is going really well though, Brent,

28:46.940 --> 28:48.180
and you want to give us a brief update

28:48.180 --> 28:52.380
and maybe like your best case scenario for going live

28:52.380 --> 28:54.780
and maybe your worst case scenario for it going live?

28:54.780 --> 28:56.820
Ooh, okay.

28:56.820 --> 28:57.860
There's a lot here.

28:57.860 --> 29:01.460
I have been having a ton of fun,

29:01.460 --> 29:05.620
as we mentioned the last office hours, with the website,

29:05.620 --> 29:06.860
but not the website itself,

29:06.860 --> 29:09.540
because I actually haven't been that involved

29:09.540 --> 29:10.900
with the code itself.

29:10.900 --> 29:13.100
It seems like I don't even need to do that.

29:13.100 --> 29:17.340
But I've been just organizing some of the tasks

29:17.340 --> 29:19.020
and helping organize people.

29:19.020 --> 29:22.900
But my favorite part has been the little community

29:22.900 --> 29:24.780
that we've built around this website.

29:24.780 --> 29:27.980
It's like, you know, we have a matrix room dedicated to it.

29:27.980 --> 29:31.820
Everybody in there has been amazing and hilarious as well.

29:31.820 --> 29:34.660
And it's been super fun just to be a part of that.

29:34.660 --> 29:37.620
I've heard repeatedly from people that have said,

29:37.620 --> 29:39.380
oh, this is finally such a great way

29:39.380 --> 29:41.020
for me to give back to JB.

29:41.020 --> 29:43.300
And I can't always do it monetarily,

29:43.300 --> 29:45.700
but I can do it with, you know,

29:45.700 --> 29:47.780
commits to the repos, for instance.

29:47.780 --> 29:50.660
We have, I think I tallied it recently.

29:50.660 --> 29:54.660
We've got like 20 authors now who've submitted commits.

29:54.660 --> 29:57.060
And there's over 200 commits to the repo.

29:57.060 --> 30:00.580
And I think that's kind of an amazing thing.

30:00.580 --> 30:03.260
So I think that's been going really amazingly well.

30:03.260 --> 30:06.500
I think better than we could have even imagined.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.740
And it's been smooth, no issues.

30:08.740 --> 30:10.500
Everybody's been working really well

30:10.500 --> 30:12.180
and in an organized fashion.

30:12.180 --> 30:15.540
So like, there are no duplicates of effort

30:15.540 --> 30:17.580
and somebody's work is not being thrown out

30:17.580 --> 30:20.100
because, you know, we had already solved that problem

30:20.100 --> 30:21.900
a week ago, for instance.

30:21.900 --> 30:24.740
So it's been actually working surprisingly well.

30:24.740 --> 30:27.300
I've been very, very pleased.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.580
And I wanna just put out a big thanks

30:29.580 --> 30:31.020
to everyone who's gotten involved.

30:31.020 --> 30:32.700
And if you wanna get involved, there's still time.

30:32.700 --> 30:36.380
Cause we have, I've put out what I'm gonna call

30:36.380 --> 30:40.900
a soft deadline for us to go live in just about two weeks.

30:40.900 --> 30:42.980
So that's August 15 ish.

30:44.140 --> 30:47.780
And that is strategic because our real deadline

30:47.780 --> 30:50.820
is not for another two weeks, but forget I just said that.

30:50.820 --> 30:53.820
Because really we wanna get it live as soon as possible.

30:53.820 --> 30:56.260
I was going through the number of tickets

30:56.260 --> 30:58.740
for our first milestone this morning

31:00.140 --> 31:01.220
and we're doing pretty good.

31:01.220 --> 31:02.580
I think we can get through it.

31:02.580 --> 31:04.660
So with a little bit more effort

31:04.660 --> 31:07.780
and a little bit of concentrated, you know, time,

31:07.780 --> 31:09.580
I think we can totally get there.

31:09.580 --> 31:12.220
So my best case scenario, I'm gonna put this out there,

31:13.460 --> 31:14.380
is two weeks from now.

31:14.380 --> 31:15.900
So on the 15th of August,

31:17.300 --> 31:20.700
our worst case scenario would be like rushing at the deadline

31:20.700 --> 31:24.380
and I think Chris, if you haven't like misled us,

31:24.380 --> 31:27.020
I think the deadline is the end of the month, so.

31:27.020 --> 31:29.660
Yeah, and I think the sooner the better

31:29.660 --> 31:34.220
because you and myself and the JB backend team,

31:34.220 --> 31:36.220
we need to turn our focus to the road trip

31:36.220 --> 31:37.060
as soon as possible.

31:37.060 --> 31:39.460
So that- Oh yeah, bad project.

31:39.460 --> 31:41.900
Right, so there's that issue too.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.420
And then of course we don't wanna be problem solving

31:44.420 --> 31:45.620
during the road trip.

31:45.620 --> 31:50.620
Yeah, so I would say one thing you could do right away

31:50.940 --> 31:51.780
for those listening,

31:51.780 --> 31:52.620
one thing you could do right away

31:52.620 --> 31:55.100
is go to jupiterbroadcasting.net.

31:55.100 --> 31:57.700
If all you do is go there and play for five minutes

31:57.700 --> 31:59.660
and try to break the thing

31:59.660 --> 32:02.060
and then let someone know how you broke it if you did,

32:02.060 --> 32:02.980
that would be wonderful.

32:02.980 --> 32:05.140
Or if there's some feature you would love,

32:05.140 --> 32:08.980
if there's some, you know, thing missing maybe

32:08.980 --> 32:11.060
or even something that you think

32:11.060 --> 32:13.500
is a really great implementation, we'd love to hear it.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.700
So the best way to give that feedback,

32:16.580 --> 32:18.300
if it's an issue that you think, you know,

32:18.300 --> 32:20.300
should be recorded and someone needs to fix,

32:20.300 --> 32:21.740
GitHub would be the best place for that.

32:21.740 --> 32:23.660
But if it's just some comments,

32:23.660 --> 32:26.780
join the Jupiter website group on Matrix.

32:26.780 --> 32:27.620
We'll have a link to that

32:27.620 --> 32:29.940
and just send in your feedback there.

32:29.940 --> 32:32.860
But yeah, fuzzy testing is really what we need

32:32.860 --> 32:33.700
at this point.

32:33.700 --> 32:34.780
It's exciting.

32:34.780 --> 32:37.700
If we make your optimistic deadline,

32:39.140 --> 32:40.620
I mean, even if we're around it,

32:40.620 --> 32:44.020
I think this will be the most impressive community project

32:44.020 --> 32:45.740
that JB's ever done.

32:45.740 --> 32:46.580
Don't you think?

32:46.580 --> 32:47.420
I really do.

32:47.420 --> 32:50.740
I think it might already be, you know.

32:50.740 --> 32:54.540
I think what's wonderful, and this is very selfish of me,

32:54.540 --> 32:57.740
but what's wonderful is I could just get up in the morning

32:57.740 --> 32:59.420
and sit at my computer with my coffee.

32:59.420 --> 33:01.540
Well, it's not really coffee, it's usually tea.

33:01.540 --> 33:04.660
And just like dream up the features I want on the website

33:04.660 --> 33:07.100
and I just like, you know, type them away.

33:07.100 --> 33:10.780
And then, so sometimes I do do this till like 2 a.m.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.540
in the morning and I wake up the next morning

33:12.540 --> 33:14.820
and someone's already implemented the features.

33:14.820 --> 33:16.860
It's like the most fabulous thing.

33:16.860 --> 33:20.140
And I gotta say, like, that's such a cool thing

33:20.140 --> 33:22.700
that we're building, you know, in open source fashion

33:22.700 --> 33:24.980
and people are really excited to get involved, so.

33:24.980 --> 33:27.980
And what a great demonstration of value for value

33:27.980 --> 33:29.020
while we're talking,

33:29.020 --> 33:30.940
while this has been our conversation recently.

33:30.940 --> 33:32.020
Well said.

33:32.020 --> 33:34.620
Another example of the type of value for value contribution

33:34.620 --> 33:38.620
that will pay dividends for years for us, years.

33:38.620 --> 33:43.180
And I hope we end up with things a lot more up to date

33:43.180 --> 33:44.500
and current on this new website.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.060
Like when we start up the stream for office hours

33:47.060 --> 33:49.380
on Tuesdays, every other Tuesday,

33:49.380 --> 33:52.420
jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar for your local time,

33:52.420 --> 33:54.940
we like, we'll tell people like join our mumble room, right?

33:54.940 --> 33:56.620
And get in the matrix chat room.

33:56.620 --> 33:58.780
And to do that, go to this website

33:58.780 --> 34:00.940
to get these instructions and to do the other thing,

34:00.940 --> 34:03.780
go to this other place to get these other instructions.

34:03.780 --> 34:05.460
And it's just, and then not only that,

34:05.460 --> 34:07.940
but like the instructions aren't even necessarily current

34:07.940 --> 34:09.260
over at that other website.

34:09.260 --> 34:10.740
It's embarrassing.

34:10.740 --> 34:12.300
It's very embarrassing.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.020
It's like the kind of thing, like when you do it,

34:14.020 --> 34:14.900
it's all great.

34:14.900 --> 34:17.700
But like two years later, it's out of date.

34:17.700 --> 34:21.300
And what I love about what the new website offers us

34:22.220 --> 34:24.380
is because of this GitHub workflow,

34:24.380 --> 34:26.380
if an audience member notices something,

34:26.380 --> 34:27.780
A, they can just open up an issue,

34:27.780 --> 34:32.780
but B, a lot of us can just contribute to that page,

34:32.780 --> 34:35.340
update that page on GitHub, save it,

34:35.340 --> 34:37.460
and then a GitHub action will render it out

34:37.460 --> 34:40.180
on the actual JB website and update

34:40.180 --> 34:42.620
like the matrix information page or the mumble page.

34:42.620 --> 34:43.740
It's amazing.

34:43.740 --> 34:44.660
Huge for us.

34:44.660 --> 34:47.460
I think that's actually my favorite feature

34:47.460 --> 34:48.740
about all of this.

34:48.740 --> 34:51.660
I've sort of given it to myself to accomplish,

34:51.660 --> 34:54.460
oh, the mumble page, I think it was the matrix page

34:54.460 --> 34:55.740
is out of date since we moved servers.

34:55.740 --> 34:57.700
And we, nobody went and changed that.

34:57.700 --> 35:00.420
So on the new website, there was a ticket

35:00.420 --> 35:04.500
that I put in there eons ago to update that information.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.100
And nobody was working on it

35:06.100 --> 35:07.580
because I had self-assigned myself.

35:07.580 --> 35:08.940
And then I wasn't even working on it,

35:08.940 --> 35:10.660
which is mildly embarrassing.

35:10.660 --> 35:12.100
But a day or two ago, I was like, okay,

35:12.100 --> 35:12.940
someone else take this.

35:12.940 --> 35:14.140
I'm not doing a very good job,

35:14.140 --> 35:15.500
but I think I've described it enough

35:15.500 --> 35:16.940
that it's pretty clear what needs to happen.

35:16.940 --> 35:20.780
And what ended up happening was someone very quickly

35:20.780 --> 35:23.300
just grabbed it up and said, oh yeah, I could work on that.

35:23.300 --> 35:26.500
And they came out with a version of the tutorial

35:26.500 --> 35:29.100
for how to subscribe to our matrix servers.

35:29.100 --> 35:33.220
That was like far better than what I envisioned

35:33.220 --> 35:34.940
and could have come up with.

35:34.940 --> 35:39.580
It made me realize that maybe the best people

35:39.580 --> 35:42.540
to be making the pages to serve the listeners

35:42.540 --> 35:45.340
are the listeners because they're the audience

35:45.340 --> 35:47.460
who has to take in this information.

35:48.820 --> 35:50.660
There was just a moment there where I went,

35:50.660 --> 35:52.540
oh man, this is such a great thing we're building.

35:52.540 --> 35:54.460
And the best thing is that listeners

35:54.460 --> 35:55.620
can get directly involved

35:55.620 --> 35:58.340
and implement the features they want as well.

35:58.340 --> 36:00.220
That's such a great insight.

36:00.220 --> 36:01.060
Like who would know better

36:01.060 --> 36:03.020
than the people using it themselves?

36:03.020 --> 36:04.220
That's not us.

36:04.220 --> 36:06.060
That's not how we interact with this.

36:06.060 --> 36:08.420
Like if we want to listen to a show,

36:08.420 --> 36:11.100
I mean, a lot of times I will actually just go to the website

36:11.100 --> 36:12.020
and I'll listen to a show.

36:12.020 --> 36:15.060
But also like I've got the flack files,

36:15.060 --> 36:18.140
like it just, I don't interface with any of this

36:18.140 --> 36:19.500
the same way the audience does.

36:19.500 --> 36:22.020
Well, and I think there are a variety of different people

36:22.020 --> 36:24.580
who interact with our, let's call them services, right?

36:24.580 --> 36:26.140
Like you and I interact with them,

36:26.140 --> 36:28.260
but in a certain way we have a certain perspective.

36:28.260 --> 36:29.900
But there are new listeners,

36:29.900 --> 36:32.820
there are listeners who've been with us for a decade.

36:32.820 --> 36:34.780
There are listeners who are experts

36:34.780 --> 36:38.740
at implementing matrix or are brand new to matrix.

36:38.740 --> 36:41.740
And both of those perspectives need to be sort of heard

36:41.740 --> 36:42.980
in implementing these features.

36:42.980 --> 36:47.580
So I think we've tripped on a good thing here.

36:47.580 --> 36:49.620
Yeah, and there's people that are noticing stuff

36:49.620 --> 36:52.220
that like would never be on my radar.

36:52.220 --> 36:55.580
Like this is one that I love

36:55.580 --> 36:57.860
that you mentioned, you opened up here,

36:57.860 --> 37:00.740
making the host and the guest page layout identical.

37:00.740 --> 37:05.580
Of course they should be just from a UI standpoint

37:05.580 --> 37:10.580
or Team Linux 01 created an issue to integrate IPFS.

37:11.700 --> 37:14.180
I am absolutely on board with supporting IPFS,

37:14.180 --> 37:16.860
but I just don't have the time or really the passion

37:16.860 --> 37:17.940
to build those features in.

37:17.940 --> 37:20.300
But I'm totally on board with JB supporting that.

37:20.300 --> 37:22.860
Yeah, there've been a few blue sky ideas

37:22.860 --> 37:24.620
that have been thrown into this list.

37:24.620 --> 37:25.620
And I think it's wonderful

37:25.620 --> 37:28.580
because we can capture them while they're still fresh.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.220
And maybe we won't get to them in this next month

37:31.220 --> 37:33.300
for this first version of the website,

37:33.300 --> 37:35.500
but that's completely fine

37:35.500 --> 37:38.780
because as long I think as we record them there,

37:38.780 --> 37:40.140
like there's another one I see there,

37:40.140 --> 37:42.300
light and dark theme switching.

37:43.540 --> 37:46.540
We've always just defaulted to dark themes for JB stuff

37:46.540 --> 37:49.100
because I think we're serving ourselves.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.740
But a switch would be, I think,

37:51.740 --> 37:53.380
not the hardest thing to implement

37:53.380 --> 37:56.140
and would be really great for just usability for everybody.

37:56.140 --> 37:57.500
So that's another idea that's like,

37:57.500 --> 37:59.260
oh yeah, we can get to that in the near future.

37:59.260 --> 38:01.260
And it's really great to record there.

38:01.260 --> 38:04.260
So if anyone has some extra ideas for the website,

38:04.260 --> 38:05.900
they might even be crazy.

38:05.900 --> 38:07.860
Just throw them in there, throw them in the mix

38:07.860 --> 38:09.300
and we'll see what happens.

38:09.300 --> 38:13.220
Yeah, so we have the jupiterbroadcasting.com project

38:13.220 --> 38:16.660
on the main Jupyter Broadcasting GitHub page

38:16.660 --> 38:18.900
if you wanna file an issue.

38:18.900 --> 38:20.700
But really we'd love to just get your eyes

38:20.700 --> 38:22.860
on jupiterbroadcasting.net.

38:22.860 --> 38:24.580
That's the project site.

38:24.580 --> 38:28.300
That's the development site, jupiterbroadcasting.net.

38:28.300 --> 38:30.980
Maybe use that to listen to the next few podcasts,

38:30.980 --> 38:33.540
give it a try for maybe the next few days.

38:33.540 --> 38:35.860
And then if you run into something, let us know about it.

38:35.860 --> 38:38.540
Or if you just have some thoughts, some general feedback

38:38.540 --> 38:40.180
and you'd like to get involved in the conversation,

38:40.180 --> 38:42.540
like Brent said, we've got that matrix room,

38:42.540 --> 38:43.660
which we'd love to have you in there

38:43.660 --> 38:45.780
and chatting with us about.

38:45.780 --> 38:46.620
That's great.

38:46.620 --> 38:49.580
And again, massive thank you, everyone.

38:49.580 --> 38:52.340
It is a popular topic of conversation internally.

38:52.340 --> 38:53.860
How awesome all of you are.

38:53.860 --> 38:54.700
It's true.

38:54.700 --> 38:55.620
Can't say it enough.

38:55.620 --> 38:57.180
We'll have to make some t-shirts.

38:57.180 --> 38:58.820
All right, so I woke up this morning

38:58.820 --> 39:00.620
to a bit of feedback that I wanna talk about

39:00.620 --> 39:01.500
on the show today.

39:02.740 --> 39:05.100
And I want us to kind of chew this a little bit

39:05.100 --> 39:07.700
and have a real honest conversation about it

39:07.700 --> 39:10.700
because I think it's probably something

39:10.700 --> 39:12.020
that's on some people's mind.

39:12.020 --> 39:16.060
So I wanna talk about the boosts across all the JB shows,

39:16.060 --> 39:16.900
the good and the bad,

39:16.900 --> 39:20.340
and why I think people are probably getting tired of them.

39:20.340 --> 39:22.460
And if they are getting tired of them,

39:22.460 --> 39:24.140
why I think they're probably wrong.

39:24.140 --> 39:26.300
And I'll give you my case.

39:26.300 --> 39:27.140
It's not a judgment call,

39:27.140 --> 39:29.100
but I'll make my case for you here in a little bit.

39:29.100 --> 39:32.340
But first, I wanna say holler over to Linode.

39:32.340 --> 39:34.540
Linode.com slash Jupiter.

39:35.420 --> 39:37.860
Linode is investing right here in office hours

39:37.860 --> 39:41.060
because they wanna invest in the community.

39:41.060 --> 39:42.100
I mean, this isn't like, come on,

39:42.100 --> 39:44.100
this isn't gonna be JB's biggest show.

39:44.100 --> 39:47.500
And Linode is savvy enough to know that.

39:47.500 --> 39:49.420
But they also know that the community

39:49.420 --> 39:51.740
is worth investing in, that it pays dividends.

39:51.740 --> 39:54.140
And that's also why they're making our road trip

39:54.140 --> 39:55.620
possible again this year.

39:55.620 --> 39:58.380
So go to linode.com slash Jupiter

39:58.380 --> 40:01.420
and get $100 in 60 day credit over at Linode.

40:01.420 --> 40:02.340
And you support the show.

40:02.340 --> 40:05.500
It's where we host everything that we do publicly now.

40:05.500 --> 40:10.100
Linode also has a bunch of really nice advanced features.

40:10.100 --> 40:13.100
They support Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible.

40:13.100 --> 40:15.580
They have a really clean, simple API

40:15.580 --> 40:18.620
that already has a bunch of pre-created libraries

40:18.620 --> 40:22.060
for Python and for Rust and for all the things.

40:22.060 --> 40:24.940
They also have a command line client that is choice.

40:24.940 --> 40:26.340
I really love that.

40:26.340 --> 40:28.740
In fact, a little pro tip,

40:28.740 --> 40:31.180
install the Linode command line client

40:31.180 --> 40:34.500
on your actual Linode machine, right?

40:34.500 --> 40:37.260
So then when you're SSHed into your Linode box,

40:37.260 --> 40:40.060
you could create a snapshot of that very box

40:40.060 --> 40:42.460
on that box before you do a system update.

40:43.780 --> 40:44.980
Just take it to the next level, guys.

40:44.980 --> 40:46.180
It's really easy.

40:46.180 --> 40:47.500
And of course they have great things

40:47.500 --> 40:50.580
like S3 compatible object storage,

40:50.580 --> 40:52.660
which you could always use as the seed for,

40:52.660 --> 40:54.020
I don't know, R2.

40:54.020 --> 40:57.700
And then you could just like have the most insane,

40:57.700 --> 41:02.660
great CDN with incredible reach at great prices.

41:02.660 --> 41:05.100
Oh, and by the way, Linode 30 to 50% cheaper

41:05.100 --> 41:06.700
than the hyperscalers out there.

41:07.700 --> 41:09.980
But there's a lot of ways you can host,

41:09.980 --> 41:11.380
but none of them are as good as Linode.

41:11.380 --> 41:12.300
They've got the best support.

41:12.300 --> 41:13.260
They got the best performance.

41:13.260 --> 41:14.820
They got 11 data centers

41:14.820 --> 41:18.780
and nobody else invests deep into the community,

41:18.780 --> 41:22.500
into the media, into the events, into the projects,

41:23.940 --> 41:25.660
even into things like road trips

41:25.660 --> 41:28.220
that just connect all of us together.

41:28.220 --> 41:29.500
Who else is doing that?

41:29.500 --> 41:30.980
Nobody.

41:30.980 --> 41:33.740
So go to linode.com slash Jupiter,

41:33.740 --> 41:36.980
support the show, say thanks for your support

41:36.980 --> 41:39.500
and get that $100 to mess around.

41:39.500 --> 41:40.340
It's pretty fun.

41:40.340 --> 41:43.620
Linode.com slash Jupiter.

41:43.620 --> 41:46.620
So I imagine now that we've been doing the boosts

41:46.620 --> 41:49.540
for a little while and they've been getting more popular,

41:49.540 --> 41:52.340
that there is going to be a group of people out there

41:52.340 --> 41:55.220
that are getting kind of sick and tired of the boosts.

41:55.220 --> 41:58.020
And I heard from some of them this morning

41:58.020 --> 41:59.100
in our matrix chat room.

41:59.100 --> 42:01.740
And I wanna talk about it here on the show

42:01.740 --> 42:02.700
because I get it, right?

42:02.700 --> 42:04.140
They've been around for a little while

42:04.140 --> 42:06.300
and they described it as boost fatigue.

42:07.300 --> 42:10.780
And I dug into it and I think it's worth us analyzing

42:10.780 --> 42:12.340
because I think they're wrong.

42:12.340 --> 42:14.620
And if you feel the same way,

42:14.620 --> 42:16.980
I think you might also wanna reconsider,

42:16.980 --> 42:18.540
but we'll talk about it.

42:18.540 --> 42:20.100
You let me know.

42:20.100 --> 42:20.980
So here's what I got.

42:20.980 --> 42:21.900
Is it just me?

42:21.900 --> 42:23.340
This was a, I won't mention who it is,

42:23.340 --> 42:25.100
but I think they probably represent

42:25.100 --> 42:26.060
a handful of folks out there.

42:26.060 --> 42:27.980
They say, is it just me?

42:27.980 --> 42:31.420
Or has anyone else got a bit of boost fatigue?

42:31.420 --> 42:34.620
Not just boost, but everything related to crypto as well

42:34.620 --> 42:37.420
in recent Jupiter broadcasting shows.

42:37.420 --> 42:40.060
So let's talk about this because I do think right about now

42:40.060 --> 42:42.140
is just about when everybody's gonna be kind of getting,

42:42.140 --> 42:44.660
if you're tired of it, you're tired of it about now.

42:44.660 --> 42:46.100
So this is the time to talk about it.

42:46.100 --> 42:50.100
And when I talk to these individuals in our matrix room,

42:51.500 --> 42:53.300
I ask them, okay, so if these were messages

42:53.300 --> 42:56.100
that were attached to a PayPal donation

42:56.100 --> 42:59.140
or emails that were just from our members,

42:59.140 --> 43:01.700
from like the unplugged core or the Jupiter party,

43:01.700 --> 43:03.540
if these were just emails from members

43:04.580 --> 43:06.220
that we were reading on the show,

43:06.220 --> 43:08.220
does it bug you as much?

43:08.220 --> 43:10.300
And the general response I got was no.

43:10.300 --> 43:12.780
I think what bugs me about the boosts

43:12.780 --> 43:15.420
is that they're associated with SATs.

43:16.260 --> 43:19.780
SATs, Satoshis, are crypto.

43:19.780 --> 43:22.980
And they don't like crypto.

43:22.980 --> 43:25.820
And I completely understand that perspective

43:25.820 --> 43:28.460
because I don't like crypto.

43:28.460 --> 43:32.180
And I will tell you right here, right now,

43:33.260 --> 43:35.860
when I engage in these conversations with the audience,

43:35.860 --> 43:38.340
one of the things I struggle with is

43:38.340 --> 43:42.100
when people refer to Bitcoin as crypto,

43:42.100 --> 43:47.020
I find it ignorant and triggering, right?

43:47.020 --> 43:50.620
It's like saying that you checked out Hannah Montana Linux,

43:50.620 --> 43:53.260
and because Hannah Montana Linux is such a joke,

43:53.260 --> 43:55.940
you're never gonna use Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

43:55.940 --> 43:58.900
So as a Linux user, that would upset you, right?

43:58.900 --> 44:00.620
I feel triggered.

44:00.620 --> 44:05.500
Yeah, so it's when you have a technical understanding

44:05.500 --> 44:09.020
of these different projects, these crypto projects,

44:09.020 --> 44:11.900
and you have a monetary understanding

44:11.900 --> 44:15.500
of these crypto projects, it's a triggering thing.

44:15.500 --> 44:20.020
It is like comparing RHEL or Ubuntu

44:20.020 --> 44:23.820
to Hannah Montana Linux, and I am not exaggerating at all.

44:23.820 --> 44:26.540
That is, and so when you understand the technicals,

44:26.540 --> 44:30.180
it's like, okay, all right,

44:30.180 --> 44:31.660
I'm gonna engage in this conversation,

44:31.660 --> 44:32.980
but they don't even really understand

44:32.980 --> 44:34.620
what they're talking about.

44:34.620 --> 44:36.980
And I don't mean to sound insulting.

44:36.980 --> 44:40.180
I have been following Bitcoin since 2010

44:41.060 --> 44:43.060
from a technical standpoint.

44:43.060 --> 44:47.780
That's 12 years I have followed an open source project.

44:47.780 --> 44:52.220
So I have a very deep understanding of Bitcoin, right?

44:52.220 --> 44:55.860
And I have spent the last 10 months

44:55.860 --> 45:00.380
deeply investigating the top 100 crypto projects,

45:00.380 --> 45:01.940
reading their white papers,

45:01.940 --> 45:05.980
tracking down their creators, the developers,

45:05.980 --> 45:07.300
following the communities.

45:08.380 --> 45:10.780
I have gone deep into all of this.

45:11.780 --> 45:14.980
And I have also, over the last year,

45:14.980 --> 45:18.100
been educating myself from a monetary policy standpoint.

45:18.100 --> 45:20.900
So I have a strong monetary policy understanding

45:20.900 --> 45:22.380
of how Bitcoin operates

45:22.380 --> 45:25.180
and how the other crypto projects operate.

45:25.180 --> 45:28.180
So from a monetary standpoint

45:28.180 --> 45:30.220
and from a technical standpoint

45:30.220 --> 45:32.340
and from a community standpoint

45:32.340 --> 45:34.340
and from a licensing standpoint,

45:34.340 --> 45:36.540
I do not consider Bitcoin equivalent

45:36.540 --> 45:38.980
to any of the other cryptocurrencies at all.

45:40.380 --> 45:43.180
And to associate myself with any of them,

45:43.180 --> 45:44.260
I find insulting.

45:45.620 --> 45:46.940
I find it gross.

45:48.060 --> 45:49.820
And so when somebody says,

45:49.820 --> 45:52.340
I don't like it when you talk about crypto,

45:52.340 --> 45:54.500
to imply that I'm talking about those other things,

45:54.500 --> 45:55.980
I find gross and insulting.

45:55.980 --> 45:57.220
And so I have to get past that.

45:57.220 --> 45:58.940
That's like my bias in these conversations

45:58.940 --> 46:02.060
is I have to realize that some people don't realize

46:02.060 --> 46:04.300
they're accusing me of promoting HANA Montana Linux

46:04.300 --> 46:05.140
when they say that,

46:05.140 --> 46:06.900
because they just haven't dug into it, right?

46:06.900 --> 46:09.020
And because people are technical in our community

46:09.020 --> 46:10.460
and they have an understanding of cryptology

46:10.460 --> 46:12.820
and they kind of get blockchain,

46:12.820 --> 46:15.260
they think they understand these projects.

46:15.260 --> 46:17.020
But there's a monetary aspect

46:17.020 --> 46:18.340
and there's a community aspect

46:18.340 --> 46:20.020
and there's a developer aspect

46:20.020 --> 46:21.700
and there's a licensing aspect.

46:21.700 --> 46:25.060
Just like with every other free software project,

46:25.060 --> 46:27.380
the 100% makes a difference.

46:27.380 --> 46:30.300
And Bitcoin is nothing,

46:30.300 --> 46:32.580
nothing like those other projects.

46:32.580 --> 46:35.860
There will never be another project like Bitcoin

46:35.860 --> 46:38.060
because they've all come after Bitcoin.

46:38.060 --> 46:39.660
So they all have a founder.

46:39.660 --> 46:40.860
They all have a core team

46:40.860 --> 46:42.740
that has influence over the project.

46:42.740 --> 46:45.740
They're all going to give out tokens ahead of time.

46:45.740 --> 46:47.620
They're all centralized.

46:47.620 --> 46:50.540
None of them are decentralized like Bitcoin.

46:51.380 --> 46:52.860
Bitcoin's founder is gone.

46:52.860 --> 46:54.620
There's no one person that has influence.

46:54.620 --> 46:56.380
There's no Vitalik, right?

46:56.380 --> 46:58.700
There's no VCs backing Bitcoin

46:58.700 --> 47:02.820
like there is for Solana or all the other cryptos.

47:02.820 --> 47:05.460
And then when you combine the Lightning Network,

47:05.460 --> 47:08.260
which is an open source peer-to-peer payments network

47:08.260 --> 47:10.980
that makes it stupid cheap to do transactions

47:10.980 --> 47:13.740
on top of this free software chain.

47:13.740 --> 47:15.220
And when you understand the difference

47:15.220 --> 47:16.820
between fiat money and hard money

47:16.820 --> 47:20.300
and the difference between tokens and Bitcoin,

47:21.300 --> 47:24.540
to compare the two is ludicrous.

47:24.540 --> 47:27.540
There's massive technical differences.

47:27.540 --> 47:30.580
I hope when we talk about this stuff

47:30.580 --> 47:33.300
that people are giving me some runway

47:33.300 --> 47:37.180
based on my track record of getting this stuff right,

47:38.380 --> 47:39.820
which I don't boast about,

47:39.820 --> 47:43.980
but I have a pretty good track record overall.

47:43.980 --> 47:47.820
And I'm telling you right now,

47:47.820 --> 47:49.780
I've done the homework on this.

47:49.780 --> 47:54.780
Some of this I have been following for 12 years.

47:54.780 --> 47:58.340
And I don't know if you have that same bench of experience

47:58.340 --> 47:59.820
when you tell me you're sick of hearing us

47:59.820 --> 48:01.460
talk about crypto.

48:01.460 --> 48:04.300
But additionally, the shows are not about crypto

48:04.300 --> 48:06.300
and I don't wanna make them about crypto.

48:06.300 --> 48:08.660
So we have, after we were done introducing

48:08.660 --> 48:10.620
the concept of value for value,

48:10.620 --> 48:13.660
and after we were done introducing the concept of boosts

48:13.660 --> 48:15.020
and new podcast apps,

48:15.020 --> 48:17.380
and after we were done setting up our first node

48:17.380 --> 48:19.220
and self-hosting an entire show,

48:19.220 --> 48:22.340
self-hosting a node where we run that lightning network

48:22.340 --> 48:25.860
and self-host all of those boosts locally here on the land.

48:25.860 --> 48:28.220
After we were done talking about that discovery,

48:29.260 --> 48:31.820
we have greatly reduced the amount we were talking about it.

48:31.820 --> 48:33.820
In fact, we really don't talk about it.

48:33.820 --> 48:35.620
We don't describe what a Satoshi is.

48:35.620 --> 48:38.540
We don't really talk about our node anymore.

48:38.540 --> 48:40.300
We don't really mention anything other than

48:40.300 --> 48:41.940
you can go get a new podcast app.

48:43.460 --> 48:45.740
And we've done that to balance it all out.

48:47.380 --> 48:48.780
But what was really kind of at the core here

48:48.780 --> 48:49.940
and what really bothers them about it

48:49.940 --> 48:51.740
is it's associated with Satoshis.

48:52.660 --> 48:56.740
And I can understand that, but I would challenge

48:56.740 --> 48:58.300
that comes from a lack of understanding

48:58.300 --> 48:59.500
of the core technologies.

49:00.380 --> 49:03.380
And there is a very familiar headwind

49:03.380 --> 49:06.460
that I faced 15 years ago when I wanted to talk about Linux

49:06.460 --> 49:09.900
in the Pacific Northwest in Microsoft country.

49:11.460 --> 49:13.020
Very similar kind of headwind.

49:13.020 --> 49:18.020
And very similar thing where chicken free software projects

49:18.540 --> 49:20.380
would be compared to legitimate projects

49:20.380 --> 49:22.100
that had gained real traction.

49:22.100 --> 49:23.780
And people would use that as reasons

49:23.780 --> 49:25.820
to just dismiss Linux altogether

49:25.820 --> 49:27.620
or dismiss free software altogether.

49:29.060 --> 49:32.420
And you have to realize there's nuance in all of this stuff.

49:32.420 --> 49:34.140
It's just the nature of it.

49:34.140 --> 49:38.020
And so I guess I'm asking for a little bit of faith

49:38.020 --> 49:38.860
and runway here.

49:38.860 --> 49:42.900
Now, that said, this isn't a lot of negative feedback.

49:42.900 --> 49:44.820
This is just an open conversation I wanna have.

49:44.820 --> 49:48.260
It's not like this has become like some big resounding issue.

49:48.260 --> 49:49.580
But I think it's worth bringing up now

49:49.580 --> 49:52.780
because I estimate based on my understanding

49:52.780 --> 49:55.940
of content creation that if people are gonna feel fatigue

49:55.940 --> 49:59.020
with it, it's about right now it's gonna be setting in.

49:59.020 --> 50:00.260
That's my estimation.

50:00.260 --> 50:02.380
It's not something I've been hearing from a lot of people.

50:02.380 --> 50:04.820
I heard it from two people in our matrix room today.

50:04.820 --> 50:06.700
But I assume just based on what I understand

50:06.700 --> 50:10.660
about content creation, that now's about the time

50:10.660 --> 50:11.580
this is an issue.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.140
So I wanna address it now head on.

50:15.020 --> 50:17.020
The other feedback I got about the boosts,

50:18.380 --> 50:20.020
which on the majority is positive,

50:20.020 --> 50:22.620
but the other negative feedback I got about the boosts

50:22.620 --> 50:24.540
is that people don't like the soundboard clips

50:24.540 --> 50:25.380
when we do the boosts.

50:25.380 --> 50:27.260
And I totally get that.

50:29.060 --> 50:29.900
It's a show style thing.

50:29.900 --> 50:31.940
Like for example, in self-hosted,

50:31.940 --> 50:33.700
we don't play the soundboard clips.

50:33.700 --> 50:35.180
We don't do it there.

50:35.180 --> 50:38.060
The flip side is a lot of people do really like them.

50:38.060 --> 50:39.300
And people like to play along.

50:39.300 --> 50:41.300
They like to kind of suggest soundboard clips we could play.

50:41.300 --> 50:43.780
Like we just got the over 9,000 clip.

50:43.780 --> 50:45.540
And for some people, it incentivizes them

50:45.540 --> 50:46.540
to try to hit a certain mark.

50:46.540 --> 50:50.140
So that way they can trigger a certain soundboard level.

50:50.140 --> 50:54.460
So it can be a subtle way to encourage higher value boosts.

50:54.460 --> 50:57.100
But it also is a way to kind of break it up, make it fun.

50:57.100 --> 50:59.980
For me, it's a creative expression, right?

50:59.980 --> 51:01.700
I've thought about that a bit.

51:01.700 --> 51:03.660
Because the Linux community isn't really big

51:03.660 --> 51:05.860
on all that kind of stuff in general.

51:05.860 --> 51:09.420
I think the safe thing would be to err on the side of less.

51:09.420 --> 51:12.380
But it's sort of like driving.

51:12.380 --> 51:15.900
I could drive super safe all the time.

51:15.900 --> 51:17.540
And I'd fall asleep.

51:17.540 --> 51:18.860
And I'd get bored.

51:18.860 --> 51:20.380
And I wouldn't do it.

51:20.380 --> 51:23.660
Or I can drive in a way that I find

51:23.660 --> 51:26.420
to be somewhat kind of still safe, but interesting.

51:26.420 --> 51:27.860
Like maybe drive my RV.

51:27.860 --> 51:29.140
That's a big challenge.

51:29.140 --> 51:30.580
I find that really interesting.

51:30.580 --> 51:32.380
Maybe take a back road.

51:32.380 --> 51:34.860
And go around twists and have some fun with it.

51:34.860 --> 51:36.420
I find that a lot more interesting,

51:36.420 --> 51:38.420
a lot more challenging.

51:38.420 --> 51:40.260
So I'm more inclined to do that.

51:40.260 --> 51:41.420
So there's that element too.

51:41.420 --> 51:42.780
But it is always a balance.

51:42.780 --> 51:44.580
And I'm always trying to walk that line.

51:44.580 --> 51:45.980
And I don't want to overindulge.

51:45.980 --> 51:48.060
So that's feedback I take.

51:48.060 --> 51:50.540
And then one person mentioned that on some of the shows

51:50.540 --> 51:53.740
we're increasing the minimum SAT amount to get in,

51:53.740 --> 51:55.860
to get a boost into the show.

51:55.860 --> 51:57.620
And I did that.

51:57.620 --> 52:00.280
I implemented that because some of our shows

52:00.280 --> 52:03.740
we want to keep to a shorter runtime, like self-hosted.

52:03.740 --> 52:06.380
And so we just want to set a minimum threshold there.

52:06.380 --> 52:08.540
But they said that kind of feels like pay

52:08.540 --> 52:10.380
to play a little bit, Chris.

52:10.380 --> 52:13.300
And I can see that point of view.

52:13.300 --> 52:16.000
Even though they're giving me this feedback

52:16.000 --> 52:18.580
and they've inspired this entire segment on the show

52:18.580 --> 52:20.380
using the free matrix platform that we

52:20.380 --> 52:23.220
self-host for our community.

52:23.220 --> 52:24.460
That's always the irony.

52:24.460 --> 52:28.580
I'm always taking this heat in a free feedback form.

52:28.580 --> 52:29.300
But you know.

52:29.300 --> 52:30.680
Well, I think what's true here is

52:30.680 --> 52:33.220
that there are two ways to get in.

52:33.220 --> 52:35.740
One is maybe hitting that threshold, which

52:35.740 --> 52:41.020
is, I think, an unfortunate sign of success, really.

52:41.020 --> 52:45.500
But the other one is if you have a really amazing idea

52:45.500 --> 52:47.100
or piece of feedback or something

52:47.100 --> 52:52.780
with true value in it that really sparks our tinkering

52:52.780 --> 52:57.780
brains, that will just cross the threshold.

52:57.780 --> 52:59.660
It skips to the front of the line.

52:59.660 --> 53:00.580
It does, yeah.

53:00.580 --> 53:01.660
I think that's really it.

53:01.660 --> 53:05.280
It's like, either give us the best piece of feedback

53:05.280 --> 53:08.280
we've seen in the last week, or we'll

53:08.280 --> 53:10.700
read everybody else's that have reached a certain threshold,

53:10.700 --> 53:13.140
because we can't possibly read them all at this time.

53:13.140 --> 53:15.940
And it's just kind of the reality at this point.

53:15.940 --> 53:16.620
It's a hard one.

53:16.620 --> 53:19.340
There's a reality there of showtime is valuable time.

53:19.340 --> 53:20.900
And it's not like the free mechanisms

53:20.900 --> 53:21.940
don't continue to persist.

53:21.940 --> 53:23.520
This is an addition, not a replacement.

53:23.520 --> 53:27.140
Email, Telegram, Matrix, it's all there still.

53:27.140 --> 53:29.140
Mumble room, it's all there.

53:29.140 --> 53:32.020
Some of it is even higher fidelity than the boost.

53:32.020 --> 53:34.620
But there is the element of, yeah, showtime is valuable.

53:34.620 --> 53:36.860
And I think that is kind of worth talking about here.

53:36.860 --> 53:39.260
It's like, if you look at it, every minute

53:39.260 --> 53:41.460
counts in a podcast, especially one

53:41.460 --> 53:43.940
that you're trying to keep like a 45-minute runtime or a 50

53:43.940 --> 53:46.820
minute runtime, or maybe a show you only do twice a month.

53:46.820 --> 53:49.740
So you really got to get that content ratio right.

53:49.740 --> 53:51.020
And so airtime is valuable.

53:51.020 --> 53:52.460
And the nice thing about the boost

53:52.460 --> 53:54.860
is there is a value for value exchange there.

53:54.860 --> 53:56.860
And that's something we can give to the audience.

53:56.860 --> 54:00.340
But it's never meant to replace memberships or other mechanisms

54:00.340 --> 54:00.900
of feedback.

54:00.900 --> 54:02.660
It's meant to be as an additional way

54:02.660 --> 54:04.540
to support the shows.

54:04.540 --> 54:05.380
That's the thing.

54:05.380 --> 54:08.140
And so when we look at all of this feedback,

54:08.140 --> 54:10.860
like one of the things I take away from is like,

54:10.860 --> 54:13.940
I need to come up with a more clever way for the members,

54:13.940 --> 54:18.100
people who are on a membership plan, to give feedback.

54:18.100 --> 54:21.460
Like a way for like a bat line for the members.

54:21.460 --> 54:23.140
I like that.

54:23.140 --> 54:24.900
I didn't even think about it beforehand.

54:24.900 --> 54:26.940
But then it just seems obvious in retrospect.

54:26.940 --> 54:27.740
Like, OK, yeah.

54:27.740 --> 54:30.620
Like we got to make sure the members are taken care of there.

54:30.620 --> 54:33.420
And I've got like other ideas for the members, like swag-wise.

54:33.420 --> 54:35.820
But that, I like, oh, that's the lesson I've learned here

54:35.820 --> 54:38.100
is make the members feel like they've got a bat line too.

54:38.100 --> 54:40.340
So that's something we're going to work on there.

54:40.340 --> 54:43.380
And then we're always tweaking the balance of content

54:43.380 --> 54:45.840
to all of this, and like soundboard clips and all of that.

54:45.840 --> 54:47.700
So it's a process.

54:47.700 --> 54:51.900
And each show we're iterating in real time every single week.

54:51.900 --> 54:54.580
And so sometimes it happens as well.

54:54.580 --> 54:57.500
Probably not to people listen to this show, but to other folks is,

54:57.500 --> 54:58.940
they're two, three months behind.

54:58.940 --> 54:59.900
So they're just getting to the point

54:59.900 --> 55:01.940
where we just discovered Umbral and the fact

55:01.940 --> 55:03.260
that we could self-host all this.

55:03.260 --> 55:04.740
And they're like, oh, my gosh.

55:04.740 --> 55:05.700
Oh, my gosh.

55:05.700 --> 55:07.900
Like, wow, these guys are talking about this a lot.

55:07.900 --> 55:09.980
And it's like you fast forward three months.

55:09.980 --> 55:11.600
And now it's just like we've integrated it.

55:11.600 --> 55:12.260
It's standard.

55:12.260 --> 55:15.420
And we're not really focusing on it as much.

55:15.420 --> 55:16.980
It's just kind of how it goes, Bradley.

55:16.980 --> 55:19.260
OK, Acid Density has something in the chat room here.

55:19.260 --> 55:22.740
My only critique about Boost was it felt at times

55:22.740 --> 55:25.140
like it was being promoted as the only valid way

55:25.140 --> 55:26.620
to contribute.

55:26.620 --> 55:29.340
But that feeling has since faded.

55:29.340 --> 55:31.160
That's a good piece of feedback.

55:31.160 --> 55:33.380
I will agree with that, actually.

55:33.380 --> 55:35.560
I felt that a little bit as well.

55:35.560 --> 55:39.060
And not because that was true.

55:39.060 --> 55:40.540
For Linux Unplugged, for instance,

55:40.540 --> 55:45.020
I'm constantly going through all of the mail

55:45.020 --> 55:47.460
that we get, which some of it is incredibly great.

55:47.460 --> 55:50.700
We don't read it all because it doesn't all fit with the topic.

55:50.700 --> 55:53.820
Or maybe we've moved on, or maybe it's private,

55:53.820 --> 55:55.140
and et cetera, et cetera.

55:55.140 --> 55:59.820
But I do think that in the last four or six months,

55:59.820 --> 56:03.460
we have been putting extra attention on the Boosts

56:03.460 --> 56:07.020
to promote them because we think the technology behind them

56:07.020 --> 56:09.900
is very interesting and because there are some really cool

56:09.900 --> 56:13.180
projects that we're contributing to and with.

56:13.180 --> 56:15.020
And they're contributing back to our website

56:15.020 --> 56:16.600
as well, like Podverse, for instance,

56:16.600 --> 56:19.620
that are doing some really cool things

56:19.620 --> 56:23.300
with open source technologies in the ways that we love.

56:23.300 --> 56:25.940
So it's kind of like the leading edge

56:25.940 --> 56:28.980
of some of this neat technology that's really fun to be a part of.

56:28.980 --> 56:31.540
So I think that criticism is valid,

56:31.540 --> 56:36.420
that it has felt that the Boosts have been taking priority

56:36.420 --> 56:37.900
over some other feedback methods,

56:37.900 --> 56:39.620
but that that has switched recently.

56:39.620 --> 56:42.740
Yeah, and there is also a workflow component here.

56:42.740 --> 56:45.740
So the Boosts came in at the right time

56:45.740 --> 56:48.640
when we really needed a system.

56:48.640 --> 56:52.780
And the beautiful thing here is the Boosts went into a database.

56:52.780 --> 56:56.020
And they have a Rust server that sits in front of that,

56:56.020 --> 56:57.540
and it has an API.

56:57.540 --> 56:58.380
What did you say?

56:58.380 --> 56:59.100
A Rust server.

56:59.100 --> 57:00.300
Yeah, you want me to?

57:00.300 --> 57:00.800
Cool.

57:06.380 --> 57:11.380
And the great thing is that it plugs right into our workflow

57:11.380 --> 57:14.180
because every bit of feedback that comes in is timestamped.

57:14.180 --> 57:17.820
It's got the episode they were listening to, the episode number,

57:17.820 --> 57:20.900
and all of that is extractable from the database

57:20.900 --> 57:24.780
and sortable and organizable and fits right in with our workflow.

57:24.780 --> 57:29.140
But the other thing that is honestly just brilliant about them

57:29.140 --> 57:33.020
is they're read-only until we talk about them on air.

57:33.020 --> 57:35.780
There's not a direct mechanism for us to hit reply.

57:35.780 --> 57:42.980
And so that means I can read all of the Boosts for all of the shows.

57:42.980 --> 57:44.820
But when you get to email, because I either

57:44.820 --> 57:46.980
feel compelled to reply or reply to some of them

57:46.980 --> 57:49.380
or we got to save some of them for the show,

57:49.380 --> 57:55.060
I probably get to about 10% to 20% of the emails that come in because of that.

57:55.060 --> 57:58.820
But I can get to 100% of the Boosts for all the shows.

57:58.820 --> 58:01.980
And in part, it's because they're read-only.

58:01.980 --> 58:04.060
And the other thing is, is they're character-limited.

58:04.060 --> 58:06.700
They're longer than tweets, but they're character-limited.

58:06.700 --> 58:07.860
So it's not a book.

58:07.860 --> 58:09.820
It's not paragraph after paragraph.

58:09.820 --> 58:13.900
And so because it's concise feedback that is read-only,

58:13.900 --> 58:19.500
I can process that signal at 10x the rate I can process emails.

58:19.500 --> 58:23.540
That, Chris, I think is a really valid insight.

58:23.540 --> 58:26.340
I do, whenever I sit down to email, I know it's a process

58:26.340 --> 58:29.580
because I feel like they're two-way communications.

58:29.580 --> 58:35.220
And I always want to try to put a thoughtful reply if we can.

58:35.220 --> 58:38.140
But that also means the opposite, which is that I miss some

58:38.140 --> 58:40.060
and I never get to them and et cetera, et cetera.

58:40.060 --> 58:41.400
And I feel pretty bad about that.

58:41.400 --> 58:44.100
So that is a fascinating insight and I

58:44.100 --> 58:47.860
think says a lot about how archaic email might be.

58:47.860 --> 58:48.740
There's that, right?

58:48.740 --> 58:52.700
And then there's just the element of it

58:52.700 --> 58:57.380
has also led to really great conversations in the shows.

58:57.380 --> 58:59.380
Some of my favorite moments in the shows

58:59.380 --> 59:02.020
have been inspired by a Boost question

59:02.020 --> 59:04.420
that we never would have put in the doc.

59:04.420 --> 59:06.060
We never would have brainstormed.

59:06.060 --> 59:07.620
And then the other thing I've noticed

59:07.620 --> 59:11.860
is it has made us follow up a lot more on things

59:11.860 --> 59:15.860
that we talk about once and then forget to follow up on.

59:15.860 --> 59:18.140
Forget to follow up on how something went

59:18.140 --> 59:20.300
or what happened or like you've seen this happen

59:20.300 --> 59:21.300
several times with the Boost.

59:21.300 --> 59:22.220
It's like, oh, yeah, right.

59:22.220 --> 59:24.000
OK, yeah, here's what happened with that.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.540
Sorry, I forgot to mention that.

59:25.540 --> 59:26.660
That happens all the time.

59:26.660 --> 59:29.140
What's neat is they're one liners for something like that.

59:29.140 --> 59:30.780
They're one liners in our show doc

59:30.780 --> 59:33.200
that usually Wes and I haven't read yet.

59:33.200 --> 59:34.700
But you could just mention quickly

59:34.700 --> 59:37.500
and we can touch on it for the next minute or two

59:37.500 --> 59:41.460
and it's a super efficient method for us, really.

59:41.460 --> 59:44.260
And there's also the element of it

59:44.260 --> 59:46.740
has been a great source of discussion and conversation

59:46.740 --> 59:48.500
during the summer lull.

59:48.500 --> 59:52.920
There is a real drop in productivity

59:52.920 --> 59:55.220
in the free software community in the summer

59:55.220 --> 01:00:01.420
because a lot of the world does this thing called vacation.

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:04.540
Yeah, and they take weeks off at a time.

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:05.780
Weeks off, like some of them.

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:07.780
Like the peak part of the year.

01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:08.620
Yeah, like some of them are taking

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:09.780
like six weeks off at a time.

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:11.340
I don't even know how it works.

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:12.540
And then they come back and they still have a job.

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:13.060
Like, I don't know.

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:14.660
But it sounds like a fantasy world.

01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:18.660
But it turns out outside of the states and other areas,

01:00:18.660 --> 01:00:19.820
there are parts of the world.

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:20.460
And guess what?

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:23.260
Those parts of the world also contribute to free software.

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:27.940
And so guess what happens is you have a measurable drop

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.780
in what's going on in the free software world.

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:32.700
And Joe and I always call it the summer lull.

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:35.740
And it's something he and I talk about because we're always

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.780
ingesting the news as fast as it happens.

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:40.060
So that way, we can talk about it, put it in the right shows,

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:40.940
all that kind of stuff, right?

01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:42.860
He and I are constantly following the news.

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.940
And you could probably chart it with a graph.

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:47.860
In the summer, it just drops.

01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:49.580
There's just less activity going on.

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:53.380
And so normally, we'd have like 40-minute, 30-minute shows.

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:55.220
Like, we just would have shorter shows.

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.700
And so instead, we're having these really great

01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:58.820
conversations.

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.360
And in fact, we're talking about, OK,

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.140
we've got to reduce our runtime.

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:04.100
We're talking about needing to reduce our runtime

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.020
in the summer.

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.220
It's a good problem to have.

01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:06.700
Right.

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:08.660
And so it's just, but if you don't

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:10.200
know what goes into making the show,

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.060
you might not realize that.

01:01:11.060 --> 01:01:13.260
But it's just one of those things where it's like,

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:14.900
this has been a great thing to have in the summer

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.780
because we've got a lot to talk about now.

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:18.580
Like, we can show up knowing there's stuff

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.740
to talk about in the summer.

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:22.460
That's huge.

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:25.260
And also, it happens in the holidays in the winter too.

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.840
You know, you can imagine a lot of people

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:28.580
when they're scratching their own itch,

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:30.820
when there's other things going on like vacation and holidays,

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:31.660
guess what happens?

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:34.300
They focus on other stuff.

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.300
And if you're following the news every single week

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:38.900
because you've got to talk about it on three different shows,

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.420
you notice those kinds of things.

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.540
And the booths have been a tremendous help in that way

01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.040
as well.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.060
Not to mention, and this is the last point,

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:48.860
but this is what I remember being the strongest thing

01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:51.460
that I really felt when we first introduced them.

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.340
It has been years since I felt like I've

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.460
had that kind of connection with the audience,

01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:56.940
especially with the COVID stuff.

01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:00.020
Like, it was like all of a sudden,

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:01.740
a light went on in the darkness.

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.540
Like, I had felt really disconnected.

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:05.460
And I had felt really far.

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:07.900
And you know, especially when like Twitter's going on

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:08.780
and you have Telegram.

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:10.700
And it's like, it only represents

01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.220
a portion of the audience.

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:15.080
And so it's really easy to build this model

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:18.740
of the audience in your head that isn't accurate.

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:20.700
And when you bring in this another source,

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.900
it's just a new source along with the other ones,

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:25.580
it gives you another data point.

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.620
It gives you another source of signal

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.820
to build the appropriate model in your head

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.500
of who you're talking to.

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:36.660
And for me, it has been a tremendously healthy improvement

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.660
to the model I have in my head.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:42.460
It has improved the virtual audience who I am talking to.

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.420
When I'm speaking to the microphone,

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:48.860
I have a better representation and a fonder representation

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:50.660
of the person I am speaking to now.

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.340
Because I'm speaking to this new group who

01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.640
gives me a new data input that is different than what

01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:58.140
I'm getting on Twitter, YouTube, and Telegram, and Matrix,

01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.100
and stuff like that.

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:01.540
And email.

01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:04.660
And for me, as a content creator,

01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.740
the fact that this can come in a dashboard

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:09.020
where there has to be a bit of a monetary exchange

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.660
to get it in front of me.

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:13.820
And so we're both paying a cost.

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:17.220
I'm paying my time, my energy, my emotional investment.

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.920
In fact, this is my business, and this

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.300
is what I'm spending my time on.

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:21.480
Those are my costs.

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:24.460
And there's the sat cost for the person to send the message in.

01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:27.420
And so we both have a little bit of skin in the game.

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:31.740
It tremendously improves the level of feedback that we get.

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:32.520
Good and bad.

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:34.380
The negative stuff, we absolutely

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:37.860
get critical feedback and the positive feedback.

01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:42.140
It is a step above what we get.

01:03:42.140 --> 01:03:43.860
And what we traditionally email, I'd say,

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:47.600
is the next best signal in terms of thoughtfulness and barrier.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:48.940
It takes you a little bit of work

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:50.900
to actually send an effing email.

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:53.020
And then you have the contact form.

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:55.220
And then you have Telegram and Matrix.

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:56.620
And then you have Twitter.

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:59.640
And then you have YouTube comments and Reddit comments.

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:01.900
And as you go down that stack, there's

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:04.580
sometimes good stuff anywhere in that stack,

01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:07.040
but often it declines in quality.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.420
And so for me, somebody post-pandemic

01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:10.940
who's used to doing meetups and has

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.820
been lived in this social bubble for a while

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:16.580
now to get this new signal that we're both of us

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.260
have some skin in the game.

01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:21.760
And so the quality, the duration, and the workflow

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.180
are all better.

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:26.020
And there's actually some monetary exchange there too.

01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:28.180
So it's like even when I get bad news,

01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.840
there's a little bit of sugar with it.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:30.380
You know what I'm saying?

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:32.660
Like that medicine goes down a little bit better.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.260
And last but not least, I know I keep saying this,

01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:38.660
but it's a shift.

01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:42.460
Podcasting will never be the same again.

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:45.360
The number one advantage YouTube has

01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.460
over going off and doing a podcast

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.540
is if you are successful on YouTube,

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:52.540
there is a guaranteed path to monetization.

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:54.520
The platform will monetize for you.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.460
You just got to get the views.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:59.740
That's not how podcasting works.

01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:01.860
You got to get the views or the listens,

01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:03.900
and you got to go get the money.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:04.880
You got to do sales.

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.420
You got to do something.

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:08.020
You got to do both pieces.

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:11.860
You don't just show up and podcast and get a big podcast

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:12.460
and make money.

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:14.500
In fact, it is all cost.

01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.420
It is all cost, right?

01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:18.500
Google pays for everything on YouTube.

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:20.920
But for podcasting, you're paying for the distribution.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.260
You're paying for the hosting.

01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:23.780
You're paying for the domain name.

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:26.180
You're paying for everything, right?

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:27.420
Google's got you over there.

01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:29.940
And then they're going to help you monetize it, too.

01:05:29.940 --> 01:05:32.100
That's pretty attractive.

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:34.580
But you see what it creates.

01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:36.680
You see what the results are of that.

01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:39.980
You see the incentives that creates

01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:43.420
and the problems with Google centralizing all of that.

01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.620
You're fully aware of that.

01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:47.940
That's not a problem podcasting has.

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:51.060
And Boost and the Lightning Network

01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:55.700
offer, if they are successful, a potential default way

01:05:55.700 --> 01:06:02.060
to monetize podcasting that is creating the biggest

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:04.100
customer out of the audience.

01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:07.420
So the podcaster and the business from get-go,

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:12.340
from episode one, is 100% focused

01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.580
on super serving the audience because they're

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.460
the ones consuming the content.

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:19.220
And they're the ones paying for the content.

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:22.380
So the incentives for the creator are 100% aligned

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:23.900
with the incentives of the audience.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:27.060
Not an algorithm, not a multinational billion dollar

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:30.640
corporation, but with the audience.

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:35.220
And it's being done over a free software peer-to-peer payment

01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:41.460
network that anyone can run on a Raspberry Pi in their home.

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:45.940
It fundamentally is a land shift change for podcasting

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.500
if it's successful.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:51.740
And it could keep podcasting independent and free

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:53.660
for the next decade.

01:06:53.660 --> 01:06:57.700
It's huge because it allows us to maintain the public RSS

01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.300
format and the public directory format

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:03.260
and giving the podcast away for free.

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:07.380
But it avoids all of the evil incentives

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:09.940
that are created by a centralized platform

01:07:09.940 --> 01:07:13.460
to monetize and have an algorithm for discovery.

01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:16.420
It could create something truly beautiful

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:18.100
in independent media.

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.340
It probably couldn't come at a more important time

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:24.100
in human history when it comes to media, independent media,

01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:26.460
and what you can trust.

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:28.020
OK, now I'm truly done.

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:30.580
One perspective I keep coming to is like, Chris,

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.220
if you and I were to sit down and we didn't know about Bitcoin

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.380
and we didn't know about lightning

01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.820
and we didn't know about the value for value

01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.100
and the boosts and stuff like that.

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:38.540
And we sat down, we said, hey, we

01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:43.420
need a way for listeners to support the podcast network.

01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:45.360
What would we come up with?

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.780
And it would be something that is open source,

01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:50.300
that's decentralized.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.420
Built into the app.

01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:53.260
You could just push a button in the app.

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:56.900
Sure, sure, yeah, or even our new website, for instance.

01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:01.540
It would be something that has relatively low barrier

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:03.460
to entry.

01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:05.740
So yeah, you got to jump through a few technical hoops.

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:07.340
That's actually an advantage for us

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:14.260
because a few barriers to entry equals better content.

01:08:14.260 --> 01:08:16.940
We've seen that repeatedly on various platforms.

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:18.820
Mumble is a great example of that.

01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:21.860
Well, and if we don't have a technical early adopter

01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.340
audience, who does, right?

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.340
So some of us have got to.

01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:25.260
That is very fair.

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:27.940
Right, that's how we get this made is the early adopters.

01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:28.620
And that's us.

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:29.660
We're the early adopters.

01:08:29.660 --> 01:08:32.220
And we don't ask that everyone be an early adopter.

01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:34.300
But we're like, hey, if you want to run with scissors with us,

01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:36.940
come along, grab your scissors, let's go.

01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:38.140
It's fun.

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.660
So I keep thinking, what would we build differently?

01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:43.220
And I don't think I really have a great answer for that.

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.260
Yeah, because the payment system,

01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:48.020
the fact that people could send us a fraction of a penny

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.100
is remarkable.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.420
But there's the other aspect of the network effect here.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:56.060
So I was on the podcasting 2.0 show like episode 94,

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.720
Bells Out episode.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:59.980
And guess what happened?

01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:02.860
Several of our audience members boosted their episode

01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:05.260
because I was on there to say thanks for having Chris.

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:06.700
The opposite happened as well.

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:09.460
We got some new audience members from that.

01:09:09.460 --> 01:09:11.120
Exactly, and they boosted in.

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:15.380
And imagine what happens when the next Linux podcaster

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:17.420
decides to try this.

01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:19.340
They're going to immediately have boosts coming in.

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:21.500
And I know this because I'm on the Bitcoin Dad Pod,

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.500
and he's getting boosts from JBU audience members all the time.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.760
And imagine what happens when the next free software

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.860
developer or free software project,

01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:30.900
the next interview we do, or the next project

01:09:30.900 --> 01:09:33.540
we talk about where they've got a lightning node address,

01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:34.540
and we include them in our splits.

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:35.700
They're going to get boosts.

01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:37.620
They're going to get SATs.

01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:40.460
It just grows and grows and grows.

01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:44.180
To stop doing this because people don't like crypto

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.420
would be the equivalent of me stopping to talk about,

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:49.340
stop talking about free software and Linux 15 years ago

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:53.060
because people liked Windows and Apple's ecosystem.

01:09:53.060 --> 01:09:54.100
I agree.

01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:58.700
If I was on here shilling Ethereum or Solona,

01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:00.900
you know, Avalanche or whatever.

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:01.780
Doge.

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.340
Doge, yeah.

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.760
I think it'd be grotesque, and I think

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.060
you should stop listening.

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:10.260
I would not be mentally sane.

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:11.620
I just couldn't.

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:13.580
But that's not Bitcoin.

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:17.660
And I ask if you don't believe that to maybe trust

01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:20.340
that I've done the homework, that I've got 12 years

01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:23.340
of experience on this, and I've gone really

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:26.620
deep on a lot of this stuff.

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:30.540
And I've been doing it recently too, so it's super fresh.

01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:34.080
Conclusion is Bitcoin and the Lightning Network

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.340
are a net positive for both free software, for podcasting,

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:39.260
and for all of humanity.

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:45.340
And the other stuff, 98% of it, Monero and a few others

01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:48.580
accepted, are probably absolute complete total scams

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:51.040
in securities and should be completely cracked down

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.260
by the SEC.

01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:54.660
And I just personally feel that way.

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:56.020
And it's not a judgment call.

01:10:56.020 --> 01:10:57.340
If you like those things, good on you.

01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:00.220
You're probably going to make some money in the next,

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:02.600
I don't know, three to four years after the market comes

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:03.100
back.

01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:08.260
But in the meantime, just trust me that I truly

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:10.100
believe there's a differentiation there.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:13.060
And if I didn't, I wouldn't talk about it on the shows

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:14.100
like we have.

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.460
And the technology, the Lightning technology, I think,

01:11:17.460 --> 01:11:18.840
is super powerful.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:21.540
And I think we're going to see a lot of innovations there.

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:23.580
If you look at it just from a hiring standpoint,

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.980
there's a lot of cool jobs to build out the Lightning

01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:26.220
Network.

01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:28.720
There's a lot of applications being built on that right now.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.460
A lot of companies that are hiring to build on top of that.

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:34.380
And it's all free software, guys.

01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.620
So it's pretty cool stuff.

01:11:35.620 --> 01:11:36.740
All right.

01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:37.620
Let's move the F on.

01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:41.940
Speaking of boosts, let's do a little bit of boosting.

01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:45.980
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you,

01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:49.140
but what you can boost for your podcast.

01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:52.100
Like a clock, the Golden Dragon, not only

01:11:52.100 --> 01:11:54.820
making it to live shows, hanging out in the matrix,

01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:56.860
but boosting like a maniac.

01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:00.140
Talk about a community member who just,

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:02.380
before we launched the boosts, I don't

01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:03.940
think I knew the Golden Dragon's name.

01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:07.580
And now I feel like the Golden Dragon's a buddy of mine.

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:09.540
Like, I'd go over to the Wing Shop

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.180
and have a beer with the Golden Dragon.

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:15.260
And he boosted it with 2,222 sats, a row of ducks.

01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:18.860
I'm a duck, D-U-K, duck, loaded with talent.

01:12:18.860 --> 01:12:20.420
And he also has you in mind.

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.420
He says, I am coming in hot with this boost.

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:24.540
Coming in hot with the boost.

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.260
I love that one so much.

01:12:26.260 --> 01:12:26.940
I know.

01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:27.840
We've got to get some new ones.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.460
People got to send us in some new ones.

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:31.100
He says, last episode was a great show.

01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:33.140
One day I hope to be good enough of a dev

01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.580
to give back to the community.

01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:36.060
That has welcomed me with open arms.

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:37.460
Thanks for the advice and my journey.

01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:38.140
Brent.

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:41.060
Well, here's another piece of advice, I think.

01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:42.660
Our website is a great way to do that.

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:47.620
There's some, like, I hesitate to call them low skill tasks

01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:48.460
that we need done.

01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:51.500
But I have been tagging some stuff, like, hey,

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:55.260
this is a great first, like, beginner task.

01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:56.600
And I fit that mold.

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.060
I don't know what I'm doing when it

01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:59.420
comes to building a Hugo website.

01:12:59.420 --> 01:13:01.100
But some of these things are really straightforward,

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:03.680
like some content or just changing something simple

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.700
that can get your big toe wet.

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:07.820
So that would be an interesting place to get started.

01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:10.140
Yeah, I'd say do something low hanging

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:16.380
like that that gets you just familiar with using Git,

01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:18.080
gets you familiar with interacting

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:19.780
with a community that's working on something

01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:21.420
because that's a lot different than just working

01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:22.740
on something by yourself.

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:24.420
Don't even worry about the language.

01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:26.620
Don't even worry about the tech, necessarily.

01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.400
This is advice I give on Coda Radio, too.

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.260
It's like, just get in there and learn to work with people.

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:33.660
Learn to work with Git, maybe GitHub.

01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:38.500
That skill set, you can apply to any language to any project.

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.360
And it makes you immediately valuable to just

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.740
about any other project if you've

01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:44.500
got that stuff figured out.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.520
So that's my advice.

01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.520
I think one really nice thing about the website

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:49.020
is that clearly, the Golden Dragon's

01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:51.980
been listening for a long time.

01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:57.020
So you already have a lot of the context for this project.

01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:59.120
And you may not understand the technology that's

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.540
underlying the whole website.

01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:03.980
But because you have a deep understanding of the context,

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:07.500
you can really apply a lot of great feedback

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:08.780
to the whole process.

01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:11.220
And someone else can go implement the technical part.

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:12.780
At least that's how I'm doing it.

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:14.660
And maybe one day, that'll be you implementing

01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:17.700
the technical part as skills move forward, right?

01:14:17.700 --> 01:14:18.540
It's cool.

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:21.380
Trevdev boosted in with some LeetSats.

01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:26.700
Boost and value for value are the only web 3 concept I like.

01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:28.620
He says, the only thing I don't like about boost

01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:32.540
is that I cannot always get a reply like I can with an email.

01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:33.940
Thanks for choosing independence.

01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:35.940
Congratulations on the progress with the new site.

01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:37.860
The static site route is the best route.

01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:38.740
I agree.

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:42.060
Very happy to have a static site after years of WordPress.

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:43.440
Yeah, so it is tricky.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.940
There are definitely boosts that have come in where I'm like,

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.400
I would like to reply to that one.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:51.300
I've even thought about, well, actually, OK.

01:14:51.300 --> 01:14:54.040
I have actually occasionally, every now and then,

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:56.020
tracked folks down that are on Matrix.

01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:58.100
Because a lot of times, people will boost in

01:14:58.100 --> 01:14:59.780
with their Matrix username as well.

01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:00.900
It's like they use the same username.

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:03.620
So then I can find them on Matrix, and I can reply.

01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:05.580
So I actually have done that a couple of times.

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:09.740
I think I remember in Fountain, I

01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:11.820
think I remember a feature in Fountain where you may

01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:13.060
be able to do replies.

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:15.020
But I have not tried it.

01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:17.320
And I think it might be worth us investigating that.

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:18.980
I have done that once or twice as well.

01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:20.060
Thank you for reminding me.

01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:20.820
That is true.

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:24.860
But for the most part, I'd say for like 99% of them,

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:27.620
what I find to be beneficial is that I can't reply.

01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:30.140
I mean, just think about that from a processing standpoint.

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:32.460
We just mentioned that was the best.

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:35.780
And actually, we probably reply much more thoughtfully

01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:36.820
on the show anyways.

01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:37.660
That's true.

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:38.340
That's true.

01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:40.820
Then you've got to wait to hear it on the show, I suppose.

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:48.220
All right, so Dilan, or Dylon, boosted in with 9,999 sats,

01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:49.540
which I think is our top booster.

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:52.020
Because I'm a back home baller.

01:15:52.020 --> 01:15:54.300
If I want something, I just holler.

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:54.920
He says, thanks.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.220
Yeah, it can be pronounced Dylon.

01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:00.840
But Dilan, or really just Dilan, are acceptable.

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:03.460
When I was young, I had a friend whose parents were from Germany

01:16:03.460 --> 01:16:05.460
and they simply just could not pronounce my name.

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:07.580
So now I use it everywhere as my handle.

01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:09.500
Thanks again for the soundboard suggestion.

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:11.900
I had mentioned a couple of soundboards last episode.

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.980
I look forward to running with scissors.

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:15.720
So that's the other thing about the boost

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:19.920
and the whole podcasting 2.0 thing is for 14 years, kind of.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.880
I felt like we've been in our own little bubble,

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:25.280
just doing our own little thing, and not really part

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.940
of anything else much.

01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:28.740
We do have some Linux friends and stuff,

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:30.300
but I felt like it's been very isolated

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:33.220
overall when you look at the entire podcast market.

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:35.660
And then this podcasting 2.0 stuff,

01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:38.020
which includes the boosts and the namespace support

01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:40.420
and the new features we're all working on,

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:42.260
it's felt like a broader community.

01:16:42.260 --> 01:16:44.500
We're part of something bigger now.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.180
And for the first time, I felt like I'm

01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:49.300
working together with a bunch of peers

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:52.300
to make the medium that we all love better,

01:16:52.300 --> 01:16:54.420
to invest in the medium.

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:56.540
And it's never felt better.

01:16:56.540 --> 01:17:00.340
That has felt like I didn't realize I was missing it.

01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:01.260
You know what I mean?

01:17:01.260 --> 01:17:03.300
Yeah, I would imagine for you as an early adopter

01:17:03.300 --> 01:17:07.500
of podcasting itself, this is like next level involvement

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.960
and pretty darn exciting.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:12.700
It was fun to be on the podcasting 2.0 show as well.

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:19.180
One last boost came in from Rose Deer, 3,333 sets.

01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:20.300
Boost!

01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:23.780
On the topic of new RSS feeds for the shows,

01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:27.860
I'd be interested in an edited version of LUP,

01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:30.620
so Drew's edited version of the main show,

01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:33.780
with an unedited free and post show.

01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:35.060
That's a monstrosity.

01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:37.180
I know Wes and I were talking about this

01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:38.640
after the last Office Hours, because I

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.180
think it might have been Optimus Gray or somebody that

01:17:40.180 --> 01:17:42.900
boosted in and said, I'd like a different arrangement.

01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:44.700
And I thought, how wild would it be

01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:47.540
if we could just take the different chapters

01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:50.780
in our podcasts and release them as individual modules?

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:53.340
And then you could go to a website dashboard

01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:55.980
and assemble the custom module feed that you wanted

01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:58.020
and generate your own one-off feed, right?

01:17:58.020 --> 01:17:58.980
That is so great.

01:17:58.980 --> 01:18:02.020
You got to put a ticket in our website and make it happen.

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:04.460
That is a really fabulous idea.

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:08.980
We got to get to the generating our own RSS feeds part first.

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:09.660
We'll get there.

01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:10.540
We'll get there.

01:18:10.540 --> 01:18:13.580
But it feels like a little bit like spins

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:14.780
of some of the distributions.

01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:17.100
You know, you put your own LEGO pieces together.

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:18.260
I love this idea.

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.340
I think it sounds technically very challenging,

01:18:20.340 --> 01:18:22.780
but it sounds really fun as a user.

01:18:22.780 --> 01:18:24.820
You'd want something on the back end

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:27.100
that could read the chapters of the MP3 file

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:29.860
and cut it up and then deliver it.

01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:31.820
It sounds like the technology is there, though.

01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:33.620
It's just about putting it together.

01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:34.660
Yeah, I imagine, right?

01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:36.980
You'd want to include the ads, because otherwise, people

01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:38.260
would just cut out all the ads all the time.

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:40.020
But what if they're a member?

01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:40.940
Yeah, right.

01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:41.700
That's the thing.

01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:43.480
If they're a member, then they should get the ability

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:44.780
not to include them, right?

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:45.980
But your ads are so great, sometimes

01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:46.820
you just want to hear them.

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:48.140
You know, you say that, but we actually

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.380
have gotten feedback from the members.

01:18:49.380 --> 01:18:50.860
They're like, I actually don't mind the ads.

01:18:50.860 --> 01:18:51.940
I just want to support you.

01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:54.780
And so some of them might actually choose to include them.

01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:56.260
We have a member's ad feed as well.

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:03.260
So, Rose Deer, I have no idea exactly what we're going to do.

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.060
But as we build out this new infrastructure,

01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:08.100
I'm starting to see new possibilities.

01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.420
I imagine Wes listening right now going, oh, god.

01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:11.820
Yeah, Wes just commented on it.

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:13.740
I could see him commenting in real time.

01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:14.540
It's pretty funny.

01:19:14.540 --> 01:19:16.140
He's like, shut up, shut up.

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:19.340
Just don't say anything.

01:19:19.340 --> 01:19:22.340
We got some thank you boosts, 100 sats from Marcel.

01:19:22.340 --> 01:19:25.700
He says, plus one for the only bonus stuff feed idea.

01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:27.140
That was the one we got last week,

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:29.100
was just the bonus stuff feed.

01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:32.280
And then, oh, this is actually our top baller.

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:33.340
I apologize.

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:34.780
I didn't realize this.

01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:36.780
10,000 sats from Silver Snake.

01:19:36.780 --> 01:19:38.220
No message, just a thank you.

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:42.500
Because I'm a back home baller in pajamas that cost $10.

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:45.060
Tell my mother that I love her more than any freaking other.

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:48.500
That's the life of a back home baller.

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.020
So thank you, Silver Snake.

01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:53.780
You are a back home baller in our neck of the woods.

01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:55.620
If you'd like to send a boost into the show,

01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:58.820
go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:00.500
I love Fountain FM and Podverse.

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:01.960
Those are fantastic.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:04.620
If you're on iOS and you're just jonesing for CarPlay,

01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:07.300
Cast-O-Matic is definitely worth a look.

01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:10.380
And if you don't want to switch apps, you'll like your app.

01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:14.220
Well, then go get Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z dot technology,

01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:16.580
or boost us in with Boost CLI.

01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:18.660
I think it's been weeks since anybody

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:20.060
has boosted with Boost CLI.

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:20.940
It's true.

01:20:20.940 --> 01:20:24.060
I guess the command line is just, it's too hard for people.

01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:24.780
Well, we'll see.

01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:25.360
It's too hard.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:25.860
We'll see.

01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:26.900
We'll see.

01:20:26.900 --> 01:20:33.300
And 50% of all of those boosts go to Brent Gas Tank Fund

01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:35.420
to get them out here to the studio in a few weeks.

01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:37.220
So thank you, everybody.

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:38.820
We appreciate that.

01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:40.980
And that was also a fun experiment

01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:43.380
in Brent running his own node.

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:45.540
We should have you dive in and do like a record.

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:46.420
Yeah, we should give an update.

01:20:46.420 --> 01:20:47.340
A retrospective.

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:47.940
You're right.

01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:49.380
Maybe on the next Office Hours.

01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:49.940
Maybe.

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:50.460
Maybe.

01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:52.220
In the meantime, we'll have links

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:55.220
to the stuff we talked about over at officehours.hares

01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:56.660
slash 9.

01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:58.860
You can also subscribe to our RSS feed over there,

01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:00.700
because we've got a ton of stuff coming up.

01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:02.820
Besides the website, we've got a road trip project.

01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:05.120
And then after that, I mean, there's a lot.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.700
But one of the things on my radar

01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:08.060
that I know we're going to organize here

01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:09.460
on the show with the community is

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:11.900
I want to take the taxis to the next level.

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:15.100
And I think this is going to be where we plant our flag

01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:16.180
and organize that.

01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:18.940
So that way we can come to Linux unplugged with great results.

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:19.900
You know what I mean?

01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:21.980
So that'll be coming up way in the future,

01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:23.460
because we've got website stuff still.

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:24.380
We got road trip stuff.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:26.900
But we got, I mean, there's just a lot going on still.

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:28.740
So go to officehours.hares slash subscribe.

01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:30.820
So that way you're on the inside loop of everything

01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:32.860
that's going on over at Jupiter Broadcasting.

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:34.420
And of course, we got our contact page

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:38.180
over there where you can send us in your contacts for free.

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:41.300
And you know, maybe we'll talk about it in a future episode.

01:21:41.300 --> 01:21:43.660
In the meantime, Office Hours are over.

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:44.860
It's mine again.

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:45.580
Go on.

01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:46.540
Get out of here.

01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:49.380
And please, take your garbage with you, would you?

01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:51.180
I'm not your dad.

01:21:51.180 --> 01:22:15.660
See you next time.
