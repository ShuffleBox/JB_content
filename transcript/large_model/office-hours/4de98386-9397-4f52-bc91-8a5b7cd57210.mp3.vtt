WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
So, is it Stefan or Stephon?

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Because I keep realizing I'm saying it both ways.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.000
No, Stefan is fine.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
That's my fault. French Canadian coming out.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
Oh, it is absolutely Brent's fault.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Sorry.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
No, it's just 100% your fault.

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
We already discussed this in the LUTpo show.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
I'm fine with it.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Brent.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
I know. I'm trying my best.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
But, you know, language equals heart.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Jeremy, yeah, I know.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
I know for sure.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
You understand, right?

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Brent gets drunk.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
He starts talking in French.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
It's the tea that gets to me.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
The tea.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
It's Office Hours.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
With me, Chris.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Brent's here too.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Welcome in, everybody.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Hello.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I'm here.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
You know, I put out a candle.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I lit it a good hour before we got in here.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
That way people think it smells good all the time.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
What's that flavor?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
I can't quite pinpoint it.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
It's bacon.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
Oh, yeah, right.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
The sizzling was missing, so I couldn't quite pinpoint that.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
I got it from a place called Mandles.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Not far from the studio.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Real place.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Really sells stuff like that.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
We got a special show today.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
This episode of Office Hours.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I'm glad you're joining us.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.000
To make things extra special,

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
the star of the show,

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
the man, the legend,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
the community leader,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
our website hero,

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Mr. Stefan is back.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Hello, Stefan.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
Welcome into the office.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
Hi. Thanks for having me.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Thank you for being here.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
You know I mean it when I say it.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
First of all, you've been doing a hero's amount of work

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
to see the work in progress.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
But you've also inspired

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
a lot of community members

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
to get in and start working

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
and just cranking through

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
all this stuff.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
We really are seeing something come together

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
that I think is pretty special.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
I thank you for that too.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I think you led the way on that

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
and people followed your lead.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Thank you for that too.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I'm not sure if I can claim that on me.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
I'm happy for the community.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
The community is great

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
and pretty smart.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
They know what they're doing

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
and they're coming up with stuff

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
where I really need

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
a second to process what's happening

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
and so on.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
There are a lot of talented people

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
in the community.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
But also,

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
Kiro is also doing

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
tons of work.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Without him,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I would be so far behind.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
So he's doing a lot of the...

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
He did all the content

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
parsing and so on so that we

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
have the content we can work with.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
He's like

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
super consistent and super helpful

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
and it's really been

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
a pleasure working with him also.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
Brent, it's been pretty great watching

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
the GitHub stats and

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
everything come together. We've had some big

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
development since our last Office Hours.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Yeah, I was a little astounded because

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
a few days ago I pulled some of those

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
stats and put them in our little

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
show doc for this show. And this morning

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I had to update it because it had almost doubled.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
So in the last 30 days or so

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
there's like 13 authors who have published

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
112 commits.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Yeah.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
Stefan's like, oh man, I just spend all my time looking at

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
pull requests and stuff these days

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
instead of actually building

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
things, which is sort of an interesting problem.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
It's an interesting problem to

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
have. It's also like

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
a bit of a

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
challenge for me to do it this way

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
because, and this is

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
also something we realized, so we

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
went from my MVP

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
project side

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
to the official

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Jupyter Broadcasting repository.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
And that

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
like brought a lot of attention

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
to the whole

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
project. And

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
yeah, then we realized, I mean before

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
it was just Brent,

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Kiro and myself working on

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
that. And we had like

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
a good report and everybody

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
had his own little part

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
of the project. So Kiro

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
was all the scraping,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Brent a lot was the content and me

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
was the site and the build process itself

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
and so on. And now you have

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
like input everywhere and every

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
process and people chiming in

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
and then you need

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
to make sure that the

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
vision is like

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
upholded, but the vision

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
never was clearly defined.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
And I think that was like

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
yeah, I underestimated

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
what we

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
what would change if we make it public

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
so soon and that

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
you need to put out like a lot of information

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
what you want to achieve and

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
what is important for you and

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
how people can best contribute

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
because otherwise it's a frustrating

05:02.000 --> 05:04.000
experience for everybody

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
who wants to contribute and then

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I don't have the time to explain something

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
or they're working on something

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I completely didn't intend

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
because I was unspecific

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
and so on. And so my role

05:16.000 --> 05:18.000
changed like a lot

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
or is changing. Yeah, it's really

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
interesting. This is the very first time I

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
well, two things a

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
contribute so deeply to like

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
an open source spirit project, which

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
has been a ton of fun.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
But be of course

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
also am one of the people

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
who are trying to organize all of this work.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
So I'm learning a ton and

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
one of the things now that I'm

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
spending most of my time on before it was

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
writing content and stuff like that.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
But now it's just trying to organize things

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
and to

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
we have been using

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
the GitHub issues as tickets for

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
features and ideas and like

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
asking questions and things like that.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
And previously

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
just like two or three weeks

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
ago, we were just listing those things

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
and the small

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
tiny group of people who are working on the project

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
understood all of the assumptions.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
So, you know, a ticket idea might

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
just be make

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
community page and there was no other

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
information. And so we quickly realized

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
that's not helpful

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
to a group of 10 plus, you know,

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
13 plus people who are working on stuff.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
So I've it's been interesting

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
that I've had to be

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
much more intentional about

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
what we're trying to achieve on

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
each ticket and define

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
ideas to look at or

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
ask for ideas or even just

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
like here's the vision

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
and that's been actually super helpful to

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
define what the end goal

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
is. It's been really fascinating

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
actually to work with so many people

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
and it's been great. And the suggestions on

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
how to solve certain problems have been equally

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
great. Equally great. So thank you to everyone.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
And also, Brent, I must say I

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
think you're doing a stellar job.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Thanks. I would not have

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
guessed that this is like your first time

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
doing something like that. And it's really

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
helping me out. I mean, maybe

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
you don't feel that way

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
or I don't know, but it's

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
really appreciated and it helps out

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
because that's

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
like you

07:14.000 --> 07:16.000
help out in areas where I'm not

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
so good. So

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
it's really good.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
So you don't mind the giant list of

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
assigned tickets I give you in the morning.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
I wouldn't go that far, but

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
I manage. Yeah.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
So yeah, you

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
are managing. It's been great. But you are right

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
when we opened it up to the public, we got

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
we got we get people that are working

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
on stuff by the time I go to sleep and by the time I wake

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
up, something's been created.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
And so we've been feeling like

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
it's probably time to focus

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
because what I realized

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
and I think Brent probably realized pretty recently

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
too, is with this road

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
trip we have coming up in September,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
we really have a hard deadline

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
of getting this done in August.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
And that means we really probably have

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
to kind of focus on very specific things

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
to get that done. And I

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
feel like I'm

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
only really starting to wrap my head around it now because

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
well, it's part of

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
the squeaky wheel problem also, but we've been

08:12.000 --> 08:14.000
really asking ourselves what role does the

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
website serve and what

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
will it serve in the future as we kind of start

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
our migration process away from fireside

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
and we migrate to more

08:22.000 --> 08:24.000
of building our own back end infrastructure

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
and that has

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
sort of meant that there's

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
been times where I've felt like, well, okay, we should

08:30.000 --> 08:32.000
do things like generate the RSS feeds from the website

08:32.000 --> 08:34.000
and then there's a time later I'm like, actually, no,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
now that I think about it, that's not going to work. We can't

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
do that. And so I've been looking at what

08:38.000 --> 08:40.000
do we still have ahead of us and what can we trim?

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
And I'm curious if either

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
one of you have thoughts on areas

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
that we should probably look at just

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
focusing in on just for the next

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
few weeks so that way we can make the

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
flip over without

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
losing track of two that we could probably use some

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
more help with design too. But

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
curious on your thoughts on that.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Yeah, it's true. So

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
I had a bit of a

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
not a breakdown, but I was

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
getting a bit nervous and I was

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
contacting Brent

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
on Sunday and I was like, we can

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
continue like this. And I realized

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
that was maybe a bit more dramatic

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
than I intended, but

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
I just wanted to say that

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
exactly what Chris said

09:20.000 --> 09:22.000
that we need to focus on what

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
we can really achieve in the next three to

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
four weeks because it's not more

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
and be realistic about it. So

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I was down with COVID for a week,

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
which was not fun and

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
impacted my productivity.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
And

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
so we really need to

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
be realistic and also

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
be honest in

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
we won't stop when

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
we release.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
I mean, we just continue. We just

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
need to know what we need to have

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
to start the transition

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
and then work on it. And we're calling

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
it milestone one. And I think

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
we will in this week

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
clean up the tickets a bit

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
and really assign tickets

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
that will go into milestone one,

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
which we really need for production

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
and then make a milestone two.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
And that's like four weeks after

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
going live what we want to

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
add feature wise next.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And yeah, we really need to hunker down

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
on on milestone one and get that done.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Yeah, it's the

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
final crunch is approaching. And

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
so now it's like, OK, what do we have to have to

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
just get this thing, you know, to launch off

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
the ground? Because scale

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
engine has very

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
politely been reminding us

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
that their deadline is serious and that they

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
are out of the WordPress hosting business and they'd

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
really like us gone by the end of summer. So

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
we got to do it.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
And I understand. And we do have a

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
few details to figure out on

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
like back end hosting stuff and whatnot.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
But we have a lot of options.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
So in some ways it feels like that's in

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
not that it's unimportant, but it's

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
not a critical decision,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
whereas like

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
what do we work on? What do we pass

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
for now? That feels a little

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
more critical. And there may be things that

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
you know,

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
we could, like you said, we just don't need

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
in in version one or phase

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
one or milestone one.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
And so that includes like the whole

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
process. So I am

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
this multi site workflow

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
I already created so

11:18.000 --> 11:20.000
that we can

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
in the future not use

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
fireside anymore, but using

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
to build everything that can

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
take a bit of a backseat

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
because that's not needed to like right away.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
We don't need to replace the fireside sites.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
And so that's

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
like a lot of work

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
that can be done later.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
But and I feel like

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
we are

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
feature wise, we are like

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
there. So we could

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
easily, I think

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
switch over because like the

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
episodes are there. You can use

11:52.000 --> 11:54.000
the video player, the audio players

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
and also thanks

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
to Keyroad who implemented the

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
Podverse player, right?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Yeah. Also a special shout

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
out that Mitch from the Podverse project has

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
joined and that has been great too to see.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
And they figured that

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
out by themselves. So I

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
had like zero input.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Keyroad needed to explain some stuff to me.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
So yeah, and

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
it was really, yeah

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
all his work and

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
yeah, that's working good now.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
That's a great example. People have swooped in and really

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
helped out. You're right. We are really close.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
I have like a couple of controversial hot takes

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
just in design wise. Like I actually

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
don't, I don't really want the video

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
player on the episode pages. The reason

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
why we have a video player on the existing

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
JB site is a limitation

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
in the WordPress theme. And if

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
we don't put something there, the page doesn't

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
render properly. So we've just been embedding the

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
video. But we don't really need it. And that

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
Podverse player is so great. That could be front and

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
center or right around that area.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
But yeah, that kind of stuff. There's a few other notes, but all

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
small stuff. I think you're right. We're close

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
and we could always iterate on the design too

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
once it's done. And so I'm

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
really pleased with like the build times.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
So every time you commit something

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
the site gets built and then deployed.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
It sure does. It's incredible.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
So I mean, it's generating like

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
21,000 sites

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
and deploys it in like

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
under two minutes.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
That's insane. And that's

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
like GitHub free tier runners

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
and so on. So that's nothing fancy.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
And I think try doing that

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
with Jacket or something like that and

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
will be like probably

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
25 minutes

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
or 30 minutes. I mean, it sounds

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
so not important,

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
but if you do a lot of changes

13:34.000 --> 13:36.000
and do a lot of deployments, you want

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
to make it fast and also

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
like locally when you do stuff

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
you want it to be fast.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
And so I really

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000
like that. Yes, the chat room is

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
asking, Dan's asking in our Matrix

13:48.000 --> 13:50.000
live chat. Yes, we're using Hugo

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
to generate the site. It just

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
it sort of worked out to be the perfect tool

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
for the job. I had had it in the back of my mind

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
for years as a possible

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
replacement. But you know, it gives us something

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
to work with. It's tooling that people can understand

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
and then the output is just a really

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
nice, flat, fast website,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
you know, and which is sort of what I feel

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
it's the opposite of what WordPress gives you

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
in a lot of ways. So I also did like a lot

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
of WordPress sites in the past, but not

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
like for the last eight years

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
or so because I just couldn't

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
stand it anymore. And

14:20.000 --> 14:22.000
so I really like Hugo because

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
you doesn't

14:24.000 --> 14:26.000
need maintenance. It's like

14:26.000 --> 14:28.000
super fast. You can't get any faster

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
and it's like

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
it doesn't need fancy hosting.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
Has it been much of a barrier for people

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
coming in to work on the project? Have you noticed that

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
or are people picking it up pretty easily?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
All at the same time. I was new to Hugo,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
new to GitHub,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
new to Git itself

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
and kind of new

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
to setting up a development environment locally

14:48.000 --> 14:50.000
as well. But even with

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
just the very super

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
minimal documentation that you had up

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
on the MVP site a while ago

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
and it's pretty straightforward to get in there.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.000
Now I did get like an exclusive

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
tour of how Hugo works thanks

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
to Stefan and we spent like, I don't know,

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
three hours or something hanging out doing

15:06.000 --> 15:08.000
that. But I have found

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
that the structure is fairly simple and

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
as long as you understand a

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
few little principles, most

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
of it is fairly readable. And so

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
you know making

15:18.000 --> 15:20.000
modifications, especially to content

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
has been very straightforward

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
and that was the whole point was to make it sort

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
of very markdown friendly,

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
easy for hosts to go in there

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
and change information and

15:30.000 --> 15:32.000
make a few little tweaks. So I found that

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
quite nice. Now

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
I can't speak to the backend

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
stuff and what's happening there.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
Other people have dove in and it seems

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
fairly friendly.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
What interests me is like do you prefer it

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
compared to like

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
a WordPress backend, like

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
a web front end? Do you like

15:50.000 --> 15:52.000
the workflow of just using your text editor

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
and doing stuff? I mean I love it

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
because that's how I do, you know,

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
my own personal notes. That's how I record

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
things in my own knowledge base. I've just

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
got a bunch

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
text notes in Nextcloud

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
or whatever. And I would say

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
we have a dream.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
We have a dream talk.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
The show doc

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
is the source of truth one day and

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
we put everything in the show doc, guest

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
information, links, everything, show

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
description and we maybe have certain

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
specific

16:22.000 --> 16:24.000
things we put in there to make it clear to anything

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
reading the doc that this is host, this is guest,

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
these are links. We accommodate

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
that and then you basically feed

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
that to whatever is generating the

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
website and then goes and generates all

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
the feeds and generates all of the posts

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
on YouTube and everywhere else.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
One day. That's really the dream

16:40.000 --> 16:42.000
and so our workflow

16:42.000 --> 16:44.000
would technically be text, although we

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
use Hdocs, which is a markdown

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
real time editor in the web,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
but it's just stored as text

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
in the database that we would probably

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
be pulling and then using

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
one day. We're not there.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
Cairo again did something in this regard

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
because he built this content

17:00.000 --> 17:02.000
scraper and it's running now once a

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
day and looks for new episodes

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
and then automatically adds it to

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
the current site. So that's basically

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
that.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
It's really neat.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
I'm

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
super happy how it turned out, but

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
I'm also like, I like that

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
we are using plain Hugo

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
without any Node.js tooling and so on.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
There was a bit of a discussion

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
in the community. We should use Node.js

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
and so on and so on and more JavaScript

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
and I am a bit

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
reluctant to adding that. So my

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
idea is keep it as simple

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
as possible. I really like

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
that you just need Hugo as a binary

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
to do everything. Also like

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
the stylesheet compilation and

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
all that stuff is done by Hugo and

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
you don't need the whole Node.js

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
setup and so on because setting up Node.js

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
can really be annoying, especially

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
if you are not

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
experienced in that. So it

17:54.000 --> 17:56.000
can be rather painful.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
So we have like in the community

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
people from all kinds

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
of backgrounds and I want to

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
make it as easy as possible and

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
saying to them, you just need the

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
Hugo binary and that's it.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Makes it like super

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
easy to enter.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
Approachable, but also we were talking about

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
this with Wes behind the scenes because

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
we like to make sure that Wes has

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
his input on any of the tech decisions

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
we are making and for us the

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
advantage of it just being the Hugo binary

18:24.000 --> 18:26.000
keeping it really simple and not making any Node

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
dependencies is it makes

18:28.000 --> 18:30.000
our deployment and server

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
strategy super portable

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
where we A. can

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
shop around if we ever need to.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Don't know, we might not need to, but it's nice to have that

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
ability. But B. it makes it

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
just a simpler maintenance thing for us long term,

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
right? And so that to us

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
is extremely valuable,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
especially considering a lot of the fancier

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
stuff we could do outside the

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
website and then just put the results on the website.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
I'm not necessarily a

18:54.000 --> 18:56.000
100% opposed to doing

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
something that adds a lot of value,

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
but I totally am agreement

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
with you, Stefan. It's like we keep it simple,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
keep it down to the binary. We keep it portable. We

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
keep it approachable by new developers and

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
we make it easier for JB to maintain.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.000
I mean, 10 years

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
we've had the current website 10, 11

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
years in different iterations.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
So that's the kind of timeline

19:16.000 --> 19:18.000
we could be looking at here.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
And I mean, you always

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
should consider when you're introducing

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
complexity that the value is there.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.000
That's not just complexity for complexity

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
sake or for like superficial

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
benefits.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
And all of this is open source,

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
right? So if we keep it simple

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
and we keep it understandable, it's possible

19:36.000 --> 19:38.000
another podcast group could take

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
this work and they could deploy something that meets

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
their needs. And the simpler we keep it,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.000
the more likely that is to happen too.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.000
There's that element. It's not like totally

19:46.000 --> 19:48.000
driving every decision, but it's

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
as we do some of this stuff, it's in the back of my mind.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Yeah. And also that's why I chose

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
like we have the CSS framework

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
called Bulma. I chose

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
it because it's like super simple.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
It is only CSS and HTML

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
components

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
and has no like JavaScript and

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
anything doesn't make any assumptions

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
what you want to use it for.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
And it's just very

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
extensible and very good documented.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
And it's also like serving

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
us well, I guess, because the community,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
the people who didn't know Bulma

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
kind of start to liking

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
it. And yeah,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
it's a good framework how

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
we can introduce new components and

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
so on. So that's not like super chaos

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
and yeah, better

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
to style. Yeah. So

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I think that's also good.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
And also like, yeah, on the design front,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
we have like a lot of stuff still

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
to do and clean it up and

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
so on because that's like

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
the least important part or the

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
parts that has not many

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
unknowns. So it's not like a risky

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
part. You just need to some hours

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
sit yourself there and

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
clean it up. The design can be extra

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
tricky too, because like that is

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
something that is, you know,

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
it's touching on the brand identity a bit too.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
So it's like we probably want to loop in some JB

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
people on that and that could take time,

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
but we do need the help with the design.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
It's all up on our GitHub and we do have

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
the matrix chat room as well where people can

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
collaborate. Reese has recently been jumping in looking

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
at some of that stuff. There's been some folks

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
there, but Brent, you have probably a better read on it than I do,

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
but it feels like that's still an area where maybe

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
we could use some additional help

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
as design. And if you go to

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
jupitabroadcasting.net and take a look at it, you probably

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
see some areas that could use some sprucing. Yeah,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
I mean, the episode page itself

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
definitely needs some love.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
So it's just like the

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
bare content just here

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
it is. I mean, we're

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
not winning any awards with that.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
You know, this is

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
version one. I have

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
I've been trying to be pretty diligent

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
about putting design

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
tags on some of the issues that touch

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
on design stuff. And I did just

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
this morning write some pretty

21:52.000 --> 21:54.000
clear, maybe guiding

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
tips for

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
what we need those pages to be

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
some thoughts on just like

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
hey, this could move here. This could move here

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
like very clear for

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
some of the conversations Chris, you

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
and I and Wes had recently

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
about that. I've also

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
tagged them as like good

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
first issue because I think someone who has some

22:14.000 --> 22:16.000
design background

22:16.000 --> 22:18.000
Hugo makes it

22:18.000 --> 22:20.000
pretty approachable to kind of work on some of that

22:20.000 --> 22:22.000
stuff. And we've gotten a few people from

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
websites like firstgoodissue.com

22:24.000 --> 22:26.000
and stuff like that that have come in

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
and had a look and some community members

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
who've kind of bitten on those

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
strategies of mine and it's working. So

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
I think we're getting there. We could use a little bit

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
more help, I think. But there's certainly

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
an issue that we can link to that

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
clearly states

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
at least five things that I

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
think need to happen right away as a priority.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
We can throw that in the notes.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Yeah. Also, I think

22:48.000 --> 22:50.000
design or web design

22:50.000 --> 22:52.000
doesn't scale well with different

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
or with multiple users. So there's

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
like you need to have like a clear

22:56.000 --> 22:58.000
vision and like two, three

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
people really coming up with how they wanted

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
to look and then other people

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
to execute. But I think

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
the design itself

23:06.000 --> 23:08.000
doesn't scale well as like a development

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
process of code or so.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
That's like a bit tricky.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
And I mean, it's like your brand

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
and you must

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
like decide what

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
you want, right?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.000
So you must be happy

23:22.000 --> 23:24.000
with it.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
That's a really good point. Thankfully, you know,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
I think as a photographer and working with a lot of designers,

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
maybe I'm well suited to at least

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
be a guiding light on that. I can't

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
do the implementations, but

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
certainly I can provide a little bit of guidance.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
So I'll keep doing that for sure.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
But we have really good people for

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
implementation.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Okay, I see what you're saying.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.000
You're saying get to it.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
Yeah, all right. I love it here.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
They just need to be

23:50.000 --> 23:52.000
told or explained

23:52.000 --> 23:54.000
what to do and then they

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
can do it. I have

23:56.000 --> 23:58.000
no doubt. Yeah, that touches on something I've been

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
impressed by actually in the last

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
even two weeks. It's like every time I come up

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
with an idea because I'm trying to use

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
the jupyterbroadcasting.net

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
site as my main

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
resource whenever I'm working

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
on our show episodes and stuff like

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
that so that I can see, you know,

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
how does it fit into my usual everyday

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
workflow? And then it

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
becomes quickly obvious like, oh, wait a second.

24:20.000 --> 24:22.000
Like I don't want tags first. I want a description

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
or hey, there's some hosts missing

24:24.000 --> 24:26.000
or something like that. So it's been a great way

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
to just kind of test the site and

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
see some of the features that

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
I kind of wish were there and some functionality

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
that we currently have on the current website

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
that's maybe missing. So that's been great.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
But I've been impressed

24:38.000 --> 24:40.000
mostly by how I can just like,

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
you know, of course, late at night

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
dream up features that

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
I wish were there like, oh, I'm going to make a ticket

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
for this thing. That would be nice. Oh, I'm going to

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
make another ticket for this other thing that like

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
I don't know if we could do that, but that would be nice.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.000
And it's amazing. Like sometimes then

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
I'll, you know, do an eight hours of

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
sleep and wake up and someone's already done it.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
And it's insane.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.000
A huge thank you

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
to everybody who's just like picked up

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
some of these random ideas and made them happen in a

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
short amount of time. It's been really impressive. So

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
I think, yeah, I

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
can't say enough good things about that.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
And it also seems like everybody

25:16.000 --> 25:18.000
is like having a good time, having fun,

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
which is also, I think, always important

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
if you work on something

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
in your free time, it

25:24.000 --> 25:26.000
should be enjoyable and

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
the people should be nice and they

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
should be good to each other, which they all

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
are because it's like a stellar community.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
And yeah,

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
it's really, it's

25:36.000 --> 25:38.000
work, but it's also like fun.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I've caught Kiro

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
mentioning in our matrix chat a few

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
times that he's like, oh geez,

25:44.000 --> 25:46.000
I wish I didn't have this day job so I could just keep

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
working on this project.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
The best community, really.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
And it's such a great demonstration

25:52.000 --> 25:54.000
of the value for value stuff that we've been talking

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
about, right? It's not a monetary thing.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
But it's so immensely valuable

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
and the website has needed

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
this for so long.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Right?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
Are you now like a bit like

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
why didn't we do this sooner?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.000
Perhaps. Yeah, I mean, maybe.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
It was, you know,

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
there's always so many things to be working on.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
Not every time we've opened something up

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
to the community has it gone super well because

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
you know what I think, you noticed

26:20.000 --> 26:22.000
when we went public

26:22.000 --> 26:24.000
with it, how a lot of things changed.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.000
That's generally how we have started a lot of

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
projects in the past is we just boom,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
start from the very beginning like that and it just kind of goes in a hundred

26:30.000 --> 26:32.000
different directions.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.000
So I think, you know, this time it

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
had a little bit different of a trajectory

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
because we kind of started

26:38.000 --> 26:40.000
it low key and

26:40.000 --> 26:42.000
then we started talking about it on office hours

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
and that's really kind of like,

26:44.000 --> 26:46.000
you know, the core JB audience.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000
It's like the JB completionists

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
that are listening to all the shows are catching office hours.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
So it's a smaller group. And then when

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
we put it on the GitHub and, you know,

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
started the matrix room, it just sort of

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
blew up from there. But having that kind of

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
staged growth, I think helped

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
us get a few key individuals like yourself

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000
in and get a few things established

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
before it just went totally

27:06.000 --> 27:08.000
haywire. That was the missing recipe

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
I think that made it actually get traction

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
this time. Also,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
I really think having GitHub involved makes

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
a big difference. Like we've really debated this in the past.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
Should we use our own GitLab?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Should we use something else? Or should we go

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
on GitHub? And I think it made a difference

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
this time organizing this on GitHub.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
I think that also helped.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
Because everybody

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
who works now on the JB

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
site now gets like

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
progression on GitHub and

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
represents and so on.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
I mean, I'm always like happy when I

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
see the green dots every day and I think

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
yeah, I've done something good

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
and everybody sees it.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
That's nice.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
We're passing around screenshots

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
internally of it, you know, watching it.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
So everybody's watching it. It's great.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
I think that's been a factor.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
And it feels great to actually have

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
this accomplished now because we had to pull

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
it off now. I don't know what we were going to do.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
Maybe I was just going to throw together some really crappy Hugo

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
site that would have been really bad. I don't know what

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
I would have done. So, pretty

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
great. Like I say, it's been

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
extremely valuable for us and we're just really grateful.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
We've got 13 people now working

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
on that. That's not nothing.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Well, and in the matrix room as well, there

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
are more than 30 people discussing

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
ideas and stuff like that.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
And some people joining every single day.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
So I think it's

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
trending in kind of an amazing direction.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
It's great. I don't know at which

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
point I'll be overwhelmed, but I'll let you guys know.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
I need

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
help. I need help. You can't be overwhelmed,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Brent.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
What will I do then?

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
You know, I need you

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
for being overwhelmed.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
So.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
That's right. Well, you can.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
He can. He just can't be overwhelmed at the same

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
time, right? You guys have to alternate.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
Yeah. Okay. That's true.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
You'll be overwhelmed at my nighttime. I'll be

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
overwhelmed at your nighttime.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
That's also a deal.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
And every project needs one sane

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
person. And that's you.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
You're the dedicated sane person on this

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
project. So. Deal.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
Do I get a badge? Maybe.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
That would be great. We should come up with some swag.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
That would be really nice for the people involved

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
with the website. We'll circle back to that idea.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Well, okay. So we should

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
say if you'd like to participate, if you're listening

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
and want to get involved, we'll have links

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
in the show notes to the GitHub page.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
There's also the J.B.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
website matrix group where sort of the on the ground

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
chat is happening. Is there anything

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
else we should point people to that are

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
hearing and kind of getting curious, maybe want to participate?

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
I think we did set up recently

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
a contributing

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
.md, a little bit

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
of documentation there. It's

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
a bunch of ideas collected. But if you're

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
new to the project and you're

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
thinking, oh, how is the best way

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
for me to approach getting

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
involved? We've tried to describe

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
it there. So that's a good place to start.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
Read that. It's not too long. If you have any questions,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
please just ask me directly or ask

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
anywhere in a ticket or something and we're

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
happy to help. But that

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
is probably the best approach.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
There you go. Stefan, thank you for joining us.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
We really appreciate you being here and

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
all your hard work, obviously. Thank you.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.000
I'm going to take a moment and I'm going to thank Linode for

30:12.000 --> 30:14.000
sponsoring Office Hours. They are

30:14.000 --> 30:16.000
crazy enough to actually support the

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
shenanigans, if you can believe it.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
So let's go right now and say hello to Linode

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
together. Let's do it together. Linode.com

30:22.000 --> 30:24.000
and guess what?

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
I got slash Jupiter. You did.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.000
You got the whole planet? I got the

30:28.000 --> 30:30.000
it's a big planet too, Brent. It sure is.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.000
Yeah, it's true.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
You guys know this, but I'm going to tell you just in case

30:34.000 --> 30:36.000
you didn't know this. You need to wise up.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
Linode is the best place to host your stuff.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
For Linux geeks, for people that are speed hounds,

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
for people that want the absolute best

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
flexibility, the best dashboard,

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
the best support. Linode's model is

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
different than the hyperscalers. They work

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
on locking you in and then just selling you more

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
and more services. Linode has a

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
very straightforward pricing structure that's

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
30 to 50% cheaper than the major cloud

30:56.000 --> 30:58.000
providers that are out there. And you go

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
there, everything's right there. It's up front.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
You're not going to get any gotcha surprises on your

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
bill like you do with the hyperscalers. You know

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
what I'm talking about. I've accidentally

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
spent 300 bucks on the bosses credit

31:08.000 --> 31:10.000
card once. I learned that one the hard way.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Linode doesn't do that. And on top of all of

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
that, they've got great services like a powerful

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
DNS manager, S3

31:16.000 --> 31:18.000
compatible object storage cloud

31:18.000 --> 31:20.000
firewalls, physical servers if you need

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
it, database as a service service,

31:22.000 --> 31:24.000
which is actually

31:24.000 --> 31:26.000
really great. And then the other thing that's fantastic

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
is just their standard deployment on any

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
rig has all kinds of sensible defaults

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
for things like alerting about bandwidth

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
or storage. You can take snapshots, you can do automatic

31:34.000 --> 31:36.000
backups, and it's all super

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
clear and easy to understand too.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.000
If you guys can't tell, I'm

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
legitimately a big fan and I think you'll

31:42.000 --> 31:44.000
love it too. And what puts it over the top is that

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
100 bucks, that's Linode coming in with the competence,

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
right? That's Linode coming in

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
saying with 100 bucks, you're actually going to

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
be able to try anything on our platform that you want

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
and you're going to be able to try it for a reasonable

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
amount of time to form an actual opinion.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
That is that's what that 100 bucks is saying.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.000
That's if you think about it, that's a

32:00.000 --> 32:02.000
bold statement. They want you to try it and I think

32:02.000 --> 32:04.000
you're going to love it. So head over to linode.com

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
slash Jupiter. Support this here

32:06.000 --> 32:08.000
crazy office hours production and

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
you get yourself 100 bucks of machines.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
I mean, I don't know what you want to use it for. You could use it for storage.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.000
I suppose that's technically still using a machine.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.000
Linode dot com slash

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Jupiter.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
Brent, you got to go

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
get yourself over there right now because you know what?

32:22.000 --> 32:24.000
That's where I got your node.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.000
Hey, I put I put a node

32:26.000 --> 32:28.000
for Brent up on Linode. Why not? Right?

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
Why not? We kind of just

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
use it for everything. Really?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.000
But what don't we use it for? There are very

32:34.000 --> 32:36.000
few projects that you come up with that

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
doesn't involve Linode, it seems.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.000
Like with the website, we're thinking about, OK, well, what makes sense

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
to store in the object storage

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
at Linode, right?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
And it's just F3 compatible object storage.

32:46.000 --> 32:48.000
So, I mean, you could run a minnow server on your own box

32:48.000 --> 32:50.000
one day and run it there.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.000
I want to mention something.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.000
I touched on this earlier, but

32:54.000 --> 32:56.000
you made me think about it today. So it's your fault.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
You're welcome. You sent me a message saying

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
why are we getting so much spam?

33:00.000 --> 33:02.000
What's going on?

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
And I would characterize. So

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
what we have is we have a Brent and I have a shared

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
office hours chat room.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
And the emails that come into office hours

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
automatically get posted

33:12.000 --> 33:14.000
in this chat room. So that way we can both see them.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
And 95 percent

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
of what comes in to that

33:18.000 --> 33:20.000
inbox is

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
garbage, scam,

33:22.000 --> 33:24.000
marketing. It seems legitimate.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
Oh, they would pay us. They would

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
pay us. They would absolutely

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
pay us. You should see some of the stuff they would

33:30.000 --> 33:32.000
pay us to do. And some of it's like

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
I read one. I just finally broke

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
down and read one of these emails on Coder Radio this

33:36.000 --> 33:38.000
week.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
They want us to sneaky link like

33:40.000 --> 33:42.000
this is just one example. They want us to

33:42.000 --> 33:44.000
sneaky link to gambling websites

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
and put posts on

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
our page that encourage people to click

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
on for real money gambling, as they put

33:50.000 --> 33:52.000
it. And then because they recognize

33:52.000 --> 33:54.000
this is like such a sketch

33:54.000 --> 33:56.000
business to be involved in, they're

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
willing to pay us a premium to

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
do it. They say this in the

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
in the introduction email. Yeah, I read that

34:02.000 --> 34:04.000
one. That was pretty good.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
And

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
they're all like this, right?

34:08.000 --> 34:10.000
So I want you guys to understand

34:10.000 --> 34:12.000
that this is a pervasive problem

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
because Office Hours,

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
it's not a big show, right?

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
It does all right. It does

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
better than the average podcast, but it's not

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
you know, it's not a big

34:22.000 --> 34:24.000
show. And we're getting

34:24.000 --> 34:26.000
a niche of a niche of a niche.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.000
It's a show we're making for people who like

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Jupiter Broadcasting. We just basically

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
don't give any F's. Although I am

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
thinking about maybe changing the name. But anyways, I'll come back to that.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
I like the name, but like so does everybody else

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
every other podcast out there.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
But we're getting this kind of stuff

34:40.000 --> 34:42.000
as a small show. And

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
so you can only imagine how it scales up if

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
you've got any kind of reach and how the offers

34:46.000 --> 34:48.000
get more and more tempting if you have any

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
kind of reach. And this

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
in a nutshell is why nearly all tech

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
media sucks. Not

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
all of it. You know,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
there's definitely people out there

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
that do it right. Some of our

35:00.000 --> 35:02.000
friends do it right.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
But in the Linux niche specifically, it's

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
really, really bad.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
And

35:08.000 --> 35:10.000
this has a side effect

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
of misinforming the community

35:12.000 --> 35:14.000
a lot. So there's a Linux project out there

35:14.000 --> 35:16.000
right now. In my opinion,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.000
based on research and background

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
conversations I've had is like 90%

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
hot air. But

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
they really know

35:24.000 --> 35:26.000
how the tech press works.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
They know the big secret

35:28.000 --> 35:30.000
that I'm going to tell you about. They

35:30.000 --> 35:32.000
already know it because they've been around for a while.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.000
At least the person running it has.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
And the big secret in the tech

35:36.000 --> 35:38.000
press is that

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
the reader or the listener

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
or viewer, depending on what your medium

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
is,

35:44.000 --> 35:46.000
the listener, the viewer, the reader,

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
they are not the customer.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
When you go to like a ZDNet

35:50.000 --> 35:52.000
or an Ars Technico or a register,

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
you're not the customer.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
You guys all know this. You've heard it a million times.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
If you're not paying for it, you're the product.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.000
The tech

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
industry is the customer, specifically

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
the advertisers that exist

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
in the tech industry. But you got to be friendly with

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
the entire tech industry for those advertisers

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
to be friendly with you because it's all

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
about access.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
And as long as the Linux press and tech

36:16.000 --> 36:18.000
press in general make money via ads,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
they're just

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
never going to serve the reader as the customer.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
It's their business model. It's not nefarious.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
It's not evil. It's the business

36:26.000 --> 36:28.000
model. It's simple as that.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
The reader is not the customer.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
The listener is not the customer. The viewer is not the customer.

36:32.000 --> 36:34.000
It's as simple as that.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
I have been doing online media for

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
15 years. I have been

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
making it my primary way to make a

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
living for nearly 13 of those 15

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
years. So I have

36:44.000 --> 36:46.000
some standing here. I'm telling you,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
you're not the customer.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
It's unfortunate because

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
what it means is that they're

36:52.000 --> 36:54.000
more inclined to print puff pieces

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
about a project or a

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
company that probably didn't really

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
earn that coverage. They're less

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
critical because they want to maintain

37:02.000 --> 37:04.000
their access. They want to maintain

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
their network because they live

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
and die on their access to information in these companies.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
And

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
they just

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
do business as a standard practice this

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
way. They don't do it to deceive you.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
There's nothing evil about it.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
It's just the business model. And because

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
paychecks depend on things working this way,

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
I don't think they think about it that much.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
So you'll see nothing but puff

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
articles for companies like Solar

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
Winds or Linux projects that are trying

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
to break into the enterprise that really haven't delivered

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
on anything yet.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
So this is why I go

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
on all the time about membership

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
programs and boosts.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
Because membership programs

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
and boosts

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
keep Jupiter Broadcasting's audience

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
the customer. And it's my job

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
I feel as the editor in chief of JB

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
to make sure that the audience always

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
remains our largest customer.

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
So that's why I think boosts

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
come in. That's where I think membership comes

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
in. It gives you

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
the confidence to know that the

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
audience is our customer.

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Now, of course, I

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
know that the audience has to be

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
the customer because that's ultimately

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
who's going to hold us responsible.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
I know that personally,

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
but it matters that that's how the

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
business sees things, too. Right. You understand

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
like long term

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
the way incentives work, it's necessary

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
that the business also recognize

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
the audience

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
as the primary customer.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
So that's why I feel like boosts

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
are really significant for podcasting

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
because a lot of podcasters

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
don't have the infrastructure or the numbers

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
or the skill or the know-how

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
how to do advertising. Thus

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
that's not really an option for them. But even

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
if they could get advertising, most of them

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
don't know how to do it right. They don't know how to do

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
the reads right. They don't know how to set up relationships

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
right. They don't know how to build boundaries.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
It's very difficult. It's a very

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
pervasive industry. It constantly

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
is pushing on your on your

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
on your line. And you have

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
to have a skill set to push back to while

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
maintaining a friendly relationship. It's

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
a very hard thing to do. And

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
with YouTube, that

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
problem slightly alleviated by the monetization

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
platform that YouTube offers. But the

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
issue there is it incentivizes you to be a slave

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
to an algorithm that makes

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
content that's horrible right.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
But with Boost, there's no algorithm.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
There's no Google

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
auction happening in the background to sell

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
a mattress ad. It's

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
the audience directly sending

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
value to the podcast. And value

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
for value is the only way

39:30.000 --> 39:32.000
to solve this problem at

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
scale on the internet for small

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
creators, large creators,

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
for small free software projects, and

39:38.000 --> 39:40.000
big software projects. It is a

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
fundamental shift in how

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
the business, the project,

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
the creators are incentivized.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.000
So,

39:48.000 --> 39:50.000
with that said,

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
let's get into some of these Boosts.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
Because we do have some great Boosts. I know that was a

39:54.000 --> 39:56.000
really big build up Brent, but I felt like it was important

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
to get that out there because I think people might be

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
missing the message and the noise

40:00.000 --> 40:02.000
with everything going on right now. And we do

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
occasionally get people who, and we're

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
listening, who challenge

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
why we're doing Boosts,

40:08.000 --> 40:10.000
why we're dedicating

40:10.000 --> 40:12.000
such a large

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
time slot in some of the shows

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
for reading Boosts. And I think you

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
mentioned something that I think is worth

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
mentioning here, which is that

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
often in the Boosts, some ideas

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
and projects and like

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
tools and things get

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
mentioned that we would have never had

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
a chance to talk about. And it gives us a little

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
chance to just mention

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
them quickly here and explore them

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
and add to our

40:36.000 --> 40:38.000
toolbox, which is really amazing too.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.000
And share that in a really nice way.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.000
So I know it's had

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
a ton of value for you, even just

40:44.000 --> 40:46.000
seeing the Boosts come in on a daily basis.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
But in terms of like a

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
utility for us as well,

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
I mean, we've gotten a bunch of great tips

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
from the Boosts. So thanks to everybody there.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Yeah. And the other thing that they've been

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
doing, which we didn't expect, is

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
they've been keeping us on our toes about

41:00.000 --> 41:02.000
following up on items that we bring up on the show.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.000
The audience remembers and asks

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
us about it. And we always have

41:06.000 --> 41:08.000
every intention of following up on stuff, but

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
we just got a lot going on. We forget, you know, we're

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
working on the next show. We forget what we talked about the week before.

41:12.000 --> 41:14.000
And the Boosts

41:14.000 --> 41:16.000
have been a great way to kind of keep those threads alive

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
and interject questions or

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
discussion or criticism

41:20.000 --> 41:22.000
that we wouldn't have otherwise brought into the show.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
Right. So they're great from that standpoint

41:24.000 --> 41:26.000
as well. All right. Well, let's

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
do it.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
And now it is time for

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
the Boosts. So Gene

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
boosted in seven days ago

41:34.000 --> 41:36.000
with a big old boost,

41:36.000 --> 41:38.000
30,000 SATs.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
He said, would a desktop OS

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
on a powerful server setup in another

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
room with maybe some

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
sort of thing client in the office,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.000
would that work with horsepower

41:52.000 --> 41:54.000
combined with silence? You could

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
do like the random desktopy things in

41:56.000 --> 41:58.000
VMs or LXC to keep it isolated from

41:58.000 --> 42:00.000
the production grade stuff. Rel or

42:00.000 --> 42:02.000
Alma Linux nine and its super long

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
lifestyle could provide you a stable, slow

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
moving base for the system with

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
things like OBS officially having flat back support.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
You could really probably load whatever is

42:10.000 --> 42:12.000
needed. And he says, P.S.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.000
I updated my boost from 10,000

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
SATs, which is about two dollars and 20 cents

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
to 30,000 SATs, which is about six

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
dollars and 60 cents to help

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Brent with his travel fund. Oh,

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
that's nice. I really like

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
that. That is nice because we have some fun projects

42:26.000 --> 42:28.000
we want to work on. We want to get Brent down here before

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
the September road trip and

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
bang those things out. And so that is very helpful.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
We started a project list, which is

42:34.000 --> 42:36.000
always a dangerous thing for us.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
I like the idea.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
I toyed

42:40.000 --> 42:42.000
around with something like this over the network

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
years ago where I put a powerful box

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
in one room and then just dumb

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
clients throughout the house.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
It does work pretty well.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.000
I don't think it's the right setup here because there are

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
times where we're actually physically needing to plug things

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
and unplug things from the back of the boxes, especially

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
with USB interfaces and cameras.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
What is

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
I'd love to do a project like that.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
I think that'd be so much fun. Awesome

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Matt boosted in seven days ago with

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
nine thousand five hundred

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
and thirty eight.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I sent it in a couple of times

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
so I just combined them just by putting

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
some parts together. I came up with something that looks

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
like this might fit your needs. He's talking about our replacement

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
OBS rig. Relatively

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
small and quiet fifth gen Ryzen

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
for under nine hundred dollars.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
It has Intel Wi-Fi so everything should be compatible.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
And of course you could just

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
tweak it based on your needs. And what

43:30.000 --> 43:32.000
what awesome Matt did is he

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
included a PC part builder link.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.000
So so great. It's like all the

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
parts right here. It's actually a

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
it's a kick butt box. It comes out

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
at like nine hundred and sixty bucks

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
but seeing this makes

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
me feel like yeah we probably could. We probably

43:46.000 --> 43:48.000
would be OK with a DIY

43:48.000 --> 43:50.000
PC again. In the back of my mind

43:50.000 --> 43:52.000
I was like a failure would be awesome

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
under nine hundred and sixty bucks.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
That's a hard price to beat these days.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.000
I know you bought the current one I think

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
with some of your Bitcoin back in the day.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Do you remember what it was sort of equivalent

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
worth back then. I think they were

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
all the machines we bought were right. And we bought

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
like identical machines. I think they were all

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
like right around eight nine hundred bucks.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
They were kind of in that price range.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
One of them I think we put extra disk

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
in so that was slightly more expensive.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
But yeah I was looking back at it.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
It was a cheap time to buy machines

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
compared to some of the prices.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.000
So double boost from Awesome

44:24.000 --> 44:26.000
Matt. One thousand

44:26.000 --> 44:28.000
five hundred and sixty nine sats and just says

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
love you all too. They mentioned he's awesome

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
because he is awesome. Of course it's

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
it's in the name I suppose.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
We got a boost from Delian

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
seven days ago three thousand five

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
hundred sats or Dylan I suppose Dylan

44:40.000 --> 44:42.000
and I really appreciated

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
the discussion about podcast production.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
I've been making my own show casually for a

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
few years to a small audience

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
and I recently switched to value for value.

44:50.000 --> 44:52.000
Question what are you using for

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
soundboard during the boost segment?

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
It's a good question.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.000
So we've used a couple of different apps

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
over the years. There is

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
Sound Ducks D U X for

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
Linux which I like a lot. And then on the Mac

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
Fargo F

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
A R

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
R G O I think.

45:10.000 --> 45:12.000
F A R

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
R A G O I think.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.000
And that's a pretty good app for the Mac as well.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.000
And I think you'll either

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
way you go you'll like it. Just don't go crazy like

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
I do. It'll drive people crazy.

45:22.000 --> 45:24.000
I think also part what he's asking here

45:24.000 --> 45:26.000
is where'd you get the clips that you're using.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
Oh you think so.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
I think maybe. I would

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
I would be asking that as a follow up anyways.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.000
Well here you go. I'm asking as a follow up.

45:34.000 --> 45:36.000
Those you know it

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
depends. Like sometimes I see a boost

45:38.000 --> 45:40.000
come in and I'm inspired to go grab a

45:40.000 --> 45:42.000
soundboard bite for that boost right

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
then and there and I just have to track it down.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
Some of them came from

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
the podcast index guys they have like

45:48.000 --> 45:50.000
on their GitHub they have like a bunch

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
of boost sound clips you can

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
use. And then others are just ones I've collected

45:54.000 --> 45:56.000
over the years. I mean I have

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
I don't know something

45:58.000 --> 46:00.000
like 40 different soundboards. There's one

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
you grabbed recently from

46:02.000 --> 46:04.000
I think it was like a show you're watching or

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
a news piece and it's my favorite

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
so far. Can you give us a taste.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Coming in hot with the boost.

46:10.000 --> 46:12.000
I love that

46:12.000 --> 46:14.000
one. Yeah I got that news report.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Yeah.

46:16.000 --> 46:18.000
It wasn't a news report

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
it was a YouTube car channel.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
That's what it was. And it was this

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
super broken down dilapidated

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
car that they had jacked up

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
and put a massive engine in with

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
the intakes out of the hood and everything like that.

46:30.000 --> 46:32.000
So it's just this junker

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
this total junker. I don't know something

46:34.000 --> 46:36.000
about it I love though. I can't help it.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
We got a double boost from Dilan

46:38.000 --> 46:40.000
3500

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
500 sats double boost tell me if I'm

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
crazy but I previously produced my show using

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
mumble with multitrack recording output

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
and then painstakingly edited the resulting

46:48.000 --> 46:50.000
tracks in Audacity.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
Now I just record live and

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
I edit nothing similar to a twitch or really

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
a video on demand stream. My

46:56.000 --> 46:58.000
co-hosts are in a jitzy me room recording and streaming

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
at the same time with OBS using my desktop

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
PC running mangero smart

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
move or reckless.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
I like

47:06.000 --> 47:08.000
this. This might be a series that

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
is a good that is a good series.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.000
You know I always like going a little reckless. I always

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
do. It keeps it fun

47:14.000 --> 47:16.000
and you don't want it to get

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
boring. I think

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
you went overboard. I think I think where

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
you went wrong Dilan in the past is you went

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
overboard like we have a mumble room here right now.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.000
Hey mumble room. Hi guys. Hello.

47:26.000 --> 47:28.000
Hey hey. Hey they're hanging

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
out with us. They get a low latency open stream

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
but we have never done the individual

47:32.000 --> 47:34.000
track recording simply

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
because of the work overhead right. Each

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
number in the mumble room

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
would become a track. And so

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
if you've got four

47:42.000 --> 47:44.000
twenty thirty people in there that's

47:44.000 --> 47:46.000
four twenty thirty tracks. That's crazy.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
So we do mix the mumble down

47:48.000 --> 47:50.000
to a single track but then

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
each one of our individual hosts is

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
also their own individual track.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
Ultimately

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
you can make it sound

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
significantly better. There's just no

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
if ands or buts about it. Brent's voice

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
is different than my voice

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
and our voices and just the way we're recorded

48:06.000 --> 48:08.000
are different in the mumble room. And

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
so each one of them needs their own EQ

48:10.000 --> 48:12.000
needs their own touch with the compressor.

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
It needs its own pass over.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
Each one has its own unique background noise.

48:16.000 --> 48:18.000
So really you do need to process

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
them separately for really really great audio.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.000
That being said

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
go check out Jupiter tube.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Tell me what you think and then go compare

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
it to the release version

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
of this show. Office Hours 8

48:30.000 --> 48:32.000
will come out on Friday once Drew is done

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
with it. And you can compare Office Hours 8

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
to the PeerTube release

48:36.000 --> 48:38.000
and you can kind of get an idea of what

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
the difference between live to tape is versus

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
fully edited.

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
And I think you'll agree the fully edited is going to

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
sound better. It's going to be better paced.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
It's going to be a little more refined.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
The fully you know live mix

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
version isn't necessarily unwatchable or un-listenable.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
So it's just kind of depending on your

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
on your audience too. And then lastly

48:56.000 --> 48:58.000
what is sustainable for you.

48:58.000 --> 49:00.000
Like none of it really matters if the other

49:00.000 --> 49:02.000
way was just burning you out and you weren't

49:02.000 --> 49:04.000
going to be able to keep it going and now you've found a way where

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
you can keep it going and so the show goes on.

49:06.000 --> 49:08.000
Like ultimately that's what really matters right.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
So I don't think it's reckless.

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
I think if that is the case then I think it was

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
probably a smart move. But don't be

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
afraid to experiment and feel free to use

49:16.000 --> 49:18.000
our show this very episode as an A B

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
because I think that'd be a good little test.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
Get a sense.

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
Our first row of ducks comes in this week from

49:24.000 --> 49:26.000
The Golden Dragon as always.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.000
I'm a duck. D-U-K Duck.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.000
And he's got a question

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
to you with 2,222

49:32.000 --> 49:34.000
sets. Brent what

49:34.000 --> 49:36.000
strategies did you use to learn coding

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
and what have you like say

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
when learning Hugo and what have you

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
learned. I'm trying to learn some dev

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
stuff and I'm looking for strategies to start

49:44.000 --> 49:46.000
coding. Side note

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
I love that I'm basically

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
following the journey of The Golden

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Dragon and his learning

49:52.000 --> 49:54.000
development skills across multiple shows

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
as he boosts into like Coder and Office Hours.

49:56.000 --> 49:58.000
I feel like I'm learning more about him every time.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.000
So what have you found

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
useful Brent when you're trying to pick all this stuff up

50:02.000 --> 50:04.000
and you've been trying to pick it up quick too.

50:04.000 --> 50:06.000
The question was posed in past tense.

50:06.000 --> 50:08.000
What strategies did you

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
learn you know did you use

50:10.000 --> 50:12.000
to learn coding. And I think actually I'm

50:12.000 --> 50:14.000
probably

50:14.000 --> 50:16.000
more likely in the same

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
bolt as The Golden Dragon is

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
I'm just on the very tip of learning.

50:20.000 --> 50:22.000
So I think the number

50:22.000 --> 50:24.000
one thing for me was

50:24.000 --> 50:26.000
and I learned this from Tim Ferriss

50:26.000 --> 50:28.000
of all people is the concept of

50:28.000 --> 50:30.000
being very careful

50:30.000 --> 50:32.000
what you learn.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
It's more important to learn the right thing than

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
it is to learn a bunch of wrong stuff.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.000
If you want to learn Python for instance there's

50:38.000 --> 50:40.000
about like a hundred thousand videos on YouTube

50:40.000 --> 50:42.000
about learning Python which is

50:42.000 --> 50:44.000
actually not that helpful

50:44.000 --> 50:46.000
and it's too bad

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
that there are so many I gotta

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
say. So I before

50:50.000 --> 50:52.000
even diving into any of it

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
just looked at

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
I guess

50:56.000 --> 50:58.000
trying to determine who had quality

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
and recency and who was

51:00.000 --> 51:02.000
getting down to like the very essentials

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
of what someone needs to learn

51:04.000 --> 51:06.000
at first instead of just like

51:06.000 --> 51:08.000
here's how to do all the things and I don't really

51:08.000 --> 51:10.000
know if it's the best way or it's the

51:10.000 --> 51:12.000
the right way to learn

51:12.000 --> 51:14.000
it quickly. Be very discerning

51:14.000 --> 51:16.000
I guess is all of that boiled

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
down to a few words. And so there's

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
one gentleman I think his

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
YouTube channel is HeckWithTim.

51:22.000 --> 51:24.000
I think he works at

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
Microsoft working on

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
I forget now but one of their projects.

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
He is super

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
no fluff

51:32.000 --> 51:34.000
but very complete in his explanations

51:34.000 --> 51:36.000
and it's

51:36.000 --> 51:38.000
like okay here's everything you need

51:38.000 --> 51:40.000
to know for like stage one

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
compressed into like a thirty

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
minute video with chapters

51:44.000 --> 51:46.000
which is such a helpful thing when you're trying

51:46.000 --> 51:48.000
to learn it's like oh I'm trying to learn about

51:48.000 --> 51:50.000
you know Python's

51:50.000 --> 51:52.000
functions. Well maybe

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
you gotta listen to it three or four times.

51:54.000 --> 51:56.000
So that's what I would say. Number one

51:56.000 --> 51:58.000
be super discerning about where you

51:58.000 --> 52:00.000
learn. So my first

52:00.000 --> 52:02.000
research part

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
was like where are people learning

52:04.000 --> 52:06.000
successfully because I don't

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
want to go learn somewhere unsuccessfully. It's a total

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
waste of my time. I have like a hundred

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
other things I want to be doing

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
and so that was super important to me.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
The other thing is like try to find

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
some folks that you know or in the community

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
the JB community even just to recommend some

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
things like some of the back channel

52:22.000 --> 52:24.000
conversations I've had with Wes

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
have been fascinating. So I've been like

52:26.000 --> 52:28.000
oh Wes I'm just kind of like learning this thing but I'm

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
struggling a little bit. Do you have any like tips or tricks?

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
He's like yeah here's four

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
other things you could look at

52:34.000 --> 52:36.000
that are like progressions in your

52:36.000 --> 52:38.000
learning. So having like a

52:38.000 --> 52:40.000
soft mentor like that is actually

52:40.000 --> 52:42.000
super nice too.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.000
So those are two things I think

52:44.000 --> 52:46.000
I would recommend very strongly

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
is careful where you learn

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
and go find someone who can

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
really give you those shortcuts.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
I think you just did.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.000
I think you just did that.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
There you go. Very good.

52:58.000 --> 53:00.000
Cospeelin boosted in

53:00.000 --> 53:02.000
seven days ago with 3690

53:02.000 --> 53:04.000
sats.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Boost. Whoa. This is

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
the first Office Hours I've ever listened to.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
There's a lot more in this show than I thought.

53:10.000 --> 53:12.000
I'd like to make a joke though and I'd like

53:12.000 --> 53:14.000
to say this show sounds like

53:14.000 --> 53:16.000
a podcasting 2.1-RC1

53:16.000 --> 53:18.000
boardroom which he thinks is

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
great. A note about the ads

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
he says I don't mind it when the podcast

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
inserts the ads but the dynamic ads

53:24.000 --> 53:26.000
no good. Thanks for the show.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.000
We totally are following

53:28.000 --> 53:30.000
I mean we don't follow nearly the podcasting

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
2.0 development stuff that obviously

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
the podcasting 2.0 show does. I mean how

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
could we? But I

53:36.000 --> 53:38.000
feel like we're giving it a

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
bit of coverage from a boots

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
on the ground podcaster who is

53:42.000 --> 53:44.000
trying to figure out how to implement this stuff

53:44.000 --> 53:46.000
into his business and

53:46.000 --> 53:48.000
I kind of look at it as

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
a competitive advantage as well like

53:50.000 --> 53:52.000
you know not like it's a bad

53:52.000 --> 53:54.000
competitive but if we can if our shows can have

53:54.000 --> 53:56.000
more features that give you things

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
like chapters and transcripts and more host

53:58.000 --> 54:00.000
information and higher higher

54:00.000 --> 54:02.000
context and all that kind of stuff that's great

54:02.000 --> 54:04.000
right. Why wouldn't we want that stuff and I've

54:04.000 --> 54:06.000
always kind of wanted to have the premium

54:06.000 --> 54:08.000
feature set for our shows. So

54:08.000 --> 54:10.000
I'm following the podcasting

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
2.0 stuff from kind of that perspective

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
and recognizing

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
the shortcomings in the podcast

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
industry recognizing the opportunities

54:18.000 --> 54:20.000
we've missed with mobile

54:20.000 --> 54:22.000
apps and the opportunities that

54:22.000 --> 54:24.000
we've missed by constantly

54:24.000 --> 54:26.000
constantly encouraging people

54:26.000 --> 54:28.000
to do things outside the podcast app

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
which has been detrimental to our growth

54:30.000 --> 54:32.000
in the long term and all that stuff

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
and so I follow it for that purpose and the guys

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
invited me on the podcasting 2.0 show

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
this week so they will

54:38.000 --> 54:40.000
they'll have an episode out on Friday when we do

54:40.000 --> 54:42.000
and go check that out if all

54:42.000 --> 54:44.000
things go as planned I'll be on

54:44.000 --> 54:46.000
that this week's episode.

54:46.000 --> 54:48.000
So I'll share some of my thoughts there.

54:48.000 --> 54:50.000
Next cause Optimus Gray

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
boosts in with

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
a real doozy six

54:54.000 --> 54:56.000
days ago with twenty two

54:56.000 --> 54:58.000
thousand two hundred

54:58.000 --> 55:00.000
and twenty two sats. How

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
about that for a row of ducks. Thank

55:02.000 --> 55:04.000
you very much and here's something

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
for your trouble.

55:06.000 --> 55:08.000
That's a big old granddaddy duck.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.000
He says

55:10.000 --> 55:12.000
for us Jupiter party members

55:12.000 --> 55:14.000
can I ask for possibly a new

55:14.000 --> 55:16.000
feed. If the lightning and boost support

55:16.000 --> 55:18.000
is going to take a while could

55:18.000 --> 55:20.000
we have a separate feed of just the bonus

55:20.000 --> 55:22.000
content like the

55:22.000 --> 55:24.000
you know the post show for self hosted

55:24.000 --> 55:26.000
the coderly and

55:26.000 --> 55:28.000
the non the non like live

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
stuff that goes out into the member feeds.

55:30.000 --> 55:32.000
So then we could subscribe to the normal

55:32.000 --> 55:34.000
feeds and boost like we always do but then

55:34.000 --> 55:36.000
also still get to enjoy the bonus content.

55:36.000 --> 55:38.000
Hope to see you all at the West Coast meetup.

55:40.000 --> 55:42.000
That's a good idea. No that's interesting

55:42.000 --> 55:44.000
just a bonus content feed

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
so you can subscribe to all the regular feeds

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
and then just have one feed. It's just the

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
special stuff we create for the members. How did I

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
never think of that before. We might actually be able to do that quickly.

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
I got to figure out the plumbing

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
but that seems like

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
something I should have thought of. So

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
thanks Optimus.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Those ducks are powerful.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
Those are good

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
ducks. Dave Jones our

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
buddy Dave Jones speaking of podcasting 2.0

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
boosted in two days ago with

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
two thousand one hundred and twelve

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
sats. B O O S T

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
He says Alex Gates is the real deal. He's the

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
smartest developer I ever met. Shout out to

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Alex. He was on the show

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
last week and

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
that's

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
I say high praise from Dave.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
High praise from Dave there Alex. That's pretty

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
good. Oh a guy one boosted

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
in seven days ago.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
Yes I am still listening because

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
we took time off. I thought

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
I thought maybe nobody was listening anymore. You know

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
I thought I don't know the new

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
show relatively small show

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
goes off off the

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
air for almost a month. I thought nobody's

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
listening anymore but oh a guy

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
was and then we got a double boost from oh a guy

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
seven days ago

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
two hundred and twenty two sats baby ducks

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
double boost. I've seen a variety of

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
duck like boxes with AMD Ryzen

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
APU's. I feel like there's something

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
in there for an OBS machine maybe

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
something you're looking for. I think he's right

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
interesting. Those would be well

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
they're not fanless or are they fanless.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
I'm always

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
looking for fanless but why do you think

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
they're not. I don't think the ducks are

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
they might be quiet but if they were super

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
quiet. Yeah

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
that'd be fine. Bird

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
dad zero two thirty four boosted with four

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
hundred and twenty sats

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
coming in hot with the boosts in

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
regards to a bulletproof peer tube setup

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
maybe build a beefy server and have

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
it be the main aggregator of all the streams using

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
something like teleport recent stream

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
restream or NDI.

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
That way the endpoints

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
are flexible and the final output is only an appliance

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
you need to worry about who

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
says he'll send in more feedback

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
via email with more

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
deets. Well that's

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
that's pretty great. That's pretty great

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
and then speaking again

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
of podcasting to know the pod father

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Adam Curry boosts in with ten

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
thousand sats

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
and

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
this is a little bit of brilliance. This

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
we got to take a moment

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
to make space in the show

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
because what the pod father has realized

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
I think is genius. He says

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
Spotify is the shit

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
coin of podcasting and

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
I think he's right because

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
it's hot Spotify highly

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
decentralized implementing

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
proprietary standards

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
going to build and build

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
i.e. pump and pump and pump

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
until they realize there's

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
nothing really behind it. There's no

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
money to be had here and then it will

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
pop and collapse down to

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
some like really crappy product where

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
is Bitcoin decentralized.

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
There is no central

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
authority. There's no Satoshi Nakamoto anymore.

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
He's gone. It's an open protocol.

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
It's been online for 13

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
years widely distributed all over the internet

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
completely decentralized tens

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
of thousands of nodes.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
I think he's right.

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
It's the open standard. I love it

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
that right there is some genius.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
That's what that was pod father. I was

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
what I saw that I'm like that's brilliant.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
That's so brilliant. All right.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
We got another baller boost and this one

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
was a moment for me. This

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
one came from someone who I

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
hear on other podcasts boosting all the time.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
So it was special because

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
I feel a real community

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
is building here in the boosts

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
and we're watching it happen across multiple shows

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
the dreb Scott boosted

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
in three days ago with 33

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
thousand three hundred and thirty

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
three sats

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
I'm a duck D.U.K.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
loaded with talent. I'm giving that

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
a special duck status too. I don't know why but I feel

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
like it. He said I heard about you guys while listening

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
to podcasting to know and Dave mentioned

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
you guys interviewed Alex Gates.

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
I came over to hear Alex and ended up subscribing

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
enjoy the show.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
You know what you get a special boost

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
boost. There you go.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
I believe that's a Fletcher special dreb Scott.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Thank you. I was nice. I felt like

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I just got boosted from a boosting celebrity

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
over there. I got you know I was like a little like

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
dreb Scott boosted the show.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Nice. It's funny like

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
it's a really neat community because I listen to

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
other podcasts and I hear these individuals

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
boosting in and dreb helps with

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
podcasting to those chapters.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
He helps do their community chapters. So great.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Our last big boost

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
of the week came in from this is a great name

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Lord of Bytes three days

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
ago twenty thousand four hundred

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
and eighty sats coming in

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
with the moves. First of all let

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
me say you're the best podcast group out there.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
I've been trying to get into Linux for ten

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
years. Every time I start to play with Linux

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I lose interest in a couple of months.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
It wasn't until I found you all

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
that I really started getting into Linux

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
your shows in the community keep me inspired

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
every day to learn something new in Linux.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I also love that I'm getting involved

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
in my first open source project helping out with the new

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
website. Keep up the amazing

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
work. Yeah I was just going to say Lord of Bytes

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
have been sharing a whole bunch of

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
great insights and stuff and working hard.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
So thank you.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
We love you. Value for value in multiple

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
ways there Lord of Bytes. Thank you.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
How incredible. Really

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
good to see.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Oh

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
bring a tear to my eye. And then

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
we do have a couple of thank you boosts

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
that I wanted to get out there. We got five hundred

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
sats from Al Carney pointed out

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
that you know maybe the Linux Foundation being on

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Spotify not so bad. Maybe it'll

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
bring in new listeners and new users to

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Linux. I remain skeptical

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
but that was their boost.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Four hundred fifty sats from a listener

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
letting us know. Yeah I am

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
still out here too. And then thirty

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
thirty sats. That's right.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Three thousand thirty sats from Marcel

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
another V4V legend says he's still

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
listening. Thanks for the show.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
And he liked our fake mattress ad.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
That's great. That is great.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
I want to say thank you to the Mumble Room for joining

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
us live. You guys

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
are fantastic. We chat a lot in the pre and post show.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Maybe you know what we ought to do

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
like an open Q&A episode.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Get some questions ahead of time

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
let the Mumble Room ask questions

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
because that's part of the idea of office hours is

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
people might want to know what's going on

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
have input something like that. So maybe

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
we plan to do that in the next episode if I remember.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
So get your Mumble client ready

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
because you can pop in you can ask us questions

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
or get clarifications. We have

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
details at Linux Unplugged dot com slash

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Mumble. We'll probably eventually have a Mumble page

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
on the new Web site. Right. It's

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
on my personal to do list.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Someone asked me today they're like are you working on

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
this. Should I work on this or are you

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
working on this. Like no no. Soon

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
soon. That'll be great.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Meanwhile you're going to be hanging out

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
there at Alex's pad watching the

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
place for him while he gets ready for the

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
London meetup on the 5th at 6 p.m.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
local time. That's that's getting really

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
close. Mm hmm.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Yeah man. And then we have

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
a big batch of

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
West Coast meetups. The Times

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
and like the general

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
vicinity's are now all posted at

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
meetup dot com slash Jupiter broadcasting

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
then we're going to ultimately end up a

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
JPL. By the time we do the next

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
episode we should have the form

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
available. We're going to do an audience lottery we'll

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
have. I think what we're going to do is a next

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
cloud form that you can fill out and then we'll

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
use a tool to randomize the results.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
We'll pull a list of primary

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
winners and secondary winners so that way if people

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
know show we have backup list we can call on and

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
stuff like that. We'll have details

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
on the GPL lottery

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
soon. We're just trying to

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
figure out a fair way to do it so that way we can get

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
about you know

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
15 JB 20

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
JB community members inside

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
for a very special tour from

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Tim Canum the operations

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
lead I believe of the Mars

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Linux Copter at JPL.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Very excited about that. And on the

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
way down to JPL and

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
on the way back up we'll

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
be doing multiple meetups

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
and all the details are at meetup dot com

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
slash Jupiter broadcasting.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Up first those that London meetup then

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
the West Coast tours will be coming up.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
I think that's everything Brett.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
You feel like that's everything. That's a pretty good show.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
I think. Yeah. Yes we should say

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
if you'd like this if you'd like to send a boost in

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
you could go to new podcast apps dot com

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
and I've been loving Fountain. I'll put

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
my referral link in the show notes.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I don't know if it gets me anything anymore

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
but it might make it so

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
you can follow me and then see the clips I publish.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes for Fountain.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Podverse is really great too.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
And you're going to see that embedded on our

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
new website very soon. Very excited about that.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
And then of course there's a whole bunch

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
of apps like Boost CLI

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Breeze so you don't if you

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
don't want to switch podcast apps that's all at new podcast

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
apps dot com. You can send a boost in that

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
way. You can send us an email if you go to

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
office hours dot hair we have a contact form

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
over there. We also have

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
our RSS feed so you can subscribe

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
and then we do the show live

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
on Tuesdays at noon

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern over at

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Jupiter dot tube. We publish on Fridays

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
but we do the show live on Tuesdays

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
every fortnight. Right.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Not every Tuesday but every fortnight. Thank you.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Every fortnight. It's just Jupiter

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
dot tube for all that stuff where you can

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
also watch the archive. We have a calendar.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
It is on the calendar. You're right. Jupiter broadcasting

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
dot com slash calendar. We've got a calendar

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
on the new site too right. It's just the same

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
thing. So far it's just the same

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
thing. It works. It's not beautiful

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
but it works. You know what's funny is

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Stephen was going to join us

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
here for this office hours and he and I

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
were like sitting there trying to figure out

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
like time zones. He's like when's the show

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
live. I was like you're in like I think

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
plus 10 from my time zone

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
but I'm in a different time zone now and

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
JB is one behind my usual. So

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
I was trying to do all the math and then we

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
were like oh wait we have a calendar

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
for this.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I forget it too. I forget it too.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
But it does convert to your local time zone.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
I mean we invested millions of dollars

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
in those time zone robots.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
That's the AI that we have in our site.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
And if you haven't caught

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Brent's recent brunches

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
they are now posted at extras.show

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Some great conversations

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
over there. So go check those out.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Alright that's everything.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Get out of here. It's my

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
office. You're just visiting.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I appreciate you but you gotta

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
go. Thanks for coming. See you

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
next time.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Bye bye.
