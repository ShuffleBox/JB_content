1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So, is it Stefan or Stephon?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Because I keep realizing I'm saying it both ways.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
No, Stefan is fine.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's my fault. French Canadian coming out.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh, it is absolutely Brent's fault.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sorry.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No, it's just 100% your fault.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We already discussed this in the LUTpo show.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm fine with it.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Brent.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I know. I'm trying my best.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But, you know, language equals heart.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Jeremy, yeah, I know.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I know for sure.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You understand, right?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Brent gets drunk.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He starts talking in French.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's the tea that gets to me.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The tea.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's Office Hours.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
With me, Chris.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Brent's here too.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Welcome in, everybody.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hello.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm here.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You know, I put out a candle.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I lit it a good hour before we got in here.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That way people think it smells good all the time.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What's that flavor?

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I can't quite pinpoint it.

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's bacon.

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, yeah, right.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The sizzling was missing, so I couldn't quite pinpoint that.

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I got it from a place called Mandles.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Not far from the studio.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Real place.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Really sells stuff like that.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We got a special show today.

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This episode of Office Hours.

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm glad you're joining us.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
To make things extra special,

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the star of the show,

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
the man, the legend,

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
the community leader,

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
our website hero,

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mr. Stefan is back.

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hello, Stefan.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Welcome into the office.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hi. Thanks for having me.

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Thank you for being here.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You know I mean it when I say it.

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
First of all, you've been doing a hero's amount of work

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to see the work in progress.

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But you've also inspired

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
a lot of community members

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to get in and start working

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and just cranking through

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
all this stuff.

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We really are seeing something come together

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
that I think is pretty special.

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I thank you for that too.

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I think you led the way on that

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
and people followed your lead.

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Thank you for that too.

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm not sure if I can claim that on me.

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm happy for the community.

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The community is great

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
and pretty smart.

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They know what they're doing

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
and they're coming up with stuff

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
where I really need

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
a second to process what's happening

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and so on.

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There are a lot of talented people

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
in the community.

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But also,

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Kiro is also doing

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
tons of work.

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Without him,

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I would be so far behind.

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So he's doing a lot of the...

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He did all the content

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
parsing and so on so that we

84
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
have the content we can work with.

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He's like

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
super consistent and super helpful

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and it's really been

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
a pleasure working with him also.

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Brent, it's been pretty great watching

90
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
the GitHub stats and

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
everything come together. We've had some big

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
development since our last Office Hours.

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah, I was a little astounded because

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
a few days ago I pulled some of those

95
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
stats and put them in our little

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
show doc for this show. And this morning

97
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I had to update it because it had almost doubled.

98
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So in the last 30 days or so

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
there's like 13 authors who have published

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
112 commits.

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yeah.

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Stefan's like, oh man, I just spend all my time looking at

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
pull requests and stuff these days

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
instead of actually building

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
things, which is sort of an interesting problem.

106
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's an interesting problem to

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
have. It's also like

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
a bit of a

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
challenge for me to do it this way

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
because, and this is

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
also something we realized, so we

112
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
went from my MVP

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
project side

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
to the official

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Jupyter Broadcasting repository.

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And that

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
like brought a lot of attention

118
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
to the whole

119
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
project. And

120
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
yeah, then we realized, I mean before

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
it was just Brent,

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Kiro and myself working on

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
that. And we had like

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
a good report and everybody

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
had his own little part

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
of the project. So Kiro

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
was all the scraping,

128
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Brent a lot was the content and me

129
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
was the site and the build process itself

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and so on. And now you have

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
like input everywhere and every

132
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
process and people chiming in

133
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and then you need

134
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to make sure that the

135
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
vision is like

136
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
upholded, but the vision

137
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
never was clearly defined.

138
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And I think that was like

139
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
yeah, I underestimated

140
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
what we

141
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
what would change if we make it public

142
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
so soon and that

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
you need to put out like a lot of information

144
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
what you want to achieve and

145
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
what is important for you and

146
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
how people can best contribute

147
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
because otherwise it's a frustrating

148
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
experience for everybody

149
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
who wants to contribute and then

150
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't have the time to explain something

151
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
or they're working on something

152
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I completely didn't intend

153
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
because I was unspecific

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and so on. And so my role

155
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
changed like a lot

156
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
or is changing. Yeah, it's really

157
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
interesting. This is the very first time I

158
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
well, two things a

159
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
contribute so deeply to like

160
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
an open source spirit project, which

161
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
has been a ton of fun.

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But be of course

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
also am one of the people

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
who are trying to organize all of this work.

165
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So I'm learning a ton and

166
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
one of the things now that I'm

167
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
spending most of my time on before it was

168
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
writing content and stuff like that.

169
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But now it's just trying to organize things

170
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and to

171
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
we have been using

172
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
the GitHub issues as tickets for

173
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
features and ideas and like

174
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
asking questions and things like that.

175
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And previously

176
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
just like two or three weeks

177
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
ago, we were just listing those things

178
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and the small

179
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
tiny group of people who are working on the project

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
understood all of the assumptions.

181
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So, you know, a ticket idea might

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
just be make

183
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
community page and there was no other

184
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
information. And so we quickly realized

185
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
that's not helpful

186
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
to a group of 10 plus, you know,

187
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
13 plus people who are working on stuff.

188
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
So I've it's been interesting

189
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
that I've had to be

190
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
much more intentional about

191
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
what we're trying to achieve on

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
each ticket and define

193
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
ideas to look at or

194
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
ask for ideas or even just

195
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
like here's the vision

196
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and that's been actually super helpful to

197
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
define what the end goal

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
is. It's been really fascinating

199
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
actually to work with so many people

200
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and it's been great. And the suggestions on

201
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
how to solve certain problems have been equally

202
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
great. Equally great. So thank you to everyone.

203
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
And also, Brent, I must say I

204
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
think you're doing a stellar job.

205
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Thanks. I would not have

206
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
guessed that this is like your first time

207
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
doing something like that. And it's really

208
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
helping me out. I mean, maybe

209
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you don't feel that way

210
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
or I don't know, but it's

211
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
really appreciated and it helps out

212
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
because that's

213
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
like you

214
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
help out in areas where I'm not

215
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
so good. So

216
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
it's really good.

217
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So you don't mind the giant list of

218
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
assigned tickets I give you in the morning.

219
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I wouldn't go that far, but

220
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I manage. Yeah.

221
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
So yeah, you

222
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
are managing. It's been great. But you are right

223
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
when we opened it up to the public, we got

224
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
we got we get people that are working

225
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
on stuff by the time I go to sleep and by the time I wake

226
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
up, something's been created.

227
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And so we've been feeling like

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
it's probably time to focus

229
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
because what I realized

230
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and I think Brent probably realized pretty recently

231
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
too, is with this road

232
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
trip we have coming up in September,

233
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
we really have a hard deadline

234
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
of getting this done in August.

235
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And that means we really probably have

236
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to kind of focus on very specific things

237
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
to get that done. And I

238
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
feel like I'm

239
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
only really starting to wrap my head around it now because

240
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
well, it's part of

241
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
the squeaky wheel problem also, but we've been

242
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
really asking ourselves what role does the

243
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
website serve and what

244
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
will it serve in the future as we kind of start

245
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
our migration process away from fireside

246
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and we migrate to more

247
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
of building our own back end infrastructure

248
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and that has

249
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
sort of meant that there's

250
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
been times where I've felt like, well, okay, we should

251
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
do things like generate the RSS feeds from the website

252
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and then there's a time later I'm like, actually, no,

253
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
now that I think about it, that's not going to work. We can't

254
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
do that. And so I've been looking at what

255
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
do we still have ahead of us and what can we trim?

256
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And I'm curious if either

257
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
one of you have thoughts on areas

258
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
that we should probably look at just

259
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
focusing in on just for the next

260
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
few weeks so that way we can make the

261
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
flip over without

262
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
losing track of two that we could probably use some

263
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
more help with design too. But

264
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
curious on your thoughts on that.

265
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah, it's true. So

266
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I had a bit of a

267
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
not a breakdown, but I was

268
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
getting a bit nervous and I was

269
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
contacting Brent

270
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
on Sunday and I was like, we can

271
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
continue like this. And I realized

272
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
that was maybe a bit more dramatic

273
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
than I intended, but

274
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I just wanted to say that

275
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
exactly what Chris said

276
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
that we need to focus on what

277
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
we can really achieve in the next three to

278
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
four weeks because it's not more

279
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
and be realistic about it. So

280
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I was down with COVID for a week,

281
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
which was not fun and

282
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
impacted my productivity.

283
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And

284
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
so we really need to

285
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
be realistic and also

286
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
be honest in

287
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
we won't stop when

288
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
we release.

289
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I mean, we just continue. We just

290
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
need to know what we need to have

291
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
to start the transition

292
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and then work on it. And we're calling

293
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
it milestone one. And I think

294
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
we will in this week

295
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
clean up the tickets a bit

296
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and really assign tickets

297
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
that will go into milestone one,

298
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
which we really need for production

299
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and then make a milestone two.

300
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And that's like four weeks after

301
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
going live what we want to

302
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
add feature wise next.

303
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And yeah, we really need to hunker down

304
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
on on milestone one and get that done.

305
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah, it's the

306
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
final crunch is approaching. And

307
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
so now it's like, OK, what do we have to have to

308
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
just get this thing, you know, to launch off

309
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
the ground? Because scale

310
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
engine has very

311
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
politely been reminding us

312
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
that their deadline is serious and that they

313
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
are out of the WordPress hosting business and they'd

314
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
really like us gone by the end of summer. So

315
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
we got to do it.

316
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And I understand. And we do have a

317
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
few details to figure out on

318
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
like back end hosting stuff and whatnot.

319
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But we have a lot of options.

320
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
So in some ways it feels like that's in

321
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
not that it's unimportant, but it's

322
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
not a critical decision,

323
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
whereas like

324
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
what do we work on? What do we pass

325
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
for now? That feels a little

326
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
more critical. And there may be things that

327
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
you know,

328
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
we could, like you said, we just don't need

329
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
in in version one or phase

330
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
one or milestone one.

331
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And so that includes like the whole

332
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
process. So I am

333
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
this multi site workflow

334
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I already created so

335
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
that we can

336
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
in the future not use

337
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
fireside anymore, but using

338
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
to build everything that can

339
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
take a bit of a backseat

340
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
because that's not needed to like right away.

341
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We don't need to replace the fireside sites.

342
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And so that's

343
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
like a lot of work

344
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
that can be done later.

345
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But and I feel like

346
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
we are

347
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
feature wise, we are like

348
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
there. So we could

349
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
easily, I think

350
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
switch over because like the

351
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
episodes are there. You can use

352
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
the video player, the audio players

353
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
and also thanks

354
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
to Keyroad who implemented the

355
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Podverse player, right?

356
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah. Also a special shout

357
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
out that Mitch from the Podverse project has

358
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
joined and that has been great too to see.

359
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
And they figured that

360
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
out by themselves. So I

361
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
had like zero input.

362
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Keyroad needed to explain some stuff to me.

363
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So yeah, and

364
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
it was really, yeah

365
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
all his work and

366
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
yeah, that's working good now.

367
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's a great example. People have swooped in and really

368
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
helped out. You're right. We are really close.

369
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I have like a couple of controversial hot takes

370
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
just in design wise. Like I actually

371
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
don't, I don't really want the video

372
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
player on the episode pages. The reason

373
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
why we have a video player on the existing

374
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
JB site is a limitation

375
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
in the WordPress theme. And if

376
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
we don't put something there, the page doesn't

377
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
render properly. So we've just been embedding the

378
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
video. But we don't really need it. And that

379
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Podverse player is so great. That could be front and

380
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
center or right around that area.

381
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But yeah, that kind of stuff. There's a few other notes, but all

382
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
small stuff. I think you're right. We're close

383
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and we could always iterate on the design too

384
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
once it's done. And so I'm

385
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
really pleased with like the build times.

386
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So every time you commit something

387
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
the site gets built and then deployed.

388
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It sure does. It's incredible.

389
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So I mean, it's generating like

390
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
21,000 sites

391
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
and deploys it in like

392
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
under two minutes.

393
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's insane. And that's

394
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
like GitHub free tier runners

395
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
and so on. So that's nothing fancy.

396
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And I think try doing that

397
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
with Jacket or something like that and

398
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
will be like probably

399
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
25 minutes

400
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
or 30 minutes. I mean, it sounds

401
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
so not important,

402
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
but if you do a lot of changes

403
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and do a lot of deployments, you want

404
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
to make it fast and also

405
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
like locally when you do stuff

406
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
you want it to be fast.

407
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And so I really

408
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
like that. Yes, the chat room is

409
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
asking, Dan's asking in our Matrix

410
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
live chat. Yes, we're using Hugo

411
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
to generate the site. It just

412
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
it sort of worked out to be the perfect tool

413
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
for the job. I had had it in the back of my mind

414
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
for years as a possible

415
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
replacement. But you know, it gives us something

416
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
to work with. It's tooling that people can understand

417
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and then the output is just a really

418
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
nice, flat, fast website,

419
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
you know, and which is sort of what I feel

420
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
it's the opposite of what WordPress gives you

421
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
in a lot of ways. So I also did like a lot

422
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
of WordPress sites in the past, but not

423
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
like for the last eight years

424
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
or so because I just couldn't

425
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
stand it anymore. And

426
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
so I really like Hugo because

427
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
you doesn't

428
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
need maintenance. It's like

429
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
super fast. You can't get any faster

430
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
and it's like

431
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
it doesn't need fancy hosting.

432
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Has it been much of a barrier for people

433
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
coming in to work on the project? Have you noticed that

434
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
or are people picking it up pretty easily?

435
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
All at the same time. I was new to Hugo,

436
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
new to GitHub,

437
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
new to Git itself

438
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
and kind of new

439
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
to setting up a development environment locally

440
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
as well. But even with

441
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
just the very super

442
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
minimal documentation that you had up

443
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
on the MVP site a while ago

444
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and it's pretty straightforward to get in there.

445
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Now I did get like an exclusive

446
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
tour of how Hugo works thanks

447
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
to Stefan and we spent like, I don't know,

448
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
three hours or something hanging out doing

449
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
that. But I have found

450
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
that the structure is fairly simple and

451
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
as long as you understand a

452
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
few little principles, most

453
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
of it is fairly readable. And so

454
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
you know making

455
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
modifications, especially to content

456
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
has been very straightforward

457
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and that was the whole point was to make it sort

458
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
of very markdown friendly,

459
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
easy for hosts to go in there

460
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and change information and

461
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
make a few little tweaks. So I found that

462
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
quite nice. Now

463
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I can't speak to the backend

464
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
stuff and what's happening there.

465
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Other people have dove in and it seems

466
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
fairly friendly.

467
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What interests me is like do you prefer it

468
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
compared to like

469
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
a WordPress backend, like

470
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
a web front end? Do you like

471
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
the workflow of just using your text editor

472
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
and doing stuff? I mean I love it

473
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
because that's how I do, you know,

474
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
my own personal notes. That's how I record

475
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
things in my own knowledge base. I've just

476
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
got a bunch

477
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
text notes in Nextcloud

478
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
or whatever. And I would say

479
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
we have a dream.

480
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
We have a dream talk.

481
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The show doc

482
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
is the source of truth one day and

483
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
we put everything in the show doc, guest

484
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
information, links, everything, show

485
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
description and we maybe have certain

486
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
specific

487
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
things we put in there to make it clear to anything

488
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
reading the doc that this is host, this is guest,

489
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
these are links. We accommodate

490
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
that and then you basically feed

491
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
that to whatever is generating the

492
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
website and then goes and generates all

493
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
the feeds and generates all of the posts

494
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
on YouTube and everywhere else.

495
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
One day. That's really the dream

496
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
and so our workflow

497
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
would technically be text, although we

498
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
use Hdocs, which is a markdown

499
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
real time editor in the web,

500
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
but it's just stored as text

501
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
in the database that we would probably

502
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
be pulling and then using

503
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
one day. We're not there.

504
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Cairo again did something in this regard

505
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
because he built this content

506
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
scraper and it's running now once a

507
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
day and looks for new episodes

508
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and then automatically adds it to

509
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
the current site. So that's basically

510
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
that.

511
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's really neat.

512
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm

513
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
super happy how it turned out, but

514
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm also like, I like that

515
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
we are using plain Hugo

516
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
without any Node.js tooling and so on.

517
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
There was a bit of a discussion

518
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
in the community. We should use Node.js

519
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and so on and so on and more JavaScript

520
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
and I am a bit

521
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
reluctant to adding that. So my

522
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
idea is keep it as simple

523
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
as possible. I really like

524
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
that you just need Hugo as a binary

525
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
to do everything. Also like

526
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
the stylesheet compilation and

527
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
all that stuff is done by Hugo and

528
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
you don't need the whole Node.js

529
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
setup and so on because setting up Node.js

530
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
can really be annoying, especially

531
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
if you are not

532
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
experienced in that. So it

533
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
can be rather painful.

534
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
So we have like in the community

535
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
people from all kinds

536
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
of backgrounds and I want to

537
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
make it as easy as possible and

538
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
saying to them, you just need the

539
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Hugo binary and that's it.

540
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Makes it like super

541
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
easy to enter.

542
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Approachable, but also we were talking about

543
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
this with Wes behind the scenes because

544
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
we like to make sure that Wes has

545
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
his input on any of the tech decisions

546
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
we are making and for us the

547
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
advantage of it just being the Hugo binary

548
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
keeping it really simple and not making any Node

549
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
dependencies is it makes

550
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
our deployment and server

551
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
strategy super portable

552
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
where we A. can

553
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
shop around if we ever need to.

554
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Don't know, we might not need to, but it's nice to have that

555
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
ability. But B. it makes it

556
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
just a simpler maintenance thing for us long term,

557
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
right? And so that to us

558
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
is extremely valuable,

559
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
especially considering a lot of the fancier

560
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
stuff we could do outside the

561
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
website and then just put the results on the website.

562
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm not necessarily a

563
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
100% opposed to doing

564
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
something that adds a lot of value,

565
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
but I totally am agreement

566
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
with you, Stefan. It's like we keep it simple,

567
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
keep it down to the binary. We keep it portable. We

568
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
keep it approachable by new developers and

569
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
we make it easier for JB to maintain.

570
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I mean, 10 years

571
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
we've had the current website 10, 11

572
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
years in different iterations.

573
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So that's the kind of timeline

574
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
we could be looking at here.

575
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And I mean, you always

576
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
should consider when you're introducing

577
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
complexity that the value is there.

578
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's not just complexity for complexity

579
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
sake or for like superficial

580
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
benefits.

581
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And all of this is open source,

582
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
right? So if we keep it simple

583
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and we keep it understandable, it's possible

584
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
another podcast group could take

585
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
this work and they could deploy something that meets

586
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
their needs. And the simpler we keep it,

587
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
the more likely that is to happen too.

588
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
There's that element. It's not like totally

589
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
driving every decision, but it's

590
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
as we do some of this stuff, it's in the back of my mind.

591
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yeah. And also that's why I chose

592
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
like we have the CSS framework

593
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
called Bulma. I chose

594
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
it because it's like super simple.

595
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It is only CSS and HTML

596
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
components

597
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and has no like JavaScript and

598
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
anything doesn't make any assumptions

599
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
what you want to use it for.

600
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And it's just very

601
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
extensible and very good documented.

602
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And it's also like serving

603
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
us well, I guess, because the community,

604
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
the people who didn't know Bulma

605
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
kind of start to liking

606
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
it. And yeah,

607
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
it's a good framework how

608
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
we can introduce new components and

609
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
so on. So that's not like super chaos

610
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and yeah, better

611
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
to style. Yeah. So

612
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I think that's also good.

613
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And also like, yeah, on the design front,

614
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
we have like a lot of stuff still

615
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
to do and clean it up and

616
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
so on because that's like

617
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
the least important part or the

618
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
parts that has not many

619
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
unknowns. So it's not like a risky

620
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
part. You just need to some hours

621
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
sit yourself there and

622
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
clean it up. The design can be extra

623
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
tricky too, because like that is

624
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
something that is, you know,

625
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
it's touching on the brand identity a bit too.

626
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
So it's like we probably want to loop in some JB

627
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
people on that and that could take time,

628
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
but we do need the help with the design.

629
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's all up on our GitHub and we do have

630
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
the matrix chat room as well where people can

631
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
collaborate. Reese has recently been jumping in looking

632
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
at some of that stuff. There's been some folks

633
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
there, but Brent, you have probably a better read on it than I do,

634
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
but it feels like that's still an area where maybe

635
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
we could use some additional help

636
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
as design. And if you go to

637
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
jupitabroadcasting.net and take a look at it, you probably

638
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
see some areas that could use some sprucing. Yeah,

639
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I mean, the episode page itself

640
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
definitely needs some love.

641
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So it's just like the

642
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
bare content just here

643
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
it is. I mean, we're

644
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
not winning any awards with that.

645
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You know, this is

646
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
version one. I have

647
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I've been trying to be pretty diligent

648
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
about putting design

649
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
tags on some of the issues that touch

650
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
on design stuff. And I did just

651
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
this morning write some pretty

652
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
clear, maybe guiding

653
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
tips for

654
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
what we need those pages to be

655
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
some thoughts on just like

656
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
hey, this could move here. This could move here

657
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
like very clear for

658
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
some of the conversations Chris, you

659
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
and I and Wes had recently

660
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
about that. I've also

661
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
tagged them as like good

662
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
first issue because I think someone who has some

663
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
design background

664
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Hugo makes it

665
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
pretty approachable to kind of work on some of that

666
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
stuff. And we've gotten a few people from

667
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
websites like firstgoodissue.com

668
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
and stuff like that that have come in

669
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and had a look and some community members

670
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
who've kind of bitten on those

671
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
strategies of mine and it's working. So

672
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I think we're getting there. We could use a little bit

673
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
more help, I think. But there's certainly

674
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
an issue that we can link to that

675
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
clearly states

676
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
at least five things that I

677
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
think need to happen right away as a priority.

678
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
We can throw that in the notes.

679
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yeah. Also, I think

680
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
design or web design

681
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
doesn't scale well with different

682
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
or with multiple users. So there's

683
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
like you need to have like a clear

684
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
vision and like two, three

685
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
people really coming up with how they wanted

686
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
to look and then other people

687
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
to execute. But I think

688
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
the design itself

689
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
doesn't scale well as like a development

690
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
process of code or so.

691
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's like a bit tricky.

692
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And I mean, it's like your brand

693
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
and you must

694
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
like decide what

695
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
you want, right?

696
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
So you must be happy

697
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
with it.

698
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's a really good point. Thankfully, you know,

699
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I think as a photographer and working with a lot of designers,

700
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
maybe I'm well suited to at least

701
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
be a guiding light on that. I can't

702
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
do the implementations, but

703
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
certainly I can provide a little bit of guidance.

704
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
So I'll keep doing that for sure.

705
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But we have really good people for

706
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
implementation.

707
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Okay, I see what you're saying.

708
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You're saying get to it.

709
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Yeah, all right. I love it here.

710
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
They just need to be

711
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
told or explained

712
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
what to do and then they

713
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
can do it. I have

714
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
no doubt. Yeah, that touches on something I've been

715
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
impressed by actually in the last

716
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
even two weeks. It's like every time I come up

717
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
with an idea because I'm trying to use

718
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
the jupyterbroadcasting.net

719
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
site as my main

720
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
resource whenever I'm working

721
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
on our show episodes and stuff like

722
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
that so that I can see, you know,

723
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
how does it fit into my usual everyday

724
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
workflow? And then it

725
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
becomes quickly obvious like, oh, wait a second.

726
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Like I don't want tags first. I want a description

727
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
or hey, there's some hosts missing

728
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
or something like that. So it's been a great way

729
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
to just kind of test the site and

730
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
see some of the features that

731
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I kind of wish were there and some functionality

732
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
that we currently have on the current website

733
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
that's maybe missing. So that's been great.

734
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
But I've been impressed

735
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
mostly by how I can just like,

736
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
you know, of course, late at night

737
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
dream up features that

738
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I wish were there like, oh, I'm going to make a ticket

739
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
for this thing. That would be nice. Oh, I'm going to

740
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
make another ticket for this other thing that like

741
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I don't know if we could do that, but that would be nice.

742
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
And it's amazing. Like sometimes then

743
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
I'll, you know, do an eight hours of

744
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
sleep and wake up and someone's already done it.

745
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
And it's insane.

746
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
A huge thank you

747
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
to everybody who's just like picked up

748
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
some of these random ideas and made them happen in a

749
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
short amount of time. It's been really impressive. So

750
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I think, yeah, I

751
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
can't say enough good things about that.

752
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
And it also seems like everybody

753
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
is like having a good time, having fun,

754
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
which is also, I think, always important

755
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
if you work on something

756
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
in your free time, it

757
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
should be enjoyable and

758
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
the people should be nice and they

759
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
should be good to each other, which they all

760
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
are because it's like a stellar community.

761
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
And yeah,

762
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
it's really, it's

763
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
work, but it's also like fun.

764
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I've caught Kiro

765
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
mentioning in our matrix chat a few

766
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
times that he's like, oh geez,

767
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I wish I didn't have this day job so I could just keep

768
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
working on this project.

769
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The best community, really.

770
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
And it's such a great demonstration

771
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
of the value for value stuff that we've been talking

772
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
about, right? It's not a monetary thing.

773
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
But it's so immensely valuable

774
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
and the website has needed

775
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
this for so long.

776
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Right?

777
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Are you now like a bit like

778
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
why didn't we do this sooner?

779
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Perhaps. Yeah, I mean, maybe.

780
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
It was, you know,

781
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
there's always so many things to be working on.

782
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Not every time we've opened something up

783
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
to the community has it gone super well because

784
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
you know what I think, you noticed

785
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
when we went public

786
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
with it, how a lot of things changed.

787
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
That's generally how we have started a lot of

788
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
projects in the past is we just boom,

789
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
start from the very beginning like that and it just kind of goes in a hundred

790
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
different directions.

791
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
So I think, you know, this time it

792
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
had a little bit different of a trajectory

793
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
because we kind of started

794
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
it low key and

795
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
then we started talking about it on office hours

796
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and that's really kind of like,

797
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
you know, the core JB audience.

798
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's like the JB completionists

799
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
that are listening to all the shows are catching office hours.

800
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
So it's a smaller group. And then when

801
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
we put it on the GitHub and, you know,

802
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
started the matrix room, it just sort of

803
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
blew up from there. But having that kind of

804
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
staged growth, I think helped

805
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
us get a few key individuals like yourself

806
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
in and get a few things established

807
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
before it just went totally

808
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
haywire. That was the missing recipe

809
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I think that made it actually get traction

810
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
this time. Also,

811
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
I really think having GitHub involved makes

812
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
a big difference. Like we've really debated this in the past.

813
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Should we use our own GitLab?

814
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Should we use something else? Or should we go

815
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
on GitHub? And I think it made a difference

816
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
this time organizing this on GitHub.

817
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I think that also helped.

818
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Because everybody

819
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
who works now on the JB

820
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
site now gets like

821
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
progression on GitHub and

822
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
represents and so on.

823
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I mean, I'm always like happy when I

824
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
see the green dots every day and I think

825
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
yeah, I've done something good

826
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
and everybody sees it.

827
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
That's nice.

828
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
We're passing around screenshots

829
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
internally of it, you know, watching it.

830
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So everybody's watching it. It's great.

831
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I think that's been a factor.

832
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
And it feels great to actually have

833
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
this accomplished now because we had to pull

834
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
it off now. I don't know what we were going to do.

835
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Maybe I was just going to throw together some really crappy Hugo

836
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
site that would have been really bad. I don't know what

837
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I would have done. So, pretty

838
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
great. Like I say, it's been

839
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
extremely valuable for us and we're just really grateful.

840
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
We've got 13 people now working

841
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
on that. That's not nothing.

842
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Well, and in the matrix room as well, there

843
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
are more than 30 people discussing

844
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
ideas and stuff like that.

845
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And some people joining every single day.

846
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
So I think it's

847
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
trending in kind of an amazing direction.

848
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
It's great. I don't know at which

849
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
point I'll be overwhelmed, but I'll let you guys know.

850
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I need

851
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
help. I need help. You can't be overwhelmed,

852
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Brent.

853
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
What will I do then?

854
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You know, I need you

855
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
for being overwhelmed.

856
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
So.

857
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
That's right. Well, you can.

858
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
He can. He just can't be overwhelmed at the same

859
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
time, right? You guys have to alternate.

860
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Yeah. Okay. That's true.

861
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
You'll be overwhelmed at my nighttime. I'll be

862
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
overwhelmed at your nighttime.

863
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
That's also a deal.

864
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And every project needs one sane

865
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
person. And that's you.

866
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You're the dedicated sane person on this

867
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
project. So. Deal.

868
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Do I get a badge? Maybe.

869
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
That would be great. We should come up with some swag.

870
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
That would be really nice for the people involved

871
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
with the website. We'll circle back to that idea.

872
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Well, okay. So we should

873
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
say if you'd like to participate, if you're listening

874
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
and want to get involved, we'll have links

875
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
in the show notes to the GitHub page.

876
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
There's also the J.B.

877
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
website matrix group where sort of the on the ground

878
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
chat is happening. Is there anything

879
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
else we should point people to that are

880
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
hearing and kind of getting curious, maybe want to participate?

881
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I think we did set up recently

882
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
a contributing

883
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
.md, a little bit

884
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
of documentation there. It's

885
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
a bunch of ideas collected. But if you're

886
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
new to the project and you're

887
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
thinking, oh, how is the best way

888
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
for me to approach getting

889
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
involved? We've tried to describe

890
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
it there. So that's a good place to start.

891
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Read that. It's not too long. If you have any questions,

892
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
please just ask me directly or ask

893
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
anywhere in a ticket or something and we're

894
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
happy to help. But that

895
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
is probably the best approach.

896
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
There you go. Stefan, thank you for joining us.

897
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
We really appreciate you being here and

898
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
all your hard work, obviously. Thank you.

899
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm going to take a moment and I'm going to thank Linode for

900
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
sponsoring Office Hours. They are

901
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
crazy enough to actually support the

902
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
shenanigans, if you can believe it.

903
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So let's go right now and say hello to Linode

904
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
together. Let's do it together. Linode.com

905
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and guess what?

906
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I got slash Jupiter. You did.

907
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
You got the whole planet? I got the

908
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
it's a big planet too, Brent. It sure is.

909
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah, it's true.

910
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You guys know this, but I'm going to tell you just in case

911
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
you didn't know this. You need to wise up.

912
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Linode is the best place to host your stuff.

913
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
For Linux geeks, for people that are speed hounds,

914
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
for people that want the absolute best

915
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
flexibility, the best dashboard,

916
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
the best support. Linode's model is

917
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
different than the hyperscalers. They work

918
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
on locking you in and then just selling you more

919
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and more services. Linode has a

920
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
very straightforward pricing structure that's

921
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
30 to 50% cheaper than the major cloud

922
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
providers that are out there. And you go

923
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
there, everything's right there. It's up front.

924
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You're not going to get any gotcha surprises on your

925
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
bill like you do with the hyperscalers. You know

926
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
what I'm talking about. I've accidentally

927
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
spent 300 bucks on the bosses credit

928
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
card once. I learned that one the hard way.

929
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Linode doesn't do that. And on top of all of

930
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
that, they've got great services like a powerful

931
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
DNS manager, S3

932
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
compatible object storage cloud

933
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
firewalls, physical servers if you need

934
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
it, database as a service service,

935
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
which is actually

936
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
really great. And then the other thing that's fantastic

937
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
is just their standard deployment on any

938
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
rig has all kinds of sensible defaults

939
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
for things like alerting about bandwidth

940
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
or storage. You can take snapshots, you can do automatic

941
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
backups, and it's all super

942
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
clear and easy to understand too.

943
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
If you guys can't tell, I'm

944
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
legitimately a big fan and I think you'll

945
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
love it too. And what puts it over the top is that

946
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
100 bucks, that's Linode coming in with the competence,

947
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
right? That's Linode coming in

948
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
saying with 100 bucks, you're actually going to

949
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
be able to try anything on our platform that you want

950
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
and you're going to be able to try it for a reasonable

951
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
amount of time to form an actual opinion.

952
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
That is that's what that 100 bucks is saying.

953
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
That's if you think about it, that's a

954
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
bold statement. They want you to try it and I think

955
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
you're going to love it. So head over to linode.com

956
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
slash Jupiter. Support this here

957
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
crazy office hours production and

958
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
you get yourself 100 bucks of machines.

959
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I mean, I don't know what you want to use it for. You could use it for storage.

960
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I suppose that's technically still using a machine.

961
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Linode dot com slash

962
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Jupiter.

963
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Brent, you got to go

964
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
get yourself over there right now because you know what?

965
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
That's where I got your node.

966
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Hey, I put I put a node

967
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
for Brent up on Linode. Why not? Right?

968
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Why not? We kind of just

969
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
use it for everything. Really?

970
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
But what don't we use it for? There are very

971
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
few projects that you come up with that

972
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
doesn't involve Linode, it seems.

973
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Like with the website, we're thinking about, OK, well, what makes sense

974
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
to store in the object storage

975
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
at Linode, right?

976
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
And it's just F3 compatible object storage.

977
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
So, I mean, you could run a minnow server on your own box

978
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
one day and run it there.

979
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I want to mention something.

980
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
I touched on this earlier, but

981
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
you made me think about it today. So it's your fault.

982
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You're welcome. You sent me a message saying

983
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
why are we getting so much spam?

984
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
What's going on?

985
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
And I would characterize. So

986
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
what we have is we have a Brent and I have a shared

987
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
office hours chat room.

988
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
And the emails that come into office hours

989
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
automatically get posted

990
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
in this chat room. So that way we can both see them.

991
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
And 95 percent

992
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
of what comes in to that

993
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
inbox is

994
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
garbage, scam,

995
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
marketing. It seems legitimate.

996
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Oh, they would pay us. They would

997
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
pay us. They would absolutely

998
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
pay us. You should see some of the stuff they would

999
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
pay us to do. And some of it's like

1000
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I read one. I just finally broke

1001
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
down and read one of these emails on Coder Radio this

1002
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
week.

1003
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
They want us to sneaky link like

1004
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
this is just one example. They want us to

1005
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
sneaky link to gambling websites

1006
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
and put posts on

1007
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
our page that encourage people to click

1008
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
on for real money gambling, as they put

1009
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
it. And then because they recognize

1010
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
this is like such a sketch

1011
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
business to be involved in, they're

1012
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
willing to pay us a premium to

1013
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
do it. They say this in the

1014
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
in the introduction email. Yeah, I read that

1015
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
one. That was pretty good.

1016
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
And

1017
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
they're all like this, right?

1018
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
So I want you guys to understand

1019
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
that this is a pervasive problem

1020
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
because Office Hours,

1021
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
it's not a big show, right?

1022
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It does all right. It does

1023
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
better than the average podcast, but it's not

1024
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
you know, it's not a big

1025
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
show. And we're getting

1026
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
a niche of a niche of a niche.

1027
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
It's a show we're making for people who like

1028
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Jupiter Broadcasting. We just basically

1029
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
don't give any F's. Although I am

1030
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
thinking about maybe changing the name. But anyways, I'll come back to that.

1031
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I like the name, but like so does everybody else

1032
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
every other podcast out there.

1033
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
But we're getting this kind of stuff

1034
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
as a small show. And

1035
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
so you can only imagine how it scales up if

1036
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
you've got any kind of reach and how the offers

1037
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
get more and more tempting if you have any

1038
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
kind of reach. And this

1039
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
in a nutshell is why nearly all tech

1040
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
media sucks. Not

1041
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
all of it. You know,

1042
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
there's definitely people out there

1043
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
that do it right. Some of our

1044
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
friends do it right.

1045
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
But in the Linux niche specifically, it's

1046
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
really, really bad.

1047
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
And

1048
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
this has a side effect

1049
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
of misinforming the community

1050
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
a lot. So there's a Linux project out there

1051
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
right now. In my opinion,

1052
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
based on research and background

1053
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
conversations I've had is like 90%

1054
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
hot air. But

1055
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
they really know

1056
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
how the tech press works.

1057
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
They know the big secret

1058
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
that I'm going to tell you about. They

1059
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
already know it because they've been around for a while.

1060
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
At least the person running it has.

1061
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
And the big secret in the tech

1062
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
press is that

1063
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
the reader or the listener

1064
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
or viewer, depending on what your medium

1065
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
is,

1066
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
the listener, the viewer, the reader,

1067
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
they are not the customer.

1068
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
When you go to like a ZDNet

1069
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
or an Ars Technico or a register,

1070
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
you're not the customer.

1071
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You guys all know this. You've heard it a million times.

1072
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
If you're not paying for it, you're the product.

1073
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
The tech

1074
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
industry is the customer, specifically

1075
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
the advertisers that exist

1076
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
in the tech industry. But you got to be friendly with

1077
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
the entire tech industry for those advertisers

1078
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
to be friendly with you because it's all

1079
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
about access.

1080
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
And as long as the Linux press and tech

1081
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
press in general make money via ads,

1082
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
they're just

1083
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
never going to serve the reader as the customer.

1084
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
It's their business model. It's not nefarious.

1085
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
It's not evil. It's the business

1086
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
model. It's simple as that.

1087
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
The reader is not the customer.

1088
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
The listener is not the customer. The viewer is not the customer.

1089
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's as simple as that.

1090
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I have been doing online media for

1091
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
15 years. I have been

1092
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
making it my primary way to make a

1093
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
living for nearly 13 of those 15

1094
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
years. So I have

1095
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
some standing here. I'm telling you,

1096
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
you're not the customer.

1097
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
It's unfortunate because

1098
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
what it means is that they're

1099
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
more inclined to print puff pieces

1100
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
about a project or a

1101
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
company that probably didn't really

1102
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
earn that coverage. They're less

1103
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
critical because they want to maintain

1104
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
their access. They want to maintain

1105
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
their network because they live

1106
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
and die on their access to information in these companies.

1107
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
And

1108
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
they just

1109
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
do business as a standard practice this

1110
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
way. They don't do it to deceive you.

1111
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
There's nothing evil about it.

1112
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
It's just the business model. And because

1113
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
paychecks depend on things working this way,

1114
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I don't think they think about it that much.

1115
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So you'll see nothing but puff

1116
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
articles for companies like Solar

1117
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Winds or Linux projects that are trying

1118
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
to break into the enterprise that really haven't delivered

1119
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
on anything yet.

1120
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
So this is why I go

1121
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
on all the time about membership

1122
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
programs and boosts.

1123
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Because membership programs

1124
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
and boosts

1125
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
keep Jupiter Broadcasting's audience

1126
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
the customer. And it's my job

1127
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I feel as the editor in chief of JB

1128
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
to make sure that the audience always

1129
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
remains our largest customer.

1130
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
So that's why I think boosts

1131
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
come in. That's where I think membership comes

1132
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
in. It gives you

1133
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
the confidence to know that the

1134
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
audience is our customer.

1135
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Now, of course, I

1136
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
know that the audience has to be

1137
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
the customer because that's ultimately

1138
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
who's going to hold us responsible.

1139
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I know that personally,

1140
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
but it matters that that's how the

1141
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
business sees things, too. Right. You understand

1142
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
like long term

1143
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
the way incentives work, it's necessary

1144
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
that the business also recognize

1145
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
the audience

1146
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
as the primary customer.

1147
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
So that's why I feel like boosts

1148
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
are really significant for podcasting

1149
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
because a lot of podcasters

1150
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
don't have the infrastructure or the numbers

1151
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
or the skill or the know-how

1152
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
how to do advertising. Thus

1153
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
that's not really an option for them. But even

1154
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
if they could get advertising, most of them

1155
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
don't know how to do it right. They don't know how to do

1156
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
the reads right. They don't know how to set up relationships

1157
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
right. They don't know how to build boundaries.

1158
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
It's very difficult. It's a very

1159
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
pervasive industry. It constantly

1160
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
is pushing on your on your

1161
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
on your line. And you have

1162
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
to have a skill set to push back to while

1163
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
maintaining a friendly relationship. It's

1164
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
a very hard thing to do. And

1165
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
with YouTube, that

1166
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
problem slightly alleviated by the monetization

1167
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
platform that YouTube offers. But the

1168
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
issue there is it incentivizes you to be a slave

1169
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
to an algorithm that makes

1170
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
content that's horrible right.

1171
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
But with Boost, there's no algorithm.

1172
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
There's no Google

1173
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
auction happening in the background to sell

1174
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
a mattress ad. It's

1175
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
the audience directly sending

1176
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
value to the podcast. And value

1177
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
for value is the only way

1178
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
to solve this problem at

1179
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
scale on the internet for small

1180
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
creators, large creators,

1181
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
for small free software projects, and

1182
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
big software projects. It is a

1183
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
fundamental shift in how

1184
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
the business, the project,

1185
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
the creators are incentivized.

1186
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
So,

1187
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
with that said,

1188
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
let's get into some of these Boosts.

1189
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Because we do have some great Boosts. I know that was a

1190
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
really big build up Brent, but I felt like it was important

1191
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
to get that out there because I think people might be

1192
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
missing the message and the noise

1193
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
with everything going on right now. And we do

1194
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
occasionally get people who, and we're

1195
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
listening, who challenge

1196
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
why we're doing Boosts,

1197
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
why we're dedicating

1198
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
such a large

1199
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
time slot in some of the shows

1200
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
for reading Boosts. And I think you

1201
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
mentioned something that I think is worth

1202
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
mentioning here, which is that

1203
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
often in the Boosts, some ideas

1204
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
and projects and like

1205
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
tools and things get

1206
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
mentioned that we would have never had

1207
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
a chance to talk about. And it gives us a little

1208
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
chance to just mention

1209
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
them quickly here and explore them

1210
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
and add to our

1211
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
toolbox, which is really amazing too.

1212
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
And share that in a really nice way.

1213
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
So I know it's had

1214
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
a ton of value for you, even just

1215
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
seeing the Boosts come in on a daily basis.

1216
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
But in terms of like a

1217
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,000
utility for us as well,

1218
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I mean, we've gotten a bunch of great tips

1219
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
from the Boosts. So thanks to everybody there.

1220
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah. And the other thing that they've been

1221
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
doing, which we didn't expect, is

1222
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
they've been keeping us on our toes about

1223
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
following up on items that we bring up on the show.

1224
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
The audience remembers and asks

1225
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
us about it. And we always have

1226
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
every intention of following up on stuff, but

1227
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
we just got a lot going on. We forget, you know, we're

1228
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
working on the next show. We forget what we talked about the week before.

1229
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
And the Boosts

1230
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
have been a great way to kind of keep those threads alive

1231
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
and interject questions or

1232
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
discussion or criticism

1233
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
that we wouldn't have otherwise brought into the show.

1234
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Right. So they're great from that standpoint

1235
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
as well. All right. Well, let's

1236
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
do it.

1237
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
And now it is time for

1238
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
the Boosts. So Gene

1239
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
boosted in seven days ago

1240
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
with a big old boost,

1241
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
30,000 SATs.

1242
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
He said, would a desktop OS

1243
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
on a powerful server setup in another

1244
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
room with maybe some

1245
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
sort of thing client in the office,

1246
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
would that work with horsepower

1247
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
combined with silence? You could

1248
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
do like the random desktopy things in

1249
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
VMs or LXC to keep it isolated from

1250
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
the production grade stuff. Rel or

1251
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Alma Linux nine and its super long

1252
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
lifestyle could provide you a stable, slow

1253
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
moving base for the system with

1254
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
things like OBS officially having flat back support.

1255
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
You could really probably load whatever is

1256
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
needed. And he says, P.S.

1257
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I updated my boost from 10,000

1258
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
SATs, which is about two dollars and 20 cents

1259
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
to 30,000 SATs, which is about six

1260
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
dollars and 60 cents to help

1261
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Brent with his travel fund. Oh,

1262
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
that's nice. I really like

1263
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
that. That is nice because we have some fun projects

1264
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
we want to work on. We want to get Brent down here before

1265
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
the September road trip and

1266
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
bang those things out. And so that is very helpful.

1267
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
We started a project list, which is

1268
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
always a dangerous thing for us.

1269
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I like the idea.

1270
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
I toyed

1271
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
around with something like this over the network

1272
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
years ago where I put a powerful box

1273
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
in one room and then just dumb

1274
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
clients throughout the house.

1275
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
It does work pretty well.

1276
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
I don't think it's the right setup here because there are

1277
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
times where we're actually physically needing to plug things

1278
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
and unplug things from the back of the boxes, especially

1279
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
with USB interfaces and cameras.

1280
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
What is

1281
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I'd love to do a project like that.

1282
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
I think that'd be so much fun. Awesome

1283
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Matt boosted in seven days ago with

1284
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
nine thousand five hundred

1285
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
and thirty eight.

1286
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I sent it in a couple of times

1287
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
so I just combined them just by putting

1288
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
some parts together. I came up with something that looks

1289
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
like this might fit your needs. He's talking about our replacement

1290
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
OBS rig. Relatively

1291
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
small and quiet fifth gen Ryzen

1292
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
for under nine hundred dollars.

1293
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,000
It has Intel Wi-Fi so everything should be compatible.

1294
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,000
And of course you could just

1295
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
tweak it based on your needs. And what

1296
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
what awesome Matt did is he

1297
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
included a PC part builder link.

1298
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
So so great. It's like all the

1299
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
parts right here. It's actually a

1300
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
it's a kick butt box. It comes out

1301
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
at like nine hundred and sixty bucks

1302
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
but seeing this makes

1303
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
me feel like yeah we probably could. We probably

1304
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
would be OK with a DIY

1305
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
PC again. In the back of my mind

1306
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I was like a failure would be awesome

1307
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
under nine hundred and sixty bucks.

1308
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
That's a hard price to beat these days.

1309
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I know you bought the current one I think

1310
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
with some of your Bitcoin back in the day.

1311
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Do you remember what it was sort of equivalent

1312
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
worth back then. I think they were

1313
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
all the machines we bought were right. And we bought

1314
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
like identical machines. I think they were all

1315
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
like right around eight nine hundred bucks.

1316
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
They were kind of in that price range.

1317
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
One of them I think we put extra disk

1318
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
in so that was slightly more expensive.

1319
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
But yeah I was looking back at it.

1320
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
It was a cheap time to buy machines

1321
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
compared to some of the prices.

1322
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,000
So double boost from Awesome

1323
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Matt. One thousand

1324
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
five hundred and sixty nine sats and just says

1325
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
love you all too. They mentioned he's awesome

1326
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
because he is awesome. Of course it's

1327
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
it's in the name I suppose.

1328
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
We got a boost from Delian

1329
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
seven days ago three thousand five

1330
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
hundred sats or Dylan I suppose Dylan

1331
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
and I really appreciated

1332
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
the discussion about podcast production.

1333
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I've been making my own show casually for a

1334
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
few years to a small audience

1335
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
and I recently switched to value for value.

1336
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Question what are you using for

1337
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
soundboard during the boost segment?

1338
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
It's a good question.

1339
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
So we've used a couple of different apps

1340
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
over the years. There is

1341
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Sound Ducks D U X for

1342
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Linux which I like a lot. And then on the Mac

1343
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Fargo F

1344
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
A R

1345
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
R G O I think.

1346
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
F A R

1347
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
R A G O I think.

1348
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
And that's a pretty good app for the Mac as well.

1349
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
And I think you'll either

1350
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
way you go you'll like it. Just don't go crazy like

1351
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I do. It'll drive people crazy.

1352
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
I think also part what he's asking here

1353
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
is where'd you get the clips that you're using.

1354
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
Oh you think so.

1355
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
I think maybe. I would

1356
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I would be asking that as a follow up anyways.

1357
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Well here you go. I'm asking as a follow up.

1358
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Those you know it

1359
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
depends. Like sometimes I see a boost

1360
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
come in and I'm inspired to go grab a

1361
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
soundboard bite for that boost right

1362
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
then and there and I just have to track it down.

1363
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Some of them came from

1364
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
the podcast index guys they have like

1365
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
on their GitHub they have like a bunch

1366
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
of boost sound clips you can

1367
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,000
use. And then others are just ones I've collected

1368
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
over the years. I mean I have

1369
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I don't know something

1370
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,000
like 40 different soundboards. There's one

1371
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
you grabbed recently from

1372
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
I think it was like a show you're watching or

1373
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
a news piece and it's my favorite

1374
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
so far. Can you give us a taste.

1375
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Coming in hot with the boost.

1376
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I love that

1377
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
one. Yeah I got that news report.

1378
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Yeah.

1379
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
It wasn't a news report

1380
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
it was a YouTube car channel.

1381
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
That's what it was. And it was this

1382
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
super broken down dilapidated

1383
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
car that they had jacked up

1384
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
and put a massive engine in with

1385
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
the intakes out of the hood and everything like that.

1386
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,000
So it's just this junker

1387
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
this total junker. I don't know something

1388
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
about it I love though. I can't help it.

1389
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
We got a double boost from Dilan

1390
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
3500

1391
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
500 sats double boost tell me if I'm

1392
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
crazy but I previously produced my show using

1393
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
mumble with multitrack recording output

1394
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
and then painstakingly edited the resulting

1395
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,000
tracks in Audacity.

1396
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Now I just record live and

1397
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I edit nothing similar to a twitch or really

1398
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
a video on demand stream. My

1399
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
co-hosts are in a jitzy me room recording and streaming

1400
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
at the same time with OBS using my desktop

1401
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
PC running mangero smart

1402
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
move or reckless.

1403
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I like

1404
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
this. This might be a series that

1405
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
is a good that is a good series.

1406
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
You know I always like going a little reckless. I always

1407
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
do. It keeps it fun

1408
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
and you don't want it to get

1409
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
boring. I think

1410
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
you went overboard. I think I think where

1411
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
you went wrong Dilan in the past is you went

1412
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
overboard like we have a mumble room here right now.

1413
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Hey mumble room. Hi guys. Hello.

1414
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Hey hey. Hey they're hanging

1415
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
out with us. They get a low latency open stream

1416
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
but we have never done the individual

1417
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
track recording simply

1418
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
because of the work overhead right. Each

1419
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
number in the mumble room

1420
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
would become a track. And so

1421
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
if you've got four

1422
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
twenty thirty people in there that's

1423
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
four twenty thirty tracks. That's crazy.

1424
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
So we do mix the mumble down

1425
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
to a single track but then

1426
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
each one of our individual hosts is

1427
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
also their own individual track.

1428
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Ultimately

1429
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
you can make it sound

1430
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
significantly better. There's just no

1431
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
if ands or buts about it. Brent's voice

1432
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
is different than my voice

1433
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
and our voices and just the way we're recorded

1434
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
are different in the mumble room. And

1435
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
so each one of them needs their own EQ

1436
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
needs their own touch with the compressor.

1437
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
It needs its own pass over.

1438
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Each one has its own unique background noise.

1439
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So really you do need to process

1440
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
them separately for really really great audio.

1441
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
That being said

1442
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
go check out Jupiter tube.

1443
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Tell me what you think and then go compare

1444
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
it to the release version

1445
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,000
of this show. Office Hours 8

1446
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
will come out on Friday once Drew is done

1447
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
with it. And you can compare Office Hours 8

1448
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
to the PeerTube release

1449
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
and you can kind of get an idea of what

1450
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
the difference between live to tape is versus

1451
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
fully edited.

1452
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And I think you'll agree the fully edited is going to

1453
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
sound better. It's going to be better paced.

1454
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
It's going to be a little more refined.

1455
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
The fully you know live mix

1456
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
version isn't necessarily unwatchable or un-listenable.

1457
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
So it's just kind of depending on your

1458
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
on your audience too. And then lastly

1459
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
what is sustainable for you.

1460
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Like none of it really matters if the other

1461
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
way was just burning you out and you weren't

1462
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
going to be able to keep it going and now you've found a way where

1463
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
you can keep it going and so the show goes on.

1464
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Like ultimately that's what really matters right.

1465
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
So I don't think it's reckless.

1466
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I think if that is the case then I think it was

1467
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
probably a smart move. But don't be

1468
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
afraid to experiment and feel free to use

1469
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
our show this very episode as an A B

1470
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
because I think that'd be a good little test.

1471
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Get a sense.

1472
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Our first row of ducks comes in this week from

1473
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
The Golden Dragon as always.

1474
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
I'm a duck. D-U-K Duck.

1475
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And he's got a question

1476
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
to you with 2,222

1477
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
sets. Brent what

1478
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
strategies did you use to learn coding

1479
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
and what have you like say

1480
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
when learning Hugo and what have you

1481
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
learned. I'm trying to learn some dev

1482
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
stuff and I'm looking for strategies to start

1483
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
coding. Side note

1484
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
I love that I'm basically

1485
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
following the journey of The Golden

1486
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Dragon and his learning

1487
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
development skills across multiple shows

1488
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
as he boosts into like Coder and Office Hours.

1489
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I feel like I'm learning more about him every time.

1490
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
So what have you found

1491
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
useful Brent when you're trying to pick all this stuff up

1492
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,000
and you've been trying to pick it up quick too.

1493
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,000
The question was posed in past tense.

1494
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,000
What strategies did you

1495
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
learn you know did you use

1496
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
to learn coding. And I think actually I'm

1497
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
probably

1498
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
more likely in the same

1499
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,000
bolt as The Golden Dragon is

1500
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
I'm just on the very tip of learning.

1501
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
So I think the number

1502
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
one thing for me was

1503
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,000
and I learned this from Tim Ferriss

1504
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
of all people is the concept of

1505
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
being very careful

1506
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
what you learn.

1507
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
It's more important to learn the right thing than

1508
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
it is to learn a bunch of wrong stuff.

1509
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
If you want to learn Python for instance there's

1510
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
about like a hundred thousand videos on YouTube

1511
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
about learning Python which is

1512
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
actually not that helpful

1513
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
and it's too bad

1514
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
that there are so many I gotta

1515
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
say. So I before

1516
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,000
even diving into any of it

1517
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
just looked at

1518
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I guess

1519
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
trying to determine who had quality

1520
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
and recency and who was

1521
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
getting down to like the very essentials

1522
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
of what someone needs to learn

1523
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
at first instead of just like

1524
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
here's how to do all the things and I don't really

1525
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
know if it's the best way or it's the

1526
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,000
the right way to learn

1527
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,000
it quickly. Be very discerning

1528
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I guess is all of that boiled

1529
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
down to a few words. And so there's

1530
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
one gentleman I think his

1531
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
YouTube channel is HeckWithTim.

1532
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I think he works at

1533
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Microsoft working on

1534
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I forget now but one of their projects.

1535
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
He is super

1536
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
no fluff

1537
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
but very complete in his explanations

1538
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
and it's

1539
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
like okay here's everything you need

1540
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
to know for like stage one

1541
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
compressed into like a thirty

1542
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
minute video with chapters

1543
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
which is such a helpful thing when you're trying

1544
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
to learn it's like oh I'm trying to learn about

1545
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
you know Python's

1546
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
functions. Well maybe

1547
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
you gotta listen to it three or four times.

1548
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
So that's what I would say. Number one

1549
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
be super discerning about where you

1550
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
learn. So my first

1551
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
research part

1552
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
was like where are people learning

1553
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
successfully because I don't

1554
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
want to go learn somewhere unsuccessfully. It's a total

1555
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
waste of my time. I have like a hundred

1556
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
other things I want to be doing

1557
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,000
and so that was super important to me.

1558
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
The other thing is like try to find

1559
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,000
some folks that you know or in the community

1560
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
the JB community even just to recommend some

1561
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
things like some of the back channel

1562
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
conversations I've had with Wes

1563
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
have been fascinating. So I've been like

1564
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,000
oh Wes I'm just kind of like learning this thing but I'm

1565
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
struggling a little bit. Do you have any like tips or tricks?

1566
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
He's like yeah here's four

1567
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,000
other things you could look at

1568
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
that are like progressions in your

1569
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
learning. So having like a

1570
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
soft mentor like that is actually

1571
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
super nice too.

1572
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So those are two things I think

1573
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I would recommend very strongly

1574
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
is careful where you learn

1575
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
and go find someone who can

1576
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
really give you those shortcuts.

1577
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I think you just did.

1578
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
I think you just did that.

1579
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
There you go. Very good.

1580
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Cospeelin boosted in

1581
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
seven days ago with 3690

1582
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
sats.

1583
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Boost. Whoa. This is

1584
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
the first Office Hours I've ever listened to.

1585
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
There's a lot more in this show than I thought.

1586
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I'd like to make a joke though and I'd like

1587
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
to say this show sounds like

1588
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
a podcasting 2.1-RC1

1589
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
boardroom which he thinks is

1590
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,000
great. A note about the ads

1591
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
he says I don't mind it when the podcast

1592
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
inserts the ads but the dynamic ads

1593
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,000
no good. Thanks for the show.

1594
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
We totally are following

1595
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I mean we don't follow nearly the podcasting

1596
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
2.0 development stuff that obviously

1597
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
the podcasting 2.0 show does. I mean how

1598
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
could we? But I

1599
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
feel like we're giving it a

1600
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
bit of coverage from a boots

1601
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
on the ground podcaster who is

1602
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
trying to figure out how to implement this stuff

1603
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
into his business and

1604
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I kind of look at it as

1605
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
a competitive advantage as well like

1606
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
you know not like it's a bad

1607
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
competitive but if we can if our shows can have

1608
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
more features that give you things

1609
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
like chapters and transcripts and more host

1610
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
information and higher higher

1611
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,000
context and all that kind of stuff that's great

1612
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
right. Why wouldn't we want that stuff and I've

1613
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
always kind of wanted to have the premium

1614
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
feature set for our shows. So

1615
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,000
I'm following the podcasting

1616
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,000
2.0 stuff from kind of that perspective

1617
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
and recognizing

1618
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
the shortcomings in the podcast

1619
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
industry recognizing the opportunities

1620
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
we've missed with mobile

1621
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
apps and the opportunities that

1622
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
we've missed by constantly

1623
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,000
constantly encouraging people

1624
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
to do things outside the podcast app

1625
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
which has been detrimental to our growth

1626
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
in the long term and all that stuff

1627
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
and so I follow it for that purpose and the guys

1628
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
invited me on the podcasting 2.0 show

1629
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
this week so they will

1630
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
they'll have an episode out on Friday when we do

1631
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
and go check that out if all

1632
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
things go as planned I'll be on

1633
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
that this week's episode.

1634
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
So I'll share some of my thoughts there.

1635
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Next cause Optimus Gray

1636
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
boosts in with

1637
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
a real doozy six

1638
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,000
days ago with twenty two

1639
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
thousand two hundred

1640
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,000
and twenty two sats. How

1641
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
about that for a row of ducks. Thank

1642
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,000
you very much and here's something

1643
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
for your trouble.

1644
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
That's a big old granddaddy duck.

1645
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
He says

1646
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
for us Jupiter party members

1647
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,000
can I ask for possibly a new

1648
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,000
feed. If the lightning and boost support

1649
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
is going to take a while could

1650
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
we have a separate feed of just the bonus

1651
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
content like the

1652
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
you know the post show for self hosted

1653
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
the coderly and

1654
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
the non the non like live

1655
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
stuff that goes out into the member feeds.

1656
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So then we could subscribe to the normal

1657
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,000
feeds and boost like we always do but then

1658
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
also still get to enjoy the bonus content.

1659
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Hope to see you all at the West Coast meetup.

1660
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
That's a good idea. No that's interesting

1661
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
just a bonus content feed

1662
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
so you can subscribe to all the regular feeds

1663
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
and then just have one feed. It's just the

1664
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
special stuff we create for the members. How did I

1665
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
never think of that before. We might actually be able to do that quickly.

1666
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I got to figure out the plumbing

1667
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
but that seems like

1668
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
something I should have thought of. So

1669
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
thanks Optimus.

1670
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Those ducks are powerful.

1671
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Those are good

1672
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
ducks. Dave Jones our

1673
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
buddy Dave Jones speaking of podcasting 2.0

1674
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
boosted in two days ago with

1675
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
two thousand one hundred and twelve

1676
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
sats. B O O S T

1677
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
He says Alex Gates is the real deal. He's the

1678
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
smartest developer I ever met. Shout out to

1679
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Alex. He was on the show

1680
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
last week and

1681
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,000
that's

1682
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I say high praise from Dave.

1683
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
High praise from Dave there Alex. That's pretty

1684
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
good. Oh a guy one boosted

1685
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
in seven days ago.

1686
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Yes I am still listening because

1687
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
we took time off. I thought

1688
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I thought maybe nobody was listening anymore. You know

1689
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I thought I don't know the new

1690
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
show relatively small show

1691
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
goes off off the

1692
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
air for almost a month. I thought nobody's

1693
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
listening anymore but oh a guy

1694
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
was and then we got a double boost from oh a guy

1695
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
seven days ago

1696
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
two hundred and twenty two sats baby ducks

1697
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
double boost. I've seen a variety of

1698
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
duck like boxes with AMD Ryzen

1699
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
APU's. I feel like there's something

1700
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
in there for an OBS machine maybe

1701
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
something you're looking for. I think he's right

1702
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
interesting. Those would be well

1703
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
they're not fanless or are they fanless.

1704
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
I'm always

1705
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
looking for fanless but why do you think

1706
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
they're not. I don't think the ducks are

1707
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
they might be quiet but if they were super

1708
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
quiet. Yeah

1709
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
that'd be fine. Bird

1710
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
dad zero two thirty four boosted with four

1711
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
hundred and twenty sats

1712
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
coming in hot with the boosts in

1713
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
regards to a bulletproof peer tube setup

1714
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
maybe build a beefy server and have

1715
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
it be the main aggregator of all the streams using

1716
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
something like teleport recent stream

1717
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
restream or NDI.

1718
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
That way the endpoints

1719
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
are flexible and the final output is only an appliance

1720
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
you need to worry about who

1721
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
says he'll send in more feedback

1722
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
via email with more

1723
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
deets. Well that's

1724
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
that's pretty great. That's pretty great

1725
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
and then speaking again

1726
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
of podcasting to know the pod father

1727
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Adam Curry boosts in with ten

1728
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
thousand sats

1729
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
and

1730
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
this is a little bit of brilliance. This

1731
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
we got to take a moment

1732
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
to make space in the show

1733
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
because what the pod father has realized

1734
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I think is genius. He says

1735
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Spotify is the shit

1736
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
coin of podcasting and

1737
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I think he's right because

1738
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
it's hot Spotify highly

1739
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
decentralized implementing

1740
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
proprietary standards

1741
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
going to build and build

1742
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
i.e. pump and pump and pump

1743
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
until they realize there's

1744
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
nothing really behind it. There's no

1745
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
money to be had here and then it will

1746
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
pop and collapse down to

1747
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
some like really crappy product where

1748
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
is Bitcoin decentralized.

1749
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
There is no central

1750
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
authority. There's no Satoshi Nakamoto anymore.

1751
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
He's gone. It's an open protocol.

1752
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's been online for 13

1753
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
years widely distributed all over the internet

1754
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
completely decentralized tens

1755
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
of thousands of nodes.

1756
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I think he's right.

1757
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
It's the open standard. I love it

1758
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
that right there is some genius.

1759
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
That's what that was pod father. I was

1760
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
what I saw that I'm like that's brilliant.

1761
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
That's so brilliant. All right.

1762
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
We got another baller boost and this one

1763
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
was a moment for me. This

1764
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
one came from someone who I

1765
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
hear on other podcasts boosting all the time.

1766
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
So it was special because

1767
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
I feel a real community

1768
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
is building here in the boosts

1769
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
and we're watching it happen across multiple shows

1770
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
the dreb Scott boosted

1771
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
in three days ago with 33

1772
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
thousand three hundred and thirty

1773
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
three sats

1774
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I'm a duck D.U.K.

1775
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
loaded with talent. I'm giving that

1776
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
a special duck status too. I don't know why but I feel

1777
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
like it. He said I heard about you guys while listening

1778
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
to podcasting to know and Dave mentioned

1779
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
you guys interviewed Alex Gates.

1780
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I came over to hear Alex and ended up subscribing

1781
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
enjoy the show.

1782
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
You know what you get a special boost

1783
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
boost. There you go.

1784
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I believe that's a Fletcher special dreb Scott.

1785
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Thank you. I was nice. I felt like

1786
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
I just got boosted from a boosting celebrity

1787
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
over there. I got you know I was like a little like

1788
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
dreb Scott boosted the show.

1789
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Nice. It's funny like

1790
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
it's a really neat community because I listen to

1791
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
other podcasts and I hear these individuals

1792
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
boosting in and dreb helps with

1793
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
podcasting to those chapters.

1794
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
He helps do their community chapters. So great.

1795
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Our last big boost

1796
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
of the week came in from this is a great name

1797
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Lord of Bytes three days

1798
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
ago twenty thousand four hundred

1799
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
and eighty sats coming in

1800
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
with the moves. First of all let

1801
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
me say you're the best podcast group out there.

1802
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
I've been trying to get into Linux for ten

1803
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
years. Every time I start to play with Linux

1804
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I lose interest in a couple of months.

1805
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
It wasn't until I found you all

1806
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
that I really started getting into Linux

1807
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
your shows in the community keep me inspired

1808
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
every day to learn something new in Linux.

1809
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I also love that I'm getting involved

1810
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
in my first open source project helping out with the new

1811
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
website. Keep up the amazing

1812
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
work. Yeah I was just going to say Lord of Bytes

1813
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
have been sharing a whole bunch of

1814
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
great insights and stuff and working hard.

1815
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
So thank you.

1816
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
We love you. Value for value in multiple

1817
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
ways there Lord of Bytes. Thank you.

1818
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
How incredible. Really

1819
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
good to see.

1820
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Oh

1821
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
bring a tear to my eye. And then

1822
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
we do have a couple of thank you boosts

1823
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
that I wanted to get out there. We got five hundred

1824
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
sats from Al Carney pointed out

1825
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
that you know maybe the Linux Foundation being on

1826
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Spotify not so bad. Maybe it'll

1827
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
bring in new listeners and new users to

1828
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Linux. I remain skeptical

1829
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
but that was their boost.

1830
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Four hundred fifty sats from a listener

1831
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
letting us know. Yeah I am

1832
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
still out here too. And then thirty

1833
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
thirty sats. That's right.

1834
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Three thousand thirty sats from Marcel

1835
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
another V4V legend says he's still

1836
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
listening. Thanks for the show.

1837
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
And he liked our fake mattress ad.

1838
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
That's great. That is great.

1839
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I want to say thank you to the Mumble Room for joining

1840
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
us live. You guys

1841
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
are fantastic. We chat a lot in the pre and post show.

1842
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Maybe you know what we ought to do

1843
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
like an open Q&A episode.

1844
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Get some questions ahead of time

1845
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
let the Mumble Room ask questions

1846
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
because that's part of the idea of office hours is

1847
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
people might want to know what's going on

1848
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
have input something like that. So maybe

1849
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
we plan to do that in the next episode if I remember.

1850
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
So get your Mumble client ready

1851
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
because you can pop in you can ask us questions

1852
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
or get clarifications. We have

1853
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
details at Linux Unplugged dot com slash

1854
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Mumble. We'll probably eventually have a Mumble page

1855
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
on the new Web site. Right. It's

1856
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
on my personal to do list.

1857
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Someone asked me today they're like are you working on

1858
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
this. Should I work on this or are you

1859
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
working on this. Like no no. Soon

1860
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
soon. That'll be great.

1861
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Meanwhile you're going to be hanging out

1862
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
there at Alex's pad watching the

1863
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
place for him while he gets ready for the

1864
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
London meetup on the 5th at 6 p.m.

1865
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
local time. That's that's getting really

1866
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
close. Mm hmm.

1867
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Yeah man. And then we have

1868
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
a big batch of

1869
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
West Coast meetups. The Times

1870
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
and like the general

1871
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
vicinity's are now all posted at

1872
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
meetup dot com slash Jupiter broadcasting

1873
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
then we're going to ultimately end up a

1874
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
JPL. By the time we do the next

1875
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
episode we should have the form

1876
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
available. We're going to do an audience lottery we'll

1877
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
have. I think what we're going to do is a next

1878
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
cloud form that you can fill out and then we'll

1879
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
use a tool to randomize the results.

1880
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
We'll pull a list of primary

1881
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
winners and secondary winners so that way if people

1882
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
know show we have backup list we can call on and

1883
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
stuff like that. We'll have details

1884
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
on the GPL lottery

1885
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
soon. We're just trying to

1886
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
figure out a fair way to do it so that way we can get

1887
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
about you know

1888
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
15 JB 20

1889
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
JB community members inside

1890
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

1891
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
for a very special tour from

1892
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Tim Canum the operations

1893
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
lead I believe of the Mars

1894
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Linux Copter at JPL.

1895
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Very excited about that. And on the

1896
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
way down to JPL and

1897
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
on the way back up we'll

1898
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
be doing multiple meetups

1899
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
and all the details are at meetup dot com

1900
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
slash Jupiter broadcasting.

1901
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Up first those that London meetup then

1902
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
the West Coast tours will be coming up.

1903
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
I think that's everything Brett.

1904
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
You feel like that's everything. That's a pretty good show.

1905
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
I think. Yeah. Yes we should say

1906
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
if you'd like this if you'd like to send a boost in

1907
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
you could go to new podcast apps dot com

1908
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
and I've been loving Fountain. I'll put

1909
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
my referral link in the show notes.

1910
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I don't know if it gets me anything anymore

1911
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
but it might make it so

1912
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
you can follow me and then see the clips I publish.

1913
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes for Fountain.

1914
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Podverse is really great too.

1915
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
And you're going to see that embedded on our

1916
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
new website very soon. Very excited about that.

1917
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
And then of course there's a whole bunch

1918
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
of apps like Boost CLI

1919
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Breeze so you don't if you

1920
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
don't want to switch podcast apps that's all at new podcast

1921
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
apps dot com. You can send a boost in that

1922
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
way. You can send us an email if you go to

1923
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
office hours dot hair we have a contact form

1924
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
over there. We also have

1925
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
our RSS feed so you can subscribe

1926
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
and then we do the show live

1927
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
on Tuesdays at noon

1928
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern over at

1929
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Jupiter dot tube. We publish on Fridays

1930
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
but we do the show live on Tuesdays

1931
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
every fortnight. Right.

1932
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Not every Tuesday but every fortnight. Thank you.

1933
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Every fortnight. It's just Jupiter

1934
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
dot tube for all that stuff where you can

1935
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
also watch the archive. We have a calendar.

1936
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
It is on the calendar. You're right. Jupiter broadcasting

1937
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
dot com slash calendar. We've got a calendar

1938
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
on the new site too right. It's just the same

1939
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
thing. So far it's just the same

1940
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
thing. It works. It's not beautiful

1941
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
but it works. You know what's funny is

1942
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Stephen was going to join us

1943
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
here for this office hours and he and I

1944
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
were like sitting there trying to figure out

1945
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
like time zones. He's like when's the show

1946
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
live. I was like you're in like I think

1947
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
plus 10 from my time zone

1948
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
but I'm in a different time zone now and

1949
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
JB is one behind my usual. So

1950
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I was trying to do all the math and then we

1951
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
were like oh wait we have a calendar

1952
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
for this.

1953
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I forget it too. I forget it too.

1954
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
But it does convert to your local time zone.

1955
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
I mean we invested millions of dollars

1956
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
in those time zone robots.

1957
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
That's the AI that we have in our site.

1958
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And if you haven't caught

1959
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
Brent's recent brunches

1960
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
they are now posted at extras.show

1961
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Some great conversations

1962
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
over there. So go check those out.

1963
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Alright that's everything.

1964
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Get out of here. It's my

1965
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
office. You're just visiting.

1966
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
I appreciate you but you gotta

1967
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
go. Thanks for coming. See you

1968
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
next time.

1969
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Bye bye.
