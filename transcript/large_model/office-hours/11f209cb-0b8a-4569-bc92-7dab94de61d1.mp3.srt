1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
So I hope it doesn't distract you,

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,700
but the hair is a little off today.

3
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,300
I washed it this morning,

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,420
but it was one of the quickest showers

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,380
I've probably had in years.

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,220
I feel like there might be a story here,

7
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,520
or is that just a new Chris?

8
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,420
No, okay, so you wanna know how you can tell a guy's busy?

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,400
When a disaster happens,

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,300
and it's like a week and a half later,

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,940
and he still hasn't gotten to it yet,

12
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,620
and it's like, no, that's on my list.

13
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,420
It's so funny when people hit me up with stuff.

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,100
I'm like, yeah, no, I'll totally get to it.

15
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,140
And they have no concept

16
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,580
of what my to-do list looks like.

17
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,700
Crazy, just crazy.

18
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,820
About a week and a half ago, Brent,

19
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,700
in the town the studio was at,

20
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,540
a water main just exploded,

21
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,340
and the entire roadway became a river.

22
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,580
It was halfway up to trucks deep.

23
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,520
It was seriously deep,

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,480
and it just gushed for hours and hours and hours.

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,160
Well, I picked the wrong time

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,500
to do a load of dishes or something,

27
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,380
because they had to shut off all of the water

28
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,360
to the entire town.

29
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,380
So it's just no water.

30
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,140
And so I'm like, all right, well, screw this,

31
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,980
I'm outta here.

32
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,400
And I took off, and I left, right?

33
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,600
Because, you know, a guy's gotta have water.

34
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:16,100
I get back the next day, early in the morning,

35
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,120
and the water is still turned off.

36
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,600
I'm like, oh, geez, this is really bad.

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,620
And it's also just extremely hot.

38
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,100
So, you know, people wanna water their gardens

39
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,100
and all that kind of stuff, and we've got no water.

40
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,460
And it doesn't even dawn on me

41
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,740
that I had done a load of dishes,

42
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,140
and that I have drained the hot water tank.

43
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,380
Oh, no, I see where this is going.

44
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,380
But there's been no, I assume, right, at this point,

45
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,060
there's been no water to refill the hot water tank.

46
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,660
And so it just ran on empty, I guess,

47
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:45,060
and it burned itself out.

48
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,980
And this is about a week and a half ago.

49
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,340
And I just, today I got out there

50
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,980
to look at the air lights that are flashing on it.

51
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,140
It's like this Honeywell controller

52
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,640
with seven blinking lights.

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,980
So I look up seven blinking lights, right,

54
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,660
for the controller, you know?

55
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,540
That doesn't seem like a normal operating status.

56
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,580
No, trying to conjure the best Google results possible.

57
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,460
And, of course, what I get is turn off the gas

58
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,960
and call a technician.

59
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,140
So I did the right thing, and I just left the gas on,

60
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,980
and I just keep hoping the water heats up.

61
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,940
Oh, my goodness.

62
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,220
I've got time to deal with that.

63
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,460
You know what's extra funny about that, Chris?

64
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,860
Which I feel bad about your situation,

65
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,820
because yeah, that's a totally,

66
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,960
you did the perfect thing to burn that thing out.

67
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,920
So I think the solution is clear.

68
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,580
You need some new elements or something.

69
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,520
But the hilarious part is that for about a week and a half,

70
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,540
I too, here at Alex's, have been having hot water issues.

71
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,540
And his system here is one of those on-demand systems.

72
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,260
And so it gets this blinking like error 12.

73
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,740
And you look at error 12, you know,

74
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,100
and it's a no flame error.

75
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,020
So I've been for like days trying to diagnose this thing.

76
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,160
I had the whole thing apart,

77
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,540
like things unplugged and like all sorts of stuff.

78
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,220
And so Alex was like, you know what?

79
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,040
It's not worth your time.

80
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,260
I'll just call a technician.

81
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,140
It's totally fine.

82
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,420
And it has been since last Tuesday,

83
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:19,100
which is about, well, that's exactly a week

84
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,740
since we've been trying to coordinate a technician

85
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:23,560
just to show up.

86
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,380
Twice they were scheduled and never showed up.

87
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,500
And I, oh, you know that feeling.

88
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,140
And it just gets me going.

89
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,700
And I, anyways, I just got a message

90
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,660
as we're recording here.

91
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,180
Apparently Alex has set up something else.

92
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,940
Third time's a charm, right?

93
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,180
Oh man, so we're both taking cold showers this week.

94
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,140
That's what you're saying?

95
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,460
Oh, this morning shower.

96
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,260
Yeah, I think I'm a little better than you

97
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,020
in that I get about, if I reset the thing,

98
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,860
I get about six and a half minutes of hot water

99
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,360
before it starts erroring out.

100
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,540
So I've got these showers timed now.

101
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,020
Oh yeah, you could do a shower in six and a half minutes.

102
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,740
I'm doing this shower in three minutes,

103
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,460
so you could do that.

104
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,620
That's why I'm half shaven,

105
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,780
so that I don't have to spend extra minutes.

106
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,580
It's Office Hours with me, Chris.

107
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,860
Hello everybody, welcome on into the office.

108
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,500
We are getting ourselves prepared

109
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,300
best we can with sponge baths this week

110
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,300
because we got lots to talks about.

111
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,780
You know what, Brent?

112
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,620
Come on in, get in here.

113
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,620
Come on, you smell great, by the way.

114
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,460
You smell great.

115
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,500
Hello, hello.

116
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,820
Oh, good, yeah, we'll smell great together.

117
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,780
That's great, thanks.

118
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,300
It's been a rough week.

119
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,940
It's been a real rough week.

120
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,340
This is a drinking episode.

121
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,980
I should have brought a drink with me.

122
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,420
I had a drink before this show,

123
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,180
but I should have brought one in here

124
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,100
so I could get proper sauce for this episode.

125
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,660
By sauce, do you mean hydrated, right?

126
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,500
No.

127
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,020
Oh, okay, okay, okay, got it, clear.

128
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,300
No, I mean barely, barely able to speak.

129
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,980
A sure sign that it's gonna be a bad week

130
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,700
is if you see something missing from an RSS feed,

131
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,420
if a webpage doesn't load,

132
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,580
you know, it's an inconvenience for you

133
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,940
because you wanna listen to your podcast,

134
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,780
but for me, it's like a crisis, you know?

135
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,100
And it's just, we had service provider outages

136
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,580
totally outside our control,

137
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,020
and then we had some of the tools

138
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,100
that we've built over the years fail us a little bit,

139
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,340
and the two things just kind of came together

140
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:24,060
at different times to just make it a really stressful week.

141
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,400
And it's a bummer because everybody works so hard,

142
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,340
so when the systems fail, you feel like it extra hurts

143
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,020
because you hit your mark, everybody did their thing,

144
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,260
everybody contributed their piece.

145
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,340
We did everything in the right order on time,

146
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,060
which is, you know, it's a thing when you're,

147
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,300
you know, you got a weekly cadence.

148
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,380
It's a well-oiled machine, I will say, from week to week.

149
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,020
And so it's an accomplishment

150
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,420
when we all hit our mark every single time,

151
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,300
every single week, and we do it for years on end.

152
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,820
Every time we do it, I'm proud of the entire team,

153
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,260
you know, and we have this little Slack channel

154
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,340
that we have that when the automation system

155
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,580
publishes an episode, it lands in there

156
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,900
as like this episode has now gone out,

157
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,780
and every single time, I think, you know,

158
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,420
this is such a great team, and they've worked really hard.

159
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,220
And then a component fails,

160
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,020
and it's like no matter how well everyone executed

161
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,780
in the entire chain, it didn't matter

162
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,260
because it still didn't go out, right?

163
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,060
It's like, it's just, it's the worst feeling in the world.

164
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,060
Outages happen, and so this week,

165
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,060
I wanted to talk a little bit about early decisions

166
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,820
people make when they're building their stack

167
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,220
that just influence the way things run for years after.

168
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:39,180
And also, I wanted to talk a little bit about

169
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,140
where we draw the line on what we self-host

170
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,740
versus what we decide to let somebody else host,

171
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,740
what we automate versus what we do manually,

172
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,940
because whenever there's an outage like this

173
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,800
that's both in the hosting end and in the tooling end,

174
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,020
this is something I reflect on,

175
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,460
and I just wanted to share that with you guys

176
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,340
while it's still fresh and raw a little bit.

177
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,740
But before we get there, I think you and I need to talk

178
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,920
a little positive stuff, a little community stuff,

179
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:10,900
because this morning, you messaged me on a show day

180
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,420
asking me to elevate your privileges on the Meetup site

181
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,900
so that way you could do something with the Meetups.

182
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,820
I have no idea what.

183
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,060
I just took your word for it and gave you the rights.

184
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,420
I didn't even ask you what you're doing.

185
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,620
I know when to ask, so you just go, yep, done.

186
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,780
Whatever you need, whatever you need.

187
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,460
Well done then, sir.

188
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,620
So what's going on?

189
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,660
I know we have the London Meetup

190
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,300
just the day after this episode posts publicly,

191
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,780
and I know you're also kinda doing some low-key stuff

192
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,180
over there in Raleigh, so update us.

193
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,740
Give me something good.

194
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,980
Give me something to be happy about.

195
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,020
Well, it occurred to me as I was looking at the calendar

196
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,620
that I have been here a little while and I'm leaving soon,

197
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,980
and it was always my intention

198
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,540
to do a little tiny micro Meetup.

199
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,060
I didn't wanna create a big, huge thing

200
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,820
and take away from the Meetups like the London Meetup

201
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,820
because it's happening about the same time.

202
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,980
So I thought a great way to connect with people

203
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,100
would be to create a little matrix room

204
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,500
in our matrix server dedicated to Raleigh, the environment,

205
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,420
because I remember when we had the Meetup here,

206
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,100
we were really impressed at how wonderful everybody was

207
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,820
and everybody was like exchanging phone numbers and email

208
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,460
and all the other probably more modern technologies

209
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,500
to stay connected.

210
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,180
And we thought, hey, wouldn't it be great

211
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,060
if we create a permanent space where everyone who's here

212
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,260
and everyone who couldn't make it but is in the area

213
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,300
could stay in contact?

214
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,340
And it occurred to me that that might,

215
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,940
my excuse to wanna hang out with some of these people

216
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,260
on this trip would be a great way to kick that off.

217
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,860
So you mentioned giving me elevated privileges

218
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,140
to meetup.com.

219
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,780
All I did was I sent a message out to everyone

220
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:48,860
who attended the last Meetup here in Raleigh

221
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,860
and invited them to join our matrix room.

222
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,180
Get a little something going.

223
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,020
Get a little something going.

224
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:58,460
So I did notice like a minute and a half

225
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,740
after I sent that message out, people started streaming in.

226
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,340
So I think it's working.

227
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,980
I haven't quite checked out on it recently,

228
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,100
but I think we're doing all right.

229
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,820
So my end goal for this week, of course,

230
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,980
Office Hours is coming out on Friday.

231
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,300
So if you're listening to this,

232
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,420
you're gonna have to really speed yourself up.

233
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,500
But I'm hoping to have a little tiny,

234
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,900
maybe a restaurant meetup this weekend.

235
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,260
I'm open to hearing what people suggest

236
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,220
and we'll see what happens.

237
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,140
And I'll report back when it happens.

238
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,220
When we create these new matrix rooms,

239
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,100
and I know it can be hard to keep track of,

240
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,340
we have what's called a space, a Jupiter broadcasting space.

241
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,700
It's a directory of all of these rooms.

242
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,460
So when we make a new Raleigh meetup space

243
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,900
or the West Coast crew meetup space,

244
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,980
we are putting these in a space

245
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,780
where you can just look at that one space.

246
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,820
I'll put a link in the show notes if I remember.

247
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,660
Help me remember, Brent.

248
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,100
Sure.

249
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,020
And once you look at that space,

250
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,260
it's a directory of all these different rooms.

251
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:58,820
And we were talking on the stream before we started the show,

252
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,180
Brent and I, and I know Wes and Alex feel the same way,

253
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,380
are of the opinion that Raleigh is an area

254
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,220
of the United States that Jupiter Broadcasting

255
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,020
wants to invest in, just from like a community standpoint.

256
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,340
Because, I mean, we had nearly 200 people

257
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,500
at the meetup when we went there.

258
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,580
There were people from all areas of the tech industry.

259
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,180
So we got a really broad representation

260
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,060
of both the free software side of the industry

261
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,700
and also the commercial side of the industry.

262
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,140
And it just felt like an area that was worth going back to.

263
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,380
So this Raleigh room that we've created

264
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,980
is kind of like what we're doing with the London meetup.

265
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,980
Alex is going out there, he's the tip of the spear,

266
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,420
he's gonna kind of create a community over there.

267
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,900
He's gonna kind of create the pathways

268
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,220
for organizing a meetup over there.

269
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,540
And then that's something that if it's successful,

270
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,940
we can build upon, and we can do more of down the road.

271
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,220
And it's my intention, although who knows,

272
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,540
I am a dad of three young children,

273
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,700
and travel is crazy right now,

274
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,380
but it's my intention over time to do more

275
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,220
of this kind of stuff,

276
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,580
to do more going to places where industry is

277
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,180
and going to places where listeners are

278
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,540
because we have some really well-connected,

279
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,520
really informed listeners that are deep into this stuff.

280
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,420
And I can gain a lot of knowledge and experience from that

281
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,020
that I can share with the rest of the audience

282
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,540
that we can put on the air.

283
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,660
And so it's something that we wanna continue to do.

284
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,060
And I think Raleigh is gonna be

285
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,780
one of our key areas going forward.

286
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,480
So if you're out there, join the room.

287
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,780
We'll put a link in there in the show notes at

288
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,020
officehours.hair slash nine.

289
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,300
And then you can find the link in there and join up.

290
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,660
And even if it's after you've heard this,

291
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,660
maybe you're hearing this a little bit

292
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,180
after Brent's in town, we'll be back.

293
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,420
Yeah, the idea is for the room to be a long-term thing.

294
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,580
So if you've missed me, don't worry,

295
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,020
I'll be back at some point.

296
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,880
But the idea is to also just enable you all to connect

297
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,820
while we're not there as well.

298
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,620
So use the room freely, it's yours, it's a gift.

299
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,220
I do have a few stats for you, Chris.

300
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,540
So I think I made that room maybe two hours ago,

301
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,740
three hours ago, and there are already 10 people in there.

302
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,800
So that's something, I mean, you and I are in there,

303
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,900
so maybe that doesn't quite count.

304
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:09,900
But also I wanted to compare,

305
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,680
we had such a great success out here in Raleigh.

306
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,060
And on the meetup page, I did notice that there were about

307
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,500
just slightly over a hundred people who RSVP'd to that.

308
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,700
And I'd noticed that for the London meetup,

309
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:24,220
we're at like 116.

310
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,460
So I think Alex might have to keep that in mind

311
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,380
when he's organizing last minute for the London meetup.

312
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,100
I think it's gonna be a huge success.

313
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,420
Yeah, you and I know that 116 means 200.

314
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

315
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,320
It's funny, it's funny, right?

316
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Because like 60 will mean 40 and over 100 means 200.

317
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,560
It's just the way these things work, it's the strangest thing.

318
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,460
But that's definitely something I've learned over the years.

319
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,900
Good, I think he's gonna have a blast.

320
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,020
Me too, I'm feeling pretty jealous over here.

321
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:58,700
I hope he gets so charged up for like another year

322
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,540
of self-hosted podcasts, because I know you and I

323
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,260
get super charged up from these events.

324
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,580
He also made those new stickers he brought with him,

325
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,500
so we'll see how the feedback goes with that.

326
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,260
Oh boy, I hope it goes smooth.

327
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,300
By the time this comes out,

328
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,220
it's just gonna be absolutely days away.

329
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,660
I have so many things I could talk to you about,

330
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,220
but I wanted to talk about this outage

331
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,900
that we had Monday night.

332
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,640
Earlier this week, every single show page was down.

333
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,400
Every single show page.

334
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,780
Every show, every site.

335
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,300
That's why we have our own website now.

336
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,820
Oh wait, we didn't do that yet.

337
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,900
Not yet, not yet.

338
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,860
Yeah, we're working on it, we're working on it.

339
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,780
And I wanna say before I get into this too far,

340
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:43,140
Fireside FM has been a really good service

341
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,180
and it's totally worth the money, even with the outages.

342
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,260
And Dan Benjamin has built a good team over there,

343
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,460
but I've been a Fireside customer

344
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,700
since nearly the beginning.

345
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,980
And a lot of our friends in the Linux podcasting space

346
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,540
noticed and have also started using Fireside.

347
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,020
So I think we've brought a lot of business to Fireside too.

348
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,720
And I would also, although I don't know,

349
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,420
well I guess I do know, I have been emailed,

350
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,700
I've been told by Fireside that we are on the higher end

351
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,780
of amount of downloads that the service gets.

352
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,060
And as a result, for some of our shows,

353
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,540
we pay a very, very high special rate

354
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,120
that isn't publicly listed anywhere on Fireside's page.

355
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,180
But if you get, this is not a humble brag,

356
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,020
it's just the reality.

357
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,220
If you get as many downloads as we do,

358
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,820
you end up getting a note that you gotta pay

359
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,420
or you gotta go.

360
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,740
And so we pay a rate that is beyond what is listed

361
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,220
on the Fireside service.

362
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,620
And for years I felt like I really got what I paid for,

363
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,820
even at the elevated rate.

364
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,020
But now I'm not so sure.

365
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,740
If you look at Fireside's public Twitter page,

366
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,420
I don't think they've even tweeted for a couple of months.

367
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,260
There's features that we have been waiting on,

368
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,900
like network support, podcast network support,

369
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:01,780
since before our acquisition by Linux Academy,

370
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,640
we were making internal plans to adapt.

371
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,620
And now here we are,

372
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,460
almost three years independent post-acquisition,

373
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,840
and the features still haven't shipped.

374
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,820
I mean, it's just one of those things, right?

375
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,680
Maybe we're the only one asking for it.

376
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,900
I don't know, man.

377
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't know.

378
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,300
I think perhaps the attention is focused elsewhere.

379
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,540
Podcasting 2.0 has been a thing,

380
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,260
and initially Fireside was really great.

381
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,500
They've done good chapter support.

382
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,740
They have hosts and guest support in the namespace spec,

383
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,420
which is nice so that way in the show notes

384
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,340
you can see who the hosts of the show are,

385
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,420
who the guests are.

386
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,500
That's part of the podcasting 2.0 spec,

387
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,460
and Fireside supports that, and I am grateful for that.

388
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,360
But the live tag, the social tag, the value tag,

389
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,580
nothing from Fireside.

390
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,280
It's been a couple of years and nothing.

391
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,900
And I've also had situations

392
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,620
where an episode was just totally dead, couldn't download,

393
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,260
and we could see that the page

394
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,700
had been rendered several times,

395
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,240
and by the third time it had been rendered

396
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,060
by the Fireside servers, the download link didn't work.

397
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,020
And I captured that, I documented it,

398
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,240
I submitted it to them in a ticket.

399
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,900
They got back to me two or three days later,

400
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,560
might have been even more than that,

401
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,540
and said, I don't see an issue, hope everything's okay.

402
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,020
Three days of your show being unavailable

403
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,100
to download is killer.

404
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,260
Ultimately we nuked the post, we recreated the post,

405
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,080
and everything worked.

406
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,660
But there's just been weird issues like that.

407
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,460
And so the question that comes up

408
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,020
from the technically savvy audience is,

409
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,220
well guys, why don't you just host this yourself?

410
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,220
Yeah, I know what goes into that question.

411
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,500
It seems like a relatively easy one to ask

412
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,740
and a hard one to answer.

413
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,280
Yeah, and so I thought we'd talk a little bit about that.

414
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,780
And those things do change with time.

415
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,580
There's a post that I'll have linked in the show notes

416
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,260
that I thought was actually pretty wise.

417
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,620
It's called The Disproportionate Influence

418
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,660
of Early Tech Decisions.

419
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,780
The author has a pretty long post,

420
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,180
I'll just give you a couple of highlights here.

421
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,740
He starts, spend five years at a hyper-growth startup

422
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,220
like Stripe, but you could put anything in there.

423
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,300
Any internet-based business I'd say,

424
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,700
even Jupiter Broadcasting.

425
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,420
And you see a lot of changes during that time.

426
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,140
Organizationally it's night and day, that's true for us.

427
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,100
We've gone from big teams, small teams, one person team,

428
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,120
part of a big multi-hundred person company

429
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,280
back to a small team.

430
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,100
Big organizational changes, night and day changes.

431
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,140
We've scaled from a few people to thousands of people,

432
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,780
and the structure has adapted to those teams

433
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,900
and those responsibilities come along.

434
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,980
That's true for JB too, 100% true.

435
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,860
And you look at all of this malleability

436
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,020
in the corporate structure and in the team structure,

437
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,660
and one thing that doesn't change as quickly

438
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,420
is the tech that we've built all of this on.

439
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:52,420
In fact, even as part of the Linux Academy acquisition,

440
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,040
the core foundation of what made the JB Podcasts available,

441
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,100
what our website ran on, the services that we used,

442
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,380
all of that stuff, that didn't change infrastructure.

443
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,540
That tech didn't change.

444
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,240
Like culturally and organizationally,

445
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,380
things were changing like crazy,

446
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,420
but those tech decisions we made years ago,

447
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,740
they stayed, Fireside remained through all of that, right?

448
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,420
Those were all choices we made before Linux Academy,

449
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,920
and even though there is a drive in those organizations

450
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,340
to standardize, standardize, standardize,

451
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,660
you don't tend to really change those early tech decisions.

452
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,180
You're just constantly building around them

453
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,940
because you gotta keep moving forward.

454
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,120
The author writes, a common theme in all of these companies,

455
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,700
we all knew that these were imperfect implementations

456
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,060
even when they were originally added.

457
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,820
They were added anyway in the name of velocity

458
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,580
with implicit assumptions baked in

459
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,260
that they'd be shored up and improved later

460
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,420
when there were more resources and slack time to do so.

461
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,880
And although they certainly were shored up,

462
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,700
they were never improved by all that much.

463
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:59,100
Another common theme is that they have lived far longer

464
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,300
than their progenitors would have ever expected.

465
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:06,260
As it turned out, that slack time is chronically

466
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:10,520
a vanishing rare luxury in an engineering organization,

467
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,180
and software is always hard to change

468
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,380
once it's firmly cemented in place.

469
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,640
Doesn't that ring true?

470
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,340
Yeah, it made me think, Wes has been a darling

471
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,500
and he's been posting all of his discoveries

472
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,020
as he's trying to solve some of these problems.

473
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,620
It's like a play-by-play.

474
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,020
And there's some stuff in there that even you were like,

475
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,740
oh, I don't think we need that part anymore.

476
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,280
That's been there for a while.

477
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,140
And there's some, I don't know,

478
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,540
generational stuff in there that just lives on.

479
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,180
Yeah, and in a lot of ways, it's like,

480
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,820
as long as it works, you just keep moving forward.

481
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,540
After the Linux Academy acquisition,

482
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,620
we took a pass at automating certain tasks.

483
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,180
And I wanna talk to you guys about this a little bit,

484
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,100
and then we'll circle back to all of this.

485
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,020
I think there's two school of thoughts.

486
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:58,620
One is you do everything by hand.

487
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,000
And I like this school of thought, I get it.

488
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,340
It's artisan in a way, right?

489
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,220
Everything is handcrafted.

490
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,780
You record the show, you edit the show,

491
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,100
you post the show, you do all of that yourself.

492
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,300
You make the WordPress post,

493
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,920
you create the RSS feed entries,

494
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,540
you post it manually in all the different destinations,

495
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,740
all the different sites.

496
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,340
You manually render out each piece.

497
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,000
You do every single step.

498
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,580
Maybe you got a checklist, maybe you just intuitively know it.

499
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,720
You just do all of it.

500
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,660
And there's a lot that I find appealing there.

501
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,020
From a creative standpoint, it's ultimate control.

502
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,140
It's beautiful.

503
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,320
It's like everything is exactly how I intended.

504
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,640
It's ultimate control.

505
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,180
But it doesn't scale.

506
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,980
There's a critical scaling issue there, right?

507
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,120
It's a one person thing.

508
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,360
And anything that you wanna maintain for years,

509
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,980
and I've been doing this for 15 years,

510
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,100
anything you wanna maintain,

511
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,820
something like that just gets so tedious

512
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,800
that eventually you begin to actually hate the task.

513
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,460
You resent having to do the task.

514
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,700
And when we were acquired by Linux Academy

515
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,220
and we brought on a bunch of the team members as full time,

516
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,820
I was like 12, 13 years into every single episode,

517
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,300
I create a WordPress post, I create an RSS feed,

518
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:22,120
I do all of it manually, and I was just done.

519
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,020
I couldn't do another one.

520
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,060
Like it just, I had reached a wall.

521
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,940
And I was pushing through it because it had to get done.

522
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,680
But by doing so, I was building a resentment.

523
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,660
And that's when I realized long term,

524
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,500
you gotta automate some of this stuff.

525
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,840
And while that seems like a great idea on the surface,

526
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,220
you give up some of the things

527
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,660
about that handcrafted artisan control.

528
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,840
You give up that I touch every single step.

529
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,960
There's a good side and a bad side to that.

530
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,500
The bad side is you lose that handcrafted touch

531
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,340
for everything.

532
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,620
The good side is you don't screw it up as much.

533
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:09,860
Because if you can do it with automation,

534
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,780
you can do it over and over and over again

535
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,580
exactly like it should be done,

536
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,400
with a level of perfection that a human doing the task

537
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,380
just simply can't.

538
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,060
And you get scalability, and you get standardization,

539
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,780
and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

540
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,860
So we automated a lot of these things.

541
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,180
But every now and then, that system breaks down.

542
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,340
And it kinda makes you rethink this entire philosophy.

543
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,020
And that's where we were at this last week.

544
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,660
I think, Brent, in part, we realized,

545
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,340
okay, we need to tweak this, we need to tweak this.

546
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,900
But where I'm at now is it doesn't mean

547
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
that automating the rendering of the shows

548
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,180
and automating the posts and automating the creation

549
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,820
of the RSS feeds, I don't think that is a bad idea.

550
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,460
I think it just, occasionally, it needs refinement

551
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,020
as we make changes.

552
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,380
And it also means that sometimes we make mistakes,

553
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,900
and those mistakes go out, like we had several shows

554
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,540
that just didn't post to the all show feeds.

555
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,460
They're like ripple mistakes, right?

556
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,620
Yeah, that's the downside, right?

557
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,460
And there's parallels with Ansible here, don't you think?

558
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,680
Ooh, that is interesting.

559
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,420
Yeah, I think one thing I like about Ansible, for instance,

560
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,420
is that someone else could go in and read the stuff.

561
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,220
But the whole time you've been just talking,

562
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,940
it has reminded me in both instances,

563
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:26,840
both the artisan creator does everything instance,

564
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,700
but also this automation instance.

565
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,700
One thing we've run up against a few times

566
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,500
is that typically one person is the knowledge keeper

567
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,620
of how it's built or how it works

568
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,740
or how to solve the problems for the edge cases.

569
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,740
And that's what I'm interested in tackling.

570
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,420
It's like, how do we fix that part of it?

571
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,900
And it sort of feels like that was a decision we made

572
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,020
for velocity purposes, right?

573
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,420
That was a technical decision we made a few years ago

574
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:00,620
for velocity's sake that today we're like, oh.

575
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:03,660
And it's not even fair to them, so I agree.

576
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,320
There is probably some areas we could tweak there too.

577
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,860
But I also feel like those lessons we've learned as a team,

578
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,060
we've applied to the website.

579
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,340
You and I, just before the show started,

580
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,780
we were talking about a fix that needed to be made.

581
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,460
And the sequence of events is gamma put in the poll request,

582
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,220
you made the change, I commented on the need.

583
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,260
That's true.

584
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,960
It's gone from like one person can do it, right,

585
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,460
to now like all of us are involved.

586
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,400
And so I think we are applying that lesson

587
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,580
to the future stuff we're building,

588
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,180
to the stuff we're building today,

589
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,020
which is good because I think that's the only way

590
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,580
we can scale.

591
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,700
But there's something inspiring about this website project.

592
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,860
It's bringing the community together

593
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,240
in a way that's like better than ever before.

594
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,700
Like we're really building something awesome here.

595
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,400
Like the stuff that's being built,

596
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,620
another podcaster could absolutely take

597
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:56,220
and build a system where they are their own infrastructure.

598
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,820
As long as they're comfortable using Hugo,

599
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,800
there's something out here.

600
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,140
I love that, right?

601
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,180
It's like I feel like even though we do make mistakes

602
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,120
and we are living with some technical debt,

603
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,760
it does feel like we are absorbing the lessons from it.

604
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,600
You agree?

605
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,420
I do.

606
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,980
I think it's a path.

607
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,580
It's gonna take a little while to get to.

608
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,460
For instance, the RSS is like the thing

609
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,320
we're both most careful about changing

610
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,220
and also perhaps needs changing the most.

611
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,060
Yeah.

612
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,180
So it's like a tricky balance there.

613
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,780
And so anybody listening to this,

614
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,080
their initial question would be,

615
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,520
well, why don't you just get the new website to do the RSS?

616
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,740
And what would you say to that?

617
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,180
Well, that was the, that was like,

618
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,220
everyone's like, yeah, we'll just have the new,

619
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,340
yeah, oh, you gotta get the fixed fees.

620
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,640
We'll just have, yeah, we'll have the,

621
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,660
yeah, Hugo can do it.

622
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:46,660
And funny, like 15 years ago when I launched all this,

623
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,640
guess what I had generate the RSS feeds?

624
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,080
The website.

625
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,020
Of course.

626
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,860
Right?

627
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,700
Yeah.

628
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,860
It's a natural thing you do, right?

629
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,020
You make a website post,

630
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,460
you might as well have that be the RSS thing.

631
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,620
And then I don't have to make a bunch of posts.

632
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,060
Like it just seems obvious.

633
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,540
But then there's millions of reasons.

634
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,860
You realize later that you have to do custom feeds.

635
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,220
People want multiple different types of feeds.

636
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,020
Video feed, this, you know, you got MP3 feeds.

637
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,380
Back then we also had MP4 feeds.

638
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,220
You got member feeds.

639
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,180
You got ad free feeds.

640
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,200
You got live stream feeds.

641
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,680
You got, yeah, all show feeds.

642
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,460
You got, it's just, there's a lot.

643
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,020
What have we done to ourselves?

644
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,580
And there's a lot of mix and match there.

645
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,160
And then of course there's new features we want to add.

646
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,100
And a lot of these platforms

647
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,940
that auto generate the feeds for you,

648
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,100
take years to get those new features.

649
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,940
Years.

650
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,300
And well, we want to be out ahead of everybody.

651
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,740
We don't want to be launching that stuff

652
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,100
at the same time everybody else is.

653
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,220
How boring is that?

654
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,100
Right.

655
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,660
For a podcast, the RSS feed, it's our radio signal.

656
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,720
That is our signal.

657
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,740
The RSS feed matters so much, right?

658
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,320
Because that's what powers all the podcast players.

659
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,780
Once you're subscribed, it's the RSS feed that matters.

660
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,260
So we got to have complete control over that.

661
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,300
And we got to do it the right way.

662
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,820
And right now we're looking at a system

663
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,000
where we generate the feed using automation

664
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,860
because I don't want to mess it up.

665
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:08,140
I know I will get it right 90% of the time,

666
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,540
maybe even 95% of the time.

667
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:15,420
And I know this because before like three years ago,

668
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,260
we were manually generating all our RSS feeds.

669
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,580
We used to manually generate all of the feeds.

670
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,140
After I decided the website couldn't handle anymore,

671
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,620
I had to move over to manually generating them.

672
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,460
And for the most part, I got it right.

673
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,620
And there was very few issues, but there were issues.

674
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,900
And when you have a problem with RSS,

675
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,220
it's like there's no going back

676
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,440
because it gets cached everywhere.

677
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,300
Podcast players, they save it locally.

678
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,780
They download stuff.

679
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,380
You don't know like how they're going to handle

680
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,100
a new entry in the feed to replace a file.

681
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,940
They all do it differently.

682
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,660
It's like, there's no going back.

683
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:52,180
And so we decided to switch to hosted RSS feed generation

684
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,380
with Fireside because it's pretty flawless,

685
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,140
but it just doesn't have the features we want anymore.

686
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,180
So now we want to do it right.

687
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,620
We got to, and you got to host it right

688
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,140
because it's a file that gets slammed all the time

689
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:05,300
as everybody's, you know, you got hundreds of thousands

690
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,500
of podcast catchers out there checking an XML file

691
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,980
and they're checking it all the time.

692
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,980
Oh man.

693
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,200
So you really got to build that in a clever way

694
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,420
where it's cached appropriately,

695
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,780
but it's not done in such a way

696
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,420
that prevents you from doing quick updates

697
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,140
if there's a mistake or you're going live

698
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,980
and you want to announce that it's very complicated.

699
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,780
It's one of the more complicated things we have to do,

700
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,660
but we'll solve it.

701
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,060
And that's why the website can't be responsible

702
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,140
for generating the RSS feed.

703
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:34,940
I mean, that is like 10% of the reason why the RSS,

704
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,620
why the website can't, it's not even like,

705
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,340
that's not even, that's not even the rest of it.

706
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,060
It's just 10% of the reason, yeah.

707
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,260
But it's something you got to figure out as time goes on.

708
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,940
The website project is going really well though, Brent,

709
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,180
and you want to give us a brief update

710
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,380
and maybe like your best case scenario for going live

711
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,780
and maybe your worst case scenario for it going live?

712
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,820
Ooh, okay.

713
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:57,860
There's a lot here.

714
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,460
I have been having a ton of fun,

715
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,620
as we mentioned the last office hours, with the website,

716
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,860
but not the website itself,

717
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,540
because I actually haven't been that involved

718
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,900
with the code itself.

719
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,100
It seems like I don't even need to do that.

720
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,340
But I've been just organizing some of the tasks

721
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,020
and helping organize people.

722
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,900
But my favorite part has been the little community

723
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,780
that we've built around this website.

724
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,980
It's like, you know, we have a matrix room dedicated to it.

725
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,820
Everybody in there has been amazing and hilarious as well.

726
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,660
And it's been super fun just to be a part of that.

727
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,620
I've heard repeatedly from people that have said,

728
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,380
oh, this is finally such a great way

729
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,020
for me to give back to JB.

730
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,300
And I can't always do it monetarily,

731
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,700
but I can do it with, you know,

732
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,780
commits to the repos, for instance.

733
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,660
We have, I think I tallied it recently.

734
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:54,660
We've got like 20 authors now who've submitted commits.

735
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:57,060
And there's over 200 commits to the repo.

736
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,580
And I think that's kind of an amazing thing.

737
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,260
So I think that's been going really amazingly well.

738
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,500
I think better than we could have even imagined.

739
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,740
And it's been smooth, no issues.

740
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,500
Everybody's been working really well

741
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,180
and in an organized fashion.

742
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,540
So like, there are no duplicates of effort

743
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:17,580
and somebody's work is not being thrown out

744
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,100
because, you know, we had already solved that problem

745
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,900
a week ago, for instance.

746
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,740
So it's been actually working surprisingly well.

747
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:27,300
I've been very, very pleased.

748
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,580
And I wanna just put out a big thanks

749
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,020
to everyone who's gotten involved.

750
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,700
And if you wanna get involved, there's still time.

751
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,380
Cause we have, I've put out what I'm gonna call

752
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,900
a soft deadline for us to go live in just about two weeks.

753
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,980
So that's August 15 ish.

754
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,780
And that is strategic because our real deadline

755
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,820
is not for another two weeks, but forget I just said that.

756
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,820
Because really we wanna get it live as soon as possible.

757
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,260
I was going through the number of tickets

758
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,740
for our first milestone this morning

759
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,220
and we're doing pretty good.

760
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,580
I think we can get through it.

761
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,660
So with a little bit more effort

762
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,780
and a little bit of concentrated, you know, time,

763
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,580
I think we can totally get there.

764
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,220
So my best case scenario, I'm gonna put this out there,

765
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,380
is two weeks from now.

766
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,900
So on the 15th of August,

767
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,700
our worst case scenario would be like rushing at the deadline

768
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:24,380
and I think Chris, if you haven't like misled us,

769
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,020
I think the deadline is the end of the month, so.

770
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,660
Yeah, and I think the sooner the better

771
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:34,220
because you and myself and the JB backend team,

772
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,220
we need to turn our focus to the road trip

773
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,060
as soon as possible.

774
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,460
So that- Oh yeah, bad project.

775
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,900
Right, so there's that issue too.

776
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,420
And then of course we don't wanna be problem solving

777
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,620
during the road trip.

778
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:50,620
Yeah, so I would say one thing you could do right away

779
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,780
for those listening,

780
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,620
one thing you could do right away

781
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,100
is go to jupiterbroadcasting.net.

782
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,700
If all you do is go there and play for five minutes

783
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,660
and try to break the thing

784
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,060
and then let someone know how you broke it if you did,

785
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,980
that would be wonderful.

786
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,140
Or if there's some feature you would love,

787
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,980
if there's some, you know, thing missing maybe

788
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,060
or even something that you think

789
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,500
is a really great implementation, we'd love to hear it.

790
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,700
So the best way to give that feedback,

791
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,300
if it's an issue that you think, you know,

792
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,300
should be recorded and someone needs to fix,

793
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,740
GitHub would be the best place for that.

794
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,660
But if it's just some comments,

795
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,780
join the Jupiter website group on Matrix.

796
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,620
We'll have a link to that

797
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,940
and just send in your feedback there.

798
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,860
But yeah, fuzzy testing is really what we need

799
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,700
at this point.

800
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,780
It's exciting.

801
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,700
If we make your optimistic deadline,

802
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,620
I mean, even if we're around it,

803
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,020
I think this will be the most impressive community project

804
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,740
that JB's ever done.

805
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,580
Don't you think?

806
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,420
I really do.

807
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,740
I think it might already be, you know.

808
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,540
I think what's wonderful, and this is very selfish of me,

809
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,740
but what's wonderful is I could just get up in the morning

810
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,420
and sit at my computer with my coffee.

811
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,540
Well, it's not really coffee, it's usually tea.

812
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,660
And just like dream up the features I want on the website

813
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,100
and I just like, you know, type them away.

814
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:10,780
And then, so sometimes I do do this till like 2 a.m.

815
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,540
in the morning and I wake up the next morning

816
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,820
and someone's already implemented the features.

817
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,860
It's like the most fabulous thing.

818
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,140
And I gotta say, like, that's such a cool thing

819
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,700
that we're building, you know, in open source fashion

820
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,980
and people are really excited to get involved, so.

821
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,980
And what a great demonstration of value for value

822
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,020
while we're talking,

823
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,940
while this has been our conversation recently.

824
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,020
Well said.

825
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,620
Another example of the type of value for value contribution

826
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:38,620
that will pay dividends for years for us, years.

827
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,180
And I hope we end up with things a lot more up to date

828
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,500
and current on this new website.

829
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,060
Like when we start up the stream for office hours

830
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,380
on Tuesdays, every other Tuesday,

831
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,420
jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar for your local time,

832
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,940
we like, we'll tell people like join our mumble room, right?

833
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,620
And get in the matrix chat room.

834
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,780
And to do that, go to this website

835
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,940
to get these instructions and to do the other thing,

836
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:03,780
go to this other place to get these other instructions.

837
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,460
And it's just, and then not only that,

838
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,940
but like the instructions aren't even necessarily current

839
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,260
over at that other website.

840
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,740
It's embarrassing.

841
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,300
It's very embarrassing.

842
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,020
It's like the kind of thing, like when you do it,

843
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,900
it's all great.

844
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,700
But like two years later, it's out of date.

845
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,300
And what I love about what the new website offers us

846
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,380
is because of this GitHub workflow,

847
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,380
if an audience member notices something,

848
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,780
A, they can just open up an issue,

849
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,780
but B, a lot of us can just contribute to that page,

850
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,340
update that page on GitHub, save it,

851
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,460
and then a GitHub action will render it out

852
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,180
on the actual JB website and update

853
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,620
like the matrix information page or the mumble page.

854
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,740
It's amazing.

855
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,660
Huge for us.

856
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:47,460
I think that's actually my favorite feature

857
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,740
about all of this.

858
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,660
I've sort of given it to myself to accomplish,

859
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,460
oh, the mumble page, I think it was the matrix page

860
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,740
is out of date since we moved servers.

861
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,700
And we, nobody went and changed that.

862
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,420
So on the new website, there was a ticket

863
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:04,500
that I put in there eons ago to update that information.

864
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,100
And nobody was working on it

865
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,580
because I had self-assigned myself.

866
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,940
And then I wasn't even working on it,

867
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,660
which is mildly embarrassing.

868
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:12,100
But a day or two ago, I was like, okay,

869
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,940
someone else take this.

870
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:14,140
I'm not doing a very good job,

871
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,500
but I think I've described it enough

872
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,940
that it's pretty clear what needs to happen.

873
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,780
And what ended up happening was someone very quickly

874
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,300
just grabbed it up and said, oh yeah, I could work on that.

875
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,500
And they came out with a version of the tutorial

876
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,100
for how to subscribe to our matrix servers.

877
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:33,220
That was like far better than what I envisioned

878
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,940
and could have come up with.

879
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,580
It made me realize that maybe the best people

880
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:42,540
to be making the pages to serve the listeners

881
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,340
are the listeners because they're the audience

882
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,460
who has to take in this information.

883
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,660
There was just a moment there where I went,

884
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,540
oh man, this is such a great thing we're building.

885
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,460
And the best thing is that listeners

886
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,620
can get directly involved

887
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,340
and implement the features they want as well.

888
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,220
That's such a great insight.

889
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,060
Like who would know better

890
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,020
than the people using it themselves?

891
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,220
That's not us.

892
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,060
That's not how we interact with this.

893
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,420
Like if we want to listen to a show,

894
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,100
I mean, a lot of times I will actually just go to the website

895
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,020
and I'll listen to a show.

896
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,060
But also like I've got the flack files,

897
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,140
like it just, I don't interface with any of this

898
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,500
the same way the audience does.

899
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,020
Well, and I think there are a variety of different people

900
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,580
who interact with our, let's call them services, right?

901
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,140
Like you and I interact with them,

902
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,260
but in a certain way we have a certain perspective.

903
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,900
But there are new listeners,

904
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,820
there are listeners who've been with us for a decade.

905
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,780
There are listeners who are experts

906
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:38,740
at implementing matrix or are brand new to matrix.

907
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,740
And both of those perspectives need to be sort of heard

908
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,980
in implementing these features.

909
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,580
So I think we've tripped on a good thing here.

910
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,620
Yeah, and there's people that are noticing stuff

911
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:52,220
that like would never be on my radar.

912
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,580
Like this is one that I love

913
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,860
that you mentioned, you opened up here,

914
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:00,740
making the host and the guest page layout identical.

915
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:05,580
Of course they should be just from a UI standpoint

916
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:10,580
or Team Linux 01 created an issue to integrate IPFS.

917
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,180
I am absolutely on board with supporting IPFS,

918
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,860
but I just don't have the time or really the passion

919
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,940
to build those features in.

920
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,300
But I'm totally on board with JB supporting that.

921
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,860
Yeah, there've been a few blue sky ideas

922
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,620
that have been thrown into this list.

923
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,620
And I think it's wonderful

924
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,580
because we can capture them while they're still fresh.

925
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,220
And maybe we won't get to them in this next month

926
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,300
for this first version of the website,

927
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,500
but that's completely fine

928
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,780
because as long I think as we record them there,

929
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,140
like there's another one I see there,

930
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,300
light and dark theme switching.

931
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,540
We've always just defaulted to dark themes for JB stuff

932
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,100
because I think we're serving ourselves.

933
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,740
But a switch would be, I think,

934
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,380
not the hardest thing to implement

935
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,140
and would be really great for just usability for everybody.

936
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,500
So that's another idea that's like,

937
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,260
oh yeah, we can get to that in the near future.

938
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,260
And it's really great to record there.

939
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:04,260
So if anyone has some extra ideas for the website,

940
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,900
they might even be crazy.

941
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,860
Just throw them in there, throw them in the mix

942
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,300
and we'll see what happens.

943
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,220
Yeah, so we have the jupiterbroadcasting.com project

944
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,660
on the main Jupyter Broadcasting GitHub page

945
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,900
if you wanna file an issue.

946
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,700
But really we'd love to just get your eyes

947
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,860
on jupiterbroadcasting.net.

948
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,580
That's the project site.

949
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:28,300
That's the development site, jupiterbroadcasting.net.

950
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,980
Maybe use that to listen to the next few podcasts,

951
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,540
give it a try for maybe the next few days.

952
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,860
And then if you run into something, let us know about it.

953
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,540
Or if you just have some thoughts, some general feedback

954
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,180
and you'd like to get involved in the conversation,

955
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,540
like Brent said, we've got that matrix room,

956
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,660
which we'd love to have you in there

957
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,780
and chatting with us about.

958
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,620
That's great.

959
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,580
And again, massive thank you, everyone.

960
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,340
It is a popular topic of conversation internally.

961
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,860
How awesome all of you are.

962
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,700
It's true.

963
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,620
Can't say it enough.

964
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,180
We'll have to make some t-shirts.

965
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,820
All right, so I woke up this morning

966
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,620
to a bit of feedback that I wanna talk about

967
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,500
on the show today.

968
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,100
And I want us to kind of chew this a little bit

969
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,700
and have a real honest conversation about it

970
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,700
because I think it's probably something

971
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,020
that's on some people's mind.

972
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:16,060
So I wanna talk about the boosts across all the JB shows,

973
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,900
the good and the bad,

974
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,340
and why I think people are probably getting tired of them.

975
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,460
And if they are getting tired of them,

976
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,140
why I think they're probably wrong.

977
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,300
And I'll give you my case.

978
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,140
It's not a judgment call,

979
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,100
but I'll make my case for you here in a little bit.

980
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,340
But first, I wanna say holler over to Linode.

981
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,540
Linode.com slash Jupiter.

982
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:37,860
Linode is investing right here in office hours

983
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:41,060
because they wanna invest in the community.

984
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,100
I mean, this isn't like, come on,

985
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,100
this isn't gonna be JB's biggest show.

986
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,500
And Linode is savvy enough to know that.

987
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,420
But they also know that the community

988
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,740
is worth investing in, that it pays dividends.

989
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,140
And that's also why they're making our road trip

990
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,620
possible again this year.

991
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,380
So go to linode.com slash Jupiter

992
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,420
and get $100 in 60 day credit over at Linode.

993
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,340
And you support the show.

994
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:05,500
It's where we host everything that we do publicly now.

995
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,100
Linode also has a bunch of really nice advanced features.

996
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,100
They support Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible.

997
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,580
They have a really clean, simple API

998
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,620
that already has a bunch of pre-created libraries

999
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:22,060
for Python and for Rust and for all the things.

1000
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,940
They also have a command line client that is choice.

1001
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,340
I really love that.

1002
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,740
In fact, a little pro tip,

1003
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,180
install the Linode command line client

1004
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,500
on your actual Linode machine, right?

1005
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,260
So then when you're SSHed into your Linode box,

1006
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,060
you could create a snapshot of that very box

1007
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,460
on that box before you do a system update.

1008
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:44,980
Just take it to the next level, guys.

1009
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,180
It's really easy.

1010
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,500
And of course they have great things

1011
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,580
like S3 compatible object storage,

1012
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,660
which you could always use as the seed for,

1013
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,020
I don't know, R2.

1014
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,700
And then you could just like have the most insane,

1015
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,660
great CDN with incredible reach at great prices.

1016
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,100
Oh, and by the way, Linode 30 to 50% cheaper

1017
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,700
than the hyperscalers out there.

1018
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,980
But there's a lot of ways you can host,

1019
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,380
but none of them are as good as Linode.

1020
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,300
They've got the best support.

1021
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,260
They got the best performance.

1022
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,820
They got 11 data centers

1023
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,780
and nobody else invests deep into the community,

1024
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,500
into the media, into the events, into the projects,

1025
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,660
even into things like road trips

1026
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,220
that just connect all of us together.

1027
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,500
Who else is doing that?

1028
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,980
Nobody.

1029
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,740
So go to linode.com slash Jupiter,

1030
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,980
support the show, say thanks for your support

1031
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:39,500
and get that $100 to mess around.

1032
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,340
It's pretty fun.

1033
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,620
Linode.com slash Jupiter.

1034
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,620
So I imagine now that we've been doing the boosts

1035
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,540
for a little while and they've been getting more popular,

1036
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,340
that there is going to be a group of people out there

1037
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,220
that are getting kind of sick and tired of the boosts.

1038
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,020
And I heard from some of them this morning

1039
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,100
in our matrix chat room.

1040
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,740
And I wanna talk about it here on the show

1041
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,700
because I get it, right?

1042
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,140
They've been around for a little while

1043
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,300
and they described it as boost fatigue.

1044
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,780
And I dug into it and I think it's worth us analyzing

1045
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,340
because I think they're wrong.

1046
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,620
And if you feel the same way,

1047
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,980
I think you might also wanna reconsider,

1048
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,540
but we'll talk about it.

1049
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,100
You let me know.

1050
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:20,980
So here's what I got.

1051
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,900
Is it just me?

1052
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,340
This was a, I won't mention who it is,

1053
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,100
but I think they probably represent

1054
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,060
a handful of folks out there.

1055
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,980
They say, is it just me?

1056
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,420
Or has anyone else got a bit of boost fatigue?

1057
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,620
Not just boost, but everything related to crypto as well

1058
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,420
in recent Jupiter broadcasting shows.

1059
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,060
So let's talk about this because I do think right about now

1060
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,140
is just about when everybody's gonna be kind of getting,

1061
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,660
if you're tired of it, you're tired of it about now.

1062
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,100
So this is the time to talk about it.

1063
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:50,100
And when I talk to these individuals in our matrix room,

1064
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:53,300
I ask them, okay, so if these were messages

1065
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:56,100
that were attached to a PayPal donation

1066
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,140
or emails that were just from our members,

1067
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,700
from like the unplugged core or the Jupiter party,

1068
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,540
if these were just emails from members

1069
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,220
that we were reading on the show,

1070
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,220
does it bug you as much?

1071
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,300
And the general response I got was no.

1072
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,780
I think what bugs me about the boosts

1073
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:15,420
is that they're associated with SATs.

1074
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,780
SATs, Satoshis, are crypto.

1075
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,980
And they don't like crypto.

1076
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,820
And I completely understand that perspective

1077
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,460
because I don't like crypto.

1078
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,180
And I will tell you right here, right now,

1079
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,860
when I engage in these conversations with the audience,

1080
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,340
one of the things I struggle with is

1081
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:42,100
when people refer to Bitcoin as crypto,

1082
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:47,020
I find it ignorant and triggering, right?

1083
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:50,620
It's like saying that you checked out Hannah Montana Linux,

1084
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,260
and because Hannah Montana Linux is such a joke,

1085
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,940
you're never gonna use Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

1086
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,900
So as a Linux user, that would upset you, right?

1087
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,620
I feel triggered.

1088
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:05,500
Yeah, so it's when you have a technical understanding

1089
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,020
of these different projects, these crypto projects,

1090
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,900
and you have a monetary understanding

1091
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:15,500
of these crypto projects, it's a triggering thing.

1092
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:20,020
It is like comparing RHEL or Ubuntu

1093
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:23,820
to Hannah Montana Linux, and I am not exaggerating at all.

1094
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,540
That is, and so when you understand the technicals,

1095
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,180
it's like, okay, all right,

1096
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,660
I'm gonna engage in this conversation,

1097
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:32,980
but they don't even really understand

1098
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:34,620
what they're talking about.

1099
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,980
And I don't mean to sound insulting.

1100
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:40,180
I have been following Bitcoin since 2010

1101
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,060
from a technical standpoint.

1102
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,780
That's 12 years I have followed an open source project.

1103
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:52,220
So I have a very deep understanding of Bitcoin, right?

1104
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,860
And I have spent the last 10 months

1105
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,380
deeply investigating the top 100 crypto projects,

1106
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,940
reading their white papers,

1107
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,980
tracking down their creators, the developers,

1108
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,300
following the communities.

1109
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:10,780
I have gone deep into all of this.

1110
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,980
And I have also, over the last year,

1111
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,100
been educating myself from a monetary policy standpoint.

1112
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,900
So I have a strong monetary policy understanding

1113
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,380
of how Bitcoin operates

1114
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,180
and how the other crypto projects operate.

1115
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,180
So from a monetary standpoint

1116
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,220
and from a technical standpoint

1117
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,340
and from a community standpoint

1118
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,340
and from a licensing standpoint,

1119
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,540
I do not consider Bitcoin equivalent

1120
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,980
to any of the other cryptocurrencies at all.

1121
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,180
And to associate myself with any of them,

1122
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,260
I find insulting.

1123
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:46,940
I find it gross.

1124
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,820
And so when somebody says,

1125
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:52,340
I don't like it when you talk about crypto,

1126
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,500
to imply that I'm talking about those other things,

1127
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,980
I find gross and insulting.

1128
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,220
And so I have to get past that.

1129
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,940
That's like my bias in these conversations

1130
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,060
is I have to realize that some people don't realize

1131
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,300
they're accusing me of promoting HANA Montana Linux

1132
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:05,140
when they say that,

1133
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,900
because they just haven't dug into it, right?

1134
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,020
And because people are technical in our community

1135
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,460
and they have an understanding of cryptology

1136
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,820
and they kind of get blockchain,

1137
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:15,260
they think they understand these projects.

1138
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,020
But there's a monetary aspect

1139
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,340
and there's a community aspect

1140
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,020
and there's a developer aspect

1141
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,700
and there's a licensing aspect.

1142
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:25,060
Just like with every other free software project,

1143
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,380
the 100% makes a difference.

1144
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,300
And Bitcoin is nothing,

1145
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,580
nothing like those other projects.

1146
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:35,860
There will never be another project like Bitcoin

1147
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:38,060
because they've all come after Bitcoin.

1148
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,660
So they all have a founder.

1149
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:40,860
They all have a core team

1150
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,740
that has influence over the project.

1151
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:45,740
They're all going to give out tokens ahead of time.

1152
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,620
They're all centralized.

1153
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:50,540
None of them are decentralized like Bitcoin.

1154
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,860
Bitcoin's founder is gone.

1155
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,620
There's no one person that has influence.

1156
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:56,380
There's no Vitalik, right?

1157
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,700
There's no VCs backing Bitcoin

1158
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,820
like there is for Solana or all the other cryptos.

1159
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,460
And then when you combine the Lightning Network,

1160
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,260
which is an open source peer-to-peer payments network

1161
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,980
that makes it stupid cheap to do transactions

1162
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,740
on top of this free software chain.

1163
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,220
And when you understand the difference

1164
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,820
between fiat money and hard money

1165
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,300
and the difference between tokens and Bitcoin,

1166
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,540
to compare the two is ludicrous.

1167
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,540
There's massive technical differences.

1168
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,580
I hope when we talk about this stuff

1169
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,300
that people are giving me some runway

1170
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,180
based on my track record of getting this stuff right,

1171
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,820
which I don't boast about,

1172
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:43,980
but I have a pretty good track record overall.

1173
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:47,820
And I'm telling you right now,

1174
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,780
I've done the homework on this.

1175
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:54,780
Some of this I have been following for 12 years.

1176
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,340
And I don't know if you have that same bench of experience

1177
00:47:58,340 --> 00:47:59,820
when you tell me you're sick of hearing us

1178
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,460
talk about crypto.

1179
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,300
But additionally, the shows are not about crypto

1180
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,300
and I don't wanna make them about crypto.

1181
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,660
So we have, after we were done introducing

1182
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,620
the concept of value for value,

1183
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,660
and after we were done introducing the concept of boosts

1184
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:15,020
and new podcast apps,

1185
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,380
and after we were done setting up our first node

1186
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,220
and self-hosting an entire show,

1187
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,340
self-hosting a node where we run that lightning network

1188
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:25,860
and self-host all of those boosts locally here on the land.

1189
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,220
After we were done talking about that discovery,

1190
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,820
we have greatly reduced the amount we were talking about it.

1191
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,820
In fact, we really don't talk about it.

1192
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,620
We don't describe what a Satoshi is.

1193
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,540
We don't really talk about our node anymore.

1194
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,300
We don't really mention anything other than

1195
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,940
you can go get a new podcast app.

1196
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,740
And we've done that to balance it all out.

1197
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:48,780
But what was really kind of at the core here

1198
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:49,940
and what really bothers them about it

1199
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:51,740
is it's associated with Satoshis.

1200
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,740
And I can understand that, but I would challenge

1201
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,300
that comes from a lack of understanding

1202
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,500
of the core technologies.

1203
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,380
And there is a very familiar headwind

1204
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,460
that I faced 15 years ago when I wanted to talk about Linux

1205
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,900
in the Pacific Northwest in Microsoft country.

1206
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,020
Very similar kind of headwind.

1207
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:18,020
And very similar thing where chicken free software projects

1208
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,380
would be compared to legitimate projects

1209
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,100
that had gained real traction.

1210
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,780
And people would use that as reasons

1211
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,820
to just dismiss Linux altogether

1212
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,620
or dismiss free software altogether.

1213
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:32,420
And you have to realize there's nuance in all of this stuff.

1214
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:34,140
It's just the nature of it.

1215
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:38,020
And so I guess I'm asking for a little bit of faith

1216
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:38,860
and runway here.

1217
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:42,900
Now, that said, this isn't a lot of negative feedback.

1218
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,820
This is just an open conversation I wanna have.

1219
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:48,260
It's not like this has become like some big resounding issue.

1220
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,580
But I think it's worth bringing up now

1221
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,780
because I estimate based on my understanding

1222
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,940
of content creation that if people are gonna feel fatigue

1223
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:59,020
with it, it's about right now it's gonna be setting in.

1224
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,260
That's my estimation.

1225
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,380
It's not something I've been hearing from a lot of people.

1226
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,820
I heard it from two people in our matrix room today.

1227
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,700
But I assume just based on what I understand

1228
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,660
about content creation, that now's about the time

1229
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:11,580
this is an issue.

1230
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,140
So I wanna address it now head on.

1231
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:17,020
The other feedback I got about the boosts,

1232
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,020
which on the majority is positive,

1233
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,620
but the other negative feedback I got about the boosts

1234
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,540
is that people don't like the soundboard clips

1235
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,380
when we do the boosts.

1236
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,260
And I totally get that.

1237
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:29,900
It's a show style thing.

1238
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,940
Like for example, in self-hosted,

1239
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,700
we don't play the soundboard clips.

1240
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,180
We don't do it there.

1241
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,060
The flip side is a lot of people do really like them.

1242
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:39,300
And people like to play along.

1243
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,300
They like to kind of suggest soundboard clips we could play.

1244
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,780
Like we just got the over 9,000 clip.

1245
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,540
And for some people, it incentivizes them

1246
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:46,540
to try to hit a certain mark.

1247
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,140
So that way they can trigger a certain soundboard level.

1248
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:54,460
So it can be a subtle way to encourage higher value boosts.

1249
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,100
But it also is a way to kind of break it up, make it fun.

1250
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,980
For me, it's a creative expression, right?

1251
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,700
I've thought about that a bit.

1252
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,660
Because the Linux community isn't really big

1253
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,860
on all that kind of stuff in general.

1254
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:09,420
I think the safe thing would be to err on the side of less.

1255
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,380
But it's sort of like driving.

1256
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:15,900
I could drive super safe all the time.

1257
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,540
And I'd fall asleep.

1258
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,860
And I'd get bored.

1259
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,380
And I wouldn't do it.

1260
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:23,660
Or I can drive in a way that I find

1261
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:26,420
to be somewhat kind of still safe, but interesting.

1262
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,860
Like maybe drive my RV.

1263
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,140
That's a big challenge.

1264
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,580
I find that really interesting.

1265
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,380
Maybe take a back road.

1266
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,860
And go around twists and have some fun with it.

1267
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,420
I find that a lot more interesting,

1268
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:38,420
a lot more challenging.

1269
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:40,260
So I'm more inclined to do that.

1270
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,420
So there's that element too.

1271
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:42,780
But it is always a balance.

1272
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,580
And I'm always trying to walk that line.

1273
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:45,980
And I don't want to overindulge.

1274
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,060
So that's feedback I take.

1275
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:50,540
And then one person mentioned that on some of the shows

1276
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,740
we're increasing the minimum SAT amount to get in,

1277
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,860
to get a boost into the show.

1278
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:57,620
And I did that.

1279
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,280
I implemented that because some of our shows

1280
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,740
we want to keep to a shorter runtime, like self-hosted.

1281
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:06,380
And so we just want to set a minimum threshold there.

1282
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,540
But they said that kind of feels like pay

1283
00:52:08,540 --> 00:52:10,380
to play a little bit, Chris.

1284
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:13,300
And I can see that point of view.

1285
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,000
Even though they're giving me this feedback

1286
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,580
and they've inspired this entire segment on the show

1287
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,380
using the free matrix platform that we

1288
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:23,220
self-host for our community.

1289
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,460
That's always the irony.

1290
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:28,580
I'm always taking this heat in a free feedback form.

1291
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,300
But you know.

1292
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,680
Well, I think what's true here is

1293
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,220
that there are two ways to get in.

1294
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,740
One is maybe hitting that threshold, which

1295
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:41,020
is, I think, an unfortunate sign of success, really.

1296
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:45,500
But the other one is if you have a really amazing idea

1297
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,100
or piece of feedback or something

1298
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:52,780
with true value in it that really sparks our tinkering

1299
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:57,780
brains, that will just cross the threshold.

1300
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,660
It skips to the front of the line.

1301
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,580
It does, yeah.

1302
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,660
I think that's really it.

1303
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:05,280
It's like, either give us the best piece of feedback

1304
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,280
we've seen in the last week, or we'll

1305
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,700
read everybody else's that have reached a certain threshold,

1306
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,140
because we can't possibly read them all at this time.

1307
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:15,940
And it's just kind of the reality at this point.

1308
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,620
It's a hard one.

1309
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:19,340
There's a reality there of showtime is valuable time.

1310
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,900
And it's not like the free mechanisms

1311
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,940
don't continue to persist.

1312
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,520
This is an addition, not a replacement.

1313
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,140
Email, Telegram, Matrix, it's all there still.

1314
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,140
Mumble room, it's all there.

1315
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:32,020
Some of it is even higher fidelity than the boost.

1316
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:34,620
But there is the element of, yeah, showtime is valuable.

1317
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:36,860
And I think that is kind of worth talking about here.

1318
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,260
It's like, if you look at it, every minute

1319
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,460
counts in a podcast, especially one

1320
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,940
that you're trying to keep like a 45-minute runtime or a 50

1321
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:46,820
minute runtime, or maybe a show you only do twice a month.

1322
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,740
So you really got to get that content ratio right.

1323
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,020
And so airtime is valuable.

1324
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,460
And the nice thing about the boost

1325
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:54,860
is there is a value for value exchange there.

1326
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:56,860
And that's something we can give to the audience.

1327
00:53:56,860 --> 00:54:00,340
But it's never meant to replace memberships or other mechanisms

1328
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:00,900
of feedback.

1329
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,660
It's meant to be as an additional way

1330
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,540
to support the shows.

1331
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,380
That's the thing.

1332
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:08,140
And so when we look at all of this feedback,

1333
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:10,860
like one of the things I take away from is like,

1334
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:13,940
I need to come up with a more clever way for the members,

1335
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:18,100
people who are on a membership plan, to give feedback.

1336
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,460
Like a way for like a bat line for the members.

1337
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,140
I like that.

1338
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,900
I didn't even think about it beforehand.

1339
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,940
But then it just seems obvious in retrospect.

1340
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:27,740
Like, OK, yeah.

1341
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:30,620
Like we got to make sure the members are taken care of there.

1342
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,420
And I've got like other ideas for the members, like swag-wise.

1343
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,820
But that, I like, oh, that's the lesson I've learned here

1344
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:38,100
is make the members feel like they've got a bat line too.

1345
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,340
So that's something we're going to work on there.

1346
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,380
And then we're always tweaking the balance of content

1347
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,840
to all of this, and like soundboard clips and all of that.

1348
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,700
So it's a process.

1349
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,900
And each show we're iterating in real time every single week.

1350
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,580
And so sometimes it happens as well.

1351
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:57,500
Probably not to people listen to this show, but to other folks is,

1352
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,940
they're two, three months behind.

1353
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,900
So they're just getting to the point

1354
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:01,940
where we just discovered Umbral and the fact

1355
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:03,260
that we could self-host all this.

1356
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,740
And they're like, oh, my gosh.

1357
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,700
Oh, my gosh.

1358
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,900
Like, wow, these guys are talking about this a lot.

1359
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,980
And it's like you fast forward three months.

1360
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,600
And now it's just like we've integrated it.

1361
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,260
It's standard.

1362
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:15,420
And we're not really focusing on it as much.

1363
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,980
It's just kind of how it goes, Bradley.

1364
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,260
OK, Acid Density has something in the chat room here.

1365
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:22,740
My only critique about Boost was it felt at times

1366
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,140
like it was being promoted as the only valid way

1367
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,620
to contribute.

1368
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:29,340
But that feeling has since faded.

1369
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,160
That's a good piece of feedback.

1370
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,380
I will agree with that, actually.

1371
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,560
I felt that a little bit as well.

1372
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,060
And not because that was true.

1373
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,540
For Linux Unplugged, for instance,

1374
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:45,020
I'm constantly going through all of the mail

1375
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,460
that we get, which some of it is incredibly great.

1376
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:50,700
We don't read it all because it doesn't all fit with the topic.

1377
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:53,820
Or maybe we've moved on, or maybe it's private,

1378
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,140
and et cetera, et cetera.

1379
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:59,820
But I do think that in the last four or six months,

1380
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:03,460
we have been putting extra attention on the Boosts

1381
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,020
to promote them because we think the technology behind them

1382
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,900
is very interesting and because there are some really cool

1383
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,180
projects that we're contributing to and with.

1384
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,020
And they're contributing back to our website

1385
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,600
as well, like Podverse, for instance,

1386
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,620
that are doing some really cool things

1387
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:23,300
with open source technologies in the ways that we love.

1388
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,940
So it's kind of like the leading edge

1389
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:28,980
of some of this neat technology that's really fun to be a part of.

1390
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:31,540
So I think that criticism is valid,

1391
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:36,420
that it has felt that the Boosts have been taking priority

1392
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,900
over some other feedback methods,

1393
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:39,620
but that that has switched recently.

1394
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:42,740
Yeah, and there is also a workflow component here.

1395
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,740
So the Boosts came in at the right time

1396
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,640
when we really needed a system.

1397
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,780
And the beautiful thing here is the Boosts went into a database.

1398
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:56,020
And they have a Rust server that sits in front of that,

1399
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,540
and it has an API.

1400
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,380
What did you say?

1401
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,100
A Rust server.

1402
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,300
Yeah, you want me to?

1403
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:00,800
Cool.

1404
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:11,380
And the great thing is that it plugs right into our workflow

1405
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,180
because every bit of feedback that comes in is timestamped.

1406
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,820
It's got the episode they were listening to, the episode number,

1407
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:20,900
and all of that is extractable from the database

1408
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:24,780
and sortable and organizable and fits right in with our workflow.

1409
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:29,140
But the other thing that is honestly just brilliant about them

1410
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:33,020
is they're read-only until we talk about them on air.

1411
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,780
There's not a direct mechanism for us to hit reply.

1412
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:42,980
And so that means I can read all of the Boosts for all of the shows.

1413
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:44,820
But when you get to email, because I either

1414
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,980
feel compelled to reply or reply to some of them

1415
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,380
or we got to save some of them for the show,

1416
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:55,060
I probably get to about 10% to 20% of the emails that come in because of that.

1417
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:58,820
But I can get to 100% of the Boosts for all the shows.

1418
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:01,980
And in part, it's because they're read-only.

1419
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,060
And the other thing is, is they're character-limited.

1420
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:06,700
They're longer than tweets, but they're character-limited.

1421
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,860
So it's not a book.

1422
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,820
It's not paragraph after paragraph.

1423
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,900
And so because it's concise feedback that is read-only,

1424
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:19,500
I can process that signal at 10x the rate I can process emails.

1425
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:23,540
That, Chris, I think is a really valid insight.

1426
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,340
I do, whenever I sit down to email, I know it's a process

1427
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:29,580
because I feel like they're two-way communications.

1428
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:35,220
And I always want to try to put a thoughtful reply if we can.

1429
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,140
But that also means the opposite, which is that I miss some

1430
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,060
and I never get to them and et cetera, et cetera.

1431
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,400
And I feel pretty bad about that.

1432
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,100
So that is a fascinating insight and I

1433
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,860
think says a lot about how archaic email might be.

1434
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:48,740
There's that, right?

1435
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:52,700
And then there's just the element of it

1436
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:57,380
has also led to really great conversations in the shows.

1437
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,380
Some of my favorite moments in the shows

1438
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:02,020
have been inspired by a Boost question

1439
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,420
that we never would have put in the doc.

1440
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:06,060
We never would have brainstormed.

1441
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,620
And then the other thing I've noticed

1442
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:11,860
is it has made us follow up a lot more on things

1443
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:15,860
that we talk about once and then forget to follow up on.

1444
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:18,140
Forget to follow up on how something went

1445
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:20,300
or what happened or like you've seen this happen

1446
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,300
several times with the Boost.

1447
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:22,220
It's like, oh, yeah, right.

1448
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:24,000
OK, yeah, here's what happened with that.

1449
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,540
Sorry, I forgot to mention that.

1450
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:26,660
That happens all the time.

1451
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:29,140
What's neat is they're one liners for something like that.

1452
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,780
They're one liners in our show doc

1453
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:33,200
that usually Wes and I haven't read yet.

1454
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,700
But you could just mention quickly

1455
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:37,500
and we can touch on it for the next minute or two

1456
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:41,460
and it's a super efficient method for us, really.

1457
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:44,260
And there's also the element of it

1458
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:46,740
has been a great source of discussion and conversation

1459
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,500
during the summer lull.

1460
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:52,920
There is a real drop in productivity

1461
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,220
in the free software community in the summer

1462
00:59:55,220 --> 01:00:01,420
because a lot of the world does this thing called vacation.

1463
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:04,540
Yeah, and they take weeks off at a time.

1464
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,780
Weeks off, like some of them.

1465
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:07,780
Like the peak part of the year.

1466
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:08,620
Yeah, like some of them are taking

1467
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,780
like six weeks off at a time.

1468
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,340
I don't even know how it works.

1469
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,540
And then they come back and they still have a job.

1470
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:13,060
Like, I don't know.

1471
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:14,660
But it sounds like a fantasy world.

1472
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:18,660
But it turns out outside of the states and other areas,

1473
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:19,820
there are parts of the world.

1474
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,460
And guess what?

1475
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:23,260
Those parts of the world also contribute to free software.

1476
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:27,940
And so guess what happens is you have a measurable drop

1477
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,780
in what's going on in the free software world.

1478
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:32,700
And Joe and I always call it the summer lull.

1479
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,740
And it's something he and I talk about because we're always

1480
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,780
ingesting the news as fast as it happens.

1481
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:40,060
So that way, we can talk about it, put it in the right shows,

1482
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:40,940
all that kind of stuff, right?

1483
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,860
He and I are constantly following the news.

1484
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:45,940
And you could probably chart it with a graph.

1485
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:47,860
In the summer, it just drops.

1486
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,580
There's just less activity going on.

1487
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:53,380
And so normally, we'd have like 40-minute, 30-minute shows.

1488
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:55,220
Like, we just would have shorter shows.

1489
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:57,700
And so instead, we're having these really great

1490
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:58,820
conversations.

1491
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:00,360
And in fact, we're talking about, OK,

1492
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,140
we've got to reduce our runtime.

1493
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:04,100
We're talking about needing to reduce our runtime

1494
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,020
in the summer.

1495
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:06,220
It's a good problem to have.

1496
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:06,700
Right.

1497
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,660
And so it's just, but if you don't

1498
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,200
know what goes into making the show,

1499
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,060
you might not realize that.

1500
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:13,260
But it's just one of those things where it's like,

1501
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,900
this has been a great thing to have in the summer

1502
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,780
because we've got a lot to talk about now.

1503
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:18,580
Like, we can show up knowing there's stuff

1504
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:20,740
to talk about in the summer.

1505
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,460
That's huge.

1506
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:25,260
And also, it happens in the holidays in the winter too.

1507
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:26,840
You know, you can imagine a lot of people

1508
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,580
when they're scratching their own itch,

1509
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:30,820
when there's other things going on like vacation and holidays,

1510
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:31,660
guess what happens?

1511
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:34,300
They focus on other stuff.

1512
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,300
And if you're following the news every single week

1513
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:38,900
because you've got to talk about it on three different shows,

1514
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,420
you notice those kinds of things.

1515
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:42,540
And the booths have been a tremendous help in that way

1516
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:43,040
as well.

1517
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,060
Not to mention, and this is the last point,

1518
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,860
but this is what I remember being the strongest thing

1519
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:51,460
that I really felt when we first introduced them.

1520
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:53,340
It has been years since I felt like I've

1521
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,460
had that kind of connection with the audience,

1522
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,940
especially with the COVID stuff.

1523
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:00,020
Like, it was like all of a sudden,

1524
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,740
a light went on in the darkness.

1525
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:03,540
Like, I had felt really disconnected.

1526
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:05,460
And I had felt really far.

1527
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:07,900
And you know, especially when like Twitter's going on

1528
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:08,780
and you have Telegram.

1529
01:02:08,780 --> 01:02:10,700
And it's like, it only represents

1530
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:12,220
a portion of the audience.

1531
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:15,080
And so it's really easy to build this model

1532
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:18,740
of the audience in your head that isn't accurate.

1533
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,700
And when you bring in this another source,

1534
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,900
it's just a new source along with the other ones,

1535
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,580
it gives you another data point.

1536
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,620
It gives you another source of signal

1537
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:30,820
to build the appropriate model in your head

1538
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,500
of who you're talking to.

1539
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,660
And for me, it has been a tremendously healthy improvement

1540
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:38,660
to the model I have in my head.

1541
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:42,460
It has improved the virtual audience who I am talking to.

1542
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,420
When I'm speaking to the microphone,

1543
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:48,860
I have a better representation and a fonder representation

1544
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,660
of the person I am speaking to now.

1545
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:53,340
Because I'm speaking to this new group who

1546
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:55,640
gives me a new data input that is different than what

1547
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,140
I'm getting on Twitter, YouTube, and Telegram, and Matrix,

1548
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,100
and stuff like that.

1549
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,540
And email.

1550
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,660
And for me, as a content creator,

1551
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:06,740
the fact that this can come in a dashboard

1552
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:09,020
where there has to be a bit of a monetary exchange

1553
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,660
to get it in front of me.

1554
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:13,820
And so we're both paying a cost.

1555
01:03:13,820 --> 01:03:17,220
I'm paying my time, my energy, my emotional investment.

1556
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,920
In fact, this is my business, and this

1557
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,300
is what I'm spending my time on.

1558
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:21,480
Those are my costs.

1559
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:24,460
And there's the sat cost for the person to send the message in.

1560
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:27,420
And so we both have a little bit of skin in the game.

1561
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:31,740
It tremendously improves the level of feedback that we get.

1562
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:32,520
Good and bad.

1563
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,380
The negative stuff, we absolutely

1564
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:37,860
get critical feedback and the positive feedback.

1565
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:42,140
It is a step above what we get.

1566
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:43,860
And what we traditionally email, I'd say,

1567
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:47,600
is the next best signal in terms of thoughtfulness and barrier.

1568
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,940
It takes you a little bit of work

1569
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:50,900
to actually send an effing email.

1570
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,020
And then you have the contact form.

1571
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:55,220
And then you have Telegram and Matrix.

1572
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:56,620
And then you have Twitter.

1573
01:03:56,620 --> 01:03:59,640
And then you have YouTube comments and Reddit comments.

1574
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:01,900
And as you go down that stack, there's

1575
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,580
sometimes good stuff anywhere in that stack,

1576
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:07,040
but often it declines in quality.

1577
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:09,420
And so for me, somebody post-pandemic

1578
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:10,940
who's used to doing meetups and has

1579
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:12,820
been lived in this social bubble for a while

1580
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:16,580
now to get this new signal that we're both of us

1581
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,260
have some skin in the game.

1582
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:21,760
And so the quality, the duration, and the workflow

1583
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,180
are all better.

1584
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:26,020
And there's actually some monetary exchange there too.

1585
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:28,180
So it's like even when I get bad news,

1586
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,840
there's a little bit of sugar with it.

1587
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,380
You know what I'm saying?

1588
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,660
Like that medicine goes down a little bit better.

1589
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,260
And last but not least, I know I keep saying this,

1590
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:38,660
but it's a shift.

1591
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:42,460
Podcasting will never be the same again.

1592
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:45,360
The number one advantage YouTube has

1593
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,460
over going off and doing a podcast

1594
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,540
is if you are successful on YouTube,

1595
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:52,540
there is a guaranteed path to monetization.

1596
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:54,520
The platform will monetize for you.

1597
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:57,460
You just got to get the views.

1598
01:04:57,460 --> 01:04:59,740
That's not how podcasting works.

1599
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:01,860
You got to get the views or the listens,

1600
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:03,900
and you got to go get the money.

1601
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:04,880
You got to do sales.

1602
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,420
You got to do something.

1603
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,020
You got to do both pieces.

1604
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:11,860
You don't just show up and podcast and get a big podcast

1605
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:12,460
and make money.

1606
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:14,500
In fact, it is all cost.

1607
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:16,420
It is all cost, right?

1608
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:18,500
Google pays for everything on YouTube.

1609
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:20,920
But for podcasting, you're paying for the distribution.

1610
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,260
You're paying for the hosting.

1611
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:23,780
You're paying for the domain name.

1612
01:05:23,780 --> 01:05:26,180
You're paying for everything, right?

1613
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:27,420
Google's got you over there.

1614
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,940
And then they're going to help you monetize it, too.

1615
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:32,100
That's pretty attractive.

1616
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:34,580
But you see what it creates.

1617
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:36,680
You see what the results are of that.

1618
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,980
You see the incentives that creates

1619
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:43,420
and the problems with Google centralizing all of that.

1620
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:45,620
You're fully aware of that.

1621
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,940
That's not a problem podcasting has.

1622
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:51,060
And Boost and the Lightning Network

1623
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:55,700
offer, if they are successful, a potential default way

1624
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:02,060
to monetize podcasting that is creating the biggest

1625
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:04,100
customer out of the audience.

1626
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:07,420
So the podcaster and the business from get-go,

1627
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:12,340
from episode one, is 100% focused

1628
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:14,580
on super serving the audience because they're

1629
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:16,460
the ones consuming the content.

1630
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:19,220
And they're the ones paying for the content.

1631
01:06:19,220 --> 01:06:22,380
So the incentives for the creator are 100% aligned

1632
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:23,900
with the incentives of the audience.

1633
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:27,060
Not an algorithm, not a multinational billion dollar

1634
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:30,640
corporation, but with the audience.

1635
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:35,220
And it's being done over a free software peer-to-peer payment

1636
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:41,460
network that anyone can run on a Raspberry Pi in their home.

1637
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:45,940
It fundamentally is a land shift change for podcasting

1638
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:48,500
if it's successful.

1639
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:51,740
And it could keep podcasting independent and free

1640
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:53,660
for the next decade.

1641
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:57,700
It's huge because it allows us to maintain the public RSS

1642
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,300
format and the public directory format

1643
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:03,260
and giving the podcast away for free.

1644
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:07,380
But it avoids all of the evil incentives

1645
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:09,940
that are created by a centralized platform

1646
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:13,460
to monetize and have an algorithm for discovery.

1647
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:16,420
It could create something truly beautiful

1648
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:18,100
in independent media.

1649
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,340
It probably couldn't come at a more important time

1650
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:24,100
in human history when it comes to media, independent media,

1651
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,460
and what you can trust.

1652
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:28,020
OK, now I'm truly done.

1653
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,580
One perspective I keep coming to is like, Chris,

1654
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:33,220
if you and I were to sit down and we didn't know about Bitcoin

1655
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,380
and we didn't know about lightning

1656
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:35,820
and we didn't know about the value for value

1657
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:37,100
and the boosts and stuff like that.

1658
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:38,540
And we sat down, we said, hey, we

1659
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:43,420
need a way for listeners to support the podcast network.

1660
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:45,360
What would we come up with?

1661
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,780
And it would be something that is open source,

1662
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:50,300
that's decentralized.

1663
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,420
Built into the app.

1664
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,260
You could just push a button in the app.

1665
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:56,900
Sure, sure, yeah, or even our new website, for instance.

1666
01:07:56,900 --> 01:08:01,540
It would be something that has relatively low barrier

1667
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,460
to entry.

1668
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:05,740
So yeah, you got to jump through a few technical hoops.

1669
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:07,340
That's actually an advantage for us

1670
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:14,260
because a few barriers to entry equals better content.

1671
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:16,940
We've seen that repeatedly on various platforms.

1672
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:18,820
Mumble is a great example of that.

1673
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:21,860
Well, and if we don't have a technical early adopter

1674
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:23,340
audience, who does, right?

1675
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:24,340
So some of us have got to.

1676
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:25,260
That is very fair.

1677
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:27,940
Right, that's how we get this made is the early adopters.

1678
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:28,620
And that's us.

1679
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:29,660
We're the early adopters.

1680
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:32,220
And we don't ask that everyone be an early adopter.

1681
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:34,300
But we're like, hey, if you want to run with scissors with us,

1682
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,940
come along, grab your scissors, let's go.

1683
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:38,140
It's fun.

1684
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:40,660
So I keep thinking, what would we build differently?

1685
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:43,220
And I don't think I really have a great answer for that.

1686
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:45,260
Yeah, because the payment system,

1687
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:48,020
the fact that people could send us a fraction of a penny

1688
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:49,100
is remarkable.

1689
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:52,420
But there's the other aspect of the network effect here.

1690
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:56,060
So I was on the podcasting 2.0 show like episode 94,

1691
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:57,720
Bells Out episode.

1692
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,980
And guess what happened?

1693
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:02,860
Several of our audience members boosted their episode

1694
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:05,260
because I was on there to say thanks for having Chris.

1695
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:06,700
The opposite happened as well.

1696
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:09,460
We got some new audience members from that.

1697
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:11,120
Exactly, and they boosted in.

1698
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:15,380
And imagine what happens when the next Linux podcaster

1699
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:17,420
decides to try this.

1700
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,340
They're going to immediately have boosts coming in.

1701
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:21,500
And I know this because I'm on the Bitcoin Dad Pod,

1702
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:24,500
and he's getting boosts from JBU audience members all the time.

1703
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:26,760
And imagine what happens when the next free software

1704
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,860
developer or free software project,

1705
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:30,900
the next interview we do, or the next project

1706
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:33,540
we talk about where they've got a lightning node address,

1707
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:34,540
and we include them in our splits.

1708
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:35,700
They're going to get boosts.

1709
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,620
They're going to get SATs.

1710
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:40,460
It just grows and grows and grows.

1711
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:44,180
To stop doing this because people don't like crypto

1712
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,420
would be the equivalent of me stopping to talk about,

1713
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:49,340
stop talking about free software and Linux 15 years ago

1714
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:53,060
because people liked Windows and Apple's ecosystem.

1715
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,100
I agree.

1716
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:58,700
If I was on here shilling Ethereum or Solona,

1717
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:00,900
you know, Avalanche or whatever.

1718
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:01,780
Doge.

1719
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,340
Doge, yeah.

1720
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,760
I think it'd be grotesque, and I think

1721
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,060
you should stop listening.

1722
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:10,260
I would not be mentally sane.

1723
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:11,620
I just couldn't.

1724
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,580
But that's not Bitcoin.

1725
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:17,660
And I ask if you don't believe that to maybe trust

1726
01:10:17,660 --> 01:10:20,340
that I've done the homework, that I've got 12 years

1727
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:23,340
of experience on this, and I've gone really

1728
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:26,620
deep on a lot of this stuff.

1729
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:30,540
And I've been doing it recently too, so it's super fresh.

1730
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:34,080
Conclusion is Bitcoin and the Lightning Network

1731
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,340
are a net positive for both free software, for podcasting,

1732
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:39,260
and for all of humanity.

1733
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:45,340
And the other stuff, 98% of it, Monero and a few others

1734
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:48,580
accepted, are probably absolute complete total scams

1735
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:51,040
in securities and should be completely cracked down

1736
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:52,260
by the SEC.

1737
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:54,660
And I just personally feel that way.

1738
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,020
And it's not a judgment call.

1739
01:10:56,020 --> 01:10:57,340
If you like those things, good on you.

1740
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:00,220
You're probably going to make some money in the next,

1741
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,600
I don't know, three to four years after the market comes

1742
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:03,100
back.

1743
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:08,260
But in the meantime, just trust me that I truly

1744
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:10,100
believe there's a differentiation there.

1745
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:13,060
And if I didn't, I wouldn't talk about it on the shows

1746
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,100
like we have.

1747
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,460
And the technology, the Lightning technology, I think,

1748
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:18,840
is super powerful.

1749
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,540
And I think we're going to see a lot of innovations there.

1750
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,580
If you look at it just from a hiring standpoint,

1751
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,980
there's a lot of cool jobs to build out the Lightning

1752
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:26,220
Network.

1753
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:28,720
There's a lot of applications being built on that right now.

1754
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,460
A lot of companies that are hiring to build on top of that.

1755
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:34,380
And it's all free software, guys.

1756
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:35,620
So it's pretty cool stuff.

1757
01:11:35,620 --> 01:11:36,740
All right.

1758
01:11:36,740 --> 01:11:37,620
Let's move the F on.

1759
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:41,940
Speaking of boosts, let's do a little bit of boosting.

1760
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:45,980
Ask not what your podcast can boost for you,

1761
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:49,140
but what you can boost for your podcast.

1762
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:52,100
Like a clock, the Golden Dragon, not only

1763
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:54,820
making it to live shows, hanging out in the matrix,

1764
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:56,860
but boosting like a maniac.

1765
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:00,140
Talk about a community member who just,

1766
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:02,380
before we launched the boosts, I don't

1767
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:03,940
think I knew the Golden Dragon's name.

1768
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:07,580
And now I feel like the Golden Dragon's a buddy of mine.

1769
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,540
Like, I'd go over to the Wing Shop

1770
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,180
and have a beer with the Golden Dragon.

1771
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:15,260
And he boosted it with 2,222 sats, a row of ducks.

1772
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:18,860
I'm a duck, D-U-K, duck, loaded with talent.

1773
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:20,420
And he also has you in mind.

1774
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,420
He says, I am coming in hot with this boost.

1775
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:24,540
Coming in hot with the boost.

1776
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:26,260
I love that one so much.

1777
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:26,940
I know.

1778
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:27,840
We've got to get some new ones.

1779
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:29,460
People got to send us in some new ones.

1780
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:31,100
He says, last episode was a great show.

1781
01:12:31,100 --> 01:12:33,140
One day I hope to be good enough of a dev

1782
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,580
to give back to the community.

1783
01:12:34,580 --> 01:12:36,060
That has welcomed me with open arms.

1784
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:37,460
Thanks for the advice and my journey.

1785
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:38,140
Brent.

1786
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:41,060
Well, here's another piece of advice, I think.

1787
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:42,660
Our website is a great way to do that.

1788
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:47,620
There's some, like, I hesitate to call them low skill tasks

1789
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:48,460
that we need done.

1790
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:51,500
But I have been tagging some stuff, like, hey,

1791
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:55,260
this is a great first, like, beginner task.

1792
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:56,600
And I fit that mold.

1793
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,060
I don't know what I'm doing when it

1794
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,420
comes to building a Hugo website.

1795
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:01,100
But some of these things are really straightforward,

1796
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,680
like some content or just changing something simple

1797
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,700
that can get your big toe wet.

1798
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:07,820
So that would be an interesting place to get started.

1799
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:10,140
Yeah, I'd say do something low hanging

1800
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:16,380
like that that gets you just familiar with using Git,

1801
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:18,080
gets you familiar with interacting

1802
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,780
with a community that's working on something

1803
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:21,420
because that's a lot different than just working

1804
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:22,740
on something by yourself.

1805
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:24,420
Don't even worry about the language.

1806
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:26,620
Don't even worry about the tech, necessarily.

1807
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:28,400
This is advice I give on Coda Radio, too.

1808
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,260
It's like, just get in there and learn to work with people.

1809
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,660
Learn to work with Git, maybe GitHub.

1810
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:38,500
That skill set, you can apply to any language to any project.

1811
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:41,360
And it makes you immediately valuable to just

1812
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,740
about any other project if you've

1813
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:44,500
got that stuff figured out.

1814
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,520
So that's my advice.

1815
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,520
I think one really nice thing about the website

1816
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,020
is that clearly, the Golden Dragon's

1817
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,980
been listening for a long time.

1818
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:57,020
So you already have a lot of the context for this project.

1819
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:59,120
And you may not understand the technology that's

1820
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,540
underlying the whole website.

1821
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:03,980
But because you have a deep understanding of the context,

1822
01:14:03,980 --> 01:14:07,500
you can really apply a lot of great feedback

1823
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:08,780
to the whole process.

1824
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:11,220
And someone else can go implement the technical part.

1825
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:12,780
At least that's how I'm doing it.

1826
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:14,660
And maybe one day, that'll be you implementing

1827
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:17,700
the technical part as skills move forward, right?

1828
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:18,540
It's cool.

1829
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:21,380
Trevdev boosted in with some LeetSats.

1830
01:14:21,380 --> 01:14:26,700
Boost and value for value are the only web 3 concept I like.

1831
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,620
He says, the only thing I don't like about boost

1832
01:14:28,620 --> 01:14:32,540
is that I cannot always get a reply like I can with an email.

1833
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:33,940
Thanks for choosing independence.

1834
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,940
Congratulations on the progress with the new site.

1835
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:37,860
The static site route is the best route.

1836
01:14:37,860 --> 01:14:38,740
I agree.

1837
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:42,060
Very happy to have a static site after years of WordPress.

1838
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,440
Yeah, so it is tricky.

1839
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:45,940
There are definitely boosts that have come in where I'm like,

1840
01:14:45,940 --> 01:14:47,400
I would like to reply to that one.

1841
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:51,300
I've even thought about, well, actually, OK.

1842
01:14:51,300 --> 01:14:54,040
I have actually occasionally, every now and then,

1843
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:56,020
tracked folks down that are on Matrix.

1844
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:58,100
Because a lot of times, people will boost in

1845
01:14:58,100 --> 01:14:59,780
with their Matrix username as well.

1846
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:00,900
It's like they use the same username.

1847
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:03,620
So then I can find them on Matrix, and I can reply.

1848
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:05,580
So I actually have done that a couple of times.

1849
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:09,740
I think I remember in Fountain, I

1850
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:11,820
think I remember a feature in Fountain where you may

1851
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:13,060
be able to do replies.

1852
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:15,020
But I have not tried it.

1853
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:17,320
And I think it might be worth us investigating that.

1854
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:18,980
I have done that once or twice as well.

1855
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:20,060
Thank you for reminding me.

1856
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:20,820
That is true.

1857
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:24,860
But for the most part, I'd say for like 99% of them,

1858
01:15:24,860 --> 01:15:27,620
what I find to be beneficial is that I can't reply.

1859
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:30,140
I mean, just think about that from a processing standpoint.

1860
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:32,460
We just mentioned that was the best.

1861
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:35,780
And actually, we probably reply much more thoughtfully

1862
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:36,820
on the show anyways.

1863
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:37,660
That's true.

1864
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:38,340
That's true.

1865
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:40,820
Then you've got to wait to hear it on the show, I suppose.

1866
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:48,220
All right, so Dilan, or Dylon, boosted in with 9,999 sats,

1867
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:49,540
which I think is our top booster.

1868
01:15:49,540 --> 01:15:52,020
Because I'm a back home baller.

1869
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:54,300
If I want something, I just holler.

1870
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:54,920
He says, thanks.

1871
01:15:54,920 --> 01:15:57,220
Yeah, it can be pronounced Dylon.

1872
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:00,840
But Dilan, or really just Dilan, are acceptable.

1873
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,460
When I was young, I had a friend whose parents were from Germany

1874
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,460
and they simply just could not pronounce my name.

1875
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,580
So now I use it everywhere as my handle.

1876
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:09,500
Thanks again for the soundboard suggestion.

1877
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,900
I had mentioned a couple of soundboards last episode.

1878
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,980
I look forward to running with scissors.

1879
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:15,720
So that's the other thing about the boost

1880
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:19,920
and the whole podcasting 2.0 thing is for 14 years, kind of.

1881
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:21,880
I felt like we've been in our own little bubble,

1882
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:25,280
just doing our own little thing, and not really part

1883
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,940
of anything else much.

1884
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:28,740
We do have some Linux friends and stuff,

1885
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:30,300
but I felt like it's been very isolated

1886
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:33,220
overall when you look at the entire podcast market.

1887
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:35,660
And then this podcasting 2.0 stuff,

1888
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:38,020
which includes the boosts and the namespace support

1889
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:40,420
and the new features we're all working on,

1890
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:42,260
it's felt like a broader community.

1891
01:16:42,260 --> 01:16:44,500
We're part of something bigger now.

1892
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:46,180
And for the first time, I felt like I'm

1893
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:49,300
working together with a bunch of peers

1894
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:52,300
to make the medium that we all love better,

1895
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:54,420
to invest in the medium.

1896
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:56,540
And it's never felt better.

1897
01:16:56,540 --> 01:17:00,340
That has felt like I didn't realize I was missing it.

1898
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:01,260
You know what I mean?

1899
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:03,300
Yeah, I would imagine for you as an early adopter

1900
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:07,500
of podcasting itself, this is like next level involvement

1901
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,960
and pretty darn exciting.

1902
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,700
It was fun to be on the podcasting 2.0 show as well.

1903
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:19,180
One last boost came in from Rose Deer, 3,333 sets.

1904
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,300
Boost!

1905
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:23,780
On the topic of new RSS feeds for the shows,

1906
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:27,860
I'd be interested in an edited version of LUP,

1907
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:30,620
so Drew's edited version of the main show,

1908
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:33,780
with an unedited free and post show.

1909
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,060
That's a monstrosity.

1910
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,180
I know Wes and I were talking about this

1911
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:38,640
after the last Office Hours, because I

1912
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,180
think it might have been Optimus Gray or somebody that

1913
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:42,900
boosted in and said, I'd like a different arrangement.

1914
01:17:42,900 --> 01:17:44,700
And I thought, how wild would it be

1915
01:17:44,700 --> 01:17:47,540
if we could just take the different chapters

1916
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:50,780
in our podcasts and release them as individual modules?

1917
01:17:50,780 --> 01:17:53,340
And then you could go to a website dashboard

1918
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,980
and assemble the custom module feed that you wanted

1919
01:17:55,980 --> 01:17:58,020
and generate your own one-off feed, right?

1920
01:17:58,020 --> 01:17:58,980
That is so great.

1921
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:02,020
You got to put a ticket in our website and make it happen.

1922
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:04,460
That is a really fabulous idea.

1923
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:08,980
We got to get to the generating our own RSS feeds part first.

1924
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:09,660
We'll get there.

1925
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:10,540
We'll get there.

1926
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:13,580
But it feels like a little bit like spins

1927
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:14,780
of some of the distributions.

1928
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:17,100
You know, you put your own LEGO pieces together.

1929
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:18,260
I love this idea.

1930
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,340
I think it sounds technically very challenging,

1931
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:22,780
but it sounds really fun as a user.

1932
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:24,820
You'd want something on the back end

1933
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:27,100
that could read the chapters of the MP3 file

1934
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,860
and cut it up and then deliver it.

1935
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:31,820
It sounds like the technology is there, though.

1936
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,620
It's just about putting it together.

1937
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:34,660
Yeah, I imagine, right?

1938
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:36,980
You'd want to include the ads, because otherwise, people

1939
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:38,260
would just cut out all the ads all the time.

1940
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,020
But what if they're a member?

1941
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:40,940
Yeah, right.

1942
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:41,700
That's the thing.

1943
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:43,480
If they're a member, then they should get the ability

1944
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:44,780
not to include them, right?

1945
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:45,980
But your ads are so great, sometimes

1946
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:46,820
you just want to hear them.

1947
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:48,140
You know, you say that, but we actually

1948
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,380
have gotten feedback from the members.

1949
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:50,860
They're like, I actually don't mind the ads.

1950
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:51,940
I just want to support you.

1951
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:54,780
And so some of them might actually choose to include them.

1952
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:56,260
We have a member's ad feed as well.

1953
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:03,260
So, Rose Deer, I have no idea exactly what we're going to do.

1954
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:05,060
But as we build out this new infrastructure,

1955
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:08,100
I'm starting to see new possibilities.

1956
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:10,420
I imagine Wes listening right now going, oh, god.

1957
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:11,820
Yeah, Wes just commented on it.

1958
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:13,740
I could see him commenting in real time.

1959
01:19:13,740 --> 01:19:14,540
It's pretty funny.

1960
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:16,140
He's like, shut up, shut up.

1961
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:19,340
Just don't say anything.

1962
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:22,340
We got some thank you boosts, 100 sats from Marcel.

1963
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:25,700
He says, plus one for the only bonus stuff feed idea.

1964
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:27,140
That was the one we got last week,

1965
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:29,100
was just the bonus stuff feed.

1966
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:32,280
And then, oh, this is actually our top baller.

1967
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:33,340
I apologize.

1968
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:34,780
I didn't realize this.

1969
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:36,780
10,000 sats from Silver Snake.

1970
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:38,220
No message, just a thank you.

1971
01:19:38,220 --> 01:19:42,500
Because I'm a back home baller in pajamas that cost $10.

1972
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,060
Tell my mother that I love her more than any freaking other.

1973
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:48,500
That's the life of a back home baller.

1974
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,020
So thank you, Silver Snake.

1975
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:53,780
You are a back home baller in our neck of the woods.

1976
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:55,620
If you'd like to send a boost into the show,

1977
01:19:55,620 --> 01:19:58,820
go get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

1978
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:00,500
I love Fountain FM and Podverse.

1979
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:01,960
Those are fantastic.

1980
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:04,620
If you're on iOS and you're just jonesing for CarPlay,

1981
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:07,300
Cast-O-Matic is definitely worth a look.

1982
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:10,380
And if you don't want to switch apps, you'll like your app.

1983
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:14,220
Well, then go get Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z dot technology,

1984
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:16,580
or boost us in with Boost CLI.

1985
01:20:16,580 --> 01:20:18,660
I think it's been weeks since anybody

1986
01:20:18,660 --> 01:20:20,060
has boosted with Boost CLI.

1987
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:20,940
It's true.

1988
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:24,060
I guess the command line is just, it's too hard for people.

1989
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:24,780
Well, we'll see.

1990
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:25,360
It's too hard.

1991
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:25,860
We'll see.

1992
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:26,900
We'll see.

1993
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:33,300
And 50% of all of those boosts go to Brent Gas Tank Fund

1994
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:35,420
to get them out here to the studio in a few weeks.

1995
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:37,220
So thank you, everybody.

1996
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:38,820
We appreciate that.

1997
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:40,980
And that was also a fun experiment

1998
01:20:40,980 --> 01:20:43,380
in Brent running his own node.

1999
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:45,540
We should have you dive in and do like a record.

2000
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:46,420
Yeah, we should give an update.

2001
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:47,340
A retrospective.

2002
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:47,940
You're right.

2003
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:49,380
Maybe on the next Office Hours.

2004
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:49,940
Maybe.

2005
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:50,460
Maybe.

2006
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,220
In the meantime, we'll have links

2007
01:20:52,220 --> 01:20:55,220
to the stuff we talked about over at officehours.hares

2008
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:56,660
slash 9.

2009
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:58,860
You can also subscribe to our RSS feed over there,

2010
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:00,700
because we've got a ton of stuff coming up.

2011
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:02,820
Besides the website, we've got a road trip project.

2012
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:05,120
And then after that, I mean, there's a lot.

2013
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,700
But one of the things on my radar

2014
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,060
that I know we're going to organize here

2015
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:09,460
on the show with the community is

2016
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:11,900
I want to take the taxis to the next level.

2017
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:15,100
And I think this is going to be where we plant our flag

2018
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,180
and organize that.

2019
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:18,940
So that way we can come to Linux unplugged with great results.

2020
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:19,900
You know what I mean?

2021
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:21,980
So that'll be coming up way in the future,

2022
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:23,460
because we've got website stuff still.

2023
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:24,380
We got road trip stuff.

2024
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,900
But we got, I mean, there's just a lot going on still.

2025
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,740
So go to officehours.hares slash subscribe.

2026
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:30,820
So that way you're on the inside loop of everything

2027
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:32,860
that's going on over at Jupiter Broadcasting.

2028
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:34,420
And of course, we got our contact page

2029
01:21:34,420 --> 01:21:38,180
over there where you can send us in your contacts for free.

2030
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:41,300
And you know, maybe we'll talk about it in a future episode.

2031
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:43,660
In the meantime, Office Hours are over.

2032
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:44,860
It's mine again.

2033
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:45,580
Go on.

2034
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:46,540
Get out of here.

2035
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:49,380
And please, take your garbage with you, would you?

2036
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:51,180
I'm not your dad.

2037
01:21:51,180 --> 01:22:15,660
See you next time.
