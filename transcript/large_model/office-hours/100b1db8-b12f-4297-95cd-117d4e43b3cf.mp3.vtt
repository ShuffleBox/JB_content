WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.240
How you feeling about recording this week you think you're gonna be able to get that thing to record well

00:03.240 --> 00:05.760
I have my own account now, so I feel like I have

00:06.240 --> 00:08.240
Jumped a few hurdles. Oh

00:08.440 --> 00:11.480
Really mm-hmm Alex may be an account on his laptop here

00:12.200 --> 00:17.120
So now I don't need his fingerprint. You know I've had that finger laying around, but it's kind of getting a little yeah

00:17.160 --> 00:20.920
I've had her on ice, but the ice is last forever. You know you had to make a call on that finger

00:20.920 --> 00:23.640
I get it. Yeah, I think you could have brought it with you. I

00:24.520 --> 00:27.200
Think you probably could you know he's got so many laptops over there

00:27.200 --> 00:30.040
You probably could have taken that laptop in that finger, and he wouldn't even noticed

00:30.280 --> 00:35.080
I'm not sure which one he's got more of fingers or laptops. I think there are one two three

00:35.680 --> 00:36.920
four

00:36.920 --> 00:42.560
Laptops on well that's sort of a mini desktop, but just on this one table surface right now

00:42.920 --> 00:48.760
Yeah, well it makes for good video for the live stream, so that's good. There's also that one over there with some rather

00:49.920 --> 00:51.920
Graphics stuff on it that is

00:51.920 --> 00:59.520
An homage PC is it really oh, it's this is a big deal. That's an homage to a great television show called

00:59.720 --> 01:01.720
Silicon Valley and

01:02.080 --> 01:04.120
one of the characters in that show

01:05.360 --> 01:11.580
He has a signature line of servers for the data center, and he wants his signature on the servers

01:11.880 --> 01:15.540
But he's such an egomaniac that that just happens to be what his signature looks like

01:17.120 --> 01:19.120
It ends up looking like a penis and so

01:19.120 --> 01:25.540
And it's a great storyline because like the the product team like tries to like show him all these other options that are

01:25.680 --> 01:31.920
Clearly better options, but his own ego won't let him choose anything else and so they end up shipping a penis logo on

01:32.480 --> 01:38.440
All of them you know I've wanted to ask Alex from like about day three that I've been here several weeks ago

01:39.320 --> 01:42.400
But I was a little too shy to ask him about the penis

01:42.720 --> 01:46.080
Can I ask what you just assumed the reason there was a penis on his PC?

01:46.080 --> 01:53.040
I assumed there was some backstory that I wasn't privy to but I just couldn't bring myself to asking the question for him to explain

01:53.040 --> 01:57.080
The joke so thank you for informing me. Can I ask you to the thought cross your mind, huh?

01:57.920 --> 02:00.960
Alex likes penises more than I thought he did

02:01.440 --> 02:06.400
Did that did that cross your mind? That's also a worm penis because it's on a power source. Yeah, yeah

02:08.400 --> 02:09.600
I

02:09.600 --> 02:12.160
Think the first time I saw it. I was like no. I didn't just see that

02:12.160 --> 02:17.960
That's not meant to be like that and then I saw it again. I was like oh, there's something going on here. Oh really yeah

02:19.200 --> 02:25.600
Yeah, so the first pass you thought oh, no, that's just me seeing something. Yeah, yeah, so you thought you were the weirdo

02:25.600 --> 02:32.400
I see I see I'm in a foreign place sure yeah, and you want to be charitable to your buddy right try so

02:33.000 --> 02:37.760
It's like I'm not ashamed of you Alex. I'm ashamed of me for thinking it's a penis

02:37.760 --> 02:41.120
Yeah, yeah, it's my fault not your fault. That's me. It's not

02:43.220 --> 02:47.720
Well I I tried to have a meal before the show so I don't run out of energy and

02:48.640 --> 02:52.360
How'd you do? I don't know I think I did all right. You know I had some salmon

02:52.360 --> 02:58.020
I feels like a good choice was it like smoked or was it poached or how was it poached?

02:58.520 --> 03:02.240
I'd answer. I don't actually know cuz it was prepared for me. I'll be honest

03:02.240 --> 03:10.040
The life made it last night, and I brought it I brought it to work with me it could have been broiled who knows yeah

03:10.040 --> 03:12.280
I just don't know I brought it to work with me

03:12.280 --> 03:15.880
I just thought you know it'd be nice to have something to eat before we start cuz you know how I get

03:16.600 --> 03:18.640
You know how I get I know how you get too

03:18.640 --> 03:21.660
Oh, I get the both of us useless

03:21.660 --> 03:27.360
I think is I just yeah wander around aimlessly without the right amount of food. I was watching this

03:27.360 --> 03:35.520
doctor talk about ADHD and he was saying how he recommends that people with ADHD when they're working on something keep like a

03:35.520 --> 03:37.080
glass of juice with them

03:37.080 --> 03:42.760
To help their burnt their brain burn better. I guess I don't know I didn't have a glass of juice when I was watching

03:42.760 --> 03:44.760
It so I couldn't really follow what he was saying

03:44.760 --> 03:56.640
It's office hours with Chris

04:01.200 --> 04:07.120
Hey everyone welcome on into the office. Thanks for being here. Hey Brent get comfortable come on in hello

04:07.160 --> 04:12.120
Thank you. You kept my chair nice and warm. I did I kept a little heater on there for you

04:12.120 --> 04:16.640
That's kind of you. You know I also made a little room over there for the mumble room. Hey virtual lug. How's it going?

04:18.040 --> 04:24.020
Hello, hi guys yeah, they're welcome on into the office gosh darn it gosh darn it welcome on in Brent

04:24.020 --> 04:27.840
You're still in North Carolina. I am it seems. I just won't leave now

04:27.840 --> 04:35.400
I'm wondering at this point in time. You're just days away from going tomorrow in fact tomorrow. Okay. I know you I know how things go

04:35.720 --> 04:37.080
I'm wondering

04:37.080 --> 04:42.120
Do you have more projects at this point that are on the list than when you arrived?

04:42.120 --> 04:45.060
And are there more projects undone than done?

04:46.120 --> 04:53.240
Is this a problem so we did have a list uh-huh prior to my arriving which was quite ambitious and

04:53.920 --> 05:00.520
I think maybe Alex should have a look at it because I haven't looked at it in like two weeks

05:00.520 --> 05:08.440
But the number of things we've added I think amounts to the size of the original list as well, so I think you're probably right

05:08.440 --> 05:10.440
I think we have done some amazing things

05:11.080 --> 05:19.040
Alex unfortunately always also is great at starting projects, and then he kind of quickly gets distracted by starting other projects

05:19.040 --> 05:24.220
So we've both been kind of like that and trying to finish projects in the last few days now

05:24.220 --> 05:28.040
Okay, so let me ask you this when you're working on a project normally

05:28.040 --> 05:31.640
All right, would you say this is a problem you have in isolation on your own?

05:31.640 --> 05:34.540
Or would you say this is more of like when you're working with idea guys?

05:34.720 --> 05:39.040
Yeah, you know cuz I've run to this you and I have this too like we could come up with a million projects while you're

05:39.040 --> 05:45.080
Here so is this something that you also do you have this project creep on your own? I didn't expect these

05:45.600 --> 05:52.080
Introspective questions here, but I mean I'm enjoying it. I think I think probably when I'm with you and when I'm with Alex I

05:52.760 --> 05:54.760
take the wonderfully

05:54.760 --> 05:58.200
Natural place for myself, which is like a support role

05:58.200 --> 06:04.280
I was a photographer's assistant for a very long time and so that kind of there's a switch there that just kind of kicks in

06:04.280 --> 06:05.520
so

06:05.520 --> 06:07.920
That doesn't answer your question. I'm just buying myself some time

06:13.480 --> 06:18.800
So I think unfortunately yeah, I probably do lean that way when I'm doing my own stuff at home

06:19.040 --> 06:24.720
So won't want I always just wonder what the solution is to that because I can that can happen to me, too

06:24.720 --> 06:26.320
I think it's a human trait

06:26.320 --> 06:28.040
I mean, it's exciting to start something new

06:28.040 --> 06:32.560
Especially if you're learning some new techniques or trying out some new tool that you have or something like that

06:32.600 --> 06:39.200
But you don't really reap the rewards unless you finish the project. So I don't know a reason why I'm thinking about this is

06:40.520 --> 06:45.040
we're redoing a bunch of back-end stuff to do the JB website and

06:45.840 --> 06:47.160
I

06:47.160 --> 06:49.080
Just kind of recently thought

06:49.080 --> 06:56.520
We probably got to break this up into chunks because it's quickly spinning off into like a new way for us to produce

06:56.840 --> 07:04.160
The back-end source of truth for the shows. It's quickly spinning off into like this, you know new CDN project and

07:04.760 --> 07:08.200
you know, we have a deadline scale engine has been a

07:08.880 --> 07:10.880
fantastic host for like a

07:11.640 --> 07:13.640
decade at least and

07:13.960 --> 07:17.360
They are just kind of not really in the WordPress hosting business anymore

07:17.360 --> 07:23.360
And so they've given us a deadline of summer to get off of scale engine for WordPress

07:23.360 --> 07:25.360
Oh, so they told us a while ago, so we've known it's coming

07:25.840 --> 07:27.840
And so like we have to execute on that

07:29.120 --> 07:34.120
But I don't want to blow it up right and so I've been recently thinking like how do I prevent this project?

07:34.920 --> 07:42.120
Scope creep that I think we're all a little a little kind of inclined towards in our crew

07:42.120 --> 07:47.720
It's so true. That's just been the back of my mind. I feel like we have to do it in a modular way

07:47.720 --> 07:52.840
I'm not sure how to do that because it's all connected. But also we have to keep each other accountable somehow

07:53.640 --> 07:58.560
Yeah, maybe it is like it's not like Trello right Trello like it might be useful for organizing

07:58.560 --> 08:00.840
But that's not what's like gonna make us get the work done

08:01.560 --> 08:05.120
Because as you said there you had a list, but you haven't even looked at it in two weeks. It's true

08:05.120 --> 08:09.240
And every day I'm like, okay, I'm gonna do this today and Alex is like, hey, I was thinking we could do this

08:09.240 --> 08:15.080
Oh, all right. Let's do that. So anyways, it's been a wild ride, which I think maybe that's just it

08:15.080 --> 08:20.100
We're just attracted to adventure. Well, I'm glad you could join me one more time from from North Carolina

08:20.100 --> 08:22.960
I imagine and I understand how it is. You're gonna get back home

08:23.360 --> 08:28.920
You know, you got you'll get you'll get sucked into real life back home again, and we won't see you again for a while

08:28.920 --> 08:33.320
So this has been fun, you know, it's been fun having you in the States and on a high-speed

08:34.280 --> 08:36.280
internet connection while we do the show and

08:36.280 --> 08:40.760
All of that speaking the same language, you know those kinds of things

08:42.680 --> 08:44.680
You know, it's true, all right

08:45.120 --> 08:47.600
All right. Well, I had a little bit of podcasting news

08:47.600 --> 08:52.240
I just wanted to update everybody on how things are going in the industry because this one made me kind of smile

08:52.680 --> 08:54.680
after coming out talking like they were going to

08:55.440 --> 08:57.960
change the podcasting landscape

08:58.880 --> 09:01.040
One of the big tech players has decided

09:01.680 --> 09:04.000
Not for us. We're dropping out of podcasting

09:04.000 --> 09:08.640
It's not what I've complained about because I've honestly never felt like they are much of a threat

09:09.520 --> 09:16.200
But Facebook has announced they are removing all podcasting features from the platform on June 3rd

09:16.200 --> 09:20.560
And they're gonna stop allowing people to add their podcast to the platform

09:21.200 --> 09:27.600
Starting this week as we record the episode. I have to admit I didn't even really realize they had those features

09:28.040 --> 09:32.800
Oops, isn't this kind of actually a sign that this was a good move that right there? Yeah

09:32.800 --> 09:34.800
that's a good time to abandon something when

09:35.160 --> 09:40.640
It's not quite working. I wonder if we aren't gonna go through a bit of a podcast bubble correction

09:40.640 --> 09:44.880
In fact, if I were to speculate I would argue we are already in the midst of it

09:44.880 --> 09:49.800
I think we have been all of this year a bit of a podcasting bubble correction and

09:50.520 --> 09:54.360
the IAB just came out with these ridiculous figures for

09:55.120 --> 09:57.640
Podcast revenue sponsorships, which are just totally unsustainable

09:57.640 --> 10:02.560
So I think we're kind of at the end of a bubble a little bit in sort of the

10:03.280 --> 10:08.080
Industrial side of podcasting where every business needed a strategy. I don't know if we'll see much more

10:09.520 --> 10:12.680
Retractions Facebook just didn't have a lot of establishment here

10:13.240 --> 10:18.880
YouTube is continuing to pay podcasters to move their podcasts over to the YouTube platform

10:18.880 --> 10:22.140
I don't know what they're using to like who they pick

10:22.760 --> 10:26.800
It's all kind of just hush-hush behind the scenes and they have to sign NDAs and stuff

10:26.800 --> 10:29.140
So there's like no real no real dirt out there

10:29.640 --> 10:31.440
Telling us what's going on

10:31.440 --> 10:33.440
but it is I

10:34.120 --> 10:35.560
Guess kind of a bit of a win

10:35.560 --> 10:37.560
It feels like to have Facebook kind of bow out

10:37.840 --> 10:41.920
Doesn't that just sort of feel like one less thing to worry about one giant down, right?

10:42.320 --> 10:48.040
One less pain in my neck, but it was so funny because they can't it was when like right at the at the peak

10:48.040 --> 10:52.840
Hype of Clubhouse. I don't know if you remember this but for a hot minute everybody was talking about Clubhouse. Yes, I do

10:52.840 --> 10:58.880
That's when Facebook announced this whole idea like oh, well, we're gonna become the kings audio audio is a medium

10:58.880 --> 11:01.600
That's grown like crazy and that's when they made all these big plans

11:01.600 --> 11:02.200
You know

11:02.200 --> 11:07.480
You mentioned the bubble kind of maybe starting to come to an end or at least change a little bit and I was I was gonna

11:08.040 --> 11:11.000
Say something that was opposite to you this morning

11:11.000 --> 11:15.720
I ran into I got some gas that I put into Alex's truck and at the gas pump

11:15.720 --> 11:19.200
There was a podcast advertisement on the gas pump and I thought

11:19.200 --> 11:24.720
These are everywhere now. This is just getting ridiculous. Oh, yeah. Okay, I should be clear

11:24.720 --> 11:29.880
I don't mean that podcasts are gonna stop growing and then more and more people aren't gonna do podcasts. I mean, I think

11:31.320 --> 11:33.320
We sort of reached peak

11:34.040 --> 11:39.840
Industrial interest in podcasts like big platform players that want to create the next platform

11:39.840 --> 11:42.800
I think we've got our entrenched players now and

11:44.000 --> 11:47.320
They're gonna try to make money. We'll see a few more consolidations

11:47.320 --> 11:49.920
I I don't think podcasts themselves though. We're gonna stop

11:50.160 --> 11:55.520
this is sort of the magic thing about podcasting and why we're so damn lucky to be doing this form of media is

11:56.520 --> 12:00.080
it just always organically grows because I

12:01.080 --> 12:04.640
think as people we are drawn to just the

12:05.560 --> 12:11.080
Orital medium where we where we tell stories and we help each other process what's going on right now

12:11.800 --> 12:16.420
Through story like it's it's cliche kind of but like it's a virtual campfire thing

12:16.420 --> 12:19.480
where people put the headphones on or they're listening in the car and

12:20.240 --> 12:24.560
It's a more traditional experience. It's being delivered in a new way

12:25.680 --> 12:32.200
but it's it's something that I think is almost built into us and how we share information and how we

12:32.920 --> 12:36.680
figure things out and so I think because it's so accessible and

12:37.480 --> 12:41.120
Because it it seems to touch on something that I think goes deep

12:41.120 --> 12:48.040
I think it's gonna grow forever and I hope I hope I hope I hope now that we're like 15 years into this thing

12:48.800 --> 12:52.240
that certain aspects like RSS feeds and

12:53.640 --> 13:00.840
Just the kind of built-in decentralized nature of the podcast industry. I hope protect it

13:01.520 --> 13:07.840
More than most industries would be protected from consolidation. My only caveat there is

13:07.840 --> 13:14.480
That's exactly what they said about radio back when farmers were using it to broadcast on their fence lines and talk to each other

13:14.480 --> 13:16.480
and give each other crop updates like

13:16.560 --> 13:20.840
Everyone had a radio station. All of the radios frequencies were like stepping on each other

13:21.400 --> 13:25.920
Anybody could do it. It was just a matter of how much how much power could you put out?

13:25.920 --> 13:31.280
And then that you know, obviously that consolidated it got regulated and and it became you know

13:31.280 --> 13:36.200
Something that no one really has access to I don't know if we'll go that far because we're 15 years into it

13:36.200 --> 13:38.200
But like I said, it has happened before

13:38.680 --> 13:44.800
We'll see but it still feels good. Even if it's a small win. We'll take him still feels good. I'll take it

13:44.800 --> 13:46.800
Yeah, I have been

13:47.400 --> 13:48.920
actually sticking

13:48.920 --> 13:54.800
With fountain FM as my podcast app and I I definitely know this has been a struggle for some of our listeners

13:55.160 --> 13:58.640
I've heard from people who tried it so that way they could do the boost things for a bit

13:58.640 --> 14:02.400
But then they didn't really like cast a manic or fountain FM or one of the other new podcast apps

14:02.400 --> 14:08.360
And I also had a little bit of trouble at first. I think for me a couple of the more recent updates

14:08.880 --> 14:10.880
It made a nice improvement

14:11.120 --> 14:14.600
There's a couple of things in here now that I really find useful

14:14.640 --> 14:18.880
The clipping community has kind of become my favorite way to find new podcasts

14:19.640 --> 14:21.080
Have you seen this you've tried this?

14:21.080 --> 14:24.360
Well, you've sent a lot of clips and I've sent clips to you

14:24.360 --> 14:29.040
But also I love in fountain how you open it up and there's you know

14:29.040 --> 14:36.960
The the home page is kind of by default just clips. There have been a few shows that I listened to that I haven't

14:38.120 --> 14:42.440
Maybe hit play on in the last few weeks and then someone throws a clip there and it's like oh, yeah

14:42.440 --> 14:45.120
And you just it's like a you know, the clips can be a various length

14:45.120 --> 14:48.320
So it could be 10 seconds could be 30 seconds could be a few minutes

14:48.320 --> 14:51.200
And I found that to be a really great way to jump into a podcast

14:51.200 --> 14:55.720
I haven't you know heard in a little bit but also like you say to discover new ones, so

14:56.600 --> 14:58.600
it feels like a

14:58.600 --> 15:01.120
cheating almost so at first I

15:01.640 --> 15:05.120
Did not like the clips because I just wanted to get into my podcast

15:05.120 --> 15:09.600
I had a you know, I'm getting on the road. I got a drive. I want to listen to my shows

15:10.200 --> 15:11.360
but

15:11.360 --> 15:18.800
What changed the game for me is when I started realizing I was listening to podcast clips instead of going to YouTube on my phone

15:19.080 --> 15:21.520
Right. Do you understand like how much healthier that is?

15:21.520 --> 15:28.400
Oh, yeah, right. It's so much healthier. Plus I'm discovering new podcasts that have been

15:29.080 --> 15:33.280
Such good listens. So it really changed the way I think about the clip

15:33.280 --> 15:37.840
So now I went like if I got a couple of minutes to kill and I just want to kind of like take a dip

15:37.840 --> 15:38.600
Into some content

15:38.600 --> 15:44.720
I'm firing up fountain and I'm listening to the clips and it has become a network effect because people because as I've shared clips

15:44.960 --> 15:47.760
People have followed me and then I'm following them back

15:47.760 --> 15:51.640
And so now I've got like a little network in there of people that are sharing clips

15:51.640 --> 15:57.280
You wouldn't have to do it use it for that. But man, have I found that stupid handy, you know at first

15:57.280 --> 15:58.860
I didn't want to start over clean

15:58.860 --> 16:03.840
but then having a blank slate and kind of subscribing to like a core few shows that I listened to and

16:04.400 --> 16:12.280
Then adding some new shows based on the clips has kind of like really brightened up my podcast subscriptions again

16:12.280 --> 16:14.920
I'm really enjoying that and plus I have my old app

16:14.920 --> 16:19.040
I can always flip over there and see if I'm missing something so it's not that bad

16:19.040 --> 16:24.760
I found the clip creation process was really neat as well. And I think you have enjoyed it, too

16:24.760 --> 16:28.200
It does like transcripts and you can really get down to it. It's really nice

16:28.520 --> 16:33.520
Yeah, and so you edit it like you would edit text instead of editing in the audio waveform

16:33.520 --> 16:37.400
So you just if you don't want a sentence in there or you want to start at the right point

16:37.400 --> 16:42.120
You just select the text and cut it or whatever and then it creates the audio file

16:42.120 --> 16:47.560
But then it also creates a web link so people don't have to have the fountain app and it'll create an audio file

16:47.560 --> 16:53.760
And it'll export a video that uses the album art and does captions of the transcription is so well done

16:53.760 --> 17:01.160
It's great for sharing like on telegram or matrix or Twitter or whatever. I found it. It has cut way back on my youtube time and

17:02.360 --> 17:08.720
I really like that about it and they've made some solid improvements. The performance has gotten better. The battery life has gotten better

17:08.720 --> 17:12.440
They don't have carplay yet, but they are working on Android auto and carplay

17:12.960 --> 17:18.600
And I do effing love the boost man. I love sending the boosts because as a podcaster

17:18.720 --> 17:22.400
You know, I pay more attention to like a username when I see it on a boost because it sticks out, right?

17:22.400 --> 17:23.720
It's on my screen. I memorize it

17:23.720 --> 17:30.280
And so I hear other people with the same username sometimes boosting the shows and then I'm boosting though. It's it's fun

17:30.280 --> 17:35.720
It is a lot of fun. I still remember sir. Lurks a lot was one of the previous ones. I think last week

17:35.720 --> 17:40.520
Yeah, I gotta remember these is great lurks lots in the mumble right now and I recognized when he John he joined

17:40.520 --> 17:47.560
Oh, I'm like, oh, yeah looks like boosted. That's great. It's great. Yeah, it is pretty good. The other thing is I feel like

17:48.480 --> 17:51.560
Calling them boosts has been pretty astute

17:51.560 --> 17:57.280
You've been mentioning how it's been really boosting your mood recently and some other podcasters mentioned the same thing, right?

17:57.480 --> 18:02.080
Yeah, that is it is a boost. I like it's better than the name of super chat or something like that

18:02.080 --> 18:06.280
Tony wrote in he said so you've convinced me on the future of podcasting 2.0

18:06.760 --> 18:12.120
Value for value and even boosts, but the problem is it assumes that you already have some skin in the crypto game

18:12.120 --> 18:17.960
I've never owned any crypto and I'm looking for a way in it seems that there's plenty of ways to go wrong and likely get

18:17.960 --> 18:19.360
scammed

18:19.360 --> 18:25.680
Good instincts Tony. He says can you recommend a safe starting point for a noob? I'm UK by the way, which is good to know

18:26.280 --> 18:31.120
This is the biggest in my opinion hurdle to the whole boost platform

18:31.120 --> 18:32.480
the

18:32.480 --> 18:34.480
monetary mechanism is

18:34.800 --> 18:37.600
Satoshi's which are a unit of Bitcoin

18:37.720 --> 18:44.520
There's a hundred million Satoshi's in a Bitcoin and so you can send like 500 sats and it's like less than a dollar

18:45.120 --> 18:48.200
To get those you have to buy some sats and you could buy

18:48.360 --> 18:51.780
Tiny amounts of sats at a time you could buy a couple dollars worth of sats at a time

18:52.040 --> 18:57.120
But getting it is tricky in the US. I've been recommending strike

18:57.760 --> 19:00.320
Strike is just a really solid quick app

19:00.320 --> 19:02.040
it is

19:02.040 --> 19:07.880
Regulated it you will have to go through some of the identification processes all of these that are legal and regulated

19:08.240 --> 19:14.240
Have to identify you because it's the rules and regulations of the banking system to prevent many money laundering and you know

19:14.320 --> 19:17.800
Terrorism and stuff like that and all the other things you could probably assume

19:17.920 --> 19:22.600
So you have to go through some form of identification if you use one of these apps, that's the downside

19:23.280 --> 19:25.280
They are used by millions of people though

19:25.280 --> 19:31.040
They are using traditional industry rails to do that kind of regulatory approval and identification

19:31.480 --> 19:38.360
But it is a pain in the butt in the UK. I've been recommending blue wallet, which makes this also really straightforward

19:39.000 --> 19:45.400
What you want is something that participates on the lightning network lightning is kind of like SMTP in the sense that it is an open

19:45.480 --> 19:50.640
protocol it's an open network and you just have to have you know a system on that network and

19:50.640 --> 19:55.200
The benefit to it is that it's peer-to-peer and it's extremely

19:56.120 --> 20:03.720
Stupid cheap to send a monetary amount over that network way cheaper than is possible with something like stripe

20:04.000 --> 20:08.400
Or PayPal or visa or MasterCard way way cheaper, right?

20:08.400 --> 20:15.160
Where you could send fractions of a penny over the lightning network and it's economically feasible to send less than a penny

20:15.480 --> 20:18.560
You can't even send a couple of dollars over the traditional banking network

20:18.560 --> 20:21.000
Without the fee being more than the amount you're sending

20:21.520 --> 20:24.460
So that's why our lightning and boost kind of play a role there

20:24.480 --> 20:27.320
But I I think it's also and I know you already know this Tony

20:27.320 --> 20:32.380
But I think it's also important to point out that there's a network effect of more and more podcasts being on there

20:33.160 --> 20:37.800
Voltage just did a case study of the lightning network and podcasting 2.0

20:37.800 --> 20:41.040
If you can actually believe it or not, and I'll have a link to this in the show notes

20:41.360 --> 20:47.760
There's over a million sats streamed per day. That's not even the boost. That's just people streaming as they listen. Yeah

20:47.760 --> 20:53.040
There is but this is actually even an old number. They say 6.4, but now there's over 7,000 podcasts

20:53.920 --> 20:59.840
Using value for value and lightning when we started talking about this. There was 4,000. That's how fast this is growing

21:00.360 --> 21:03.560
This is a big deal, right? It's not huge in the Linux community

21:04.680 --> 21:11.600
That's where it's not very big but outside of this it is picking up. It's picking up with music artists as well and authors

21:12.240 --> 21:16.400
So voltage did a case study on it and it's absolutely great

21:16.400 --> 21:21.960
It's really bang up. So a link to that. It's starting to grow but podcasting 2.0 itself is

21:22.960 --> 21:25.120
Really more than just the boosts

21:26.120 --> 21:32.600
Podcast and I talked about this in Koda radio recently podcasting 2.0 itself is a set of new standards. It's a spec

21:33.120 --> 21:40.240
It's a whole bunch of new features for podcasting that are really really powerful and you can go look it up the podcasting 2.0 namespace

21:40.560 --> 21:42.160
There's so many great things in there

21:42.160 --> 21:47.280
They solve problems that JB's tried to come up with solutions for for years, but they do it in a standardized open-source way

21:47.280 --> 21:55.200
That an entire community is contributing to and it adds features that not only would make podcasting more accessible to people with accessibility needs

21:55.520 --> 21:59.400
They not only make podcasting easier to find through Google search and stuff like that

22:00.040 --> 22:05.200
But it just adds features that would make the content better as well or make it more accessible

22:05.200 --> 22:09.440
Like we have a question in here about will we ever release office hours as an opus file?

22:09.440 --> 22:17.160
And JB used to release things as an AUG Vorbis an AUG Theora a WebM an MP4

22:17.920 --> 22:20.880
Couple two mp4 types and an mp3

22:20.880 --> 22:28.480
So we had five to six different file versions for every episode and we had to create five or six different RSS feeds

22:28.480 --> 22:35.680
And as a result, if you go searching on places on the web, you can find all these old HD feeds low quality fees

22:35.680 --> 22:40.880
You've probably seen this if you've ever gone around for a little while. Oh, yeah, and it sucks, right? Well, guess what?

22:41.920 --> 22:47.120
One of the things in podcasting 2.0 namespace is a file type enclosure namespace

22:47.520 --> 22:51.440
so you can have multiple file types in one feed entry and the

22:52.080 --> 22:54.080
the software on your phone

22:54.560 --> 22:57.600
Could expose that option so you could choose as a listener

22:57.600 --> 23:03.200
You could choose the opus version of a show or the mp3 version or it would probably default to the mp3 unless you chose

23:03.200 --> 23:06.880
Something different and that could be exposed all via one feed entry

23:07.840 --> 23:09.840
just small little things because

23:10.560 --> 23:16.000
The the reality is is that the podcasting RSS spec hasn't been updated since 2009

23:16.800 --> 23:19.680
It's been a little bit and things have changed

23:20.160 --> 23:24.320
That was well before mobile podcast players had the presence they have now

23:24.880 --> 23:28.720
And it's just it's a whole set of features that I'm as you can tell

23:28.720 --> 23:32.880
super bullish on I just really just I really want to advocate for it because

23:33.920 --> 23:41.920
I think it behooves the podcasters out there to get into this. I think it's it's to the benefit of the medium long term

23:42.560 --> 23:45.840
And sometimes when you work in a medium or when you work in an industry

23:46.320 --> 23:49.040
You have to do things to keep it healthy to keep it going

23:49.120 --> 23:52.800
You can't just sit on your you know existing success and not ever push it forward

23:53.200 --> 23:56.000
That's what I'm a big believer in so that's why I talk about it so much

23:56.000 --> 24:00.160
And I have a link in the show notes to a really good medium post that completely introduces

24:00.640 --> 24:05.360
The entire thing from top to bottom talks about how the podcast index fits into this

24:06.000 --> 24:11.840
How the namespace fits into this it talks about what pod ping is which is one of the really cool features about this

24:11.840 --> 24:13.840
So one of the neat things is

24:13.840 --> 24:15.520
as a publisher

24:15.520 --> 24:17.520
When you publish an episode

24:18.000 --> 24:21.600
You can announce it to the pod ping service and that pod ping service

24:21.600 --> 24:27.760
acts as a store of information that the podcast index in but also all of the podcasting 2.0 apps

24:28.240 --> 24:30.880
participate in so everybody gets a

24:31.760 --> 24:33.280
sensible

24:33.280 --> 24:39.760
Controllable json announcement a basically little json file update that says here's some new feed information new shows out

24:40.160 --> 24:41.680
so instead of

24:41.680 --> 24:44.960
every podcast player and every service having to like

24:45.760 --> 24:47.040
pound an

24:47.040 --> 24:51.600
Http rss file, you know, just an xml file sitting on on an htp share

24:52.160 --> 24:55.520
Instead of having to hit that all the time and and pull it down and see if there's any updates

24:56.320 --> 25:01.360
The pod ping network tells things when stuff when things are updated and it's completely decentralized

25:01.600 --> 25:06.740
It doesn't require the podcast index. Although the podcast index is a front end to it. It doesn't require your specific

25:07.360 --> 25:12.000
Apps implementation. It's a completely open spec and that's part of podcasting 2.0 as well

25:12.640 --> 25:14.160
Without that

25:14.160 --> 25:17.040
You have to rely on services like spotify and apple

25:17.760 --> 25:19.760
To do those kinds of updates for you

25:20.080 --> 25:24.320
And it talks about all that and of course it gets into value value for value

25:24.800 --> 25:26.800
Which is a system?

25:26.880 --> 25:31.600
For podcasters to receive direct payments from listeners for an exchange of value

25:32.240 --> 25:37.200
Either it could be monetary. It could be time. It could be talent. It's you got something out of the show

25:37.200 --> 25:41.120
So you give something back which I think is really in line with the open source esos

25:41.120 --> 25:45.680
And I think ethos and I think something open source developers could embrace too. So I feel like there is

25:46.560 --> 25:53.040
a really solid opportunity to perhaps begin a culture shift in the free software and open source software community to start

25:53.340 --> 25:56.980
Recognizing that the software that they use has real value like mumble. For example

25:57.680 --> 26:02.640
I would absolutely I would absolutely support the mumble developer if I could check a box to stream some sats

26:03.200 --> 26:07.600
You know and when you really start thinking about this like when you really give this actual

26:07.600 --> 26:10.720
Consideration and don't just dismiss what i'm saying when you really think about it

26:11.520 --> 26:14.500
You could you could actually do away with a lot of these foundations

26:15.280 --> 26:22.020
Because at the end of the day these foundations all of these free software projects end up ceding control and copyright to these foundations

26:22.640 --> 26:24.640
Because running a business is a pain in the ass

26:25.680 --> 26:28.240
Asking for money sucks. It's hard

26:29.680 --> 26:31.680
And honestly, they just want to dev

26:32.000 --> 26:34.400
They just want to dev bro. They don't want to be a dev

26:34.400 --> 26:39.600
They just want to dev bro. They don't want to do the business and ask for money and stuff like that

26:39.920 --> 26:46.880
And so they get sucked into these foundations and then these foundations end up centralizing the free software community

26:47.760 --> 26:50.480
And if we solve the monetary problem if we made it possible

26:51.120 --> 26:52.160
using

26:52.160 --> 26:55.920
By the way, all free software an entire free software stack

26:56.640 --> 26:58.560
Where I could check a box in mumble

26:58.560 --> 27:02.800
And it would stream sats from a from a lightning waltz that I have on my umbral node or wherever I have it

27:02.800 --> 27:06.720
And maybe it's a couple of sats a day. Maybe it's 50 sats a day. I mean these are pennies

27:07.440 --> 27:10.480
but at scale for every you know, even if it was 10 every

27:11.200 --> 27:14.400
Every third mumble user. I mean it would really make a difference

27:15.280 --> 27:17.280
And they wouldn't be drawn to these

27:18.380 --> 27:20.380
solutions that ultimately

27:20.720 --> 27:24.400
Five ten years on sort of suck the life out of these projects

27:25.760 --> 27:29.840
At least in my opinion, I mean when you really think about what we could be accomplishing together

27:29.840 --> 27:34.080
We really have an opportunity to improve the life for developers for content creators

27:34.640 --> 27:40.000
And to do it using all free software that's completely decentralized. It's really compelling

27:40.720 --> 27:46.640
So I I do I do really like the value for value aspect of podcasting 2.0 and I think it's intensely important

27:46.960 --> 27:48.960
But it's not the actual entire story

27:49.520 --> 27:51.520
Didn't plan to go on that

27:51.520 --> 27:53.520
rant thank you for it though

27:54.240 --> 27:56.240
I guess I got the feels about it, you know

27:56.240 --> 28:01.040
She's louise. I mean when you get inspired I guess so. Does that make sense to you?

28:01.040 --> 28:06.000
I mean actually I feel like it doesn't because I saw you in the telegram group just the other day asking like hey

28:06.000 --> 28:12.240
What podcast app should I get so it's even even my friends, you know, like we don't think we don't think new podcast

28:12.560 --> 28:19.040
Newpodcastapps.com like I just I haven't like I really haven't gotten the message out there even though and I and I and I know

28:19.040 --> 28:20.320
I could do better

28:20.320 --> 28:23.760
But because I get so passionate about it, I just kind of like go

28:23.760 --> 28:29.120
And i'm clearly not i'm not connecting it, you know, i'm not i'm not getting at home with people

28:29.120 --> 28:33.520
I don't think i'm not as successfully as I could maybe one of my questions for you would be

28:34.080 --> 28:38.160
do you think a someone who's new to podcast could jump into one of these apps and

28:38.960 --> 28:44.160
A year down the road be like, oh, yeah these new features and kind of grow with the app

28:44.160 --> 28:47.840
Is that a do you think they're appropriate for that? I think some of the features

28:49.040 --> 28:52.400
If you showed it to a new user, they would just be like, oh, yeah

28:52.400 --> 28:56.080
If you showed it to a new user, they would just think the feature should have always been like that like chapters

28:56.720 --> 29:01.700
Or like the ability to show an image up on the screen at a moment during the show or transcripts

29:02.320 --> 29:07.120
or the other thing you could do with that multi-format enclosure is you could have a low bit rate high bit rate and

29:07.600 --> 29:12.420
An app developer could choose to implement the ability when streaming to dynamically switch depending on your connectivity

29:13.120 --> 29:17.840
That's just something youtube does automatically a new user to a new podcast app would just expect that kind of thing

29:17.840 --> 29:20.320
They wouldn't even know any different. In fact, I think it's harder

29:20.320 --> 29:26.320
I think the real challenge is people who love antenna pod and overcast and pocketcast because those apps

29:27.040 --> 29:28.720
Have let people develop

29:28.720 --> 29:29.840
routines

29:29.840 --> 29:36.080
And a process and a way of listening that new apps don't necessarily re-implement because they got their whole they got their own whole paradigm

29:36.160 --> 29:37.680
And I think it's much harder

29:37.680 --> 29:43.360
For those users to stick than it would be a new user who doesn't really have expectations of what an app does. Is that grog?

29:43.520 --> 29:45.360
Oh, yeah

29:45.360 --> 29:47.600
That's my thing on that. I guess that's my thing

29:47.600 --> 29:53.680
I like it, you know, you know how I get when I get when I gets to talking about the podcasting. Yeah, you love the podcasting

29:53.920 --> 30:01.600
It's really exciting. Honestly, what's going on over there? I listen to the podcasting 2.0 podcast, you know that dave and adam do

30:02.160 --> 30:07.120
There's so many developers and community members that are all working on pieces of it right now

30:07.440 --> 30:08.720
There's so many things in the work

30:08.720 --> 30:14.080
So it is early days and that's another thing I suck at is I can't just keep my mouth shut and let

30:14.320 --> 30:16.400
The early day stuff ride out for a little bit longer

30:16.400 --> 30:22.080
You know, I got to be out there doing a podcast like two years or in the case of bitcoin like 13 years before anybody

30:22.080 --> 30:26.320
Cares about it, right? I got to be like out there. Mr. Early adopter not in a bragging way

30:26.320 --> 30:30.160
No, no, not in a breaking way like in a shut up and be strategic you moron way

30:30.400 --> 30:34.400
Why aren't you a better businessman way that kind of way, you know, that's how I feel. Anyways

30:34.960 --> 30:36.160
moving on

30:36.160 --> 30:39.600
The github interaction on the website stuff. Oh, wow

30:40.240 --> 30:44.800
Right. Oh, wow. Yeah, how good it's super great. Yeah

30:44.800 --> 30:48.240
Thank you. Everyone really so we have been reading it

30:49.120 --> 30:53.120
we have been conversating around it and trying to figure out like

30:53.760 --> 30:58.000
What makes sense what resonates with us how we want to kind of break this thing into multiple phases?

30:58.720 --> 31:01.200
So I asked west to come into my office earlier

31:02.480 --> 31:06.480
And i've kind of decided like let's take let's sit down and kind of take a look at what we do know

31:06.480 --> 31:15.040
And what we don't know where we're at. And so that was sort of the framing for our conversation around the website

31:30.080 --> 31:35.680
Wes pains back here in the office with me wes welcome into the office. Thank you. You even brought a chair in

31:35.680 --> 31:39.040
I mean, there's not much room. You're kind of standing over me, but it works

31:39.280 --> 31:44.000
Yeah, brent wanted me to only have a stool but I decided you deserved a nice comfy chair because after all

31:44.400 --> 31:47.040
You're basically the cto of our summer projects here

31:47.040 --> 31:48.240
You get you know

31:48.240 --> 31:52.560
You get full veto power as far as i'm concerned on anything before we deploy it

31:52.800 --> 31:55.760
and I feel like we're kind of coming to a bit of a

31:56.240 --> 32:03.520
Firm understanding of what we know we are going to bite off and tackle this summer. Yeah, that was kind of mission one

32:03.520 --> 32:09.440
We got stuck with this. Hey change up the website, but we started thinking about it. And you know, the website is really just

32:10.240 --> 32:14.800
one output of many that we have and they all the outputs kind of stem from

32:15.280 --> 32:18.400
you know, whatever we use as our source of truth and so

32:19.280 --> 32:24.640
Making changes to the website is one thing but we got to kind of factor in how does that affect everything upstream and

32:24.960 --> 32:27.520
potentially downstream of it and sort of pick

32:27.520 --> 32:34.560
Of the pieces of automation because it's not just the website, right? We've got some existing automation around publishing the episodes taking

32:34.560 --> 32:40.000
you know going from the editor's great output and putting it in all the right places where the audience can reach it and

32:40.720 --> 32:44.560
What parts of those do we want to commit to changing?

32:44.880 --> 32:49.600
To facilitate whatever the next stage of the website is and then what other changes does it make sense to do?

32:49.760 --> 32:55.200
At that same time and are there some things that make sense to hold off just for a little bit

32:55.200 --> 32:58.880
so that way we can kind of keep this in a reasonable set of goals because

32:59.680 --> 33:03.440
We could pretty easily spin off into building a totally new

33:03.920 --> 33:08.960
Complex monster that would like address all of our workflow issues we've ever had and that would be wonderful

33:09.280 --> 33:13.280
But we don't really need to do it all at once and we do have like an actual deadline to get the you know

33:13.280 --> 33:19.600
To accomplish the website component and I think there's still like shows to record too. Yeah, there's that so we've kind of figured out

33:19.840 --> 33:24.320
It seems like for phase one. We're probably going to keep fireside as our back end cdn

33:24.320 --> 33:29.920
And and what we're calling sort of our source of truth for the most part at least what goes public?

33:29.920 --> 33:36.480
What do we mean by source of truth one place to collect all the information about the show that defines a defines an episode, you know

33:36.480 --> 33:42.880
So that's that starts with things like the title the description the set of tags associated with it includes the links it includes

33:43.360 --> 33:47.680
Information about who sponsored that show if any it includes the hosts the guests

33:48.000 --> 33:52.720
It might include something like a transcript in the future, you know, so there's one spot to go

33:52.720 --> 33:58.800
To modify things to make changes to find the reference for that episode and one one place of data that then can feed

33:59.040 --> 34:01.440
Any other system that needs to take it and you know

34:01.600 --> 34:07.520
Translate it into whether that be translated to the feed translate it to some markdown for a website engine

34:08.160 --> 34:12.000
Or something else you can probably imagine listener happens all the time

34:12.240 --> 34:16.800
Like we get an episode out there like oh, we forgot a link or oh this link needs to be changed

34:17.120 --> 34:20.160
We should have this person's name to the guest list stuff like that happens

34:20.160 --> 34:25.120
And so you want like a source of truth that the editors and the hosts and everybody else on the team

34:25.600 --> 34:29.680
Knows that's where they go to make changes. So we're going to kind of use fireside as that right now

34:30.240 --> 34:33.040
But we're going to lay our own website on top of that

34:33.440 --> 34:38.480
And then the other bit that's pretty important for us to work with the podcasting 2.0 spec

34:39.040 --> 34:45.440
Is we're going to start biting off generating our own rss feeds, which so far we've kind of been reluctant to ever really take on

34:45.440 --> 34:50.640
Well, you know, we messed that up and people can't listen to the shows we're off the air. So that's a big deal

34:50.640 --> 34:52.640
But we also want like you said we want

34:53.040 --> 34:57.120
Enclosure option support we want transcript support. We want to improve chapter support

34:57.120 --> 35:02.320
There's so many things in the 2.0 spec that we want to be able to work into this and to do that

35:02.880 --> 35:08.640
We have to just sort of manage the feeds ourselves because we find that the platforms out there that generate these feeds for you

35:08.960 --> 35:12.000
While they're nice and reliable and they have good cdns and all that kind of stuff

35:12.000 --> 35:16.240
They're not really aggressive about adding these features. We have a more advanced audience

35:16.800 --> 35:21.520
That's a little bit more of an earth. Well, not a little bit that is, you know, a lot of early adopters

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
And so they want these features

35:24.320 --> 35:29.360
Before other podcast audiences are demanding them. Maybe that's because sort of underscores a lot of what we're doing actually

35:30.320 --> 35:31.360
I think we're you know

35:31.360 --> 35:35.600
Partially realizing that that some of this stuff being able to have the feed, you know

35:35.760 --> 35:38.480
That that meets the audience's needs that meets our needs

35:38.480 --> 35:42.800
We're not just making a podcast. We're pretty committed to the podcasting medium, right?

35:42.800 --> 35:46.160
It's kind of the primary output that we have we have other outputs sure, you know

35:46.160 --> 35:52.720
Like we have the videos on youtube and stuff like that, but the feeds that's that's the heart of jupiter broadcasting in many ways

35:53.040 --> 35:58.320
Yep, so we want to make sure we get that right. So we figured out feeds. We're going to generate a new website

35:58.640 --> 36:02.560
It's going to be a static website. We're going to take that on a new live page all the sort of

36:03.440 --> 36:05.440
accessory side pages and stuff like that

36:05.440 --> 36:08.960
page all the sort of accessory side pages like

36:09.520 --> 36:13.120
You know the calendar page the donation page matrix info mumble info

36:13.440 --> 36:17.840
We're going to try to make it pretty straightforward to create pages that won't have to be updated too often

36:17.920 --> 36:23.200
But will hopefully be high performance and and and load fast for you and look clean

36:23.520 --> 36:29.680
We have that kind of stuff dialed in and we kind of have a high level of requirements figured out to support all of that

36:30.720 --> 36:31.040
You know

36:31.040 --> 36:33.040
You've been thinking a little bit too about a more modern

36:33.040 --> 36:39.360
publishing workflow about a new way we could host this because what we're transitioning from today is a wordpress site

36:39.920 --> 36:42.320
That runs on scale engine and it's been good

36:42.400 --> 36:48.560
But it really was a different way of running this stuff and there's kind of a more modern way to architect this few years ago

36:48.560 --> 36:53.920
We were manually adding posts to the wordpress every time an episode came out, right and that's very flexible

36:53.920 --> 36:57.360
It means like, you know you as a as a small business person like you have complete control

36:57.360 --> 37:00.800
You don't have to learn a whole crazy system. It's it's designed around interactivity

37:00.800 --> 37:03.440
But when we switch to a more automated workflow

37:04.140 --> 37:08.800
Interactivity was less of our concern instead of you know automation and reproducibility. Yeah

37:09.760 --> 37:12.880
And and really just the ability to just do things at scale

37:13.360 --> 37:18.560
There's really no reason why an episode needs to sit around and wait for somebody to go through and create a wordpress post

37:18.800 --> 37:21.040
After an editor's done that's what we realized a while ago

37:21.360 --> 37:24.240
And we set off to fix that with our cast a blast to back end

37:24.560 --> 37:27.360
And that's been now that's really carried us a long way

37:27.360 --> 37:32.960
And this is kind of completing that and you have invested west in back end infrastructure to help automate some of this stuff

37:33.200 --> 37:37.200
Where do you think? Where do you think? We're really going to be adding to our existing system. Is it going to be

37:37.680 --> 37:43.520
Employing things on github more like where do you think one of the big tweaks is going to be in our in our back end infrastructure?

37:44.000 --> 37:44.720
Yeah for the moment

37:44.720 --> 37:48.480
We've kind of got a you know a collection of automations that tie together primarily

37:48.800 --> 37:54.400
Closed systems, right? Like we can't give the audience access to the wordpress. We're not going to give them access to the fireside

37:54.400 --> 37:58.260
Unfortunately, so those are all kind of just closed off pieces that we you know

37:58.340 --> 38:02.900
We've got credentials to we join these apis together and shuffle data around but in the future

38:03.060 --> 38:09.300
We'd absolutely love to have more things available on github both for you know collaboration reasons internally

38:09.300 --> 38:11.460
But also externally with the audience to share, you know

38:11.700 --> 38:17.380
We're not going to be experts in all the tools we use we we know already the audience has a ton of great opinions say on

38:17.860 --> 38:19.860
static site builders and so if we can

38:19.860 --> 38:23.540
You know publish the stuff that we're doing and get some some help or input from the audience on

38:23.540 --> 38:25.940
On tweaking the website to be as cool as possible

38:26.420 --> 38:30.180
I think that's a great idea and we're not going to get totally there in phase one

38:30.580 --> 38:36.100
I'd love to see us keep our source of truth on github as well, but there's some complications especially like

38:36.980 --> 38:38.980
We have a sort of you know time sensitive

38:39.200 --> 38:43.700
Scheduling workflow sometimes where we we need an episode to come out at a certain time, but not before

38:44.180 --> 38:47.940
We've got you know restrictions on necessarily who might have access to things

38:48.580 --> 38:49.860
when

38:49.860 --> 38:52.820
And we rely on fireside for some of those things right now

38:52.820 --> 38:54.820
But in the future

38:55.220 --> 39:00.740
I think we can change that we just got to pick off the right size chunks so that we can actually accomplish these things

39:00.740 --> 39:02.580
And not totally break

39:02.580 --> 39:04.580
everything

39:04.660 --> 39:10.980
The github conversation and discussions have been really useful for kind of thinking through some of that and that's just it

39:10.980 --> 39:14.500
You know, there's it's sort of a nice way to kind of move through this and figure. Okay

39:14.500 --> 39:18.340
Yeah, we have to have this like we as we started whiteboarding this out. We realized

39:18.340 --> 39:25.560
Scheduling the publishing is actually a little bit more of a complicated problem that we initially thought and that's one of the one of the ways

39:25.560 --> 39:31.240
Keeping fireside as our source of truth solves that because it has a mechanism built in for scheduling

39:31.560 --> 39:36.120
but what we really like about eventually moving the entire workflow to github and we think we have ways we could do it is

39:36.680 --> 39:41.720
That's where we could eventually bring in the audience and somebody could do a pull request against show notes

39:42.040 --> 39:45.000
and either make an addition or a subtraction or a correction and

39:45.000 --> 39:51.400
Not only would that be powerful around the you know, the the week that the episode comes out, but imagine

39:51.960 --> 39:54.760
somebody's listening to an episode five years from now and

39:55.320 --> 39:58.440
There's a bad link or something's dead in the show notes

39:58.920 --> 40:02.600
They could help us keep that as a living relevant document

40:02.600 --> 40:07.400
That's still useful to people even stuff that's in the back catalog that we would never go back through an audit anymore

40:07.640 --> 40:12.360
So I guess what I'm saying is we have motivations and reasons to take it beyond what we want to do in phase one

40:12.360 --> 40:16.680
It just seems like we have to be reasonable about what we choose to bite off at this stage

40:16.680 --> 40:21.880
Yeah, you know, we're trying to find our squeakiest wheels and right now that's the website and then the feeds

40:22.200 --> 40:25.800
It's just so core and you know, it kind of makes sense to you because the data is quite similar

40:25.800 --> 40:28.440
It's both very driven on on the shows and the episode

40:28.440 --> 40:33.320
So we need the same a lot of the same data for the feeds as we end up needing for the website

40:33.320 --> 40:39.960
So I think I think there's going to be some nice combination there where we can get two birds one stone and a whole lot of podcasts

40:39.960 --> 40:43.240
Very good. Well, thank you. Mr. Payne. Thanks for coming to the office and going over this

40:43.240 --> 40:48.920
We press on and it's gonna just get better and better and the summer is gonna be exciting looking forward to it

40:48.920 --> 41:09.640
All right. Now you get back to work. Wait, you're supposed to give me that expense card. I'm sorry. You got to go now

41:12.280 --> 41:16.520
All right, so I actually kind of wanted to do something a little different for the boost segments

41:16.520 --> 41:22.600
If you want to share your story lurks a lot, but you told me in the matrix room the other day and I love these stories about how

41:23.320 --> 41:27.160
You decided to take the challenge and figure out how to do the boost thing

41:27.640 --> 41:33.400
Which has now sent you down the rabbit hole of self-hosting and running an umbral instance and all that kind of stuff

41:34.600 --> 41:37.800
I mean, what do you what do you uh, what do you want to share?

41:37.800 --> 41:40.520
I mean, I don't want to put you on the spot, but i'd love to hear a little bit of the story

41:41.160 --> 41:45.320
Wanting to do more self-hosting was something I want to do. Anyway, I just like to learn

41:45.320 --> 41:51.240
And play with the stuff and you know, I don't know i'm an enthusiast always have been but

41:52.200 --> 41:56.920
It's really just been all of this talk about the podcasting 2.0 and the value for value

41:57.320 --> 41:59.400
just kind of really piqued my interest because

42:00.360 --> 42:01.960
for me, um

42:01.960 --> 42:05.480
The main appeal of bitcoin has never been this whole like speculative

42:05.560 --> 42:10.600
Oh if I buy a little and hodl it and i'll be so rich kind of thing that draws a lot of people in

42:11.000 --> 42:13.160
um, I like kind of more the uh

42:13.160 --> 42:19.800
What do you call it? The um, the idealism behind it of enabling people to do things and giving people

42:19.880 --> 42:25.400
You know like a decentralized kind of you know, consensus based system for money. I like that a lot

42:25.720 --> 42:33.160
Yeah, you know for me. It was the decentralized network the the shared computing thing. I've always loved

42:33.880 --> 42:39.400
Clustered computing especially clustered computing over the internet and that's what drew me into it as well

42:39.400 --> 42:44.280
As well, but i'm wondering if if you kind of got these this sensation I did

42:45.240 --> 42:50.360
Which was really kind of a cool sensation was when I first self-hosted a service I felt

42:51.000 --> 42:57.240
It felt good. Like I had taken control of something and a term that gets used often is like I had sovereignty over it

42:58.120 --> 42:59.880
It was cool to have that feeling with my data

42:59.880 --> 43:04.600
It was a whole other experience to have it with money to be like

43:05.080 --> 43:07.160
I don't have to go to paypal to ask for this money

43:07.160 --> 43:11.480
I don't have to go to stripe to ask for this money. I don't have to go for the bank to the bank when somebody

43:11.560 --> 43:13.080
boosts the show

43:13.080 --> 43:18.040
It shows up on the note in my office here at the studio and it's physically like there

43:18.200 --> 43:24.120
It's really like it's like having a register and it's actually mine. It's we have sovereignty over it

43:24.680 --> 43:27.800
And that is such a it's such a hard concept to convey

43:28.360 --> 43:32.760
But it's one of those things like self-hosting that when once you feel it you love that sensation

43:32.760 --> 43:35.640
So you're getting both at the same time right now. It's pretty great

43:35.640 --> 43:37.640
So what are you going to try experimenting with?

43:37.880 --> 43:42.920
well right now i'm really kind of learning a lot about the lightning network and stuff and so

43:43.400 --> 43:45.400
um, I do have this excitement about

43:46.020 --> 43:51.080
Participating helping keep the network healthy and running a bitcoin in the lightning node

43:51.320 --> 43:55.960
But like i'm not set up for routing man. This channel stuff is hard to figure out with the lightning

43:56.840 --> 44:02.440
Yeah, yeah, it is. There are some good resources out there including some good youtube videos

44:02.440 --> 44:06.120
I'll try to find a couple and throw them in the show notes if I remember after the show because there's some good ways

44:06.120 --> 44:07.480
To get started there

44:07.480 --> 44:09.480
But that is it is a complicated thing

44:09.960 --> 44:13.880
It is legitimately probably just as complicated as running an email server. I mean it is

44:14.680 --> 44:17.640
it is not for the faint of heart what you asked me about like

44:18.760 --> 44:22.200
That sensation that you get once you self-host something for me

44:22.280 --> 44:25.880
Like the first thing is I went ahead despite everybody's advice

44:26.280 --> 44:29.960
Which is which is actually kind of spot on and i'm hosted my own email

44:29.960 --> 44:35.880
And i'm still doing it because I still like it and uh, then the big one for me was when I got my family

44:35.960 --> 44:39.960
To switch to my own matrix server and now my whole family

44:39.960 --> 44:45.640
We have our own pet and it just feels good to not be on google's hangouts or anything else like it

44:46.420 --> 44:48.360
Congratulations on that

44:48.360 --> 44:50.360
That is awesome, man. Well done

44:51.240 --> 44:53.240
That is that is a big win right there

44:53.720 --> 44:55.560
Uh, well, thanks for sharing

44:55.560 --> 45:00.280
Uh, I appreciate you, uh coming on and hanging out in the office for a few minutes and I want to uh

45:00.760 --> 45:02.760
switch over to you now brent because

45:03.240 --> 45:07.480
You were setting up your own node this last week because one of the things we want to experiment

45:08.440 --> 45:10.280
with office hours

45:10.280 --> 45:13.560
Is in the podcasting 2.0 spec for the value

45:14.500 --> 45:17.400
Um namespace the value element or whatever you want to call it

45:18.440 --> 45:20.200
they have this

45:20.200 --> 45:22.200
concept of splits

45:22.200 --> 45:28.520
And the idea with the split is and if you go look at the podcasting 2.0 show, in fact

45:28.520 --> 45:33.720
Let's go pull it up right now on the on the website. If you go look over there. You'll see they have these splits between

45:34.840 --> 45:36.520
a bunch of participants

45:36.520 --> 45:37.880
in the show

45:37.880 --> 45:40.840
This is like an automatic way so that when people send in boosts

45:41.240 --> 45:44.520
You can set splits to go to the host to the producer to the editor

45:45.080 --> 45:50.680
So so here on the podcasting 2.0 show, which is the weekly show that talks about the work going on

45:50.680 --> 45:53.720
They have most of the split going to the podcast index

45:54.200 --> 45:57.480
Then they have some of their split going to their chapters editor

45:57.960 --> 46:02.760
Another bit of the split going to sovereign feeds. That's how they generate their podcasting 2.0 feed

46:03.480 --> 46:07.400
And then they have a couple of really small sats going to the boostagram bots

46:07.800 --> 46:10.040
Because those if you send them one sat they can help like

46:11.000 --> 46:15.960
Announce on mastodon or in a chat room that you've got in a boost. So they kind of also play with that a little bit

46:16.760 --> 46:18.760
But one of the ideas here of these splits

46:18.760 --> 46:25.560
Is in the podcasting 2.0 app when you go to send a boost you can actually see how the podcast

46:25.880 --> 46:29.880
Has decided to arrange those splits and in some cases you could even override them

46:30.440 --> 46:36.760
But the thought is is that it's a way to send value to the individuals who are contributing value to the podcast

46:36.920 --> 46:38.920
On an ongoing basis so

46:38.920 --> 46:41.160
And you can do it per episode or you can do it for the entire feed

46:41.160 --> 46:44.360
So you could say automatically on the episodes that brent participates in

46:44.360 --> 46:49.880
Participates in there is a split added to hit to the rss feed for office hours

46:50.360 --> 46:53.880
Where brent gets 10 of all of the boosts for the show?

46:54.440 --> 46:59.640
Another idea i'm experimenting with along these same lines for coder radio and for lup

47:00.680 --> 47:03.480
Is why not send a split to an open source project?

47:04.200 --> 47:06.120
You send a boost into the show

47:06.120 --> 47:08.680
10 that week for that episode goes to

47:09.480 --> 47:12.440
I don't know the mumble developer. Let's just i'm I guess i'm picking on mumble, right?

47:12.440 --> 47:16.600
They have to be on the lightning network. So i'm collecting a list. So if you know of any send me a boost

47:17.560 --> 47:18.680
Then you know

47:18.680 --> 47:21.640
It's like a way where you can boost the show and like 10

47:22.360 --> 47:25.400
That week goes to a project or something or in this case, you know

47:25.480 --> 47:28.760
10 goes to brent and 10 goes to drew and you know

47:28.760 --> 47:31.720
We kind of or something right? Like I don't actually know what it would look like

47:31.800 --> 47:36.600
But what I find appealing about it as a longtime podcaster is it's all transparent

47:37.080 --> 47:40.600
It's all front and center and it's a way for the audience to kind of

47:40.600 --> 47:42.600
directly

47:43.260 --> 47:47.740
Give value to like say maybe just maybe the week we're doing like brent gets the split or something

47:47.740 --> 47:50.380
Like you are a brent fan and you think he's been doing great work

47:51.020 --> 47:54.140
You know, it's just an opportunity. I I feel like there's something there

47:54.220 --> 47:59.660
So I said brent go set up a lightning node have at it. Let's try this out. Hoorah

48:00.140 --> 48:03.660
How'd it go? You're pretty smart because you told me several days ago and I think

48:04.460 --> 48:06.380
With the experience we had in january setting yours up

48:06.380 --> 48:12.460
It takes a few days to download the whole blockchain on your node. Yeah, and you do that ahead of time

48:12.540 --> 48:19.180
So I got to it. Thank you to alex for getting me into ansible a little bit. So I took the opportunity to jump in

48:20.220 --> 48:23.740
do a little bit of ansible foo to get this thing up and running which is a

48:24.380 --> 48:27.420
I guess a whole other story that we told in linux unplugged this week

48:27.580 --> 48:30.940
but it was going great once I sort of figured it out and um

48:30.940 --> 48:39.740
I learned the challenge of having several sysadmins sitting on the same server because it turns out alex is doing a bunch of

48:39.820 --> 48:46.860
Experiments and he rebooted the server which actually I guess the node never came back up. So for about a half a day yesterday

48:48.140 --> 48:50.700
We were not downloading the blockchain. So i'm a little behind

48:51.100 --> 48:58.060
On downloading it but um, I think it's gonna work just fine once it gets going and uh, unfortunately

48:58.060 --> 49:01.020
We don't have it up and running at this very moment, but I feel like after the show

49:01.020 --> 49:02.940
Maybe we can uh start playing with it

49:02.940 --> 49:05.580
This might be one of those giving the milk away for free moments

49:05.580 --> 49:10.060
But there's like a vps that focuses just on lightning nodes called voltage. Oh

49:11.500 --> 49:12.780
And you can

49:12.780 --> 49:14.780
Basically go there depending on how much you want to pay

49:15.180 --> 49:20.460
And they have some pretty cheap plans for individuals and they run a hosted node for you. See that's a great idea

49:20.940 --> 49:22.940
I think that's really attractive actually

49:23.100 --> 49:25.100
That might be like for the hosts

49:25.100 --> 49:30.060
That don't want to run their own node, which should probably be the majority that seems like a pretty nice way to go

49:30.140 --> 49:31.100
but then

49:31.100 --> 49:38.220
the hosts that do want to run their own node have that option and then and i've never used any of these hosted services, but

49:38.920 --> 49:40.920
understanding the way the technology works

49:41.100 --> 49:44.540
You absolutely could sort of use the hosted node as your front end

49:44.700 --> 49:49.020
And then the wallet could possibly be like on an umbral box on your land or something like that, too

49:49.580 --> 49:51.580
So that's kind of fun and cool

49:51.660 --> 49:53.660
so there's again

49:53.660 --> 49:56.940
A lot of work that still needs to be done, but you can feel we're getting there, right?

49:57.020 --> 49:59.340
Like there's progress made almost every single week

50:00.220 --> 50:01.980
People are trying it out

50:01.980 --> 50:04.140
I'm trying to find the right balance and how to talk about it

50:04.700 --> 50:06.380
You know that kind of stuff

50:06.380 --> 50:06.620
well

50:06.620 --> 50:08.940
And it feels like this show is an appropriate place to just kind of

50:09.260 --> 50:13.100
Throw all caution out the window and just try these things. So bring it on. Yep

50:13.420 --> 50:15.420
So we will be trying that out eventually

50:15.740 --> 50:20.460
Probably the first show where we experiment with taking over our own feed generation is going to be this one

50:20.460 --> 50:25.340
And the other benefit to doing that is then the members will be able to boost as well

50:25.900 --> 50:29.820
Because right now our core problem is that the platforms we use don't support the value tag

50:30.140 --> 50:35.180
And so the member feeds don't support it and on the daily I hear from a member who's like I'd really like to send you

50:35.180 --> 50:38.700
A boost it's like the most requested feature right now. Yeah. Yeah

50:39.500 --> 50:41.180
Speaking of boosts

50:41.180 --> 50:46.940
Dpg sent a boost in two days ago says he's loving the office. He wants to know about our support for codecs

50:46.940 --> 50:51.820
I mentioned this earlier. He's asking about google's lira and also just about opus in general

50:52.140 --> 50:54.860
Or are we going to be stuck with mp3 forever?

50:55.740 --> 51:03.260
You know, I think momentum on these alternative codecs was lost when at the when the patent expired or whatever it was on mp3

51:03.820 --> 51:06.460
Years ago now and momentum was just kind of lost

51:07.100 --> 51:11.660
Opus is probably personally for me the most appealing on that list there

51:11.660 --> 51:16.060
If you could point me in the direction of a couple of podcast apps, I could test with opus

51:16.540 --> 51:21.820
It's not beyond the scope of something i'd be willing to consider once we get a 2.0 compliant rss feed

51:22.220 --> 51:27.020
because over the years i've probably gotten a couple of hundred requests for opus and

51:27.980 --> 51:31.820
That's one of the benefits to joining the mumble room is you get the opus codec

51:31.820 --> 51:36.300
Which we have turned up to like 96 kilobits or something like that. It just sounds fantastic at 96

51:37.180 --> 51:39.500
So maybe maybe maybe

51:39.500 --> 51:41.500
Maybe maybe

51:41.500 --> 51:45.740
True grits wrote in with a thousand sats. I would be fine listening to normal jb content

51:45.740 --> 51:51.020
They write ads and everything if I could just get the unplugged live stream boosts enabled. There you go

51:51.180 --> 51:53.180
Plus one for that feature request

51:53.340 --> 51:55.340
I know man. I know

51:55.500 --> 51:58.060
I know we're getting there. It's just not that simple it is

51:58.780 --> 52:03.900
It requires the building of our own entire infrastructure to do it, but we will get there one day, right?

52:04.140 --> 52:07.420
Which we will thank you for pushing us in that direction, but there's work to be done

52:07.420 --> 52:10.060
It's definitely gotten the conversations really going

52:10.620 --> 52:10.940
All right

52:10.940 --> 52:14.860
Thank you everybody for sending a boost if you'd like to boost us do podcast apps dot com

52:15.260 --> 52:20.780
And I like the blue wallet if you're outside the us and strike if you're inside the us to charge it up

52:21.180 --> 52:24.940
Now we got an email into the show about matrix and things

52:25.340 --> 52:31.180
It says hi chris longtime listener for just about all your shows and i'm an occasional participant in the telegram group

52:31.900 --> 52:36.300
I've been listening to you talk about matrix for quite some time now and i've messed with it on and off over the years

52:36.300 --> 52:39.500
As well i've had high hopes for matrix and perhaps it will work out

52:39.580 --> 52:43.980
But I do wonder if your attention on it is sucking all of the oxygen out of the room

52:44.220 --> 52:48.540
Perhaps there are other technologies which could be even better that are not getting the spotlight

52:49.100 --> 52:54.640
You've been a big advocate for decentralized and self-hosted options. But what about distributed and serverless?

52:55.340 --> 52:57.340
Could perhaps that not be even better?

52:57.740 --> 53:03.820
Think no synapse to even have to manage that's attractive. Yeah, really projects like talks

53:03.820 --> 53:10.540
Session jammy, they're foss and they aim to do the core of what matrix is doing but without the need for any servers at all

53:11.340 --> 53:16.540
I know matrix is a bit more ambitious, but perhaps it's aiming to do more than what people really need just food for thought

53:16.620 --> 53:19.740
Thanks for all you do. That's a great solid question right there and

53:20.540 --> 53:25.180
I'll tell you I have thought sometimes would would actually look something like matter most almost be better

53:25.820 --> 53:30.300
For what we're trying to do, you know, we want to have a place for our community to come together

53:30.300 --> 53:38.380
That has discussion channels essentially for each show and for other topics like bitcoin or

53:38.940 --> 53:44.620
Nicks and you know just stuff that maybe isn't particularly for one show but something our community still kind of follows or at least some

53:44.620 --> 53:48.300
Of our community, but maybe not all of them. So we don't want it in the main room that kind of stuff

53:49.420 --> 53:51.100
and um

53:51.100 --> 53:57.260
You know, obviously discord has been heavily heavily heavily considered as well as just sticking with irc

53:57.260 --> 54:03.900
But I think ultimately what draws us back to matrix is two key factors

54:05.180 --> 54:06.620
number one

54:06.620 --> 54:07.660
is

54:07.660 --> 54:14.460
The federated nature means that it allows our audience to scratch that self-hosting itch if they want but still participate in our community

54:14.780 --> 54:16.780
Which is really cool

54:16.780 --> 54:21.900
Uh, it also means that they could just join matrix.org if they like because right now we have registrations closed on ours

54:21.900 --> 54:28.060
So that's a factor but what really has drawn me personally and and probably why i'm talking about it more is

54:28.620 --> 54:32.940
More and more and more free software projects are making that their community

54:33.900 --> 54:39.500
And so i'm in a red hat room. I'm in a gnome room. I'm in a plasma kde room, right?

54:39.500 --> 54:45.980
I'm in a security and an open source radical thinkers room. I'm I i'm in an accessibility room

54:45.980 --> 54:49.980
That's trying to do accessibility for gtk stuff and i'm i'm in a room for people that are trying to do

54:49.980 --> 54:53.340
Outreach for people that are you know for groups that aren't really in open source yet

54:53.340 --> 54:57.180
And they're trying to bring new people in and it's like all of these diverse

54:58.380 --> 55:01.820
Opinions and rooms all on one giant network

55:02.620 --> 55:06.620
And I can join as chris at jupiter broadcasting.com, right? So it's like

55:07.420 --> 55:12.060
Or chris last whatever. I think it's just chris. So it's like it has that identity aspect to it

55:12.220 --> 55:16.540
It has that network effect to it. It has that self-hosting element to it

55:16.540 --> 55:21.820
It has this sort of feeling like this is going somewhere like the trend line is in the right direction as well

55:21.820 --> 55:26.300
Which is usually when I start adopting something as an early adopter i'm like, okay, it's early

55:26.300 --> 55:29.580
But I like the direction of that trend line and that's when I get on board

55:30.140 --> 55:33.420
But that's not to take away from all the other stuff you mentioned or the stuff. I just mentioned

55:34.140 --> 55:36.620
It may end up ultimately not being the best decision

55:36.940 --> 55:41.580
but I think what we really have to remember and what I try to keep in mind is like

55:42.300 --> 55:43.820
98 of the

55:43.820 --> 55:47.180
Listeners don't even participate in any of this stuff, right? They don't got time for this

55:47.500 --> 55:52.060
They got stuff to do or they just can't be bothered and honestly, they're probably better off and healthier for it

55:52.060 --> 55:56.220
Let's see. Let's be real right the internet can be an awful place. Although our communities are great

55:56.780 --> 56:01.420
Uh, so I also have to realize like this isn't the stuff that makes or breaks the business, right? Like

56:01.980 --> 56:04.460
If I if I bet the farm, uh on matrix

56:05.500 --> 56:07.580
Doesn't really any impact impact anything on air. Does it?

56:08.220 --> 56:10.940
Uh, we just maybe you know, maybe don't get the right kind of interactions, but

56:10.940 --> 56:15.900
So far we've been getting great interactions from our matrix community. I mean they're going right now as we talk and uh, you know

56:15.900 --> 56:21.580
I knew about sir lurks a lot's journey into self-hosting after he got into boosting because he said something in the kota radio feedback

56:21.660 --> 56:24.860
matrix and like so it it does definitely create communities and

56:25.500 --> 56:30.540
Uh, we have a really really awesome bitcoin community in there because it's a bunch of level-headed

56:30.700 --> 56:36.700
Bitcoiners, but they're all a bunch of level-headed people that respect each other and talk rationally and aren't a bunch of like scammers and

56:36.700 --> 56:41.340
Like that's been a real source of good conversation as the market has just been totally tanking

56:41.500 --> 56:46.060
to have a bunch of level-headed people in there talking about it and and you know sharing their thoughts and

56:46.460 --> 56:48.460
definitely a diverse set of opinions

56:48.780 --> 56:53.660
And I really found that fulfilling and I just don't i'm not getting that anywhere else outside of matrix right now. In fact

56:54.380 --> 57:00.380
I think you're seeing a real drawdown in telegram activity as that discussion has moved over to matrix as a result

57:00.380 --> 57:04.540
I don't know if what your observations are on this brand. I know matrix is a company that's

57:04.540 --> 57:09.100
What your observations are on this brand? I know matrix has been a little bit harder of an adoption curve for you

57:09.180 --> 57:11.180
So maybe you see things a little differently

57:11.180 --> 57:13.340
No, I I actually do have to agree

57:13.500 --> 57:19.100
Uh, I know I haven't necessarily witnessed the stuff on on the matrix side as much as you have because of some of the

57:20.060 --> 57:25.900
Challenges I think partly due to some of the older hardware i'm trying to you know, make use of but I

57:26.460 --> 57:29.500
Gotta say I noticed just this morning that the telegram chat

57:30.060 --> 57:32.060
Was feeling a little

57:32.060 --> 57:36.620
I don't know. I saw a few tumbleweeds passing by in there and I thought oh, yeah

57:36.780 --> 57:41.660
It's not because the discussion is not happening. It's just because it's happening elsewhere. Yeah, and maybe it's better than matrix

57:41.740 --> 57:44.380
I mean, i'm sorry the telegram is honestly in my opinion

57:45.180 --> 57:46.300
more

57:46.300 --> 57:49.500
Followable now like it's not just like you show up and it's like oh god. I can't keep up with this

57:49.820 --> 57:52.380
Yeah, it used to be a little overwhelming actually. Yeah

57:53.340 --> 57:57.980
So it's not all bad. No, I think it's just different really I I do appreciate the feedback

57:57.980 --> 58:03.500
I am totally open to more uh feedback on the topic because you know, i'm not married to anyone particular thing

58:03.500 --> 58:05.180
It's just where i'm at right now

58:05.180 --> 58:10.620
James wrote in hi. I keep on wanting to help the show by subscribing or these new boosts

58:11.240 --> 58:13.980
16 a month for a membership is too much for me

58:13.980 --> 58:18.060
But there doesn't seem to be an option for supporting a single show at a lesser cost

58:18.700 --> 58:25.100
I downloaded fountain went to buy whatever it is. It gave me a code and left me hanging no instructions on how to buy

58:25.100 --> 58:30.540
I've never bought bitcoin before so i'm still stuck with no real idea how to support your shows

58:30.620 --> 58:34.860
I'll research it later. But wondering how many others are put off you're coming in cold

58:35.420 --> 58:39.260
What happens is you go into something like fountain or castamatic or another one of these new apps?

58:39.740 --> 58:42.220
The way lightning works is traditionally it's invoice based

58:42.860 --> 58:44.860
So you generate an invoice in that app?

58:45.660 --> 58:49.580
And it gives you a long code or a qr code, but a long

58:50.220 --> 58:51.500
string

58:51.500 --> 58:53.500
It doesn't buy the bitcoin for you

58:53.500 --> 58:59.420
Because that would probably get them in a whole bunch of new types of regulations and legal troubles all over the world, right?

58:59.420 --> 59:06.780
Like you can imagine how much there is to navigate there because of all of the know your customer requirements of the financial system

59:07.740 --> 59:10.140
So they generate the invoice and then the idea is

59:10.860 --> 59:12.860
That you go use a lightning compliant

59:13.500 --> 59:14.300
app

59:14.300 --> 59:16.140
like strike or

59:16.140 --> 59:23.500
blue wallet or cash app something like that and then you paste that long code into that app and

59:24.060 --> 59:27.980
It will then recognize the invoice amount and make the transaction happen

59:28.540 --> 59:34.140
But it's not obvious and that is why if we didn't have such a technical savvy audience

59:34.220 --> 59:36.460
I just wouldn't even bother even doing this

59:37.180 --> 59:38.300
but

59:38.300 --> 59:40.300
Like if we don't figure out

59:40.860 --> 59:42.460
These rough spots

59:42.460 --> 59:44.940
If we won't early adopt some of this stuff like matrix

59:44.940 --> 59:47.820
Like boosts, it's never going to go anywhere and

59:48.540 --> 59:52.860
We can see the network effect building, but we still have hurdles to overcome

59:53.580 --> 01:00:00.300
But man, is it so so so much better than it was a year ago. It's so much better now and like

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.420
Strike makes it so

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:06.060
Stupid simple and it used to be really complicated

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:10.460
The only tricky part now is you got to do all your like, you know know your customer id stuff, but they just

01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:13.260
They're required to do that now to the memberships

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:19.260
Now to the memberships the boosts are additive. They don't replace the memberships and 16 is a lot

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:22.300
I get that that's just based on what our costs are

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:29.920
And we do offer individual show memberships. Maybe that might be your way to go like unpluggedcore.com or coderqa.co

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:34.860
Those are those are cheaper because they only get you access to that one show but it's still a way to support

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:37.500
I hope as

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.580
Things get more regulated

01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.500
as laws pass

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:48.540
As things get more normalized it won't be that hard for an app like fountain to just charge up the wallet right from inside the app

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:52.220
That's going to happen eventually you can imagine you can see it

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:55.920
Especially if they could just tie right in with apple pay or google pay for the transaction

01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:02.140
It'll happen, but we're just not there yet because of the regulatory environment. So in the meantime, there's this two app process

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:04.300
Makes sense, I guess

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:06.860
Not not ideal, right? I think the other thing chris is

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:11.980
Is I think we could do a better job of describing the various options and it's something you and I have talked about

01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:15.500
and uh, I think something i'm going to work on in the next week or two is

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:20.060
Just describing our various options a little bit better

01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:27.020
You know you've described via audio on several of the episodes and a variety of podcasts how to do some of the boosting

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:33.660
But I think writing that down in tech text with maybe some links to these various apps might be a really nice way to

01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:39.100
To someone who's never done it before and also I I feel like you know

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:45.340
This may be kicked off a little bit of the website discussion was it's sometimes a little bit hard to get all that information

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:46.780
on the websites

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:48.780
the way that they're structured currently so

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:52.460
I think we're going to try to do that as best we can right now the new website

01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:56.380
Hopefully will help help with that. But I think it's worth putting a little work into that

01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:00.540
As it stands. Yeah, having an audio is all well and good

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:05.420
but it's not very accessible when you're in the moment and you're trying to get it set up and you're like

01:02:05.420 --> 01:02:11.420
Well, what did he say? And if it was just a dupe dupe dupe kind of thing, you know, just an outline

01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:16.620
It'd be a lot. It'd be a lot straight more straightforward. We'll get there. This is where I know i'm making a big ask

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:21.900
Right. This is a big ask i'm making here. It's a calculated thing because it's not something I take lightly

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.140
but

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.140
If we get it figured out for jb

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.620
Then the next linux podcast that comes on

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:34.640
Automatically has a couple thousand people ready to boost their show, right? The next open source project that comes on

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:42.480
Has a couple thousand people ready to boost their project the long-term benefit goes so much farther beyond just jupiter broadcasting

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:47.040
That i'm willing to make the calculated ask i'm trying to be generous in how I ask it

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:49.120
I guess i'm kind of banking on the idea

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.320
The people that have been listening to me long enough

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.520
You kind of know how I operate right and they know where i'm going with this and they can they can see my logic

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.520
Is kind of what i'm hoping

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.640
And you know, I get I you know, I get it I get it

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:08.400
It's not super straightforward. I don't want anybody to get frustrated. There are other ways to contribute value that are not just monetary

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.200
Honestly, just telling people

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:14.480
about the show and advocating for our shows is

01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:19.680
Extremely valuable because podcasts are not something people just generally pick up and listen to

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.880
That's why these clips thing in fountain has actually been a big thing for me because generally, you know, it's an hour-long show

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:30.560
I'm just going to listen to some randos that I don't even know talk for an hour. Like i'm not going to do that

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:36.720
Right who does so but you know if brent comes to me and says hey, you know

01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.320
I really think you'd like this episode

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.480
They talked about xyz and you know

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:43.840
We've talked about that and I really thought they had some good insights or they they had this great tool

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:48.000
They talked about well, then I listened to that episode. We do that all the time with each other. Oh, yeah

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:53.760
So that is extremely valuable right going and leaving us a rating or a review somewhere

01:03:53.760 --> 01:04:00.400
On a on a popular podcast directory very valuable because that obviously helps juice their their metrics

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.040
You know leaving a comment on a youtube video and giving us a thumbs up that even helps on the channel there, right?

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:12.160
There's that's it. There's big ways and small ways, uh to help out and contribute and sometimes people like to physically contribute

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.440
You know, they show up and help us here

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:17.200
Sometimes they like to show up in the mumba room and contribute that way and it's all of it

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:22.640
It's really super appreciated. Of course the financial contributions super appreciated because it is a business

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:28.960
And it has to run and we got it. We got things. We want to do. We got a big road trip. We're planning for

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:34.240
And my plan is to head down to the shop this weekend

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.120
And get suspension problems

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:42.960
Finalized I kind of got like a broken suspension system on our last road trip because the you remember how bad the roads were

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.440
It was oh, it was memorably bad

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.080
So bad, so so bad

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:50.720
like

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:55.600
The worst you've ever experienced third world bad almost like they forgot to finish the road

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:00.000
So we did like some emergency fixes just so we could get out of tucson and get home, right?

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:05.920
But the work wasn't done. There's probably like another five grand worth of work that has to happen. So we're going down

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.960
Uh this weekend i'll probably do lup

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:14.320
Live from oregon, so you'll be back home for lup and i'll be live

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:18.160
Wes is on a trip. So wes won't be there this sunday. Oh my goodness

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:23.680
Should I just travel to the studio and keep it company? Well, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, somebody here to run the board, right?

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.360
I don't know. Yeah, I gotta think about that that is gonna be tricky. It's gonna be tricky

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.000
so that's you know, there's just there's a lot just a it's funny like um

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:39.040
How much mundane day-to-day life stuff goes into making all this possible, right?

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:43.680
Because this road trip to to get jupes fixed up is really in service of a bigger road trip

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:48.160
We have planned later in the year to do meetups and stuff like that. It's just how it works. It's

01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.760
So, uh, let's see

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.040
We don't have an office hours next week

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:56.800
But we will have one a week after because we're doing this twice a month fortnightly fortnightly

01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.900
Which if i'm doing my maths right that means our next episode will be on may 24th

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:04.960
Really? Yes, I think right at noon pacific 3 p.m. Eastern

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:08.480
It's weird how it's it's almost like dinner time where you're at

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.200
You got dinner figured out

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:13.280
um

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:16.480
I think we were gonna go for sushi, but then decided to do that for lunch instead

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:20.560
So I don't know what we're doing for dinner. Hmm, you know, alex hasn't

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.280
Got the smoker up and running in a few days

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:30.880
So maybe pizzas in that fancy oven of his I don't know what we're doing honeymoon period is officially over is what i'm hearing clearly

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.320
You're not cooking they're not cooking

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:39.200
You want to go get something fine when how about after he's done with the podcast thing fine

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
fine

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Time to go home. Well

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:49.200
I'd love to have people join us on the 24th over jblive.tv hang out in the mumble room

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.240
Come on into the office. It's a virtual office. So it's available to anybody

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:56.960
Don't forget you can send us a boost with your jb bug fix request or comments

01:06:57.040 --> 01:07:02.560
And of course, we do have the github page where we are collecting continued discussions on our website improvements

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.600
And then we're going to try to cover them in each episode as we proceed

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.760
At least that's the plan I guess right brentley something like that. Yeah

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:13.520
Um mumble room. Thank you so much for making it today. Appreciate you guys

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:16.160
Have a great rest of your week. Hope to see you next time

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:24.240
Bye everybody. Goodbye chat room. Thanks for being here. All right, that's it. Bye. That's it. We're done. Bye

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.520
Office hours is over. Get out of here. Thanks for being here

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.880
Okay, I gotta have my office back now

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.600
geez

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:39.600
Come on
