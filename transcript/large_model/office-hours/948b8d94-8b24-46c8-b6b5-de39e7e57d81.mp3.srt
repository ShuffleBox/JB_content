1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,580
You'd think the episodes where we're together in person would be the ones where we really

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:04,580
have our crap together.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,920
Give me another three minutes and I think we might be better.

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,920
Three minutes?

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,920
No way.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
We gotta start right now.

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
We can't wait three minutes.

8
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,160
Let me just move some things here.

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,360
It's Office Hours with me, Chris.

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,360
Come on in everybody.

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:30,040
It's a special Office Hours because we are down in Roasty Toasty Pasadena, California,

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:35,960
about to go tour JPL and my two good buddies are joining me right here live in the office.

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
Hello, Brent.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,960
Hello, Wes.

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,960
Well, hello.

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,960
Hello, handsome.

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,200
Nice to have you both here with me.

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,960
Nice to have you joining us, Wes.

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,960
It's been a minute.

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,280
Yes, it has, but I can't think of a better place to be right now.

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,580
It's been a crazy few days.

22
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,240
Since we officed together, we've driven through three states.

23
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,860
We've met many listeners.

24
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,480
We've lit a barbecue on fire.

25
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,480
We've done a lot.

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,480
Accidentally.

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,480
Yeah.

28
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,480
I mean, accidentally.

29
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,480
We'll get to all of that.

30
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,520
But I'm feeling like it's time to catch up with the audience and tell everybody what's

31
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,140
been going on for a little bit.

32
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,080
We have so many stories to share, and even though Brent isn't ready to do the show yet-

33
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,360
Not quite, but I'm getting there.

34
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,520
I mean, I feel like we just proceed without him, you know, until he's ready because he's

35
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,280
you know, I feel like since we're all together, I can just, I can watch him and I can see

36
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
what he's ready.

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,080
You might have to run a bit, but you can catch up.

38
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
Yeah.

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,160
I won't say why he's so tired, but I think there's a reason.

40
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,920
Now, I thought maybe we'd tell a little bit of the story of getting down here.

41
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,200
Yeah, I took the easy way.

42
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
I just flew down here.

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
But you too.

44
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,160
I mean, yeah, you've been venturing.

45
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:44,800
I had, I had the worst, worst stress and anxiety getting ready to go.

46
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,280
Were you feeling this too, Brent?

47
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,360
Oh, easily, because we, we tried to squeeze in a ton of projects at the studio as well.

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,600
And but when it came time to, I think we were both extremely stressed.

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,760
Well, you got that server AC bill?

50
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,800
No, I think maybe that'll be on the other end of the trip.

51
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,800
We'll see.

52
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,360
The thing was, like, we knew we had to- Monday morning, we were going to leave, and we wanted

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,620
to do, we wanted to do in like, like a pro move, right?

54
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,440
And that was try to bypass Seattle, Tacoma, and Portland traffic.

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,240
And to do that, you have to leave our area at a very specific time, because you got to

56
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,240
hit the gas station, and you got to hit Seattle at this time, you got to hit Tacoma at this

57
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,560
time, Portland just at this time.

58
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,200
And that meant that we needed to leave no later than 11am Pacific time.

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,520
You have this all calculated out.

60
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,720
Yeah, but that's after having recorded a show for you, right, Chris?

61
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,720
Right.

62
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,300
Well, so Sunday, we did two LUPs, we did a five hour live stream.

63
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,080
And then Monday morning, I did a really early coder.

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,480
And I was trying to get everything done, figuring, well, if I get coder complete, we can race

65
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,200
up to the to the RV, we can load up and we can head out by 11am.

66
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,960
And well, let's just say 12 hours later than I thought we would leave, Brent and I were

67
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,640
still working on projects.

68
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:06,840
Well, it's about 12 hours after when I thought we'd be leaving and the sun is mostly set.

69
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,640
Brent's working on more projects.

70
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,920
Hey, what are you working on down there?

71
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,320
Well, there's like a little skirt that's under the engine and it's falling a little bit.

72
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,640
We think it might be a little problematic and kind of worried about maybe in our like

73
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
fuel efficiency.

74
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
Yeah.

75
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,360
And you hate for it to get caught while we're driving.

76
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,600
So it also has reduced our clearance.

77
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
So there's that.

78
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Yeah.

79
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,400
But mostly I want to see what kind of miles per gallon we can get out of this thing.

80
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Yeah.

81
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,200
Last time we did, what, 46 or something incredible 46 miles per gallon on a Ford Focus, a 2013

82
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,520
Ford Focus, like one hundred and thirty five thousand miles on it.

83
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,200
Yeah, we did all right.

84
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,840
But we're still here.

85
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:52,920
So then out, I guess the plan is we're just going to get up really early in the morning

86
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,200
and head out at about 4am.

87
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,240
And we did.

88
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,600
We actually did very well, I think.

89
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,800
We got everything ready to go.

90
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,320
We even unplugged jupes from shore power, brought the slides in and just were basically

91
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,780
turn the key and go.

92
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,800
And it was one of those situations where we had done a lot of thinking about preparing

93
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,380
the RV for the road trip, but we haven't done a lot of thinking about preparing the chase

94
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,840
car that we're driving around that we drove down here to Pasadena.

95
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,840
Yeah, right.

96
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,840
You didn't drive one vehicle.

97
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,840
You took two vehicles.

98
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,840
Right.

99
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,840
This way.

100
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,840
Did we ever do that oil change that we were thinking about?

101
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Nope.

102
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,840
Oh, no.

103
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,840
That's how the whole that.

104
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,760
So that's how this all started is we were going to do an oil change and then we discovered

105
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:38,380
that Ford puts it like a skirt underneath the Focus and it's completely sealed up underneath.

106
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,080
And then we discovered that it was sagging and potentially dragging and we needed to

107
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
fix that.

108
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,480
It's almost like whoever put it on last and put it on right.

109
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,920
I really struggled to get in place.

110
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Thankfully, we did.

111
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,120
Do you remember I also had to fill the oil?

112
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
Yeah.

113
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
Yeah.

114
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,520
The oil was a little low and then we almost overfilled it.

115
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,000
No, no, I think.

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah.

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,720
For about 10 minutes, we knew that I did overfill it and that's how it brought us to me being

118
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
under the car.

119
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
Yeah.

120
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
It was it was a process.

121
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,720
And that was into the dark.

122
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,720
Right.

123
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
That was late at night.

124
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
We had to do that to ourselves.

125
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,600
But it also included like harvesting the garden.

126
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,080
So we had fruits and veggies for not for snacks for the road.

127
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,080
We had snacks.

128
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Yeah.

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,400
Yeah, I will say that time, Chris, had we left at 11, we would have not been ready and

130
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
we would have been stressed.

131
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,900
I think the whole trip because we would not have had the things we needed.

132
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,040
There was just stuff we had to do.

133
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,800
And I was just refusing to accept it.

134
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,360
But the inevitability of it just was just inescapable.

135
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
One, of course.

136
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,040
I mean, you always have a target to leave, right?

137
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,880
But you had like an actual in an actual event to be headed towards that you couldn't put

138
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
off.

139
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,340
That's just it that we had a deadline.

140
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,120
We had a meetup the next day, which turned out to be the day we left.

141
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,120
Right.

142
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,680
So we knew we had to leave early because we had to make it down.

143
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,400
They're still trying to miss all the traffic, which we did.

144
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,400
But then we had to get to Grants Pass for our meetup there at Grants Pass.

145
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,740
And we got to our campsite about 45 minutes before the meetup started away.

146
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,280
It wasn't a huge meetup, but it was it was a really great meetup.

147
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,880
We had a good little group there and we had room for extra people to sit down and join

148
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,600
us and geek out with us.

149
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:18,480
We chatted things about like a wireless wisps in the area and ISP, you know, politics for

150
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,200
that location and just the I.T. marketing grants pass.

151
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,360
Yeah, we had David with us and he was really great.

152
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,240
He's going to join us at JPL as well.

153
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,240
Yeah.

154
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,240
That's awesome.

155
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,720
Do you remember Devin and Juniper joined us?

156
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Yeah.

157
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,800
And then also his mom and friends and his mom's sister.

158
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,440
Oh, if I was 60 years older, I would have been I would have been interested in.

159
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,880
She was a lot of fun.

160
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
It was great.

161
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,280
In fact, the whole family and they were RVers, too.

162
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,720
So I you know, I got to geek out about, you know, the different RV knowledge we have about

163
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,720
the local area.

164
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,720
There's some about these meetups.

165
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,160
I mean, just kindred spirits, whether they use Linux or not.

166
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Yeah, that's what I noticed.

167
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,880
Definitely is like we were totally done for that day.

168
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,240
I mean, we traveled with like eight hours or something like that.

169
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,920
They're still gentle and they're easy.

170
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,920
Yeah.

171
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,000
But also it was like they're just friends of ours.

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay.

173
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Friends we've never met before.

174
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But the conversation is easy.

175
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah.

176
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You just jump into it.

177
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's very, very, very smooth.

178
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So that's your that's your Grant's Pass review, handsy, but real smooth and easy.

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Yeah.

180
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,480
And we really didn't get much time.

181
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,480
In fact, I worked almost the entire time in Grant's Pass with the exception of the meetup.

182
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,720
And this has happened on the last year's road tour, too, with the exception of the meetup.

183
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
I never even left the campground.

184
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Yeah.

185
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
We said we wouldn't do this again.

186
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
I know.

187
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:36,640
And then Brent went off for what looked like a lovely hike, I think, and I'm sitting there

188
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:43,760
stuck in the damn RV the entire time.

189
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
I think he's guilty.

190
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,760
He feels guilty about it.

191
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
I do really feel guilty.

192
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
It was wonderful.

193
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,120
I even like crossed a small river without my shoes on.

194
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
With Levi, right?

195
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,400
Oh, Levi was so cute.

196
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,920
But I do happen to know one of your goals here was to, you know, show Brent some of

197
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,400
the wonderful areas you take yourself to.

198
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,680
No, it's the Burt Hedea gets to do it as well.

199
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,760
You know, and she gets to tell me about all the cool places she explored while I recorded.

200
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
And that's fine.

201
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,640
And someone has to walk the dog.

202
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,800
Somebody's got to do the podcasting.

203
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
Somebody's got to walk the dog.

204
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,320
It's just the way things went.

205
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
If it helps.

206
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,960
We also did drop a geocache while we were out.

207
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
Yeah.

208
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Yeah.

209
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
So we should tell people about that.

210
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,600
There's a geocache for people to find in Grant's Pass, or at least that area.

211
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
There is.

212
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
And I, you know, it's a funny thing.

213
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,860
I don't want to give too much away.

214
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,680
But at the same time, I actually think it might be really difficult to find.

215
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Yeah.

216
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
And I should make it clear.

217
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,200
It's north or so of Grant's Pass on the on the freeway.

218
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Yeah, it is.

219
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,000
It's actually in a place called Canyonville.

220
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,760
And I think Cow Creek might actually be a bit more of an accurate description.

221
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,240
We do have GPS coordinates that we'll share in the show notes.

222
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,480
And there's a hilarious photo of me standing on this giant pile of rocks at a small.

223
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
What do you call those, Chris?

224
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
A rest stop?

225
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,640
Yeah, I think it's a rest stop is a good description of it.

226
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,320
And there's a massive pile of boulders somewhere and it flanks this rest stop.

227
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,800
Unfortunately, yeah, I think it's in there somewhere.

228
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,040
We made it fairly, it's fairly visible for being hidden under a bunch of large boulders.

229
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,720
But I think we underestimated how accurate the GPS might be on a phone.

230
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,760
Yeah, we'll see if you find it, though.

231
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,720
What would be lovely because we're going to be dropping these throughout the trip.

232
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,800
What would be lovely is just take a few photos of you, even just searching for it.

233
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,080
If you find it, do a little video or something, maybe some audio, send it our way.

234
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,480
And you can either keep there's a whole bunch of crazy awesome stuff in there.

235
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,680
We put a bunch of very fun things.

236
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,320
I won't spoil too much of it because you got to try to find it.

237
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
But you can take the stuff, you can replace it with new stuff for someone else to find.

238
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,480
Up to you.

239
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,560
But we'd love to get a few photos and videos of that.

240
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Yeah.

241
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,080
Yeah, that's I'm really looking forward to that as we go about.

242
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,640
And we did we did deploy one in the area.

243
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,520
And then we eventually packed up and we did a long drive to Sacramento.

244
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:08,160
Oh, man, like almost eight hours of driving, tons and tons of miles, lots of traffic.

245
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,080
And we got right to hide another geocache in the Sacramento area, too.

246
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,360
It's the second geocache.

247
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,240
It's been successfully tucked away in a place.

248
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,920
Let's see how it hints.

249
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,200
Water nearby.

250
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,060
There's a bridge nearby and an old power plant nearby.

251
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:32,760
And sometimes when the forest burns, you can plant a secret geocache and something beautiful

252
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,560
will grow.

253
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
That's the hint.

254
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:42,520
And of course, it's in Sacramento by an old power plant by the water, perhaps in Folsom.

255
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,920
But those are all the hints I'm giving.

256
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,040
And it's in a Tupperware container.

257
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,240
But that's the last hint.

258
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
And there is a shirt in there.

259
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,800
But that's not really a hint that there's this old hydro plant.

260
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,440
If you're a local, you might know what we're talking about.

261
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,640
And that's a that's your hint.

262
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,720
You go there and there's a little park area.

263
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,260
They also get free tours.

264
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,260
Really amazing.

265
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,260
Yeah.

266
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
Historical experience.

267
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,260
Really, really cool.

268
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,260
Yeah.

269
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,260
We have more geocaches to deploy.

270
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,120
So keep your ears out for where those are going to be at.

271
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,680
Not everything went smooth.

272
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,000
You know, we had a bit of a gear failure at our Sacramento meetup.

273
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,920
Oh, really good meetup at a place called.

274
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,440
Oh, I know we have the name of it.

275
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,520
We should have been mentioning the name of all of them.

276
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,520
Really great brewery.

277
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
These are all breweries.

278
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Urban Roots Brewery and Steakhouse.

279
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,520
Smokehouse.

280
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,520
Sorry, I got that wrong.

281
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,520
Smokehouse.

282
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,680
Actual decent brisket.

283
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,720
Decent barbecue.

284
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,800
We just didn't have decent gear.

285
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Live meetup report.

286
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,400
Brent is trying to fix our audio recorder.

287
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
So I just busted out the phone.

288
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
This works.

289
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
This thing works really nice.

290
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Look at that.

291
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
You got a graph.

292
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
I know.

293
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,400
Real time visuals, dude.

294
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,400
It's incredible.

295
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,400
Good meetup, though.

296
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,480
Good food, but bad recording equipment.

297
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
We got new gear.

298
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
We should have set it up before we got here.

299
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Yeah, it's true.

300
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
I had to set the date.

301
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
It was really embarrassing.

302
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,440
Was it like defaulted to 94 because it's pretty old gear?

303
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,400
It's actually 2014, but if you click up to go like to 2015, 2016, it actually brings

304
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
you straight to 2050.

305
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I was like, wait a second.

306
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,080
So you have to click down to bring the date up.

307
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,080
It was really awkward.

308
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,080
Yeah.

309
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,160
I mean, we're not working with the latest and greatest, but it works.

310
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,880
Well, okay, it isn't working.

311
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,880
We'll get there.

312
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,600
The phone works and it has the right time.

313
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,200
Sacramento is a special place because we had the meetup.

314
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,420
We did the geocache, but one of the true legends of this trip is listener Jeff, who put a lot

315
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,100
of effort in to set up a space for us that we could camp at for a few days.

316
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:41,480
We could do some shows and it was an effort to get JOOPS into his backyard because he's

317
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,600
just living in suburbia in Sacramento.

318
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,880
It's not really like designed for large vehicles.

319
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,720
We worked getting JOOPS in there for about a half hour.

320
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,800
You can hear her in this clip.

321
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,640
She's just working as I slowly back her into the yard.

322
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,520
You were backing up for like a half hour?

323
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Oh yeah.

324
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,760
We were blocking traffic and everything.

325
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,840
We had to like shim the road in certain spot.

326
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,840
It was a whole ordeal.

327
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,840
Yeah.

328
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Brent out with like as a flagger.

329
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,960
He was out moving paver stones with Jeff at like a rapid pace as we're trying to get her

330
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,300
back tires up over the curb, which just a tighter fit than we expected.

331
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,720
We thought we'd clear it and JOOPS did it for a half hour.

332
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,880
She did it as I move forward, move back, move forward, move back and then back her up in

333
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,880
there.

334
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:30,000
And then there was probably eight inches of clearance of the fence on one side of her.

335
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,980
It was a really, really kind of touch and go thing because we were all sort of frazzled

336
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,360
because we've been driving for seven and a half hours.

337
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,840
None of your sharpest.

338
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,520
And the last bit of it was right before the Sacramento airport where traffic got real

339
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
thick.

340
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,720
And the last bit of it was intense driving, too.

341
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,720
So we were fried and it had just been really kind of a real hectic situation to block traffic

342
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
is super stressful.

343
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,480
Why do we do this to ourselves?

344
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
I don't know.

345
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
I don't know.

346
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
How's the exit going to be?

347
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Well, we're going to report back.

348
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,400
We will figure that out when we get there because, yeah, we drove a car down to Pasadena,

349
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,560
which was, you know, like another six, seven hours of driving from Sacramento.

350
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,160
And so we left JOOPS all locked up back in Sacramento, which is really one of the, I

351
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,200
think, strategic decisions of this trip.

352
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,160
But we do not know how we're getting out just yet.

353
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,600
We're going to take it slow and find out if you can beat that 30 minutes.

354
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,040
So, you know, that's why I think listener Jeff, who has been a true legend and he's

355
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,380
joined us on this trip, I think that's why he's found this a little more relaxing than

356
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,380
we have so far.

357
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,600
A lot more relaxing than I expected, actually thought that I was going to be stressed out

358
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,520
and worn down, but you guys have basically done all my cooking and all my cleaning for

359
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
me.

360
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,520
So can't really complain.

361
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,320
Isn't that nice?

362
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,360
Now, you did a whole bunch of solar stuff on your house.

363
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,040
It seems like you're an expert at some of this stuff.

364
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:00,520
You did put in some electrical stuff at the barn where the RV usually is.

365
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
That was many years ago.

366
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,720
Tell us a little bit about that.

367
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:11,720
So that was me randomly reaching out to Chris from an old, what was that user error episode

368
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,600
about him complaining about popping his 15 amp breaker from electric heaters.

369
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,400
So I just sent him a message and said, this is something I know how to do.

370
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,360
Would you like me to come up and do it?

371
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,680
He said, yes.

372
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,040
So I did.

373
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:30,280
And we threw up a 50 amp receptacle for his RV, put the breaker in, did the pipe, all

374
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
that.

375
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,880
It took about 45 minutes, something like that, and got it done.

376
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,880
Nice.

377
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,120
So you knew that when we were going to park Lady Joops at your place for several days

378
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,360
recording shows there, and then for several days while we're here in Pasadena, that you

379
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,640
knew kind of what the requirements were going to be.

380
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,840
So what changed at your place in the last few weeks?

381
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,220
So I did the same thing, but I didn't want a permanent installation.

382
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:04,520
So just recently put up my solar and got that taken care of and needed an inspection done

383
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,600
as well.

384
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,480
So I had to make this temporary, didn't want an extra 50 amp receptacle on my wall.

385
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:17,280
So I set up a pallet, put the receptacle on said pallet, ran pipe around the corner of

386
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,880
the wall, then tied that into my main panel.

387
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,880
Pipe just kind of goes in to the panel, taped up nice and safe.

388
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,080
Everything's wired up properly though and on the correct breaker.

389
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,920
So legitimately is actually safe.

390
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,920
But that's a temporary installation of a 50 amp RV plug.

391
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,920
From what I can tell, and I've done a few Renaults, it's the nicest sort of last minute

392
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,280
MacGyver job I've ever seen.

393
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,940
So kudos to you.

394
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:50,920
And you did a little bit of work on the RV as well when we were there, didn't you?

395
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,920
Yeah.

396
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:59,640
So I tied into the water pumps power, put a Y splitter on there with XT60 connectors

397
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,800
so that they can plug in their, what do they call it?

398
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,920
The, what do they call that thing?

399
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,040
The poop grinder?

400
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,160
I think it's the macerator, the poop blender.

401
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,440
That's what they call it.

402
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:21,120
So they can plug in their poop blender separately and let that thing chew away and do its job.

403
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,600
So no more secondary battery and alligator clips.

404
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,760
Sweet.

405
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,680
And actually it's, it's been remarkable to see Lady Joob's right beside your house.

406
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,480
Your house is great, but Lady Joob's kind of towers over it in a kind of way.

407
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Do you find that kind of funny?

408
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Yeah.

409
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,160
I think it actually shades the Southeast panels on my house.

410
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
It's so damn big.

411
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,880
It's wonderful though.

412
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,360
It really is a sight to behold.

413
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,960
Well, I got to say it's been great to have you on this trip and for us to stay at your

414
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
place.

415
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,640
But we're only like partway into the trip.

416
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,200
So I'm looking forward to hanging out some more and going to JPL together.

417
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,280
It's going to be a lot of fun.

418
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,280
That's about it.

419
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Tons of fun.

420
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,840
You know what he didn't mention, but was super useful?

421
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,000
He also ran out an ethernet cable out for us.

422
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh yeah.

423
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,800
So Joob's has ethernet internet, which made doing the shows a lot better.

424
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,920
It was really great.

425
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
And she's sitting there.

426
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,320
It's 90 degrees out.

427
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,520
She's nice and comfortable.

428
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,520
You know?

429
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
So great.

430
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,280
And so now we're hanging out here, we're in our makeshift recording room, which is the

431
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,960
dining room and describe the room, Chris, would you?

432
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,140
You know, like, um, if you, have you ever seen a picture of somebody who's a hoarder

433
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,820
and they've like, they're like really mentally ill and like you, you realize they've been

434
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,760
hoarding for like 20 years and nobody knew about it.

435
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,800
And like every room of their house, it's just piled full of stuff.

436
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,280
Can you know that?

437
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Yeah.

438
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,460
That's what this room looks like.

439
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,480
We've taken all of the beds from, there's no, there are no servers.

440
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,840
We've taken all of the mattresses and all of the blankets and all of the pillows.

441
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,080
And for some reason, this Airbnb had a lot of extra pillows.

442
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,080
Helpful.

443
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,080
We'll have to note that in the review.

444
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Yeah.

445
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
Yeah.

446
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
I would say, I mean, I'm not even exaggerating.

447
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,680
I'd say probably 30 more pillows than you need.

448
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
No dish soap.

449
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
Plenty of pillows.

450
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,680
No dish soap.

451
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
No can opener.

452
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,680
Nope.

453
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Nope.

454
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Nope.

455
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,160
Um, and so we brought all of it into the room.

456
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,580
In fact, we're recording late tonight.

457
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:18,440
So nobody can go to bed until we're done recording.

458
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,440
Sorry everybody.

459
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,880
Well, except a little Levi who's taking a nap on one of the blankets.

460
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
Yeah.

461
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,880
We have Levi here.

462
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,880
He's, he's curled up.

463
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
He thinks this is great.

464
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,880
I'm sure.

465
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,600
And it, you know, it's not even perfect, but we made something out of it.

466
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,200
And the thing that is nice is it has a great kitchen area and has a great outdoor cooking

467
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,680
area.

468
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,220
And so we decided to do something really kind of special because part of what made this road

469
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:48,080
trip possible is our audience contributing some sats to Brent's, uh, petrol fund.

470
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Is that what you call it up there in Canada?

471
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,800
I think it was sats gas tank.

472
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,760
Do you, do you call it petrol in Canada?

473
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Oh no, we don't.

474
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,440
It's only our, uh, you know, British cousins.

475
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,820
So we had a, you know, a gas fund to help Brent get down to the studio.

476
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:06,880
And Brent is a generally safe studious driver.

477
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,080
So we had some leftover sats and I think it was Brent's idea.

478
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,640
Let's treat everybody to dinner and let's get some food cranking on that barbecue that

479
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,720
we bought with the sats.

480
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,160
This sucker is cranked.

481
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,520
It's over 600 degrees in there, but that means it should cook Brent's Satoshi squares nice

482
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
and quick.

483
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,220
He's made us some nice potatoes all chopped up.

484
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,520
Taters bought with sats boosted in.

485
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
Yeah.

486
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
That's hot over there.

487
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,520
It's hot, like 600 degrees.

488
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
So be careful.

489
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,520
You grew these.

490
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
Oh, these are really out of the garden.

491
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
These are not Satoshi.

492
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
Well, I don't know.

493
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,520
Wait a minute, dude.

494
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,520
Are you saying these are illegal potatoes that we smuggled across state lines?

495
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
Oh no.

496
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,080
I think the Satoshi squares would have been better.

497
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,280
Brent was shocked when we stopped at the California border and they, they screen everybody who

498
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
crosses the border.

499
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,180
This is something that doesn't happen in most states, but it happens in California.

500
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:04,560
Every vehicle has to stop for inspection and the inspection consists of one question.

501
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:09,720
Do you have any fruits or produce or no, any vegetables or produce on board is what they

502
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
do.

503
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,360
And I just think about it for like a half second saying, no, we don't have any, which

504
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:20,400
was false because we had just harvested the entire garden and then of course they probably

505
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,480
forgot about that and thought we ordered these.

506
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,960
I thought we, I thought we got these and we'll, we'll talk about how here in just a moment.

507
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,000
If you forget your crime, is that really even a crime?

508
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yeah.

509
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Right.

510
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Exactly.

511
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Exactly.

512
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,680
So maybe the potatoes weren't bought with the sats like I thought they were, but the

513
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,740
steaks, those were definitely bought with the sats.

514
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,000
We had some tasty sat steaks.

515
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
All right.

516
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,980
The first sat steak is going on the grill and this one has a sear.

517
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
Look at that.

518
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,980
Okay.

519
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,980
Here we go.

520
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,980
You ready?

521
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,980
Yeah.

522
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
I'm definitely ready.

523
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,880
You know, the sat steaks, they smell a little better than a regular steak.

524
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
They smell like decentralization.

525
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,880
Okay.

526
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
Ready?

527
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,880
Yeah.

528
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,880
Give her a flip.

529
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,480
Oh, look at that.

530
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,720
That is great, so that really sears them really well.

531
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
That's fantastic.

532
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:16,160
And then we just finish them up on the regular grill, wait for it.

533
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:22,840
Like a pro, like a pro, nicely done next sat steak and we'll just move right down the line.

534
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,480
I said next for the vegan of the group, Brent's a pretty dang good meat griller.

535
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,040
I have to say, and this barbecue was cool because it has a dedicated sear grill.

536
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,720
Yeah, I've never seen that before, but that was actually like, as far as purpose built,

537
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,680
it was exactly what we needed.

538
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,680
Yeah.

539
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,200
And the sat states were going great.

540
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,220
They were smelling delicious, Hedia made, you know, a little crisp on the edge.

541
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:53,000
We had rubbed them down with a Chipotle salt kind of rub, something simple, but tasty,

542
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,400
a little bit of garlic in there too.

543
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:01,960
And then to kind of top it off, my wife Hedia made a garlic butter that we brushed on there.

544
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,920
However, that seems to have kind of been the straw that broke the camel's back.

545
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,360
It's a bit more, uh, uh, what do you call it?

546
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,360
Grease fire.

547
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,760
The whole grease pan in the barbecue has caught on fire.

548
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,760
It's not, it's not our fault.

549
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,280
I was going to say more volatile than your standard kind of investment strategy.

550
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,440
Yeah, it's, it's performing more like an alt coin right now.

551
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,360
It's quite bad.

552
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,320
It's just burning out of control.

553
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Um, we did rescue the steaks.

554
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,120
So I actually think the steaks are going to be okay if maybe just a little charred around

555
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,840
the edges, but there's no rescuing this barbecue.

556
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,800
How much did you steak?

557
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,000
Brent, I am too hungry for that crap.

558
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,800
You know, the listeners can't see like the actual billowing black smoke that was emanating

559
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,800
here.

560
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Yeah.

561
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,900
I don't think anybody's cleaned out the grease trap in that barbecue in about five years.

562
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,240
There were large flames.

563
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,200
We were worried there for a sec.

564
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
Yeah.

565
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,080
We got the, the flames got big enough.

566
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,080
They were like, do we have to worry about the back draft factor when we open this thing

567
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,840
to put it out?

568
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,680
Is that going to be a problem?

569
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,800
We did forget about the, Oh, what did they call those?

570
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,680
Uh, uh, oh, soy, soy Rizzo.

571
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,680
Soy Rizzo.

572
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,680
I got myself some soy Rizzo sausage to, uh, put on the grill as well.

573
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,000
And, uh, somehow we totally forgot about them the entire time we were grilling.

574
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,120
So they got just roasted during that fire.

575
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:36,080
Well I checked on them a little bit before the fire and they were still fine.

576
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,760
But the fire really billowed up the back of the barbecue and it really got those.

577
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,160
What you're saying is Brent, you know, the fire, it just, it was just right on your food

578
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
only.

579
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
I don't know how to explain it.

580
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:52,120
It was some spicy food, greasy, spicy food.

581
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,660
Um, but I, I actually got some camera footage of the grease fire and so I was just looking

582
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:03,220
at it before we sat down to record and soon as we open the barbecue, um, we'll see what

583
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,220
happens.

584
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,800
We first opened it and we took some stuff off and then we put it back down and then

585
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,960
the fire really went out of control.

586
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,260
And that, that first time it was already gone, it was too late.

587
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,720
We just didn't realize that we were too focused on the potatoes.

588
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,240
Um, the Satoshi squares, which turned out to be not Satoshi squares.

589
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,660
But you know, so we had this opportunity where the audience helped get Brent down here.

590
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:27,240
We had some extra sats that we thought let's feed everybody because we really had no dinner

591
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,240
plans.

592
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,940
We've been way too busy.

593
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:36,560
So what we decided to do was use a service slash website called Bit Refill.

594
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,240
This is not a sponsorship or anything, it's just what we did.

595
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,140
And Bit Refills just sends, just sells tons and tons and tons of different digital gift

596
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,840
cards for everything, everything.

597
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,800
I mean, it's crazy.

598
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,640
And obviously they have like grocery stores on there and they have things like Instacart

599
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,800
on there.

600
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,560
And so we went the route of Instacart.

601
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,480
So we use the sats to buy an Instacart gift certificate.

602
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,160
Well, a couple of them actually, then loaded the app with that gift card and made the purchase

603
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,720
like normal.

604
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,100
So it was pretty great.

605
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,960
The only way we could have removed like a lot of step out of there would be if Instacart

606
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,680
just took lightning payments directly.

607
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:22,120
Yeah, that's the funniest part is like of all the steps in the chain and there's a few,

608
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,320
the actual lightning payment, you know, like once you get the invoice and then you can

609
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,240
fill it out in your app, that's by far the fastest part out of it, of all of the steps.

610
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
Yeah.

611
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Yeah.

612
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
It's just immediate.

613
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,240
It's so great.

614
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,880
And then you have the gift card instantly, which is really awesome.

615
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,200
The UI on the apps and like loading the gift cards, that always sucks, right?

616
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,000
You gotta get the app or whatever, then their UI to do, it's always weird, but that has

617
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,160
nothing to do with the sats or the lightning.

618
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,120
So thank you for everybody who boosted into office hours and Linux unplugged.

619
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,560
The split that we set up for that gas fund is still in place.

620
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,240
And I mean, we may buy more stakes, but it still has to get home.

621
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
Yeah, that's true.

622
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Yeah.

623
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,000
I found it actually really fun to come up with different strategies to how to put these

624
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
to use.

625
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,120
So I hope we come up with some, some other, yeah.

626
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,600
One of them is, you know, like we thought like, cause everybody always mentions every

627
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,920
time we talk to people about what we're doing, people always say, well, why don't you just

628
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,560
sell them and get the cash and buy whatever you want.

629
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:18,040
We're like, well, of course we could just sell them.

630
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
That's not as much fun.

631
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
That's not the point either, is it?

632
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:27,360
Well, I want to take a moment and thank Linode for sponsoring this episode of office hours.

633
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,680
Linode.com slash Jupiter.

634
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,720
They're not only sponsoring office hours, but they're making this trip possible.

635
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,820
It gives our team a chance to reconnect.

636
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,480
We can build special content and have these special moments, but it also means we get

637
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,520
to go tour JPL.

638
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,520
And why would Linode do that?

639
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,840
Why do they, what do they get out of it?

640
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Right?

641
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,600
What they get out of it is investment in a community that's going to advocate for them.

642
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,640
They get out of it, long-term planning, long-term investments.

643
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,760
And I think that shows you the kind of thinking that they do about this stuff.

644
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,940
It's something that I really appreciate about them.

645
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,960
And it's really what drew me in as a customer.

646
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,600
And now look where that's gone, right?

647
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,840
I started using Linode over three years ago now, which is crazy.

648
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,160
I know some people been using them for longer than a decade, but I started using them just

649
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:15,160
over three years ago because I was at Texas Linux Fest and I think it was the second Texas

650
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,320
Linux Fest I'd been to.

651
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
I'm not positive.

652
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,760
I can't remember now and it wasn't going good.

653
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,360
They'd moved locations.

654
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:27,000
Most of the vendors weren't taking it very seriously.

655
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,280
Linode showed up with a great booth, people that are excited to be there.

656
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,440
They win a little above and beyond to make sure the conference could happen.

657
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,560
They spend a little extra to support them.

658
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,200
And I thought, look at them, they're really taking, I could tell Texas Linux Fest had

659
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,200
some serious potential.

660
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,000
I could tell it was one to take seriously.

661
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,440
And I thought, I can see that.

662
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,440
They see it too.

663
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,560
They see it too.

664
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,720
That is a company that actually understands community.

665
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,900
It understands free software development.

666
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,660
It understands what makes Linux tick at the real base level.

667
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,660
And that's why they're here.

668
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,840
And I'm like, next time I build something, I'm going to try it out on the node.

669
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,780
Well, now they're doing it here with us, right?

670
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,600
They're here, they're investing in something that builds community.

671
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,240
And my hope is when you're listening to this, you'll think, well, next time I want to build

672
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,640
something on really great, really fast cloud hosting, I'm going to go to Linode.

673
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,320
You go to linode.com slash Jupiter.

674
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,480
You get $100 in 60 day credit and you support the show, linode.com slash Jupiter.

675
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,680
All right, what's next on our list there, boys?

676
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,520
We talked about our trip so far.

677
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,600
We haven't made it to JPL yet.

678
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,000
Is our meetup tomorrow?

679
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,240
No, JPL is tomorrow.

680
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
The meetup is the day after.

681
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
There you go.

682
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
The same day.

683
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,280
What are we even doing over here?

684
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,280
It's all blurring together.

685
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,560
I guess we better figure that out after this.

686
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,720
But as this is releasing, it's going to be the day of the meetup.

687
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
That's true.

688
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
Yeah.

689
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,240
So hopefully it went great.

690
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,640
If you're hearing this by the time you're hearing this, hopefully it went, I'm sure

691
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
it did.

692
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,120
I'm sure it did.

693
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,440
I'm really looking forward to going to JPL and discovering all of their secrets.

694
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,240
You know what I mean?

695
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,660
You know, that makes me think we do have to drop another geocache around here somewhere.

696
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,660
We should.

697
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,660
Yeah, we should.

698
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,660
We've got to think of something.

699
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,660
Yeah, we should do that tomorrow.

700
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,760
Good thinking.

701
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,240
So between all of this, there's been some pretty solid progress on the new website.

702
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,700
We've recently published the new website that our community built for us, like the heroes

703
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,700
that they are.

704
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,700
Amazing.

705
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,200
An incredible story of value for value and community coming together to create something

706
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,500
way beyond what we could have done on our own.

707
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,360
And it continues, even during the trip.

708
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,960
Yeah, I was actually really worried.

709
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,720
I knew we'd be busy during the trip and I tried to put in, you know, as much work as

710
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,760
I could before leaving to get to the studio.

711
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,760
And that was what, like a week and a half ago, something like that now, has it been

712
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
longer?

713
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
I don't know anymore.

714
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,200
I think, yeah, a little bit longer, a couple of days longer, I don't know.

715
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
It's really a weird thing.

716
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,200
And if you, if you're not going through it, it's hard to like really wrap your head around

717
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,680
it, but everything's blurring together.

718
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,000
It reminds me a little bit of some people will know what this is like is after you have

719
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,880
children, the first few days all blur together after you have your child.

720
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,800
And that's what this road trip has been like.

721
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,560
It's all one long Monday.

722
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,560
Yeah.

723
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,280
And I, I kind of from our other road trips knew this was going to happen.

724
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,360
I know this feeling.

725
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,360
It's a familiar one.

726
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,360
It's also a very fun one.

727
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,360
It is.

728
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,040
And we, it's like we're sprinting basically.

729
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,040
Yeah.

730
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,040
And so amazing things happen.

731
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,200
We get into a bunch of projects and trouble and all sorts of adventures.

732
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,020
And I knew that I wouldn't have the same time to put into the website as I did previously

733
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:31,160
to do a bit of sort of community engagement and those kinds of things.

734
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,160
But you know what?

735
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,880
You can't approve MRs and drive a car at the same time, Brett.

736
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,360
You know, they tell me that's dangerous, but as a passenger he can, and he did.

737
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,360
It's true.

738
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,120
You know, the new dev one that I, that you, you both so generously got me, allowed me

739
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:52,120
to work in the car on the way here for like, I think I worked five or six hours.

740
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
So great.

741
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
Yeah.

742
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,520
And then when I got Joupes behind, I drove the Focus and Jeff drove his car down and

743
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,000
Brent rode with Jeff and Hadir rode with me.

744
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,980
So it just sort of worked out really nice because everybody got a, you know, a car buddy

745
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,600
and you got some work time.

746
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Yeah.

747
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,300
It was actually really great and, and nice to become reacquainted with all of the work

748
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,300
that's been happening there.

749
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,880
And I was super blown away.

750
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,040
There's been a ton of stuff happening, Chris, while you and I have just been fooling around

751
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,760
on this trip here.

752
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,360
I think there are two things that stand out for me.

753
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:28,040
First is that we have a brand new 404 page that, uh, I think hearkens to the old website

754
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,240
and an homage, if you will, an homage is a nice way to put it.

755
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,320
So it's the only, it's like the one good thing about the old website.

756
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,680
So you know, we took that and scrapped the rest, the 404 page, the fricking 404 page.

757
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,200
So thank you to CJ bass player for taking that one on and, uh, making it happen.

758
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,240
If you'd like to see it, just go to Jupiter broadcasting.com and then make up the rest.

759
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,200
Yeah, just screw it up and you'll see it.

760
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,760
It is so great.

761
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:00,280
I'm really glad we preserved that a little bit of whimsy, if you will, you got to have

762
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
fun in there somewhere.

763
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Okay.

764
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:07,800
Now there's a part I've been waiting to, to give them more information about the workflow

765
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,480
that gets rid of the cowboy in the room, which apparently is me.

766
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,440
So tell me about this new workflow that's designed to protect everybody from Chris.

767
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,520
I thought you were a prospector prospector, Chris.

768
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
Yeah.

769
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,680
So tell me about get flow and how we're using it to do smarter development.

770
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
Yeah.

771
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:28,640
We've had many discussions about, okay, so up to this point we like cowboys, not just

772
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:35,840
you, Chris, all of us have just been iterating very quickly on the website and all PRS have

773
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,320
been just kind of modifying our main branch and that's been okay, but I think it's time

774
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:48,000
that we mature a little bit and maybe protect a few important gems.

775
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,120
So we've been having discussions in our issues and via the matrix room for, Oh, it feels

776
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:59,240
like a month now on how to address this and what are the best ways to, you know, get some

777
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,080
perhaps live previews of some of the development that's happening without having to publish

778
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,080
to production, which, you know, sounds like actually a really good idea not to screw things

779
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,080
up.

780
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:16,800
And so I think the one that we've settled on is get flow and Wes, could you help me

781
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,120
wrap my head around what this is doing for us?

782
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:23,460
I think I've begun to understand it, but it sounds like you've got a little bit more experience

783
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,460
than I do in this one.

784
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:29,800
Well, I think some of your aim here, right, was to have an environment that you could

785
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,720
merge PRS directly into before having to take that and deploy it to the main website, right?

786
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,360
So you could have a staging environment of some kind where you could merge things together,

787
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,000
integrate multiple different PRS of, you know, the different work, different changes, configuration

788
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,520
kits, new features, evaluate that as a consistent release, you know, and then at periodic times

789
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,520
sort of cut that over and promote that, deploy it to the main branch, put it in production.

790
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,080
Is that the idea that you were kind of going for?

791
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,080
Exactly.

792
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,080
Yeah.

793
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:05,720
And I think what I'm noticing now is some of the problems that we're tackling on the

794
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,400
website are multifaceted and sometimes many PRS are interacting.

795
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,720
And so if you're just pushing one to main, well, maybe that actually breaks things before

796
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,280
you get to push a few others.

797
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:22,800
So it sounds like maybe a much nicer way to solve some complex, niggly problems that maybe

798
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,960
we're going to face in just a little bit.

799
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,840
Now, you do have to be careful that you don't accumulate too many changes.

800
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:33,440
You can, you know, if you're not doing regular deploys, you could get a really big difference

801
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,440
between them.

802
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,000
You also, depending on the team size, you know, you might need folks involved.

803
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,640
I think that's less of a problem here, especially since you've been doing such a great job of

804
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,360
being informed on what's going on with the website brand.

805
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,960
If there's been a lot of features added and you're trying to do like a successful look

806
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:52,240
at did that deploy correctly, did it break anything, did it, did those new things actually

807
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,240
get added?

808
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:57,200
You need to make sure that you have all that context or people around who can help with

809
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
that.

810
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,200
Yeah.

811
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,240
I think one other advantage we're looking forward to is building in basically a live

812
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:08,440
preview of the development branch that is on the exact same infrastructure that we can,

813
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:14,760
you know, make some merges to and test things in real time without maybe that being public

814
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,920
facing.

815
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,560
I'm sure we'll make some mistakes so we don't want that to be too public.

816
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,800
You know, there's, it's always nice to have same desk.

817
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
That's for sure.

818
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
Hmm.

819
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,000
It does seem like something we probably should be doing now.

820
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Like we've reached that phase of the development cycle, which is exciting.

821
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,600
We were getting all grown up.

822
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,200
It's a successful project, right?

823
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,760
I mean, very successful.

824
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,760
Yeah.

825
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,760
It's pretty great seeing the work continue.

826
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,120
There's some things that I feel like we should probably take a minute and jump in and have

827
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,880
a conversation about with them.

828
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,600
You know, specifically just certain directions on future developments.

829
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,660
We're lucky to have that issue.

830
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:54,040
There's things that people want to build and they need information from us so they can

831
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,720
build those apps, like in some sort of consumable format.

832
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,660
And there's just a debate on how to do that.

833
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,600
And so one of the things that I always want to bring the conversation back to is we love

834
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,100
our new website.

835
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:12,920
The RSS feed whenever we can needs to be the source of truth because the website is probably

836
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,360
the smallest way people consume content from JB.

837
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:22,120
Just because we've under invested in that website for so long and we've promoted all

838
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:27,240
of the individual show sites so heavily, we've just discouraged visiting jupitabroadcasting.com.

839
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,400
I mean, until recently, officehours.hair is the URL we always mentioned, right?

840
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Right.

841
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,840
I think the main site had had the calendar and had the live page.

842
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
Yes.

843
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,560
You know, otherwise don't really need to go there.

844
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
You don't need to.

845
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,680
So we always kind of kind of keep the website is one of the endpoint destinations of the

846
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,680
information.

847
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,680
But so is the podcast apps.

848
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,320
So are YouTube.

849
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,480
So is like all these things.

850
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,080
And all of that needs to be really driven from the RSS feed.

851
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,280
The RSS feed needs to be the source of truth for all of that.

852
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,240
And so we just need to build things with that in mind.

853
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,560
And just kind of keep repeating that mantra is the RSS feed needs to be the source of

854
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,080
truth.

855
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,840
That is essential for a podcast.

856
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:10,160
You know, that the RSS feed is our radio signal.

857
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,280
We are the RSS feed really, right?

858
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,080
I mean, yeah, yeah.

859
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:20,120
And just so grateful for the fact that we can be really heads down on something like

860
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,120
this.

861
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,680
And to have just things like that 404 page actually just get completely pushed out and

862
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:29,880
developed while we're out here doing this just.

863
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,040
And there are certainly other PRs that have been created and merged in that time.

864
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,920
And I have been not involved at all.

865
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,440
So a huge thank you to El Rey for kind of taking the reins and and keeping things flowing

866
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,900
nicely for the community.

867
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,960
So another shout out to El Rey once again.

868
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,400
You know, I think we have a boost from El Rey too.

869
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,440
So why don't we get into the boost?

870
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,660
And now it is time for the boost.

871
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,840
And our first boost actually comes in from true grits who sent in an enterprise boost

872
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:07,280
of 1701 sats says belated congrats on the new website.

873
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,040
I just checked it out and it looks much nicer.

874
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,280
Thank you for the feedback.

875
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,840
I love the people are still like going out and checking it out.

876
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,840
That true grits you know, that's that's a booster of high taste I think speaking of

877
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:25,880
the Star Trek boost, the enterprise boost, we found a all Star Trek TNG channel and that's

878
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,220
the only we've never changed it.

879
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,220
We got here.

880
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:32,360
I had it on within five minutes of being at the Airbnb and it's literally been on the

881
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
entire time.

882
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,920
The amazing thing, too, is it started with episode one encounter at Farpoint when I turned

883
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,920
on the TV.

884
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,080
It was and it's been going chronologically the entire time.

885
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:48,040
Now they're into season two except for they skipped Tasha dying skin of evil.

886
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,040
I don't know why they skipped that episode, but they just skipped right over Tasha yard.

887
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
She just disappeared.

888
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,040
Yeah.

889
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,760
And in the Pluto TV Star Trek parallel universe version, Tasha are still alive.

890
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,720
She just hasn't shown up to work for a few days.

891
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,720
Thank you.

892
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,480
True Grits gene being boosted in with a lead set of sats and gene being writes, Have you

893
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:14,180
ever considered using J.B. as a business that is an alternative to fireside and other parts

894
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,160
of podcasting infrastructure?

895
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,680
You know, the way you can maybe monetize some of the work and learnings you guys have done

896
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,680
on the back end.

897
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:25,080
What do you think, Wes, should we should we take everything that's been built on the back

898
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,680
end and bring it up to the market and compete with fireside and all the others?

899
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,560
I don't know about compete, but there's a lot of good ingredients in there.

900
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,560
That's true.

901
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,620
I don't think we have the you know, we don't have any of the perks to offer, like your

902
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,120
Spotify's and your other closed platforms.

903
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,840
And it's a little tricky because there are already specifically a few like podcasting

904
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:50,920
2.0 tools and other platforms that exist that I think if you're doing one or two shows would

905
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,360
work pretty well.

906
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,640
And fireside and a few of the other competitors are hitting that market, but also a market

907
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,200
that's a little above that.

908
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,320
And I don't know if that higher market is interested in the like self hosted or like

909
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,800
free and open source nature necessarily of the tools and platforms as as we are.

910
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,480
Are you saying we're a bit of a niche?

911
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,280
Yeah, we definitely like to push the edge on the features.

912
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,800
Is that the other thing is, is those services can live and die on their UI.

913
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,520
We do not fuss a lot about UI for our tools or audio or audio.

914
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,680
And then the other thing that that strikes me about it besides the pricing and how tricky

915
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:37,040
that would be is, you know, the thing that we could focus on and feels pretty within

916
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:43,480
our reach would be to kind of package up the website stuff and say, hey, if you're looking

917
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,600
for a kind of out of the box website for a podcast, especially like a network that has

918
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,680
a couple of podcasts because man, there's nothing out there for podcast networks.

919
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,680
Nothing out there.

920
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,680
Yeah, right.

921
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,680
That has that notion built right in now.

922
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,760
Yeah, so I almost feel like if we were to refine the focus a little bit that we could

923
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,640
actually achieve and really somebody could just go fork it right now and actually just

924
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,640
just do that on their own.

925
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,920
They don't really have to do much.

926
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,000
But I think it's safe to say Gene Beans right in that, yeah, we've obviously talked about

927
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
this before.

928
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Yeah.

929
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,600
Technical issues boosted him with 5000 sats coming in hot with the boost every time he

930
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,880
says I saw Dave Jones boost this on Mastodon and I was curious about what you thought.

931
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,400
The website is Op3OP3.dev.

932
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,400
And Wes, am I right?

933
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,960
Is this sort of maybe like an open source public podcast stats tracking service?

934
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,120
Yeah, it's the Open Podcast Prefix Project.

935
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,880
That's where the three comes from.

936
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,440
And the idea is your podcast or podcast hosting company, maybe it's this fictional other spin

937
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,200
out we've just made.

938
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,520
You can prepend their little URL to the start of your normal URL.

939
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,520
It's like a redirect.

940
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,920
And then it's going to just do a quick little redirect.

941
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,760
They talk later on about, you know, their their edge locations all over the world.

942
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,640
Global CDN with 275 cities in over 100 countries.

943
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,360
Yeah, that's the one.

944
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,280
And then yeah, they they'll start collecting some metrics, you know, according to various

945
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,240
like IAB standards and such.

946
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,320
They talk about that, too.

947
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:19,440
But the metrics, they're intended to be open, privacy focused, but open.

948
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,160
So they don't expose who's doing the downloading, but they do expose the podcast numbers.

949
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,520
Once you start using this prefix, you are opening up your show's listener numbers to

950
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:33,400
the world without compromising your listeners privacy.

951
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,240
Now they do say next to that, you know, developers and companies can start building products

952
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,880
and services for you with the data without you having to manage a custom integration.

953
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,280
So maybe that's some of the angle.

954
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,960
Okay, I have some questions.

955
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,520
Why would someone want to do this?

956
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:51,560
Compared to how it's done now, which maybe we should explain as well.

957
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:56,960
It's pretty close to how it's done now with the exception of open numbers.

958
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:02,560
And it's usually either companies that are in the podcast, advertising selling business

959
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,920
or Spotify.

960
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,240
It's not like a super neutral party.

961
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:12,960
To that end, I actually think firesides one of the better metric collectors in the business.

962
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,000
I think one of the more popular ones would be pod track is also chartable, blueberry,

963
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,280
some of these that people use, and they all kind of use HTTP redirects to count download

964
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,660
numbers.

965
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:30,440
Then podcasters take that and they use those numbers to set pricing for advertisers.

966
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,760
That's where having them open could be kind of interesting.

967
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,640
I would be willing to do it if everyone else in our space did.

968
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,400
I was about to say it's one of those sort of first mover things, right?

969
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,240
Because like to play in that ecosystem, if that's how the world was already working.

970
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,840
But how do you how do you get that shift?

971
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:52,200
I can also see it inspiring a bit of animosity, a little envy, perhaps between different,

972
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,040
you know, podcasters, they're in the same niche or something like that.

973
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,600
Well, that's what I think that's where my question originates is, what's the advantage

974
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,680
other than just kind of making it transparent?

975
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:08,320
Because it seems like, to me at least, that I'm not sure really what you would get out

976
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,320
of it.

977
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,320
Yeah.

978
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,840
And I can tell you, somebody's been doing this for 15 years.

979
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,440
The download number is, I mean, it matters.

980
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:21,560
But it's one of probably five or six data points that I consider on how a show is doing.

981
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,880
And so a show that gets 10,000 downloads versus a show that gets 60,000 downloads.

982
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:31,200
Well, if you just compare them by the numbers, like, okay, for example, office hours, right,

983
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:36,700
I actually do not know what office hours download numbers are, because I don't care.

984
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,080
It's not about that.

985
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,600
It's about making a podcast for the JB audience that wants it.

986
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:45,800
And I don't care if it gets 10 downloads, look at the community that we had built around

987
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:50,920
it for like the website and helping you, you know, get gas in your tank and like it has

988
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,360
been immensely valuable for us.

989
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,400
I don't even know what the download numbers are, right?

990
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,960
What I follow is how many boosts are coming in?

991
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,600
How many emails are coming in?

992
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,760
What is the response we're getting in the matrix chat when we talk about this stuff,

993
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,760
right?

994
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,840
Well, I've noticed as well at the meetups, just how much people are mentioning certain

995
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,920
topics and service comes up.

996
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,920
Yeah.

997
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,200
And those are the kinds of numbers these days that I pay more attention to.

998
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,080
I guess if I suppose if I was trying to be really aggressive about selling ads on office

999
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:21,120
hours, I'd probably be more aware of what the numbers are.

1000
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:26,960
I'm not as much because I'm not really actively doing that as long as the boosts stay pretty

1001
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,960
decent.

1002
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,960
We'll see.

1003
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,960
You never know.

1004
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,000
It's going to be more, probably more economic tightening.

1005
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
So who knows?

1006
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,620
But I personally am a little bit like a sconce at this Op3Dev, but I would love to hear Dave's

1007
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:40,620
thoughts on it.

1008
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,120
So I might have to go dig up his post on Mastodon.

1009
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,440
So I think the pod sage would probably get me thinking a little bit more about it.

1010
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,320
And then check this out, guys, Frozier boosted in with a mega row of sticks, one hundred

1011
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:57,440
and eleven thousand stats and another hundred and eleven in there, too.

1012
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,320
That's a big number that I can barely even get out this time at night.

1013
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,920
Sounds like more stakes to me.

1014
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,920
Definitely.

1015
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:09,440
Definitely our baller booster for the night.

1016
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,840
So thank you very much, Frozer, and he just says longtime listener.

1017
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,840
Thanks for everything.

1018
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,840
Lovely.

1019
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:19,200
One of the meet ups, I don't want to give too many details, but one of the meet ups,

1020
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:26,560
we talked to a guy who was so early into Bitcoin that when he'd leave Bitcoin mining overnight

1021
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:30,520
on his PC, he'd get a block, he'd get 50 Bitcoin.

1022
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:35,080
And he was annoyed the one night when he ran it overnight and didn't get 50 Bitcoin.

1023
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,120
Oh, my goodness.

1024
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,120
Yeah.

1025
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:42,480
She's like, you know, thanks for the Bitcoin coverage.

1026
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,480
Like you're welcome.

1027
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,120
So funny.

1028
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,800
I mean, could you imagine like 50 Bitcoin a night?

1029
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:50,800
It's crazy back then.

1030
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,320
It was so crazy back then.

1031
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:57,720
Oh, I am super happy to say our next booster is our Web site star contributor that we were

1032
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,400
just talking about this week, one amongst many, but one that comes up often on this

1033
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:02,400
show.

1034
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:09,680
It is Mr. Elray who boosted in with a row of ducks, two thousand two hundred and twenty

1035
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:15,120
two sats, and Elray writes, So I was able to get money into Albi while completely on

1036
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,400
mobile.

1037
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,000
This is something we were asking.

1038
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,880
Albi is a browser extension that kind of lets you connect to your own note.

1039
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,360
It lets you bring your wallet between different applications and services.

1040
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,840
And Podverse is one of them.

1041
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,560
By the way, Podverse on Graphene OS.

1042
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,560
Thumbs up.

1043
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,560
Big thumbs up.

1044
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,560
Some foreshadowing there.

1045
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:34,560
Hmm.

1046
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,840
So Elray writes, I did have to use another app.

1047
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:40,440
I have BlueWallet, which can generate the invoices for my Albi wallet.

1048
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,840
Then I go to the pay option in the strike app.

1049
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:47,100
You'll then be able to paste the lightning request from BlueWallet.

1050
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:51,260
If you click the QR code, you'll get that and you'll get a paste option and it all sends.

1051
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,560
We were kind of playing around with this, too.

1052
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:56,680
It's like tricky to set it up once.

1053
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,920
And then once you figure out the workflow, it's super fast.

1054
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,120
Like the second time we did it, we bought like one gift card and a second gift card.

1055
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,920
Second time it was like easy peasy.

1056
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,920
Fifteen seconds.

1057
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,920
Mm hmm.

1058
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,920
The first time it took us like 10 minutes.

1059
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,920
Nice.

1060
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,920
Just figured it all out.

1061
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:14,040
You got to get the workflow and figure out how to connect the apps.

1062
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:19,800
It's an open system with an open protocol like HTTP, like SMTP.

1063
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,140
And in some cases, you're connecting multiple applications together and you're moving things

1064
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,860
around this open network to get it in the right place.

1065
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:27,860
It's just how the nature of it.

1066
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:33,160
So I really like the combination of Albi and Podverse.

1067
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,880
It sounds like another great option is the Zeus wallet to move things around.

1068
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,260
I'm going to play around with all this and come up with some official recommendations

1069
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,560
for working with Albi.

1070
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:46,680
You know what I did when while you both were recording LAN earlier today, I didn't actually

1071
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,680
share this.

1072
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,600
Chris, you're going to have to help me because this time of night, I forgot all the things

1073
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,600
I learned.

1074
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,600
But a circle.

1075
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:58,000
OK, so I have a node that some of your wonderful stats come into.

1076
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Oh, yeah.

1077
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,000
Thank you very much.

1078
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Yeah.

1079
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,880
That's so that's the node we set up for you on Linode that is in the split.

1080
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,280
So when you boost into office hours and lap, the split goes to Brent's node.

1081
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:07,820
We call it Brent's node.

1082
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:10,160
It is called Brent's node.

1083
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,160
Something like that.

1084
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,160
Only we should actually give out the actual name.

1085
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,160
No, that's fine.

1086
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,160
But it's close to Brent's node.

1087
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:17,320
So I've been kind of playing with that because, you know, we've been trying to get into that

1088
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,320
on this trip.

1089
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:24,320
And so I I Chris, you set me up with a bunch of channels to other people's nodes.

1090
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,440
And we had to play with that a little bit to try to use some of the stats that were

1091
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,440
on my node.

1092
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:33,920
And so I played today with doing some circle, a loop.

1093
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:41,680
No, I was trying to rebalance some stats on certain channels and use a circular.

1094
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,480
What is that called when you move sats from one side to the other through?

1095
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,480
OK, maybe it's called a loop.

1096
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,760
You can loop in and loop out.

1097
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:47,760
There's no no no.

1098
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:48,760
There's a ring of fire.

1099
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,760
Did you do the ring of fire?

1100
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,760
I hope so.

1101
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:51,760
Yeah, that's really cool, man.

1102
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,760
That's like a soundtrack.

1103
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,760
They're doing a ring of fire burn, burn, burn.

1104
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,760
All right.

1105
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,520
OK, so essentially what you're doing is you're sending out the stats from one channel and

1106
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,520
receiving them on another channel and kind of balancing things out.

1107
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,520
Yeah, that's exactly what it was.

1108
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,520
Yeah.

1109
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,680
But there was a name that everybody was using that I forget now and was a loop.

1110
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,440
We're just guessing shapes now.

1111
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,440
What is this show?

1112
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,440
Because was it triangle?

1113
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:17,600
It kind of sounds to me like maybe I should continue learning the square ellipse.

1114
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,600
You guys.

1115
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,600
That's great, though.

1116
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,600
That's you know, there's some people who hate that.

1117
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:25,400
I feel like it's a bit like Tamagotchi.

1118
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,400
You guys know what those are?

1119
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,400
Oh, yeah.

1120
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,400
I know a pet to have.

1121
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,400
I never really had one.

1122
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,280
But this my lightening, you know, it's kind of like my Tamagotchi pet where I checked

1123
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,280
the channel.

1124
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,280
The envy over here.

1125
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,280
Mm hmm.

1126
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,280
Mm hmm.

1127
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,880
OK, I was doing some circular rebalancing.

1128
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,880
Oh, yeah.

1129
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:39,880
OK.

1130
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,880
Hello.

1131
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,880
Yeah.

1132
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,880
OK, thanks.

1133
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:43,880
Yeah.

1134
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,960
No, actually, it's probably it's a different somebody can explain it what it is.

1135
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,960
But that's great.

1136
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:47,960
Good for you.

1137
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,960
Doing a little doing a little node maintenance.

1138
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,280
And so now you can get your outbound liquid.

1139
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,280
That's exactly it.

1140
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,280
Atta boy.

1141
00:51:53,280 --> 00:52:00,480
Well, you're going to need it because Mr. Rust, a cast of first that comes in with 10,000

1142
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,640
stats this week boost.

1143
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,680
And they write this boost is courtesy of fountain.

1144
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,960
I'm in their beta group.

1145
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,600
And because I'm providing a value of time and talent to them, they threw in some treasure

1146
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,600
my way.

1147
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,600
And I'm happy to pass that along.

1148
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,600
Well, that's amazing.

1149
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,600
Thanks, Versa.

1150
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,040
This is I've mixed feelings on how their earnings work.

1151
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,840
But at the end of the day, I'm happy it's here because it allows me to participate.

1152
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,720
I'm intimidated to go from fiat to digital currency only.

1153
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,000
I'm trying to educate myself more on the topic.

1154
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,560
But honestly, it's kind of a big leap.

1155
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,560
Don't go kissing mountains.

1156
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,560
Brent, we need you.

1157
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,560
Oh, thank you.

1158
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,560
On that one.

1159
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,360
We still need to do some repairs on Brent's car when we get back.

1160
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,360
It's true.

1161
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,400
Just a little mountain kissing just a little bit.

1162
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,040
You're only a few stones stuck in the system rocks.

1163
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,040
They're real mountains.

1164
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,280
So it's hard to resist.

1165
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,440
It's a great ride.

1166
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,840
You know, the point here is well taken rest of casta it is a little bit sketchy still

1167
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,320
to go from fiat.

1168
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,160
I love RoboSats.

1169
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,420
The great thing about RoboSats, it's on tour, so you got to go track it down.

1170
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:01,400
But when you go Google search RoboSats, you'll find educational materials like the first

1171
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,400
link.

1172
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,400
The beautiful thing about RoboSats is it's more of a human experience.

1173
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,060
I know that sounds weird, but robots in the name, right?

1174
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:14,440
The only thing that's robot is you're just kind of like a generic avatar.

1175
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,880
So when you go to RoboSats, it generates an avatar for you.

1176
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:22,040
It's a basically an encryption ID and then you can download that and save it and then

1177
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:26,200
you can come back and use that use that same avatar over and over again.

1178
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,440
So you build up a reputation, but it's not a tie.

1179
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,440
It's not tied to any ID.

1180
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,400
It just was randomly generated that one time when you loaded the website and then you go

1181
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:39,980
in and there's a buy and a sell side and the sellers will list what they're willing to

1182
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:40,980
accept as payment.

1183
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,320
And sometimes it's things like let's use the cash app.

1184
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,320
Let's use strike.

1185
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:46,320
Let's use revolt.

1186
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:51,160
I've even seen like an Amazon gift card on one because they just choose what they want.

1187
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,400
And so you go there and you initiate the trade.

1188
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:54,400
You tell them how much you want.

1189
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,640
You have to accept because they're going to have a mark up a little bit above market price.

1190
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,600
So you accept how much you're willing to trade.

1191
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:04,000
So you say, I want a thousand sats or whatever.

1192
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,320
It actually starts a chat process with that other person and you exchange a little bit

1193
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,320
information just to refine all the payment details.

1194
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,000
There's an escrow process involved so it makes sure everybody gets everything they're supposed

1195
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,720
to and you can report if you didn't get it.

1196
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,120
Of course it would affect their reputation too.

1197
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,520
And in this process you have an actual quick exchange with the person you're buying from

1198
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,520
and it ends up being a more human experience and it's not a hassle.

1199
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,200
It's just real quick.

1200
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,200
Human sets.

1201
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,200
So I like RoboSats.

1202
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,700
I really, I recognize it's not like crazy simple and straightforward and that Chris

1203
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,760
is a little bit of a weirdo here because I'm okay loading up the tour browser to go buy

1204
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:43,100
my sats, but they've also made an Umbral app.

1205
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:47,560
So if you've got Umbral now, there is a RoboSats app that you can install and run your own

1206
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,720
local RoboSats using your own node information.

1207
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,720
I just love that kind of crap, you know, I love it.

1208
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:57,160
You know, every week when we bring up our doc for this show, I think there can't be

1209
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:03,760
that much podcasting news or Bitcoin related stuff that we want to talk about, but it turns

1210
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,480
out there's always tons of, there's more super, super fascinating.

1211
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:12,720
I do want to mention as well, Rustacasta, thank you for getting involved with Fountain.

1212
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:18,220
I think getting involved in a bunch of these pieces of software that we're using is amazing.

1213
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:24,080
And that reminds me of how a bunch of our contributors to our website helped Podverse.

1214
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,080
Yeah.

1215
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,720
Chris, you had some feedback on that one.

1216
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,820
Yeah, in fact, I want to get Mitch back on the show and talk about it, but I had a nice

1217
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:37,720
note from Mitch, one of the co-creators of Podverse and one of the main developers, and

1218
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:44,560
he just said, you know, he's had a great experience from contributors who are helping just like

1219
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,520
with bugs and little things here in Podverse here and there and catch stuff.

1220
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:53,360
And he says some of the best technical contributions that they've had from outsiders to the project

1221
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:54,880
are from JB audience members.

1222
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,320
They'll say, oh yeah, I heard about it on JB and they come contribute.

1223
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,200
That is so dang cool.

1224
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,200
And we hear about it from Mitch.

1225
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,600
Like we didn't even hear about it, like the audience didn't like stop by and go, hey,

1226
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,660
guess what I did guys.

1227
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,160
They're just out there doing it, doing their thing.

1228
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,240
That's what's so great about it being open source, right?

1229
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,240
Yeah.

1230
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,240
Yeah.

1231
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,240
We already have-

1232
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,240
Long term, right?

1233
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,240
That's-

1234
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,240
Values for value, right?

1235
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,240
Yeah.

1236
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,240
Yeah.

1237
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,240
Podverse is super useful and some people can really help make it better.

1238
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,240
Yeah, definitely.

1239
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:22,280
Also just a really super quick note about Fountain and earning stats.

1240
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:26,280
They just kind of redid how the earn system works.

1241
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:31,520
It's way easier to understand and they explain it all in a blog post.

1242
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,440
So go check that out if you're earning your stats and you want to know how that works.

1243
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:39,360
And then really just super briefly, Mr. Versa actually boosted in with a double boost this

1244
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,720
week, which is so great.

1245
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:47,440
And they write, here's a new show title idea because I've been soliciting ideas from the

1246
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,640
audience on what to rename office hours because it's just a horrible show name.

1247
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,320
The idea was to talk about JB stuff and have a spot for the community to come in.

1248
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,700
That's still the idea.

1249
00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:02,680
But the problem is, is that there's a billion podcast name office hours and about 900 million

1250
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,200
of them are all about the office television show.

1251
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:09,360
And then they get in here and they're like, well, how come you guys aren't talking about

1252
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,360
the office?

1253
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,360
And I'm like, oh.

1254
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:12,360
What are your thoughts on Jim and Pam?

1255
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,360
Huh?

1256
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,360
Yeah.

1257
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,360
Yeah.

1258
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,360
Don't get me going, dude.

1259
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,880
Now here's the thing, CastaVersa had a recommendation for a new show name.

1260
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,880
Oh.

1261
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:22,880
Sats and Chats with Chris.

1262
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,880
Sats and Chats.

1263
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:24,880
That's not that far off.

1264
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,880
I don't hate it.

1265
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:26,880
I don't hate it either.

1266
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,880
I don't hate it either.

1267
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:34,760
Um, I don't think it's it, uh, but it's cute.

1268
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,760
Gets the ball rolling.

1269
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,760
That's for sure.

1270
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,760
Yeah.

1271
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,760
We need something fun though.

1272
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,760
Cause what I have in mind, I don't even want to say it's so boring, but if nobody else

1273
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,000
has a better idea, I'm going to have to go with it.

1274
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
You know?

1275
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:48,120
So Sats and Chats with Chris could be like an occasional live stream.

1276
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,120
That's true.

1277
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:52,760
Especially when we start generating our RSS feed and we get the lit tag in there so you

1278
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,760
can boost the live shows.

1279
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,960
That could be a lot of fun to sit there and answer questions and you know, just have a

1280
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,960
good old time.

1281
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,960
Hmm.

1282
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:00,960
Think about it.

1283
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,960
I like that idea though.

1284
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:03,640
Thanks for sending something in RustaCastaVersa.

1285
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:07,160
If you'd like to send a boost into the show, we'd love you to send us one with using a

1286
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:12,560
new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com and we have something special.

1287
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:20,000
Editor Drew wanted to apologize to RustaCastaVersa who was tricked into listening to an extended

1288
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,360
post show that had nothing, just dead air, and he thought something Marvel style would

1289
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,620
be coming at the end of the credits.

1290
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:28,440
So Drew's just out there trolling our audience?

1291
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:35,200
Yeah, and he actually took a second to record a clip to RustaCasta who boosted in complaining

1292
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,960
about this Marvel style rug pull.

1293
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:46,120
Dear RustaCastaVersa, yes I biffed it and I hope that you accept this meow as an apology.

1294
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,120
Meow.

1295
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,720
Man, I've never gotten a meow before.

1296
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,560
Oh, I love him so much.

1297
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:56,880
If you'd like to get a boost into the show, newpodcastapps.com, go grab a new podcast

1298
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:01,600
app that's podcasting 2.0 compatible or you can use something like your Breeze out there

1299
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,600
or Albee.

1300
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,840
In fact, you can install Albee and then just boost through our website with the podcast

1301
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,960
player that we have embedded on the website so you don't have to offer it to no one.

1302
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,960
ALBY.

1303
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:12,960
We're firing for you.

1304
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:13,960
Yeah, Albee, ALBY.

1305
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,960
Check that out.

1306
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:15,960
It's a great open source extension.

1307
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,080
All right, boys, we did it.

1308
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,080
That's it.

1309
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,080
Get done, gentlemen.

1310
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,080
Yeah.

1311
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,080
Are you ready for JPL?

1312
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:24,280
Well, first, we have to welcome our final member of the crew.

1313
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,280
That's true.

1314
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:26,280
That's true.

1315
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,480
Alex is just showing up right now as we're wrapping up the show, so we've got to get

1316
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,360
out of here so we can go say hi to Alex.

1317
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:32,520
Also, everyone needs their beds back.

1318
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,520
Yeah, there's that.

1319
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,520
He's going to go get in.

1320
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,160
Oh, I wish we could have recorded that.

1321
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:39,960
Alex seeing his room just totally ripped apart.

1322
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,960
No bed.

1323
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:41,960
No blankets.

1324
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:42,960
No pillows.

1325
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,800
He's got the best internet in the house, though.

1326
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:45,800
So there's that.

1327
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,960
All right, everybody, office hours is over.

1328
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,960
We'll see you back from the Pacific Northwest in a couple of weeks.

1329
00:59:51,960 --> 01:00:19,040
Get out of here.
