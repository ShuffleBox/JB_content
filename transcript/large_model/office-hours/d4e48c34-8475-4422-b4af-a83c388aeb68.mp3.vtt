00:00.000 --> 00:04.000
I'm starting to learn Python because I thought it might be a useful thing.

00:04.000 --> 00:07.600
It is a useful thing. What's your use case? You got any ideas?

00:07.600 --> 00:11.920
Well, I think that's the best question of them all. I don't have a well-defined use case,

00:11.920 --> 00:18.240
but what I'm what I've been looking at this week is what are the general use tools in the world of,

00:18.240 --> 00:23.360
you know, what we're doing that might be good to know even just a little bit about. So have just

00:23.360 --> 00:27.760
a base knowledge about Ansible, for instance, have a base knowledge about Python, have a base

00:27.760 --> 00:32.720
knowledge about Git, because I think Git is fabulous. I'd like to know a little bit more

00:32.720 --> 00:37.280
about it, but I don't have an everyday use for it yet. But how do you build in an everyday use for

00:37.280 --> 00:42.000
it if you don't even know what it's capable of? So it's more of like dipping the toe in and seeing

00:42.000 --> 00:47.280
what it might be able to do for me. And Python seems like an easy place to start. It's useful

00:47.280 --> 00:52.720
for a bunch of different types of problems. Relatively easy to learn, it seems. And Wes has

00:52.720 --> 00:58.400
like tons of advice for that. So he and I were going off yesterday with he's like, oh, you should

00:58.400 --> 01:04.800
try this, too. Oh, and if you need a repl, try this repl. It's really great. And we yeah, he's

01:05.760 --> 01:10.000
such a great resource. So anyways, that's great. Yeah, that is great. Even if I do nothing with it,

01:10.000 --> 01:14.240
this whole process is fun. I encourage this. I think that is really great. I think just getting

01:14.240 --> 01:17.920
a base understanding of that kind of stuff is really is super beneficial. Kind of get a better

01:17.920 --> 01:21.920
understanding of the language, too. Yeah. And you never know when you're going to come across a use

01:21.920 --> 01:28.880
case for Python. Last night, I was reviewing different applications to extract information

01:28.880 --> 01:34.800
from the Starlink dish. And there's a huge Python library somebody's created that essentially

01:34.800 --> 01:39.840
handles all of the interfacing with the dish. And you just pass this thing a simple request.

01:39.840 --> 01:45.600
And that Python library does all of the complicated back end communications to Dishy.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.760
And, you know, there I am just randomly looking at tools to pull off pull off stats.

01:49.760 --> 01:53.600
And, you know, going down a Python rabbit hole. So it happens all the time. Well,

01:53.600 --> 01:58.960
and that's kind of what I've noticed is that a lot of these, like, do it yourself kind of

01:59.920 --> 02:03.920
micro hacks, maybe I'll call them tend to be written in Python, because it's just like,

02:03.920 --> 02:10.720
seems like it's relatively easy to get into. It's extensible, obviously, which you were just saying

02:10.720 --> 02:16.960
someone wrote a module for it. And, and it seems pretty ubiquitous, depending on the types of

02:16.960 --> 02:21.120
problems you're solving, whether it's I guess, it's used a lot in the gaming industry quite a

02:21.120 --> 02:26.800
bit. And also in machine learning stuff. So everywhere, dude, everywhere, everywhere. Well,

02:26.800 --> 02:32.320
ansible on the back end is Python. So I thought, well, geez, like, some of the best tools out there

02:32.320 --> 02:36.320
are using Python to do things. So maybe I can get a basic understanding of it just to.

02:37.680 --> 02:42.480
But I do now that I'm talking about it with you, which is always helpful. I'm noticing a trend in

02:42.480 --> 02:47.200
these things I'm trying to learn, which is automation. Ansible has a way of automating things.

02:47.200 --> 02:52.880
Python is a way of automating stuff. Git can help you automate a bunch of things. So maybe that's

02:52.880 --> 02:57.600
where I'm headed. I could see that. I could see that's a good area to get into. It's a bigger and

02:57.600 --> 03:01.680
bigger area as infrastructure gets bigger and bigger. I think personally, even I'm just getting

03:01.680 --> 03:07.280
tired of re remaking all my infrastructure from time to time. So yeah, there's that too, huh?

03:07.280 --> 03:12.160
Yeah. Well, the whole NixOS challenge, you know, changed my way of seeing the world.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.400
Office hours with me, Chris.

03:20.560 --> 03:26.640
Hey, welcome into the office. Make yourself comfortable. Twice a month. I open the doors

03:26.640 --> 03:31.520
up and I let the people in. And of course, Brent, he's always here, too. He's got himself his own

03:31.520 --> 03:36.160
little seat. Hey there, Brent. Well, hello. That's cozy in here this week. I appreciate

03:36.160 --> 03:41.520
you making it cozy. Well, you know, you take the time. You like the fire. The stuffed animals are

03:41.520 --> 03:45.840
a nice touch. Is the bunk bed a little bit too much? No, man. We'll take a nap after the show.

03:45.840 --> 03:51.200
I think it's going to be great. So I appreciate it. We got a packed show today. In fact, I just

03:51.200 --> 03:56.400
kind of decided to just I just struck a few things from the from the show notes. Just had to make

03:56.400 --> 04:03.360
room. I had to make room because I wanted to start with your recent experience about trying to

04:03.360 --> 04:10.480
improve your network connectivity, because you're out in what basically would be the idyllic scene

04:10.480 --> 04:16.160
setting for like a movie that takes place in the mountains with beautiful scenery,

04:16.160 --> 04:21.360
just gorgeous, gorgeous atmosphere. But unfortunately, kind of tricky for high speed

04:21.360 --> 04:27.200
Internet. And that is a constant thing that we're battling with. And so you did some what?

04:27.200 --> 04:31.040
What, some upgrades? I think you better start from the beginning and kind of explain to us how you

04:31.040 --> 04:34.080
get connected to the Internet and then tell us what you did to fix it and upgrade it.

04:34.720 --> 04:40.000
You know what I mean? I do. Yeah. So just picture a little cabin tucked away

04:40.000 --> 04:44.640
somewhere in the Canadian Rockies. And I'm living on a property with my brother. So he has a house

04:44.640 --> 04:53.600
maybe 100 paces that way. And so the way we get Internet is, hmm. It's like Starlink before

04:53.600 --> 04:59.760
Starlink came. So there's a tower on the mountain that you could see out in the field over there.

04:59.760 --> 05:05.200
So we get wireless point to point connectivity, line of sight kind of stuff to the other mountain

05:05.840 --> 05:09.600
on the other side of the valley. Now, is this a it's like an actual Wisp,

05:09.600 --> 05:14.960
a business or is this like an acquaintance? It's a business, thankfully. They were recently bought

05:14.960 --> 05:20.080
out. So there's a lot of confusion on their end as far as which customers should be getting what.

05:21.040 --> 05:25.200
Luckily, that's playing in our favor in this case. But they've just basically forgot about us for a

05:25.200 --> 05:31.840
long time. And so when I moved here, I thought, oh, geez, I'm used to like fiber is what I used

05:31.840 --> 05:38.960
to have. And so I knew it would be a compromise being here. And it was OK, like I could do most

05:38.960 --> 05:43.040
things. It's not the first time I've lived in the middle of nowhere trying to run off

05:43.040 --> 05:46.880
cell signal or something like that. The downside, I think here as well,

05:46.880 --> 05:53.840
is that my cell reception is equally bad. So it was fine. Everything was fine. We were doing

05:53.840 --> 05:58.480
all of our shows, Chris, through audio and everything seemed fine. And then a few weeks ago,

05:58.480 --> 06:04.000
we decided to jump to doing some fun video stuff. And that's when I think we really started testing

06:04.000 --> 06:09.120
my network because it didn't really have to work very hard before. And now it's really cooking.

06:10.480 --> 06:16.240
And I came to the realization that my network just wasn't going to cut it. It was fine in the

06:16.240 --> 06:22.160
evenings to like, you know, stream TV shows at like 480p or something. But this is not good

06:22.160 --> 06:27.280
enough, I think, especially when I'm now uploading a bunch of video to you. And my upload is like

06:27.280 --> 06:32.560
a tenth of what the download is. So it was a pretty, pretty bad shape. So it's been about

06:32.560 --> 06:38.960
two years that my brother and I have been wanting to perform upgrades because the little dish that's

06:38.960 --> 06:47.120
hanging off of his roof when the installer put it in. They did an extremely bad job.

06:47.120 --> 06:52.000
Oh, go figure. I'm going to describe it to you and you can feel badly for me.

06:52.000 --> 06:58.080
So the tower is on the west side of the house, but the dish for some reason was placed on the

06:58.080 --> 07:02.880
east side of the house because that was the easiest way to lay out cables on the exterior

07:02.880 --> 07:06.320
of the building. You know, these installers, they just drill holes in your building and they just

07:07.600 --> 07:14.720
run wires wherever they want. But also the the mast that they placed the dish on was just too

07:14.720 --> 07:19.840
short for the like the incline of the roof. So the the dish itself was actually pointing

07:19.840 --> 07:28.960
at the metal roof trying to reach the basically the the the mass that's on the mountain over there.

07:28.960 --> 07:34.000
But it couldn't aim low enough because, you know, there's a valley between us. It couldn't aim low

07:34.000 --> 07:39.040
enough. So it was like bouncing off of the metal roof to try to get signal. You were never going

07:39.040 --> 07:44.880
to get what you were paying for ever with that. No, no, not even close. And we knew that we knew,

07:44.880 --> 07:48.320
OK, this is a terrible setup. It can only get better from here. But we you know,

07:48.320 --> 07:52.960
you got to climb on the roof and we had to come up with a way of extending the mast as well.

07:54.000 --> 07:59.600
So it took us about two years to have a great enough reason to do that. And thankfully,

07:59.600 --> 08:05.120
JB toying with video was the the reason. And so we got on the roof the other day.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.920
We got on the roof the other day. Well, we got on the roof the other day.

08:09.920 --> 08:14.320
And luckily, we had thought about this and had some parts. So we bought an extension

08:14.320 --> 08:19.280
to put on the mast. And when I moved to this cabin, it had a do you remember satellite dishes?

08:19.280 --> 08:24.240
Everybody had them to get like fancy TV back in the day. Well, there was one hanging off this

08:24.240 --> 08:29.120
cabin. And so I was able to take the mast from that, get a grinder, cut it in half and just take

08:29.120 --> 08:35.840
the vertical section of it. And we had a union and connected that to the existing mast for the

08:35.840 --> 08:41.760
Internet dish. So we were able to raise it about two feet, which is great. But,

08:41.760 --> 08:44.880
you know, this is a really sensitive piece of equipment. You just can't just take it off,

08:44.880 --> 08:48.640
throw it on and expect it to be pointed at the right place. It's very, very directional.

08:49.760 --> 08:57.120
So luckily, we were able to call the Wisp, the ISP, and got the best guy on the phone ever.

08:57.120 --> 09:02.720
It was like some surfer dude guy that's usually out in the field making doing installations and

09:02.720 --> 09:07.680
stuff. And he's just like, Hey, how can I help you? He's like, Oh, yeah, I'm usually in the field,

09:07.680 --> 09:12.400
but I just happen to be in the office today and nobody else is around. And so I could totally

09:12.400 --> 09:17.040
help you guys if you want, like, what do you need, like an hour of my time or something? Is that

09:17.040 --> 09:22.400
about what you need? So it was great, because he as an installer could totally visualize exactly

09:22.400 --> 09:25.840
what we were doing, you know, hanging off the roof, trying to trying to do all this stuff. And

09:25.840 --> 09:30.800
he could guide us and be like, No, no, just do, you know, let's, let's use this method to try to

09:30.800 --> 09:35.520
point the satellite and stuff. And and the other great thing was that he was able to give us in

09:35.520 --> 09:42.880
real time the signal from their antenna on the mountain. So instead of us, you know, trying to

09:42.880 --> 09:46.240
do speed tests or something from here to try to get that data, he was able to give it to us real

09:46.240 --> 09:52.480
time. So it was amazing. He basically gave us a baseline, which is the internet connectivity that

09:52.480 --> 09:58.560
we had previously. And he gave us he's like, okay, we measure a bunch of stuff, but it kind of

09:58.560 --> 10:04.080
combines it into like a quasi score. And he said, basically, you're getting like a one out of eight.

10:04.080 --> 10:09.200
score. And if we go to a new install, to try to see if it's possible, and we get a one out of eight,

10:09.200 --> 10:13.600
we don't give those people service, because they're not going to be happy with anything. So

10:14.080 --> 10:20.400
you guys have been running on like our worst coverage for years. And anything we do can just

10:20.400 --> 10:26.240
get better. Wow, in terms of speeds for our baseline during the day was the best because the

10:26.240 --> 10:31.760
tower wasn't. I'm probably the only person using the tower during the day. At night was worse,

10:31.760 --> 10:36.240
because you know, everybody's doing the Netflix thing or something. So during the day, I was

10:36.240 --> 10:45.200
probably getting like 15 megabits down, and maybe one up. But in the evenings was actually the worst

10:45.200 --> 10:51.440
because it the stability went way down. We couldn't even watch videos at 480p sometimes, like

10:51.440 --> 10:55.280
depending on the weather and stuff like that. So he said, anything we do is just going to get

10:55.280 --> 11:00.480
better. So luckily, we you know, my brother and I, we got on the roof and extended this thing and

11:00.480 --> 11:09.120
called surfer dude back and he helped us turn the dish and get it all optimized. And now, now we

11:09.120 --> 11:15.280
have an eight out of eight signal. Whoa, which is fabulous. Well, we have we could see the tower

11:15.280 --> 11:19.920
over there. And that's how we knew it was pointed. Our dish wasn't pointed very well, right? It's

11:19.920 --> 11:27.040
like, well, actually, it's over there. And it's totally missing it. So we have a very good line

11:27.040 --> 11:32.960
of sight. We just didn't have the right setup to take advantage of that. And so I think we're doing

11:32.960 --> 11:39.200
far better now. You know, despite my getting on the roof and hanging off my fingernails for a

11:39.200 --> 11:43.040
little bit, I didn't get any you asked me like, Oh, try to get some audio because it could be

11:43.040 --> 11:47.520
really great. And he would have been awesome to have a little audio bite of but I gotta say I

11:48.800 --> 11:54.640
was feeling busy on the roof doing stuff that I didn't quite get a chance to grab some so

11:54.640 --> 12:00.800
apologies for one there, but you use your imagination. So I will say now our speeds aren't

12:01.840 --> 12:09.040
way like they're not magnitudes better. So I'm getting like 25 down and two up. But surfer dude

12:09.040 --> 12:14.400
says that's pretty much their limit, which actually, we're not even subscribed to that. So he

12:14.400 --> 12:20.000
said like, because because there was a buyout, you guys are kind of like grandfathered in you're not

12:20.000 --> 12:23.280
supposed to be on that plan, but I'm just not going to touch anything. So as the instructor

12:23.280 --> 12:26.080
he was like, I'm not going to send you to sales because they're going to catch that they're going

12:26.080 --> 12:31.200
to change things. So I'm just gonna leave it like that. But he did say the difference for you guys

12:31.200 --> 12:36.720
now is going to be priority. So he said, the way it works is that if you have one out of eight

12:36.720 --> 12:42.000
signal, you're on the bottom of the list for priority traffic. And he said, now you're one

12:42.000 --> 12:45.840
of the best signals on that tower. So you're going to get the best priority out of anybody

12:45.840 --> 12:50.720
connecting. And that's exactly what we've seen super stable at any time of the day. So I think

12:50.720 --> 12:55.040
it was totally worth it. Wow, that's interesting to the way they prioritize it, depending on your

12:55.040 --> 12:58.080
signal, because in some ways, you'd think that people with the weakest signal would need the

12:58.080 --> 13:04.960
most help. But nice work. You know, those things, it's like a lot of work for a, an improvement,

13:04.960 --> 13:09.840
but not like a complete solution. Right. And of course, the tricky thing too, is you can do all

13:09.840 --> 13:15.600
of that work, make your connection really solid, you know, your now your connection to your whisk

13:15.600 --> 13:21.120
could be as ideal, but then there still can be issues on the land side or on a wifi side that

13:21.120 --> 13:25.520
have to be worked out because any kind of remote constant communications, like I'm sure people that

13:25.520 --> 13:30.320
are doing work from home have experienced this. I know I did. Wifi issues can, can, can really

13:30.320 --> 13:36.480
plague you even with a good internet connection. I was working at a cloud guru when the very

13:36.480 --> 13:42.480
beginnings of the work from home lockdowns started. It was super common for the first few months

13:42.480 --> 13:48.000
that you'd always have somebody who just joined the video meeting who had really bad wifi because

13:48.000 --> 13:53.920
they hadn't, they hadn't been doing zoom calls from home on the regular, like people who typically

13:53.920 --> 13:57.360
work from home had, who had their whole setups already figured out. All of a sudden you had all

13:57.360 --> 14:02.160
these folks that had done all that stuff from the office. Now all of a sudden having to do it from

14:02.160 --> 14:06.480
home and they just found out that even though this is something that happens over and over again,

14:06.480 --> 14:12.240
they were paying for like this great internet service. They had horrible wifi and they had to

14:12.240 --> 14:15.840
and they kept dropping off the calls, right? And they're not even taking advantage of it.

14:15.840 --> 14:20.320
Well, and this is true for my neighbor too. She, she pays Comcast something like 80 bucks a month

14:20.320 --> 14:28.800
for her internet. I was over there and her wifi, her router just crashed and rebooted. And of course

14:28.800 --> 14:33.520
her, her phone or, you know, whatever just automatically connects to the next open wifi.

14:34.160 --> 14:39.440
Well, that's her neighbor's ring camera. That's waiting to be upset, waiting to be set up. Yeah.

14:39.440 --> 14:45.120
Yeah. So her router crashes, then her phone connects to the next open wifi AP,

14:45.120 --> 14:49.840
which is a ring device just waiting to be configured. And then she doesn't get any

14:49.840 --> 14:53.200
internet even once her router comes back online because her phone doesn't switch back.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.800
Oh my goodness.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.000
She's like, oh yeah, it happens all the time.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.840
For how long? That's for as long as I've had it. Yeah. I'm like, okay, all right.

15:00.480 --> 15:01.520
That is crazy.

15:01.520 --> 15:05.120
I just couldn't, right? But it's funny you're, you're messing around with all of this

15:05.120 --> 15:10.480
because not just last night, I went down the rabbit hole of figuring out an extension pole

15:11.280 --> 15:17.040
and suction cup mounts and all kinds of twist mounts to, to tie a, you know, a thing to a pole

15:17.040 --> 15:25.200
and 3d printed Starlink adapters because I've decided I'm going to attempt to install my Starlink

15:25.200 --> 15:30.560
via an extendable flagpole from a Harbor Freight, the 20 foot extendable flagpole.

15:30.560 --> 15:37.040
And then I will attach industrial grade window suction cups to that and, and suction it to the

15:37.040 --> 15:41.600
side of JOOPS with a, also a floor, a ground stand. I'm going to put the Starlink up over

15:41.600 --> 15:46.320
JOOPS's roof that way. I've thought about different ways. I don't have a ladder to mount

15:46.320 --> 15:51.760
the Starlink to, which is what most RVers do. But in the process of trying to figure out what my

15:51.760 --> 15:57.120
options were for people who don't have ladders, I ended up discovering this Starlink for RVers

15:57.120 --> 16:02.320
Facebook group, which I haven't done a Facebook group thing ever, literally ever. Well, maybe not

16:02.320 --> 16:06.640
true. Maybe once ever. I mean, it's like, I haven't logged into Facebook. So I had to go through

16:06.640 --> 16:13.280
this whole process of like recovering my Facebook account and identifying myself to Facebook and all

16:13.280 --> 16:17.360
of this, just so I could get access to this resource. Oh, it was the worst man. You're

16:17.360 --> 16:21.440
motivated. I was very motivated because I was really trying to put all this together so that

16:21.440 --> 16:24.960
way I could hopefully get it in time for Montana. You know, cause I'm leaving for Montana and I'm

16:24.960 --> 16:30.320
leaving for Montana in a couple of weeks and we've never really had internet where we've gone,

16:30.320 --> 16:35.840
which has been good and bad. It's good from a turning it off for a couple of days, which I could

16:35.840 --> 16:40.240
still do just by not turning on the Starlink, but it's bad from like a running your business

16:40.240 --> 16:45.600
standpoint. So my thought was, is this will be the first year we go to Montana with Starlink.

16:46.160 --> 16:50.320
And I want to have a way to get it up above tree lines because you really don't want to have

16:50.320 --> 16:55.360
anything blocking it, or you're going to have dropped packets, anything. These posts just have

16:55.360 --> 17:01.360
like a lot of good information, including all these crazy ways that different people are

17:01.360 --> 17:05.680
installing the Starlink on their mobile setups and then deploying them on the roofs of their

17:05.680 --> 17:12.480
rigs and whatnot. Tons of inspiring stuff. So I got back on Facebook for the first time in like

17:12.480 --> 17:18.080
a hundred years and it was arduous, but I too have been playing around with polls.

17:18.080 --> 17:22.640
And getting up on roofs. I have more to do too. Well, you're going to have to update us on how

17:22.640 --> 17:29.120
yours goes once you get to Bozeman. Cause, uh, I would imagine it would be pretty great if it

17:29.120 --> 17:33.200
worked great, but I would also imagine, you know, it's not tested and you can't really test it till

17:33.200 --> 17:36.640
we get there. So you might have to do some troubleshooting on site. Definitely one of

17:36.640 --> 17:41.680
those things. Definitely one of those things. Well, so I wanted to talk about our peer tube

17:41.680 --> 17:45.200
a little bit. You down for that? Oh yeah. I can't wait to hear all the stuff you guys have been

17:45.200 --> 17:49.600
doing. I know a little bit about it, but give me, give me the meat. We mentioned it on luck. We've,

17:49.600 --> 17:54.960
we've relaunched Jupiter dot tube and I'm coming at it with a whole new attack angle. So if you're

17:54.960 --> 17:59.120
not familiar, we launched this about a year and a half ago and then I shut it down and I listed a

17:59.120 --> 18:03.200
bunch of reasons why. And back then I was trying to use it for each individual show. I was going to

18:03.200 --> 18:06.800
have a channel for every show, which needed an account for every show. And there wasn't a way

18:06.800 --> 18:12.080
to automate it. And, uh, that was horrible. But now I've had a rethink and I've, I've decided

18:12.080 --> 18:16.960
just using it for live and special events or maybe a special one off video production. We do

18:17.680 --> 18:22.800
hedging for the eventuality when I shut down all of my Google accounts, but also giving us a

18:22.800 --> 18:26.880
decentralized media distribution platform. And that's something I've been focused on a lot this

18:26.880 --> 18:33.440
year. Decentralized community with matrix, decentralized value with boosts and decentralized

18:33.440 --> 18:38.000
media. Now with peer tube, I think this is a big deal. Plus I figure with more people working from

18:38.000 --> 18:43.120
home, we should probably try to have a product that addresses that crowd. Somebody who wants to

18:43.120 --> 18:47.840
watch from their desk. Somebody also who's probably been listening for a while and maybe would like

18:47.840 --> 18:51.280
to switch to the behind the scenes feed. And this has really just been part of something that we've

18:51.280 --> 18:56.800
been working on since I'd say the beginning of the year. It's decentralization, decentralization of

18:56.800 --> 19:00.640
everything that we can that makes sense. And so, uh, and I love, I like the fact there's no

19:00.640 --> 19:04.800
takedown bots. I like the fact that it's a free software stack. I like the idea that we have a

19:04.800 --> 19:09.360
place. You always know you can go to, to catch an archive version of a live show if you'd like,

19:09.360 --> 19:13.600
you know, that kind of stuff. Um, but there's, there's other motivations too. The podcasting

19:13.600 --> 19:18.800
2.0 community is working on baking in live streaming into apps and peer tube might be some

19:18.800 --> 19:22.800
of the plumbing that makes that possible. So I want to be there for that. I think when you add

19:22.800 --> 19:28.400
work from home, when you add the decentralized aspect of it, when you add the kind of strategic

19:28.400 --> 19:32.640
nature of hedging against Google and creating an outlet that's going to be able to do that,

19:32.640 --> 19:37.280
of hedging against Google and creating an outlet that people know to go to over the years. And then

19:38.000 --> 19:44.640
the, the long-term integration with the podcasting 2.0 apps, that was pretty good motivating. You

19:44.640 --> 19:48.720
know, there was some, that was, that was enough, but then we got a really solid response from our

19:48.720 --> 19:55.680
community on helping us admin it and manage it. So I'm going to be creating a matrix peer tube

19:55.680 --> 19:59.520
room for Jupiter broadcasting, like a JB peer tube room where we can kind of organize in there.

19:59.520 --> 20:04.000
And I'll put a link to that in the show notes for this episode. So for those of you who are

20:04.000 --> 20:08.240
interested in participating, I think, you know, there's a lot of things we could talk about,

20:08.240 --> 20:13.840
maybe opening this up to logins via some sort of OAuth or mastered on login. We could talk about

20:14.480 --> 20:19.360
potentially limited community publishing of certain videos. I don't know about that. I don't

20:19.360 --> 20:22.720
know. There's a lot we could discuss. I'm willing to, I'm willing to go there, but so we'll create

20:23.520 --> 20:27.200
a separate peer tube matrix room, which we'll have linked in the show notes.

20:27.200 --> 20:32.160
I think we should also create a, um, good hub issues for our peer tube instance. That way we

20:32.160 --> 20:36.000
can track a bunch of stuff there. I'll have that to my docket. If you think it's a good idea.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.920
Totally. Thank you. That would be great.

20:37.920 --> 20:42.320
I was curious cause, uh, JB has done video previously. So is that going to change the

20:42.320 --> 20:46.240
way we do things on the audio front by, by chance?

20:46.240 --> 20:49.120
No, not this time. So that's probably the biggest difference this time around

20:49.920 --> 20:56.160
is we're going to stick to audio first production. All our release episodes are going to be audio.

20:56.160 --> 21:00.960
We're all still doing multi-track recording, multi-track editing. We still have drew cleaning

21:00.960 --> 21:06.400
this up, processing the audio, mastering and mixing it, publishing it. All of that still remains.

21:06.400 --> 21:10.720
These are, these are going to be more like behind the scenes feeds with just a little bit extra,

21:10.720 --> 21:15.920
because for the first 10 years of JB, I did a lot of, a lot of live switching. That's just sort of

21:15.920 --> 21:20.400
a skillset I have. So I can, you know, we can do live switching. We can show screens. We can do

21:20.400 --> 21:25.200
that kind of stuff without impacting the content of the audio show. That's a lot of,

21:25.200 --> 21:29.760
that's a line that I learned a long time ago. You can mess up really easily. You can start

21:29.760 --> 21:33.760
referencing stuff. Oh, look at this, you know, and that kind of stuff. But we learned our lesson.

21:34.560 --> 21:39.520
You know, it's been, what, two years since the last PeerTube instance, JB PeerTube instance was

21:39.520 --> 21:45.840
up. I was curious if you've seen improvements since then, both in, I don't know, admin user

21:45.840 --> 21:52.000
interfaces and feature sets that are kind of tinkling your fancy, but also on the back end,

21:52.000 --> 21:56.160
are things a little easier or different or exciting in any way? Yeah, it was almost just

21:56.160 --> 22:00.000
about two years ago, and I think it was two versions of PeerTube ago. So some of the things

22:00.000 --> 22:06.080
that have been improved is the back end tooling to import videos, import bulk sets of videos.

22:06.080 --> 22:12.640
That was a big issue of mine. And then something that I did differently is this is a live,

22:12.640 --> 22:18.880
this is a live events and specials PeerTube instance. It's not a, every show gets published

22:18.880 --> 22:23.040
there, PeerTube instance. It's a lot easier to manage when you don't need like eight different

22:23.040 --> 22:27.040
accounts on this thing. When we deployed it this time, I was like, wow, this has gotten a lot

22:27.040 --> 22:32.800
better, both on the back end, on the front end. But you know, it could just use a couple of features

22:33.840 --> 22:39.680
and one of them, I'd really love to be able to edit a video because sometimes we start a stream,

22:39.680 --> 22:44.000
there's 20 minutes of music, no, not really 20, but there's 10, 15 minutes of music,

22:44.000 --> 22:48.320
and then the stream actually starts. Well, I could go, I could go lock that off. That'd be

22:48.320 --> 22:52.720
nice, right? If I could just go up into PeerTube and lock that off. And then the other feature

22:52.720 --> 22:58.560
that I really, after I deployed, I was like, God, I'd really like to have this is a permanent live

22:58.560 --> 23:06.080
URL that you can always go to. And then the videos available on demand later at a separate new URL

23:06.800 --> 23:12.560
and PeerTube offers one or the other. You can do a once live stream with a unique URL that's

23:12.560 --> 23:17.840
available later, which is what we're doing, or you can do a permanent live stream that isn't

23:17.840 --> 23:22.320
available later. It's like this URL, and it's just this is a live stream. It goes away after

23:22.320 --> 23:29.840
you stop streaming, but it's always at that URL. Well, today, as we record version 4.2 of PeerTube

23:29.840 --> 23:35.120
is out and they've added both those things. They've added live editing so you can go up to

23:35.120 --> 23:40.880
an uploaded video and you can set a new start time. You can set a new end time. You can even

23:40.880 --> 23:45.520
add an intro and outro to the video by uploading separate video files. You can even add a watermark

23:45.520 --> 23:52.160
to the video if you want. That's now in PeerTube, which is awesome. It sounds like you weren't the

23:52.160 --> 23:56.320
only one who wanted these features and just in time to I updated today and I actually don't

23:56.320 --> 23:58.800
see it in here. So I'm going to be playing around with that because I guess I have to,

23:58.800 --> 24:03.280
like, find the studio mode or something. But sometimes I want to get the stream up and going

24:03.840 --> 24:07.360
and I'm just putting around in here for like a half hour, getting the studio ready.

24:07.360 --> 24:11.120
It's not really anything that anybody like. It's like a lot to slog through when you go to

24:11.120 --> 24:15.120
playback. So I'm going to start probably trimming some of that off. Then they've added some new

24:15.120 --> 24:19.920
stats, which will be interesting to see. Now that we're doing this, it will actually be interesting

24:19.920 --> 24:26.160
to get data on how much of the live stuff people watch. And they have fixed the replay permanent

24:26.160 --> 24:31.600
link thing. So now they're telling me I can have a permanent URL that never changes. And I can also

24:31.600 --> 24:37.040
carve out unique URLs for playback later. With this sprint, they've really nailed everything

24:37.040 --> 24:42.800
I wanted in PeerTube. I think you'll have to come up with some new wishes and add it to their

24:42.800 --> 24:48.160
future requests because there's got to be more that you want. Come on. I would love our community,

24:48.160 --> 24:53.120
especially those that are interested, to dig into our PeerTube. I really would. I'd love you to go

24:53.120 --> 25:00.400
over there and dig into it and figure out ways to extract the videos, figure out ways to build

25:00.400 --> 25:08.160
playlists. And also, I would love to know if there's a way we could set up on-demand VPSs

25:08.160 --> 25:13.760
or maybe audience members could contribute some machine and we could set up web torrent seeds

25:13.760 --> 25:18.640
that could act as essentially a community CDN for live events. I think it'd be great.

25:18.640 --> 25:27.920
And yesterday I was streaming the WWDC 2022 event and it was rocking. PeerTube did so good. I was

25:28.480 --> 25:34.320
very impressed. I was very, very happy. But we had one viewer in Israel and he, I think,

25:34.320 --> 25:38.880
was the only viewer in Israel at the time. And as a result, he got some stuttering.

25:39.840 --> 25:46.640
And if we could spin up an instance in his area or if he could have an instance going in his area

25:46.640 --> 25:52.320
that when our PeerTube instance goes live, he participates in the web torrent in that area,

25:52.320 --> 25:56.800
then we could create a community CDN. And I think that'd be really powerful. So I'd love to have our

25:56.800 --> 26:02.400
community dig into it because PeerTube is an open platform and there's a lot we can build on top of

26:02.400 --> 26:07.520
this. And if we start building some momentum around that, I'm willing to commit resources to it. So

26:07.520 --> 26:11.760
we'll get all that going in the matrix room on the new JB PeerTube room that we'll set up.

26:12.400 --> 26:15.920
I think it should be pretty exciting. And I like where this is leading, man. You know,

26:15.920 --> 26:21.680
Green Bean boosted in. Boost! Seven days ago for a thousand sats. I've never run PeerTube,

26:21.680 --> 26:25.120
but I'd actually be quite interested in helping y'all put it to use. Stuff like this is super

26:25.120 --> 26:29.840
interesting. I just haven't had a use case for myself. If that resonates with you, like if you've

26:29.840 --> 26:32.880
wanted to play with some of this stuff, you've got some skill sets, but you just don't like

26:33.920 --> 26:39.280
have a particular use case, maybe you can work with us on this. So check for a link in the show

26:39.280 --> 26:43.280
notes on that and then stay tuned to Office Hours for future developments. We'll have the Cooking

26:43.280 --> 26:48.240
with Brent series up there soon. Right, Brent? Well, it's a work in progress, but you know,

26:48.240 --> 26:54.320
you might find it there. I will say, speaking of cooking, I know Wes was cooking quite a bit

26:54.320 --> 26:59.040
in talking about how he set up the PeerTube instance on the latest Linux Unplugged. I

26:59.040 --> 27:04.880
think that was 4.6.1. He dove into sort of how you guys use NixOS on the backend, and I thought

27:04.880 --> 27:07.840
that was a really great conversation. So if you're interested more in how that was built,

27:07.840 --> 27:12.080
I think that'd be a great place to go check it out. That is a good plug, indeed. All right,

27:12.080 --> 27:18.000
so while we're talking about podcasting 2.0, I have been trying out the various podcasting 2.0

27:18.000 --> 27:23.120
apps. Loved me some Fountain FM, and I recently tried out Podverse, which I like because it has

27:23.120 --> 27:28.720
iOS, Android, and a great web client. Really great web client. It has the value boosting built right

27:28.720 --> 27:33.360
in. It has some neat features like cross app comments, and it has that live stream support

27:33.360 --> 27:38.560
I was talking about. So I reached out to one of the co-founders. His name is Mitch,

27:38.560 --> 27:44.720
and I invited him on into the office. So Mitch, you and I just sat down. We started chatting,

27:45.520 --> 27:49.200
and I asked you if you were the creator of Podverse. I've been checking out the Podverse

27:49.200 --> 27:53.360
podcast app recently. One of the things I love about it, that's why I tried it out besides the

27:53.360 --> 27:59.280
fact that it's a podcasting 2.0 app, is because Podverse has a web client, which is fantastic,

27:59.280 --> 28:04.160
an Android client, and an iOS client. All the platforms, and they all sync up, and that got

28:04.160 --> 28:09.200
my attention. So I started asking you, are you the creator, the founder, the CEO? And you said,

28:09.200 --> 28:15.200
I'm a co-founder, and this has taken a ton more hours than we ever expected. So let's start there,

28:15.200 --> 28:20.720
because I thought I read somewhere that Podverse kind of started as a Clips tool, right? It was

28:20.720 --> 28:27.600
going to be for making podcast clips, not a full podcast app. Yeah, correct. So it's myself,

28:29.040 --> 28:35.040
Creon, and Gary. Creon is another developer with Podverse, and Gary does graphic design.

28:35.840 --> 28:42.560
And it originally was just supposed to be like a quick little project to get me started learning

28:42.560 --> 28:48.960
how to program. This was like eight years ago. I was a big fan of podcasts and wanted a way to

28:48.960 --> 28:53.600
share it with people. It was like a very isolated thing. It was something that was a big part of my

28:53.600 --> 28:58.880
life, but I didn't have an easy way to introduce other people to it. And eight years ago, there

28:58.880 --> 29:04.480
were not many options for sharing clips. So I went down this journey of learning how to

29:05.680 --> 29:11.760
write code and create apps. So it's turned into something much bigger than that. Now it's not

29:11.760 --> 29:17.680
just a clip sharing app. We try to do every feature we could possibly want. That's one of

29:17.680 --> 29:23.760
the things, though. For a good clip sharing app, it needs to be my primary podcast app. I don't

29:23.760 --> 29:29.680
want to be bouncing in and out of the app. So it ended up kind of just naturally becoming something

29:29.680 --> 29:33.440
much bigger than that. I hadn't thought of that. Of course, that would sort of be a natural

29:33.440 --> 29:38.640
evolution of it. It makes total sense. And then I suppose the podcasting 2.0 stuff kind of came

29:38.640 --> 29:43.200
around just at the right time for an app at this size and this stage. Tell me a little bit about

29:43.200 --> 29:51.760
that. Yeah, so that started about a year and a half ago. I think it was like September 2000.

29:52.560 --> 29:57.680
Boy, I don't even remember years anymore. The before times? Yeah, the before times. It's all

29:57.680 --> 30:03.200
blur with all the COVID stuff. I was just actually looking in the community to try to

30:03.200 --> 30:08.720
branch out and find some open source collaborations. And I sent an email to

30:08.720 --> 30:14.640
James Cridland of Podnews. And he sent me an email back saying, hey, there's this new thing

30:14.640 --> 30:20.480
called Podcasting 2.0. Here's a sneak peek. He sent me the first episode before it was released.

30:21.120 --> 30:25.600
And I listened to it. I was like, oh, man, this is exactly what we're looking for because we're

30:25.600 --> 30:31.680
an open source app. We're like principles first in that respect. And we just want what is best

30:31.680 --> 30:39.520
for podcasting. Podcasting 2.0, it's two things in particular. It is the world's largest podcast

30:39.520 --> 30:44.720
database. It's managed by Dave Jones and Adam Curry. Adam Curry, also known as the Podfather,

30:45.840 --> 30:55.280
one of the original creators of podcasting. And it's also extending the RSS spec, which all

30:55.280 --> 31:03.680
podcasts use, so that new features are possible in podcast apps. And this is really exciting if

31:03.680 --> 31:09.280
you are familiar with the podcast industry because RSS has not evolved much at all,

31:10.080 --> 31:17.280
what, like 10, 15 years. And now that this group has come along and there's apps like ourselves and

31:17.280 --> 31:23.600
RSS hosts participating in this, we're finally getting some consensus and people agreeing on

31:23.600 --> 31:31.600
what features we can add and how we can add it to RSS feeds. For almost 20 years, people struggled

31:31.600 --> 31:37.200
to get agreement, to get enough consensus to actually adopt these new practices.

31:37.200 --> 31:42.160
And it seems like it just sort of was a great timing of things where the application development

31:42.160 --> 31:48.240
process was at, where the podcasting 2.0 community was at. And correct me if I'm wrong, but really

31:48.240 --> 31:54.720
before the podcasting 2.0 spec, you had maybe Apple would create some random tags for their own

31:54.720 --> 31:59.200
internal use, and then you'd have app developers just kind of begin baking in support for those

31:59.200 --> 32:03.600
tags that Apple had just added. There wasn't any standards that had been announced or discussed or

32:03.600 --> 32:09.760
debated. It just, where Apple led, people had to follow. Yeah, it was pretty much Apple and

32:09.760 --> 32:14.640
set all the norms and the industry just followed from there. Before Podcast Index came along,

32:14.640 --> 32:21.120
we had 50,000 podcasts in our database. Now we have over 5 million in our database.

32:21.120 --> 32:28.480
They do so much heavy lifting for us. We do a continuous syncing operation with their database.

32:28.480 --> 32:36.320
And that work of just parsing 5 million podcasts, that's a full-time job for multiple people

32:36.320 --> 32:43.200
in itself. And we get to leverage that for free because it's an open platform.

32:43.200 --> 32:47.600
Do you take advantage of Podping to update the clients of new releases? Are you doing it through

32:47.600 --> 32:49.680
traditional RSS fetching? How does that work?

32:49.680 --> 32:55.440
So we sync with Podcast Index through API endpoints. We don't use Podping directly,

32:55.440 --> 33:02.320
except for with the new live stream feature where we do listen to Podping directly. There may come

33:02.320 --> 33:08.560
a day where we are listening for all of our updates just from Podping, but for now, if we listen to

33:08.560 --> 33:13.760
the Podcast Index API, we get more than just Podping updates. A lot of feeds still are not

33:14.400 --> 33:20.720
on Podping yet, so we get all of the updates that Podcast Index discovers. But yeah, like I said,

33:20.720 --> 33:26.960
we do listen for live stream updates through Podping, and it is a tremendous innovation

33:27.440 --> 33:31.920
because it allows you to send all kinds of real-time notifications to podcast apps.

33:31.920 --> 33:35.280
Yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing just more and more apps adopt that over time. I'm sure

33:35.280 --> 33:40.080
there'll be things to work out, but so I've kind of been, you know, sampling different podcasting

33:40.080 --> 33:46.160
2.0 apps recently, and it's made me appreciate just how freaking hard it is to actually build

33:46.160 --> 33:49.040
a podcast app. And I think a lot of people, when they look at a podcast app, they think,

33:49.840 --> 33:55.040
how hard could it be? It's RSS feeds. It goes and gets files from the RSS feed, and then it plays

33:55.040 --> 34:00.880
it using a built-in API. Like, how hard is that? But what I've discovered chatting with Oscar from

34:00.880 --> 34:05.120
Fountain and just kind of using these different apps is that this is actually a really hard problem

34:05.120 --> 34:10.560
to solve. And I'm curious, what are some of the biggest challenges that you guys run into? Is it

34:10.560 --> 34:15.600
like user expectation stuff? Is it like code stuff? What are the big challenges on creating Podverse

34:15.600 --> 34:22.000
maybe you didn't expect? Biggest challenges are typically just because the content is all hosted

34:22.000 --> 34:28.880
by the podcasters themselves. And if you were to go through a platform, let's say like YouTube,

34:28.880 --> 34:33.200
which is totally centralized, they control how everything goes into it and how everything goes

34:33.200 --> 34:39.920
out of it. It's much easier to know what to expect as a programmer and how to code for those

34:39.920 --> 34:46.880
situations. But with podcasting, there's some self-hosting involved. And so there's different

34:46.880 --> 34:52.400
file types that might not work, handling all the different conditions that you end up running into

34:52.400 --> 35:00.320
over five million podcast feeds in the world. Another problem for us is dynamic ads, because

35:00.320 --> 35:07.360
we are a clip sharing, like that's one of our primary features is clip sharing. And dynamic ads

35:07.360 --> 35:14.960
will screw up the timestamps. So if I say, here's a clip from three minutes to five minutes in this

35:14.960 --> 35:20.960
show, and it's just a reference point, and then we send that in a link to somebody, if they're

35:20.960 --> 35:26.160
dynamic ads, it might jump to 30 seconds ahead or behind. Of course. Right. So how do you solve

35:26.160 --> 35:32.560
for that even? Can you solve for that? For now, we just don't. Dynamic ads are just not our favorite

35:32.560 --> 35:39.520
thing. And to be honest, for some podcasts, it works great if they don't have dynamic ads. If

35:39.520 --> 35:46.800
they do, you still get an approximation of the clip. We're open to solving it in better ways,

35:46.800 --> 35:53.920
but we really don't ever get complaints about it. It seems like people just, most shows don't use

35:53.920 --> 36:04.080
dynamic ads. And that's such a big problem to solve. And we would have to do our own detection

36:04.800 --> 36:11.440
and we'd have to figure out other people's rules that they could change on a whim. We would need a

36:11.440 --> 36:19.120
standard that we can follow reliably. Yeah, really would. You would have hoped, just a crazy idea,

36:19.120 --> 36:23.280
but you would have hoped a standard like that would have been created before dynamic ads started

36:23.280 --> 36:27.280
rolling out. But this is the result of nothing really evolving in the podcast industry for the

36:27.280 --> 36:33.840
last 15 plus years. So on the topic of funding, I'd really like to pick your brain as a developer

36:33.840 --> 36:38.960
and as somebody who's implementing this stuff, what are your thoughts on the boostagrams,

36:38.960 --> 36:43.440
value for value, and building an application on top of the lightning network? How has that whole

36:43.440 --> 36:48.560
thing gone? Value for value is very exciting. This is one of those developments that I didn't see

36:48.560 --> 36:53.680
coming with all the eight years of working on this app until podcasting 2.0 came along.

36:54.480 --> 37:02.640
Yes, so it's the ability to send value. In our case, it's Bitcoin directly to the podcaster,

37:02.640 --> 37:08.800
content creator, as you're listening. So we've been out of this for a long time until recently.

37:08.800 --> 37:13.040
There's been other podcasting 2.0 apps doing this, and we only recently were able to get

37:13.040 --> 37:20.880
involved with it through the Albee extension. It's very exciting to be able to support creators

37:20.880 --> 37:29.520
directly without having to go through middlemen. And yet Albee allows us a way where we, as an app,

37:29.520 --> 37:35.280
don't have to be custodians of people's wallets, which was a big sticking point for us, that we

37:35.280 --> 37:41.360
want to be able to facilitate these payments, donations basically, or boosts as we call them,

37:41.360 --> 37:45.280
but we don't want to control people's wallets at the end of the day. We don't want to be stewards

37:45.280 --> 37:50.240
of it. That's just so far outside of scope of what we're trying to do as a podcast app.

37:50.240 --> 37:54.720
Yeah, I could totally understand that. So if I'm using Podverse to boost a podcast,

37:54.720 --> 37:58.800
does Podverse get a split in there to help sustain development? Have you guys talked about doing

37:58.800 --> 38:04.480
something like that? So currently, it's voluntary. We do offer the ability to send us a split. So

38:05.040 --> 38:11.200
on the website, if you are on a value-enabled podcast, which there's over 6,000 value-enabled

38:11.200 --> 38:16.320
podcasts currently. Including our own podcasts. Including your own. And the wonderful podcasting

38:16.320 --> 38:21.680
2.0 pod. It's actually an open source library that anybody can add to a website if they want.

38:21.680 --> 38:29.040
It's a web component. You just load a script through a CDN, and then you put a web component

38:29.040 --> 38:34.880
on the page. Which, if people are familiar with HTML, it's just a very simple element that you

38:34.880 --> 38:42.960
put on the page. And then it generates this form, which then calls webln methods. There's a new

38:42.960 --> 38:50.400
standard called webln, and it allows browsers to interact with browser extensions. So you can

38:50.400 --> 38:58.720
have browser extensions, is how I think of it. So ALBEE is webln compatible, and that form is

38:58.720 --> 39:06.080
webln compatible. So if you have ALBEE installed on your browser, then that form will be enabled.

39:06.080 --> 39:11.200
It'll be able to send messages to the ALBEE extension, and then ALBEE goes ahead and sends

39:11.200 --> 39:16.960
Bitcoin to the creators. Fascinating. I've been wondering about ALBEE. It looked like maybe

39:16.960 --> 39:20.560
I'd want to check out. I actually installed the extension, but I haven't set it up yet. I really

39:20.560 --> 39:25.120
like the idea of having it on a web form. Some people just love their existing podcast app.

39:25.120 --> 39:28.240
They don't want to switch. That must be something you guys are constantly thinking about, too.

39:29.120 --> 39:34.080
Some people. Not everybody. Some people are still using the default podcast app.

39:34.960 --> 39:39.920
Some people have made a real conscious decision to switch apps. What are your thoughts on getting

39:39.920 --> 39:45.280
people to entice them to try out Podverse? It's a really difficult problem, and I think

39:45.280 --> 39:51.280
I'm really bad at marketing, so I don't have a great answer. You understand how people get

39:51.280 --> 39:56.880
entrenched in whatever habits, whatever platform you're using. It has to take something really

39:56.880 --> 40:02.800
compelling to pull you into a new app. I don't really have a solution other than that. We just

40:02.800 --> 40:07.680
keep trying to add exciting features, try to do things in what we think is the right way,

40:07.680 --> 40:13.600
where we're all free and open source software. We don't sell people's information. We don't spam

40:13.600 --> 40:18.400
people. We don't add our own advertisements and stuff like that. We're just trying to make the

40:18.400 --> 40:25.440
best product we can, and hopefully word of mouth will take hold. That kind of raises something I've

40:25.440 --> 40:32.960
been thinking a lot about lately, though, which is how it would be nice if our apps could share

40:32.960 --> 40:38.720
data between themselves in compatible ways to make it easier for people to switch between apps.

40:38.720 --> 40:42.960
Not just in, like, I'm going from app A and now app B is my new app, but that you could bounce

40:42.960 --> 40:54.480
between the two. It's conceivable if we have export-import standards between apps, but to my

40:54.480 --> 41:00.800
knowledge, I'm not aware of existing standards for that. So that is something I'd like to explore.

41:00.800 --> 41:03.600
You have support for OPML imports now, right?

41:03.600 --> 41:06.480
Yes. OPML is good for your podcast...

41:06.480 --> 41:07.520
Manual.

41:07.520 --> 41:10.560
...manual. Well, it's your podcast subscriptions,

41:10.560 --> 41:15.520
but what about your listening history? Like, since we're syncing across devices,

41:16.080 --> 41:21.680
a lot of people actually like the mark as played feature. Like, we get emails about it saying,

41:22.400 --> 41:26.480
you know, if it's not working, they'll tell us, like, hey, I want to see which ones I've listened

41:26.480 --> 41:30.320
to already. That was a big draw for me for Podverse. You know, I'm listening in the car

41:31.040 --> 41:34.880
and then I get back to get down to the studio. I want to finish it up on my studio speakers.

41:34.880 --> 41:39.840
I like to play it on my desktop, so syncing between them is... That's got to be an interesting

41:39.840 --> 41:45.600
challenge. I was curious, too, what your thoughts are on cross-app comments. I see a couple of

41:45.600 --> 41:50.560
different trajectories in the podcasting 2.0 community right now. Some podcast apps are already

41:50.560 --> 41:55.680
just going all in with the lightning comments. What are your thoughts on cross-podcast app

41:55.680 --> 41:59.280
comments? So maybe I'm on Podverse and I leave a comment and somebody's on Fountain,

41:59.280 --> 42:03.520
they leave a comment. In theory, no matter what app you're on, you'd be able to read those comments.

42:03.520 --> 42:10.240
Yeah, well, so at least one version of it is very doable, which we've already implemented on

42:10.240 --> 42:16.480
web and mobile. So yeah, the idea is a unifying thread, like the podcaster has one thread in

42:16.480 --> 42:22.960
particular they want all of the apps to use, which is a brilliant idea and very useful, I think,

42:23.600 --> 42:26.880
rather than being scattered across 10 different comment threads.

42:26.880 --> 42:27.600
Amen to that.

42:27.600 --> 42:34.880
The part that I'm not sure how we accomplish is sending comments through the app. So currently,

42:34.880 --> 42:42.240
the way we have it set up is it'll render the comments, but if you want to leave a comment,

42:42.240 --> 42:48.560
you have to press it and it'll open the web page that is where it actually is hosting the comment.

42:48.560 --> 42:51.600
And I see it's doing a little bit of thinking as it collects them, too.

42:51.600 --> 42:54.720
I get nervous when a loading spinner takes more than three seconds.

42:54.720 --> 42:59.600
Hey, but it was because there's a big picture in there. That's why

43:00.160 --> 43:02.960
somebody loaded up a big picture in their comment. I didn't even know you could do that.

43:03.520 --> 43:07.280
Yeah, so this is Activity Pub, which is like a federated,

43:08.560 --> 43:11.840
I would compare it to Twitter and people's common experience.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.760
Sort of like Mastodon's back end, right?

43:13.760 --> 43:14.240
Yes.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.800
I'm vaguely familiar with it because I know PeerTube uses that as well.

43:17.360 --> 43:22.960
So there's like a root comment and we just collect all the comments based on that and then

43:22.960 --> 43:27.360
we render them in there. And if you were to click on it, it would open that Mastodon instance and

43:27.360 --> 43:33.920
you could then leave comments through that page. So we have that set up with Activity Pub and also

43:33.920 --> 43:34.800
Twitter.

43:34.800 --> 43:39.120
And then, of course, the Fountain App's been experimenting with lightning comments, which

43:39.840 --> 43:43.200
I think I think Activity Pub makes more sense to me just from a technical standpoint.

43:43.200 --> 43:46.080
But I'd be curious to pick your brain on what you think about lightning comments.

43:46.640 --> 43:50.240
It doesn't really fit with what we're trying to do.

43:50.240 --> 43:55.920
I don't we haven't thought about it very much. I don't see the value added.

43:55.920 --> 44:01.760
If there's more demand from listeners and podcasters, it's something we could explore more.

44:01.760 --> 44:07.680
But we're not really like a crypto first app or a podcasting first app.

44:07.680 --> 44:13.840
It just so happens that it's getting really easy to add these value enabled features.

44:13.840 --> 44:18.080
And it's an exciting thing to participate in. So we're going down that road.

44:18.080 --> 44:20.560
I like it. I'm glad you I think that's a good balance to strike.

44:20.560 --> 44:25.440
And I think Bitcoin and lightning is the safer of any of the cryptos to enable.

44:25.440 --> 44:30.800
So I think that was a you know, it's a nice, I'd say, cautious move that is really I mean,

44:31.520 --> 44:33.760
the boost I get, I love them, man. I love them.

44:33.760 --> 44:38.960
They're the I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had an interaction with the audience

44:38.960 --> 44:39.840
like I get with the boost.

44:39.840 --> 44:44.560
And then the other thing that's really neat and you may have noticed this as well is I noticed

44:44.560 --> 44:49.040
a bit of a community growing in podcasting today. I'll hear some of the same folks boost other shows

44:49.040 --> 44:53.360
and then, you know, I kind of get to know people through them boosting other shows and stuff.

44:53.360 --> 44:54.880
It's been really, really neat.

44:54.880 --> 44:58.080
What I love about what you guys what you guys are doing is you've touched on a couple of times.

44:58.080 --> 44:59.440
It's free software.

44:59.440 --> 45:02.080
Could we just expand on that just a little bit to kind of wrap this up?

45:02.080 --> 45:04.240
Why free software? What's the licensing?

45:04.240 --> 45:08.960
And are you ever going to make money at doing this if it's if it's all free software?

45:08.960 --> 45:11.120
Yeah, well, hopefully, hopefully.

45:11.120 --> 45:15.680
Partly, I just love open source software and it's like motivated me to learn software.

45:15.680 --> 45:20.000
It's hard to maybe explain, but just ever since I was a kid growing up in the 90s,

45:20.000 --> 45:24.480
I just thought it was amazing that you could create something for free and give it away

45:25.120 --> 45:26.560
all across the world instantly.

45:26.560 --> 45:29.040
It's just like one of the coolest concepts.

45:29.040 --> 45:29.520
I get it.

45:30.160 --> 45:33.200
Obviously, you do. Linux unplugged. You get it.

45:33.760 --> 45:40.720
Also, it's just we're trying to make software we really want to use and something that gets

45:40.720 --> 45:44.240
in the way of what we want to use is advertisements and tracking.

45:45.120 --> 45:51.840
And the perfect app in my mind wouldn't be closed software because what are we trying

45:51.840 --> 45:53.200
to accomplish with that?

45:53.200 --> 45:54.800
Just make money, I assume.

45:54.800 --> 45:58.400
Like so open source allows us to be transparent.

45:58.400 --> 46:01.680
People know exactly how our code works if they want to inspect it.

46:01.680 --> 46:03.440
So we have nothing to hide.

46:04.160 --> 46:09.040
And also, people can make it better if people don't like how we're managing our platform.

46:09.040 --> 46:14.080
If we make some sort of decision to remove content, for example, and people are unhappy

46:14.080 --> 46:18.720
with it, they have access to all the tools we have to start their own instance with it.

46:18.720 --> 46:22.400
I think it fits with the spirit of podcasting too.

46:22.400 --> 46:27.360
Podcasting is a mostly open platform in itself.

46:28.480 --> 46:31.040
So yeah, that's the primary.

46:31.040 --> 46:34.480
I just I love open source software and it excites me.

46:34.480 --> 46:39.760
And there's also not that many great open source podcast apps.

46:39.760 --> 46:45.200
There are many open, but they're kind of like hobbies or like a side project, like a weekend

46:45.200 --> 46:48.880
thing somebody did for a couple months before this.

46:48.880 --> 46:53.360
The only one I was really aware of is AntennaPod, which is Android only and it's a great app.

46:54.240 --> 46:55.200
But Android only.

46:55.920 --> 47:00.960
I'm not even sure what the leading iOS open source app would be.

47:01.760 --> 47:02.480
Probably Podverse.

47:02.480 --> 47:05.120
Maybe, maybe now I hope.

47:05.120 --> 47:05.680
I mean, I love it.

47:05.680 --> 47:09.920
You know, the only thing if I could if I as a podcaster could have anything I wanted from

47:09.920 --> 47:14.560
Podverse, I know it's going to be really crazy, but I'd love to be able to embed your player

47:14.560 --> 47:19.360
on my website so that it's a basic player on my website with all the play controls that

47:19.360 --> 47:23.600
you guys have and the artwork display and the description display that it could expand.

47:23.600 --> 47:26.640
And then if they wanted to click into it, they just go into Podverse and be in the whole

47:26.640 --> 47:28.400
Podverse experience or something like that.

47:28.400 --> 47:31.520
But something I could embed on my page because we're looking at rebuilding our website.

47:31.520 --> 47:36.480
And we're looking at what we want to use as our podcast playback when people just want

47:36.480 --> 47:37.440
to listen on the website.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.680
None of them are as good as Podverse's, you know.

47:40.400 --> 47:41.120
Wow, well, thank you.

47:41.760 --> 47:42.000
Thanks.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.720
It's funny you say that because it's like one of my top items on my whiteboard is embed.

47:46.720 --> 47:47.200
Oh, really?

47:48.400 --> 47:50.320
Embedding is coming soon.

47:50.320 --> 47:51.280
Well, let me know.

47:51.280 --> 47:51.760
Let me know.

47:52.320 --> 47:55.360
Yeah, we saw guys who have been promoting us a lot.

47:55.360 --> 47:57.600
They're doing they're just been really nice.

47:57.600 --> 47:58.800
The sleek podcast.

47:58.800 --> 48:03.360
They ended up embedding our whole web page in an iFrame on their site.

48:03.360 --> 48:04.800
It's like, OK, go ahead.

48:04.800 --> 48:05.840
That's one way I suppose.

48:06.880 --> 48:08.720
I'm looking for something a little more low key.

48:08.720 --> 48:11.520
No, no, we'll have a proper clean design for it.

48:11.520 --> 48:14.080
Well, Mitch, thank you, sir, for coming on here and chatting with me.

48:14.080 --> 48:16.800
I'll have a link to Podverse.fm if people want to check it out.

48:16.800 --> 48:19.600
Of course, Office Hours is in there and I can link to Office Hours.

48:19.600 --> 48:20.400
So I'll do that.

48:20.400 --> 48:21.440
That'll be in Podverse.

48:22.800 --> 48:26.160
I mean, what else do we anything we didn't touch on that you'd like to mention or anything

48:26.160 --> 48:29.760
about support or anything like that, just to let you know anything kind of open ended

48:29.760 --> 48:32.320
for you to touch on before we wrap up?

48:32.320 --> 48:32.800
Not really.

48:32.800 --> 48:37.040
Just if anybody has any questions or feedback, Podverse.fm.

48:37.040 --> 48:40.640
We have multiple contact options through there.

48:40.640 --> 48:44.560
Also, if anybody is interested in helping with translations, we have a translations

48:44.560 --> 48:50.480
community and we're trying to we have this nice setup that makes it really easy for people

48:50.480 --> 48:55.440
just pop in and start translating words and you don't have to translate everything just

48:55.440 --> 48:59.280
like here and there if you translate some words and then it ends up automatically getting

48:59.920 --> 49:02.800
making a PR that goes to our repo.

49:02.800 --> 49:03.760
It's called Web Blade.

49:03.760 --> 49:05.920
I'm not sure if you've ever heard of it before.

49:06.720 --> 49:07.440
I'll have to look into that.

49:07.440 --> 49:08.640
That sounds really great.

49:08.640 --> 49:09.520
It's really cool.

49:09.520 --> 49:11.200
That actually makes it possible, huh?

49:11.200 --> 49:12.320
That's so cool.

49:12.320 --> 49:15.440
Also, I should mention Podverse is probably in your local app store.

49:15.440 --> 49:16.720
You know, go find it there.

49:16.720 --> 49:18.720
App Store, Android and F-droid.

49:19.360 --> 49:22.080
Hey, F-droid, good man.

49:22.080 --> 49:23.200
I love to see that.

49:23.200 --> 49:24.080
Very good.

49:24.080 --> 49:25.360
I will keep up the good work.

49:25.360 --> 49:25.520
All right.

49:25.520 --> 49:26.000
Thanks, man.

49:34.480 --> 49:38.720
A special thank you to Mitch for joining us, spending a little bit extra time coming into

49:38.720 --> 49:43.040
the office and hanging out and the hard work he and his co-founder are doing on Podverse.

49:43.760 --> 49:49.600
We'll have links to Podverse's main page, office hours in there and also their GitHub

49:49.600 --> 49:50.880
because it is all open source.

49:51.520 --> 49:53.360
So we'll have all that there.

49:53.360 --> 49:55.920
Hey, Brent, little breaking news here in the studio.

49:55.920 --> 49:56.400
Really?

49:56.400 --> 49:59.600
While we were, yeah, while we were watching that, I got a knock on the door.

49:59.600 --> 50:00.480
And who was it?

50:00.480 --> 50:01.360
That's kind of random.

50:02.640 --> 50:08.880
I mean, you know, I did not expect this, but it was FedEx and they were arriving with my

50:08.880 --> 50:12.960
review unit for the HP Dev1 laptop.

50:12.960 --> 50:14.240
That is impressive.

50:14.240 --> 50:18.800
Well, I know it's just a white box at this point, but geez, I kind of feel like this might

50:18.800 --> 50:22.560
turn into like a box opening video all of a sudden.

50:22.560 --> 50:26.480
Oh, and I got there's a little note in here.

50:26.480 --> 50:28.080
There's a little note in here.

50:28.080 --> 50:31.040
It says, thank you for taking the time to check out our Dev1 notebook.

50:31.040 --> 50:32.480
Hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

50:32.480 --> 50:34.640
Looking forward to hearing what you think about it.

50:35.280 --> 50:39.120
Best, HP Dev1 and System76.

50:39.120 --> 50:39.760
That's awesome.

50:42.320 --> 50:46.320
So I'm curious what you're planning on putting this thing through.

50:46.320 --> 50:47.680
Have you thought about that at all?

50:47.680 --> 50:53.200
Oh, you know, a battery of tests just to kind of get an idea of what the heat and fan noise

50:53.200 --> 50:54.000
is like.

50:54.000 --> 50:55.840
And then a lot of just functionality tests.

50:56.480 --> 51:00.400
So my buddy Mike on Coda Radio has had his he actually bought one.

51:00.400 --> 51:01.840
So he's had it for a few days longer.

51:01.840 --> 51:06.000
And he did his his first impressions on Coda Radio, which came out on Wednesday.

51:06.640 --> 51:11.360
And we talk about after we talk about WWDC, we talk about his HP Dev1.

51:12.080 --> 51:15.280
So I'll probably give some first impressions and Linux unplugged this week, I would imagine.

51:15.280 --> 51:18.960
I would like to know, are you going to run just whatever came on it?

51:18.960 --> 51:20.480
Are you going to replace it as well?

51:21.200 --> 51:22.640
Any thoughts around that?

51:22.640 --> 51:27.120
You know, I feel like I should always run it in the default config for a period of time

51:27.120 --> 51:28.720
and get a sense of the product.

51:29.520 --> 51:33.280
And so a lot of times if it's something like this, because this is unique, right?

51:33.280 --> 51:35.760
This is Pop OS on the Dev1.

51:35.760 --> 51:37.760
This is Pop OS on HP hardware.

51:38.320 --> 51:39.040
This is a little different.

51:39.040 --> 51:43.920
So I feel like in that case, I am probably going to try to optimize the bulk of my review

51:43.920 --> 51:49.760
for Pop OS, but I imagine in the last couple of days, I'll probably throw Fedora on there,

51:49.760 --> 51:54.480
maybe NixOS on there, you know, that kind of stuff, because it's all AMD in here, right?

51:54.480 --> 51:58.720
And my question is, is how much simpler does that make just trying out different distros?

51:58.720 --> 52:01.040
Because I suspect it makes it much simpler.

52:01.040 --> 52:03.680
OK, well, I'll look forward to your review.

52:03.680 --> 52:06.160
Also, the pricing, it's about a grand.

52:06.720 --> 52:11.600
It's not unreasonable if this is a well-built, long lasting, well-performing Linux laptop

52:11.600 --> 52:14.400
that doesn't make too much fan noise when it's under load.

52:14.400 --> 52:18.320
I could see this kind of being like, you know, when JB gets to the point where we're kitting

52:18.320 --> 52:22.960
out remote hosts like yourself, this would be like the recording laptop you would get.

52:24.240 --> 52:28.640
Because this would be so much better for you because it's so much newer and it's got GPU

52:28.640 --> 52:33.280
acceleration that would take care of things like visualizing the audio bars that are probably

52:33.280 --> 52:35.760
being rendered by CPU right now and that kind of stuff.

52:35.760 --> 52:39.440
So I'm going to try it out, let you know, it literally just came along with this in

52:39.440 --> 52:41.760
here. It wasn't in the show notes. I was kind of confused.

52:42.560 --> 52:46.560
No, no, I'm just just throwing it at you because I had a little knock knock.

52:46.560 --> 52:51.040
I got a message from Mike from Koda Radio that his review unit just showed up.

52:51.040 --> 52:54.000
So I thought, oh, I'll go check to see if, you know, everybody's getting there.

52:54.000 --> 52:56.240
So I'm sure everybody who's getting one just got theirs.

52:56.800 --> 53:05.360
And also in the box came with the System 76 launch keyboard and this HP 935 creator wireless

53:05.360 --> 53:09.920
mouse that they seem to be really jazzed about. So that came in the box as well.

53:10.960 --> 53:13.120
That can either deck in the reviewers out, I suppose.

53:13.120 --> 53:15.520
I think it's just one standard config for this.

53:16.960 --> 53:19.840
Like when you buy it, if you go to buy it, it's just one config.

53:19.840 --> 53:24.000
There's no customizing. But then I guess the RAM is removable.

53:24.000 --> 53:28.240
Supposedly that might be something. I don't recognize those screw types, though.

53:28.240 --> 53:33.760
Oh, that's never a good. I don't know how I don't know how upgradeable it is.

53:33.760 --> 53:39.680
You have to call your machinist friend to come design some screwdrivers for you.

53:39.680 --> 53:41.200
Yeah. Is that you?

53:42.000 --> 53:43.440
It could be. Yes, it could be.

53:44.800 --> 53:46.800
Is that Alex? Who's my machinist friend?

53:46.800 --> 53:48.560
Anyone local? We need someone.

53:49.280 --> 53:51.280
I need to know this guy. This is important.

53:51.280 --> 53:52.560
Well, that's very exciting.

53:53.520 --> 53:55.520
Let's do a few boosts there, Mr. Brent.

53:55.520 --> 53:58.080
Yeah, we got some great boosts. I recognize some names. You know,

53:58.080 --> 54:02.080
they're starting to get very familiar here. Marcel wrote in seven days ago with

54:02.080 --> 54:06.400
thirty thirty sats, which I feel like there's a bunch of subliminal messages in those.

54:06.400 --> 54:07.760
Thirty thirty, huh?

54:07.760 --> 54:12.480
I see some down the line with equally obscure numbers, but who knows?

54:12.480 --> 54:16.640
Boy, this one's this one. I usually have a guess. This one has me stumped.

54:16.640 --> 54:19.520
Marcel will have to reveal because I have no guess.

54:19.520 --> 54:24.480
Yes, please let us know. So Marcel writes, I know you all know this,

54:24.480 --> 54:27.360
but injected ads into podcasts are the worst.

54:27.360 --> 54:31.760
They're jarring and 90 percent of the time something I would never, ever be interested in.

54:32.320 --> 54:36.480
I've stopped listening to podcasts because of it. I know podcasters need to eat,

54:36.480 --> 54:43.680
which is why I boost and support Jupiter.Party. I also support lame podcasting 1.0 shows on Patreon.

54:44.240 --> 54:49.440
I like how the J.B. ads are recorded by you and how they're different every time.

54:49.440 --> 54:54.240
I signed up for Linode for that exact reason. Thanks for not doing injected ads.

54:54.240 --> 55:00.480
Yeah, I've always felt like that's part of the value of our reads is that we do them

55:00.480 --> 55:06.720
and we get like hands on with the product. I can't say I would never, ever, ever consider

55:07.760 --> 55:14.400
dynamic ads because I heard from the podcasting 2.0 pod that I think it was pod being has

55:14.400 --> 55:20.240
supposedly created, supposedly created this system that transcribes the podcast.

55:20.240 --> 55:24.720
Then it uses some magic A.I. to figure out a natural beat to put a cut.

55:25.280 --> 55:30.720
And then when it puts a cut in there, it underplays a little bit of a jingle

55:30.720 --> 55:34.400
as the as the host was finishing their sentence, a little bit of a jingle

55:34.400 --> 55:38.480
into the ad start, then the ad plays and then a little bit of a jingle back.

55:38.480 --> 55:42.640
And it resumes where the podcaster was continuing to speak with all with the music fading out.

55:42.640 --> 55:49.120
And then on top of that, supposedly it'll even auto update the chapters and split them into

55:49.120 --> 55:52.400
part one and part two so it doesn't mess with the chapter markers and stuff like that.

55:53.120 --> 55:58.400
I don't like it. I'll just be honest with you. The value, I think, is in the back catalog,

55:58.400 --> 56:03.280
perhaps for some podcasters. So imagine a little behind the scenes here, Marcel.

56:04.400 --> 56:08.640
It's like we do these shows and some of these shows continued to get downloaded

56:09.840 --> 56:14.720
for a decade almost. If somebody were to go listen to an old episode of Linux action show,

56:14.720 --> 56:21.600
they'd hear an ad for GoDaddy in there right now. Would it make sense to slice that out

56:22.080 --> 56:26.240
and instead put a, you know, a current sponsor in there if it was a difference between

56:26.800 --> 56:31.600
the podcaster, you know, making or breaking it? Maybe I don't know, but I think it has to be done

56:31.600 --> 56:35.920
right. Maybe the folks at Podbean are starting to figure it out. The tech still new and people just

56:35.920 --> 56:40.880
rushed to it because it was, in my opinion, an easy way to make money on your back catalog.

56:40.880 --> 56:48.480
So True Grit's boosted in seven days ago with 3409 stats, which I think that's a Tesla thing.

56:48.480 --> 56:50.960
I don't get the reference, but someone will fill us in.

56:50.960 --> 56:54.400
Says you mentioned on a live stream once that you were testing out PeerTube

56:55.520 --> 56:59.440
and that tended to be generally behind, say, maybe Twitch or YouTube because of the peer

56:59.440 --> 57:03.680
to peer streaming nature. What if the live streams were actually streamed to PeerTube first

57:03.680 --> 57:08.720
and then sent out to YouTube and Twitch after that? Would that solve the problem or would it

57:08.720 --> 57:13.920
just make it worse? That's a great question. Very on point true grits with today's episode, too.

57:14.480 --> 57:22.160
We are considering that, but probably not. I'll probably keep going to Twitch and YouTube until

57:22.160 --> 57:27.760
they stop giving me free bandwidth, which I assume is inevitable. My my dread and I know this just

57:27.760 --> 57:34.800
sounds like conspiracy bacon right now, but my dread is that some Western government is going to

57:34.800 --> 57:41.200
outlaw encryption in some way and that it's going to create a horrible conflict in the free software

57:41.200 --> 57:46.640
community. And I'm going to fall on the side that encryption should be available to everyone,

57:47.520 --> 57:53.440
that it's a human right. And so I, you know, I could see a day and age without me doing anything

57:53.440 --> 57:58.320
politically controversial, without me like, you know, becoming like the Alex Jones of podcasting.

57:58.320 --> 58:05.440
I could see the current status quo shifting to where maybe, you know, my stuff is labeled as

58:05.440 --> 58:10.000
dangerous or misinformation or something like that, because I'm not, you know, I don't know.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.800
I mean, I'm just thinking what could happen. I'm also thinking what if one day I wanted to

58:12.800 --> 58:16.800
get down the road and not have a Google account, that kind of stuff. That's just been on my mind,

58:16.800 --> 58:21.280
you know, but so I think about until they kick me off, we might as well take the free bandwidth and

58:21.280 --> 58:25.600
get the free network effect. And then what we'll do is we'll just do more stuff on the

58:25.600 --> 58:29.280
peer tube over time. We'll stream earlier over there where we can play whatever we want without

58:29.280 --> 58:33.680
getting, you know, kicked off like the WWDC stream or some special event or like, you know,

58:33.680 --> 58:43.920
cooking with Brent and true grits actually sent in a double boost. They're going to say that

58:44.560 --> 58:50.320
they're still waiting on the membership feed to support boosts. Chris, what's going on with this?

58:50.320 --> 58:57.440
Can you update us? It cuts. It cuts. It cuts. Yeah, it's in the progress. We have to build

58:57.440 --> 59:03.040
a bunch of tooling. So my plan is to start actually with the office hours and self-hosted

59:03.040 --> 59:06.640
member feeds we're working on and probably eventually code a radio member feed and make

59:06.640 --> 59:12.400
them boostable first. You know, once we get that kind of dialed in, probably transition

59:13.360 --> 59:17.840
the older shows, but not start necessarily with the biggest and the oldest show. You know what I

59:17.840 --> 59:22.000
mean? I want to break everything first. I feel like office hours is the place where we get to play and

59:22.960 --> 59:27.360
often things might not work, but often it might lead to some great things. Thanks for the double

59:27.360 --> 59:34.240
boost, true grits. Nev boosted in seven days ago, 500 sets. I think the best part of the live feeds

59:34.240 --> 59:38.800
are the conversations you and the community have. For example, when the Libidwadia changes dropped

59:38.800 --> 59:43.120
and we're all complaining about Gnome, a Gnome contributor came in one day and there was quite

59:43.120 --> 59:48.160
the long debate about an hour long between Neil and him. In my opinion, content like that should

59:48.160 --> 59:52.160
be available somewhere, even if it's behind a paywall. I often find myself commenting on the

59:52.160 --> 59:57.360
live feeds more than on the shows themselves. I specifically remember that episode. It was

59:57.360 --> 01:00:02.000
fabulous. Um, we kind of let that discussion go on because it was, there was so much quality there.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.040
And I think, did we, did we do the show late by an hour because of it or? Yeah, yeah, I think so.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:12.400
And then it, and then it continued after we wrapped up the show, it continued. It sure did. Yeah. The

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:18.240
show is just like an earmark in that conversation. Um, but that is available to members, right?

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:23.840
Jupiter.party. So if you are a member, it is on the feeds there. So that would be a good place

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:27.520
to find it if you're looking for it. I believe the episode is fairly easy to find. I don't have

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:33.840
it on the tip of my tongue, but, um, you can use, uh, notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com to, uh, find

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:41.280
when that was mentioned. Boost! Dylann wrote in seven days ago, 3500 sets. Great to see you so

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:46.320
motivated on a new show like this. Excited to see more of office hours. Well, it's really cause

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:51.040
Brent keeps showing up. Let's be honest. No, I am very excited about office hours. I've been

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.360
enjoying it. The one thing I'd like to expand on in the pre and post show is interaction with the

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:59.440
mumble room and just asking questions about what's going on at JB or in the matrix room,

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.200
but we're getting there. We can also do it through boosts. Uh, and so far we've been doing this

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:08.240
sponsor free. I think that'll probably change next quarter, but, uh, right now I've just,

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:11.520
you know, we've just kind of been doing it to see as a grand experiment, but I think it'll stick

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:16.480
around. I've been enjoying it. And I really appreciate you guys boosting in subscribing,

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:19.760
trying to find it in the, in fountain when you can't find it. Like everybody, I feel like people

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:24.640
have been going above and beyond to participate in the show. So I am super grateful. Uh, our buddy,

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:30.640
Dave Jones came in this week. Boost! He says, uh, man, I'm loving office hours. I just started

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:40.720
listening. What is open sets? So Dave, Dave boosted in 2000, 112 sets, 15%, uh, 15% split of that is

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:48.800
going to go to open sets. 50% of all of the boost to office hours and Linux unplugged for the last

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:56.880
three weeks have been contributed to open sets. OpenSats is a 501c charity that contributes 100%

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:02.080
of the funds sent to their general fund, which is what we're doing. They send 100% of that to free

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:09.600
software projects. And a big reason why JB is embracing boosts and lightning payments is because

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.640
I actually believe this is a way through our audience. We can build a network of people

01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:19.760
participating in this payment system that will then be in a position to support free software

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:25.440
when free software projects come online. And that's a big part. It's like, this is like a

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.880
five, six year pic, you know, picture that I have in my head, but that's where I see this going.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:36.080
And I think it starts here. And I believe open sets could be an avenue to that future. So I've,

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:39.120
we've been contributing for three weeks. This will be the last episode because this is the

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.240
last episode of the month, by the way. And cause I'm going to be off the week that in two weeks.

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:48.160
And so that's what we've been doing for the last three weeks. We've been given open sets a cut.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:52.000
I love them. I looked into them. They look completely legit. You can also contribute

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.800
to their operational costs if you like, but right now we're just doing the general fund.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:59.440
So it all 100% goes to free software, a lot of it in the Bitcoin ecosystem, some of it,

01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:03.440
the best software in the Bitcoin ecosystem. And it's just been our way to contribute back

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:07.440
to open source. And it's been nice. Like we've sent some money their way, which I think is really

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:13.120
great. You know, I did notice that, uh, Dave sent in two, one, one, two sets. And, uh, if you're a

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:17.360
rush fan, that's one of their more famous albums. So I don't know if that was intentional, but

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:21.040
you know, send some love. I could see it being intentional. You have to let us know, Dave,

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:26.800
Dave. The golden dragon wrote in as well. Big ups for boosts. I think that the split

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:31.520
for open sets is phenomenal. Helping to fund open source projects in a meaningful way is

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:37.920
always a plus one in my book. See you next boost. Thanks for opening the office. These are so fun.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.280
Thanks golden dragon. See you next boost. How about this one? Turquoise Fox boosted in seven

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:53.680
days ago with 10,000 sats boost. And, uh, the boost to Graham just says fund the open source.

01:03:53.680 --> 01:04:01.840
Marcel wrote in again, double boost, by the way, cannot find office hours in fountain

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:07.520
tried with Chris and Jupiter broadcasting, but, uh, didn't find anything. Sorry about that. That

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:14.000
has been tricky. I did contact them and I haven't heard anything back on that. Although then, uh,

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:19.600
I noticed that, uh, Lima boosted in and said that they were able to find the right version of the

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:24.400
show and send it to that. So I don't know, man. And for me at first, it wasn't showing up.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.360
And then I got ahold of the devs and told them like, you know, this show isn't showing up,

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:33.280
but it's in the podcast index. And then I went back immediately to like get a screenshot for them.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.200
And I searched for it again and it fricking showed up. See, Chris, I'm just curious if it,

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:41.600
if it wasn't showing up for Marcel, how did he boost in the show? You must have snatched this

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:46.400
some other way. He could have been using breeze. Oh, okay. Okay. Or there might've been a boost

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.480
where Marcel explained it and I missed it, but that's a good question. I would like to know how

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:58.080
a mystery, a mystery. Maybe we just passed the test. I don't know. Gene Bean wrote in as well,

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:10.000
another double boost as a podcaster at what level of sats per minute does the streaming of sats

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.920
while people are listening become financially beneficial versus just a nice gesture?

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:20.640
This is a fabulous question. That's a great question. So to be clear right now,

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:28.000
I don't really see it as a replacement. I see it as an addition because messaging into the show

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.280
is a tricky thing and airtime is a very valuable thing. And so this has always been a balance that

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:38.400
we've really tried to strike here on the show. And so this has been the first time when there has

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:42.160
been a medium where somebody could send us a message from the podcast app while they're

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:46.560
listening. And I would receive it in a web app that gives me a feed of people's comments. And

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:52.640
here's the best part. I can't reply. There are times I would love to. I've even thought about

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:58.800
trying to figure out how to sometimes, but the best part is that I cannot reply. I probably

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:04.800
spend 20% of my working time, maybe even more than that, really managing, interacting with the

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:10.160
community. It is a massive chunk of my job. And so to be able to have something that comes in

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:15.200
that I can process as a JSON feed, that I can export as a CSV file, or that I can read in a

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:20.400
web interface and it's tagged with episodes, game changer for production, game changer for how I

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.480
receive feedback. And I love how fresh it is because there's coming right from the podcast

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:31.760
app. So I see this as a way to take something that has been sort of out of balance from the

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:36.960
beginning of podcasting to balancing it now. And I don't see it really replacing memberships or

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:43.520
sponsors forever, but I do wonder if there was some massive economic downturn and sponsorships

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:48.240
pulled back or people got really sick with memberships and everybody just got membership

01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:55.440
fatigue. So we had less Jupiter party members. I could see that maybe over time people transition

01:06:55.440 --> 01:07:00.240
to small amounts via streaming sets, but spread across thousands of listeners. Maybe it would add

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:04.720
up, but I've never really done the math because I don't really see it getting there for quite a

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:11.040
while. We're so early on this, right? There's really still so much infrastructure to be built.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:15.200
We don't even have yet a way to do this from like the website. That's all that would have to be

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.600
figured out. I'd like a way for people to be able to boost from the matrix chat room using a bot,

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:26.480
all that kind of stuff. It's getting here. It's close. We're just not there yet. So I don't see

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:31.680
it. I don't see it replacing anything yet. I love the idea. I suppose if I had any fantasy

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:40.240
about the future, it would be me living in my RV somewhere beautiful off-grid with my

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:45.920
internet connected dish somehow. My space dish. I'm living off of boosts because I would just

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:52.240
live minimal, you know, quietly. It's just somewhere peaceful where nobody was around,

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:55.840
just me and my podcast. And I get on and talk to my internet buddies. That'd be fine by me.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:00.560
And every now and then I come into town, you know, I do that for spurts of time now.

01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.760
I think it's a great question to keep in mind, you know, in the future of this development.

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:08.960
You know, in a year from now, we should ask ourselves the exact same question.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.160
That's a good one to ponder.

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:16.000
That is a good one. We also got a thank you boost in from Dylan. He sent 500 sats

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.040
into office hour three.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:17.840
That's actually a double.

01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:23.040
Yeah, he was just sending a boost into office hours three welcoming into the Suspenders Club.

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:29.440
I am a, I am rocking suspenders. It's funny as a man, there's not a lot of things people

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:34.160
will comment on your appearance about, but like, if you change your hair or you shave

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:40.720
your face or, or now I've discovered if you put suspenders on, it now becomes a topic

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:45.760
of conversation that is socially acceptable, apparently for anyone to talk about. I, on

01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:50.080
the other hand, am very uncomfortable about anyone commenting on my appearance at all.

01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:55.200
Right? Like I always find it very awkward. Like I, I find like I leaned into the hair

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.880
thing, obviously that fight I just gave into, cause let's be honest, come on.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:04.080
But like the, like the suspenders stuff and the beard stuff, I always find it very weird.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.440
You know, it's very uncomfortable. A little bit of news before we wrap up.

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:11.360
Brett, check this out. You're familiar with Umbral.

01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.920
Oh yeah. You made me play with it a whole bunch of times.

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:19.360
It's one of my new loves of 2022. It is a personal server OS for self-hosting

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:23.360
with a brilliant app store, tons of some of the best free software out there.

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:29.120
Plus it integrates nicely and with Tor. So you can have things that are technically

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.560
accessible remotely, but without opening a port on your firewall.

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:38.480
And it's how we do our Bitcoin lightning node. So when people send in sets,

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.640
it's landing on an Umbral node that's physically here in the studio.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.120
One bit of feedback that Umbral got, and I got it too is, Hey, I love that, you know,

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:51.360
I can run my own Bitwarden or I can run my own mumble server, or I can run all of this stuff,

01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.920
but I don't really want to run a Bitcoin node. I don't want to allocate 500 gigs of disk space.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:06.240
And now with Umbral 0.5, which came out today, as we are recording, they have extracted the

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:11.200
lightning node and Bitcoin node as their own components that are an app that you can install.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:17.040
So you can now install Umbral just as an app platform to run things nicely inside Docker,

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.680
and then if you want it to be a Bitcoin node, you just install that app. And along with that,

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:28.800
they've completely redone the UI. So they got a whole new look and they've now introduced the

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:34.480
ability for apps to be independently updated without having to do a whole OS update like

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:38.800
they had in the past. Before you'd have to update the entire image. Now they've broken that out.

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.520
They've also got some credential management stuff built in here now.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:48.000
I'm very excited about this update, Brent. I feel like, again, if you've got a Raspberry Pi

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.400
sitting around or something equivalent, this is fantastic. You could go get this going up

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.480
in seconds, but I feel like they just they took it to the next level with this release

01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:01.200
because not only did they uncouple the Bitcoin and lightning node stuff, which is, I think,

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:04.880
something you should install, even if you don't use lightning much. It's nice to just

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:09.120
help decentralize the network. I love that kind of stuff, but I think it's smart that

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.720
they detached that. And then the other thing they've done that's really smart

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:20.160
is they've now got an official one liner that you can copy and paste. You got to make that

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:24.720
determination if it's safe or not for yourself, but a one liner that you can copy and paste now

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:30.160
and you can get up and up and running on any Debian or Ubuntu based system. So it doesn't

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:34.640
even have to be a Raspberry Pi anymore. You don't have to do any weird scripts like I did.

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:40.960
They've now got an official simple one line install to take any Ubuntu or Debian based system

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:45.680
and make it run as an umbral box. And then once you've done that, you get their platform for

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:50.240
installing applications, managing them, and it is great. It is really great. I know you could just

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:55.440
run stuff in Docker because you're a big shot out there, but this is so great. I don't often I don't

01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:00.080
often brag about like these things that let you I'm not even a portainer guy. Like I'm not I'm not

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:06.080
a Web UI to manage your containers guy. But man, is this great and I am big on sovereign data and

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:10.400
bringing your stuff home and I am big on decentralized computing and I'm big on putting

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:17.520
your stuff on your own land. So this has like prism in there. It has Pyhole, it has Node-RED,

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:24.400
it has Nextcloud, Home Assistant, Uptime Kuma, so many great apps, plus a bunch of stuff for the

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:28.800
Bitcoin ecosystem and the Lightning ecosystem. So it just felt like a special day because we

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:32.560
got a brand new version of PeerTube today. We've been talking about that. And we got a brand new

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:37.520
version of umbral, which has been in the works forever. And they all landed right as we were

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:43.040
recording. This is a huge step for both these projects. And for umbral, 0.5 now marks the first

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:48.240
release as just a general personal server OS. I feel like they're doing a good job of listening

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:51.920
to their audience. We've mentioned a few times, you know, this is this is the second time in this

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:58.160
show some project listens to some of your hopes for where the project can go. But it does also

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:02.560
seem like a little bit of a shift of direction for them, which I'm curious on your opinion of

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:07.360
that. You know, they kind of came in as the Bitcoin, you know, making your Bitcoin node

01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:10.960
easy to get up and running, especially on a Raspberry Pi. And now it seems like they're

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:18.800
maybe I'll call it maturing or refocusing slightly to being sort of a, you know,

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.840
run your great community Docker containers here. Oh, by the way, we also do Bitcoin and

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:29.200
lightning nodes. So I wonder what you think of that. That'd be good interview question. My sense

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:33.680
of it would be they got into this market and realized what a demand there is for doing this

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:38.960
right. And realize that they could address even more people if they decoupled the Bitcoin stuff.

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:45.200
And I think that's a clever insight. And I think they're doing in a way that isn't making it any

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:49.600
less of its original purpose. It's still it's still great as a Bitcoin node. In fact, I'd argue

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:54.720
this is even a better way to do it now because now you can update that independently of the major OS.

01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:58.160
It's a tight line to walk. If we get an opportunity to chat with them,

01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:02.000
I might take them up on that. I think I think we should try to do that. Sounds fascinating.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:07.600
All right, Brantley, let's see. We're not going to have an episode for this month after this.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:13.360
This is only one episode because our regular episode on the 21st that would be live and then

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:18.080
released on the Friday the 24th. Well, I'm going to be in Montana with the family. So we're taking

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:23.840
that week off, but we'll be back after that. You can always check out Jupiter broadcasting

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:28.880
dot com slash calendar for our live times. And of course, if you just follow Jupiter tube,

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:32.320
you'll know when we go live as well and you can always hang out there. And of course,

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:35.920
the show comes out on Fridays. If you go to office hours dot hair slash subscribe,

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.920
you get the RSS feed and then you don't got to worry about it. It's true. Go get more Brent

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:45.440
on Linux unplugged. There's always stuff going on over there. I always appreciate that. So true.

01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.360
So true, Brent. How true is it, Chris? It's so true. It's time to close the door.

01:14:49.360 --> 01:15:15.440
Clear out, everybody. Office hours are over. Go on. Get out of here.
