1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,280
Nestled against the San Gabriel Mountains near Pasadena, California, is a gateway to

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,400
the solar system and beyond.

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,560
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a NASA facility, it has been managed since the time of its

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:28,840
creation by the California Institute of Technology, or Caltech.

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,400
When visitors first enter the laboratory's museum, they are greeted by an image of three

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:40,680
space pioneers from a half century ago, captured in a moment of celebration.

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,840
Explorer was forged in the cauldron of the Cold War, at a time when JPL was building

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,480
not spacecraft, but missiles that carried atomic weapons.

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:00,560
This is the story of how JPL entirely changed direction and purpose.

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,240
This is also the story of a satellite that would give the world the very first space

11
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:11,760
science discovery, one that would change our understanding of how life on Earth came to

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,480
be.

13
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,800
It's Office Hours with me, Chris.

14
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,440
Hello everybody, welcome into Office Hours.

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,060
It's a special one we're packing to hit the road.

16
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,840
It is our last production in studio, and of course that means Brent Lee is in the office

17
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
with me.

18
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,840
Welcome in.

19
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
Save the seat for you.

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
It is very cozy.

21
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,000
I forgot how cozy it is in here.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,360
Yeah, it's because I forgot to turn off the oven actually.

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
Oh.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
Yeah.

25
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,040
I was cooking and I just left it on.

26
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,560
It's not the most efficient way, but you know.

27
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
It's something.

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,560
I was busy.

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,520
By oven, do you mean the computers that run the studio?

30
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
Basically.

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
Okay.

32
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
Gosh, they're always running, I tell you.

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,900
If I can keep them up.

34
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,160
Sometimes they go walk in and they've crashed, but that's a story for another time.

35
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,240
Brent, are you really here?

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,720
Did it actually happen?

37
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,080
I just snuck in overnight and you didn't even realize it.

38
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,080
It's incredible.

39
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,080
Wow.

40
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,280
And we have a mumble room here too with us as well.

41
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,080
Hello mumble room, time appropriate greetings.

42
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
Hey, Chris.

43
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,080
Hey, Brent.

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,080
Hey, guys.

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,080
Hello.

46
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,080
Hello.

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,040
And hello everybody watching live over at Jupiter.Tube.

48
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,040
So I was watching the live tracker last night before I hit the hay and I saw that you were

49
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:34,000
entering a very dense region of the Washington state and an area with no cell signal, lots

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,960
of wildlife, windy roads, and then to make things even more interesting, we have a ton

51
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,520
of wildfire smoke in the area.

52
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,640
So visibility is low.

53
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,160
And because you like to do it in the hardest way possible, you were driving at night too.

54
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
Not exclusively.

55
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,920
I had maybe, I think maybe two and a half hours of nighttime driving.

56
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:58,360
You probably had though, like the most treacherous part of the driving at night.

57
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,760
You have no idea what I went through.

58
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,760
Oh yeah?

59
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
What happened?

60
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,760
What happened?

61
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,660
Well, most of the drive actually was quite similar to that.

62
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,280
So I came from, you know, eastern side of BC.

63
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:17,100
And so I just, I think I did like five mountain passes, two on the Canadian side.

64
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,360
And then I think it's three on this.

65
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,360
It's ridiculous.

66
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,600
So, so many mountains you have to drive past.

67
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,400
And I could have driven south through Seattle and had the flat easy, you know.

68
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Yeah.

69
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,840
And 20 is our most treacherous, like built old school, like the way they used to build

70
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
them.

71
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,120
Which is like, just follow the mountain.

72
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Yeah.

73
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,120
There were a few subterranean tunnels just after the Diablo point that I forgot about.

74
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,920
We drove that together 2018.

75
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,400
Yeah, probably.

76
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,240
And I forgot about those tunnels.

77
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Those were great.

78
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Yeah.

79
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Yeah.

80
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,360
That is though, that's like the route that I don't really take the RV.

81
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
I've done it a few times.

82
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
I have.

83
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,360
I've done it.

84
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
Yeah.

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
It's something.

86
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,360
It's something.

87
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,520
There's like some serious switchbacks and there's large portions where I'm like shifting

88
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
and you know.

89
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Yeah.

90
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
I had an active game yesterday.

91
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
Yeah.

92
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,520
I had a lot of fun with it.

93
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,520
Yeah, you can.

94
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,520
If you've got a sporty car, you can, you know.

95
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
I do not.

96
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,880
Well, I mean, if you can take corners and stuff in that thing pretty well.

97
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,200
Well, like my car is nothing special.

98
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,280
It's an old vibe from the early 2000s.

99
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
You did install that supercharger.

100
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
Well, there's that.

101
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,280
Yeah.

102
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,280
It sticks out the back.

103
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
It's kind of weird.

104
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,280
Yeah.

105
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,280
And it makes kind of a farting duck noise.

106
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Yeah.

107
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
Just ignore that part.

108
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,280
Yeah.

109
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
It's the performance that counts.

110
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
I thought maybe that was cool in Canada.

111
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,280
But it's not.

112
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,280
The Canucks?

113
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Yeah.

114
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,280
The Canuck boost.

115
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,080
It's standard.

116
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,080
It's paid for.

117
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
It's like the healthcare system.

118
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,080
Right.

119
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,080
You just get one for free.

120
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Okay.

121
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
Good.

122
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
Oh, gosh.

123
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,080
Yeah.

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,760
So I think the part of the road you're talking about is, yeah, certainly windy, certainly

125
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,080
mountain roads.

126
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,960
But it was like that for the most part.

127
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,880
I mean, the Okanagan section is more flat because there's a bunch of, I guess, trees

128
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,020
growing there with fruit on it that are amazing.

129
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,040
But most of the ride was exactly what you think it was.

130
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,560
So it was a very active drive.

131
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,120
It was 11 hours of very active driving, which is actually fine with me.

132
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
Zero traffic.

133
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Yeah.

134
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
Just like me in the mountains.

135
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,660
You took the long way in a way, but you took the most scenic way where there is the least

136
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,700
amount of people.

137
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,520
And if I have a choice, I'll take that route, although I usually take it in the day.

138
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,120
If you take it in the day, there's like waterfalls and all kinds of elks.

139
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,600
Most of the drive was in the day.

140
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Oh, yeah.

141
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
I did see a bear.

142
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
Right.

143
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Which was pretty cool.

144
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
Yeah.

145
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
I tried to get a little video of it for you.

146
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,600
But these things, turns out they're kind of fast.

147
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Yeah.

148
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,400
And they always look smaller on the cell camera than they do in person.

149
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Yeah.

150
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,120
Tons of deer and stuff is really nice.

151
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,240
And beautiful views despite the thick smoke that followed me the entire way.

152
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,840
It's sort of like last year's road trip.

153
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,980
It's just a cloud of smoke over us, and I think it's going to be like that again.

154
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,240
We were that close, Brent.

155
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
Oh, man.

156
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
Almost.

157
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
We were like...

158
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:00,240
So we tactically timed the road trip to be late September to try to make it after wildfire

159
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,720
season and to try to also...

160
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,720
And the heat.

161
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
Yeah.

162
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,280
We may be successful on the heat part, but I don't think we're going to avoid the smoke.

163
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,280
I just...

164
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Poor dupes.

165
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
Oh, man.

166
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,120
She always gets driven in the most extreme conditions.

167
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,680
You know, I was thinking about that though, and this is a total departure, but from what

168
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,480
I've learned about wood stoves is that smoke actually has a lot of combustibles in it.

169
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,740
Something like 70% of the energy in a log is from the smoke because a lot of combustibles

170
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,740
in there.

171
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,040
There's no fire that's hot enough to burn that to have a clean burning, right?

172
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,100
So then I was wondering yesterday, because it's 11 hours of being in the car doing nothing,

173
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,680
in an engine, if it's taking in that smoky air, is that actually a benefit?

174
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,760
Is there some kind of...

175
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,280
Probably not, but you know, that's where my brain goes.

176
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
Yeah, because it doesn't want those...

177
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,800
You know, I'm sure it doesn't want those foreign materials anywhere in the combustion

178
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
chambers, but...

179
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Why not?

180
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
You know what you do need?

181
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
You need like a bizarre collector.

182
00:06:53,800 --> 00:07:00,280
So on a Federation starship, a standard Federation, NCC class starship, you see you got bizarre

183
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,880
collectors that are soaking up like radiation and gases and supposedly converting that to

184
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,560
energy in the ship.

185
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,160
That's what those red nobbins are on the end of the warp nacelles.

186
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,800
You just need something like that on chupes.

187
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,600
It's like got a big vacuum face that sits on the roof just collecting stuff, and then

188
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,480
she burns that and generates energy and charges the batteries.

189
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,760
I mean, I think you're onto something.

190
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
Red nobbins.

191
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,760
That's the next thing.

192
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,240
So it was a smooth drive, no incidents or anything?

193
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,760
I did have an incident, actually.

194
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:35,760
I survived it, which is good, but there was a part of the mountain that ended up raining

195
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,680
on the mountain.

196
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,720
So I'm, I think, a pretty aware driver.

197
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
I agree.

198
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
I think you're a good driver.

199
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,160
And downshifting, you know, not burning your brakes up going down these passes and stuff.

200
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,320
If you've driven mountain passes, you shouldn't ride your brakes all the way down.

201
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,600
Bad, bad idea.

202
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,040
So lots of active shifting and stuff.

203
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,840
But some of these corners are crazy tight and it was raining.

204
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,120
I have some all weather tires, which are winter rated, but they're kind of all seasons that

205
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,240
are winter rated.

206
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,400
They've been amazing for me.

207
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,320
They're great, great tires from Nokian, I think it is.

208
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,920
And I did a thing that Alex will shake his head at.

209
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Okay.

210
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,720
So I was downshifting into a corner and I thought I was doing fine.

211
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,200
But then this one particular corner, it was like a going down a mountain pass, you know,

212
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,520
you got to kind of slow your speeds down.

213
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,960
I think it was like a 40 or 35 recommended turn.

214
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,160
And what were you doing?

215
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,320
Yeah, it's hard because I get kilometers.

216
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,840
I think usually I was doing like five over that.

217
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
Oh, okay.

218
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
For most of the corners, totally, totally fine.

219
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,840
You got a small car.

220
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
Yeah, yeah, that's it, right?

221
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,840
It's totally fine.

222
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,360
But this particular corner, I guess, surprised me in the sense that it was wetter than I

223
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
expected.

224
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,920
And so I was going into the corner and was gearing down and stuff, but that wasn't quite

225
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,920
enough.

226
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,540
So I did the thing you're not supposed to do.

227
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,320
And I am kicking myself.

228
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,120
I just put my foot on the brakes slightly and I hit the brake right in the like apex

229
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
of the corner.

230
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,320
That's exactly what you don't want to do.

231
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,240
There's this like, human reaction versus what is the right thing.

232
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,440
It's like just the other day, I was going a little bit faster than I should and a cop

233
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,240
pulled in behind me and I know I shouldn't hit my brakes because that just sort of signals

234
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,480
to him that I know I'm speeding, right?

235
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
But I couldn't help it.

236
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
I just hit the brakes.

237
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
No, what are you doing?

238
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Don't hit the brakes.

239
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Just coast a little bit.

240
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
You're good.

241
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,480
You're good.

242
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Yeah, it's just like you can't help it.

243
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
It's instinct.

244
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,800
So unfortunately for me, what that meant was that the front end started sliding out.

245
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,080
And this is a pretty tight corner.

246
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:44,800
So thankfully I, you know, as a kid drove a bunch of machinery and very sketchy forest

247
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
areas.

248
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,900
So you kind of have a sense of what to do in these situations.

249
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:54,520
So I ended up sort of starting to skid sideways down the road around this curve.

250
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,040
It was you drifted the corner.

251
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,080
I needed a drone.

252
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,600
It would have been an amazing thing.

253
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,920
And so, you know, my like all the alarm bells are going off like this isn't good.

254
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:13,200
And thankfully I just kind of slid a little bit and, and my front end, which I think you

255
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,240
noticed this morning, my front end just kissed the mountain, like the, the smallest kiss

256
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,360
to the actual mountain face that I was going.

257
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
That's what that's from.

258
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
That's recent.

259
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,360
That's that I did see it.

260
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,360
Yeah.

261
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
It's a few hours old.

262
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Wow.

263
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,360
And I just to say caught my license plate on the front because we have license plates

264
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,000
on the front and it, it got pretty mangled.

265
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,640
I fixed it before coming here.

266
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,960
But also just kissed the fender on the front.

267
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,600
And I have it tied together with a few zip ties that I happen to have in the front seat.

268
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,160
But I love that you didn't say anything about this.

269
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,840
You haven't said a word about it because I thought it was amazing, dude.

270
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
It's the podcasters dilemma.

271
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Right?

272
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Do you say anything?

273
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Or do you record?

274
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
Wow.

275
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,840
So like, okay.

276
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,480
So you, you like, how much of that jolt did you feel like when you, when you kissed it?

277
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Like how much did you feel?

278
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,320
It was honestly pretty subtle.

279
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,640
I knew I was, did you know there was damage when you, well, I felt like the slightest

280
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,760
little bump, like, like almost like you're parking your car at the grocery store and

281
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,120
you just to say, nudge the, you know, just the smallest little thing.

282
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,600
And I thought, I know cars, they're so sensitive.

283
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,620
You touch anything, they just fall apart.

284
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,000
So I knew there was something, but the worst part was not the sliding.

285
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,640
I'm fine with that.

286
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:30,920
The worst part was then I was stopped in the middle of the road, oh geez, perpendicular

287
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:37,400
to the road with my nose against a mountain face and a, you know, to my right, which is

288
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
up the hill.

289
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,880
I just came from, it's a total blind corner.

290
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,520
So anyone coming down there would never, ever, ever expect a car to be where I was.

291
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,880
So then I was like, okay, now's the time to perform.

292
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,880
I got to get out of this.

293
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,880
Right?

294
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
Right.

295
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,680
So thankfully I was able, I had to do actually a, like a double, um, three point turn.

296
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,520
I had to go front, back, front, back.

297
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,480
It was Austin Powers thing.

298
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,960
The worst thing to do in the middle of the night.

299
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,680
I think I can almost picture where you're at.

300
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,000
So you were coming down probably the last pass.

301
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Is this your last?

302
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
Yeah, I think it was on highway 20.

303
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Yeah.

304
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Those are some tight corners.

305
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,880
That one is just the one caught me, you know, the rest were totally great.

306
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,920
Can you believe I took the RV through there a few times?

307
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,240
I think if, if you're going super slow, it's like actually great.

308
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
Yeah.

309
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
You got to really go slow.

310
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,000
But when you're, when you're 25,000 pounds going really slow is hard.

311
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,400
And I think, I don't think I took the rain into account.

312
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Right.

313
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
To be honest.

314
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Right.

315
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
It was a lot worse.

316
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Yeah.

317
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Yeah.

318
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,600
So I got out of there and there were actually no cars around and there weren't for most

319
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,600
of the trip.

320
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
That's actually fine.

321
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
But yeah.

322
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,960
Um, any other route and there would have been a steady stream of vehicles.

323
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,960
Yeah.

324
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Yeah.

325
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,760
So it turned out to be fine, but it had my, uh, blood pump in there for a second, but

326
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,240
that kept you awake for a little bit longer.

327
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,240
Right.

328
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
That's why I was awake.

329
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
That worked.

330
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,240
Do that next time.

331
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,240
Wow.

332
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,120
So we'll have to do a few little repairs on my, uh, my front end there.

333
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,480
I'm not sure if there's cell signal in that spot either.

334
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
No, no.

335
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Oh no.

336
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,320
So thankfully I was able to, um, get turned around, go down the road a little bit more

337
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,760
and like a few hundred feet, there was a little turnoff.

338
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,120
So I turned off immediately there and, uh, just, you know, let things cool out down in

339
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,960
my own body, but also just take a look.

340
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,540
And, uh, first thing I was like, oh yeah, no cell signal, no buddy around really.

341
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,120
And that's what I was thinking about is like, okay, well if something actually does happen

342
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,440
up here, especially if the only car that you see just crashed into you, then, then,

343
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,800
you know, you know, you mentioned how these roads were built a long time ago and it made

344
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,080
me think how crazy was it and building those roads.

345
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Many men died.

346
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Oh, I know.

347
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
It's insane.

348
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,180
That outlook I'd like to take you to, I was telling you about tells you, they have a few

349
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,360
plaques there that tell you about some of the sacrifices.

350
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Oh man.

351
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
It's insane.

352
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
Yeah.

353
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
And we just take it for granted.

354
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Yeah.

355
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
It really is something.

356
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
And they didn't have geared nearly as good as we have now.

357
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
Right.

358
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:54,120
So, all right, well we've got a few things I want to get into, including some JB updates

359
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,920
and website updates, but also some podcasting news and Gene Bean actually kicks it off with

360
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:12,240
our baller boost this week with 30,000 sats.

361
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,540
So he says, I just saw that Albee has released Saturn and I couldn't think of a better way

362
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,560
to let you know about it other than a boost.

363
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,560
He's right about that.

364
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,940
I curious what you think of it.

365
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:26,160
By the way, Gene Bean on Fountain, but sometimes it uses my Twitter handle.

366
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
No worries, Gene Bean.

367
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,200
We got you.

368
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,920
So Albee is a web lightning wallet.

369
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:39,480
It's something that's been sort of on my radar for a while and then the last few weeks I've

370
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,800
ended up having a conversation with one of the co-founders.

371
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,240
I've set up an Albee wallet.

372
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,180
I'm actually really impressed with it and I typically am super skeptical of anything

373
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,620
that touches the web browser, but Albee does a couple of things like it lets you use your

374
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,800
own node, you know, let you use your own seed phrase and encryption.

375
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,860
It does a couple of things that I think are really smart and I think for lightning payments

376
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:03,440
to really take off, you probably need some kind of web integration and Albee is a really

377
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,040
solid project.

378
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,480
They've been also working with the Podverse crew to get boosting working on Podverse mobile

379
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,200
and now they've introduced Saturn and it's sat earn, get it?

380
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,080
It's a value for value platform for podcasters.

381
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,300
It's kind of like what you get when you set up Umbral and Helipad where we get all the

382
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,000
boosts and stuff.

383
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,560
They're building that for any podcaster who doesn't necessarily want to set all that up.

384
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
That is really cool.

385
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,360
It's very cool, Brent.

386
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,460
They have a dashboard now that shows you who's boosting in, number of boosts that you've

387
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:40,240
got, but they also, look at this, are giving you metrics.

388
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,800
So they're generating metrics on the fly to show you like your boost performance, episode

389
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,640
releases in correlation to metrics, boost to gram revenues, all that kind of stuff to

390
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,120
just give people a dashboard to receive these.

391
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Now I actually have no intention of using this, right?

392
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,280
Because like we're not trying to generate a big, big set of business revenues from anything

393
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,840
like this and Helipad is really great for what we use.

394
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,400
I love Helipad.

395
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,040
It's a tool built by Dave Jones, the pod sage of podcasting 2.0.

396
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,960
It takes the messages on lightning payments and it displays them in a nice UI, categorizes

397
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,360
them by show and episode number.

398
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,000
So it enables like a CVS file export, but the cool thing is it's a Rust app with an

399
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,480
actual like database back end.

400
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
It's a what?

401
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
It's a Rust app.

402
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,480
Yeah.

403
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
What did you say?

404
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,480
All right, fine.

405
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Fine.

406
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Hey.

407
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Yeah.

408
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Are you happy now?

409
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,320
I do it for the people.

410
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,800
And you know, it has an API and all that.

411
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,320
So we're actually very happy with Helipad and our own homespun solution.

412
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,360
But if you were getting into podcasting or if you had a podcast and you weren't really

413
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,880
interested in hosting all the stuff yourself.

414
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,740
Or you just want a different UI on top of it, I suppose.

415
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,800
This is a great system.

416
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,640
And what's cool about this is we could use this.

417
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,400
We could just add this destination as one of our splits, like, you know, a tiny split,

418
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,180
like a five sat split or something, six, 10, so it's clear, you know, a five sat split.

419
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,280
And then we would send a copy of all the messages in here and the team could log in and read

420
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
the messages that way.

421
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,520
Aren't you curious to just give it a spin just to see?

422
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
I kind of am.

423
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,320
I kind of am, but I really like our current workflow as well.

424
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,360
Well, and I think our workflow, what's it been, like eight months now?

425
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,360
Yeah.

426
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,720
I think has informed a lot of the decisions and the learning that we've done.

427
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,880
Like having to build it from the ground up like that has been really fascinating and

428
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
very educational.

429
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Yeah.

430
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
And I like the self-hosting aspect.

431
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Yeah, absolutely.

432
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,720
But the Albie team seems really solid.

433
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,480
They're making open source stuff over there and they're working with other projects.

434
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,640
They're kind of filling the market gap to make some of the aspects of podcasting 2.0

435
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,620
a little more turnkey for other podcasters.

436
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,620
That's a great service.

437
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:56,360
It really is because the other pressure here is, you know, you got your Spotify's, but

438
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,500
you also just have your micro ad platforms.

439
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,440
This is a new thing they're doing, micro ads.

440
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,900
You enter your podcast into a database and you put some attributes in there about your

441
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:11,040
audience like average size, where they work, average age, like they'll give you tools to

442
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,160
survey your audience if you don't know that information.

443
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,880
So you can ask everybody to go take a survey and then give them all that information and

444
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,240
then you plug all that in there and you tell it like keywords about what you talk about

445
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,520
and then they have another side of the system that advertisers log into and then they filter

446
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,800
on those attributes and then they select a bunch of podcasts that just check, check,

447
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,720
check and then they say run campaign and then on the back end, the podcasters get an email

448
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,480
that says, okay, podcaster, you've got a campaign for this, some product you've never heard

449
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,080
of for some company you know nothing about, you know, no idea, no idea if it's a scam

450
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,040
and that's how a ton of this scam stuff gets, gets around is nobody really knows anything

451
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,440
about the companies they're doing deals with.

452
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,360
No one's doing research on the product.

453
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,360
Yeah.

454
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
Have they necessarily ever seen it?

455
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Right.

456
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
And they're making it easier and easier.

457
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,240
You just go put your information in there and then you just end up with an email and

458
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,560
they're, they tell you, do the ads, you agree to it and then you get paid and that stuff

459
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:07,680
sucks because they're like for stupid crap, they're for dumb services and just all kinds

460
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,680
of stupid stuff.

461
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:12,920
Um, I, uh, here, I'll get you, here's, here's an example actually, I was going to save this

462
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,560
for Coder, but, uh, I do actually have, um, I do have a current example.

463
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,080
Let's see if I go over here.

464
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,080
I saved it.

465
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,960
Yeah, here we go.

466
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,720
So Dennis wrote in just, this is the email.

467
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,800
Can you give me a quote on your best reseller prices for the following, please?

468
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:35,240
I'd like your regular guest posts, non gambling, and I'd like a price for your gambling guest

469
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
posts.

470
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,240
Looking forward to hearing from you.

471
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,200
Kind regards, Dennis.

472
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,240
Now you could just reply here to Dennis and say, yeah, here's our price and Dennis could

473
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,240
choose to buy it.

474
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,720
And then we're supposed to just run a low key like segment on gambling.

475
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Uh, I don't know.

476
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,120
It's just so funny, all these guys, and we get this kind of stuff all the time.

477
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,820
And this, that's not even the automated stuff.

478
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,760
That's just like, you know, somebody's mass mailing shows that they find in iTunes database

479
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
and stuff like that.

480
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,360
So yeah, Gene Bean, uh, I'm very excited about Saturn from Albee.

481
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,400
I think it's going to be a great stepping stone for folks that are trying to get a boost

482
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,720
enabled on their show and they don't necessarily know about all the infrastructure and they

483
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,080
don't know about the helipad app.

484
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,680
And, uh, Albee seems like a really solid team.

485
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,080
I like what they're doing over there too.

486
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,080
So I have good faith that they're going to do right.

487
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,520
And I think they're really investing in podcasting 2.0.

488
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,000
It's neat to see like even from week to week, I guess two weeks from fortnight to fortnight

489
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,280
when we do this show, how things are evolving in that time every couple of weeks.

490
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
And I'm only handpicking.

491
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
Yeah.

492
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,280
Right.

493
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,840
Like there's several stories I'm just leaving on the table because you know, there's, there's

494
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,600
other outlets that are covering podcasting news.

495
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,720
I just want to cover, I'm covering the stuff here that I want the JV audience to be aware

496
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,720
of.

497
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,800
Um, but pod news.net is another one if you're interested.

498
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,280
And then I think the podcasting 2.0 show, if you're interested in this stuff is, is

499
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,040
a must listen.

500
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,120
So Brent, let's do a little reflection on, uh, your matrix adoption, because I think

501
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,280
when we started this show, you were kind of like matrix and you're using matrix, which

502
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,520
we use for our live chat right now, people are suggesting titles as we go along.

503
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,040
But now, you know, after this website project, I feel like you're on a whole, you have a

504
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,040
whole other perspective.

505
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Yeah.

506
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,040
You've caught me in that one.

507
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:20,680
I, uh, I was a little skeptical at first and I think, you know why it's because the user

508
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,800
interfaces were really kind of rough, even just several months ago.

509
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,800
Yeah.

510
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:32,160
And I was like, oh man, if this is the situation we're, um, suggesting that our audience subscribed

511
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,360
to, I don't like that idea at all.

512
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:39,100
So I was skeptical is a nice way to put it to the point where I actually uninstalled

513
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,960
it for myself for a few months.

514
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,800
Um, you convinced me to grab it up again, thankfully, while you didn't give me much

515
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,960
choice with the show, I think is really what happened.

516
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,480
But even then, like to, to go on that concept again and in those few months, I'd say, you

517
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,340
know, element primarily that I've been using, uh, I've tried a few others, but that one

518
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,760
has seen a lot of, uh, work.

519
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,360
I I've of course, as you might expect, put in a few bug reports on element, which is,

520
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,980
and the team responded really quickly, which is great, but it's been lovely.

521
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,200
And I've seen the JB adoption be really good as well.

522
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,400
And I have loved many aspects of it.

523
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:19,040
I want to go into detail, but the JB website room specifically, which I spend, I'll say

524
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:25,480
probably like 80% of my time in cause the people there are great, has seen a crazy amount

525
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,520
of people in it for the project that we're doing.

526
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,440
I thought, yeah, it started slow.

527
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:35,400
We were like, you know, 10 people or so now I think we're up to almost a hundred and uh,

528
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,960
every now and then I stop and think, Oh, well it feels like a tiny little like room of just

529
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,840
a bunch of friends working in here and it's great, but actually there's a hundred friends

530
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
had sitting in this room.

531
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,840
It's really cool.

532
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,600
So thank you for everyone who's been interested in the website, you know, even if you're just

533
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,000
in there just to sort of hear what's happening and not necessarily contribute.

534
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,960
I think that's still worthwhile, but, um, I've seen a huge massive uptake in the number

535
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,880
of people contributing recently as well.

536
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,600
So, uh, that's been really, really amazing.

537
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:11,880
I feel like at the beginning of 2022, we were still, all of us as a team were like, uh,

538
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,160
was this a good idea?

539
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,880
Oh, this is a lot of work.

540
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,840
I'm not sure this is a good idea.

541
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,240
And then, you know, more than midway into the year, it's like, Oh boy, I'm sure glad

542
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,520
we made a bet on this platform.

543
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,200
This sure was the right way to go.

544
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
It's been really nice.

545
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,560
I like having the West coast crew in there to organize stuff for the West coast meetups.

546
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,040
And then we have, you know, the JB general chat for these events that we're doing and

547
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:35,240
the Linux unplugged rooms where we're talking about Linux unplug stuff in the Bitcoin chat

548
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:41,400
room that we've set up is gotta be the best, most level-headed, most respectful, you know,

549
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,440
Bitcoin conversation I've seen anywhere on the internet.

550
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,880
It's just, yeah, it really has been, um, really seems like it's been a good bet.

551
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,680
Like it was like, we, we bet kind of a risky, I feel like we were a little risky when we

552
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,960
bet cause there was big pushback, you know, our buddy Wimpy, you know, pushed really hard

553
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,600
to go with discord and we already have a discord set up and there's still value in it too.

554
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:06,680
I think you could still argue today, but you know, it's been also a good project for us.

555
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,560
It's been a good project to learn it, you know, implement things and, and really try

556
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,920
out some of these technologies and push the edges.

557
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:18,480
And uh, we broke things when we deployed the new website during the show last week or two

558
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,880
weeks ago, didn't even know it at the time because everything just seemed fine.

559
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,440
We were using the matrix chat while we're doing the show, you know, everybody voted

560
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
on titles.

561
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,680
We were talking to the live stream, it all seemed good after we deployed the website.

562
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,880
Like how could we have broken anything?

563
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
Right.

564
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,080
Um, and then the next day I noticed things were really kind of slow, but it was like

565
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,240
the last week of August and there was people chatting.

566
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,400
There was absolutely people chatting in there and I was actively chatting with you and Wes

567
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,760
in there and I thought, no, maybe people are taking, you know, you know, it is new.

568
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
It's new.

569
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,240
Maybe people are just down, you know, for the summer doing something and it's not quite

570
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,880
their habit yet to be in here.

571
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
Uh, okay.

572
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,880
All right.

573
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,440
I won't worry about it too much.

574
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
And I say something to Wes.

575
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
I'm like, you think anything's up?

576
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,560
I mean, usually by this point in the day I have several unread messages and I haven't,

577
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,880
I don't have any unread messages right now.

578
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
This is really weird.

579
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,880
You get a day off.

580
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
Yeah.

581
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
Right.

582
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,880
So, okay.

583
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,880
And I kind of think, well, good for everybody.

584
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
They're out getting some summertime.

585
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,880
Good.

586
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
Well, meanwhile, you're here worrying about it.

587
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,880
Yeah.

588
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,840
The next day, Thursday, cause the show was on a Tuesday, the next day, Thursday, I was

589
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,880
AFK for most of the day because I took an odd day off, which I don't usually, not really

590
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:31,200
off, but I was driving for a lot of that day looking for furniture for troops and, um,

591
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,240
just didn't, didn't have any chance to spend any time in the element room until the evening

592
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,480
at the matrix room and then I noticed it was slow again, okay.

593
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,680
Next morning though, Friday morning, I'm back at the work, I've been in the office early

594
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:46,560
and now I, by Friday I've expected to hear from several people and they haven't gotten

595
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
back to me.

596
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
I'm like, that's weird.

597
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,360
And they're all, and like some of the chat rooms have just been dead quiet.

598
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,360
Nothing said.

599
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,080
And I'm like, that doesn't seem right.

600
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,020
We've had an episode come out, the website's gone live, something's definitely wrong here.

601
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,400
Chatting was obvious because there were people in there chatting, but they were members of

602
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
that server.

603
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
Jupiter broadcasting.com server.

604
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
Oh, I see.

605
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,760
So people who were native to that server were chatting away just fine, but anybody that

606
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,280
came from a home server or a, maybe their matrix.org account, anybody that connected

607
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:23,560
via the federation wasn't there, but there was no air message and there's nothing obvious

608
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,720
about it.

609
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,480
And it wasn't until I decided to go create a brand new from scratch matrix.org account

610
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,280
and then try to connect in to the Jupiter broadcasting server.

611
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
That's what you had to do.

612
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Yeah.

613
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,880
Where I realized that direction isn't working.

614
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,480
Like I can go from the server, I can go out, but you couldn't get into the server.

615
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,440
And then from there, Wes and I started troubleshooting it.

616
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,180
Wes pretty quickly figured out, oh yeah, we had an identity file on the old website because

617
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:55,000
we use the Jupiter broadcasting.com domain and not the colony.Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

618
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,440
And so we had to have this file up there.

619
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,820
And then it was a matter of figuring out like, well, how do we do this now, right?

620
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:07,000
Because in the old days I would SFTP up to the server, copy the files and I'd be done.

621
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,200
And it would be like Wes and I would have known it happened.

622
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,200
There'd be no trace, there'd be no log, there'd be nothing.

623
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Memory only.

624
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Yeah.

625
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,080
But that's not how it works now.

626
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:25,400
So I'm like, okay, so first thing I got to go do is I got to go create a GitHub issue

627
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
identifying the problem.

628
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,760
So I got to document what the issue is and try to describe it best I can.

629
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,480
So I do that and then Wes jumps in with what he knows and then we had a fix pretty quickly

630
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,560
and then I'm deploying and he uploads that fix.

631
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,120
I'm deploying that fix from GitHub.

632
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,020
It rebuilds the website and a few minutes later everything was working on Matrix again.

633
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,740
But the new website did manage to break our Matrix Federation for a little bit.

634
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,700
And then it started reconnecting and people just started coming back online.

635
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,360
They had been chatting along all along.

636
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,400
It was like a fork almost.

637
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Yeah.

638
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,560
It was an IRC fork or a split or whatever they call it.

639
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
A net split.

640
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,560
But yeah, they just thought we were like not responding and we just thought they weren't

641
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,560
showing up.

642
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
They were like, oh, must be the end of the summer.

643
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,980
They're all still talking to each other because all their Federation connections are working

644
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,980
just fine.

645
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,600
So they're all just talking along.

646
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,240
And then I show up like three days later and they're like, oh, nice of you to show up.

647
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Right.

648
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,940
That's funny.

649
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:28,320
But before we fixed it, I'm like, oh, crap, you know what we've just done?

650
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,340
And Wes is like, what?

651
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:35,120
We have just missed the best window in the history of this server to do maintenance and

652
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
upgrades.

653
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
It's true.

654
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
Right.

655
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,760
So right before we fixed it, we did a bunch of like updates and stuff like that to bring

656
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,000
it all up to date.

657
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,160
So did you document that somewhere?

658
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,160
Oh, yeah.

659
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
Totally.

660
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,160
Totally.

661
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,000
And so, well, I have some questions there.

662
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,880
So in the end, how was the process to fix this?

663
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,480
Because you had to basically upload a file sort of.

664
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,480
Yeah.

665
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Yeah.

666
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,480
Yeah.

667
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,480
And Wes figured that out where it needed to live and all of that.

668
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,600
That actually, you know, I like I like the self documenting aspect of it.

669
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,000
Like if you go dig around on our GitHub, you could find that entire threat and see what

670
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
happened.

671
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,800
I think that's fascinating and valuable for an organization like ours.

672
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,880
So it's better overall.

673
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,440
It is it is a slower process.

674
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,440
In some ways.

675
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Right.

676
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
I guess.

677
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,560
But then again, it's kind of hard to say when you're building a website.

678
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:33,400
I think it's slower in the sense that you that day, it was slower for you to solve the

679
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,400
immediate issue.

680
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,400
Yeah.

681
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:39,200
I mean, I'm still like I could have probably just explained less in the GitHub issue, you

682
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,560
know, and I could have just kept it really short, I suppose.

683
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
And that would have been quicker.

684
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,880
But I wrote it out in case anybody had some other ideas.

685
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
And there was some discussion.

686
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,840
So it did it did result in some interesting discussion.

687
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,160
But the same I think it probably would take me about the same time to go to GitHub, create

688
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,880
the issue, write out a little bit about it, tag people or whatever.

689
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,360
That's probably about the same amount of time would take me to SFTP a file up to the server.

690
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,000
And I'd be fixed at that point.

691
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Right.

692
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,220
But that is the old, you know, dynamically generated website.

693
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,560
This is a new static generated statically generated website.

694
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,220
And so you need to like put it earlier in the process.

695
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,260
So it's kind of like the best.

696
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,260
There's not really.

697
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,520
I mean, I could have built it locally and uploaded files, I suppose, to a server.

698
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,680
But it doesn't seem like a better process.

699
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,440
It just seems like a different process.

700
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,200
Well, I think I'll argue that I think it's a better process.

701
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Yeah.

702
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
I think ultimately it will be.

703
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Yeah.

704
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Yeah.

705
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
For that kind of fix, I'm not positive.

706
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,580
But generally, in all other aspects, yes, I'm positive.

707
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,580
It's yeah.

708
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
Yeah.

709
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,580
I'm positive.

710
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,580
It's a good thing.

711
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,580
Yeah.

712
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,580
Because you get documentation.

713
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,580
Well, yeah, you get documentation.

714
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:50,200
And after well, OK, so my story is I spent two full days working exclusively on the website

715
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,680
and staying up far too late doing so and really enjoying myself.

716
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,840
So I think it was like the four in the morning or something.

717
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
Oh, wow.

718
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,840
Yeah.

719
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,440
And I was like, geez, it's really quiet in the matrix room, right?

720
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,920
Because everything's fine.

721
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,920
Nothing's broken.

722
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,280
That's it.

723
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:09,300
So I woke up that third day and I was able to just read everything that you and Wes

724
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,300
had done.

725
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,940
And I was fully caught up, which was great from that perspective.

726
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:19,480
But also, from the conversations that happened there, Elroy created a new end-to-end test

727
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,120
that checks that that matrix federation file exists.

728
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,480
So in the future, we will know pretty immediately when that's a problem.

729
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,400
Now there's a small issue with that test that we have to figure out that I think we'll get

730
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
there.

731
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
So it's not quite functional yet.

732
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,960
But I mean, that's, I think, some positivity that you get out of that process.

733
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,520
So you have to put a little bit more in, but you get these benefits that otherwise you

734
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
wouldn't get.

735
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
Yeah.

736
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,400
And that's what I mean, streamlined communication.

737
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,800
Because you came online after the issue was fixed.

738
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,800
But when you came online, you probably saw the messages saying, heads up, something's

739
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,800
broken.

740
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,560
So you come online, what you know immediately is, oh, something's broken.

741
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:03,240
But then you go to the GitHub issue and you know immediately, oh, it's already been resolved.

742
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,120
And you see the whole story.

743
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,000
It certainly kept me from reaching out to you in real time, interrupting whatever work

744
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,280
you were working on at the time that I was starting to get caught up in my day and such.

745
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,240
So I think there are benefits that maybe are hard to see.

746
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,240
Yeah.

747
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,240
Yeah.

748
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,900
It is a transition from one or two people managing something to a team of people.

749
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:29,440
And then, like you said, you get Elry's experience or oversight where he said, oh, I could modify

750
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,440
this so we actually will do a unit test for that and make sure we actually check to see

751
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,360
that file there so we never blow that away again.

752
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,040
Yeah, that kind of stuff, which a lot of us would never think of just because once we

753
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,560
have a fix, we're on to the next thing.

754
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,480
Yeah, what I've really appreciated from everyone who's been contributing is we all have different

755
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,320
specialties and different perspectives.

756
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,200
And so when a problem shows up, there's this hive mind of, oh, I'll fix this little part

757
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
of it.

758
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
And I'll fix this other part of it.

759
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,360
And then all of a sudden, you have a better solution than any one person could come up

760
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,360
with.

761
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
It's really great.

762
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,800
We should talk more about some website updates in a moment.

763
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:07,720
I wanted to say before we completely move off of Matrix, we are thinking a lot about

764
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,320
a member Matrix Room.

765
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,960
So if you're a member of any of the shows or Jupiter Party, we are talking as a team

766
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,760
like the best way to facilitate essentially like your own bat line, kind of like the

767
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,160
Boos are, but just sort of as a feedback mechanism.

768
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,680
And we are kind of having the conversation right now of just how clever do we want to

769
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
be, right?

770
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:33,080
Because obviously, we could do something as simple as email the members a link.

771
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,520
Or we could do something as clever as integrate with the API of our service provider and,

772
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,920
you know, authenticate and do it all in the back.

773
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,240
Like we're just trying to figure all that out.

774
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,840
So it'll probably be a post trip thing, along with the RSS feeds that we're going to start

775
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:47,840
taking over.

776
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,480
And in fact, you know, we've had some platform issues with the Fireside, our hosting provider.

777
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,380
Every hosting provider has issues from time to time.

778
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:01,560
So you have to take that into account, you know, if we moved it over all to Linode, could

779
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,560
Linode have an outage?

780
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,900
It's possible, right?

781
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,680
So would it be much better?

782
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:11,280
I think maybe, like this issue we had this week was the members version of CoderRadio

783
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:20,000
went out two days late because the episode got uploaded and set to go public, but it

784
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,620
just like was in like this infinite processing loop on their end.

785
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,920
And they didn't have like a timeout that says like, you know, after 15 minutes, maybe check

786
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,700
to see if this file is still encoding or whatever.

787
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,700
And although they don't encode it, we do, but they just process it, whatever that means.

788
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,520
And maybe it means copying it out to the CDM.

789
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,800
No, it's to make those great waveforms they have.

790
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,040
Yeah, that never changed.

791
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
And it just got stuck there.

792
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
Right?

793
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,360
And there's no air mechanism.

794
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,840
There's no alert.

795
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,240
There's no like, nothing gets triggered.

796
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,080
There's no like anything we can hook into.

797
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,080
There's no API.

798
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,080
That's too bad.

799
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
Yeah.

800
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,800
So we are, it's like as time goes on, it's like, maybe we just got to build all this

801
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:02,340
stuff again, even though there's so many platforms to make podcasting easier than ever.

802
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:08,000
It has in many ways, but I think often because the number, you know, the volume we're putting

803
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,360
out and we do some member versions and stuff and yeah, I think we run into edge cases quite

804
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,360
often.

805
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,360
Yeah.

806
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
Yeah.

807
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,160
And a lot of these platforms, right, they're just gonna, they're gonna solve like 80% of

808
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,640
the most common problems.

809
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Yeah.

810
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
Yeah.

811
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,640
Yeah.

812
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,640
So we'll see.

813
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,640
Fireside does have a sweet CDN.

814
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:32,960
I mean, have you noticed how fast those JB podcast download?

815
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,960
So sweet.

816
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
Right?

817
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,960
That's so sweet.

818
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:42,600
So I mean, basically the price we pay for Fireside is cheaper than if I just bought

819
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,880
the CDN access myself.

820
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,800
And with Fireside you get a whole, you know, podcasting platform.

821
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,480
But let's talk about the platforms we have been building.

822
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,480
You know, we've been rolling out our new website and you know where we do it?

823
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
On Linode.

824
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,520
We do it over at linode.com slash Jupiter.

825
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,080
You can go there to get an account with a hundred dollars just precharged for 60 days.

826
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,200
Just so awesome because it's a great way to kick the tires and really get an idea what

827
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,200
you can do with it, right?

828
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,160
Like a hundred bucks means you can really find out what the platform's capable of.

829
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,680
That is a vote of confidence on Linode's part that they know you're going to like what you

830
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,320
see when you try it out.

831
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,960
And how flexible has it been for us through this whole process?

832
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
Oh yeah.

833
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,360
Multiple team members are working in there, you know, working with infrastructure management

834
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,360
tools.

835
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:33,840
Like when I did that update on our website to add the matrix identity info, Linode's

836
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,360
just part of that chain.

837
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:40,860
I make a change on GitHub and then the actions are triggering a build on a Linode box.

838
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:45,600
And then it's serving up the website and then the cache is reframed.

839
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,960
It's like Linode is just, it's part of the whole orchestration.

840
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,000
It's so great.

841
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,880
And of course the pricing is 30 to 50% cheaper than the major hyperscalers out there that

842
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,920
want to invent their own names for everything and they want to lock you in there and just

843
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,560
keep upselling you all the time.

844
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,360
Linode has a business model that I really like.

845
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:11,560
It's built on just creating good things and then customers pay for those good things.

846
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,280
And so then they do more of what customers like.

847
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,960
That seems like a good way to go.

848
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,960
That's a crazy business model.

849
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,960
I know, right?

850
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,400
And so it means they're incentivized to do things like invest in their support department,

851
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
right?

852
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,800
Which again, the hyperscalers are not.

853
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,520
That's not their business model.

854
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,940
And so Linode's got 24-7, 365 customer support.

855
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,940
Good customer support.

856
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,040
You call up, the person that answers the phone is the person that's going to solve your problem.

857
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,360
You're not going to get transferred around a whole bunch.

858
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,640
They also really make sure they got the sharpest documentation out there and they have great

859
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,640
documentation.

860
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:45,920
I was talking to a friend recently who's brushing up on Kubernetes for a job, Linode.

861
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,380
They have great docs, great courses, eBooks, they have so many great resources.

862
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,160
And then you combine the fact that they have things like S3 compatible object storage,

863
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:00,360
cloud firewalls, physical servers if you need it, and a box that's going to meet that performance

864
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,960
to price ratio that exactly hits the sweet spot for you.

865
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,420
Maybe you need something with crazy, crazy fast drives and CPUs, they got it.

866
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,520
Maybe you want to go generate some AI images on their GPUs, they can do it.

867
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,200
Maybe you want to serve up a website.

868
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:19,380
They have a way to just dial it in just right for you without making it too complicated.

869
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,880
It's the golden ratio over there.

870
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,880
Go try it out.

871
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
See what I've been talking about.

872
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,600
And give Linode a thanks for also making our road trip possible.

873
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,040
So go to linode.com slash Jupiter.

874
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Go try them out.

875
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
Sign up.

876
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,040
New account.

877
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,040
Get $100.

878
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,320
Linode.com slash Jupiter.

879
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,360
So let's talk about that new website.

880
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,440
A lot is going on over there.

881
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,800
I have a new personal favorite feature, but I'm not sure where you want to start.

882
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,600
Oh, I think we should start there.

883
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Oh, me?

884
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Really?

885
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,600
Well, yeah.

886
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,160
You seem really excited about it.

887
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,160
Okay.

888
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,160
Well, there's a lot of great stuff we got with this new website.

889
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,880
So to say I have one favorite is not quite fair.

890
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,000
It's this week's favorite.

891
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,440
This week's favorite.

892
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,940
I've wanted to do this on the JB website for a decade.

893
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,400
And I've taken a couple of stabs at it over the years using various WordPress plugins.

894
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,820
And it was always a disaster because like not only would the plugins inevitably get

895
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:20,120
abandoned or one got like turned into adware, but also they were manual.

896
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:26,280
So like what I always wanted to do was have a banner that comes up on the site, real nice

897
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:30,160
and tacky, that says, we're live right now.

898
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,320
And if you're at your website, you're at our website, you go over to jupitabroadcasting.com.

899
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,120
It's ironic and sad to me that people could be visiting our website while we were live

900
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,840
and have no idea there's a live production going on.

901
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:49,040
Somewhere on this website, we're live recording a show right now where you can watch us and

902
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,160
you could go visit our site to get a show and have no idea it's happening.

903
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,280
And so I try these banners, these like red ribbons and like these little things that

904
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,880
show up in the corner to try to, you know, tell people we're live.

905
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,040
I tried these for years on and off.

906
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,480
And of course, I'd always forget to turn them off after the show.

907
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,320
So then I'd like do a show on a Friday and leave it up all weekend.

908
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,120
So it's like midnight on a Saturday and I'd wake up and Chris is working hard.

909
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:17,560
I wake up in the morning and get like, hey, the stream seems to be down like, oh no.

910
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:23,200
So what we have now on the new website is so outrageously great.

911
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,080
There is on the top bar, you know, our general links for like the shows, the sponsors, the

912
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,780
calendar and the live page.

913
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:39,000
And now when we are live, a tasteful little red background around the live link turns

914
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,680
on.

915
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,020
And when we turn the stream off, it turns off.

916
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,020
It's not overbearing.

917
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,480
It's not like some big banner.

918
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,880
It doesn't like reload the UI and shift it down just as you're about to click.

919
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:56,600
It's just a classy little red square behind the live link.

920
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,160
Yeah, it's super nice.

921
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,760
It's so well done.

922
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,320
And you know, as a team, internally, we've been kicking around an idea like this and

923
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,800
we were like, how would we do it when we came up with the idea?

924
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,800
I don't think did we did anybody ever suggest this approach?

925
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,560
It's so simple and yet so obvious.

926
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,560
That's what I mean.

927
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,560
The hive mind is better.

928
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,180
Yeah, it really is.

929
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,720
And now we have an effing red box behind the live link.

930
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,840
And I know it's a small thing, but when you've wanted something for a decade plus, you know,

931
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,400
it's a pretty big win.

932
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,120
And to just wake up one morning and have that.

933
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,120
Pretty great.

934
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,700
Pretty, pretty great.

935
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:33,600
And you know, Chris, this actually builds on last show's favorite.

936
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:37,600
You had a favorite feature that got implemented, which was the auto live in bed.

937
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
Yeah.

938
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:45,040
So this is actually playing off of that using peer to API in the back to just say, hey,

939
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,040
is fits live?

940
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,040
Make it red.

941
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,040
It's not live.

942
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,040
Don't make it red.

943
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,480
So peer to turns out another really sound tech investment we made this year.

944
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,480
That's true.

945
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,920
Again, it was in the effort of decentralization was the primary driver.

946
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,480
And then it turns out what we've done is we built ourselves a platform that we can now

947
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:07,160
like use the API to auto embed or to determine when we're live or not programmatically.

948
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:12,640
We never like implemented it for that, but it's so clearly, you know, we needed that.

949
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:17,440
And I, I did deploy it after talking to Alex Gates, the podcasting to the consultant.

950
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,360
I, I wanted, I wanted the plumbing there so we could live stream to the podcasting to

951
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,520
the compatible apps like pod verse.

952
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,200
So I wanted the plumbing and peer tubes, part of that plumbing.

953
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,120
But then I started, you know, there's all these other benefits like, like this, but

954
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,680
also, well, now we have our own platform.

955
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,680
Like if we ever wanted to start shooting video again, we got a platform for it.

956
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,800
That's not on YouTube.

957
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,240
And that's actually working really well.

958
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,320
We haven't had that many, if any issues with it recently.

959
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
So it's been great.

960
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Knock on wood.

961
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:52,060
So I want to say a huge thanks to deck bot for, for doing that PR and getting that feature

962
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,060
in.

963
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,840
We did a few, you know, back and forth.

964
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,840
That's the beauty of the platform.

965
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,640
And I think it turned out great.

966
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,160
I, I, I, for you, Chris really did a push to try to get that in before last week's Linux

967
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,780
unplugged and it happened.

968
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,080
So that's great.

969
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,080
So great.

970
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,480
I've always felt, I've always felt like it was so odd.

971
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,520
So disconnected that we could be live and they'd be on our website and wouldn't even

972
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:13,520
know it.

973
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,480
It's a real mess when you think about a decade of people not realizing that you're live and

974
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,480
could join us.

975
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,480
Yeah.

976
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,480
So.

977
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,480
Yeah.

978
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,480
WordPress.

979
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,480
So close.

980
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,480
So far away.

981
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,480
It's that 80% again.

982
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,400
So there's been a lot of activity going on.

983
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,360
So what, what, what is the manifestation of that?

984
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,840
Cause I see a lot of PR information going back and forth and I, when I look at the pulse

985
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,080
page, there's a lot of stuff listed here.

986
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,080
Things are getting done.

987
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,080
Yeah.

988
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:47,280
I would say from the last, uh, office hours about a fortnight ago, there have been a lot

989
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,280
of new contributors, which has been amazing.

990
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:53,880
And um, a lot of chat in the matrix room as well.

991
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:59,280
Like for instance, we've been live here for, I don't know, 30 minutes, 45 minutes on the

992
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,560
show and uh, there's like 13 new messages in the, in the website room, which is, I guess

993
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,560
I got some homework to do later.

994
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,160
Um, and that's not even our main, you know, place to chat about things.

995
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:16,360
So I wanted to do a few shout outs to some people that I think did some great stuff.

996
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:25,080
CG base player really did a lot of both opening issues and solving issues with some PRs around

997
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:31,400
even some like relatively simple to implement stuff, but just really tastefully done again,

998
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,680
which kudos to all everybody.

999
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,840
They've been doing a great job.

1000
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:39,160
So, um, CG play base player wrote a PR that I should review recently.

1001
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:44,440
Um, that's more homework about implementing some issue and PR templates.

1002
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,840
So we've just had them blank.

1003
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:54,280
You've noticed you've written a PR for, or an issue, um, and um, so they wrote some templates.

1004
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,240
One is for a feature request.

1005
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:02,880
Another is for an issue with the development environment, an issue with some episode information.

1006
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:09,880
So it's sort of customizable enough that we could tune it to, Oh yeah, it's, you know,

1007
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,600
if you have a specific episode, then is it the links, is it?

1008
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:17,520
So there's a bunch of really neat stuff we've been able to do there and it's all just implemented

1009
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,920
again in a file.

1010
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,880
So if you see an issue with the templates themselves, easy to edit, you can go edit

1011
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,720
them is really, really, really sweet.

1012
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,520
And did the same thing with simple requests.

1013
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,520
So did a little template there.

1014
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,960
So I think that's really cool stuff.

1015
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,960
So thank you CG.

1016
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:32,960
That's awesome.

1017
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,160
Should make it smoother for all the future PRs and issues.

1018
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,160
Yeah.

1019
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,920
I think that's, you know, a small usability improvement and it doesn't affect the website

1020
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:43,520
as you visit it, but it sure affects.

1021
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,520
Helps the team.

1022
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,520
Yeah.

1023
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:46,520
Yeah.

1024
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,840
All the contributors and those who might be new to GitHub and just trying to get their

1025
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,320
feet wet in that process.

1026
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,320
Definitely.

1027
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,320
Thank you.

1028
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,600
I also may have given right permissions to Elray.

1029
00:45:55,600 --> 00:46:02,000
Elray has been amazing this last few months, just working, you know, sometimes I end up,

1030
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,680
you know, quitting my working day before they do and they're in the East coast.

1031
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,680
That's crazy.

1032
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,920
And so Elray, thank you very much for all the contributions.

1033
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,640
They've been also mentoring a bunch of people through PRs with like some code contributions

1034
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:22,040
and suggestions on how to do things more Hugo style or I even, yeah, certainly got a few

1035
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,040
good lessons.

1036
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,040
So all right.

1037
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,920
Thank you for all your mentorship and seriously, and I think they're at the top of the contributors

1038
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,540
list mostly because they put in a lot of commits.

1039
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:37,160
They're very commit heavy with every detail, but, but their PRs have been some of the biggest

1040
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,160
feature changes.

1041
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,160
So huge.

1042
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,160
Thanks there.

1043
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
Yeah.

1044
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,160
Really?

1045
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,160
Especially like this is the sixth to the 13th.

1046
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,160
Look at that.

1047
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,280
I'm telling you really impressive stuff.

1048
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,280
Yeah.

1049
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,280
They also have a day job apparently.

1050
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,280
I'm not sure.

1051
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:49,280
That's true.

1052
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,800
They also pumping out a ton from Poland.

1053
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:54,800
Yeah.

1054
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,680
I, I've been super impressed.

1055
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,180
Many people have contributed many amazing things and I, my human memory is not good

1056
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:03,760
enough to name them all, but I just want to a blanket.

1057
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,760
Thank you to everyone.

1058
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,080
It's been a super exciting last two weeks.

1059
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,920
It really, it's been, it's been amazing.

1060
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,760
I think this is just one of the most amazing community efforts we've ever seen for JB.

1061
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,960
I think Chase did some amazing stuff too around design work and fixing some like layout issues

1062
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,960
and things like that.

1063
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,320
I also want to give a huge shout out to Mitch from Podverse.

1064
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:25,880
They actually, I guess, gave us a shout out and wrote the following.

1065
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:30,120
By the way, whenever someone jumps in and makes a technical contribution to Podverse,

1066
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:34,240
they pretty much always say that they found out about Podverse from JB.

1067
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,240
That's great.

1068
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,240
Isn't that nice?

1069
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,240
Yeah.

1070
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:38,720
It sounds like some of the better contributions they've had recently have been coming from

1071
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,520
JB audience members.

1072
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,480
And so thank you for letting them know because that got passed on to us.

1073
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,480
Yeah.

1074
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,480
That's very sweet.

1075
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,840
We don't really hear the signal that that kind of stuff happens.

1076
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:53,280
So whenever we do get to hear that, that's really sweet.

1077
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,200
And now it is time for the boost.

1078
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,000
Our baller this week also boosted again while we were live.

1079
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,640
GeneBean came in with a set of LeetSats.

1080
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,040
I decided to watch part of the show live today and realized it'd be nice if there was a way

1081
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:11,040
to use Alby from jupyter.tube to boost.

1082
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,680
What I decided to do was fall back to the Podverse web version and send in a live boost

1083
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,680
during the show.

1084
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:17,680
Just a thought.

1085
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:18,680
Yeah.

1086
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,680
I'm watching Alex Gates.

1087
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:25,400
He's been modifying the no agenda tube for podcasting 2.0 features, and I think they're

1088
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,800
working out some boost stuff.

1089
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,720
I think there's something to that.

1090
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,960
I don't think it's urgent, but I think there's something to it because running a PeerTube

1091
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,920
instance is pretty expensive.

1092
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:42,840
And so I could see some communities out there wanting to kind of incentivize content, incentivize

1093
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:47,900
good content, and then maybe the hosting platforms in a split with the creator.

1094
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:48,900
Something like that.

1095
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:49,900
I don't know.

1096
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:50,900
Yeah.

1097
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,400
I don't know exactly where it's going to go, but I feel like it's got some legs.

1098
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:58,820
Well, and I think to facilitate that feature, we've been talking about also integrating

1099
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,920
a way to boost on our website on the live page where you get the PeerTube embed.

1100
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,920
Yeah.

1101
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,120
I think that's a nice to have feature at this point.

1102
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,760
It's not very, very high on the priority list, but that would be a nice date when that comes

1103
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,760
as well.

1104
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,040
I am glad Podverse does allow for some web boosting.

1105
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,280
We got a row of ducks from Tac751.

1106
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,520
He says, I love the new website.

1107
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,520
Great work.

1108
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:25,440
I have a question for you guys.

1109
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:31,120
Have you thought about starting a matrix voice chat bridged to mumble?

1110
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:36,360
The reason I'm thinking is I'm forced to use an iOS device to interact with you live.

1111
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,720
It's mostly the only device I have available with a microphone and voice isolation good

1112
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,000
enough for participation.

1113
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,360
However, the mumble situation on iOS is no good.

1114
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:47,480
Yeah, I don't love the mumble options.

1115
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,640
There are a couple of third party mumble options, but none of them are really great.

1116
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,960
A matrix room bridged to mumble.

1117
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:54,960
Have we thought about that?

1118
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,960
No, I don't think so.

1119
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:57,240
No, not really.

1120
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,120
Mostly because I don't want to encourage people to leave mumble.

1121
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:05,600
I really like our mumble community, and I think it's such a great tool for this kind

1122
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,600
of thing.

1123
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:09,020
It's just one of those that's ahead of its time, right?

1124
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:13,320
When you see how popular clubhouse and Twitter spaces have become in Discord rooms, there's

1125
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,400
clearly audience demand or customer demand or whatever for that kind of thing.

1126
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,060
But I think bumble was maybe a little soon, a little early, but it's the best still.

1127
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:24,920
So I really want people to join our mumble room.

1128
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:26,420
I really think it's a great tool.

1129
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,600
Maybe I'm an old guy.

1130
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,720
Maybe I should consider it.

1131
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,540
We'll give it a little time and see.

1132
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,960
We haven't yet deployed any bridges.

1133
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:35,960
That's true.

1134
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,960
On purpose.

1135
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,960
Yeah.

1136
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,060
The other thing I think is worth considering, Chris, is that the last time we tried to use

1137
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:45,720
the voice stuff in matrix, which was several months ago, it didn't quite work out so well

1138
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:46,720
for us.

1139
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,240
So I don't think we have much information on the state of things around there.

1140
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,720
So it would need a lot more testing for us to rely on it.

1141
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,720
Yeah, we would probably need.

1142
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:54,720
Yeah, you're right.

1143
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,720
I think it's gotten better.

1144
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,560
I know they've been working on that, but yeah, just about everything has.

1145
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,480
So Dylan boosted in with three thousand five hundred stats.

1146
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,440
This is now with the Hugo deployment out of the way.

1147
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,880
Any plans for a Jupiter broadcasting form?

1148
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,600
I wonder how in the loop you are with free and open source form software.

1149
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,600
Do you have a favorite?

1150
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:20,180
I myself am currently getting ready to set up Flarem, F-L-A-R-U-M, for my own community.

1151
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:24,920
I would love to hear more about that, Dylan, if you or Dylan, if you have any experience

1152
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:29,760
with it or how your users respond to that.

1153
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,160
You're probably not surprised to hear me say I'm not super interested in a form.

1154
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,640
We used to have a very large form.

1155
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:44,280
That's how we actually came on to Scale Engines Radar, who was our original host, was because

1156
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,200
the hosting provider we had at the time was like, you got to get out of here.

1157
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,360
Your website's taken way too much traffic, too many resources, you got to get out of

1158
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,360
here.

1159
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,680
And so we're like, OK, OK, we don't know where to go.

1160
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,840
And now it's like, well, I'll help you.

1161
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,680
And he helped us migrate to Scale Engine.

1162
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,000
And it remained popular for a while, but then it kind of faded, and then we set up some

1163
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:08,240
other ones over the years, different platforms, Discourse, Vee, Bulletin, PHP, BBB, and other

1164
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,800
ones, just kind of playing around with them.

1165
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:15,920
And I think it just feels like the world's kind of moved more towards real-time communication,

1166
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:23,320
although clearly there are, for certain projects, it's nice to have Git Hubs with, you know,

1167
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,040
asynchronous communication.

1168
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,040
Asynchronous communication.

1169
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,840
So there are times where it works.

1170
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:32,280
It just feels like we already have too many platforms and too many options, and we're

1171
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:36,240
finally kind of consolidating around Boost and Matrix and Telegram.

1172
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:41,280
Well, I do feel like Matrix with all of its subdivisions, you know, all the different

1173
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,280
rooms and the topics.

1174
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,520
Yeah, they're kind of like sub-forums.

1175
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,880
It's pretty much a forum, if you look at it that way, the way we have it set up.

1176
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,400
And so I would say, if you haven't spent that much time there, go there for sure.

1177
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:55,840
I hope it has some of the same feel, but to get some of this stuff live, too, and all

1178
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,440
the features that it has, I think it's been actually really pleasantly amazing.

1179
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,440
Yeah, yeah.

1180
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,760
It feels like that's the way to go now.

1181
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,760
Yeah.

1182
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,760
I agree.

1183
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,760
I'd be curious to know what they think.

1184
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,040
And we've tried to break the subjects up quite a bit, so no one particular room is going

1185
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,040
crazy.

1186
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,280
Like, I can pretty much stay up to date on all the rooms without it feeling like a burden.

1187
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,280
Look at you.

1188
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,280
I know.

1189
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:16,280
I dedicate a monitor to it.

1190
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,440
Where I remember before Matrix, you were feeling pretty overwhelmed.

1191
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,760
Oh, I still struggle with the Telegram room.

1192
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,680
I can only just kind of jump in there a few times a day, and I can't really stay up to

1193
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,680
date on all of it.

1194
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,680
Or same with Twitter.

1195
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,960
Just when it's one flat stream, it just doesn't work for me, because that's just not what

1196
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,960
I'm doing all day.

1197
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,480
Sergeant Apple boosted in with a row of ducks.

1198
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,480
Thank you kindly.

1199
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,120
He just simply said, congrats on the new website.

1200
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:43,040
We got a lot of congratulations on the new website, so thank you, everybody.

1201
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,760
Rusticaster Versa boosted in with a thousand sats.

1202
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,400
I sat around for four minutes of dead air waiting for a secret bonus at the end, like

1203
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,120
of a Marvel movie of last week's episode.

1204
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,120
Oh, no.

1205
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,240
You guys got me.

1206
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,120
But great job on the new website.

1207
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,560
It's so awesome and cool that the community's involved.

1208
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,560
Cheers, everybody.

1209
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,720
Yeah, I think that was just an export mistake.

1210
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,280
That's another thing we broke.

1211
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,280
Oops, sorry.

1212
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,280
Yeah.

1213
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,200
And Drew kindly snipped and republished, but if you download one of the early versions

1214
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,560
of the show, you got a little extra dead air at the end.

1215
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:16,220
You know, I think we probably deserve to put in some little special feature at some point.

1216
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:17,220
We should have.

1217
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:20,560
Well, you know, most weeks will not every time, but a lot of times we'll have something

1218
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:23,600
in the post show, usually not with office hours, but every now and then.

1219
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:27,600
So it you know, I would not be it would not be unusual to expect it.

1220
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,640
But never like a secret song from a 90s CD, you know, where you got to like 90 songs to

1221
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,000
get such a thing.

1222
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,440
That was such a thing.

1223
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,440
Wow.

1224
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:47,960
So GeneBean is technically a double booster this week with another set of LeetSats.

1225
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:53,480
And I need to spend time with Albie because maybe GeneBean, you can be our Albie correspondent.

1226
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,480
Anybody else out there that's using Albie, he's looking for ways to generate an invoice

1227
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:02,800
on mobile so he can essentially use Strike on mobile and top off his Albie wallet.

1228
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:07,360
He says, I've only found out how to do this via the desktop web extension, but he'd like

1229
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,960
a way to do it completely on mobile.

1230
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:09,960
Right.

1231
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,160
The way I would think you'd do it right was you would you'd probably have your mobile

1232
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,120
phone and the desktop extension up and kind of do it at the same time, but it would be

1233
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:17,840
nice to do it all when you're out and about.

1234
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:20,960
I think sometimes that's the problem with some of these like QR methods.

1235
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,040
And I'm not saying that's the case here, but I've seen that sometimes when they implement

1236
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,240
like a QR code scanning method of getting an invoice in or something.

1237
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,960
Well, you kind of necessarily need two devices for that.

1238
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,840
I think we got to spend time with Albie.

1239
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:36,360
I have it installed and I've used it a little bit because I use it for my boosting with

1240
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:40,600
Podverse, but I haven't really like lived with it.

1241
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,920
But I think it's worth that time and investment.

1242
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:48,960
Proximity sent in their very first boost, just 25 SATs, but they're a new Linux user

1243
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,480
who started listening a couple of years ago when the lockdowns happened.

1244
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,880
They started listening to our podcast, which is great because I heard a lot of people that

1245
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:56,880
stopped listening.

1246
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,880
It's true.

1247
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:58,880
Changing habit.

1248
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,680
But I'm curious what you think about this.

1249
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,520
We haven't talked about this much at all.

1250
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,960
He says, I think the idea of Fountain where you earn SATs while you listen is great for

1251
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,960
the podcast economy.

1252
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,520
So here's a small token as my first boost ever.

1253
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:20,200
So in Fountain, the way this works is they now let podcasters promote clips or an episode

1254
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:26,200
and you pay like a thousand or two thousand SATs or 10,000 SATs to have your show promoted.

1255
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:32,880
And in Fountain, the homepage, if you will, of the app when you launch it is a Discover page.

1256
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,640
At the top, it'll have two promoted clips and then I'll have about like six community

1257
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:43,180
source clips and some of the most popular community clips will be featured on this page.

1258
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,440
And then on the second page is all your podcasts.

1259
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:52,280
And so when you listen to a podcast or you listen to a promoted clip, you get streamed

1260
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:59,280
SATs and those SATs are taken from the promotion when people bought promoted spots on Fountain.

1261
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:04,520
So you can earn SATs as you listen, as you know, I've earned like 55,000 SATs and we

1262
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:07,640
get a lot of people who boost in just from the SATs they earn.

1263
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:12,000
I'm curious, does it seem gimmicky to you or does it seem like a legit system?

1264
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,080
Because it's the only podcast app that's doing this.

1265
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:20,840
But the idea is sort of like, so on that road trip, you're driving for 11 hours.

1266
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,480
If you listened to podcasts the entire time with Fountain and you were in good flow, which

1267
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:29,980
is when you've been listening to making clips, you might have been able to earn a chunk of

1268
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,980
change there.

1269
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,280
Although don't clip and drive people.

1270
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,400
Yeah, don't clip and drive.

1271
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,280
What are your thoughts, scammy or the future?

1272
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,280
When this first came out, I was actually quite worried.

1273
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,680
I thought, oh, Fountain has been doing good things and now all of a sudden they have this

1274
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,000
system that can potentially really ruin what they've been doing.

1275
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,420
Things can get weird when money gets involved.

1276
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:48,960
But I think it's in their implementation.

1277
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,600
It sounds like, you know, even you mentioned when you first bring it up, it has two featured

1278
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,140
clips and then the rest are community clips.

1279
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:59,680
I think that's actually a really nice balance because you're not just inundated with, you

1280
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,800
know, they're all promoted clips, right?

1281
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,560
It's like, oh, I don't actually, there's not that much value in all this because someone

1282
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,880
just bought their way in.

1283
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,840
But to have a mix between the two, I think that's actually a really nice balance.

1284
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:19,200
So the community, you know, has their stuff that's promoted just through meritocracy,

1285
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,200
I guess.

1286
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,200
Yeah.

1287
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,400
You know, when I first started using Fountain and I saw the clips, I was like, oh, get these.

1288
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,440
I want my podcast as my default screen.

1289
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,640
Get these clips out of here.

1290
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,760
Now like months into it, there's a couple of things I like a lot about it.

1291
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,680
A. I now, like if I just want to, if I'm just doing something for a few minutes, like maybe

1292
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,960
I'm tidying the kitchen and I want to kill five minutes.

1293
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:45,520
I used to go to YouTube and I'd watch something that's probably like junk food for the mind

1294
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,960
on YouTube while I was doing a short task, right?

1295
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:55,560
But now I open up Fountain and I just play a podcast clip and it's almost always better

1296
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:58,160
because you're right, it's not an algorithm that's picked it.

1297
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,280
It's the popularity in the Fountain community that's brought to the top.

1298
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:08,680
And through that process, I think I've added three, maybe four podcasts that I listened

1299
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:13,600
to on the regular now as a result that I never, and so it's like now I have podcasts that

1300
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,960
are only in Fountain and I'm like, I've got some in Podverse and I've got some in Fountain.

1301
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,960
It's a bit of a mess, but I really like their clip discovery and I started as a skeptic

1302
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,920
and I like the SAT streaming system because it's just one more like, well, this podcast

1303
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:34,180
is on YouTube, but it's also in Fountain and I could earn some SATs if I listen in Fountain.

1304
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:37,040
So I'll just listen in Fountain and I think that's better.

1305
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:42,840
I think for the content creator, it's better if I listen in Fountain and I think for me,

1306
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,600
because of the YouTube ecosystem and how it just keeps sending you down a rabbit hole,

1307
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:50,520
I think it's better for me if I listen in Fountain and I earn SATs at the same time.

1308
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:56,040
Another thing is that like proximity here, if you're not fully into the whole Bitcoin

1309
00:59:56,040 --> 01:00:00,940
thing and getting your own SATs and you don't want to jump through all those hoots to just

1310
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:05,560
start playing with this, the SAT streaming is actually a really nice way to just kind

1311
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,240
of get your toe wet.

1312
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:08,240
Yeah.

1313
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,040
And you know, for 25 SATs, he just kicked off this whole conversation we just had.

1314
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,280
That's the great thing about the boost.

1315
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,520
It's not really about the value so much.

1316
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,440
It's about whatever it is to you, right?

1317
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,720
Those are his first 25 SATs he's ever earned.

1318
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,000
Well, that's a lot to him, right?

1319
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,440
It's what is the value of the show to you?

1320
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,880
So thank you, proximity.

1321
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:30,560
We got a boost from GLT Gordon, 2000 SATs.

1322
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,600
Took your advice to use Fountain to gain some SATs.

1323
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,360
The UK banks are not allowing me to buy Bitcoin.

1324
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,480
There's another reason why you might want to earn SATs.

1325
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:41,340
So what you got to do, JL, is you got to optimize your flow mode.

1326
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:44,600
If you go into the overflow menu, the hamburger menu in Fountain, it'll give you what your

1327
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,840
flow status is.

1328
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,300
The higher your flow, the higher your earn rate.

1329
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:53,200
You get more flow by listening to clips, by liking clips, by making clips, and by boosting

1330
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,200
shows.

1331
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,880
The more you do that, your flow meter goes up.

1332
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:00,240
Oh, and the big one, the biggest thing you can do is recommend people, like give them

1333
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,240
your link.

1334
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,240
Referral link.

1335
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,240
Yeah, referral link.

1336
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:07,280
And if you get five people, you get like a 5x flow rate.

1337
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,440
And some people, I think it might have been in the Bitcoin chatting matrix room, were

1338
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:17,600
suggesting, yeah, if people want to throw in their referral links in there, people use

1339
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,600
them.

1340
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,320
So there's a bit of a community happening here, too.

1341
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,320
There you go.

1342
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:26,280
I just, I think it's, what I am seeing as a podcaster is a lot of those SATs are coming

1343
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,280
back to the podcasters.

1344
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,280
Nice.

1345
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,280
Right?

1346
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,280
Because you could just cash them out.

1347
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,280
Oh, right, of course.

1348
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,360
And then people are turning around and using them to boost.

1349
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:38,840
So it is, it's the listeners are earning, and then they're reinvesting it into the podcast.

1350
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,640
There's value in the ecosystem.

1351
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:41,640
Right.

1352
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:42,840
Very interesting system.

1353
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,760
So I'm, I like you was the first, it was a little trepidatious, I'm like, yeah, you add

1354
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,320
money to anything and it can get weird.

1355
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,320
Oh, yeah.

1356
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:52,300
Having now seen it, and seeing their updates, they've done a couple of app updates since

1357
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,160
they've implemented it, and they've kind of made it smoother and easier to see where you're

1358
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:58,560
at, clear what's going on.

1359
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,720
So I think they've done a good job on the implementation.

1360
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:03,000
So you feel pretty satisfied now?

1361
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,520
That's good.

1362
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,320
Somebody should bang suggest that.

1363
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:13,960
JLT also sent another 3500 SATs just to say, hey, we got also 50 SATs from a young dookie

1364
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,080
who said, I'm still having trouble finding the show.

1365
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,200
But usually if I find a clip of the show, then I can find the show from there.

1366
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,200
Wow.

1367
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,200
Yeah.

1368
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:29,640
Yeah, I think we might rename the show after the trip or towards maybe around the holidays,

1369
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,640
might be time for a show.

1370
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:34,760
I think if we were the only podcast on the planet, maybe it'd be a good name.

1371
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,760
Yeah.

1372
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,080
I would imagine it's been used a lot.

1373
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:42,600
And a lot of podcasts that use the name Office Hours are podcasts about the show, The Office,

1374
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,080
the US edition of The Office.

1375
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,080
Oh, of course.

1376
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,080
Yeah.

1377
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,080
I don't know.

1378
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,080
So we'll have to get some ideas.

1379
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,080
Yeah, we're open to suggestions.

1380
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,080
Yeah.

1381
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:54,400
So you're right, a young dookie, it is a pain in the butt.

1382
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,120
And if you don't get the right one, it's like maybe doesn't have the boost feed and all

1383
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,120
that too.

1384
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:02,480
So we'll have to work on that, but he does say, regardless, great work, everyone on the

1385
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,480
new website.

1386
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,880
Oh, bonus point.

1387
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:05,880
We got a lot.

1388
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,880
We got a lot this week.

1389
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,400
I wasn't going to necessarily put them all in because we're kind of being selective about

1390
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:15,120
the boost we include now, but we do read all of them and we got a lot of compliments on

1391
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,120
the new website.

1392
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,760
So that was really nice to see.

1393
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,760
Thank you, everyone.

1394
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,760
You can go grab a new podcast app, a new podcast apps.com.

1395
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,960
I love Podverse because it's built into our website, but it's GPL.

1396
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,960
It's available for Android, iOS.

1397
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:30,640
It's on F-Droid and they're constantly making it better.

1398
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:35,440
We're going to have Mitch on the show in a few weeks to kind of talk about it, but now

1399
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,440
we're going to hit the road.

1400
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,120
I don't know if we'll be live next week or in two weeks.

1401
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,360
All our shows are weekly except for self-hosted.

1402
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,360
Where are we going to be in two weeks?

1403
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,040
Let's see.

1404
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,640
Will we be all the way down in Pasadena?

1405
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:48,920
I think it's a Pasadena.

1406
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:53,880
I think the next office hours actually falls on the day we're supposed to drive down to

1407
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:54,880
Pasadena to the Airbnb.

1408
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:55,880
Yeah.

1409
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:56,880
It's on the 27th.

1410
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:57,880
Yeah.

1411
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:00,720
The reason why I'm not sure if we're going to be live is because you and I might just

1412
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:05,560
wake up super early, record an off-air show and then hit the road.

1413
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:06,560
That's the safer option.

1414
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:07,560
It sounds like.

1415
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:08,560
Yeah.

1416
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:09,560
That's what I think we're going to do.

1417
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:10,560
Okay.

1418
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,560
We'll see.

1419
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,560
We'll see.

1420
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:13,560
I don't really know because who knows?

1421
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,560
Right?

1422
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,560
I'm not even really sure where we're going to be.

1423
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:20,600
This is where it gets fun, but I think we got all the right gear on board JOOPS.

1424
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,600
There's a couple of things I had to pick up.

1425
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,640
We've got a new Zoom field recorder, so all the XLR ports are working.

1426
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:28,480
We should probably take it out of the box and put batteries in it and try it.

1427
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,480
Yeah.

1428
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,480
I got a Elgato Stream Deck for switching.

1429
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,480
Wow.

1430
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,480
Really?

1431
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,480
Because I only have one monitor when I'm on the road.

1432
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:37,480
That's nice.

1433
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,080
Here, I've got one, two, three, four, five screens.

1434
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:44,120
I go from having five screens to do the show to having one screen.

1435
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:48,960
I thought, yeah, the Stream Deck is probably a good way to go.

1436
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:53,800
Just get some basic functionality up on there and take some of that stuff off from clicking.

1437
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,480
Got to kind of get all that wired up.

1438
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,640
Still a little bit of work to do on that, but we've got a few days because we're going

1439
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,200
to record Linux unplugged in studio.

1440
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:07,800
We're doing a double this week, and then Coder on Monday morning, and then we're hitting

1441
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,800
the road.

1442
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,800
Then we're out of here.

1443
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,800
We're driving for 10 hours.

1444
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,800
Yeah.

1445
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,800
I'm used to that by now.

1446
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,800
All right.

1447
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,800
Well, that's it then.

1448
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:15,800
It's time to get out of here.

1449
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,560
Thanks for joining us, everybody.

1450
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,560
Office hours are over.

1451
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,560
We got to tidy up and pack.

1452
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:22,560
We got to get out of here.

1453
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:23,560
Thanks for joining us.

1454
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,560
We'll see you next week.

1455
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:53,560
Bye-bye.
