1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,900
It's Office Hours with Chris.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,540
Hi everyone.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,340
Welcome into Office Hours.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,700
Today in the office, Brent's joining me.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:14,700
Hello Brent.

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,700
Well, hello there.

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,700
Hi.

8
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,700
Hey.

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,700
You doing all right over there?

10
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,700
Yeah.

11
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,700
I'm not in my own office.

12
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,620
I'm sitting in Alex's office, but I imagine you're in yours.

13
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,540
We're virtually together in one office, the office of the Editor-in-Chief of Jupiter Broadcasting.

14
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,360
It's a new test show.

15
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,480
We're going to do it every other Tuesday, starting next week.

16
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,780
This is a test of a new test show.

17
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,300
We're trying out things like matrix integration.

18
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,760
We're going to be experimenting with things for future podcasts.

19
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,600
And of course, we're going to be covering things that are going on in the world of Jupiter

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,940
Broadcasting because we have a summer of projects coming up.

21
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,460
We've got a new meetup in the works already.

22
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,460
All that kind of stuff.

23
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,460
And also, we have some goals that we'd like to share with you.

24
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,780
There's a whole bunch going on.

25
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,780
You know, it's like a new day, Brent.

26
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,040
The theme is possibilities today, which is a good day to do a test show.

27
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,180
Sounds like you're feeling great today.

28
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,180
This is...

29
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,180
I'm excited.

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,100
I started, actually, I have to be honest, trending very negative.

31
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,340
And I thought it was going to be a real crapper of a day.

32
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,060
What kicked you into that mood to start with?

33
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:16,020
Well, I got RV problems again.

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,020
Oh, no.

35
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,020
Yeah.

36
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,020
It's the damn slide again.

37
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,700
So short version, as you're aware, is one side of our slide got some water damage.

38
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,700
And so it caused the slide to sag a little bit.

39
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,020
And then this thing gets retracted into the RV, and it's being drug along the floor.

40
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,740
So the motors, which are not really sufficient to begin with, are working much harder.

41
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,660
And when it rains, we've been pulling the slide in because it's leaking where it sags.

42
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,700
And it's been raining a lot this winter.

43
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,800
And so we've been pulling the slide in and out a lot this winter, and we have burned

44
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,800
out the motors now.

45
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,120
And I'm not even sure if I'll be able to get the slide in.

46
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,500
And of course, I wanted to go on this camping trip with Dylan for his birthday at the end

47
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,860
of the month.

48
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,980
And we call around to all the shops, and we're lucky if they even call us back.

49
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:06,900
We walked into one place, and they told us that they're booked out until September.

50
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,500
RV season hasn't even really started yet.

51
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,500
That's what I said.

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,400
And he said, no, it doesn't end anymore.

53
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
It never ends.

54
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,220
Sounds like a business opportunity to me.

55
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,980
Chris's RV shop.

56
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,980
I know.

57
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,980
I wish.

58
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,820
I decided to actually drive around this morning before I came in and did the show today because

59
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,860
I figured maybe I'd have a better result in person because I was getting nowhere on the

60
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,860
phone.

61
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,740
You know, I've worked with enough of these shops that you can kind of get an impression

62
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:38,100
on how they run their schedule, how organized or chaotic the shop is just by kind of going

63
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,860
in and talking to them.

64
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,140
And that's a big factor when you're trying to get your homework done is how organized

65
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,140
are they?

66
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,580
Some of them are pretty bad.

67
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,540
We went into our shop that we used to go to all the time.

68
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,000
We loved them, but then their text left.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,540
And we thought, OK, we got to find a new place because we know this is important stuff.

70
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,340
Well, we went back in there this morning.

71
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,340
We walk in and they said, sorry, we can't see it till June, mid-June.

72
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,340
Thanks anyways.

73
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,340
We're going to keep looking.

74
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,140
So we walk out and my wife, the assistant, she says, you know, I'm going to go back in

75
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,860
there and just ask them, well, who the hell do they recommend that because there's nowhere

76
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,860
we can go.

77
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,860
Right.

78
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,860
Like, who should we go talk to?

79
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,180
So she turns around and goes back in and she bumps into the old text that used to be great

80
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,180
that left.

81
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,740
They'd come back.

82
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,820
And one of them is the owner.

83
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,980
He'd come back and they're great.

84
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,980
And he worked with it.

85
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,540
He's like, you know, well, I'll find something for you right now.

86
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,540
He pulls out the schedule.

87
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,020
He starts going through everything.

88
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,980
He's like, we have three hours here and we have six hours here.

89
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,080
If you can drop your rig off for two days and let us work over two days, we'll get it

90
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,860
fixed for you and get you on the road before your camping trip with your son.

91
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,860
Wow.

92
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,300
And it's just one of those like she just bumped into them on the way back and like and then

93
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,300
I walked out.

94
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,300
I'm like, OK, that's awesome.

95
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,380
I'm going to call this other shop who I was considering for the other work we need done

96
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,940
. And sure enough, it's not as it's not as soon as I'd like, but they're going to get

97
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,680
us into they're going to work with us.

98
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,800
They're going to fix up something that's been a problem for a while.

99
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,740
It's like all of a sudden we went from not being able to get any help.

100
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,660
I got a couple of shops I'm working with again.

101
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,060
We're going to have things up and going, which is good because we're already planning a J.B.

102
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,340
road trip for this summer or maybe fall.

103
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,900
She's got to be road ready, you know, we need jupes in perfect condition.

104
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,900
That's for sure.

105
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,660
I have an idea about maybe going to visiting a mutual friend and doing some meetups along

106
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,660
the way.

107
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,260
You know, three or four meetups along the way.

108
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,300
Is it intentionally cryptic or am I supposed to guess or?

109
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,820
Well, I haven't coordinated it with them yet, but they've offered and it's something that

110
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,820
I think would be special and exclusive.

111
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,540
I think you probably know what I'm talking about, probably.

112
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,380
I think you've had brunch with this person.

113
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,220
But anyways, I've had brunch with like a lot of people.

114
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:50,820
I know which we should say why we have people's ear brunch isn't necessarily gone.

115
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
It's just it's actually in the kitchen right now.

116
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,260
So might come out in due time.

117
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,260
Yeah, I suppose.

118
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,780
And when it does, this would be one of the places we talk about it because that's sort

119
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,980
of the general premise of the show is we get a lot of emails, we get a lot of boosts that

120
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,100
come in and we get a lot of questions that come in and we don't necessarily get a chance

121
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,260
to talk about them on air or there's a lot of initiatives that Jupiter Broadcasting

122
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,500
is working on.

123
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Maybe some projects, some web projects and stuff like that that people might want to

124
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,620
help us out with or get involved with.

125
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,900
And it just doesn't really make sense to take up the other shows with that stuff.

126
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,620
I mean, we can mention it, but we don't want to take up the other shows.

127
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,020
I also feel like if we keep this trend going, this might be the place where you get like

128
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,380
the early take on what's coming up.

129
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,020
So could be could be.

130
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,860
We got an email in to the show.

131
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,420
I can say that now.

132
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,740
It was a listener who sent in like the perfect hardware for Lady Jubes.

133
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,420
It's an experiment he did for a Proxmox box last summer, but he says it's just going to

134
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,580
be perfect for Jupes.

135
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,220
It's low power, 10 watts and just this nice little Intel box.

136
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,500
And I just love this about our audience, Brent.

137
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,740
He's listening to my problems.

138
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,620
He's like, I found the perfect hardware for you and he sends me all the links, all the

139
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:05,540
specs that he used, the software stack, you know, like it's it's like a basically a blueprint.

140
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,620
It's so great.

141
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,660
So that's the kind of stuff that you only get here as this part of this community.

142
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,900
And Joshua touched on that, too.

143
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,820
He says it was great to meet everyone singing Happy Birthday to Wes and having cake while

144
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,740
meeting you all and all the other great people in JB was really memorable.

145
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,220
I hope to see some of you all again itself.

146
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,420
I can't really say how awesome it is to meet everyone in person.

147
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,420
Well, that's pretty great.

148
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,580
That came from Joshua.

149
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,540
He says, I loved geeking out with Hadia about growing plants.

150
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:39,900
I feel like it's important also to say that these meetups are equally memorable for us.

151
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,460
Like we were just as excited to go meet everyone else.

152
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,300
And the conversations we had there as well were super memorable and really excited, exciting.

153
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,900
And I'm still doing research based on some of those conversations.

154
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,220
So it's two sided.

155
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,100
And thank you for everyone who did show up.

156
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,540
I think maybe one of the long term knock on effects of this Raleigh meetup might be that

157
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:06,340
JB as a as a business or as a group or whatever you want to call it, kind of get serious about

158
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:12,180
helping the community self-organized meetups, because I don't think we the meetup was less

159
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,520
than 24 hours old where somebody was saying, hey, let's do another one, even if the host

160
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,760
can't make it.

161
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,260
Maybe some of us just want to get together.

162
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,260
Yeah, that's great.

163
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,060
I've seen other podcasts pull that off.

164
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,740
I feel like it's another excuse to have a lug, JB inspired lug.

165
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,260
And you and I can, you know, we can all just sort of show up whenever it fits.

166
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:34,660
I also kind of wonder if maybe it isn't going to be more important as time goes on because

167
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,260
things are just the world's wild these days.

168
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:43,020
And so how nice is it to go somewhere where people kind of speak a common like language

169
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,060
about something they're enthusiastic about?

170
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,740
You could just talk to anybody about Linux and the whole technology stack.

171
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,340
So you immediately have something to talk to people about.

172
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,720
Plus you have like the hey, where are you from?

173
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,940
And so even for people who are not like expert conversationalists, it's really easy to just

174
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,340
kind of get yourself comfortable and start talking.

175
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:04,820
That's that kind of awkwardness fades away for a lot of it.

176
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,740
And it's easy for me to say because I've been to dozens and hundreds of them, I suppose,

177
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,620
but it's pretty good.

178
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,900
And so I think helping the community do that could be good for people's mental health.

179
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,900
It's good for ours.

180
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,460
So I think, yeah, we'd love to help as much as we can.

181
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,500
Last email from my Frederick.

182
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,980
It's time to sunset IRC from the website.

183
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,020
It's definitely time.

184
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,900
And continue the embracing of matrix.

185
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,900
Long words.

186
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,140
How does that sit with you, Chris?

187
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,740
Well, I'm wondering how you feel about this, because I don't think you're a big element

188
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,740
fan.

189
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,780
I don't think you're really necessarily sold on the matrix thing.

190
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,400
I think I'm sold on the idea.

191
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,780
And I'm sold on, I think everyone's enthusiasm, because as far as ideals go, I'm enthusiastic,

192
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,660
but implementation, I'm having a difficult time with.

193
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,620
And I don't think it's only me, but let me know what you think.

194
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,660
And it could be the fact that I'm running slightly older hardware that, you know, maybe

195
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:07,140
on some more recent hardware, some of the issues I'm running into, part of which, for

196
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,060
the most part, is performance.

197
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,260
Maybe you don't even notice on a modern machine, but this X250 that I have here, just, it's

198
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,300
fine for everything else I do, but it just like, you know, you start running a few of

199
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:23,460
these apps, but Element especially, and it's just like, it was running like 80% CPU for

200
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,440
no apparent reason for a long, long, long, long, long time.

201
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,420
Maybe it's early days for the software or something.

202
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:36,100
I'm trying to be positive here, but I just had some, yeah, some issues that if it wasn't

203
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,700
matrix, I would just give up on that piece of software and not participate anymore.

204
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,380
I did look at a few other clients.

205
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,080
I think it's still early days.

206
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,060
Many of them are in like alpha stages or beta stages and have bugs and things, but there

207
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,560
are some great ones with great features.

208
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,340
So I'm trying, I'm trying.

209
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,580
You suggested maybe the web interface might be a thing for me to try and I haven't done

210
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,580
that yet.

211
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,900
So there's an opportunity.

212
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,500
NeoChat might ultimately be a better option for, there's going to be, like you just said,

213
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,940
there's going to be clients that will be perhaps more power efficient and processor efficient.

214
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,940
This is the downside of using Electron as the base for Element.

215
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,540
Just by nature, it's extremely power hungry and system intensive, unfortunately.

216
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,740
And I'll add to this, you know, it is absolutely early days.

217
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:26,460
I have a problem right now that I cannot respond to any PMs.

218
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,460
Don't know why.

219
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,780
I suspect one of my sessions isn't properly verified, but I can use all the tools to verify

220
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,480
my sessions and I've logged out everything that doesn't look like it's right and everything

221
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
looks good, right?

222
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,560
Like I've diagnosed it, everything seems fine, yet I can't respond to any PMs.

223
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,720
That's frustrating, you know, and I have weird quirks about just how it all works from a

224
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,100
client side standpoint and how it, how it retrieves its information from the server.

225
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,980
And of course, there's a whole, there's a whole conversation around how the state of

226
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,980
the Synapse server.

227
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,500
So it is very early days, but you know, my thought here is twofold.

228
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,540
The audience that's likely to participate in these kinds of things are generally, you

229
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,380
know, the early adopter crowd.

230
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,020
The vast majority of the audience doesn't participate in any of this stuff, right?

231
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,100
I mean, 99% of the audience isn't in the Telegram group, probably more than that, right?

232
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,820
98% of the audience never emails in.

233
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,280
It's the leading edge of the community that even use this stuff to begin with.

234
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,980
And so they're probably in the early adopter category.

235
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,220
And my other thought there is, well, then, okay, if we don't use this stuff as early

236
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,020
adopters, who will?

237
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:39,140
So if we don't, as a user base, put our eyes on this and find the problems and as a collective

238
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:44,620
create demand, so that way the developers continue, this kind of stuff goes away.

239
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,340
And things like Discord reign supreme.

240
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,340
And so my thought was that those two things, like, well, we've got an early adopter audience.

241
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:55,180
I mean, hell, they're using the Linux desktop a lot of cases or something, right?

242
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,820
And if we don't do it, who will?

243
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:03,340
And it also aligns a lot with sort of the long-term goals I have for JB as we go to

244
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,020
the next 15 years.

245
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:11,220
And that is to use as much self-hosted decentralized technology as possible.

246
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,980
And so Matrix just so clearly is kind of like a long bet.

247
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:21,580
I'm going long on decentralized and self-hosting and hoping that the return on investment will

248
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,520
be that we grow as a healthy decentralized community.

249
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,820
And by the time we get to something pretty large, it's hopefully the software is in good

250
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,820
shape.

251
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,340
We've got multiple clients to choose from.

252
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,300
Denorite is totally feature complete with Synapse and all that kind of stuff.

253
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:43,140
It seems like, and one of the reasons why I've become more enthusiastic about it is

254
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:45,260
the trend is in the right direction.

255
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:51,560
It's perhaps slower than I would expect because I was talking to the developers who were creating

256
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,800
Matrix probably a couple of years before anybody really talked about it in the public because

257
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,000
I met them at OSCON and they had a small little booth that was sponsored by somebody else.

258
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,500
And so I went up and said, what the hell is Matrix?

259
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,060
And I might have even made it into last.

260
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,920
It was a long time ago.

261
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,820
I would have thought it would be in a better spot than it is now.

262
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,340
The protocol and all that stuff is in really good shape.

263
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,660
The clients have been getting better.

264
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,460
The community adoption is growing.

265
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,240
The friction points are getting less.

266
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,660
The third party clients are getting their act together.

267
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,240
It's just all happening at the speed of organic software development.

268
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,540
You can probably sense that.

269
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,540
It's probably one of the reasons why you're willing to stick with it and put up with the

270
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,260
frustrating front end experience.

271
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,260
Yeah, certainly.

272
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,660
And not to mention all the great content that's being shared there on our networks.

273
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,420
But I agree with you completely.

274
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,300
Everything you said is like, we need to be the people that push this a little bit.

275
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,060
And I think maybe it's important to spin it a little differently.

276
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:53,140
You know, my experience was not a hundred percent, but it was like 80 at least, which

277
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,760
is saying something, you know, that feels like a huge success.

278
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:02,120
And I would imagine for those early developers of Matrix, you know, seeing it from when you

279
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,700
first met them till now, they probably feel like, geez, we've hit some massive success,

280
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,660
but we just need to keep that going.

281
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:14,920
I also think for us as, you know, the client side consumers who are early adopters, it's

282
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:21,700
a great opportunity to get involved in a project and issue some bugs maybe, and get involved

283
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,040
a little bit and have some conversation.

284
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,880
So it could be an opportunity as well.

285
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,600
My experience with the people involved with the Matrix community around Synapse 2 is they've

286
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,860
been interested to hear our experiences too, which is I think is a positive sign.

287
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,740
You know, they're not like, oh no, it's just your configuration, you did it wrong.

288
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:41,940
They're like, tell us what happened, you know, what led to this?

289
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,240
And that seems like a positive signal to me too.

290
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,580
So we'll see.

291
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,780
I think long-term it is going to be a good thing, but it is a bit rough.

292
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:54,980
And so what we've decided to do is since we're doing the office hours live on Tuesdays, every

293
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,980
other Tuesday.

294
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,940
Fortnightly, you might say.

295
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,940
Yep.

296
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,160
We've decided to use the Matrix chat room as the official on stream chat.

297
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,860
All our other shows that are live have always used IRC.

298
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,420
And so we're just going to start making it normal to just work out the kinks, you know,

299
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,420
so we can figure out the OBS integration.

300
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,380
So users can identify what doesn't work for them.

301
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,380
Just all that kind of stuff.

302
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,380
So that's my goal.

303
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:22,980
And then we'll also have the Mumble server going, which is another decentralized communications

304
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,620
tool, but it's just down today.

305
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,760
Here's why I've been banging on about decentralization more and more recently.

306
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,820
It's been like my focus in 2022 because I've seen the walls closing in on the podcasting

307
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,820
industry.

308
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,780
That's why I have been talking more about value for value, time, treasure and talent

309
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,140
and boosts.

310
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:50,980
It's about changes that are happening in the industry with centralization and other pressures

311
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,600
that are happening.

312
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,100
And I'll just talk about a couple of these.

313
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,700
Now one I've talked about before, but there's new news in this regard is Spotify.

314
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,780
Spotify has just purchased two podcast analytics companies at the same time, the two major

315
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,000
players actually, Podsites and Chartable.

316
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,140
And the job of these two companies has been to play Switzerland.

317
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:20,340
They are a third party that sits between the podcaster and the advertiser, and they measure

318
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,420
your downloads via URL redirect.

319
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,100
You'll see these sometimes in podcasters URLs, they'll have a little you redirect in there

320
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,180
like for pod track or chartable or something like that.

321
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:34,460
If you look at the actual URL for the MP3 file, and that's for a third party to track

322
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,460
the download numbers.

323
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:42,100
They're not tracking anything more than your country of origin and the download.

324
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,500
And the idea is, is that the podcaster and the advertiser can believe the numbers that

325
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,980
chartable or Podsites reports, and so that can be a neutral number from which you negotiate

326
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:58,100
ad rates and establish audience size for a podcast and things like that.

327
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:05,460
Spotify is both the podcaster and the advertiser, and now they have just bought Podsites and

328
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,460
Chartable.

329
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,300
So now the Fox is watching the hen house here is what's happening.

330
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:15,660
And this is going to reduce third party measurement capabilities that are sort of neutral.

331
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,860
And this is a problem.

332
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
Here's a quote here.

333
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,700
I pulled it says in the podcast space and really any media channel, there's always a

334
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:26,980
concern about the idea that publishers shouldn't be grading their own homework or that there

335
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:32,420
should be third party verification to help advertisers gain confidence in the space.

336
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,140
The other thing that jumped out at me here is for some reason, even though I've been

337
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:41,440
talking to you guys about this pretty much this entire year so far, some, I would guess

338
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,760
ad commentators, people who commentate on the ad business.

339
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,620
It's a company called Sounds Profitable.

340
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:52,380
They said, quote, people were shocked that Spotify bought both of them at once.

341
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,940
Buying one of them puts pressure on the other one.

342
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,380
It changes the space.

343
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,620
It creates more competition.

344
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:03,300
Buying both of them creates a hole in the space.

345
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,900
And of course, there's also concerns that Spotify's consolidation could make it even

346
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:14,140
harder to get actual real reliable data that doesn't involve creepy tracking now to Spotify

347
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,860
does a whole different level of tracking.

348
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,860
This is a problem.

349
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,340
What do you think is their motivation internally to do this?

350
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,940
You know, it obviously we know the impacts and the ramifications, but what is, you know,

351
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,060
they must have a motive other than just squashing the numbers.

352
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:35,960
So they want to be sort of the Google AdWords or Facebook marketplace of advertising for

353
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,220
audio content.

354
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:42,840
So you go to the Spotify advertising platform, you choose the demographic you're looking

355
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:46,900
for, so you could say millennials, you could say millennial females, you could say millennial

356
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,740
males, you could say, you know, different age groups, different demographics in terms

357
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,980
of work and interests.

358
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:59,500
And then you can use this automated system to buy and bid on advertising that then gets

359
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,720
dynamically inserted into the podcast upon download.

360
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,660
And so they're always bidding those slots in real time and they kind of become the go

361
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,660
to place.

362
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:13,660
And before this, they were already sort of becoming the go to place in advertising.

363
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,100
I've been having a conversation with some of our advertisers and Spotify is pushing

364
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,100
this hard.

365
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,980
They basically want to be Google ads for podcasting.

366
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,980
I don't like it.

367
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,620
I mean, I didn't like it before.

368
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,180
I really don't like it now.

369
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,280
Which would be a massive centralization of revenue in the podcast industry, right?

370
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,180
It would make Spotify essentially the ultimate gatekeeper.

371
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:38,140
Not to bang on about how bad the situation is, but there's another angle to this too

372
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,700
that's closing in on the podcasting industry.

373
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:46,740
The Brookings Institute, which is essentially a think tank that provides often bad policy

374
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,740
ideas to the critters in DC.

375
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:56,520
And they're now making recommendations for addressing content moderation in podcasts.

376
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,580
It's time for a reckoning in podcasts.

377
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,580
Just as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube and other digital platforms have struggled for

378
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:06,700
years with difficult questions about what content to allow on their platforms, podcast

379
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,780
apps must now weigh them as well.

380
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,060
So this is from the Brookings Institute that I'm reading from and it's a very long piece,

381
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,180
but I've highlighted a couple of critical sections here.

382
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,380
I'll put the link to this in the show notes.

383
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:24,340
For starters, they write, podcast apps, podcasting apps need to develop a far more nuanced and

384
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:31,600
transparent policies for the kinds of content that users can download and play.

385
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,820
Podcasting applications should also have clear guidelines for what kinds of podcasts the

386
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,060
app itself will recommend.

387
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,460
So they're even talking about tweaking what the apps recommend.

388
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:48,940
Now the reason why I have obvious concerns with this is what is considered a loud speech,

389
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:54,300
safe speech, and they even say a legal speech in here, which is an interesting concept that

390
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,780
shifts with time.

391
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,140
And so like right now, this wouldn't necessarily affect any of the core Jupiter broadcasting

392
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,140
shows.

393
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,620
This clearly would be a concern for something like Unfilter, but this would not be a concern

394
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,300
for any of the Jupiter broadcasting shows today.

395
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:16,980
But if a horrendous like incident happened that changed the conversation around encryption,

396
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,180
maybe some sort of event where it couldn't be prevented or we couldn't find out who did

397
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:27,200
it because of encryption, and the conversation around encryption flips and it becomes a matter

398
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,860
of national security, well at that point in time I'll be on air advocating for the right

399
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,860
to encryption and privacy.

400
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:41,100
I'm not going to change my position, but society around me may change one day on that particular

401
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,100
point.

402
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,980
Same for Bitcoin.

403
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:50,380
There could have been a version of reality where free software was thought of as an extreme

404
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:55,720
anti-capitalistic idea, and there is probably an alternate reality where they shut down

405
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:01,100
speech about free software because it harms the economy, it harms capitalism.

406
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,900
It just depends on the state of society at the time.

407
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:11,860
And podcasts are the last bastion of truly open thought, and they're also a great example

408
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,180
of the user being able to select or deselect that stuff.

409
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,700
But the Brookings Institute is saying that we need to make it easy to start reporting

410
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,640
podcasters who say the wrong thing.

411
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:29,660
Podcast apps need to build in reporting tools, and they show how Spotify fails to do that,

412
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,300
but Apple already allows for that.

413
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,960
And of course it needs to go beyond just what podcast developers do.

414
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,660
There needs to be regulation, and again the Brookings Institute, that's their job, right?

415
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:44,760
They make policy that Congress creators can put their name on.

416
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,620
So they write here, regulation and lawmakers have a role to play in shaping the policies

417
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,260
in the podcast ecosystem.

418
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,880
Apparently there's policies in this ecosystem.

419
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,940
Policy makers and regulators should push for greater transparency on content guidelines

420
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,600
and policies, clear guidelines about what we're allowed or what is restricted to talk

421
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
about.

422
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Of course they should be transparent.

423
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,940
Moderation practices and appeals processes for all podcast apps should be regulated.

424
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:20,900
So all podcast apps must have the ability for a pissed off listener to report me, and

425
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,780
the recommendation algorithms they use for discovery must be regulated such that they

426
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,780
don't position anti-political content as popular.

427
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:35,860
And that they throw some numbers in here and they say there's a public interest, a public

428
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,180
good in understanding how all of these algorithms will work for these different apps, and making

429
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,040
sure that there's a basic list of what they call factors about what the algorithm considers

430
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:50,200
when it's boosting an episode or a series to the viewer.

431
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:58,320
And then last but not least, but really the core piece of all of this, funding.

432
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,620
Regulators need to get involved with funding for podcasts.

433
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:08,860
At present, advertising represents the primary source of revenue for the podcasting industry.

434
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,700
That means there's a vulnerability there.

435
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,140
So perhaps there's regulation that could be applied to podcast advertisers, and we need

436
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:21,500
more transparency, and we need to apply the radio reporting guidelines to this market.

437
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,700
And given the size of the podcast ecosystem, these guidelines might need to be limited

438
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,820
to series that generate maybe a certain minimum revenue.

439
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,220
So I'm going to have to also report my revenue, however they're going to judge that, or an

440
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,220
audience size.

441
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,020
So however this regulator regulation body is, I'm going to have to report to them my

442
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,460
audience size.

443
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,060
So that way we have an additional level of transparency, they argue.

444
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,140
You see where this is going.

445
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,020
They argue in short, regulators should push podcasting applications to adhere to the emerging

446
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,980
standards for transparency.

447
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,740
And they have some they recommend, and they've published those.

448
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,900
This is why we've been talking about value for value.

449
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,780
This is why we've been talking about boosts.

450
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,380
Now this is pretty close to me, you know, this is my baby, hold the whole podcasting

451
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,380
thing.

452
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,380
So do you think I'm overreacting, Brent?

453
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,380
Or, you know, you look at all this together, is this maybe time to start taking this a

454
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,380
little more seriously?

455
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:14,140
I don't feel like you're overreacting at all.

456
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:19,560
Hearing you read all of that got me like, I don't know, a little scared, I think might

457
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,740
be the word.

458
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:26,180
Because it feels to me like podcasting was born of an era where everything was so like

459
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,900
stiff and controlled.

460
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,660
And it was finally a way that people could just, you know, you're a perfect example.

461
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:38,260
People could just, by themselves, record something and share it to, you know, an audience.

462
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:42,940
And it feels like they're just trying to take that idea and turn it into what was the old

463
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,940
system.

464
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,260
That just feels antithetical to me.

465
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,300
It's like, well, we're just gonna come out with something new then, if that's the case.

466
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,780
And not without a heck of a lot of work and like some pretty combative outcomes, I would

467
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,780
imagine.

468
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,220
So I don't like this at all.

469
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:05,720
It's also happening right now, when Elon Musk is sort of forced upon the social media world,

470
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,160
this debate about how much free speech is good.

471
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:15,740
Podcasting I think is born of sort of a free speech absolutism mentality because there's

472
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:22,060
such selection, there's so many podcasts, that if somebody's a kook, you don't have

473
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,060
to listen to them.

474
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,200
You can go somewhere else.

475
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,820
And I know the argument is, well, the susceptible person might listen to like an Alex Jones

476
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,060
type and get radicalized.

477
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,700
I suppose that is indeed possible.

478
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,420
I know people who have listened to stuff like that and gotten pretty worked up.

479
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:44,940
But I also think it's sort of not giving folks enough credit for being intelligent and putting

480
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,540
things together on their own and evolving their opinion over time.

481
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,440
And I know we all know people who don't, but we all know people who do as well.

482
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,540
And so it's not really our decision to make.

483
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,760
That's my take on it.

484
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,800
And so I hate to see this kind of stuff come because also it would make running a business

485
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,760
more expensive, no doubt about it.

486
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,200
From a selfish standpoint, it's sort of already a lean operation.

487
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:10,740
And so having to jump through hoops like disclosing audience information to some, I don't know

488
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,500
whoever it would be, the FCC, I don't know who it would be, but if they're talking about

489
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,640
applying the radio transparency guideline standards for advertising, you have to disclose

490
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,640
your audience reach, your audience size, your revenue, all of that.

491
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,160
And then it seems like you've really opened the door to essentially controlling the speech

492
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,520
of podcasters because not only are you normalizing a method to report them, which is already

493
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,320
shown to be erroneous more often than not on social media and on YouTube, but you're

494
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,480
not really improving upon those systems.

495
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,620
Those systems are essentially flawed.

496
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:48,920
And I think the fundamental argument for their use is actually in question right now.

497
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,260
And so to just kind of blindly move forward on initiatives like this without ever really

498
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:59,920
stopping and reevaluating what we've done so far and if it has or has not been successful,

499
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,560
it always strikes me as perhaps there's another motivation.

500
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,780
Because if the motivation was pure and just, then self-reflection would be built in.

501
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,380
And we'd be reflecting on the types of moderation that we've been implementing and what has

502
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:16,480
been successful and what has failed, what moderation went too far, what moderation didn't

503
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,020
kick in soon enough, and we'd be evaluating that and improving upon it.

504
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:25,160
And we'd be creating it in a way that was fair for everyone.

505
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,880
But that's not what's happening.

506
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,080
Instead, we're just sort of marching forward with this vague idea that we have to protect

507
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:34,120
people from misinformation so that way they don't get fooled because they're not smart

508
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,320
enough to figure it out on their own.

509
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,020
And you know, we thought it'd stop on Twitter, but it's not, right?

510
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,800
We've seen it spread to YouTube.

511
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,040
We've seen it spread to all of the other platforms.

512
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,440
We've seen it spread to places that we probably don't even realize it's happening.

513
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,160
Now we're seeing it happen in the podcast space.

514
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:53,000
And the thing about something like this coming from the Brookings Institute is this is the

515
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,320
scary stuff that happens sort of in the slow kind of creep way, not the flashy propagandized

516
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,560
version by a company that comes out and swings from like their keynote stage.

517
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,860
This is the way DC really works.

518
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,380
And that's what kind of alarms me about this is this is the way you actually get new policy

519
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,760
and regulations, this and money.

520
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,160
But that's how these think tank works to begin with.

521
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,920
So I'll have a link to that in the show notes if you guys are curious.

522
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,960
But that's one of the reasons why why we've been looking for other models and whatnot.

523
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,960
But we are looking for ways to improve to Brent.

524
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,700
You know, it's not just about the monies.

525
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,600
It's also about just making experience better for folks and taking in feedback and input.

526
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,920
And so we've been launching various ways for people to give us that feedback, including

527
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,240
there's a new general questions email.

528
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:43,080
If something you want to get in front of us for this show, you can send an email to questions

529
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,800
at Jupiter broadcasting dot com or you can use the general comments drop down on the

530
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,180
J.B. contact page.

531
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,560
But Brent, you've been working on a new GitHub page where people can file issues.

532
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,940
Yeah, we've been thinking, geez, there are, you know, both issues that we notice and also

533
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:03,780
that you as listeners seem to notice and gathering them all in one place sounds like a really

534
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,780
great idea.

535
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,040
And also selfishly, I wanted to learn how to use GitHub because I'm not that well versed

536
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
at it.

537
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,520
But I've been setting up in the background a little Jupiter broadcasting, a bunch of

538
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,600
little GitHub projects that you can file bugs against issues, I suppose they call them.

539
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,680
So for instance, I made one public here that we can share right away.

540
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,620
We made one for the matrix server.

541
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:29,460
So if there's anything going on with the matrix server, including what I'll call feature requests,

542
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,440
you know, if there's a new room idea that you have, that's a perfect place to throw

543
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,320
that in and get our attention and we can easily implement that if we think it's really great.

544
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,960
So I would recommend that people try to use that.

545
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:46,280
Even if you are not that familiar with GitHub, maybe it's a great way to start getting familiar

546
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
like me.

547
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,320
We'll also have various projects for, for instance, the website and maybe some of the

548
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,320
membership stuff.

549
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,420
I know we're having some feed issues sometimes and that's a great place to put that too.

550
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:02,600
We got a note that came into the show via boost, which we have signed this up for the

551
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,600
boost support.

552
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,100
So if you want to support the show and get your message in, in fact, I'm encouraging

553
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,200
also bug reports over boost, like you got something you've been thinking about the network

554
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,400
should do, should do better, send your criticism, your comments, your concerns over a boost

555
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,520
and we'll get them into the show.

556
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,480
But we got 500 sats from Eric Jr. and he says, I'm glad you guys covered the wise camera

557
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,360
security issues in self hosted 68.

558
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,880
Thanks for looking out for everyone.

559
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,920
I wish we had a good barbecue place in central California.

560
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,760
Now here's my question.

561
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,960
If you know of a great place kind of near the I five corridor from the very tippity

562
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,940
top of California to the very south of California, a place where 30, 40, 50, 80 people could

563
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:48,560
hang out along that I five corridor of California, send us in a boost or an email questions at

564
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,520
Jupiter broadcasting.com.

565
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,580
Let me know or Chris at Jupiter broadcasting.com.

566
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:57,720
I don't care how you do it, but I'm looking to collect information on strategic spots

567
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,760
that if we end up doing something down in California, we could have a few spots along

568
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,840
the way where we could meet up with people, do little micro meetups and stuff like that.

569
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,160
Also a lot of boosts about people that are kind of upset that we don't have the ability

570
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,680
to send boosts from the members feeds.

571
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,000
That's a third party service limitation.

572
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,520
They generate that RSS feed, not us.

573
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:28,080
And as such, we cannot add the value tag, but it really is pissing people off.

574
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,640
And I, you know, you know, I did not expect that the people who are already supporting

575
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,160
us through a membership would then also want to boost.

576
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,160
That's amazing.

577
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,020
They're amazing people and they're awesome.

578
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:42,140
So we got 5,000 stats from Zach's and he says, I'm a Jupiter signal supporter.

579
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,280
So I get the core contribute other feeds, which are apparently not set up to receive

580
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,280
lightning payments.

581
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,200
Now I've heard you talk about value for value, so I bought some BTC for the first time just

582
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,160
to set this all up, but I was disappointed to have to troubleshoot this.

583
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,280
Eventually I had to subscribe to the main feed just to send this.

584
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,160
I love the shows, but I wanted to let you know, I'd be happy to send a boost from time

585
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,600
to time if you set up lightning for the supporter feeds.

586
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,160
Oh, kills me.

587
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,360
Yeah, it kills me.

588
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,960
He saying, Chris, can I please send you some stats?

589
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,780
And I'm like, no, sorry.

590
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,200
Which is what this whole system was trying to avoid, isn't it?

591
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,200
Yeah.

592
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,320
Again, a problem of centralization with these services is that they control all of this.

593
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,360
And the flip side with some of this is this is what we try to balance.

594
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:27,320
It's like, well, is managing the member stuff something we really want to balance?

595
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,200
Or do we want to use a service that is known for doing this correctly and securely and

596
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:38,280
privately and does that part and then generates the feed based on your membership status?

597
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,360
That's the route we decided to go.

598
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,480
And I'm not sure it was the wrong one because I'm not really sure we should be building

599
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,560
our own membership system.

600
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,840
That sounds like a nightmare.

601
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,920
Perhaps there's some way we could do that in the future.

602
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,600
But this is the downside to that kind of stuff.

603
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,680
And those are the trade-offs we're constantly making.

604
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:59,080
Most of the time, we just sort of go on the self-hosted side and Wes figures it out.

605
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,080
It's true.

606
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,480
Thank goodness for Wes.

607
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,420
But every now and then, we got to help him out and do things like maybe find a provider

608
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,240
who offers a good membership system.

609
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,640
But we got boost from listener in Manchester, too.

610
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,280
But I'm going to save that for the self-hosted podcast because he's in there talking about

611
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,000
a self-hosted stuff.

612
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Thanks everybody in there.

613
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:22,160
If you'd like to send us a boost, go get yourself a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com and

614
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,760
then you can boost.

615
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Boost.

616
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,760
That's a robot.

617
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
Did you hear it?

618
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,560
I did, but I was trying to identify who it was.

619
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,560
Boost.

620
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,560
I think it's a speak and spell robot.

621
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,560
Oh, really?

622
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
Yeah.

623
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Right?

624
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
Boost.

625
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
It could be.

626
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Yeah, it could be.

627
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
Oh, man.

628
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,560
I love it.

629
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,560
I love it.

630
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,560
I love it.

631
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,560
This is just a test episode.

632
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,760
But here's the idea is that fortnightly on a Tuesday, starting next Tuesday, which will

633
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:56,520
be April 26th, oh man, that's going to be complicated for me, but starting next Tuesday

634
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,840
and then fortnightly after that, we're going to do this show.

635
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,200
I think that's the plan.

636
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,720
We'll have the mumble room working by then.

637
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,160
The server is just down today as we record.

638
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:11,020
We'll be using the JB chat on the matrix server to do the live chat and we'll talk about things

639
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,020
that we're working on.

640
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,520
We'll talk about some of the projects we have coming up.

641
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,560
I may have firmer details on the JB road trip that we are brewing.

642
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,840
And of course, we'll have your boost and your questions to cover, too.

643
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,400
So that'll be a big part of the show.

644
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,960
I think that's it, Brentley.

645
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,120
I have a question for you as a listener.

646
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,120
Oh, yeah.

647
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,120
Okay.

648
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
How's it going to work for guests?

649
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,120
Are you going to have special guests?

650
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,120
Are you going to like?

651
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,120
I think so.

652
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,880
That was one of the reasons I wanted to do this is I wanted to create a platform where

653
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,640
every now and then something that didn't quite fit in the show, you know, could be brought

654
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,640
in and we could chat.

655
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
Mm hmm.

656
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,440
Recently, I've been chatting behind the scenes with like a tail scale engineer.

657
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,440
I'd love to kind of pick his brain.

658
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,480
I don't know if there's a particular show that fits on, but I think so.

659
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,760
Are you going to join me next time?

660
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:54,760
What do you think?

661
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,760
That's my question.

662
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,920
I'm so used to Tuesdays being our sort of sit down and do the podcast day, but I think

663
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,960
I think that might happen more often than not.

664
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,960
Well, you know, my office door is always open.

665
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,960
Oh, that's kind of you.

666
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,960
Thank you.

667
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,960
Although when we record, we should probably close the door.

668
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,960
Yeah.

669
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,960
I don't want to let the horse out.

670
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,320
But I'll be in my office on Tuesdays, at least fortnightly.

671
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,040
So you come in, you join me.

672
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,960
Audiences, welcome to join us live or we'll be publishing this over at office hours dot

673
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,640
