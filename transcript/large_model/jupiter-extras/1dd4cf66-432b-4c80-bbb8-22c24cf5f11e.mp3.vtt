00:00.000 --> 00:01.920
What really excites me though is to introduce

00:01.920 --> 00:02.760
our keynote speaker.

00:02.760 --> 00:04.940
Our keynote speaker is Thomas Cameron.

00:04.940 --> 00:07.720
He currently works as AWS's solution architect,

00:07.720 --> 00:11.520
but he's been doing Linux since before AWS existed.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.560
And he's been a long time speaker at Texas Linux Fest.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.360
And I'm really excited to bring him here

00:16.360 --> 00:19.360
to kick off our Saturday presentations,

00:19.360 --> 00:21.080
talking about the state of the union of Linux.

00:21.080 --> 00:21.920
Thank you.

00:21.920 --> 00:22.740
Thank you.

00:22.740 --> 00:23.580
Thank you.

00:23.580 --> 00:30.200
Thank you guys very much. I appreciate it.

00:30.200 --> 00:32.560
It is truly an honor to be here.

00:32.560 --> 00:36.320
I've been involved with Texas Linux Fest for years

00:36.320 --> 00:38.920
and it's fantastic to be here up on the main stage.

00:38.920 --> 00:40.920
And I appreciate you all being here.

00:40.920 --> 00:43.800
Definitely, you know, welcome and thank you so much

00:43.800 --> 00:45.800
for being here on a Saturday morning.

00:45.800 --> 00:46.800
I know that if you're like me,

00:46.800 --> 00:48.360
you'd rather probably be, you know,

00:48.360 --> 00:51.200
carefully inspecting the backs of your eyelids right now,

00:51.200 --> 00:54.040
but I do appreciate you being here.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.080
Just out of curiosity,

00:55.080 --> 00:58.200
how many folks are here from outside of the DFW area?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.120
Wow.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.560
That is phenomenal.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.880
Thank you even more than for traveling to be here.

01:04.880 --> 01:06.960
That's amazing.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.000
So who am I and why should you care?

01:11.000 --> 01:11.840
Should you care?

01:11.840 --> 01:12.660
I don't know.

01:12.660 --> 01:13.980
We'll see.

01:13.980 --> 01:15.360
A little bit about me.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.600
As mentioned earlier, my name is Thomas Cameron.

01:17.600 --> 01:21.960
I started in the IT industry in 1993.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.880
Raise your hand if you were not born yet in 1993.

01:27.640 --> 01:28.880
Okay.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.560
To me, very honestly,

01:31.560 --> 01:33.880
I still sort of feel like Linux

01:33.880 --> 01:38.640
is this new upstart cool technology, you know?

01:38.640 --> 01:40.320
But the reality is it's been around

01:40.320 --> 01:41.960
for a very, very long time.

01:41.960 --> 01:44.120
I have an interesting path

01:44.120 --> 01:46.080
or I had an interesting path to get here.

01:46.080 --> 01:48.920
I actually started out as a police officer.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.780
I was a volunteer

01:50.780 --> 01:52.440
and then a non-sworn corrections officer

01:52.440 --> 01:53.760
and then a sworn police officer.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.600
Spent about eight years in law enforcement.

01:55.600 --> 01:58.120
Realized that I qualified for food stamps

01:58.120 --> 02:01.080
and changed careers into IT.

02:01.080 --> 02:03.120
So back in the day,

02:03.120 --> 02:07.620
I started out as a Novell certified NetWare engineer.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.180
All right, I'm dating myself, yeah.

02:11.180 --> 02:13.880
And I have fond memories of upgrading

02:13.880 --> 02:17.600
a 2.5 megabit per second ArtNet network

02:17.600 --> 02:20.800
to a blazing fast four megabit per second

02:20.800 --> 02:22.800
token ring environment.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.040
All right.

02:27.040 --> 02:30.560
So my point here is I'm not thumping my chest

02:30.560 --> 02:32.520
and saying I'm anything special because I'm not.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.480
I've just been around for a while.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.240
And I think I've got some pretty impressive scars.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.720
Started with Slackware Linux.

02:39.720 --> 02:40.560
When it comes to Linux,

02:40.560 --> 02:43.920
I started with Slackware Linux back in 1995.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.320
I was actually working for Microsoft at the time.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.620
Don't hold that against me.

02:48.560 --> 02:51.640
I was working during the launch of Windows 95.

02:51.640 --> 02:53.120
I was a technical development engineer

02:53.120 --> 02:54.800
at one of the support facilities.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.720
And there was this guy who worked for me

02:56.720 --> 02:57.760
named Tim Goldenberg.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.220
And I will never forget this kid.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.840
This kid who's now 47 years old.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.920
He was talking about Linux.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.520
And we were all learning Windows 95

03:06.520 --> 03:08.120
and we were learning how to integrate 95

03:08.120 --> 03:11.760
into the NT networks, NT 351 and NT 40 beta,

03:11.760 --> 03:12.900
which is pretty cool.

03:14.520 --> 03:17.200
And he kept talking about how Linux was so cool

03:17.200 --> 03:19.480
and it was really up and coming.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.920
And I had drunk the Kool-Aid, honestly.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.040
And I turned to him and I was like,

03:23.040 --> 03:26.520
Tim, man, Unix is dead.

03:26.520 --> 03:29.400
Windows is the future.

03:29.400 --> 03:31.980
And he kept on and kept on and kept on.

03:31.980 --> 03:34.100
And I finally said, dang it, Tim.

03:34.100 --> 03:37.280
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set up one machine

03:37.280 --> 03:39.920
with Windows NT 351.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.900
And I'm gonna set up another machine with Linux.

03:42.900 --> 03:44.680
Didn't know anything about Linux at the time.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.780
But I'm gonna set up Linux and I'm gonna prove to you

03:47.780 --> 03:50.000
that NT is the superior platform.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.560
You can see how that turned out.

03:53.560 --> 03:58.560
So I spent several days, I mean, probably like a week

04:02.520 --> 04:05.340
trying to get Slackware Linux installed

04:05.340 --> 04:09.740
on I think at the time it was a Pentium 90 with,

04:11.100 --> 04:15.660
I wanna say that I had splurged and spent about $450

04:15.660 --> 04:20.660
to get it up to eight megabytes of memory, megabytes.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.240
And I finally, I mean, I had gone through all the

04:24.240 --> 04:27.400
trying to figure out F disk for Linux

04:27.400 --> 04:29.280
as opposed to F disk for DOS.

04:29.280 --> 04:32.240
What do you mean swap partition?

04:32.240 --> 04:33.960
What the hell are you talking about?

04:33.960 --> 04:36.520
Swap is a file, everybody, what?

04:36.520 --> 04:39.200
Boot and root and there's no drive letters.

04:39.200 --> 04:42.040
What the hell's the matter with you people?

04:42.040 --> 04:46.600
So I finally, after a week, complete the installation

04:46.600 --> 04:47.640
and it doesn't crash out.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.320
You go complete installation and it's gonna reboot.

04:50.320 --> 04:53.400
And it rebooted and it came up to a login prompt.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.160
And I was like, what the hell do I do now?

04:58.440 --> 05:01.360
So playing around with Linux,

05:01.360 --> 05:05.440
one of the things that actually blew me away

05:05.440 --> 05:08.880
that made me convinced that maybe Tim was right

05:08.880 --> 05:13.880
was and it's silly, echo one greater than

05:14.920 --> 05:18.800
slash proc slash sys slash net slash ipv4

05:18.800 --> 05:21.200
slash ip underscore forward.

05:22.920 --> 05:26.760
I could turn on and turn off routing in the kernel

05:28.400 --> 05:30.280
from the command line.

05:30.280 --> 05:32.760
On my NT machine, if I had two network cards

05:32.760 --> 05:34.440
or I had a network card and a modem

05:34.440 --> 05:36.960
because back then we were working on modems.

05:36.960 --> 05:40.160
If I had to turn routing on, it said,

05:40.160 --> 05:44.680
I've accepted your changes, now reboot.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.880
I know it's silly, but that was one of the things

05:47.880 --> 05:52.080
that made me go, holy crap, this is pretty cool.

05:52.080 --> 05:56.440
So that's sort of how I got started with Linux.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.520
I was certified as a Red Hat certified engineer

05:59.520 --> 06:03.120
back in 1999 on Red Hat Linux 6.1.

06:03.120 --> 06:06.960
I had written a training guide for Red Hat Linux,

06:06.960 --> 06:09.120
about a 450 page training guide.

06:09.120 --> 06:13.200
I owned a small company that did IT consulting and training.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.480
And we developed a training program

06:15.480 --> 06:18.720
that attracted organizations like Compaq.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.400
Compaq did Red Hat training with me.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.000
You guys, some of the older folks in here

06:23.000 --> 06:25.440
will remember Deja News.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.640
Remember the aggregator for Usenet?

06:27.640 --> 06:29.640
They sent their staff to come train.

06:30.920 --> 06:35.040
The US Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service

06:35.040 --> 06:36.400
sent their people to train.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.200
I was very conflicted about that.

06:38.200 --> 06:41.080
Especially when I got the phone call,

06:42.040 --> 06:43.320
ring, ring, ring,

06:43.320 --> 06:45.520
Cameron Technical Services, can I help you?

06:46.440 --> 06:49.920
This is Agent Jones with the Internal Revenue Service

06:51.000 --> 06:53.080
Division of Criminal Investigations.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.560
Who am I speaking with, please?

06:59.240 --> 07:00.080
Thomas.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.720
I understand you do Linux training, is that correct?

07:05.720 --> 07:08.680
And I'm thinking, what the hell could I have possibly done?

07:12.440 --> 07:14.560
I have some of my agents that need to get Linux training

07:14.560 --> 07:25.920
because we do forensics around seized computers.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.560
Said, you like doing that, don't you?

07:27.560 --> 07:29.160
And he goes, oh, I live for it.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.880
So, you know, an interesting time back in the 90s

07:35.880 --> 07:37.440
doing Linux training and consulting,

07:37.440 --> 07:39.200
because it was so new.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.040
Interesting little trivia bit.

07:41.040 --> 07:46.600
I am Turbo Linux certified instructor number 001.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.880
Has anyone ever even used Turbo Linux?

07:49.880 --> 07:51.360
Long time ago, right?

07:51.360 --> 07:53.040
Yeah, so my company,

07:53.040 --> 07:54.680
because I had done all this training material

07:54.680 --> 07:56.200
around Red Hat Linux,

07:56.200 --> 07:58.840
my company was contracted by Turbo Linux for a few months

07:58.840 --> 08:01.480
and we developed a training program, put it all together,

08:01.480 --> 08:03.360
wrote the guides, I delivered the first class,

08:03.360 --> 08:04.440
did a train the trainer,

08:04.440 --> 08:06.560
and within like three months they reorganized

08:06.560 --> 08:07.800
and did away with training.

08:07.800 --> 08:12.120
But damn it, I am number one.

08:12.120 --> 08:14.440
I worked for Red Hat for about 14 years.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.040
I was a solution architect,

08:16.040 --> 08:18.120
and then I worked my way up from solution architect

08:18.120 --> 08:19.800
to senior to principal to senior principal

08:19.800 --> 08:22.360
to chief architect for the central US.

08:22.360 --> 08:23.840
And then the last four years that I was there,

08:23.840 --> 08:27.560
I was an evangelist for Red Hat Enterprise Linux globally.

08:27.560 --> 08:30.360
Great experience, great company.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.480
I got a lot of Red Hat friends in the audience.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.640
I really enjoyed it, but it was time for a change,

08:34.640 --> 08:37.400
so I did move over to Amazon Web Services

08:37.400 --> 08:38.760
about two and a half months ago,

08:38.760 --> 08:40.960
so I'm still really, really new to AWS.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.400
I do want to make very clear,

08:43.400 --> 08:45.120
I am here as a community member only.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.160
I do not claim to represent AWS,

08:47.160 --> 08:49.200
certainly don't claim to represent Red Hat.

08:49.200 --> 08:51.000
I will talk about experiences,

08:51.000 --> 08:55.760
but my opinions are my own, and they may be wrong.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.080
So, as I said earlier,

09:00.080 --> 09:02.680
I don't claim to be particularly wise.

09:02.680 --> 09:04.360
I've just been doing this for a long time

09:04.360 --> 09:05.960
and I've seen a lot of crazy stuff.

09:05.960 --> 09:09.960
So, to talk about what's going on,

09:09.960 --> 09:12.840
I think we kind of have to talk about where we came from.

09:12.840 --> 09:15.520
And so to talk about where we came from,

09:15.520 --> 09:17.200
you need to understand the past

09:17.200 --> 09:19.000
to understand where we're going.

09:19.920 --> 09:23.320
As I alluded to earlier, when I got started with Linux,

09:23.320 --> 09:26.000
I loved it because it was so different

09:26.000 --> 09:28.240
from anything that I had done before.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.800
Real honestly, everything that I'd done previously

09:30.800 --> 09:33.280
was it was software that I'd gotten from work,

09:33.280 --> 09:36.000
or it was software that I got a spare copy

09:36.000 --> 09:38.080
because we used it in the data center or whatever.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.440
And I always sort of had this feeling of,

09:40.440 --> 09:43.520
you know, really, I didn't pay for these licenses,

09:43.520 --> 09:45.560
don't really care because I'm not gonna pay

09:45.560 --> 09:49.680
250 bucks for an office suite in 1995 or whatever.

09:49.680 --> 09:53.760
But it was amazing because I could use it,

09:53.760 --> 09:56.240
I could download it, I could play around with it,

09:56.240 --> 09:57.560
and it was totally okay.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.640
It was free software, and that was fantastic.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.600
From a technical perspective,

10:02.600 --> 10:05.440
one of the things that blew me away about Linux

10:05.440 --> 10:08.320
was that it was natively multi-user.

10:08.320 --> 10:12.520
And if you think about it, like when I got started in 1995,

10:12.520 --> 10:15.560
the only multi-user service that was out there,

10:15.560 --> 10:17.320
the only multi-user operating system

10:17.320 --> 10:20.440
that was out there for x86 for PCs was,

10:20.440 --> 10:21.280
anyone remember?

10:23.800 --> 10:25.120
Citrix.

10:25.120 --> 10:28.360
You remember Citrix, the Citrix terminal server?

10:28.360 --> 10:32.080
Does anyone remember how much that cost?

10:32.080 --> 10:35.080
It was insanely expensive.

10:35.080 --> 10:37.560
And here, I had this distro that I could download,

10:37.560 --> 10:40.000
the floppies, and install,

10:40.000 --> 10:42.440
and I had multi-user with actual user accounts

10:42.440 --> 10:43.640
and multiple people could be logged on,

10:43.640 --> 10:44.640
it was no big deal.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.840
So that was a huge, huge change,

10:46.840 --> 10:48.420
and it was really powerful.

10:49.920 --> 10:52.920
Windows, which is what we all knew on the desktop,

10:52.920 --> 10:55.280
used cooperative multitasking.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.480
And cooperative multitasking means

10:57.480 --> 10:59.120
when an application gets launched,

10:59.120 --> 11:01.280
that application basically says,

11:01.280 --> 11:05.120
I'm gonna run, and when I'm done,

11:05.120 --> 11:06.560
I'm going to turn control over

11:06.560 --> 11:09.240
to the next process that runs.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.160
Anyone see a flaw with that logic?

11:13.200 --> 11:16.120
If an application crashed and it never got to the part

11:16.120 --> 11:18.640
where it said, okay, now you can go,

11:18.640 --> 11:20.080
there's a reason that control delete

11:20.080 --> 11:23.200
is the most famous key sequence in the universe.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.360
And sometimes that didn't work

11:24.360 --> 11:25.800
and you end up having to hit the power button, right?

11:25.800 --> 11:29.000
So with Linux, you actually had this operating system

11:29.000 --> 11:31.080
that went, no, no, no, I'm in charge.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.640
I will let you go, process,

11:33.640 --> 11:36.520
until such time as I deem that you need to stop,

11:36.520 --> 11:39.080
and then I will time slice the next process.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.980
So this preemptive multitasking was like,

11:40.980 --> 11:43.760
holy cow, it doesn't crash much.

11:45.220 --> 11:47.080
Don't get me wrong, I remember the ping of death, right?

11:47.080 --> 11:48.560
I've crashed Linux machines,

11:48.560 --> 11:50.100
but my point is it was like,

11:50.100 --> 11:51.600
it was this incredible operating system

11:51.600 --> 11:53.160
that was solid and multi-user,

11:53.160 --> 11:56.640
and networking was native.

11:56.640 --> 11:58.500
It wasn't an add-on.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.880
If you remember back in the Windows 3.1

12:00.880 --> 12:02.600
and Windows for Workgroups timeframe,

12:02.600 --> 12:05.980
anyone remember Trumpet Windsock, right?

12:05.980 --> 12:08.620
Just cut with the veins, not against.

12:08.620 --> 12:10.920
You know, I mean, it was a pain.

12:10.920 --> 12:12.420
It was a pain to get IP networking.

12:12.420 --> 12:13.520
It was a pain to get dial-up.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.600
It was a pain to do all of those things,

12:15.600 --> 12:17.760
and you had to get these add-ons to make it work,

12:17.760 --> 12:21.440
and even then, you're still running a 16-bit OS

12:21.440 --> 12:24.060
that was, you know, cranky and clunky

12:24.060 --> 12:26.040
and a pain in the butt.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.740
So the OS was pretty awesome.

12:29.680 --> 12:33.100
Hardware, it's a little challenging.

12:34.180 --> 12:37.740
Anybody remember, and this is kind of an eye chart,

12:37.740 --> 12:41.580
but you remember the 8-bit ISA bus?

12:42.780 --> 12:46.680
And then we got 16-bit ISA that ran at eight megahertz.

12:46.680 --> 12:47.520
Woo-hoo!

12:47.520 --> 12:49.260
We were in high cotton.

12:49.260 --> 12:52.960
And then we moved into microchannel architecture,

12:52.960 --> 12:54.900
which is an abomination from IBM

12:54.900 --> 12:57.000
that we shall not mention again.

12:58.740 --> 13:00.640
And then it evolved over time.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.240
We moved into extended ISA or ISA,

13:03.240 --> 13:04.840
so we finally got to 32-bit.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.400
Remember Visa Local Bus?

13:06.400 --> 13:07.780
Visa Local Bus video cards?

13:07.780 --> 13:09.640
Man, that was, ooh, that was awesome!

13:09.640 --> 13:11.980
And then they were, no, no, we're gonna do PCI now.

13:11.980 --> 13:14.820
And then, oh, no, no, no, AGP is the way to go,

13:14.820 --> 13:17.280
and AGP is gonna win, I thought.

13:17.280 --> 13:18.620
This PCI thing, no.

13:18.620 --> 13:21.360
Well, okay, so maybe I wasn't too correct about that.

13:21.360 --> 13:24.400
And then we finally moved into the PCI Express stuff.

13:24.400 --> 13:29.400
But this was a smoking hot video card back in the day.

13:32.700 --> 13:35.500
This was an amazing video card.

13:35.500 --> 13:38.080
This was a Trident video card.

13:38.080 --> 13:43.080
Those chips right there, 128K of memory each, baby.

13:44.720 --> 13:47.420
That was a one meg video card.

13:47.420 --> 13:50.460
800 by 600, whether you needed it or not.

13:53.060 --> 13:56.120
And for those of us who worked in the data center,

13:56.120 --> 13:59.500
AHA 1542, baby.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.400
16-bit bus, and I know it's kinda hard to see

14:02.400 --> 14:03.900
because these colors are washed out,

14:03.900 --> 14:07.540
but there are banks and banks of jumpers

14:09.280 --> 14:12.500
where we had to set I.O. addresses,

14:12.500 --> 14:16.420
IRQs, DMA addresses, SCSI IDs,

14:16.420 --> 14:18.040
whether it was gonna terminate on the wire

14:18.040 --> 14:22.480
or terminate on the card, and all of it was black magic.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.920
We tried to figure this stuff out,

14:24.920 --> 14:26.480
and you'd get on the news groups

14:26.480 --> 14:27.960
and figure out what the hell this thing was

14:27.960 --> 14:31.260
and finally get it working and not touch it ever again.

14:33.660 --> 14:37.360
And ribbon cables, 50-pin ribbon cables

14:37.360 --> 14:38.740
that we plugged into the hard drives,

14:38.740 --> 14:41.780
and you couldn't forget the terminator.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.100
Because if you didn't have a terminator,

14:43.100 --> 14:45.180
your SCSI signal would reflect off the end of the wire,

14:45.180 --> 14:47.380
and it would screw up your whole SCSI chain.

14:47.380 --> 14:50.040
And sometimes it'd come loose just because, screw you.

14:51.540 --> 14:53.120
And stuff would go haywire.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.160
And, you remember these?

14:57.160 --> 15:00.220
Seagate ST, what is it, 30, I don't even remember,

15:00.220 --> 15:02.100
31200 or something like that?

15:02.100 --> 15:04.460
Yeah, 31230N.

15:04.460 --> 15:06.060
This is a SCSI hard drive.

15:06.060 --> 15:07.460
Again, you can't really see it that well,

15:07.460 --> 15:09.640
but there's a jumper bank right there.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.940
We had to set jumpers on the hard drives

15:11.940 --> 15:14.400
to give them SCSI IDs.

15:14.400 --> 15:16.940
And if you got them wrong, you had a bad day.

15:19.140 --> 15:21.640
This hard drive that I've got up here,

15:21.640 --> 15:25.680
I remember buying one for a Novell server.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.980
It's 1.05 gigabyte.

15:30.980 --> 15:32.860
$2400?

15:34.560 --> 15:35.820
For one gigabyte.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.500
This is 128 gigabytes.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.540
Cost about, I don't know, 20 bucks,

15:43.540 --> 15:45.140
and I got it for free at a conference.

15:45.140 --> 15:48.140
And this has better throughput than that hard drive.

15:49.640 --> 15:53.240
I can put, in fact, I have on my desktop PC,

15:53.240 --> 15:58.180
I have a hard drive that's 4,000 times larger than this.

15:58.180 --> 15:59.820
And it cost me less than 200 bucks.

15:59.820 --> 16:03.520
So, again, it's been an incredible journey.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.020
Sound cards.

16:09.900 --> 16:11.860
Sound Blaster 16, baby.

16:11.860 --> 16:16.120
You had to, again, set jumpers for IRQ,

16:16.120 --> 16:19.560
IO ports, memory addresses, all that crazy stuff.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.360
And you had to understand all of those things

16:22.360 --> 16:27.360
because you oftentimes had to either compile the kernel

16:28.560 --> 16:29.640
with the correct settings for these things,

16:29.640 --> 16:31.600
or at least know what the settings were

16:31.600 --> 16:35.480
to set a config file or something like that.

16:35.480 --> 16:40.340
And don't forget, as I said, we started using modems.

16:40.340 --> 16:44.780
And yet again, we had to set jumpers

16:44.780 --> 16:47.720
to set what COM port it was emulating or whatever.

16:47.720 --> 16:50.680
But you'll notice on this one, this modem,

16:50.680 --> 16:54.060
this was a badass modem, this was a 14.4.

16:54.060 --> 16:56.020
This was some high speed back in the day.

16:56.020 --> 16:57.420
But there's no jumpers on there.

16:57.420 --> 16:58.260
You know why?

16:59.420 --> 17:00.760
It's a win modem.

17:01.900 --> 17:04.140
The spawn of Satan.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.960
Because it was all software configurable.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.980
And we didn't, a lot of times Linux

17:10.980 --> 17:12.800
just didn't have the drivers for win modems.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.540
So huge challenges there.

17:15.540 --> 17:17.580
And then there was the monitor.

17:19.540 --> 17:22.580
And the reason that I have smoke coming out of the monitor

17:23.720 --> 17:25.760
is that in the early days,

17:25.760 --> 17:27.980
does anyone remember XF86 config?

17:29.400 --> 17:32.060
Right, you would have to run XF86 config

17:32.060 --> 17:33.800
before you could start X.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.900
And you had to tell X,

17:36.900 --> 17:38.540
you had to generate a config file.

17:38.540 --> 17:40.000
You had to define the mode lines.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.540
You had to define the X and Y, start and stop.

17:42.540 --> 17:45.040
You had to define the refresh rate.

17:45.040 --> 17:46.640
You had to define all this kind of stuff.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.820
You could literally go in and tell the electron gun

17:49.820 --> 17:52.380
to shoot to the left or to the right or up or down

17:52.380 --> 17:55.460
and even to keystone and to do the in and out

17:55.460 --> 17:56.720
and all that stuff.

17:56.720 --> 18:00.080
And if you didn't pay attention to the warnings,

18:03.700 --> 18:05.920
you could get a 14 inch monitor

18:05.920 --> 18:07.760
that said it was good for 800 by 600 and go,

18:07.760 --> 18:09.860
I wonder if it'll do 1024 by 768.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.700
And XF86 config would go, yeah, sure, let's try it.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.580
Click, start X.

18:24.980 --> 18:25.820
Oh crap.

18:28.220 --> 18:30.760
So yeah, the early days were pretty crazy.

18:30.760 --> 18:35.760
Kids these days with their auto configuring PCI devices.

18:36.460 --> 18:37.300
Damn you.

18:39.660 --> 18:40.500
That's right.

18:41.440 --> 18:43.560
But yeah, things were really different.

18:43.560 --> 18:45.000
And in a lot of ways, honestly,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.980
I'm really glad I lived through the painful days.

18:47.980 --> 18:49.980
I'm really glad that I had to configure

18:49.980 --> 18:51.740
all these crazy things.

18:51.740 --> 18:53.680
I'm really glad that I had to walk uphill both ways

18:53.680 --> 18:57.420
in the snow to get to school because I learned a lot.

18:57.420 --> 18:58.780
I really did, I learned a lot.

18:58.780 --> 19:00.280
My first distro was Slackware.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.160
And that was challenging.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.960
It was really tough to get Slackware to play nice.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.320
And I'm glad that I did.

19:07.420 --> 19:11.060
And when I started, we had Usenet.

19:12.060 --> 19:13.340
We had Usenet.

19:13.340 --> 19:15.000
And maybe if you lived in a big city,

19:15.000 --> 19:16.400
there was a lug close by.

19:18.300 --> 19:22.200
You guys remember the comp.os.linux hierarchy?

19:22.200 --> 19:25.540
Comp.os.linux.misc was the place

19:25.540 --> 19:27.280
that you would go to ask questions.

19:27.280 --> 19:30.480
How many folks remember using Claws?

19:30.480 --> 19:35.480
Gnoos, yeah, Silfeed?

19:37.360 --> 19:40.420
For those of you who are younger than my IT career,

19:41.500 --> 19:44.300
these are old open source tools

19:44.300 --> 19:45.960
that we used to access Usenet.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.540
Usenet was sort of like a precursor

19:47.540 --> 19:51.640
to bulletin boards, I guess, or mailing lists.

19:51.640 --> 19:56.280
But so you would use Usenet

19:56.280 --> 19:59.380
and you could post questions and people would reply.

19:59.380 --> 20:01.680
And the thing that was amazing was

20:01.680 --> 20:03.340
I would see people replying

20:04.320 --> 20:08.260
whose names I saw scrolling by as the kernel booted.

20:09.620 --> 20:11.720
That was pretty amazing,

20:11.720 --> 20:14.600
that the people who were helping

20:14.600 --> 20:17.120
were literally the folks who were writing the code.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.900
And they were willing to help.

20:19.900 --> 20:23.360
And Usenet is where I started to understand

20:23.360 --> 20:26.000
what open source was really about.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.700
And I'll talk more about that in a little while.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.140
Mailing lists, this is funny.

20:29.140 --> 20:31.040
David, you're on this.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.180
This is the oldest archive that I could find

20:33.180 --> 20:36.080
for the Central Texas Linux Users Group mailing list.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.340
David and I are actually trading conversations

20:38.340 --> 20:40.520
back there for Fedora Core 4.

20:42.260 --> 20:43.820
So we're talking about that stuff.

20:43.820 --> 20:45.180
I couldn't find any older archives.

20:45.180 --> 20:49.220
I wanna say ct-lug lost a hard drive back in like 05

20:49.220 --> 20:51.420
and the archives went away.

20:51.420 --> 20:54.700
But so yeah, it was heady times.

20:54.700 --> 20:58.160
Just out of curiosity, how many folks are members of lugs?

20:59.840 --> 21:01.300
Not many.

21:01.300 --> 21:04.040
I'll talk more about that in a little while too.

21:04.040 --> 21:06.240
The early distros were crazy.

21:07.240 --> 21:11.320
Yggdrasil, yeah, Yggdrasil.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.460
Slackware is the oldest surviving

21:13.460 --> 21:15.120
and it's not just surviving, it's thriving.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.220
The oldest surviving distro is Slackware.

21:17.220 --> 21:19.660
Then you had Red Hat and SUSE and Debian.

21:19.660 --> 21:21.500
Mandrake, remember Mandrake Linux

21:21.500 --> 21:25.400
before it became Mandriva, before it died, I think.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.760
TAMU Linux, Texas A&M University, gig of Aggies.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.400
Whoop, yeah, sorry.

21:32.780 --> 21:36.680
So Mark Ewing was one of the computer science guys

21:36.680 --> 21:38.600
at Texas A&M University.

21:38.600 --> 21:41.580
He came up with, and that's TAMU Linux

21:41.580 --> 21:43.480
over there on the right-hand side.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.380
He developed the Tux logo.

21:45.380 --> 21:49.320
And I have actually communicated with him over the years

21:49.320 --> 21:50.860
because I've used his logo for a couple of things

21:50.860 --> 21:52.560
and I always pinged him and just said, is it cool?

21:52.560 --> 21:53.760
And he always responds back and says,

21:53.760 --> 21:55.260
please quit sending me these emails.

21:55.260 --> 21:57.000
I've already told everyone they can use it,

21:57.000 --> 22:00.740
but you know, I just wanna say, SLS.

22:00.740 --> 22:02.740
Remember SLS Linux?

22:02.740 --> 22:04.900
Yeah, that's old, I do.

22:06.440 --> 22:09.780
Now, so that's where we came from.

22:09.780 --> 22:12.380
Who were we back in the 90s?

22:13.540 --> 22:15.020
What do you see on this page?

22:16.840 --> 22:19.760
More importantly, what do you not see on this page?

22:19.760 --> 22:20.860
Oh, and this sucks, I'm sorry,

22:20.860 --> 22:22.360
the brightness is all washed out.

22:22.360 --> 22:25.560
Any chance we could turn off the front lights?

22:25.560 --> 22:27.700
If it's easily done, if we could turn off the front lights,

22:27.700 --> 22:29.260
that would be awesome.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.260
Because I think this is really important.

22:32.460 --> 22:36.100
They're all gray beards, like me.

22:36.100 --> 22:37.600
I have become.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.880
But more importantly, what do we not see here?

22:42.780 --> 22:45.180
Ooh, that wasn't quite what I meant, but I like it.

22:45.180 --> 22:50.180
More importantly, what do we not see?

22:50.760 --> 22:55.120
People of color, women, young people.

22:56.380 --> 22:57.900
That's a big problem, folks,

22:57.900 --> 23:00.220
and I'll talk more about that in a little while.

23:00.220 --> 23:02.960
So, what were we doing back in the day?

23:02.960 --> 23:06.300
Well, mostly web and edge of network type of stuff, right?

23:06.300 --> 23:10.400
We were doing DNS and DHCP and file services with NFS

23:10.400 --> 23:12.380
and Samba, anyone remember Samba?

23:12.380 --> 23:15.100
I freaking loved Samba.

23:15.100 --> 23:18.440
You know, print services, email services, stuff like that.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.820
I mean, kind of a cheap Unix replacement

23:21.820 --> 23:23.180
is really what we were.

23:24.580 --> 23:28.160
Why was Linux so successful, do you suppose?

23:28.160 --> 23:29.820
Is it because Linux was awesome

23:29.820 --> 23:32.820
and it worked right out of the box every time, everywhere,

23:32.820 --> 23:34.460
and was super high performance?

23:35.800 --> 23:39.000
No, because it really wasn't in the early days.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.440
But it was good enough.

23:42.440 --> 23:43.800
It was good enough.

23:43.800 --> 23:47.300
And it was free, as in beer, because at the time,

23:47.300 --> 23:50.700
myself included, most people didn't understand

23:50.700 --> 23:54.140
or really even care that much about free as in speech.

23:54.140 --> 23:56.680
And again, I'll talk about that in a little while.

23:56.680 --> 24:00.180
And people were passionate about it.

24:00.180 --> 24:02.380
People became really fired up.

24:02.380 --> 24:04.180
I was one of them, I've made a career

24:04.180 --> 24:05.580
out of working with Linux,

24:05.580 --> 24:08.860
and I'm insanely grateful to the community

24:08.860 --> 24:10.320
to be able to have done so.

24:10.320 --> 24:14.820
Do we remember the distro wars?

24:16.560 --> 24:17.400
Yeah.

24:18.640 --> 24:22.300
Tribalism at its best, right?

24:22.300 --> 24:25.640
You know, you can see the our blessed homeland

24:25.640 --> 24:28.100
versus those barbarous wastes.

24:28.100 --> 24:31.040
Our dear leader versus their savage tyrant.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.880
It was all about mine is better than yours

24:34.880 --> 24:36.180
and you ain't got mine.

24:36.180 --> 24:41.180
And it did some really, really shitty stuff.

24:44.100 --> 24:45.700
People would ask, what's the best distro?

24:45.700 --> 24:47.020
Which distro should I use?

24:47.020 --> 24:47.920
What's going on?

24:47.920 --> 24:50.140
Well, thank you very much for asking.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.740
Let me just tell ya.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.540
What's the best distro?

24:57.700 --> 24:58.880
Well, you want enterprise support

24:58.880 --> 24:59.940
and a really long life cycle?

24:59.940 --> 25:02.140
Well, clearly Red Hat Enterprise Linux

25:02.140 --> 25:03.580
is the best distro.

25:03.580 --> 25:05.820
You want enterprise support and maybe not as long,

25:05.820 --> 25:08.280
but really good community and really docs?

25:08.280 --> 25:12.680
Well, obviously LTS Ubuntu is the best distro.

25:12.680 --> 25:15.220
Do you want the latest and greatest packages,

25:15.220 --> 25:16.620
bleeding edge technology

25:16.620 --> 25:18.660
that's really, really close to upstream?

25:18.660 --> 25:22.620
Well, obviously Fedora is the best distro.

25:22.620 --> 25:24.100
Do you want a stable long-term release,

25:24.100 --> 25:26.160
but you don't wanna pay for it?

25:26.160 --> 25:30.700
Well, clearly CentOS is the best distro.

25:30.700 --> 25:32.540
Do you want an amazing desktop experience

25:32.540 --> 25:34.680
that just works, has all the multimedia,

25:34.680 --> 25:36.180
everything's fine and flashy

25:36.180 --> 25:38.440
and you just click next, next, next, and it's fine?

25:38.440 --> 25:42.020
Well, obviously Linux Mint is the best distro.

25:43.980 --> 25:45.460
Do you want a distro that's optimized

25:45.460 --> 25:48.420
for cloud computing and virtualization workloads?

25:48.420 --> 25:51.200
Well, clearly Amazon Linux is the best distro.

25:52.960 --> 25:55.420
Do you want a highly technical distribution

25:55.420 --> 25:59.960
for power users that is insanely configurable?

25:59.960 --> 26:02.960
Well, Gentoo is clearly the best distro,

26:02.960 --> 26:05.480
except, wait a minute,

26:05.480 --> 26:08.960
maybe Linux from scratch may make more sense.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.800
And you remember I was talking about the easy to use,

26:13.200 --> 26:16.600
maybe MX Linux or Monjaro.

26:16.600 --> 26:20.460
Maybe that might, hmm, you know what?

26:21.940 --> 26:24.140
You keep saying that word.

26:24.140 --> 26:29.140
I do not think it means what you think it means.

26:29.140 --> 26:32.740
Folks, adopting a distro like a religion is stupid.

26:34.240 --> 26:36.040
I've been guilty.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.240
I'm not saying I'm not stupid.

26:38.240 --> 26:39.540
I'm saying I've gotten enough scars

26:39.540 --> 26:40.980
that I don't do that anymore.

26:41.980 --> 26:46.960
Try a bunch of them, force yourself to learn them.

26:46.960 --> 26:51.320
Put whatever, put Ubuntu on your machine, exclusively.

26:51.320 --> 26:54.020
Don't dual boot, put it on and force yourself

26:54.020 --> 26:56.500
to live with it for a month or two.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.940
Then change over to Slackware, then change over to CentOS,

26:59.940 --> 27:03.940
then change over to Arch, then change, learn.

27:03.940 --> 27:08.440
Get good at it so that you can have informed decisions.

27:08.440 --> 27:10.940
At the end of the day, folks, it's a kernel,

27:10.940 --> 27:14.280
GLibc or similar, look into your utilities

27:14.280 --> 27:15.680
and a bunch of applications.

27:17.180 --> 27:20.320
The best distro is the one that does what you need

27:20.320 --> 27:24.020
at the best cost, you know?

27:24.020 --> 27:26.800
So I'm kind of done with that, that whole

27:26.800 --> 27:28.900
mine's better than yours thing.

27:28.900 --> 27:30.000
So where are we now?

27:31.160 --> 27:32.000
You know what?

27:32.960 --> 27:33.800
We've won.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.300
Linux has won.

27:37.300 --> 27:39.700
We're not winning, we've won.

27:39.700 --> 27:42.480
We are literally everywhere.

27:43.720 --> 27:44.940
The Linux kernel runs Android.

27:44.940 --> 27:47.040
How many folks use Android phones?

27:47.040 --> 27:49.380
Yep, okay, I mean, we're everywhere.

27:49.380 --> 27:54.380
The cloud, public clouds, are mostly built on Linux.

27:56.420 --> 27:58.900
And I don't mean just a bunch of Linux instances running,

27:58.900 --> 28:01.800
I mean the server infrastructure is running Linux,

28:01.800 --> 28:04.100
except for Microsoft, but you know, whatever.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.900
Containers, containerization, the new hotness, right?

28:07.900 --> 28:09.340
This is all cool stuff.

28:09.340 --> 28:12.500
Containers are just Linux processes.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.400
Serverless isn't.

28:15.740 --> 28:17.420
It's running on Linux.

28:17.420 --> 28:20.140
It's running on a server,

28:20.140 --> 28:22.120
you just don't have to mess with it.

28:23.860 --> 28:27.780
Always remember, there is no cloud.

28:27.780 --> 28:30.320
There's just somebody else's computers.

28:32.160 --> 28:36.200
So Linux is being used to track and manage

28:36.200 --> 28:38.360
the planes over US airspace.

28:38.360 --> 28:42.800
8,000 to 10,000 planes at any given time over US airspace,

28:42.800 --> 28:45.380
they're being tracked by a cluster of Linux machines.

28:45.380 --> 28:48.040
I fly a lot.

28:48.040 --> 28:51.680
To me, ain't much more mission critical than that.

28:51.680 --> 28:54.380
You know, so we're there.

28:54.380 --> 28:56.560
Linux powers the US Bradley fighting vehicle

28:56.560 --> 28:58.320
and the Zumwalt class destroyer.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.720
I'm really mixed about that.

29:00.820 --> 29:03.720
I mean, honestly, I'm really mixed about that.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.500
My hope is that they're never used,

29:05.500 --> 29:07.200
that there are never shots fired in anger,

29:07.200 --> 29:08.100
but I know better.

29:09.400 --> 29:12.160
If they are, I am confident in our troops

29:12.160 --> 29:13.240
and that technology.

29:13.240 --> 29:15.900
Just out of curiosity, how many folks in here are millennials?

29:18.700 --> 29:21.580
No, no, no, I'm not gonna bust on you guys.

29:21.580 --> 29:24.020
I'm gonna quote Admiral McRaven,

29:24.020 --> 29:27.080
who was the head of Navy Special Forces,

29:27.080 --> 29:30.460
think Navy SEALs, and he said,

29:30.460 --> 29:32.520
people talk smack about millennials,

29:32.520 --> 29:33.980
they say that they're soft,

29:33.980 --> 29:37.700
they've never seen them in a firefight in Afghanistan.

29:38.820 --> 29:42.140
So even though I joke a lot about being a gray beard,

29:42.140 --> 29:44.940
and I do a lot of jokes about get off of my lawn,

29:44.940 --> 29:48.380
I'm real happy with the next generation of folks in IT.

29:48.380 --> 29:50.580
I'm really impressed by what I see.

29:52.340 --> 29:57.340
And the final, I think most important proof that we've won,

29:58.120 --> 30:02.120
IBM is spending $34 billion

30:03.980 --> 30:05.860
for legitimacy in the Linux game.

30:06.820 --> 30:10.320
It's the biggest software acquisition that's ever happened.

30:10.320 --> 30:13.160
And everybody, every major tech company out there

30:13.160 --> 30:15.160
is contributing to open source.

30:15.160 --> 30:18.840
Google, Intel, Microsoft, Red Hat, IBM, AMD, SUSE,

30:18.840 --> 30:20.840
many, many, many, many, many, many more.

30:22.900 --> 30:26.080
Linux runs about 90% of the public cloud.

30:26.080 --> 30:29.680
Linux runs about 82% of the world's smartphones.

30:29.680 --> 30:33.320
About 62% of the embedded market is Linux.

30:33.320 --> 30:37.420
About 99% of the supercomputer market is Linux.

30:37.420 --> 30:41.460
So we've won, and that's a pretty cool place to be.

30:41.460 --> 30:44.940
Linux developers are so mainstream.

30:47.680 --> 30:48.900
Now, like I said earlier,

30:48.900 --> 30:50.440
I asked how many folks are members of Lugs,

30:50.440 --> 30:52.580
and there's a pretty small group.

30:52.580 --> 30:56.740
And just out of curiosity, for those who are in Lugs,

30:56.740 --> 30:58.180
growing or shrinking?

31:00.660 --> 31:02.780
Shrunk and then it's growing again.

31:02.780 --> 31:05.660
I used to worry a lot about shrinking Lugs.

31:05.660 --> 31:08.660
It used to really worry me, but then it hit me.

31:14.700 --> 31:17.000
We used to have to band together for support.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.980
We needed each other because there were so few of us,

31:20.980 --> 31:24.140
there were so few resources that we got together

31:24.140 --> 31:26.040
and we formed tribes in a good way.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.320
Not in the negative tribalism I was talking about earlier,

31:28.320 --> 31:31.620
but we formed tribes and that was a good thing.

31:31.620 --> 31:36.320
We're not rare anymore, we're everywhere, right?

31:36.320 --> 31:38.020
So we don't have the need.

31:38.020 --> 31:40.460
It's awesome to be at Texas Linux Fest.

31:40.460 --> 31:42.200
It's amazing to see all of you here.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.120
And I love that I'm a part of this community,

31:44.120 --> 31:47.260
and I love that you're a part of the community with me,

31:47.260 --> 31:49.660
but we're not as isolated as we once were.

31:50.900 --> 31:53.640
So there's not so much of a need for Lugs anymore,

31:54.540 --> 31:58.040
which kind of makes me sad, but I kind of understand it.

31:58.040 --> 32:00.320
And the other thing that is changing,

32:00.320 --> 32:02.380
although not fast enough,

32:02.380 --> 32:06.960
this is a picture from Flock to Fedora, it's 2017, I think.

32:06.960 --> 32:08.560
And again, I'm sorry that the lights are bright

32:08.560 --> 32:09.760
and you kind of can't see it,

32:09.760 --> 32:13.220
but there's a really, really cool thing that I see here.

32:14.600 --> 32:18.160
There are people of color, there are women,

32:18.160 --> 32:20.160
there are folks with disabilities.

32:20.160 --> 32:23.200
We are getting more inclusive.

32:23.200 --> 32:26.280
We're not there yet, but we're getting more inclusive.

32:26.280 --> 32:29.900
We're getting more inclusive, and that is phenomenal.

32:29.900 --> 32:31.740
There's still a lot of room for improvement

32:31.740 --> 32:32.740
in diversity and inclusion,

32:32.740 --> 32:35.420
and I think that we need to pay attention to that.

32:36.440 --> 32:39.360
And I want to make something really clear.

32:39.360 --> 32:42.360
Diversity is inviting someone to the dance.

32:43.360 --> 32:44.320
And I talk to folks and they're like,

32:44.320 --> 32:45.720
oh, no, no, we work for diversity.

32:45.720 --> 32:47.320
We have hiring requirements that, you know,

32:47.320 --> 32:50.000
X percentage of people who come in are people of color,

32:50.000 --> 32:53.360
or women, or disabled, or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

32:53.360 --> 32:55.300
Okay, that's fine.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.940
Inclusion is asking them to dance.

32:59.700 --> 33:02.040
Just because you have hired, you know,

33:02.040 --> 33:05.180
X percentage of whatever group doesn't mean

33:05.180 --> 33:07.840
that you are including them in your business.

33:07.840 --> 33:10.180
There are way too many examples.

33:10.180 --> 33:12.740
You can go to Reddit and find example after example

33:12.740 --> 33:16.080
after example of brogrammer culture,

33:16.080 --> 33:20.960
of token diversity, and more stories about discrimination

33:20.960 --> 33:24.060
and outright harassment than you could shake a stick at.

33:24.060 --> 33:29.080
Don't be that guy, or girl.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.280
There are a ton of organizations out there

33:33.280 --> 33:36.840
that really work hard to do diversity in tech.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.740
There's Out in Tech for the LGBT community,

33:39.740 --> 33:41.880
People of Color in IT, Chick Tech,

33:41.880 --> 33:43.560
which is an organization that I've done

33:43.560 --> 33:45.860
some volunteer work with in Austin and I love,

33:45.860 --> 33:47.920
Brown Girls in Tech, Girls Who Code,

33:47.920 --> 33:52.920
Trans Tech Social, and TGI Tech for kids who code.

33:52.920 --> 33:57.920
And it's not just about LGBT, or women,

34:00.360 --> 34:03.200
or it's also about disabilities, right?

34:03.200 --> 34:04.800
And disabilities don't just mean

34:04.800 --> 34:07.700
the ones that you can see, okay?

34:07.700 --> 34:10.740
Neurodiversity is a really important topic.

34:10.740 --> 34:13.040
There are a lot of folks who are terrified

34:13.040 --> 34:17.340
to talk about things like mental health issues in tech,

34:17.340 --> 34:18.920
right?

34:18.920 --> 34:23.620
I have bipolar folks, it's scary to say that,

34:24.660 --> 34:28.860
but it's important to break down the barriers.

34:28.860 --> 34:31.960
Mine's controlled by medication, thank God,

34:31.960 --> 34:36.960
but people need to feel safe in tech.

34:38.100 --> 34:39.760
And we as a community have done a phenomenal job

34:39.760 --> 34:42.300
in the past of bringing people in and including them.

34:42.300 --> 34:43.600
Let's extend that.

34:45.640 --> 34:47.580
So where are we going?

34:47.580 --> 34:50.240
Man, I've given up on peering at the crystal ball.

34:50.240 --> 34:52.640
How many folks go back and read the predictions

34:52.640 --> 34:55.880
from the previous December every year?

34:55.880 --> 34:58.820
And right, that's the reaction, belly laugh.

35:00.860 --> 35:03.700
But there are some things that are kind of obvious.

35:04.960 --> 35:08.940
Intel actually went down last quarter in sales,

35:08.940 --> 35:10.300
in data center sales.

35:10.300 --> 35:15.300
That is like a category 15 hurricane in the industry.

35:15.300 --> 35:18.200
I mean, people, Intel just doesn't miss quarters,

35:18.200 --> 35:19.640
so that's pretty crazy.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.220
But the server virtualization market

35:22.220 --> 35:24.320
is still expecting to grow.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.620
So what does that say?

35:26.660 --> 35:31.020
Public cloud, public cloud is taking over the universe.

35:31.020 --> 35:33.100
People are not building private data centers

35:33.100 --> 35:35.600
at anywhere near the rate that they used to.

35:36.800 --> 35:40.400
And if you look at, this is actually energy absorption,

35:40.400 --> 35:45.400
hmm, what's in Northern Virginia?

35:47.240 --> 35:50.840
Well, yeah, yeah, NSA, but over and above that,

35:50.840 --> 35:53.340
it's the US East region for AWS.

35:55.040 --> 35:58.020
And if you look at cloud as a percentage

35:58.020 --> 36:02.360
of that absorption, look at how much of the megawatts

36:02.360 --> 36:06.160
that are being absorbed are being done by cloud providers.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.460
Cloud is eating the universe.

36:08.460 --> 36:11.060
And look at the data centers that are under construction.

36:11.060 --> 36:13.140
That was in 2018.

36:13.140 --> 36:16.940
So it's all moving towards cloud.

36:16.940 --> 36:21.200
And this kind of sucks, but the days of the Linux admin

36:21.200 --> 36:22.780
are mostly gone.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.840
If you go to your favorite job site

36:26.920 --> 36:29.220
and do a search for Linux admin,

36:29.220 --> 36:31.720
I went to LinkedIn jobs and put in Austin

36:31.720 --> 36:34.720
and did Linux admin, and you can see,

36:34.720 --> 36:37.820
there were a few results, man, 46 results.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.320
If I was looking for a Linux admin job,

36:39.320 --> 36:41.220
I would call that a fairly target rich environment.

36:41.220 --> 36:43.100
That's all right, I like that.

36:43.100 --> 36:48.440
But then I put in cloud architect, 245.

36:50.300 --> 36:51.440
Then I backed off and I said,

36:51.440 --> 36:53.440
well, just give me all Linux in Austin.

36:53.440 --> 36:54.740
And I was like, man, that's pretty cool.

36:54.740 --> 36:56.680
1500 results for Linux.

36:56.680 --> 37:00.580
That's developers, admins, sales, whatever.

37:00.580 --> 37:05.220
And then I did the same thing for cloud, 4,000,

37:05.220 --> 37:07.680
just in Austin.

37:07.680 --> 37:12.160
In Dallas, in the DFW Metroplex, it's more by a bunch.

37:14.420 --> 37:17.200
Employers expect cloud competency.

37:19.300 --> 37:23.860
But Linux is a huge underlying component of that.

37:23.860 --> 37:27.580
So I'm not at all saying, oh, screw Linux, go cloud.

37:27.580 --> 37:31.540
No, what I'm saying is you have an advantage right now.

37:32.880 --> 37:36.080
But you need to understand all the things that Linux does,

37:36.080 --> 37:37.920
sort of architecturally, right?

37:37.920 --> 37:40.420
You need to actually understand networking

37:40.420 --> 37:43.660
because cloud is very much about networking,

37:43.660 --> 37:45.380
setting up virtual private clouds

37:45.380 --> 37:47.720
and subnets and things like that.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.620
You need to understand storage.

37:49.620 --> 37:51.900
And I mean, block storage.

37:51.900 --> 37:55.560
I mean, file storage, like NFS and Gluster

37:55.560 --> 37:57.960
and things like that, and also object storage.

37:57.960 --> 37:59.680
You need to understand those technologies.

37:59.680 --> 38:03.080
Those are all built on Linux, folks, but understand them.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.580
You need to understand application services

38:05.580 --> 38:07.240
because the days of somebody

38:07.240 --> 38:10.920
who just does Linux are gone.

38:10.920 --> 38:12.780
You need to, at the very least,

38:12.780 --> 38:15.880
understand the concepts of programming

38:15.880 --> 38:17.380
and software development.

38:17.380 --> 38:21.460
I will never be a good developer.

38:22.660 --> 38:25.100
I mean, that's a whole other career path, honestly.

38:25.100 --> 38:28.140
And this old dog doesn't wanna learn those new tricks,

38:28.140 --> 38:30.140
if I'm being really blunt.

38:30.140 --> 38:32.540
But I understand enough about software development

38:32.540 --> 38:34.480
that I can have intelligent conversations.

38:34.480 --> 38:37.740
Containerization is taking over the universe.

38:37.740 --> 38:39.880
Go see David Sarine's story on,

38:39.880 --> 38:43.980
or presentation on containerization later on.

38:43.980 --> 38:46.820
And so you need to understand how containers work,

38:46.820 --> 38:48.680
and you need to understand, let me go back one.

38:48.680 --> 38:50.420
You need to understand orchestration.

38:50.420 --> 38:52.720
So for Kubernetes and things like that,

38:52.720 --> 38:55.020
you need to at least be understanding how it works

38:55.020 --> 38:57.460
and preferably learn how to do it.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.360
You need to learn enough about code

38:59.360 --> 39:01.600
to be able to speak intelligently about it.

39:01.600 --> 39:06.620
And everything should be infrastructure as code.

39:07.820 --> 39:09.220
Everything should be automated.

39:09.220 --> 39:11.280
If you are SSH-ing into machines

39:11.280 --> 39:15.660
and doing bespoke one-off stuff, you're doing it wrong.

39:18.860 --> 39:20.520
And security.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.920
Did I mention security?

39:23.260 --> 39:25.500
You really need to understand security.

39:26.860 --> 39:28.940
I think that we're going to see

39:28.940 --> 39:31.040
a lot more special purpose distros.

39:31.040 --> 39:33.680
Things like what Core OS has done,

39:33.680 --> 39:36.740
Atomic did before that went away,

39:36.740 --> 39:38.220
Photon OS, things like that.

39:38.220 --> 39:41.480
So I think you're going to see special purpose distros.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.680
I think that that's coming.

39:43.680 --> 39:46.020
Fedora and RHEL are doing some really cool things

39:46.020 --> 39:49.120
around modularity, having a very slow-moving core

39:49.120 --> 39:51.660
but very rapid-moving app streams.

39:51.660 --> 39:53.160
That's neat technology.

39:53.160 --> 39:55.900
I think you're going to see a lot more around that.

39:55.900 --> 39:59.600
I will say, and this irritates me,

39:59.600 --> 40:02.240
be aware of what I call cloud washing.

40:03.480 --> 40:05.840
Doing the same thing that you do in a data center

40:05.840 --> 40:09.120
except virtualizing it in Amazon or Azure

40:09.120 --> 40:12.020
or Google Cloud Engine or Rackspace is fine.

40:12.020 --> 40:15.880
There is a place for it, but it's not cloud.

40:15.880 --> 40:17.820
That's just hosting, okay?

40:17.820 --> 40:18.860
Be aware of that.

40:20.020 --> 40:22.220
And don't let yourself go down the path of,

40:22.220 --> 40:23.960
oh no, I still do infrastructure stuff

40:23.960 --> 40:25.800
but I'm calling it cloud, and then all of a sudden

40:25.800 --> 40:29.600
you're unemployable because you don't know cloud.

40:31.260 --> 40:34.200
Because of all of the changes that I mentioned,

40:34.200 --> 40:36.640
I think that the Linux community is morphing and blending,

40:36.640 --> 40:39.480
and I think that that is a very, very good thing.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.940
Meetups and lugs and things like that

40:42.940 --> 40:45.140
are amazing ways to cross-pollinate

40:45.140 --> 40:47.280
the ability to go to a Kubernetes meetup,

40:47.280 --> 40:49.420
the ability to go to a containerization meetup,

40:49.420 --> 40:51.380
the ability to go to a Python meetup

40:51.380 --> 40:53.260
is a great way to cross-pollinate,

40:53.260 --> 40:55.760
learn additional things, and to grow.

40:55.760 --> 40:59.760
And I think that we have the ability to do good things

40:59.760 --> 41:01.860
on an even broader scale.

41:01.860 --> 41:04.500
The most proud that I have ever been

41:04.500 --> 41:06.140
to be a part of this community

41:06.140 --> 41:08.100
has when I've gone to events

41:08.100 --> 41:12.240
and I've seen things like this girl in Bogota, Colombia

41:12.240 --> 41:14.080
who was born without an arm,

41:14.080 --> 41:17.020
there's no way her family could afford a prosthetic.

41:17.020 --> 41:18.620
So a dude with a Red Hat machine,

41:18.620 --> 41:20.280
a Fedora machine actually,

41:20.280 --> 41:24.180
and 3D printing software, open source 3D printing software,

41:24.180 --> 41:28.260
and some donated materials built her a prosthetic arm.

41:29.760 --> 41:33.160
And he does that for kids all throughout Colombia.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.740
One laptop per child,

41:36.740 --> 41:38.460
that is one of the most amazing things.

41:38.460 --> 41:40.040
It wasn't ultimately successful,

41:40.040 --> 41:44.000
but it did do a lot of good and drive down

41:44.000 --> 41:48.120
the costs for computing for underprivileged kids.

41:48.120 --> 41:49.880
We have to remember, folks,

41:49.880 --> 41:53.820
that that which has been given freely to us,

41:53.820 --> 41:55.120
we need to pass along.

41:55.120 --> 41:57.700
We have a responsibility.

41:57.700 --> 41:59.640
I'm here because I have a responsibility

41:59.640 --> 42:01.700
to those of you who have come behind me.

42:01.700 --> 42:06.100
I hope that you will use your experience

42:06.100 --> 42:09.100
and take responsibility for the folks who come after you.

42:09.100 --> 42:13.080
We have to empower folks coming into technology.

42:13.080 --> 42:14.880
We have to enrich lives.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.840
We have to make things better.

42:16.840 --> 42:18.780
We have to include,

42:21.480 --> 42:24.320
and I think that will make the world a better place.

42:24.320 --> 42:26.360
Thank you very much for having me today,

42:26.360 --> 42:27.860
and enjoy the rest of the conference.

42:27.860 --> 42:47.880
And enjoy the rest of the conference.
