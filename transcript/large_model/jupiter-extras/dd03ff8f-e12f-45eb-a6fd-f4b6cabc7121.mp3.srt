00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,680
Well, hello, everyone. Welcome back to Brunch with Brent. I'm super excited today. I'm tempted

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,640
to say extra excited today to be joined by Peter Adams. Peter, how are you doing?

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,960
I'm doing great, man. Thanks for having me. Super excited to chat with you.

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,960
Great. Welcome. Welcome to Brunch. I am extra excited, like I was saying, to have you join

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:38,100
me for this conversation. You're bringing together two of my very deep passions. One

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:45,260
is open source technologies and ideas, and the other one is photography. And of course,

7
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,480
we're going to dive into how that comes into your life. You know, I'm just talking about

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,880
those two juxtapositions, and it's making me smile like crazy. So, thank you for being

9
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:00,920
the embodiment of that excitement.

10
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,480
Happy to embody that. Two of my favorite things as well, so.

11
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:10,800
Yeah, which is really cool. And the way I discovered some of your work was that Cheese,

12
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,080
one of our friends and host at Jupiter Broadcasting, he mentioned one of your projects, which was

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,120
the Faces of Open Source, which is a photography project that you're doing and have been doing

14
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,800
for a while. Could you tell us a little bit about that?

15
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:35,120
So I started that project back in 2014, 2015. And it's a portrait project, just basically

16
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:41,520
photographing and exploring the open source community, people in the open source community.

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:49,040
And my whole feeling was that open source often kind of gets relegated to these bizarro

18
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,280
program names or acronyms.

19
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,080
There are a few of those, right?

20
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:01,920
Yeah, there's a couple million acronyms in the open source world. But finding the faces

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,320
of the people and bringing a human element and really sort of seeing the community visually

22
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,400
is not something that's super easy to do. It's super easy to browse GitHub pages. It's

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:18,040
super easy to get on a mailing list. It's very hard to put a face with a name. And as

24
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:26,280
a photographer, that really bugged me. So I just dove in and started doing portraits

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:35,860
of notable and unsung faces in the open source community. Some people I sought out are fairly

26
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:44,320
well known, but many of them are not. Many of them are new to open source. Many of them

27
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,120
have played a critical role but have been a little bit more unsung in the history books.

28
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,960
And so I really wanted to sort of create a collection that was representative of the

29
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:05,600
community and that people could see who the faces that are creating this amazing community

30
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:12,800
and this amazing software, who they were. And so I started that in 2015 and we're up

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,640
over 100 portraits at this point. I think it's 120 something.

32
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:25,720
What a wonderful feat. 100 portraits for any professional photographer who's really put

33
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,360
their heart into a single portrait. Doing 100 is no small thing.

34
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:38,740
Yeah. It's been a great journey and it's a project that I have to fit in between other

35
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:44,280
work and other projects. And sometimes I get lucky and I'll go to a conference and there's

36
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,620
a whole bunch of people that I'm wanting to photograph that are at that conference. But

37
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:55,440
oftentimes it's me loading the car and showing up at somebody's backyard or somebody's living

38
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,680
room or somebody's front yard.

39
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
Really?

40
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:07,440
Yeah. Or office, cram all the gear into a conference room and just kind of go from there.

41
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,600
And that's been the hardest part of the project is just the logistics of getting people scheduled

42
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:20,200
because there's a good concentration of people in California where I am, but a lot of people

43
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:25,080
are all over the map. And I get to New York a lot and we've done a lot of shoots in New

44
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:32,280
York as well for people. But I have to try to time when people are traveling to the US,

45
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,660
maybe they're going to be in the same city I'm going to be in, or maybe I can extend

46
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,680
a trip on another project to photograph them for this project. So the logistics part has

47
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:51,040
really been the hardest part of getting to 120 plus people at this point. And last year

48
00:04:51,040 --> 00:05:00,480
we did I think 18 or 19, the year before that I did 30. So it really depends kind of on

49
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,680
how logistics and schedules kind of align, how many more people we had.

50
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,000
And do you have someone kind of helping you both on the logistics end, connecting with

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,280
people and also on site when you're actually taking the photographs?

52
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:24,320
Well on site, if I can, I'll have an assistant with me, but oftentimes these are fairly simple

53
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,520
shoots and it's just me and a car full of equipment. If we're shooting in a studio,

54
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:39,120
I'll tend to have an assistant help with set up or things like that. But it's really just

55
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,760
me. I mean, logistically I'm approaching people, reaching out, writing people. Everybody gets

56
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:51,400
a random email from this random photographer saying he's doing a project.

57
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,560
But actually at this point, a lot of participants have been really great because they're referring

58
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,580
me to other people or they've been really gracious with their time and they've kind

59
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:06,560
of opened their Rolodex. So they make introductions to other people in the community on my behalf.

60
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,680
And that's been really helpful and really, really amazing that people are willing to

61
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,800
do that and see the project grow and be successful through those introductions.

62
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,540
It has been so cool for me to see some of these portraits. I've mostly taken them in

63
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:31,480
from your website and it's true what you're saying. We know maybe a handful of popular

64
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,780
faces, the Linuses and such, but there are so many sort of intriguing looking people

65
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:43,600
there that you just kind of want to click on and learn their story as well. I have really

66
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:51,440
appreciated that connection of the visual and the sort of people side of things connected

67
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,100
with the story where you're a little bit more familiar with the code they wrote or the project

68
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,280
they worked on for decades or something like that. And has it kind of surprised you sometimes

69
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,840
when you get to meet some of these people? Like, oh, they're not the image that you may

70
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,320
have made in your mind because we all do. Or how has that experience been sort of meeting

71
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,320
all these people?

72
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,160
I mean, the experience of meeting everybody has been amazing. It's been phenomenal. Just

73
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:25,000
being able to spend time. I mean, sometimes I get an hour with somebody. Sometimes I only

74
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,700
get a few minutes with somebody. But all the times I do, before every shoot, I do my research

75
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:40,800
and I get online and I read extensively about what they've done and their history and their

76
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,760
background and if they've done any other interviews. So I research, I kind of know something about

77
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:54,880
the person, at least their public persona by the time they show up on my set. But you

78
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,280
never really can get a handle on somebody's personality until they're in front of your

79
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:07,320
camera and you're face to face. And in some cases, yeah, I've been pleasantly surprised,

80
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:16,880
you know, 99% of the time, you know, a couple of curve balls here and there. But for the

81
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,000
most time, everybody in this community has been really wonderful and really gracious

82
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,280
with their time and really excited to participate in a project like this. And I think that,

83
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,120
you know, at this point with it going on for a number of years now, I will get, you know,

84
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,240
I will get notes, you know, from past participants that have been following, you know, the project

85
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,360
for a few years or people that have just, you know, have seen it kind of evolve over

86
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:50,640
the years. And people have been really encouraging, you know, encouraging me to keep going and

87
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,480
are really appreciative that there's a documentation of this community because there really hasn't

88
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,520
been. And that was something that was so fascinating to me when I was doing the research on, you

89
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,400
know, on this project was that this is such an important thing. Open source is such an

90
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:14,120
important phenomenon. And there's just, there's very little photographic documentation of

91
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,120
the people, you know, that have created this. I mean, you know, there's, there's tons of

92
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:26,040
photos of Tim Berners-Lee and Vint Cerf and, you know, all, you know, the, the, the mega,

93
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:31,800
you know, stars of, of the, of the, you know, internet and the web and, you know, these,

94
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,080
these massive, you know, projects. Of course. And Linus has a lot of photos. There's actually

95
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,440
a funny story about Linus when I photographed him.

96
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,200
Well, I like funny stories. I'll never forget it because, you know, I

97
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,400
was, you know, I was concerned, you know, Linus is, you know, you know, Linus is Linus.

98
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:55,360
He's larger, larger than life figure in the, in the community and, and, and confrontational

99
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,160
at the same time, you know, or controversial, I should say, maybe confrontational on, on

100
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,200
mailing lists, but, you know, slightly controversial. And I just, you know, I had never met him

101
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,920
before and, you know, I didn't, I didn't really, you know, how sensitive he was going to be

102
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,600
to, to be photographed, but he agreed, you know, very, very quickly and was very, was

103
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:20,600
very happy and accommodating, you know, for, for our sitting. And, you know, at the end

104
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,440
I make everybody sign a, sign a release, you know, a photo release as I'm sure you do when

105
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,120
you do your shoots. You know, I asked him if he had any issue signing that and his,

106
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:40,840
his, his note, his, his response to me was, have you seen the pictures of me on the internet?

107
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:46,020
And I was like, oh man, that's so, it's, it's so refreshing that, you know, most people

108
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:52,560
are so concerned with, with images and their photography is being used. And, you know,

109
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,320
I had done the photo research of him and, you know, there's, there's, you can just go

110
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,480
to Google images and see some, some pretty funny pictures of him, you know, giving the

111
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,920
finger to people and all sorts of stuff. I mean, it's, but he was super accommodating

112
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,240
and, and really, really generous with his time at a busy conference, you know, to take,

113
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,960
take the time and do a sitting with me. So that was, that was really fun.

114
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,600
Yeah. I think as, as you certainly know, since you've been doing photography for a long while,

115
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,840
and I certainly know cause I am a professional photographer as well. There's this real opportunity

116
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:33,520
when you get to do a portrait of someone it ends up, you know, if no one's ever had a

117
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:41,480
professional portrait done it's quite an intimate experience. And if you're with a great photographer,

118
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,640
they will make that intimate experience a positive thing, you know, make you feel the

119
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:55,320
most comfortable you possibly can. And that can lead to some really fast connections,

120
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,360
some really deep connections as well within, you know, five, 10, 15 minutes. So I imagine

121
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:09,380
for you and, and maybe even for those you're photographing that it's kind of nice to have

122
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,480
some of those discussions, you know, at a busy conference, but you're, you're, you're

123
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,840
going away into, I'm assuming a room or something like that and just having a bit of a breather

124
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,200
and a, and a really important connection. So has that been a nice portion of it, of

125
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,480
it for you, just like having that intimate time with some of these people?

126
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh yeah. I mean, and, and what an honor to be able to get that. I mean, you know, most

127
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,680
of these people are on planes, you know, 24 seven and you know, between projects and their

128
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,000
day job and then, you know, the conference circuit. I mean, the life of an open source

129
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,760
advocate is, is quite, is quite busy actually. It's what I've learned. You know, I never

130
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,080
know, you know, some, some people it's taken me years to schedule. We've literally, I have

131
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:02,300
email threads, you know, that go for multiple years trying to find the overlap and schedules

132
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,720
and you know, trying to get somebody to be in the same place that I'm going to be or

133
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,040
for me to be in the same place they're going to be. And it's, it's very difficult. So when

134
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,760
I do get them in front of the camera, you're, you're absolutely right. It is an intimate

135
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,520
thing. And I think most people have not had their portrait done before. And I always ask

136
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,600
people when I photograph them, if they've had their portrait taken before, you know,

137
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,940
not like a, not a corporate headshot type portrait, but like, have they ever really

138
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:35,040
been in a portrait sitting? And, and it's, it's very rare for somebody to have had that

139
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,640
experience. And I think, you know, as you know, it takes a little while to get past

140
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,680
the, you know, the discomfort of being in front of a camera. And my sets tend to be,

141
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,420
you know, pretty elaborate. I mean, if we're shooting in a, in a studio, you know, it's

142
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:57,040
a full on photo studio and you know, these, these are, these are all portraits on white.

143
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
So it's, you know,

144
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,920
So you're shooting with more than one light sort of thing.

145
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:07,240
Yeah. It's, it's six lights and five C stands and flags and, you know, it's a whole, it's

146
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:13,920
a, it's an involved, it's an involved lighting setup to do these portraits. So, you know,

147
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,360
I think, and some people have never been on, you know, professional photo shoot before

148
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,220
they've ever been on set before. So, you know, it takes a little while to try to, you know,

149
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,840
get people into the zone and, and have them settle.

150
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,640
Yeah. That setup alone can be intimidating, right?

151
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:33,160
Yeah. It's just, you know, it's, it's, it's a lot for somebody to just walk into if they've

152
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,880
never, if they've never experienced it before. But then, you know, you know, then people,

153
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,600
you know, typically, you know, relax and, and you find, you find the rhythm and you

154
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,240
find the flow and, and you develop the connection and, and the photos come from that.

155
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:55,400
Well, you know, you made me smile and laugh actually when we first connected on the phone

156
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,680
to set up this conversation because one of the first things you did, and I bet you didn't

157
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,840
even consciously realize you did this. But one of the first things you did was ask me

158
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:13,000
about five to seven questions about me, just to kind of, you know, we're developing a connection,

159
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,160
which is important, but I was like, ah ha, this is exactly what I do to other people

160
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,480
when I'm, you know, setting them up for a portrait or, but that's just become my personality

161
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,480
is I've become really curious about people. And you were doing that to me. And I was like,

162
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,920
oh, I see where two photographers in the same room here.

163
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,520
It's like, if people are going to listen to this and like, I didn't get one answer on

164
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,680
either of them because they were so busy asking each other questions. No, that's just what

165
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,160
we have to do. I mean, that's, that's how you learn. I mean, I think, I mean, for me,

166
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,800
at least that's why, that's why I pick up the camera, you know, is to have that experience

167
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:53,600
to, to connect with somebody, to learn something about another person and, and to have that

168
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,440
connection. And of course the art that comes out of it is, is very satisfying, but the

169
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,640
process of getting to that art and learning about the person and learning about their

170
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:10,040
experiences is, you know, I think that's why a lot of people become photographers because

171
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,880
that's what they, that's what they want to be doing with their life. They want to be

172
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,920
learning in a continual, continually learning essentially.

173
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,280
You're describing me right there.

174
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,680
Yeah, exactly. I know it.

175
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:27,320
And photography certainly for me, and I imagine for you as well, has allowed me to spend time

176
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,320
in environments that otherwise I would never ever have access to. Right? Like for instance,

177
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,220
for you, this project is allowing you access to people you would likely otherwise never

178
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,720
talk to in, in a hundred years. Right?

179
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Totally.

180
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:49,440
There's something about photography's ability to connect people and allow you to experience

181
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,120
other people's lives in a deep, meaningful way for an afternoon or, you know, a few minutes

182
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,400
even. That is one of the most exciting things to me.

183
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:05,560
Yeah. It's, it's definitely a passport, you know, that a, a, a secret kind of passport

184
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:11,720
that, you know, not everybody has and, you know, it gives you that entree, you know,

185
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:18,400
just into these experiences that you're looking to have or you're looking to, you know, get

186
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,800
access to. And it's amazing, you know, I, you know, I do a lot of personal projects

187
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:30,360
and I'm always shocked, you know, when I come up with an idea for a personal project, you

188
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:36,440
know, like, like faces of open source or another one of my projects. And, you know, when you're

189
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,080
first doing the research, you're always thinking to yourself, Oh man, am I, am I, is this ever

190
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,960
going to happen? Is, is, is anyone ever going to say yes to this project? Are they really

191
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,720
going to let me in there with my camera to do X, Y, and Z? And I always think, you know,

192
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,000
there's no way it's never going to happen. And then you write the email and somebody

193
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,840
comes back and they're like, yeah, yeah, I'll do that. Or yeah, I'll give you that access.

194
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,420
And it's amazing how many, how welcoming people are. Um, you know, with the right project

195
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:12,700
in the right context, um, the camera is really a sort of a passport into, into these other

196
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,000
worlds and situations.

197
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,800
And yet with that passport comes a lot of responsibility, right? If you're given this

198
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:24,420
access and you kind of don't respect it, that does a real disservice to everyone. And so

199
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:30,560
I feel like you, you kind of take on this really important role in, in nurturing the

200
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:36,260
people you're also running into. That's clearly gotten you more and more yeses as you dive

201
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,880
into people's networks, right?

202
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,960
Yeah, no, I totally agree with you. I mean, it's a, it's a huge responsibility. And, and,

203
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,420
and I think that's also where the, the perfectionists, you know, a lot of photographers I find are

204
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,940
perfectionists as well because you know, when then you get this access, you've, you've done

205
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:59,320
all this, this legwork to get to the place where you can photograph somebody and you

206
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:05,780
want to do the best job that you could possibly do every single photograph, every single sitting,

207
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:11,480
every single subject, you want to make sure that you're doing your best on behalf of that

208
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:17,360
person and doing the sitting justice because the photographs are, are hopefully going to

209
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,520
live on. And you know, this is, this is a super important, you know, topic or project

210
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,080
that you're spending time on. You want to make sure it's the best that it could ever

211
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:34,800
be. So you go the extra mile and you knock yourself out every time because that's the,

212
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:41,240
that's the quid pro quo of, of getting access is that you're going to give it 150% every

213
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,240
time.

214
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,520
I'm sitting here nodding profusely at all your words like, yep, that's how you need

215
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:51,400
to do it. And so now that you have, you know, a hundred plus photographs, uh, under your

216
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:57,680
belt for this specific project, um, I guess, what are you, where are you hoping that they

217
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:05,240
live longterm? You know, is there a place you'd like to give the greater public access

218
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,600
to them or some kind of access from the open source community? Like what, what do you see

219
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
as the end goal?

220
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,280
Well, I, you know, I, I think originally when I started the project, I thought, um,

221
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,680
you know, if I can get access to, you know, a representative enough group of the, you

222
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:29,840
know, within the community that it would be, it would be a great book. And so I'm, I've

223
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,200
been trying to get a book, you know, together and design a book and, and get it out, you

224
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,600
know, seriously for the last year. And, you know, it's just been lots of life getting

225
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,600
in the way of that.

226
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,240
Yeah. And a book is no small thing to do. Well, you know,

227
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,080
Exactly, exactly. So ultimately I really do want to do that. I think that, you know, being

228
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,800
able to sit down with a book and look at the photographs, um, you know, in person and in

229
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:06,180
a, in a large size as well is really appealing and impactful. And yeah, I think that that's

230
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,680
going to be the most accessible way for people to physically get kind of get their hands

231
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,960
on the photographs. I, but I think, you know, because it's open source and so much of open

232
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:22,120
sources, I mean, online and it's just, the website is going to be really the focal point

233
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,680
of the project over time. I have done some exhibits like this last year, we exhibited

234
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,000
all the photos at OSCON in the OSCON conference in Portland.

235
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Nice.

236
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,960
Um, you know, these are, you know, sort of, you know, short exhibits in the sense that,

237
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,560
you know, OSCON is really, you know, a little less than a week. So we do these digital exhibits

238
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:49,200
on, you know, these, on, you know, monitors and a portrait orientation and, and it looks

239
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,560
really good and it's really, it's really impactful. And it's an, it's a nice way to do very short

240
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:01,040
term exhibits. Um, I would like to exhibit the prints just because I do all the prints

241
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:07,160
myself and I, I love printing. So, um, you know, be an excuse to, to be able to sort

242
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:13,720
of hunker down and, and, you know, do some, some exhibition quality printing, but that's

243
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,480
a, that's sort of a major undertaking. I have to find the right, it has to be the right

244
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:24,360
venue and it has to be a long enough term exhibit to justify the expense of doing something

245
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,360
like that.

246
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,600
Yeah. Traveling with prints is no small, you know, that's, that's quite a feat.

247
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,560
Yeah, exactly. I mean, you know, typically you have, you're, you're mounting them and,

248
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,440
and then shipping them mounted and, and these are all, you know, fairly high resolution,

249
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:47,200
you know, these are all big, big files. So I, they, they print life size essentially.

250
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,760
And so it's just, it's costly to move stuff around. Um, but I, you know, I hope to do

251
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,260
a real physical exhibit of the prints at some point. Um, maybe in conjunction with launching

252
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,640
the book, we'll see that, that that's probably going to be the right time to do it. But in

253
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,000
the meantime, um, conferences will invite me to come and, you know, exhibit the photos

254
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,440
digitally, you know, on monitors and, and that has been a really nice way to get the

255
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,680
community to see them and interact with them, you know, beyond just them being on the web.

256
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:26,000
There's nothing like seeing a print in person, you know, uh, either through a book or, or

257
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,840
my favorite, which would be as large as possible, right. Um, and in person, especially if the

258
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,160
artist is there, uh, there's just, there's just something about that human connection

259
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:44,120
that you just can't get on the web as wonderful as the web is. Um, so yeah, yeah, no, I agree.

260
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:49,480
The definition of the prints is, and I've, I've printed all of, all of these portraits.

261
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:54,360
You know, I have, you know, I have all the work prints that I do because the printing

262
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:00,360
is actually part of my editing process with, um, especially with black and white. Um, you

263
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,880
know, it's, you can, you can only get the photograph to be, you know, so far on the

264
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,840
computer and then, you know, I have to, you know, I have to print it and sit with it.

265
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,600
And, you know, sometimes I tell people, I say, it may be, it may be a month or two before

266
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,360
you hear back from me on this just cause I'm traveling or something like that. But also

267
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:25,680
it's, it's not a quick, it's not a quick edit. You know, these, the portraits take some time

268
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:30,880
to really sit with and, and you kind of have to marinate in the portrait, if you will,

269
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,760
and put it up on the wall and, you know, make sure you've got the tonality right. And, you

270
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,120
know, come back to it in a day or two and, you know, really just make sure it's, it's

271
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:45,380
dialed in right. And then these faces are so, you know, the faces of the, of the subjects

272
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:52,520
on that project are, are so awesome that it's just, it's so nice to be able to get kind

273
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,560
of right up to it. Whereas with a monitor, you know, you're not, you're not really going

274
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,140
to get right up to it the way you can with a print.

275
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,360
Nor will it necessarily do the photographic work any justice. Right? I mean, monitors

276
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,600
are pretty good, but yeah, it's just, it's not the same. It's not the same. I love hearing

277
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,000
a little bit about your process there. It sounds to me like you're really bringing a

278
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:20,280
lot of your heart and your attention to showing every single person and every single face,

279
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:26,940
I guess, bringing them to their very best for the experience that you had. So, I feel

280
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:33,800
like that's a real, that's a really important thing to do for people. And I love hearing

281
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,560
sort of that, that depth of attention that you're bringing to it. So, thank you for doing

282
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:43,040
that for, for everyone you're photographing, you know, it feels like we've all got stories

283
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:49,400
to tell and, and, and, and capturing people that way is a real gift, really.

284
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:54,560
Yeah. I mean, it just goes back to the 150%, you know, if you're going to get somebody

285
00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:00,200
to show up in front of your camera, you're going to go all the way and beyond just to

286
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,380
make sure that that's the best portrait. You know, and an, and an honest portrait too,

287
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:12,920
you know, you know, of them and, and that's, you know, as a, as a portrait photographer,

288
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:18,800
you know, that's a, that's always a balance you're trying to strike, which is making an

289
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:23,880
authentic, you know, sort of honest portrait of somebody that reveals something, you know,

290
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,360
that you get a little bit of a, of an idea of who the person is or something about their

291
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:38,000
personality through, through the, the portrait as opposed to a highly stylized, you know,

292
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,240
you know, rendition of somebody that may not really be, you know, how you saw the person

293
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,560
in that moment. So that's always a balance you're trying to strike.

294
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:56,740
Ah, the life of photography. Yeah. It's such a great one. Can I ask you how you originally

295
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,280
got into photography? Like what was it about photography itself that kind of grabbed you

296
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,960
and wouldn't let go?

297
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:10,740
So I, you know, first picked up a camera really in high school, started with high school photography

298
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:18,160
and I would say I was pretty much hooked, you know, within the, you know, my, the first

299
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,240
photography class I ever took in high school.

300
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,240
You got the bug, right?

301
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,520
Yeah. And my high school was really good. It had like a really good, uh, it had a lot

302
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:33,520
of photo lab and it had a really good, uh, set of staff and teachers. And it had like

303
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,100
multiple levels, you know, had like the photo one and the photo two and the photo three,

304
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:45,700
you know, courses. So you could really over, you know, the course of high school, you could

305
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:51,640
be doing photography all through high school and continually learning new stuff, you know,

306
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:58,720
the entire time. And, you know, I just, you know, I just got hooked in it and, you know,

307
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,680
I would show up on the weekends to use the lab and the teacher would give me the key

308
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:08,120
and, you know, she, she trusted me to, you know, be in there and yeah, this is all film.

309
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,280
So you were, you know, you were basically developing your own black and white film and

310
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,320
then doing your own printing in the dark room.

311
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,740
And which is such a special experience. If you've, if anyone's ever had that experience,

312
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,920
it's like nothing else.

313
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:26,440
Oh yeah. It's, I mean, I spent so many hours in the dark room, you know, in my teenage

314
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,200
years and in my twenties, um, I don't miss it at all now just cause it's such a, yeah,

315
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,320
we're lucky now. Right. But you know, that's when I sort of first got into it and I had

316
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:40,000
a couple of friends that were really into it as well. So that really helped. And I was

317
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,040
going to go to school after, you know, I was going to go to, um, after I graduated from

318
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:49,960
high school, I, um, became a teaching assistant at the international center of photography

319
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:56,920
in New York and TA'd, you know, a few classes in exchange for getting access to their dark

320
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:03,000
rooms. So I would, I would print there and then I would be a TA for visiting photographers

321
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,160
that would do their classes at ICP. And I just thought, Oh man, this is the greatest

322
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,920
thing in the world. This is what I want to do. And, and when I went off to college, I,

323
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:18,480
I almost went to art school. I kind of thought about it and, and, um, I wound up going to

324
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,640
college and, and, um, at Trinity college in Hartford, Connecticut, and their photo lab

325
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:31,400
was just, it was just abysmal. So I petitioned the student government for a bunch of money

326
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:38,360
and, and actually was able to build a new photo lab for them. Um, when, when I was an

327
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,360
undergrad there.

328
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,360
Good for you.

329
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,080
Yeah. And then, you know, like I just, you know, this is what I was kind of, I was going

330
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:53,160
to do, you know, I was just like total photo nerd, total dark room nerd. And then I started

331
00:29:53,160 --> 00:30:00,360
to get into computers, uh, cause at that point I went, you know, Trinity was one of the first

332
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:08,600
schools in the country that had wired their, um, residential dorms with ethernet. So every

333
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:16,160
student had ethernet jack in their dorm room and the school was hooked up to the internet

334
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,840
via T one, which at the time was pretty good, you know, pretty good bandwidth back. This

335
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,200
is the mid nineties, early and mid nineties. So I had started getting into computers cause

336
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:32,440
my best friend was at Dartmouth and we, Dartmouth, you know, had this very forward thinking email

337
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,760
system. They had developed their own email and the whole campus was electronic and everybody

338
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,400
used email to communicate up there. And we wanted to send email back and forth to each

339
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:48,600
other, you know, from, from Trinity to Dartmouth. So to do that, I had to get an account on,

340
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:55,480
on the Vax, uh, you know, as this, you know, you know, basically mainframe that was in

341
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,280
the computer center. Right. And to do that, I had to learn, you know, Unix commands, you

342
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:07,040
know, cause the Vax ran, I don't remember what variant of Unix, but, um, you know, maybe

343
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,640
a system five or whatever it was. I see. So I can see how this is where it all begins.

344
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,440
You can see this is exactly where it all begins. So, you know, I log in, you know, you know,

345
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:24,240
I've got a Mac and I'm using, you know, uh, telnet or, you know, telnet program to log

346
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:31,260
into this Vax and type in, you know, these commands to change directories and open up,

347
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:36,160
you know, um, the mail program, which at the time was, I think it was pine was what I was

348
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,840
using to start. And I just had to learn these Unix commands and, and I would get stuck and

349
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,040
I would screw something up and I would have to go down to the computer center and I would

350
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:51,280
have to bug the mail administrator to show me how to, you know, flush my mail queue cause

351
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:56,000
I had screwed something up. And, you know, um, so I started to learn all these commands

352
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,640
and, and these funny programs and he would give me these one liners, you know, these

353
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:07,420
one line shell commands, you know, with pipes and stuff that would, you know, grip my mail

354
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:12,960
spool and output it to a text file so I could read it cause I had screwed something up and

355
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,060
pine wasn't recognizing it or I don't remember what it was at this point, but I had to learn

356
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:21,400
all these programs. And I remember at that point thinking like, who the hell comes up

357
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:27,440
with the names, all these things. I mean, all said, of course, pine, what the hell,

358
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,680
like what does this all stand for? You know, like what is, what is all this? And it, I

359
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,760
didn't, I kind of, you know, I, I mentally, I look at that now as like, yeah, I remember

360
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,640
having that thought and then I kind of put it out of my mind and you know, then, you

361
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,200
know, 20 years later and I come back to this project, the faces of open source, I'm photographing

362
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:54,480
you know, Al Aho of awk and Peter Weinberger, you know, like the people that created awk,

363
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,280
the people that wrote said the people that, you know, Ken Thompson, you know, you know,

364
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:05,200
you know, the, the people that came up with the algorithms behind grip and you know, send

365
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,800
mail and all these Unix programs that, you know, I first interacted with, you know, just

366
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,400
when I, you know, kind of got into the internet.

367
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:18,640
What's most interesting to me about that as a tiniest side is that like most computer

368
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:26,840
users these days never, ever interact with any of those, right? Although they were just

369
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:33,360
so important for the timeline of computers and timeline of, you know, Unix and the open

370
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,760
source and all of that. So, so it's great for you to have a little bit of that personal

371
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,600
history and now, you know, a few years later, you're getting to meet some of these people

372
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,040
that that must feel really cool. It was, it was cool. And in fact, with this project,

373
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:53,720
that's kind of where I started. I started with the, the Unix, um, the folks at bell

374
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:01,880
labs, um, that wrote Unix and I started with that community. And then I started photographing

375
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,440
from there. I started photographing the BSD community and then the Linux community. And

376
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,960
I kind of went through operating systems and then I, you're like tracing history almost,

377
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,640
right? Exactly. Exactly. I figured I'll start at the, I'll start at the beginning and then

378
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:22,440
kind of work my way down the family tree, um, and then out to these other communities.

379
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,660
And it's been, it's been, it's been really, really cool to sort of retrace some of my

380
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:31,840
own personal computing history through this project and then meet, meet some of the people,

381
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,720
you know, who, who are behind all this, this tech that we, you know, I mean, as you say,

382
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:43,140
most people don't even interact with it anymore, but what's amazing and what's totally astonishing

383
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:49,420
to me and, and it's so wonderful is that all of this tech is still living in their computers

384
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:55,720
right under the glossy gooey, you know, if you're on a Mac, you know, it's, you know,

385
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:03,560
you've got BSD in there and, um, people are, or, or iOS or Android, you have Linux and,

386
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:09,540
you know, all of this open source, all this tech and all of that fundamental Unix goodness,

387
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,960
the design and the, the core programs that have since been rewritten with the GNU project

388
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,400
and all this stuff, they're all living on everybody's computer. They may not be interacting

389
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,840
with it directly, but they're all still there. And that's, that's such a cool, that's such

390
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:30,160
a cool thing. I find it really cool and fascinating, but at the same time, there's a hint of like,

391
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,040
it's a bit tragic in some ways because it, it doesn't often get celebrated in the ways

392
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,560
that perhaps it, it should, you know, uh, maybe it's unfair to expect every single computer

393
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,800
user to want to celebrate, you know, the, the simplest of tools, uh, that make everything

394
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:51,120
run. But, uh, wouldn't it be great if we could just all say, thanks. I totally agree with

395
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:55,440
you. I mean, and I think, you know, when I, when I started doing this project, you know,

396
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,680
I think that was really one of the driving forces for me behind the project more, you

397
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:05,280
know, in addition to the personal interest of just meeting a lot of these pioneers that

398
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,360
have developed this was, you know, how do I get, how do we get this story out there?

399
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:18,200
Right. Because without all of this technology and without all, all of the software specifically,

400
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:22,920
you know, most of which is open source at this point, we wouldn't have any of this stuff

401
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:29,460
that we're, we're relying on now. And, and you're absolutely right that most people don't

402
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:36,040
know it's there. They don't know that they're every time they log into a website, they're

403
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:41,540
relying not just on the open source nature of the web, the protocols that run the web,

404
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:47,640
but they're using hundreds of open source programs. Every time the page is rendered,

405
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:52,120
you know, there's hundreds of open source programs, you know, you know, tens of thousands

406
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:57,600
of lines of code, you know, at work, open source code at work, bringing that webpage

407
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:05,080
to them, pulling down that next email you know transferring that file, you know, up,

408
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:10,760
you know, to, to, to the cloud. All of that is open source. And without that, you know,

409
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:16,680
this would be a, we'd be in a very different world, right? Oh yeah. I really felt like

410
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:22,860
it was important to get that story out there. And, and my thinking is, you know, as a photographer,

411
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:29,440
what can I do? I can try to bring that story to life through photography and, and specifically

412
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,000
through the people, you know, and the human, the humans behind all this amazing code and,

413
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,120
and put that on display so that people realize, Hey, all this, I am relying on this. This

414
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:46,800
is an amazing phenomenon that has, that, that is responsible for getting us to where we're

415
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,840
at today. And it should be celebrated. It should be acknowledged and celebrated. And,

416
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:55,160
and hopefully the photography, you know, helps do that. That's, that's, that's the goal of

417
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:00,880
the project at this point. Yeah. It's your way of giving back with the gifts that you

418
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,720
have to open source, which is a really beautiful thing. Yeah, totally. And so I wanted to jump

419
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,960
back to your history a little bit. You were, you were driving us through, you know, a little

420
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:17,800
bit of your history early with some of the Unix stuff. And I know that a lot of that

421
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:24,120
leads into your discovering open source. So I wanted to kind of, if you can walk us through

422
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,240
that a little bit more. So you were just telling us, you know, that you were discovering Unix

423
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:36,840
and playing with email, you know, the deep depths of email. I was on the VAX sending

424
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:45,880
email to Dartmouth. You know, I got very interested in the internet, just being able to transfer

425
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:52,040
information and being able to disseminate information. And, you know, I started to discover

426
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:57,160
this thing called Usenet, which is, you know, again, most people today, you know, wouldn't

427
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,920
know what that was if they're just kind of getting familiar with the internet. But, you

428
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:08,920
know, essentially the, you know, worldwide discussion, you know, news system, you know,

429
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,880
with topics on everything in the world, sort of the precursor to the web, if you will.

430
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:25,800
And I started discovering that. And then this thing called NCSA Mosaic showed up. And I

431
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:32,840
immediately saw, wow, this is really interesting. And the first time I saw it, and the first time

432
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:39,160
I saw a webpage, I thought, oh, this is going to be a great way to show my photography.

433
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:48,280
So I was like, oh, this is great. I can't wait to put my photography up on a webpage because

434
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,320
up until that point, you know, I mean, and you know this, you know, if you wanted to share your

435
00:39:53,320 --> 00:40:01,160
photography with somebody, you're in the darkroom making prints for people. And the way that I

436
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:06,840
print, you know, and used to print and print today, even still, is it's very elaborate.

437
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:12,120
But back then in the darkroom, it's not about just putting the paper underneath and exposing,

438
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,520
you know, exposing the paper and, you know, out comes the print like you're at a drugstore

439
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:22,600
getting a print done. You know, it's an involved process of dodging and burning and manipulating

440
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:27,400
the light as it comes out of the enlarger and doing contrast masks and, you know, all the stuff

441
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,440
today that you do in Photoshop, doing that on an analog way, waving your hand in front of the light.

442
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And you could never, I could never really truly get prints, you know, two prints to be identical.

443
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,800
I mean, you would try, you would write down your instructions, but it would take a phenomenally

444
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,120
long time. And every print was kind of a one of a kind piece of art. So if you wanted to

445
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:55,240
give a print to somebody, that was a big deal. If you wanted to share your photography and show it

446
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:00,040
to somebody, you had to print it out. And wow, that could be an elaborate, really time consuming

447
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:06,440
process. So here comes the web and I'm thinking, great, I'll just scan in the print and I'll make

448
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:12,280
a webpage and I can just send the webpage to people and they can look at my photography that

449
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,320
way. And I was like, this is going to be the greatest thing in the world.

450
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:22,040
You were right. So I started talking to some friends about it and they're like,

451
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:27,880
wow, we could do a lot of cool stuff with this. We could like, you know, provide information,

452
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:35,560
you know, poetry and writing. And we kind of got the idea to do a little magazine,

453
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:42,120
sort of like a student magazine. I was at that point doing photography for the newspaper

454
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:49,160
periodically as well, being photo geek. But, you know, we thought, well, we could get the,

455
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:54,600
we could get a whole magazine up on the web and we could get submissions from all of our friends

456
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,960
at other colleges via email, because now that we know how to use that, they could just send

457
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,080
in writing periodically and we could then publish this thing on the web. And, you know, I look back

458
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,920
on that now and I'm like, wow, that was like, you know, maybe one of the best ideas I ever had at

459
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,760
that point in time. It sounds kind of bold too at the time, right? Yeah. At that point in time.

460
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,800
And we developed this, this little magazine that went up on the, that was the first

461
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:25,960
magazine on the web. That's awesome. And we would get contributions from all over the internet and

462
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:30,760
we would publish this on, sometimes we put our photography up and sometimes it would be, you

463
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:37,160
know, reported stories from journalists, students, and, you know, it would just be a mix of different

464
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,440
things and we're having a good time with it. And, you know, all this while I'm figuring, well, I'm

465
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:49,080
going to, I'm going to graduate from college and go back to New York and maybe I can get a job

466
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,720
assisting somebody and, you know, start my photography career. So like the traditional

467
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:59,640
photography path, I suppose, right? Yeah. I mean, I think that was, that was always in the back of

468
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:04,520
my mind was, you know, I want to have my own studio. I want to live in a loft and be a photographer

469
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:11,800
and, you know, you know, go down that, that New York city photographer path. But I, one day I got

470
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:20,680
an email from out of the blue from this guy who was the head of an ad agency in Silicon Valley,

471
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,840
a guy by the name of Dave Karlik, who's a dear friend now. And it's been a mentor to me since,

472
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:35,080
since that first email. And he wrote me saying, Hey, I saw, you know, some of my guys sent around

473
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:41,000
this magazine that you're doing. We're an internet, we're an ad agency that does all

474
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,280
the internet work for the white house and Netscape and, you know, Chrysler. And, you know, this is in

475
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:54,840
sort of the mid nineties when nobody had a website, everybody was trying to get on board. And he was

476
00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:01,800
in Silicon Valley and it was a small agency. It was a small sort of cutting edge boutique agency

477
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:09,720
that was doing all of this really early web work. It's an agency called Poppy Tyson. And he said,

478
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,400
you know, we have, you know, this group in Silicon Valley doing this, but you know,

479
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:18,920
you're in New York and I want to set up a whole New York operation. You know, can you come in and,

480
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:26,680
you know, can we talk? Wow. And so I go to go in New York, I go in for this interview and

481
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:33,000
we're talking and he's like, okay, show me your, you know, show me your, show me your website.

482
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,920
And of course, you know, I couldn't, you know, of course, you know, anytime you're doing a live demo,

483
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:41,240
you can't get anything to work. So of course, yeah, I couldn't, I couldn't pull up the website.

484
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:46,040
So I'm just, oh no. Right. So I'm just like describing it to him and I'm like, this is what

485
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,280
it is. And this is how it is. And, you know, we'll look at it later, but, you know, for some reason

486
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:55,400
we can't get it on the computer anyway. So he's like, well, this is really great. He's like,

487
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,960
you know, I want to hire you to come in and do all this interactive stuff. And, you know,

488
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,040
you're an ad agency and it's this creative environment and, you know, I think you really

489
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:10,840
love it. And I was like, oh my God, wow. Somebody wants to pay me to do creative work on this new

490
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:15,080
platform called the internet, which is like going to be, you know, at that point I was just like,

491
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,720
this is going to be the biggest thing in the world. And I was like, absolutely, this sounds,

492
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:26,600
this sounds great. And so I, you know, I went for an interview there when, you know, I thought,

493
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:32,440
well, maybe I should interview somewhere else. And I had gotten another email from the guys at

494
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:38,600
time at a time ink, cause they were an early, they had an early internet presence. And I,

495
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:43,240
I went into interview there and I didn't really like, you know, I didn't really like the,

496
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:49,320
the folks over there as much as, as Poppy Tyson and, and I'm working for Dave. And so I

497
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:55,000
took this job working for, for Poppy Tyson, doing this early internet work in the early

498
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:04,840
nineties. And that just took me on this, this whole different trajectory. And I spent 20 years doing

499
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:11,960
internet tech ventures and photography was kind of on, on the side where I could fit it in.

500
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:17,240
And so I, I described to my, you know, and that was up until, you know, a little over 10 years ago,

501
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:22,200
I decided it was time to get back to photography. So I always joke to people that photography is my

502
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:30,600
first love and, and second career having spent, you know, 20 years doing start internet and

503
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:37,560
technology startups in, in New York and Silicon Valley. And that's really where I got really

504
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:43,320
inundated with open source. That's really, you know, kind of the first, the, my first exposure

505
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:51,000
to open source was, was after I left Poppy Tyson, I, I, in the, the heyday of the.com bubble,

506
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:59,560
I had started a company, you know, that did, you know, analytics, web analytics, very similar to a

507
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:04,840
cert, you know, sort of a, an online SAS service, very similar to what Google, Google has now with

508
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:09,960
Google analytics. It sounds like you were a bit earlier than they were. Yeah. Way, way earlier

509
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:15,400
than Google. No, there was no Google at that point. And it was in the sort of heyday of the bubble.

510
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,760
And we raised a bunch of money and, you know, this was going to be, you know, this big,

511
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,280
this big thing. And I was really into, you know, the data and how people were using these websites.

512
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,360
And that was really fascinating to me. So we started this company and we're trying to get

513
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:35,560
this thing off the ground. And yeah, this was in 99, you know, literally like, couldn't have been

514
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,880
like, it was the best timing to raise a bunch of money, but then it was the worst timing in the

515
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,880
world to operate a company. And, you know, there was no cloud, there was no nothing. I mean, to

516
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:52,280
get these businesses off the ground back then, you literally needed tens of millions of dollars in,

517
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:57,960
in capital to purchase hardware, stick it in a data center. I mean, luckily at that point,

518
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:03,080
the co-location model of co-locating, instead of building out your own data center,

519
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:08,200
you could just rent some space and co-locate your equipment in someone else's data center.

520
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,840
So luckily, like we didn't need, you know, a hundred million dollars to build a data center

521
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:18,840
network. We could just co-locate, but you still needed tens of millions of dollars to purchase

522
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:27,400
storage from EMC and servers from Sun and database licenses from Oracle and, you know, all of this,

523
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:33,320
this huge iron to, to crunch these numbers and to do data processing at that point.

524
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:38,120
So we raised this money and we purchased all this equipment. And then when the

525
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,920
dot com bubble burst and we needed to raise more money, you know, we couldn't and, you know,

526
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:49,320
we kind of wound up having to sell, sell the business which we, we, we wound up doing that

527
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:55,800
and sold it to a company called a search engine, ironically enough called LookSmart out in San

528
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:01,320
Francisco. But you know, the, the, the funny story I always tell about my first exposure to open

529
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:08,040
source was while we're building this web analytics company, we, we purchased all this big iron from

530
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:13,400
Sun. We purchased literally like this thing that looks like, you know, I mean, I'm sure you've

531
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,440
seen Star Wars or, you know, those movies or any of the Star Wars movies, they all have the same

532
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:24,760
thing where, where Obi-Wan Kenobi goes and like has to shut off the, the, you know, force field

533
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,320
of the Death Star so that Luke Skywalker and the crew can come in and blow it up.

534
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:35,640
And he goes out on like, you know, this parapet and there's this big like monolith thing and he's

535
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:42,040
got to pull these latches, you know, on like four sides and it's this hulking like tower.

536
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:47,560
Yeah. We had, we, we had to buy one of those, you know, I always joke like that's what we had to

537
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:52,280
buy to run that business. Did you have a Death Star to put it into as well? It was literally,

538
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,520
it looked like a Death Star. It looked like the control panel of the Death Star. It was this

539
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:04,600
Sun's biggest computer, their E-10K, its infamous computer. It was so big. It required a forklift to

540
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:09,640
get it into the, you know, the, the data center. And, you know, it was just massive and we bought

541
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:15,480
it because, you know, it was like at that point, you know, running lots of small computers and,

542
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:23,720
and clustering them, you know, wasn't as, you know, that wasn't an obvious, easy pattern to

543
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:29,080
use at that point. It was much easier for us to just have one big computer with lots of CPUs.

544
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:35,160
So we decided we would buy this big computer, lots of CPUs and we'd run Oracle on it. And

545
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:42,120
Oracle had promised through their software, they had that their database, you could do,

546
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:48,520
you could run a query across multiple CPUs, this product they had called Oracle parallel query,

547
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,200
which probably cost us 50 grand just to purchase the license for that thing.

548
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:52,840
Oh man.

549
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,720
In hindsight, it's all so funny. I'm just shaking my head as I tell this story.

550
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:02,680
You know, we're thinking, oh, great. That's, that's how we're going to get the throughput

551
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:08,840
we need for these data warehousing queries is we'll run this Oracle, you know, software across

552
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:13,240
all this multiple CPUs and this big sun box. And we'll have enough power to do all the data

553
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:15,160
warehousing queries we need to do to run the business.

554
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:20,040
That must've seemed pretty exciting at the time. Cause it sounds like you're combining some pretty

555
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:23,400
high tech of the time, right? Is that the feeling you got?

556
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,520
It was, it was, it was super exciting. I mean, you know, to be able to put all this tech to work and,

557
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:33,720
you know, in service of, of running a, what was, you know, would later be called

558
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:40,040
SaaS, a SaaS product, you know, instead of like shipping people CDs and having them install it,

559
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:43,880
we would run all the hardware and they would just ship us. The data would come to us and we would

560
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,200
do all the processing on our end. So it was like a, it was a lot of new stuff. It was like a whole

561
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,840
new world of the internet. It was a whole new world of, of analyzing websites, all sorts of

562
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:58,520
new technology. And we were so excited and we had all this money from venture capitalists and all

563
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:04,120
this stuff. And we get all this stuff in the data center and we install the software and

564
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,920
we start running it through its paces and we just can't get it to work.

565
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:16,680
It's just the Oracle software, just, it won't use more than one CPU per query.

566
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,560
So the promise they've made isn't coming true.

567
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:24,680
The promise they made is not coming true. And of course, you know, we've paid more money than

568
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:30,440
God for a support contract. So, you know, our, my CTO is on the phone and we're trying to work with

569
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:36,920
them and we escalated and escalated and escalated through their system. And, and ultimately it just

570
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,640
comes back to like, yeah, that's a bug. That's a bug. We're, we're going to have to get a fix for

571
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:46,920
that, you know, out to you. And we're like, okay, great. When, when can we expect, you know, how many

572
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:52,520
days will that take? And they're like, Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. We're not talking that's the wrong

573
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:58,200
days is not the right metric, you know, the right, the right way to measure this, you know,

574
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:03,640
like, Oh no, this will come out in the next release cycle. And, you know, that could be,

575
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:08,200
you know, weeks, it could be, it could be months. And we're like, what, you know, like,

576
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:13,480
are you kidding me? Like we've got our whole stack is you guys promised us this would work.

577
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:17,560
And we bought all this stuff. And, you know, of course we're just like this naive, you know,

578
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,840
group of 20 somethings trying to make this all make all this work.

579
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:24,680
But it sounds like your business was sort of relying on that function.

580
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,320
We're like, Jesus, what are we going to do? Like we're, we're kind of screwed on this now.

581
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:34,920
So my CTO is like, okay, look, this isn't going to work. We're not going to be able,

582
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:38,440
we're going to have to use the Oracle database differently. We're going to have to do the data

583
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:44,200
processing off of this thing. You know, I've started experimenting with this thing called Linux.

584
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,840
And I think we could just get some, you know, at this point we'd spend all our money on the C 10 K.

585
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,160
Right.

586
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:53,480
So we're like, okay, well we could just get some really inexpensive computers

587
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:59,240
and try to use Linux in a cluster to do the data processing.

588
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:04,440
When he first suggested it to that seem like kind of depressing because you've, you know,

589
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,520
focused all your attention on this dream product and here you are maybe putting together a few,

590
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,680
like it's, it sounds like clearly lesser computers.

591
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:16,280
Well, if you know, it was more like, Oh my God, I hope that works.

592
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,800
Right. It was more like, Oh, I, my fingers are crossed. Like, you know, this is,

593
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,440
this is of course also like, I'm like, well, how much is Linux going to cost us? You know, and

594
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,280
you know, all this and he's like, no, no, no. Linux is Linux is free. It's, it's open source.

595
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:34,120
And you know, we don't have to pay for that. And I'm like, Oh, okay. I'm like, but is it going to

596
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:40,280
work? You know, it's a, it's a valid question. Right. And his answer to me and, you know,

597
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:45,720
I'll never forget it was, you know, if it doesn't, we can fix it. And I was like, Oh, right. I'm like,

598
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:52,040
right, right. Cause we're screwed waiting for Oracle here. And so that's what we did. We,

599
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:58,680
we bought a bunch of, you know, commodity, you know, com you know, commodity computers

600
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:06,360
and Intel computers and we ran Linux on it, you know, and, and we did our data processing that

601
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:14,600
way. And we, we used one CPU at a time in this big hulking desk star of a, of a sun computer for,

602
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:20,920
for running the, for, for the database. And, you know, the, the ironic thing about that entire

603
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:27,000
experience as, as kind of crazy and depressing as it was, as we're, you know, as the bubble is

604
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,880
bursting all around us and we're realizing, God, you know, we've like, you know, we, we can't raise

605
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:36,760
more money for the business and, you know, it's costing hundreds of thousands of dollars a month

606
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:40,920
to run, you know, we're going to have to, we're going to have to sell the, sell the company and,

607
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,960
you know, you know, you know, because of the.com had had burst at the, the bubble had burst at

608
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:52,600
that point. And I remember we're, we're, it was the last couple of days of closing down our office,

609
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:58,520
which was down on wall street. And we're just, you know, kind of tidying everything up and,

610
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:01,720
you know, getting the space right, you know, getting all of our stuff out of the space.

611
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:09,720
And this FedEx guy comes and, and starts knocking on the door. And I'm like, Oh, I wonder what this

612
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:13,560
is, you know, like, I wonder who's, you know, we haven't ordered anything, you know, we're like

613
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:18,280
days away from just turning out the lights on this office. Cause we had sold the company to,

614
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:23,080
to look smart in San Francisco and all the operations were moving out to San Francisco.

615
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:28,840
And I'm like, Oh, what's this? I wonder what this FedEx is. And I go and I sign for the FedEx and,

616
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:39,640
and I open it and it's literally a 25 CD-ROM patch kit from Oracle with the, with the fix

617
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:45,640
for the parallel server bug that we had filed eight months before.

618
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,400
Well, it did come as they promised.

619
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:56,440
It finally came, you know, it was like, it was like so little, so late, so irrelevant,

620
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:03,240
like we had moved on so far beyond that, but it was just so ironic that here we are, like,

621
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:08,520
we couldn't get the tech to work. We're waiting and waiting. We have to give up on it. We go to

622
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:14,040
open source. And like one of the last days of the history of the company, eight months too late,

623
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:19,800
the bug fix comes from the commercial software provider. And I just remember thinking I'm

624
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:24,200
holding this stuff in my hand right before I threw it in the garbage. And I'm saying to myself,

625
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:31,960
I will never, ever one make, you know, buy Oracle software again, but two, I just won't ever make

626
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:37,720
that mistake to be beholden to a commercial software vendor for running, for running anything

627
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:44,360
on my business because you literally, you can, you could go bankrupt. Like it could bankrupt you. It

628
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:50,760
could be like the fatal flaw in your technology stack. And you could then be, you know, completely

629
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:56,040
handcuffed on dealing with it. And that was a hard lesson to learn. You know, it all worked

630
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:01,960
out in the end. We sold the company and it was all fine, but wow, what a lesson. And that was

631
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:07,800
the beginning of, you know, another 15 years of running everything on open source, every venture

632
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:14,280
I ever did, every company I ever worked for after that, it was all open source and, you know, me

633
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:19,000
convincing people, no, we're not going to renew that Oracle license. No, we're not going to buy

634
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:25,320
more sun equipment, you know, and it was like, I was like Dr. No for 10 years in these companies,

635
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:31,400
getting people weaned off of this commercial proprietary software, you know, and into,

636
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:35,560
into using open source. So that was, that was how I got into it. That was my, that was my,

637
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,320
that was my indoctrination by fire, if you will.

638
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:47,400
What a powerful moment and turning point for you. Right. And I could see why it's such a deep part

639
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:56,040
of you now in trying to both celebrate it and, and, and sharing it with others. That's an amazing

640
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:02,040
story. Well, listeners, we're going to take a tiny break here for now. Stay tuned for part two

641
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:06,920
coming later this week, where Peter and I explore more topics like open source photography workflows,

642
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:21,480
artificial intelligence, and the future of photography.
