WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
respectful of the University of British Columbia andloop

00:33.120 --> 00:47.200
Welcome to a very special extra, man do you remember when we used to play this song for

00:47.200 --> 00:48.200
way too long?

00:48.200 --> 00:49.200
It's so long!

00:49.200 --> 00:53.880
It is really long, and then the other egregious thing we'd do is we'd play the music for like

00:53.880 --> 00:57.960
a full minute and a half under us while we did the show.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.840
It's the slow fade out.

00:59.840 --> 01:05.640
Well, we actually just were sitting down to put together another fantastic episode of

01:05.640 --> 01:06.640
the Unplugged program.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.200
You know, it comes out every week.

01:08.200 --> 01:14.040
I did a little behind the scenes on the Chris Lass cast recently, and then I think it got

01:14.040 --> 01:18.160
in the back of my head that maybe we should do a full blown legit extra on this.

01:18.160 --> 01:22.380
And so while we were show prepping, we thought, well, let's talk about what goes into a show.

01:22.380 --> 01:23.380
We're here doing it right now.

01:23.380 --> 01:24.920
Let's sit down and record this.

01:24.920 --> 01:29.040
And we thought, wouldn't it be fun to kind of look back because Linux Unplugged was launched

01:29.040 --> 01:31.000
on August 12th, 2013.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.640
That's like seven years ago.

01:33.640 --> 01:35.000
Seven years.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.760
And a lot has changed in actually what the show looks like and sounds like.

01:38.760 --> 01:41.240
Seven years on the internet might as well be 30.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.720
It was a different internet back in 2013.

01:43.720 --> 01:44.720
It was.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.840
It was a very different Linux Unplugged.

01:46.840 --> 01:51.920
See Linux Unplugged started as a concept to relieve a problem I had in Linux Action Show,

01:51.920 --> 01:55.720
and that was too much damn email, and I felt really guilty that I wasn't getting to all

01:55.720 --> 01:58.240
of the emails coming into the big show.

01:58.240 --> 01:59.800
And so I thought, I know what I'll do.

01:59.800 --> 02:03.520
I'll create a podcast where I read emails.

02:03.520 --> 02:08.800
It was it was a rough concept, but you know, Matt Hartley was down to clown on this idea.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.440
And so we jumped on mic.

02:10.440 --> 02:14.280
We launched with our virtual log on Hangouts.

02:14.280 --> 02:15.280
The audio quality was atrocious.

02:15.280 --> 02:16.280
Wow.

02:16.280 --> 02:17.280
I'm glad I missed this episode.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.280
All right.

02:18.280 --> 02:19.280
This is embarrassing.

02:19.280 --> 02:20.280
But I'm gonna play this for you.

02:20.280 --> 02:21.280
OK.

02:21.280 --> 02:25.920
This is gonna this is gonna be this is gonna hurt me because I sound like I'm on helium

02:25.920 --> 02:28.280
and I'm going a million miles per hour.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.560
So it's it's really tough.

02:29.560 --> 02:32.700
You are just young and excited about Linux Hangout.

02:32.700 --> 02:34.680
So far, we're a little hit and miss.

02:34.680 --> 02:38.140
But we'll bring that we'll bring in the panel that we have assembled later in the show as

02:38.140 --> 02:39.140
we get going.

02:39.140 --> 02:42.280
But first, I want to just take a minute and talk about the new show.

02:42.280 --> 02:45.840
We don't plan to do this too often, but it's kind of an opportunity to talk about ourselves

02:45.840 --> 02:46.840
a little bit.

02:46.840 --> 02:51.600
Matt and I were kind of brainstorming on a couple of problems that the Linux Action Show

02:51.600 --> 02:52.600
has faced.

02:52.600 --> 02:56.760
And one has been that we just have this torrential amount of feedback that we generate every

02:56.760 --> 03:00.240
single week from every single show and ideas sometimes on how to do something differently

03:00.240 --> 03:02.040
than how we talked about in the show.

03:02.040 --> 03:05.040
Whoa, bro, slow down.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.140
I don't even know.

03:06.140 --> 03:07.640
And I can't even do it now.

03:07.640 --> 03:11.280
And ideas we had talked about to do it in another show, like it's like I can't even.

03:11.280 --> 03:13.680
I mean, you were streaming it live after all.

03:13.680 --> 03:14.680
Yeah.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.720
You got to be got to be on your game when you're live.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.280
Or maybe you were nervous.

03:18.280 --> 03:19.280
We were on it.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.280
Google Plus Hangouts.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.280
Big audience.

03:21.280 --> 03:25.120
It's it's hey, did you actually know that maybe that's not the best way to do it or

03:25.120 --> 03:26.120
anything like that?

03:26.120 --> 03:27.120
Right.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.120
Exactly.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.400
And trying to find a way to present that in a way that wasn't going to just actually become

03:30.400 --> 03:31.400
a time suck.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.400
Right.

03:32.400 --> 03:33.400
Yeah.

03:33.400 --> 03:34.400
Because it would drag down the whole show.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.400
Exactly.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.400
And I had I had threatened for like a long time.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.880
I was like, one of these days, Matt, I'm going to make a feedback show and also kind of talk

03:38.880 --> 03:40.120
about his feedback.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.120
Even my old man.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.120
Yeah.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.120
That's gotten a lot better.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.520
That sounds like my old man's way better now.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.520
Much older.

03:46.520 --> 03:52.240
What's so sad about it is we don't even have to do like some sort of musical transition

03:52.240 --> 03:58.040
between old clips and new clips because it's so patently obvious which one is young Chris

03:58.040 --> 03:59.040
and which one's old Chris.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.040
Oh, yeah.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.000
And this is 100 episodes before you join the show.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.140
So it was Matt and I just riffing.

04:04.140 --> 04:07.700
That's kind of what we're doing, although that's not the show in its entirety.

04:07.700 --> 04:10.240
That's only going to be a component of this show.

04:10.240 --> 04:13.060
You know, I mean, the feedback, I think, is going to generate a lot of good discussion

04:13.060 --> 04:14.480
and a lot of ideas.

04:14.480 --> 04:20.620
But I'm hoping that this show is even more of an opportunity to kind of get down into

04:20.620 --> 04:21.620
some episodes.

04:21.620 --> 04:24.760
I want to just like totally just dig into a topic and we're just going to only talk

04:24.760 --> 04:26.160
about really just that.

04:26.160 --> 04:30.800
And maybe we'll just spend an hour discussing something, just really go deep.

04:30.800 --> 04:34.180
Sometimes I want to just be all over the board and just talk about topics that have come

04:34.180 --> 04:37.520
up throughout the week, things that people want to bring up, you know, do panel discussions

04:37.520 --> 04:39.720
kind of like we're going to try in this episode.

04:39.720 --> 04:42.400
That kind of has bared out to a degree or other.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.960
In some ways, that's the core of the show.

04:44.960 --> 04:48.120
It's funny because the arc of the show, which we'll talk about in a moment, didn't actually

04:48.120 --> 04:49.120
go that way.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.120
It's funny to me.

04:50.120 --> 04:53.580
Have me say that episode one, the show ends up not going in that direction.

04:53.580 --> 05:00.120
But now here we are, I think we just were recording 341 or 342, 343.

05:00.120 --> 05:04.560
And we're now more closer to what I'm talking about here than we were 100, 200 episodes

05:04.560 --> 05:05.560
ago.

05:05.560 --> 05:06.560
That's weird.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.200
Some ideas take a long time.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.200
I'm real slow, Wes.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.360
I'm a I'm a slow approach, you know, you know, I don't win the race.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.280
But I get there eventually.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.360
I don't know.

05:16.360 --> 05:18.960
There's no excuse for it other than I think we'll actually talk about it.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.720
We'll talk about there's a couple of things that came up that sort of affected the show's

05:21.720 --> 05:22.720
evolution.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.200
But let's go back to that first episode.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.720
I'm pretty excited about the prospect of it.

05:25.720 --> 05:29.080
I think it's going to be interesting to see how this comes to fruition, which direction

05:29.080 --> 05:32.240
we end up taking it and really where the chat room guides us to.

05:32.240 --> 05:33.240
Yeah.

05:33.240 --> 05:37.000
And what from this will kind of surface up into the big show and make that an even better

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
show.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.440
And I'm looking forward to it.

05:39.440 --> 05:44.760
But I wanted to start, I thought, with the most classiest way.

05:44.760 --> 05:45.760
And that would be me complaining.

05:45.760 --> 05:49.560
Always, always a classy, a classy approach.

05:49.560 --> 05:50.560
Right.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.400
Like whenever you want to impress people, the new show, the first thing you want to

05:52.400 --> 05:56.240
do is try to offend a good subset of your potential listeners.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.000
That's Podcaster 101.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Everybody knows that.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.360
I don't know why more shows don't do this.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.360
It's glad.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.720
I'm glad I nailed the essentials.

06:02.720 --> 06:03.720
Even back then.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.520
Yeah, that's a policy we follow today.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.720
Do you know what I was upset about?

06:07.720 --> 06:09.480
Do you have a guess?

06:09.480 --> 06:11.920
It's a classic love topic.

06:11.920 --> 06:12.920
System D?

06:12.920 --> 06:13.920
No, because there was no System D then.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.560
But this is pre, oh, it's 2013, right?

06:16.560 --> 06:17.560
Yeah.

06:17.560 --> 06:18.560
I'll give you a hint.

06:18.560 --> 06:23.120
It has to do with a reoccurring problem back then in a desktop environment.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.120
Wi-Fi?

06:24.120 --> 06:28.640
It wasn't quite, Wi-Fi wasn't quite so bad in 2013.

06:28.640 --> 06:34.480
But audio, particularly under plasma, was a real problem back then.

06:34.480 --> 06:39.000
And so I was about to get in a good old too much choices causing this.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.160
You would never complain about desktop Linux.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.160
No, no.

06:42.160 --> 06:46.720
It was one of those, this problem ultimately comes down to too much choice and we rely

06:46.720 --> 06:47.720
on that.

06:47.720 --> 06:50.040
I mean, it was a decent early rough rant.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.440
You were still kind of honing the soapbox.

06:52.440 --> 06:56.200
Oh man, the Hangout Audio 2 was so bad.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.600
I'm so much happier with Mumble.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.640
And we had, in the pre-show, we had Rando stop by.

07:02.640 --> 07:06.700
They were just like browsing Google Plus, Windows users who were like, what, you bunch

07:06.700 --> 07:08.240
of Linux geeks.

07:08.240 --> 07:09.240
We had weird drive-bys.

07:09.240 --> 07:12.120
Are you saying maybe we should start streaming on Hangouts again?

07:12.120 --> 07:13.120
Well, yeah.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.120
I mean, definitely.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.120
It seems obvious.

07:15.120 --> 07:17.100
Let's get Google Plus back up.

07:17.100 --> 07:22.560
There was also, I'm surprised, we had ads in the very first episode, which from like

07:22.560 --> 07:24.680
a getting my business together standpoint.

07:24.680 --> 07:25.680
Impressive.

07:25.680 --> 07:26.680
Yeah.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.680
In 2013, the business was enough together that I launched a show with ads.

07:29.680 --> 07:33.640
But the ad itself, you're not going to believe it.

07:33.640 --> 07:34.640
Oh, I'm excited.

07:34.640 --> 07:38.100
But look, here's something else that I worry about, and our next sponsor is going to help

07:38.100 --> 07:41.920
you solve a problem that is becoming more and more of a concern for a lot of us with

07:41.920 --> 07:49.000
a lot of the recent NSA revelations going on, ProXPN, a VPN provider in 2013, way ahead

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
of the trade.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
Way ahead.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
But listen to this read.

07:52.000 --> 07:57.360
They are what I think is becoming one of the up-and-coming premier VPN solution providers.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.280
They got all types of VPNs, great VPNs.

07:59.280 --> 08:02.040
The best VPNs, great VPNs.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.040
This is way ahead of the curve.

08:03.040 --> 08:07.740
I was shilling VPNs Trump style before it was cool.

08:07.740 --> 08:11.160
It's got all the VPNs, the greatest VPNs, the best encryption.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.880
Do you still have your ProXPN account?

08:12.880 --> 08:14.520
I don't think so.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.740
OpenVPN, which obviously I'm a huge fan of.

08:16.740 --> 08:17.740
Huge fan of OpenVPN.

08:17.740 --> 08:18.740
Huge fan.

08:18.740 --> 08:19.740
Of course.

08:19.740 --> 08:22.800
So if you haven't thought about why you might want a VPN, obviously the first is to kind

08:22.800 --> 08:27.000
of protect your identity online, and the other would be to keep what you're doing private.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
It's funny because I just recently, in one of our team meetings, was like, when we were

08:31.000 --> 08:35.400
considering doing a piece on VPNs, and I was like, I want us to discuss the fact that fear

08:35.400 --> 08:40.520
mongering is being used to sell these VPNs, and the VPNs add consolidation of traffic,

08:40.520 --> 08:43.960
which we should definitely look at as another potential security vulnerability.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.120
And then here I am, in episode one, doing that.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.120
I remember how this came about.

08:47.120 --> 08:50.360
It was a new partner we were trying that got an ad slot for me.

08:50.360 --> 08:54.140
It was like a one or two time deal, and we were just testing it.

08:54.140 --> 08:57.040
And now listening back to it, I'm like, oh man, I'm so glad we didn't stick with this.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.680
Because you don't remember me doing this, right?

08:58.680 --> 09:01.240
This is what I tried and stopped doing it.

09:01.240 --> 09:04.600
Even though you might be VPNing to somewhere else, it might eventually get monitored.

09:04.600 --> 09:06.560
It's at least one step removed.

09:06.560 --> 09:10.120
Oh, I guess I was at least, old Chris also worried about it.

09:10.120 --> 09:14.240
Listen, this might not be that effective, but if you think you want a VPN, buy this

09:14.240 --> 09:15.240
one.

09:15.240 --> 09:20.280
I got to give myself credit for at least addressing the traffic, since I just raised that.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.280
I forgot.

09:21.280 --> 09:22.280
Wow.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.280
I'm proud of myself right there.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.920
I at least said, hey, you are centralizing your traffic.

09:26.920 --> 09:29.140
To put yourself physically in another location.

09:29.140 --> 09:33.840
So maybe if you need to be over across the pond, either side of that pond, ProXpn can

09:33.840 --> 09:35.160
help you do that.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.220
And we've got a great deal for ProXpn.

09:37.220 --> 09:42.960
When you go to ProXpn.com and you decide to buy, you can take 20% off the lifetime of

09:42.960 --> 09:43.960
your purchase.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.320
And I think their base rate's only like seven bucks a month.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.320
It's super cheap.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.320
It's crazy cheap.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.320
Yeah.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.320
Yeah.

09:50.320 --> 09:51.320
Solid contribution there by Matt Hartley.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.960
Thanks, Matt.

09:52.960 --> 09:58.480
I like, I just, I think it's so funny that there's so many VPN ads and they're basically

09:58.480 --> 10:04.000
using those same, be more secure online, watch content that's not in your region.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.080
It's great.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.320
So there I was.

10:07.320 --> 10:13.040
But I obviously had a lot to learn and took a lot of experimental trajectories.

10:13.040 --> 10:16.760
One of them was bringing in a live chat, which you would think would be ridiculous.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.280
Live audio open to the internet.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.840
Honestly, I'd shoot that idea down today.

10:20.840 --> 10:26.100
And so there was a lot of experimentation in format, including trying to create and

10:26.100 --> 10:29.920
cultivate a show that felt really low key.

10:29.920 --> 10:35.240
And this is, these are people that love Linux and we're just hanging out.

10:35.240 --> 10:38.400
And part of that was the realization that we should probably have a little bit of a

10:38.400 --> 10:42.880
pre-show, a warmup, get a conversation going with folks.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.360
And we were digging through the archive and we found one more clip that I think is the

10:46.360 --> 10:50.320
most embarrassing clip of them all, worse than the ad.

10:50.320 --> 10:57.480
In episode 67, I don't know what was wrong with us, but we had a five plus minute pre-show

10:57.480 --> 11:00.920
where we were rambling on about something that I actually couldn't tell you what we

11:00.920 --> 11:02.040
were talking about.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.160
Obviously highly relevant to Linux Unplugged.

11:04.160 --> 11:07.440
Started with zero context and listening back, I'm like, I have no idea what we're talking

11:07.440 --> 11:08.440
about.

11:08.440 --> 11:09.440
I don't want to listen to this.

11:09.440 --> 11:11.160
And then it goes on for five minutes.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.320
I still don't grok the context.

11:13.320 --> 11:21.240
And then, then the real tragedy happens, my worst introduction in Linux Unplugged history.

11:21.240 --> 11:31.980
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's celebrating its cheat day.

11:31.980 --> 11:33.560
My name is Chris.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.560
And my name is Matt.

11:34.560 --> 11:35.560
Hey Matt.

11:35.560 --> 11:39.680
So it's been a few weeks, almost a month, that I just have been kind of going like really

11:39.680 --> 11:45.200
light on the breads and stuff, not like 100% cut it out, but what am I doing?

11:45.200 --> 11:49.160
You know, you never give us diet updates at the start of the show anymore.

11:49.160 --> 11:54.800
What could have, five minutes of incomprehensible talk followed by an introduction where I talk

11:54.800 --> 11:57.560
about cutting bread out of my diet?

11:57.560 --> 11:58.560
What am I doing?

11:58.560 --> 12:04.760
This is, 2020 Chris looks back at that and I would never start a Linux podcast this way.

12:04.760 --> 12:10.080
And I must have been trying to just like keep it super cash, but I obviously went way too

12:10.080 --> 12:11.940
far on the old cash lever.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.760
Really light, you know, just really going back to that, getting back to that.

12:14.760 --> 12:17.280
And it's, oh, it's been great, Matt, it's been great.

12:17.280 --> 12:21.040
But today before the show, we're working on something huge for tomorrow.

12:21.040 --> 12:25.360
And I don't, you know, it's like in this last stage where it's the most work and you don't

12:25.360 --> 12:28.520
know if you're going to make it in time, but we have something really big for the Jupiter

12:28.520 --> 12:31.520
Broadcasting Network tomorrow that we're working on today.

12:31.520 --> 12:33.820
The compression is horrible.

12:33.820 --> 12:36.080
The audio quality is subpar.

12:36.080 --> 12:41.120
It's funny, you know, I recognize it because I listened during this stage of Linux Unbugged.

12:41.120 --> 12:44.080
It doesn't sound like you, but it still sounds eerily familiar.

12:44.080 --> 12:49.640
The music is still playing and by this, this is like six and a half minutes into the show,

12:49.640 --> 12:52.600
actually longer because the intro music went on forever.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.600
And we still are not talking about Linux.

12:54.600 --> 12:59.120
Like this would be considered like an egregious error in 2020.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.880
But I'm like starving and I'm like, okay, I got to order a Jimmy John sandwich.

13:02.880 --> 13:03.880
What am I doing?

13:03.880 --> 13:04.880
I can't leave.

13:04.880 --> 13:05.880
You've been listening to the radio.

13:05.880 --> 13:11.080
No, it's just like, I know I got to get this work done and then I got to go do the Unplugged

13:11.080 --> 13:12.080
show.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.080
I got to go do the Unplugged show.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.760
So I figure I'll order Jimmy John's, but I'm going to be a good boy.

13:15.760 --> 13:16.760
Lettuce wrap that sandwich.

13:16.760 --> 13:17.760
I'm going to get a lettuce wrap.

13:17.760 --> 13:20.800
I am still talking about the bread stuff.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.960
We got to be eight minutes into the show, real showtime here.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.440
How do I sell ads for this?

13:25.440 --> 13:27.560
Yeah, a little roughage, sure.

13:27.560 --> 13:30.720
So I order Rekai's sandwich because you know, he's working on this project with me and I

13:30.720 --> 13:32.840
order myself a nice big lettuce wrap.

13:32.840 --> 13:33.840
Double up on that meat, Matt.

13:33.840 --> 13:34.840
I get double up on that meat.

13:34.840 --> 13:35.840
What's happening?

13:35.840 --> 13:36.840
What is happening?

13:36.840 --> 13:37.840
Giving like a Jimmy John's ad.

13:37.840 --> 13:38.840
I know.

13:38.840 --> 13:39.840
I'm like talking about meat.

13:39.840 --> 13:44.480
What is happening?

13:44.480 --> 13:45.640
And it shows up at the front door.

13:45.640 --> 13:46.640
I grab the bag.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.640
I go upstairs.

13:47.640 --> 13:48.640
We get all situated in our offices.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.480
We sit down and we start working again.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.480
And you know what?

13:51.480 --> 13:52.480
What, Chris?

13:52.480 --> 13:55.680
Please, please let it be about Linux.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.200
Please be about Linux.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.200
They put it on bread.

13:59.200 --> 14:07.200
And at that point, Matt, I was so hungry and I've been wanting a sandwich so bad, Matt.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.200
I've been wanting a sandwich so bad.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.920
I ate the whole sandwich, Matt.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.760
And I got a little bit, I think if I went to the doctor right now, they would say, Chris,

14:14.760 --> 14:17.480
you are clinically diagnosed with food coma.

14:17.480 --> 14:22.720
Am I trying to be a stand up right now?

14:22.720 --> 14:24.940
With like a 10 minute lead up to a job?

14:24.940 --> 14:28.860
Clearly this like whole sandwich debacle was a major part of your day and all you could

14:28.860 --> 14:29.860
think about.

14:29.860 --> 14:31.240
I'm like, I'm just free flowing.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.440
I'm going with my id.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.120
You are currently in a state of food coma.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.580
So we're going to get through today's episode.

14:36.580 --> 14:38.520
It's going to be kind of a thick episode.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.840
There's a lot of things going on with the Debian project.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.160
Oh, there it is.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.160
Finally.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.720
How long do you think that was into the show?

14:45.720 --> 14:47.160
Got to be dang near nine minutes.

14:47.160 --> 14:48.160
Probably.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.160
It doesn't even sound like you want it.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.200
We're going to get through this episode.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.960
Doesn't sound like you want to do the episode.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.360
That is so embarrassing.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.360
That is.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.360
I'm like in tears.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.360
That's so embarrassing.

14:57.360 --> 14:58.360
Wow.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.360
There's nobody that would say that.

14:59.360 --> 15:00.360
Say, what are you doing?

15:00.360 --> 15:02.360
What are you doing, man?

15:02.360 --> 15:03.360
Stop it.

15:03.360 --> 15:04.360
Well, lesson learned.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.800
I guess we did learn over time.

15:05.800 --> 15:06.880
We've tightened up a bit.

15:06.880 --> 15:07.880
We have.

15:07.880 --> 15:11.240
There was really sort of the middle years that came after that where the show got really

15:11.240 --> 15:12.240
news heavy.

15:12.240 --> 15:17.140
It was almost all news from top to bottom with a little bit of feedback.

15:17.140 --> 15:21.840
There's a real transition point in there where the feedback and the follow up, which we started

15:21.840 --> 15:25.480
every Unplugged with, moved to the end of the show.

15:25.480 --> 15:29.680
And then as a little time went on, it just kind of became less and less.

15:29.680 --> 15:31.280
We're making more effort to bring it back.

15:31.280 --> 15:32.720
Yeah, there's sort of a feedback comeback.

15:32.720 --> 15:36.880
Yeah, there is a feedback comeback now, but there was a transition where we just went

15:36.880 --> 15:42.440
to sort of a topical discussion show because it was easy for the virtual lug to have opinions

15:42.440 --> 15:43.440
about.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.440
Right.

15:44.440 --> 15:45.440
This is stuff they could all reference.

15:45.440 --> 15:46.440
There's articles written up about it.

15:46.440 --> 15:49.900
And I mean, you know, this was still during the Linux action show era for a lot of this.

15:49.900 --> 15:53.200
And so, you know, you guys were doing big projects and had interviews there.

15:53.200 --> 15:55.040
There was no Linux action news yet.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.080
So there was a little more room on the network, too.

15:57.080 --> 16:00.120
Well, not only that, but there wasn't nearly as many Linux podcasts.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.680
So there's less people doing the news.

16:01.680 --> 16:06.440
But also, there's a reality to it is I didn't have a team back then.

16:06.440 --> 16:09.280
It was people with their volunteer time.

16:09.280 --> 16:15.580
So a news show where you just have a group of people talk about the news is easy compared

16:15.580 --> 16:21.040
to anything where you're building something or you're installing something or you're testing

16:21.040 --> 16:23.500
something or you're benchmarking something.

16:23.500 --> 16:28.760
It all takes exponentially more time than keeping track of the news, formulating an

16:28.760 --> 16:32.520
opinion and then jotting down some notes and then repeating those opinions into a mic.

16:32.520 --> 16:33.520
Right.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.520
And everyone can sort of collaborate.

16:34.520 --> 16:35.520
Right.

16:35.520 --> 16:37.600
Everyone sort of pitches news stories and you just got to pick through them.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.720
And opinions are easy to come by.

16:39.720 --> 16:40.760
Oh, yeah.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.960
So then it really becomes, well, is there something about your opinion?

16:43.960 --> 16:45.840
Is it informed by a certain angle?

16:45.840 --> 16:49.480
Is there something about your opinion that is special?

16:49.480 --> 16:54.240
And the reality is, when you just have a large group of topics and a large group of people,

16:54.240 --> 16:58.100
you kind of just kind of end up with the same standard conversations.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.480
That was sort of the middle age of the show.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.280
And I think it worked for a period.

17:01.280 --> 17:05.280
And also, I think, marked some of the transition to Linux Unplugged also being something of

17:05.280 --> 17:07.680
an online Linux users group.

17:07.680 --> 17:10.920
You know, we started thinking of the show that more as we bonded, got some regulars

17:10.920 --> 17:11.920
in there.

17:11.920 --> 17:15.440
That was a big part of it is having some regulars that pop in from time to time.

17:15.440 --> 17:20.940
And then a big moment for us that shifted us into a more news-focused era, like that

17:20.940 --> 17:25.200
middle layer of LUP as it sits right now, was SystemD.

17:25.200 --> 17:30.680
SystemD sort of tracks all the way back to early LUP, like the 20s, but it really built

17:30.680 --> 17:34.000
over time and it became a story that we kind of kept checking in.

17:34.000 --> 17:39.440
And it's still sort of true today, really, that I looked at the Linux action show as

17:39.440 --> 17:45.280
Star Trek The Next Generation, and I looked at Linux Unplugged as Deep Space Nine, where

17:45.280 --> 17:48.600
Deep Space Nine had ongoing narratives through multiple episodes.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.680
We're checking back in on things, following up.

17:50.680 --> 17:55.440
Yeah, we could have a topic take two or three episodes sometimes, whereas last was showcase,

17:55.440 --> 17:56.440
you're done.

17:56.440 --> 18:00.160
That episode is self-contained, much like Star Trek The Next Generation was.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.880
Different products of different eras.

18:01.880 --> 18:07.040
And the SystemD conversation, I think, really cemented that format and sent us down the

18:07.040 --> 18:08.040
news path for a while.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.760
Well, and it was, you know, at that time, there was a lot of shake-ups.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.160
The news had big news in it.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.880
And I think it was useful, frankly, we kind of needed to talk about it, right?

18:16.880 --> 18:19.800
We were going to be talking about it anyway, it was this big change that was happening

18:19.800 --> 18:21.080
from the outside.

18:21.080 --> 18:23.860
So I think it was useful for the show to have an outlet like that.

18:23.860 --> 18:28.720
And it was a moment for us to realize, hey, if we take the extra time to really read both

18:28.720 --> 18:33.600
sides of this, try to understand how it works from a technology perspective, try to figure

18:33.600 --> 18:35.940
out, okay, what's the motivation for this massive change?

18:35.940 --> 18:37.400
What problem is it solving?

18:37.400 --> 18:41.600
Now can we communicate that to the audience in a way that is relatable and understandable?

18:41.600 --> 18:45.120
And SystemD taught us, I think, in a big way how to do that over its run.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.120
Right.

18:46.120 --> 18:50.680
While we may even like or want to use SystemD, you also have to acknowledge the design flaws

18:50.680 --> 18:54.040
or things that just aren't done in the way that you would like them to be done.

18:54.040 --> 18:57.580
Now I think as time has gone on, we have the news component, but it could be sometimes

18:57.580 --> 18:59.960
no more than one or two stories.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.760
And then there's a mix of conversation pieces in there.

19:02.760 --> 19:07.880
But this has now transitioned as we've become full-time at doing this, we've tried to level

19:07.880 --> 19:11.680
up the amount of time we spend prepping an episode of Linux Unplugged, and it's put some

19:11.680 --> 19:13.280
pressure on us.

19:13.280 --> 19:17.080
But it's pressure I think we're happy to carry because we're trying to, in every episode,

19:17.080 --> 19:19.000
create some original coverage.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Yes.

19:20.000 --> 19:23.400
Well, there's things that we need to talk about as a community that aren't always timely

19:23.400 --> 19:24.400
with the news, right?

19:24.400 --> 19:28.840
That just change on different scales or are too complicated to be really written up in

19:28.840 --> 19:30.520
the sort of shallow textile.

19:30.520 --> 19:31.520
Yeah.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.580
And we have a pretty good list of contacts now.

19:33.580 --> 19:37.740
So when there's something going on with WireGuard, we've been able to email the WireGuard author

19:37.740 --> 19:42.560
or when Nebula from Slack was launched as their peer-to-peer VPN solution, although

19:42.560 --> 19:46.120
I don't think they like to call it that, we're able to get that developer on the line.

19:46.120 --> 19:51.480
And in fact, something we did with that episode that I really liked is we had the Tink developer.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.080
Gus Koos?

19:53.080 --> 19:54.080
Yes.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.080
Yes.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.080
Good memory, Wes.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.280
And that was such a neat episode because it's like, here's two products that are in the

19:58.280 --> 20:00.040
open source ecosystem.

20:00.040 --> 20:03.440
One is brand new to the scene and one's been here for a decade.

20:03.440 --> 20:06.800
How do they solve this problem differently coming at it from these two different eras?

20:06.800 --> 20:08.700
And I really enjoyed that kind of stuff.

20:08.700 --> 20:13.200
That's the kind of stuff we try to do now more of that we couldn't really afford to

20:13.200 --> 20:17.760
do in all of the senses of the word when people were volunteering their time.

20:17.760 --> 20:22.400
And then you came around in episode 100 when we had that barbecue and just hit the ground

20:22.400 --> 20:23.400
running.

20:23.400 --> 20:27.920
You know, it's been too long since we've fired up that old barbecue.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.660
That is for serious, Wes.

20:29.660 --> 20:33.240
That is for real serious, especially when we've had a couple of surprise nice days.

20:33.240 --> 20:34.720
It's ridiculous.

20:34.720 --> 20:35.720
So here's what we do.

20:35.720 --> 20:38.160
We get a couple of wireless mics that we can, you know, attach to our shirts.

20:38.160 --> 20:39.680
We get a little outdoor grill cam.

20:39.680 --> 20:40.680
Sure.

20:40.680 --> 20:41.680
And that's the pre-show.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.080
I mean, I think we tried that once before.

20:43.080 --> 20:46.840
I mean, the barbecue is steeped in tradition on the show.

20:46.840 --> 20:51.040
It's a touchstone element that we need to get back to as part of this self-reflection

20:51.040 --> 20:54.640
process we were doing now and we have been doing recently with this show.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.320
We need to get that barbecue element in there.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.760
I think it's pretty important.

20:58.760 --> 21:03.200
A lot of the work, all of the work, all of the work proportionally for Linux Unplugged

21:03.200 --> 21:05.560
is before we ever sit down on the microphones.

21:05.560 --> 21:08.040
And it really, I mean, it almost never stops in a sense.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.720
Once one episode is recorded, there's another one.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.520
You got to kick off planning for the next.

21:12.520 --> 21:17.520
And the more intricate and more, you know, if you want a guest or if you want to set

21:17.520 --> 21:19.120
stand some stack of software.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.120
Right.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.800
Are you going to try something that you really need to experiment so you can comment on meaningfully?

21:22.800 --> 21:24.440
Are you going to run a desktop for a week?

21:24.440 --> 21:28.880
Like you got to start basically as soon as we get all of the description done for the

21:28.880 --> 21:32.200
one we just recorded, we start working on the next one.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.260
And that can ramp up depending on the ambition of the show.

21:35.260 --> 21:38.540
Sometimes it means we both go off to our own camps and work.

21:38.540 --> 21:41.920
Sometimes it means we collaborate at the studio like we're doing today.

21:41.920 --> 21:46.000
We both sit down here in the studio and work on something and we try to get as much done

21:46.000 --> 21:51.800
as possible because at noon Pacific, the show starts and it's all live to tape.

21:51.800 --> 21:55.200
Every clip that we play, every sound bite, it's all live.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.600
Every interview, it's all live, done to tape.

21:57.600 --> 21:58.960
And then we're done.

21:58.960 --> 22:04.160
The actual production of the show in a big sense is the least amount of work for us because

22:04.160 --> 22:05.440
we just sit down and talk.

22:05.440 --> 22:06.440
We've already prepared.

22:06.440 --> 22:07.440
We know what we're going to say.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.540
We've done it for so long that it's not like we have butterflies.

22:09.540 --> 22:11.760
It's not hard for us to sit down and start talking.

22:11.760 --> 22:12.820
So we got all that.

22:12.820 --> 22:16.960
It's everything we do before then and then it's everything that happens after the show

22:16.960 --> 22:19.880
when we flack out each individual track.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.520
Everybody's recorded on their own individual tracks.

22:22.520 --> 22:23.840
We flack all that up.

22:23.840 --> 22:27.080
We use Nextcloud to send it off to Joe for editing.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.180
That's really worth talking about almost as its own part of the era.

22:30.180 --> 22:34.960
When Joe started helping out, started editing Unplugged, I think that was one of our triggers

22:34.960 --> 22:39.400
to realize that we could take things to the next level because we had someone who could

22:39.400 --> 22:41.720
just really improve the quality of the show.

22:41.720 --> 22:42.720
Yeah, you're right.

22:42.720 --> 22:48.160
Going multi-track and having Joe come on board to help with not just the editing but also

22:48.160 --> 22:52.960
help direct some of the content has been really beneficial because it's brought a critical

22:52.960 --> 22:56.800
air to the show so that way I don't do dumb things like do a five-minute intro talking

22:56.800 --> 22:58.200
about bread.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.200
Could you imagine?

22:59.200 --> 23:02.040
That's kind of never going to happen now.

23:02.040 --> 23:06.900
With the multi-track audio, we can do noise removal for each individual voice.

23:06.900 --> 23:08.720
We can EQ each individual voice.

23:08.720 --> 23:15.880
We can really go to the next level of quality that we'd never even gotten near before.

23:15.880 --> 23:20.220
Joe's so dedicated to it that he stays up till way late on his time.

23:20.220 --> 23:25.720
He's probably up till 3 a.m., 4 a.m. working on every Linux Unplugged because we don't

23:25.720 --> 23:28.060
start till noon here our time.

23:28.060 --> 23:29.060
That's new.

23:29.060 --> 23:33.640
Yeah, we've tried to move it a little bit to accommodate, but he stays up until the

23:33.640 --> 23:34.640
show's out.

23:34.640 --> 23:37.800
If it's a big show with lots of tracks and extra guests and editing that needs to be

23:37.800 --> 23:43.200
done because we did something extra, he's staying up until 5 a.m. to get the show out.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.680
Well, he's also able to get clips ready for us.

23:45.680 --> 23:49.680
If we do have a guest on, he can make sure that's pre-edited and ready for us to just

23:49.680 --> 23:52.080
play live on air, which is very helpful.

23:52.080 --> 23:57.720
Yeah, and he'll match the EQ of the interview so it sounds natural.

23:57.720 --> 24:01.360
It's a nice secret sauce and being dedicated so much to stay up late like that to get it

24:01.360 --> 24:05.040
out so that way it's available the next morning so it's as relevant as possible, it's ready

24:05.040 --> 24:07.040
for the morning commute.

24:07.040 --> 24:11.120
I think it's a big part of why people tune it up because it's right there.

24:11.120 --> 24:12.120
You know that episode.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.600
If you're listening to it, it's as relevant as physically possible for a show of that

24:15.600 --> 24:16.600
production quality.

24:16.600 --> 24:21.880
So it really has been refining our hosting approach, refining how we interact with the

24:21.880 --> 24:26.320
community, refining our audio production, and then refining what we cover in the show

24:26.320 --> 24:29.440
to try to do more original stuff, more guest interviews.

24:29.440 --> 24:30.440
We've really gotten pickier.

24:30.440 --> 24:33.960
I mean, I think we have a lot of the same ideas we've always had, but fewer of them

24:33.960 --> 24:36.200
make it because we just have higher standards.

24:36.200 --> 24:40.200
For better or for worse, sometimes it makes us feel like we're a little stuck, but other

24:40.200 --> 24:44.360
times we feel like we've really nailed it and it's like this great, like, oh man, we

24:44.360 --> 24:45.360
really pulled something off there.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.360
That feels great.

24:46.360 --> 24:50.200
So I think it's very common for this kind of work actually.

24:50.200 --> 24:51.520
I think that's a very common thing.

24:51.520 --> 24:52.520
You can't stay still, right?

24:52.520 --> 24:57.000
I mean, no one else in this space stays still, and if we kept doing the same thing, we'd

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
all get bored.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.280
I think we probably can't say enough, though, how important our virtual log has been.

25:02.280 --> 25:06.760
It's been such a huge component, and they've stuck with us throughout this whole show.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.560
We'd love to have you join us live.

25:08.560 --> 25:11.600
We do Linux Unplugged live on Tuesdays at noon Pacific.

25:11.600 --> 25:15.000
You can get it in your local time at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.760
You know, if you can't make it to the mumble room, we've also got an IRC channel.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.240
We love our chat room.

25:19.240 --> 25:25.640
IRC.geekshed.net, pound, Jupiter Broadcasting, Octothorp, Octothorp, yeah, yeah, it's good.

25:25.640 --> 25:26.640
Hey, guess what?

25:26.640 --> 25:53.760
We'll see you next Tuesday!
