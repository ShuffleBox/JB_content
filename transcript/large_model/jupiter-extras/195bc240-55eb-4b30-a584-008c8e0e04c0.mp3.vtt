00:00.000 --> 00:11.280
Hi, everyone, it's Joe here. And today I'm going to talk to you about what I've learned

00:11.280 --> 00:17.120
over the last seven years of being a podcaster. And the last kind of 18 months of being professional

00:17.120 --> 00:23.160
full time with it. Let me get this caveat out of the way. First of all, these are just

00:23.160 --> 00:29.660
my opinions. And you may have differing opinions. If you do, I'd love to hear from you. I'm

00:29.660 --> 00:34.040
always interested in a conversation about these things. There's as much art as there

00:34.040 --> 00:37.640
is science in this. And everyone has their own way of doing things. This is just what

00:37.640 --> 00:43.000
I think. So if you want to get in touch with me, then at Joe Rissington on Twitter, or

00:43.000 --> 00:48.120
extras dot show slash contact. So with that out of the way, the first part of this is

00:48.120 --> 00:54.320
the recording space, where you're going to actually be when you record. Now, most people

00:54.320 --> 01:00.120
will be looking to do this in their home office, let's say. Now, the ideal office has got no

01:00.120 --> 01:07.680
clutter in it, a lovely hardwood floor, minimalist decor, lots of hard surfaces everywhere. Well,

01:07.680 --> 01:12.640
unsurprisingly, that is a terrible studio. It's a terrible studio, because all those

01:12.640 --> 01:18.280
hard surfaces create echo. And that is what you don't want on your recordings. What you

01:18.280 --> 01:24.840
ideally want is to have as dead a sound as possible. And by that, I mean, no echo, no

01:24.840 --> 01:30.680
reverb, no anything else apart from your voice. And so there are a few ways of getting rid

01:30.680 --> 01:37.760
of that echo. The first one is just with basic physics. If you surround yourself with soft,

01:37.760 --> 01:46.600
fluffy things, then they will absorb the reverberations, the echo, and make it sound better. So just

01:46.600 --> 01:52.880
generally lots of stuff and clutter is a good start. So not being tidy, not having perfect

01:52.880 --> 01:59.800
hard surfaces everywhere, that can help. Having a carpet or a rug rather than a wooden floor,

01:59.800 --> 02:05.240
that's a great start. Even getting things like cushions and pillows or duvets, comforters,

02:05.240 --> 02:09.360
blankets, whatever, and just trying to cover up the surfaces and just trying to get as

02:09.360 --> 02:16.080
much of that bulk into the room with you and towels and bedsheets, just anything soft.

02:16.080 --> 02:19.840
Now if you want to spend some money on this, the first thing that you can do is get some

02:19.840 --> 02:25.360
acoustic foam panels. They're usually around about a foot by a foot or 30 centimeters by

02:25.360 --> 02:31.160
30 centimeters. And they come in various colors. Black is the most common. But you can either

02:31.160 --> 02:36.160
get kind of a bobbly pattern on them or sometimes they have like a row of teeth like in a triangle

02:36.160 --> 02:40.660
pattern. It doesn't really matter what you go for. It's just that same basic physics

02:40.660 --> 02:48.560
principle that they are soft and foamy and will absorb sound and reverberations. So you

02:48.560 --> 02:52.960
can stick them all over your walls. Obviously that doesn't look great. You can do it quite

02:52.960 --> 02:58.280
artistically if you're not like me and then it can look okay but it's generally not going

02:58.280 --> 03:03.880
to get spousal approval. What you can do if you're a little bit handy and practical is

03:03.880 --> 03:08.440
build yourself some sort of room divider. That's something that Drew did and there's

03:08.440 --> 03:14.960
a blog post that we can link to telling you how he did it. And that is basically the same

03:14.960 --> 03:19.560
principle as sticking these foam panels on your wall but it's just on something that

03:19.560 --> 03:24.400
can be folded away and looks a bit neater when you're not recording. Of course if you

03:24.400 --> 03:31.560
want to get really serious then setting yourself up in a dedicated space for recording is the

03:31.560 --> 03:36.900
best. Now if you're in America you might have a big enough closet to do that and thankfully

03:36.900 --> 03:43.720
closets tend to be full of clothes which are soft and absorb sound and so that is a great

03:43.720 --> 03:47.960
place to start. Now I hope Elle doesn't mind me saying this but that's where she records

03:47.960 --> 03:54.580
in her closet and I think it sounds great on her recordings. Or you could build yourself

03:54.580 --> 04:02.760
a little room like I have. My room isn't ideal because it's quite small and I've got bedsheets

04:02.760 --> 04:07.840
hanging on the walls of it. I'm not very happy with it to be honest. I have ordered some

04:07.840 --> 04:12.040
acoustic panels. I've got some up. They helped a little bit but I need to put some more up

04:12.040 --> 04:16.040
so I need to get some more of them and I'm hoping that I'll be happier with the sound

04:16.040 --> 04:21.480
after that. But it's kind of good enough for me and most importantly being in London it's

04:21.480 --> 04:26.880
very loud around here. There's a lot of planes and just general noise and being in a dedicated

04:26.880 --> 04:34.600
room kind of helps with that. Now the second topic is types of microphone. There are essentially

04:34.600 --> 04:39.960
two main types of microphone that you can buy. One of them is a condenser and the other

04:39.960 --> 04:45.400
is a dynamic. The main difference between a condenser microphone and a dynamic microphone

04:45.400 --> 04:51.680
is that the condenser requires power and is more sensitive and in ideal situations and

04:51.680 --> 04:59.080
a stress ideal it sounds better or can sound better than a dynamic mic. A dynamic mic doesn't

04:59.080 --> 05:07.840
require power and it is less sensitive and in an ideal studio setting might not necessarily

05:07.840 --> 05:15.480
sound as good as a good condenser. Some typical examples are the Blue Yeti and the Blue Snowball.

05:15.480 --> 05:21.920
They are condenser mics and they are incredibly popular and they are a terrible microphone

05:21.920 --> 05:26.880
for most people getting into podcasting. I have got the Rode NT1 which I'm talking to

05:26.880 --> 05:33.280
you on now. Again I'm not massively happy with it but it's doing the job and I'm happy

05:33.280 --> 05:40.420
enough. The most common dynamic mic is a Shure SM58. That is what you'll see stand-up comedians

05:40.420 --> 05:46.680
and singers generally in a live situation using. They are great microphones and you

05:46.680 --> 05:51.540
could do worse than that. I know some guys who do professional podcasting with them.

05:51.540 --> 05:57.120
It's not necessarily my first choice but they are okay. The Rode Podcaster which is used

05:57.120 --> 06:05.360
on BSD now, Benedict and Alan have both got one, that's an okay mic. That's USB and dynamic.

06:05.360 --> 06:12.080
Most of the Jupiter broadcasting crew have got an Electro Voice RE320. That is basically

06:12.080 --> 06:17.400
everyone apart from Chris. He has an RE20 which is basically a better version of that

06:17.400 --> 06:22.280
because he's the boss. He has to have the best obviously. Some of the pros and cons

06:22.280 --> 06:27.840
of these microphones. The condenser, the pros are that it sounds better in a perfect setup

06:27.840 --> 06:33.380
in my opinion. Some people may disagree with that but I think it does. It's also more forgiving

06:33.380 --> 06:39.360
of poor mic technique. By poor mic technique, if you drift away a little bit like this or

06:39.360 --> 06:46.440
you're talking around the side of it, it doesn't sound great but it's not as bad as it can

06:46.440 --> 06:51.720
be with a dynamic mic where you have to have really good mic technique because if you drift

06:51.720 --> 06:57.440
away from it, even a little bit like this, I'm a few inches away, the drop-off in volume

06:57.440 --> 07:03.360
is a lot more than with a condenser so it's more forgiving if you don't have a good technique.

07:03.360 --> 07:09.320
The cons of a condenser mic are that it picks up everything in the room and beyond the room

07:09.320 --> 07:15.000
and I mean everything. If I shuffle my feet around, that's just rubbing on the carpet,

07:15.000 --> 07:20.680
you can hear that quite clearly. With a dynamic mic, you'll hear a lot less of that. Also

07:20.680 --> 07:25.200
the echo factor, if you haven't got a perfect room then it's going to pick up a lot more

07:25.200 --> 07:31.240
of that echo versus your voice which you want it to pick up. I tend to fiddle with things

07:31.240 --> 07:35.400
while I'm recording as well. I've kind of got a bit better at that but if there's anything

07:35.400 --> 07:42.920
like sweet wrappers, it picks up that really loudly or clicking pens or anything and anything

07:42.920 --> 07:47.560
outside as well. I live fairly near Heathrow and so sometimes there's planes going over

07:47.560 --> 07:52.280
that are really loud and my condenser mic picks that up quite loudly and I have to kind

07:52.280 --> 07:58.760
of pause and edit it out which is very annoying and noisy neighbours and sirens and dogs and

07:58.760 --> 08:04.600
just anything you can imagine that's outside, it will pick that up potentially. Whereas

08:04.600 --> 08:09.840
with a dynamic mic, it picks up more of your voice compared with that other noise that

08:09.840 --> 08:17.080
you don't want including echo from your room. One of the main disadvantages is that it requires

08:17.080 --> 08:22.200
good mic technique. You have to stay in the sweet spot so I haven't got a dynamic mic

08:22.200 --> 08:26.760
here to demonstrate that but if you drift away from it then it can give quite a different

08:26.760 --> 08:31.520
sound and it just sounds a bit weird so you need to kind of be much better at working

08:31.520 --> 08:37.080
the mic. Now whether you go for a condenser mic or a dynamic, you have two choices at

08:37.080 --> 08:43.880
that point. Either you go for a USB microphone or you go for a microphone with an XLR connection

08:43.880 --> 08:48.200
which you then need to plug into an interface which then plugs into the computer. Whereas

08:48.200 --> 08:55.180
with a USB mic, it's much simpler. Just a mic, a USB cable and a computer. However,

08:55.180 --> 09:01.720
if you buy a USB only microphone like the standard Yeti, you are limited in that it

09:01.720 --> 09:06.760
has to be USB connection. You can't use it in any other situation. You can't upgrade

09:06.760 --> 09:13.640
the mic and keep your interface. It's cheaper to buy a USB mic than a mic and an interface

09:13.640 --> 09:19.820
but I think it's kind of like buy cheap, buy twice situation. If you buy an interface that's

09:19.820 --> 09:26.760
good enough and even a fairly cheap one, less than $100, I think the one that a lot of the

09:26.760 --> 09:33.400
crew uses is the Zoom U22. I think you can pick that up for 50 pounds sometimes on Amazon.

09:33.400 --> 09:39.040
That will allow you to try out different microphones and upgrade microphones over time whereas

09:39.040 --> 09:45.380
with a USB mic, you're just stuck with it. Another big disadvantage of using a USB mic

09:45.380 --> 09:50.440
is that they tend to be quite noisy because if you're going to cram all of the electronics

09:50.440 --> 09:57.240
that make it an audio interface into a microphone, then the electronics are kind of too close

09:57.240 --> 10:05.000
to the capsule, the thing that picks up the sound. So often with Yetis, I get recordings

10:05.000 --> 10:11.320
from people who have used Yeti and it's full of kind of ground noise, just buzz and hiss

10:11.320 --> 10:17.120
and it's just not ideal really whereas you are less likely to suffer from that kind of

10:17.120 --> 10:22.160
thing with a proper USB interface and XLR microphone.

10:22.160 --> 10:25.720
One thing that's quite important regardless of what kind of microphone you use is a pop

10:25.720 --> 10:30.180
shield or pop filter as they're sometimes called. That is to remove what we call plosives

10:30.180 --> 10:35.680
or the puh-puh sound. Now if I come around and get out of the way of my pop shield and

10:35.680 --> 10:40.640
I say Peter Piper, you'll hear how terrible that sounds whereas if in front of my pop

10:40.640 --> 10:46.240
shield I say Peter Piper, you can hardly hear that plosive sound.

10:46.240 --> 10:51.400
The two main types of those are the foam type which is kind of a round foam thing that you

10:51.400 --> 10:57.360
push over the microphone and they are somewhat effective. They're definitely better than

10:57.360 --> 11:01.960
nothing and they look better if you're doing video because they obscure your face less

11:01.960 --> 11:06.640
than the other type which is kind of the arm type as I call it that clamps to the mic stand

11:06.640 --> 11:12.880
and then it's a circle with a kind of thin layer of foam usually that you can move around

11:12.880 --> 11:17.520
and put in front of the microphone. Now they're better if you're only doing audio but maybe

11:17.520 --> 11:23.640
the foam round type that fits over the mic is better if you're doing video.

11:23.640 --> 11:28.340
So once you've got your gear sorted you want to record your actual podcast. Now I'm assuming

11:28.340 --> 11:32.240
that most people will be doing this remote. It's kind of a little bit different if you're

11:32.240 --> 11:37.960
doing it in person but it's more likely that you're going to find compatible people online

11:37.960 --> 11:42.000
and that's kind of how most Linux podcasts are done these days so let's assume you're

11:42.000 --> 11:46.680
doing that. I'm not going to talk about any software specifically. I'm going to try and

11:46.680 --> 11:51.520
talk about principles here because it doesn't matter whether you're using something like

11:51.520 --> 11:58.680
Audacity or Ardour or Reaper or GarageBand or whatever it is you're using. The principles

11:58.680 --> 12:04.440
are roughly the same. Now what we always do when we record a podcast is make sure that

12:04.440 --> 12:09.040
we're all recording and then we record some absolute silence. If you've ever caught Linux

12:09.040 --> 12:13.880
Unplugged live you will have listened to this. Now the reason that you record absolute silence

12:13.880 --> 12:20.760
is it's not actually silent. When you stop talking you stop moving you stop breathing

12:20.760 --> 12:28.640
what you record is hiss, hum, buzz, all the stuff that you want rid of. Now if you record

12:28.640 --> 12:35.460
a bit of absolute silence for say five or ten seconds then you can use noise removal

12:35.460 --> 12:41.360
software to get rid of all that hiss that you don't want. I use Audacity for this but

12:41.360 --> 12:45.600
there are tons of other ways of doing it but the principle is always the same. You need

12:45.600 --> 12:50.800
to train the algorithm on the silence the stuff that you want rid of and then apply

12:50.800 --> 12:56.080
that to the whole recording. I cannot stress enough how important it is for this silence

12:56.080 --> 13:01.920
to be absolute silence. If you're training an algorithm on what you want to remove and

13:01.920 --> 13:09.620
you leave in scratching of neck beards or shuffling feet or breathing then it's going

13:09.620 --> 13:15.440
to detract from the sound quality of what is left after you've removed that noise. That's

13:15.440 --> 13:20.960
why whenever I come to do my noise removal I listen to the absolute silence and make

13:20.960 --> 13:25.640
sure that it is just the hiss and buzz and everything we want rid of and that there is

13:25.640 --> 13:31.280
no breathing or whatever. I do that by turning the volume up to the absolute max that I can

13:31.280 --> 13:36.240
get it and then I listen out for just even little sounds and try and select a bit of

13:36.240 --> 13:42.240
that audio that is just the silence that you want rid of. That's why it's very important

13:42.240 --> 13:48.440
to capture that silence properly in the first place. Assuming that your recording all went

13:48.440 --> 13:52.480
well and everyone has sent you their flack or wave file or whatever and you line them

13:52.480 --> 13:57.840
up in Audacity or whatever software you're using one of the first things that you'll

13:57.840 --> 14:04.880
probably want to do is EQ equalization. There are various different types of EQ plugin but

14:04.880 --> 14:10.160
the type that I like the best is parametric EQ because that is a good visual representation

14:10.160 --> 14:15.000
of all of the audio frequencies. Generally speaking on the left that's going to be the

14:15.000 --> 14:22.080
lower frequencies and then on the right it's going to be the higher frequencies. So usually

14:22.080 --> 14:28.280
they go way lower than humans can even hear to real sub bass on the left and then to really

14:28.280 --> 14:34.300
high pitched frequencies which if you're a little bit older like me you can't hear anymore.

14:34.300 --> 14:41.160
Now the basic EQ that I use is just cutting the low end the real low end boom as I call

14:41.160 --> 14:48.080
it and we're talking about the real bassiness here of a person's voice. The reason that

14:48.080 --> 14:54.760
I do that is because people who listen in a car to podcasts which is quite common their

14:54.760 --> 14:58.560
car stereos tend to have a lot of bass in them and if there's too much rumbling bass

14:58.560 --> 15:02.780
in someone's voice then it makes it very difficult to hear what they're actually saying because

15:02.780 --> 15:07.800
it's just boom and rumble rather than the bits that you want to hear of their voice.

15:07.800 --> 15:16.060
Once I've done that then it's a case of either boosting or cutting various frequencies depending

15:16.060 --> 15:23.240
on the quality of the recording how that compares to other people's voices and I tend to be

15:23.240 --> 15:29.960
quite sparing with EQ because it's quite easy to mess it up and make it sound terrible.

15:29.960 --> 15:36.360
Drew tends to use more EQ than I do and this is something that is a real art rather than

15:36.360 --> 15:41.680
science this is what you want it to sound like and the only real way to know what you

15:41.680 --> 15:45.600
want it to sound like is to experiment and maybe there might be a particular frequency

15:45.600 --> 15:49.760
that you want rid of or maybe someone's kind of muffled and you want to boost the high

15:49.760 --> 15:55.680
end it's too individual for me to tell you exactly how to do it unfortunately.

15:55.680 --> 16:01.600
The next thing is compression now we're not talking about compression like zip compression

16:01.600 --> 16:07.040
or mp3 compression we're talking about dynamic compression that means that the parts where

16:07.040 --> 16:10.560
it's really loud will become quieter and the parts where it's really quiet will become

16:10.560 --> 16:17.440
louder and it makes everything roughly the same volume now much like with EQ the right

16:17.440 --> 16:24.120
level of compression is very much subjective if you listen to the radio they tend to use

16:24.120 --> 16:29.960
a lot of compression and I mean a lot to the point where someone yelling at the top of

16:29.960 --> 16:35.120
their voice would be the same volume as if they're whispering into the microphone there's

16:35.120 --> 16:41.360
real divided opinion on this I tend to use quite a lot of compression as I said because

16:41.360 --> 16:46.280
I think about people driving in their cars again if there are too many dynamics in the

16:46.280 --> 16:52.640
volume of the podcast then it makes it difficult to listen to because you're constantly having

16:52.640 --> 16:56.600
to turn it up and then the next person speaks really loud and you have to turn that down

16:56.600 --> 17:02.520
again or someone might have inconsistency in the level that they are talking and compression

17:02.520 --> 17:09.080
is a quick and dirty fix for that but it does have a sound in of itself so again it's something

17:09.080 --> 17:14.560
you have to experiment with the more you compress it the more it's going to sound like radio

17:14.560 --> 17:20.840
some people like their mixes to breathe they like it to have a lot of dynamic in it but

17:20.840 --> 17:25.920
personally I would rather use a little bit too much compression than not enough and so

17:25.920 --> 17:30.800
the final thing is editing now some people record live to tape line it all up export

17:30.800 --> 17:38.120
it job done that's not what I tend to do I tend to go through and edit it properly this

17:38.120 --> 17:42.880
could be a whole episode in of itself how to actually do editing but I'll give you a

17:42.880 --> 17:51.040
few tips that I always give people the first is leave a beat and by that I mean if you

17:51.040 --> 17:58.200
get to the end of a sentence there's usually a cap between that sentence and the next sentence

17:58.200 --> 18:03.080
if you listen to me now I'm leaving pauses there because that's how humans talk a very

18:03.080 --> 18:08.720
common mistake that people make is doing the cut at the end of a sentence and then they

18:08.720 --> 18:12.840
cut from the beginning of the next sentence and then they mash them together so there

18:12.840 --> 18:18.080
is no gap between them I'll give you a very quick example of that now I'll now speak the

18:18.080 --> 18:22.520
next sentence and then I'll speak the next sentence and then I'll speak the next sentence

18:22.520 --> 18:27.440
as I recorded that I left a standard pause like you'd expect in any human conversation

18:27.440 --> 18:32.560
but you hear how that sounded a bit weird well that is a mistake that a lot of people

18:32.560 --> 18:37.340
make it's almost become a style on YouTube now there are huge YouTubers whose style is

18:37.340 --> 18:42.840
like that and I cannot watch their videos because it's just too annoying it's too frantic

18:42.840 --> 18:49.560
every time they edit they don't leave the beat in there and it's it's kind of younger

18:49.560 --> 18:54.600
people maybe get off my lawn whatever I don't know maybe people like to listen to audio

18:54.600 --> 19:00.720
that is edited like that I certainly don't another tip is don't cut off breaths I suppose

19:00.720 --> 19:05.620
I will give you an example of that now if you cut off the breath there you hear that

19:05.620 --> 19:10.740
sounds a bit weird the best way if you are doing a cut that involves a breath is to use

19:10.740 --> 19:17.040
fades fading in and fading out but again that takes a bit of practice the final tip when

19:17.040 --> 19:23.380
it comes to editing is listen back in full because things can go wrong you may get through

19:23.380 --> 19:27.800
your edit and you think you've done everything perfectly and you export it and then you publish

19:27.800 --> 19:31.360
it and then you go to bed and then you wake up to a bunch of comments saying well what

19:31.360 --> 19:37.100
was that weird bit in there or how come there was no audio on the left channel for 20 minutes

19:37.100 --> 19:43.160
or whatever I think that it is a disrespect to the audience to not listen back how do

19:43.160 --> 19:47.540
you expect them to listen to your whole show if you can't even be bothered to do it yourself

19:47.540 --> 19:52.680
yes it adds the length of the show to the process so if you're doing a two-hour show

19:52.680 --> 19:57.220
then that's two hours of listen back but I think you've got to do it and I think that's

19:57.220 --> 20:04.040
what sets apart people who care from people who don't and my final tip here is don't mess

20:04.040 --> 20:09.720
with your recording machine we in the Linux world like to distro hop a lot and try out

20:09.720 --> 20:15.440
different desktop environments and try new software all the time I do not recommend that

20:15.440 --> 20:21.000
I recommend if at all possible whether it's a partition or a physical machine get it so

20:21.000 --> 20:26.540
it's working and leave it that way get another laptop pick up a cheap think pad or something

20:26.540 --> 20:30.920
if you want to mess around with different distros set yourself up with a machine that

20:30.920 --> 20:36.820
works and just leave it that way because there is nothing more upsetting to the creative

20:36.820 --> 20:42.140
process than technical difficulties you sit down to record something like I decided to

20:42.140 --> 20:47.600
sit down and record this today if I had had technical issues it would have been very frustrating

20:47.600 --> 20:52.400
and would have probably led to me not recording this whereas I have a setup that I know works

20:52.400 --> 20:59.960
I plug in my various equipment start recording simple so don't mess with your recording machine

20:59.960 --> 21:04.760
so well done if you made it this far with me rambling about all this stuff like I said

21:04.760 --> 21:09.860
at the beginning these are just my opinions and there may be stuff that you can teach

21:09.860 --> 21:14.480
me and if you can great get in touch let's start a conversation about this because I'm

21:14.480 --> 21:19.360
always willing to learn and also let me know if you want more detail or specifics on any

21:19.360 --> 21:48.280
of the topics that are covered here at Joe Rissington on Twitter or extras.show.com
