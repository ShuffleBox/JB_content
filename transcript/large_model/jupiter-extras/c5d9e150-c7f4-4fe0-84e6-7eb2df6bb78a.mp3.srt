1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
respectful of the University of British Columbia andloop

2
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:47,200
Welcome to a very special extra, man do you remember when we used to play this song for

3
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
way too long?

4
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,200
It's so long!

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,880
It is really long, and then the other egregious thing we'd do is we'd play the music for like

6
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,960
a full minute and a half under us while we did the show.

7
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,840
It's the slow fade out.

8
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,640
Well, we actually just were sitting down to put together another fantastic episode of

9
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
the Unplugged program.

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,200
You know, it comes out every week.

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,040
I did a little behind the scenes on the Chris Lass cast recently, and then I think it got

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,160
in the back of my head that maybe we should do a full blown legit extra on this.

13
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:22,380
And so while we were show prepping, we thought, well, let's talk about what goes into a show.

14
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,380
We're here doing it right now.

15
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,920
Let's sit down and record this.

16
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,040
And we thought, wouldn't it be fun to kind of look back because Linux Unplugged was launched

17
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,000
on August 12th, 2013.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,640
That's like seven years ago.

19
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,000
Seven years.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,760
And a lot has changed in actually what the show looks like and sounds like.

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,240
Seven years on the internet might as well be 30.

22
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,720
It was a different internet back in 2013.

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
It was.

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,840
It was a very different Linux Unplugged.

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,920
See Linux Unplugged started as a concept to relieve a problem I had in Linux Action Show,

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,720
and that was too much damn email, and I felt really guilty that I wasn't getting to all

27
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,240
of the emails coming into the big show.

28
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,800
And so I thought, I know what I'll do.

29
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,520
I'll create a podcast where I read emails.

30
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,800
It was it was a rough concept, but you know, Matt Hartley was down to clown on this idea.

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,440
And so we jumped on mic.

32
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,280
We launched with our virtual log on Hangouts.

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
The audio quality was atrocious.

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,280
Wow.

35
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
I'm glad I missed this episode.

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
All right.

37
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
This is embarrassing.

38
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
But I'm gonna play this for you.

39
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
OK.

40
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,920
This is gonna this is gonna be this is gonna hurt me because I sound like I'm on helium

41
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,280
and I'm going a million miles per hour.

42
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,560
So it's it's really tough.

43
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,700
You are just young and excited about Linux Hangout.

44
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,680
So far, we're a little hit and miss.

45
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,140
But we'll bring that we'll bring in the panel that we have assembled later in the show as

46
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,140
we get going.

47
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,280
But first, I want to just take a minute and talk about the new show.

48
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,840
We don't plan to do this too often, but it's kind of an opportunity to talk about ourselves

49
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,840
a little bit.

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,600
Matt and I were kind of brainstorming on a couple of problems that the Linux Action Show

51
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
has faced.

52
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,760
And one has been that we just have this torrential amount of feedback that we generate every

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,240
single week from every single show and ideas sometimes on how to do something differently

54
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,040
than how we talked about in the show.

55
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Whoa, bro, slow down.

56
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,140
I don't even know.

57
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,640
And I can't even do it now.

58
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,280
And ideas we had talked about to do it in another show, like it's like I can't even.

59
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,680
I mean, you were streaming it live after all.

60
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
Yeah.

61
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,720
You got to be got to be on your game when you're live.

62
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,280
Or maybe you were nervous.

63
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
We were on it.

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,280
Google Plus Hangouts.

65
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,280
Big audience.

66
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,120
It's it's hey, did you actually know that maybe that's not the best way to do it or

67
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
anything like that?

68
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
Right.

69
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,120
Exactly.

70
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,400
And trying to find a way to present that in a way that wasn't going to just actually become

71
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
a time suck.

72
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Right.

73
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
Yeah.

74
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Because it would drag down the whole show.

75
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Exactly.

76
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
And I had I had threatened for like a long time.

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,880
I was like, one of these days, Matt, I'm going to make a feedback show and also kind of talk

78
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,120
about his feedback.

79
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
Even my old man.

80
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Yeah.

81
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,120
That's gotten a lot better.

82
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,520
That sounds like my old man's way better now.

83
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
Much older.

84
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:52,240
What's so sad about it is we don't even have to do like some sort of musical transition

85
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:58,040
between old clips and new clips because it's so patently obvious which one is young Chris

86
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
and which one's old Chris.

87
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
Oh, yeah.

88
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,000
And this is 100 episodes before you join the show.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,140
So it was Matt and I just riffing.

90
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,700
That's kind of what we're doing, although that's not the show in its entirety.

91
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,240
That's only going to be a component of this show.

92
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,060
You know, I mean, the feedback, I think, is going to generate a lot of good discussion

93
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,480
and a lot of ideas.

94
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,620
But I'm hoping that this show is even more of an opportunity to kind of get down into

95
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,620
some episodes.

96
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,760
I want to just like totally just dig into a topic and we're just going to only talk

97
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,160
about really just that.

98
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,800
And maybe we'll just spend an hour discussing something, just really go deep.

99
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,180
Sometimes I want to just be all over the board and just talk about topics that have come

100
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,520
up throughout the week, things that people want to bring up, you know, do panel discussions

101
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,720
kind of like we're going to try in this episode.

102
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,400
That kind of has bared out to a degree or other.

103
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,960
In some ways, that's the core of the show.

104
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,120
It's funny because the arc of the show, which we'll talk about in a moment, didn't actually

105
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,120
go that way.

106
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
It's funny to me.

107
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,580
Have me say that episode one, the show ends up not going in that direction.

108
00:04:53,580 --> 00:05:00,120
But now here we are, I think we just were recording 341 or 342, 343.

109
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,560
And we're now more closer to what I'm talking about here than we were 100, 200 episodes

110
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
ago.

111
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,560
That's weird.

112
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,200
Some ideas take a long time.

113
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
I'm real slow, Wes.

114
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,360
I'm a I'm a slow approach, you know, you know, I don't win the race.

115
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,280
But I get there eventually.

116
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,360
I don't know.

117
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,960
There's no excuse for it other than I think we'll actually talk about it.

118
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,720
We'll talk about there's a couple of things that came up that sort of affected the show's

119
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,720
evolution.

120
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,200
But let's go back to that first episode.

121
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,720
I'm pretty excited about the prospect of it.

122
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,080
I think it's going to be interesting to see how this comes to fruition, which direction

123
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,240
we end up taking it and really where the chat room guides us to.

124
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
Yeah.

125
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,000
And what from this will kind of surface up into the big show and make that an even better

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
show.

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,440
And I'm looking forward to it.

128
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,760
But I wanted to start, I thought, with the most classiest way.

129
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,760
And that would be me complaining.

130
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,560
Always, always a classy, a classy approach.

131
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
Right.

132
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,400
Like whenever you want to impress people, the new show, the first thing you want to

133
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,240
do is try to offend a good subset of your potential listeners.

134
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,000
That's Podcaster 101.

135
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Everybody knows that.

136
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,360
I don't know why more shows don't do this.

137
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
It's glad.

138
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,720
I'm glad I nailed the essentials.

139
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
Even back then.

140
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,520
Yeah, that's a policy we follow today.

141
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,720
Do you know what I was upset about?

142
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,480
Do you have a guess?

143
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,920
It's a classic love topic.

144
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
System D?

145
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,920
No, because there was no System D then.

146
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,560
But this is pre, oh, it's 2013, right?

147
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Yeah.

148
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
I'll give you a hint.

149
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,120
It has to do with a reoccurring problem back then in a desktop environment.

150
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Wi-Fi?

151
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,640
It wasn't quite, Wi-Fi wasn't quite so bad in 2013.

152
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,480
But audio, particularly under plasma, was a real problem back then.

153
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,000
And so I was about to get in a good old too much choices causing this.

154
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,160
You would never complain about desktop Linux.

155
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
No, no.

156
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,720
It was one of those, this problem ultimately comes down to too much choice and we rely

157
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
on that.

158
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,040
I mean, it was a decent early rough rant.

159
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,440
You were still kind of honing the soapbox.

160
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,200
Oh man, the Hangout Audio 2 was so bad.

161
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,600
I'm so much happier with Mumble.

162
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,640
And we had, in the pre-show, we had Rando stop by.

163
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,700
They were just like browsing Google Plus, Windows users who were like, what, you bunch

164
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,240
of Linux geeks.

165
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,240
We had weird drive-bys.

166
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,120
Are you saying maybe we should start streaming on Hangouts again?

167
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
Well, yeah.

168
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
I mean, definitely.

169
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
It seems obvious.

170
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,100
Let's get Google Plus back up.

171
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,560
There was also, I'm surprised, we had ads in the very first episode, which from like

172
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,680
a getting my business together standpoint.

173
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
Impressive.

174
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Yeah.

175
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,680
In 2013, the business was enough together that I launched a show with ads.

176
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,640
But the ad itself, you're not going to believe it.

177
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Oh, I'm excited.

178
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,100
But look, here's something else that I worry about, and our next sponsor is going to help

179
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,920
you solve a problem that is becoming more and more of a concern for a lot of us with

180
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:49,000
a lot of the recent NSA revelations going on, ProXPN, a VPN provider in 2013, way ahead

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
of the trade.

182
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Way ahead.

183
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But listen to this read.

184
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,360
They are what I think is becoming one of the up-and-coming premier VPN solution providers.

185
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,280
They got all types of VPNs, great VPNs.

186
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,040
The best VPNs, great VPNs.

187
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
This is way ahead of the curve.

188
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,740
I was shilling VPNs Trump style before it was cool.

189
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,160
It's got all the VPNs, the greatest VPNs, the best encryption.

190
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,880
Do you still have your ProXPN account?

191
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,520
I don't think so.

192
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,740
OpenVPN, which obviously I'm a huge fan of.

193
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,740
Huge fan of OpenVPN.

194
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,740
Huge fan.

195
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,740
Of course.

196
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,800
So if you haven't thought about why you might want a VPN, obviously the first is to kind

197
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,000
of protect your identity online, and the other would be to keep what you're doing private.

198
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's funny because I just recently, in one of our team meetings, was like, when we were

199
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,400
considering doing a piece on VPNs, and I was like, I want us to discuss the fact that fear

200
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,520
mongering is being used to sell these VPNs, and the VPNs add consolidation of traffic,

201
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,960
which we should definitely look at as another potential security vulnerability.

202
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,120
And then here I am, in episode one, doing that.

203
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
I remember how this came about.

204
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,360
It was a new partner we were trying that got an ad slot for me.

205
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,140
It was like a one or two time deal, and we were just testing it.

206
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,040
And now listening back to it, I'm like, oh man, I'm so glad we didn't stick with this.

207
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,680
Because you don't remember me doing this, right?

208
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,240
This is what I tried and stopped doing it.

209
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,600
Even though you might be VPNing to somewhere else, it might eventually get monitored.

210
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,560
It's at least one step removed.

211
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,120
Oh, I guess I was at least, old Chris also worried about it.

212
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,240
Listen, this might not be that effective, but if you think you want a VPN, buy this

213
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
one.

214
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,280
I got to give myself credit for at least addressing the traffic, since I just raised that.

215
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
I forgot.

216
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
Wow.

217
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
I'm proud of myself right there.

218
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,920
I at least said, hey, you are centralizing your traffic.

219
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,140
To put yourself physically in another location.

220
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:33,840
So maybe if you need to be over across the pond, either side of that pond, ProXpn can

221
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,160
help you do that.

222
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,220
And we've got a great deal for ProXpn.

223
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,960
When you go to ProXpn.com and you decide to buy, you can take 20% off the lifetime of

224
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,960
your purchase.

225
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,320
And I think their base rate's only like seven bucks a month.

226
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
It's super cheap.

227
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
It's crazy cheap.

228
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Yeah.

229
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Yeah.

230
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Solid contribution there by Matt Hartley.

231
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,960
Thanks, Matt.

232
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,480
I like, I just, I think it's so funny that there's so many VPN ads and they're basically

233
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,000
using those same, be more secure online, watch content that's not in your region.

234
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,080
It's great.

235
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,320
So there I was.

236
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:13,040
But I obviously had a lot to learn and took a lot of experimental trajectories.

237
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,760
One of them was bringing in a live chat, which you would think would be ridiculous.

238
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,280
Live audio open to the internet.

239
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,840
Honestly, I'd shoot that idea down today.

240
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,100
And so there was a lot of experimentation in format, including trying to create and

241
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,920
cultivate a show that felt really low key.

242
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,240
And this is, these are people that love Linux and we're just hanging out.

243
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,400
And part of that was the realization that we should probably have a little bit of a

244
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,880
pre-show, a warmup, get a conversation going with folks.

245
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,360
And we were digging through the archive and we found one more clip that I think is the

246
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,320
most embarrassing clip of them all, worse than the ad.

247
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:57,480
In episode 67, I don't know what was wrong with us, but we had a five plus minute pre-show

248
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,920
where we were rambling on about something that I actually couldn't tell you what we

249
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,040
were talking about.

250
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,160
Obviously highly relevant to Linux Unplugged.

251
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,440
Started with zero context and listening back, I'm like, I have no idea what we're talking

252
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
about.

253
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
I don't want to listen to this.

254
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,160
And then it goes on for five minutes.

255
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,320
I still don't grok the context.

256
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:21,240
And then, then the real tragedy happens, my worst introduction in Linux Unplugged history.

257
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:31,980
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's celebrating its cheat day.

258
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,560
My name is Chris.

259
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
And my name is Matt.

260
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
Hey Matt.

261
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:39,680
So it's been a few weeks, almost a month, that I just have been kind of going like really

262
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,200
light on the breads and stuff, not like 100% cut it out, but what am I doing?

263
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,160
You know, you never give us diet updates at the start of the show anymore.

264
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,800
What could have, five minutes of incomprehensible talk followed by an introduction where I talk

265
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,560
about cutting bread out of my diet?

266
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
What am I doing?

267
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,760
This is, 2020 Chris looks back at that and I would never start a Linux podcast this way.

268
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,080
And I must have been trying to just like keep it super cash, but I obviously went way too

269
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,940
far on the old cash lever.

270
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,760
Really light, you know, just really going back to that, getting back to that.

271
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,280
And it's, oh, it's been great, Matt, it's been great.

272
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,040
But today before the show, we're working on something huge for tomorrow.

273
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,360
And I don't, you know, it's like in this last stage where it's the most work and you don't

274
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,520
know if you're going to make it in time, but we have something really big for the Jupiter

275
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,520
Broadcasting Network tomorrow that we're working on today.

276
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,820
The compression is horrible.

277
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,080
The audio quality is subpar.

278
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,120
It's funny, you know, I recognize it because I listened during this stage of Linux Unbugged.

279
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,080
It doesn't sound like you, but it still sounds eerily familiar.

280
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:49,640
The music is still playing and by this, this is like six and a half minutes into the show,

281
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,600
actually longer because the intro music went on forever.

282
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
And we still are not talking about Linux.

283
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,120
Like this would be considered like an egregious error in 2020.

284
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,880
But I'm like starving and I'm like, okay, I got to order a Jimmy John sandwich.

285
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
What am I doing?

286
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,880
I can't leave.

287
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,880
You've been listening to the radio.

288
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:11,080
No, it's just like, I know I got to get this work done and then I got to go do the Unplugged

289
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
show.

290
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
I got to go do the Unplugged show.

291
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,760
So I figure I'll order Jimmy John's, but I'm going to be a good boy.

292
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
Lettuce wrap that sandwich.

293
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,760
I'm going to get a lettuce wrap.

294
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,800
I am still talking about the bread stuff.

295
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,960
We got to be eight minutes into the show, real showtime here.

296
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,440
How do I sell ads for this?

297
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,560
Yeah, a little roughage, sure.

298
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,720
So I order Rekai's sandwich because you know, he's working on this project with me and I

299
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,840
order myself a nice big lettuce wrap.

300
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
Double up on that meat, Matt.

301
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
I get double up on that meat.

302
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,840
What's happening?

303
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
What is happening?

304
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,840
Giving like a Jimmy John's ad.

305
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
I know.

306
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,840
I'm like talking about meat.

307
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,480
What is happening?

308
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,640
And it shows up at the front door.

309
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
I grab the bag.

310
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,640
I go upstairs.

311
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
We get all situated in our offices.

312
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,480
We sit down and we start working again.

313
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,480
And you know what?

314
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
What, Chris?

315
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,680
Please, please let it be about Linux.

316
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,200
Please be about Linux.

317
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
They put it on bread.

318
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:07,200
And at that point, Matt, I was so hungry and I've been wanting a sandwich so bad, Matt.

319
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
I've been wanting a sandwich so bad.

320
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,920
I ate the whole sandwich, Matt.

321
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,760
And I got a little bit, I think if I went to the doctor right now, they would say, Chris,

322
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,480
you are clinically diagnosed with food coma.

323
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,720
Am I trying to be a stand up right now?

324
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,940
With like a 10 minute lead up to a job?

325
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:28,860
Clearly this like whole sandwich debacle was a major part of your day and all you could

326
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,860
think about.

327
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,240
I'm like, I'm just free flowing.

328
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,440
I'm going with my id.

329
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,120
You are currently in a state of food coma.

330
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,580
So we're going to get through today's episode.

331
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,520
It's going to be kind of a thick episode.

332
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,840
There's a lot of things going on with the Debian project.

333
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,160
Oh, there it is.

334
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Finally.

335
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,720
How long do you think that was into the show?

336
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,160
Got to be dang near nine minutes.

337
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Probably.

338
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
It doesn't even sound like you want it.

339
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,200
We're going to get through this episode.

340
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,960
Doesn't sound like you want to do the episode.

341
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,360
That is so embarrassing.

342
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
That is.

343
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
I'm like in tears.

344
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
That's so embarrassing.

345
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Wow.

346
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
There's nobody that would say that.

347
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
Say, what are you doing?

348
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
What are you doing, man?

349
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,360
Stop it.

350
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
Well, lesson learned.

351
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,800
I guess we did learn over time.

352
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,880
We've tightened up a bit.

353
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
We have.

354
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,240
There was really sort of the middle years that came after that where the show got really

355
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,240
news heavy.

356
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,140
It was almost all news from top to bottom with a little bit of feedback.

357
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,840
There's a real transition point in there where the feedback and the follow up, which we started

358
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,480
every Unplugged with, moved to the end of the show.

359
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,680
And then as a little time went on, it just kind of became less and less.

360
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,280
We're making more effort to bring it back.

361
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,720
Yeah, there's sort of a feedback comeback.

362
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,880
Yeah, there is a feedback comeback now, but there was a transition where we just went

363
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,440
to sort of a topical discussion show because it was easy for the virtual lug to have opinions

364
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,440
about.

365
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
Right.

366
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,440
This is stuff they could all reference.

367
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
There's articles written up about it.

368
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,900
And I mean, you know, this was still during the Linux action show era for a lot of this.

369
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,200
And so, you know, you guys were doing big projects and had interviews there.

370
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,040
There was no Linux action news yet.

371
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,080
So there was a little more room on the network, too.

372
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,120
Well, not only that, but there wasn't nearly as many Linux podcasts.

373
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,680
So there's less people doing the news.

374
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,440
But also, there's a reality to it is I didn't have a team back then.

375
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,280
It was people with their volunteer time.

376
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,580
So a news show where you just have a group of people talk about the news is easy compared

377
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:21,040
to anything where you're building something or you're installing something or you're testing

378
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,500
something or you're benchmarking something.

379
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,760
It all takes exponentially more time than keeping track of the news, formulating an

380
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,520
opinion and then jotting down some notes and then repeating those opinions into a mic.

381
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
Right.

382
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
And everyone can sort of collaborate.

383
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
Right.

384
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,600
Everyone sort of pitches news stories and you just got to pick through them.

385
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,720
And opinions are easy to come by.

386
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,760
Oh, yeah.

387
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,960
So then it really becomes, well, is there something about your opinion?

388
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,840
Is it informed by a certain angle?

389
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,480
Is there something about your opinion that is special?

390
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,240
And the reality is, when you just have a large group of topics and a large group of people,

391
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,100
you kind of just kind of end up with the same standard conversations.

392
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,480
That was sort of the middle age of the show.

393
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,280
And I think it worked for a period.

394
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,280
And also, I think, marked some of the transition to Linux Unplugged also being something of

395
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,680
an online Linux users group.

396
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,920
You know, we started thinking of the show that more as we bonded, got some regulars

397
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
in there.

398
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,440
That was a big part of it is having some regulars that pop in from time to time.

399
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,940
And then a big moment for us that shifted us into a more news-focused era, like that

400
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,200
middle layer of LUP as it sits right now, was SystemD.

401
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,680
SystemD sort of tracks all the way back to early LUP, like the 20s, but it really built

402
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,000
over time and it became a story that we kind of kept checking in.

403
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,440
And it's still sort of true today, really, that I looked at the Linux action show as

404
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,280
Star Trek The Next Generation, and I looked at Linux Unplugged as Deep Space Nine, where

405
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,600
Deep Space Nine had ongoing narratives through multiple episodes.

406
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,680
We're checking back in on things, following up.

407
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,440
Yeah, we could have a topic take two or three episodes sometimes, whereas last was showcase,

408
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,440
you're done.

409
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,160
That episode is self-contained, much like Star Trek The Next Generation was.

410
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,880
Different products of different eras.

411
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,040
And the SystemD conversation, I think, really cemented that format and sent us down the

412
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
news path for a while.

413
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,760
Well, and it was, you know, at that time, there was a lot of shake-ups.

414
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,160
The news had big news in it.

415
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,880
And I think it was useful, frankly, we kind of needed to talk about it, right?

416
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,800
We were going to be talking about it anyway, it was this big change that was happening

417
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,080
from the outside.

418
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,860
So I think it was useful for the show to have an outlet like that.

419
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:28,720
And it was a moment for us to realize, hey, if we take the extra time to really read both

420
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,600
sides of this, try to understand how it works from a technology perspective, try to figure

421
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,940
out, okay, what's the motivation for this massive change?

422
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,400
What problem is it solving?

423
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,600
Now can we communicate that to the audience in a way that is relatable and understandable?

424
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,120
And SystemD taught us, I think, in a big way how to do that over its run.

425
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
Right.

426
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,680
While we may even like or want to use SystemD, you also have to acknowledge the design flaws

427
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,040
or things that just aren't done in the way that you would like them to be done.

428
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,580
Now I think as time has gone on, we have the news component, but it could be sometimes

429
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,960
no more than one or two stories.

430
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,760
And then there's a mix of conversation pieces in there.

431
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,880
But this has now transitioned as we've become full-time at doing this, we've tried to level

432
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,680
up the amount of time we spend prepping an episode of Linux Unplugged, and it's put some

433
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,280
pressure on us.

434
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,080
But it's pressure I think we're happy to carry because we're trying to, in every episode,

435
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,000
create some original coverage.

436
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yes.

437
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,400
Well, there's things that we need to talk about as a community that aren't always timely

438
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
with the news, right?

439
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,840
That just change on different scales or are too complicated to be really written up in

440
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,520
the sort of shallow textile.

441
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
Yeah.

442
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,580
And we have a pretty good list of contacts now.

443
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,740
So when there's something going on with WireGuard, we've been able to email the WireGuard author

444
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,560
or when Nebula from Slack was launched as their peer-to-peer VPN solution, although

445
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,120
I don't think they like to call it that, we're able to get that developer on the line.

446
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,480
And in fact, something we did with that episode that I really liked is we had the Tink developer.

447
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,080
Gus Koos?

448
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,080
Yes.

449
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,080
Yes.

450
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,080
Good memory, Wes.

451
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,280
And that was such a neat episode because it's like, here's two products that are in the

452
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,040
open source ecosystem.

453
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,440
One is brand new to the scene and one's been here for a decade.

454
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,800
How do they solve this problem differently coming at it from these two different eras?

455
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,700
And I really enjoyed that kind of stuff.

456
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,200
That's the kind of stuff we try to do now more of that we couldn't really afford to

457
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,760
do in all of the senses of the word when people were volunteering their time.

458
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,400
And then you came around in episode 100 when we had that barbecue and just hit the ground

459
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
running.

460
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,920
You know, it's been too long since we've fired up that old barbecue.

461
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,660
That is for serious, Wes.

462
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,240
That is for real serious, especially when we've had a couple of surprise nice days.

463
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,720
It's ridiculous.

464
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
So here's what we do.

465
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,160
We get a couple of wireless mics that we can, you know, attach to our shirts.

466
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,680
We get a little outdoor grill cam.

467
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
Sure.

468
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,680
And that's the pre-show.

469
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,080
I mean, I think we tried that once before.

470
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,840
I mean, the barbecue is steeped in tradition on the show.

471
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,040
It's a touchstone element that we need to get back to as part of this self-reflection

472
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,640
process we were doing now and we have been doing recently with this show.

473
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,320
We need to get that barbecue element in there.

474
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,760
I think it's pretty important.

475
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,200
A lot of the work, all of the work, all of the work proportionally for Linux Unplugged

476
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,560
is before we ever sit down on the microphones.

477
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,040
And it really, I mean, it almost never stops in a sense.

478
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,720
Once one episode is recorded, there's another one.

479
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,520
You got to kick off planning for the next.

480
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,520
And the more intricate and more, you know, if you want a guest or if you want to set

481
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,120
stand some stack of software.

482
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
Right.

483
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,800
Are you going to try something that you really need to experiment so you can comment on meaningfully?

484
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,440
Are you going to run a desktop for a week?

485
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,880
Like you got to start basically as soon as we get all of the description done for the

486
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,200
one we just recorded, we start working on the next one.

487
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,260
And that can ramp up depending on the ambition of the show.

488
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,540
Sometimes it means we both go off to our own camps and work.

489
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,920
Sometimes it means we collaborate at the studio like we're doing today.

490
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,000
We both sit down here in the studio and work on something and we try to get as much done

491
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,800
as possible because at noon Pacific, the show starts and it's all live to tape.

492
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,200
Every clip that we play, every sound bite, it's all live.

493
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,600
Every interview, it's all live, done to tape.

494
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,960
And then we're done.

495
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,160
The actual production of the show in a big sense is the least amount of work for us because

496
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,440
we just sit down and talk.

497
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
We've already prepared.

498
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
We know what we're going to say.

499
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,540
We've done it for so long that it's not like we have butterflies.

500
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,760
It's not hard for us to sit down and start talking.

501
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,820
So we got all that.

502
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,960
It's everything we do before then and then it's everything that happens after the show

503
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,880
when we flack out each individual track.

504
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,520
Everybody's recorded on their own individual tracks.

505
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,840
We flack all that up.

506
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,080
We use Nextcloud to send it off to Joe for editing.

507
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,180
That's really worth talking about almost as its own part of the era.

508
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:34,960
When Joe started helping out, started editing Unplugged, I think that was one of our triggers

509
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,400
to realize that we could take things to the next level because we had someone who could

510
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,720
just really improve the quality of the show.

511
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
Yeah, you're right.

512
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,160
Going multi-track and having Joe come on board to help with not just the editing but also

513
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,960
help direct some of the content has been really beneficial because it's brought a critical

514
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,800
air to the show so that way I don't do dumb things like do a five-minute intro talking

515
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,200
about bread.

516
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Could you imagine?

517
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,040
That's kind of never going to happen now.

518
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,900
With the multi-track audio, we can do noise removal for each individual voice.

519
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,720
We can EQ each individual voice.

520
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:15,880
We can really go to the next level of quality that we'd never even gotten near before.

521
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,220
Joe's so dedicated to it that he stays up till way late on his time.

522
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:25,720
He's probably up till 3 a.m., 4 a.m. working on every Linux Unplugged because we don't

523
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,060
start till noon here our time.

524
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,060
That's new.

525
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,640
Yeah, we've tried to move it a little bit to accommodate, but he stays up until the

526
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,640
show's out.

527
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,800
If it's a big show with lots of tracks and extra guests and editing that needs to be

528
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:43,200
done because we did something extra, he's staying up until 5 a.m. to get the show out.

529
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,680
Well, he's also able to get clips ready for us.

530
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,680
If we do have a guest on, he can make sure that's pre-edited and ready for us to just

531
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,080
play live on air, which is very helpful.

532
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,720
Yeah, and he'll match the EQ of the interview so it sounds natural.

533
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,360
It's a nice secret sauce and being dedicated so much to stay up late like that to get it

534
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,040
out so that way it's available the next morning so it's as relevant as possible, it's ready

535
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,040
for the morning commute.

536
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,120
I think it's a big part of why people tune it up because it's right there.

537
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
You know that episode.

538
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,600
If you're listening to it, it's as relevant as physically possible for a show of that

539
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,600
production quality.

540
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,880
So it really has been refining our hosting approach, refining how we interact with the

541
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,320
community, refining our audio production, and then refining what we cover in the show

542
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,440
to try to do more original stuff, more guest interviews.

543
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
We've really gotten pickier.

544
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,960
I mean, I think we have a lot of the same ideas we've always had, but fewer of them

545
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,200
make it because we just have higher standards.

546
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,200
For better or for worse, sometimes it makes us feel like we're a little stuck, but other

547
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,360
times we feel like we've really nailed it and it's like this great, like, oh man, we

548
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,360
really pulled something off there.

549
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
That feels great.

550
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,200
So I think it's very common for this kind of work actually.

551
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,520
I think that's a very common thing.

552
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
You can't stay still, right?

553
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:57,000
I mean, no one else in this space stays still, and if we kept doing the same thing, we'd

554
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
all get bored.

555
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,280
I think we probably can't say enough, though, how important our virtual log has been.

556
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,760
It's been such a huge component, and they've stuck with us throughout this whole show.

557
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,560
We'd love to have you join us live.

558
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,600
We do Linux Unplugged live on Tuesdays at noon Pacific.

559
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,000
You can get it in your local time at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

560
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,760
You know, if you can't make it to the mumble room, we've also got an IRC channel.

561
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,240
We love our chat room.

562
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:25,640
IRC.geekshed.net, pound, Jupiter Broadcasting, Octothorp, Octothorp, yeah, yeah, it's good.

563
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
Hey, guess what?

564
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:53,760
We'll see you next Tuesday!
