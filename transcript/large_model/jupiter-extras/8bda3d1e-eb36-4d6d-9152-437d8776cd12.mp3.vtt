00:00.000 --> 00:14.360
Hello, everyone. This is another episode of Brunch with Brent. I'm joined today by Rocco.

00:14.360 --> 00:15.360
How are you doing, Rocco?

00:15.360 --> 00:17.840
I am doing excellent, Brent. How are you?

00:17.840 --> 00:22.600
I'm actually doing really well. I think you can tell I'm very excited to be chatting with

00:22.600 --> 00:28.880
you. I wanted to mention that you are involved in a whole bunch of really cool stuff, but

00:28.880 --> 00:33.320
you're going to supplement what I have to say. So where I know you the most is from

00:33.320 --> 00:40.600
Linux Spotlight, where you interview a whole bunch of great people in our Linux community,

00:40.600 --> 00:46.560
and some know you as part of the Big Daddy Linux network as well. I mean, those two are

00:46.560 --> 00:51.820
pretty deep rabbit holes of great community stuff, right?

00:51.820 --> 00:59.260
We have a really good community with the Big Daddy Linux live show. It's something that

00:59.260 --> 01:04.400
you can't get anywhere else, where you can get a bunch of people together that talk about

01:04.400 --> 01:07.480
the same stuff that you talk about every day.

01:07.480 --> 01:12.900
For those who have never experienced it, can you give us a little run-through of what happens

01:12.900 --> 01:15.840
every week and who joins and this kind of thing?

01:15.840 --> 01:23.800
Every Saturday at 8 p.m. Eastern, we do a live stream on YouTube and Twitch, where we

01:23.800 --> 01:32.040
just open up a Zoom room and anybody and everybody can join this room. The first hour, we talk

01:32.040 --> 01:36.920
about a Distro challenge that we've been doing for sometimes it's a week, sometimes it's

01:36.920 --> 01:43.920
two weeks. Then the second hour is open to pretty much any other Linux topic that you

01:43.920 --> 01:50.360
can think of, and we get into so much stuff. I mean, we can go really deep into technical

01:50.360 --> 01:57.440
stuff and then just into superficial stuff. We have users that are very technical, some

01:57.440 --> 02:02.160
developers, and there's a lot of names that people would know, and then there's a lot

02:02.160 --> 02:08.400
of people from just normal everyday users from the community that join, and it's such

02:08.400 --> 02:11.360
a mishmash of people, and it's awesome. I love it.

02:11.360 --> 02:17.200
Yeah, well, there's all this synergy that happens between those groups of people, right?

02:17.200 --> 02:21.480
When you have someone from a whole bunch of different backgrounds, you never really know

02:21.480 --> 02:23.600
the conversations that you'll get into, right?

02:23.600 --> 02:29.040
You don't know the conversations, and to be honest with you, you don't know the people

02:29.040 --> 02:36.160
until you learn about them more from the Linux spotlight. There have been people in, and

02:36.160 --> 02:43.120
I'll just highlight Barbara. She is a Biddle community member. She has been on Biddle for,

02:43.120 --> 02:48.920
I don't know, over a year or so, and you get to talk to her. I mean, she'll say things,

02:48.920 --> 02:54.600
she'll interject, and yet it wasn't until Linux spotlight, her episode, that you get

02:54.600 --> 03:00.120
to meet her, learn about her history, learn about all the things that she's done, and

03:00.120 --> 03:04.940
she's an amazing person, and you don't get that in the couple minutes of Biddle, so it's

03:04.940 --> 03:07.680
kind of like goes hand in hand. It's awesome.

03:07.680 --> 03:13.720
It's almost like on Biddle, you get a tiny taste of the person, and then Linux spotlight

03:13.720 --> 03:18.580
is a beautiful place where you can just do deep dives on one person specifically, right?

03:18.580 --> 03:22.800
It's not perfected. You know, Biddle itself is not perfected because you're in a group

03:22.800 --> 03:29.160
of people, and the setting is basically like if you went to a Linux user group or you went

03:29.160 --> 03:35.400
to a, I don't know, a pub somewhere, and you were all sitting around talking about Linux,

03:35.400 --> 03:39.480
so there are times where people get interrupted or whatever, because you're in such a big

03:39.480 --> 03:44.720
conversation with, we get up to 30 people sometimes in the same room.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.360
Yeah, to moderate, right?

03:46.360 --> 03:51.640
That's hard to moderate. It's hard for people to listen to sometimes because along with

03:51.640 --> 03:56.460
that whole idea of having 30 people, there are connection issues sometimes. People will

03:56.460 --> 04:01.360
have a slower connection, so they will hear a delay, so they'll start talking when other

04:01.360 --> 04:08.560
people talk, so that's challenging, but it's so much fun, and I think you should do it

04:08.560 --> 04:10.080
too.

04:10.080 --> 04:16.800
As you know, I haven't experienced it yet, mostly because I would say I tend towards

04:16.800 --> 04:23.220
being quite introverted, maybe to some people's surprise, and so that, I'm definitely going

04:23.220 --> 04:29.160
to come and join, but it's like, okay, I need to sort of from the outside just kind of watch

04:29.160 --> 04:33.160
a little bit for a while and see how it all works, and then I'm going to jump right in,

04:33.160 --> 04:35.560
so I accept your challenge completely.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.680
I would have to call you on that being introverted.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.380
Oh, bring it on.

04:39.380 --> 04:46.680
I have went back and listened to all of the Brunch with Brents, and you make people feel

04:46.680 --> 04:53.480
comfortable when they're talking to you, and that is a special talent that you have, so

04:53.480 --> 04:57.340
I don't believe you're introverted at all.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.920
Maybe I'm just putting on a really good performance.

04:58.920 --> 04:59.920
There you go.

04:59.920 --> 05:07.040
You know, I've explained, I think, before how my main profession is being a photographer,

05:07.040 --> 05:13.500
and in photography, one of the biggest skills that I was handed from a few of my mentors

05:13.500 --> 05:19.420
was the skill of becoming friends with someone in five minutes, because if you're doing a

05:19.420 --> 05:25.080
portrait of someone, you know, I've done a lot of portraits of high-tech executives,

05:25.080 --> 05:31.800
for instance, and people at the Bank of Canada and all that kind of stuff, and so it's someone

05:31.800 --> 05:38.440
you've never met before, but it's really important to make them feel as much at ease as you possibly

05:38.440 --> 05:43.580
can because otherwise you're just not going to get a good photograph, right?

05:43.580 --> 05:47.240
And as you know, podcasting is much the same.

05:47.240 --> 05:54.200
It may not be a photograph, but it's a conversation or some audio, and so I never expected it,

05:54.200 --> 05:59.040
but those skills kind of translate in a really beautiful way, so thank you for picking up

05:59.040 --> 06:00.040
on that.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.040
That's really great.

06:01.040 --> 06:05.360
Those skills do translate into podcasting more than people think because you're a lot

06:05.360 --> 06:13.400
of times interviewing people that you've never spoken to before, never saw before, and that

06:13.400 --> 06:21.680
conversation can start out very rough, and in order to get a good conversation, a good

06:21.680 --> 06:26.240
natural flowing conversation, you need that.

06:26.240 --> 06:29.160
You need what you give people, and that's to feel comfortable.

06:29.160 --> 06:30.160
Well, thanks.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.160
Yeah.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.720
I mean, you have had the same experience.

06:33.720 --> 06:38.920
You know, you were just describing you get to know someone in the Biddle Weekly, but

06:38.920 --> 06:43.520
then when you have them one-on-one, it's kind of a whole different ballgame, isn't it, right?

06:43.520 --> 06:51.600
Like you, especially as the host, there's this way that you need to guide the conversation

06:51.600 --> 06:57.720
in a way, and of course we want it to be authentic and really smooth, but there are those moments

06:57.720 --> 07:01.320
when it's up to you to kind of like keep the air going, right?

07:01.320 --> 07:02.320
Yes.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.200
Some conversations are easier than others.

07:04.200 --> 07:10.360
There are people who talk very well and enjoy talking, and there are other people who just

07:10.360 --> 07:17.560
give you sometimes just like a one-line answer, and if you don't moderate it the right way,

07:17.560 --> 07:22.400
that episode will probably be like 10 minutes long.

07:22.400 --> 07:26.640
Some people only want 10-minute episodes.

07:26.640 --> 07:31.200
So that brings me to a question then, which is you've been doing Linux Spotlight I think

07:31.200 --> 07:37.200
for about like as we record 24 or so episodes now.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.440
What made you want to dive in and have those conversations in the first place?

07:41.440 --> 07:44.440
To be honest with you, it was the Biddle community.

07:44.440 --> 07:48.600
We were discussing one day on Biddle people's history.

07:48.600 --> 07:52.600
Like somebody had brought up, you know, how did you find Linux?

07:52.600 --> 07:58.240
Well, we started talking and we went down the row individually of how this person started

07:58.240 --> 08:03.040
in Linux, and we got like two or three people in, and then the episode would end, and then

08:03.040 --> 08:05.600
we would continue it in the next week.

08:05.600 --> 08:12.520
But I said, man, wouldn't it be cool if there was like one place you could go and find everybody's

08:12.520 --> 08:14.080
history in Linux?

08:14.080 --> 08:19.360
Like if you want to know this person's history or that person's history, I can go to Linux

08:19.360 --> 08:24.280
Spotlight, or at that time it wasn't even born yet, but I can go to this place and find

08:24.280 --> 08:26.880
it and hear about it.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.600
And that's where it all started.

08:28.600 --> 08:36.320
And I ended up doing my friend Zebedee Boss as the first episode, and it just took off

08:36.320 --> 08:44.400
from there of doing community members and other members of the wider Linux community

08:44.400 --> 08:47.200
and then grew into all kinds of people.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.200
Yeah.

08:48.200 --> 08:54.480
I mean, what a great insight that you had to create something like that, because I think

08:54.480 --> 08:55.480
you totally nailed it.

08:55.480 --> 08:59.200
There's a real thirst for getting to know people in our community, and that's sort of

08:59.200 --> 09:02.520
the same taste that you get when you go to some conferences, right?

09:02.520 --> 09:08.920
You get to talk to people one-on-one, if you're lucky, and you have kind of brought that to

09:08.920 --> 09:10.840
a greater audience in a way.

09:10.840 --> 09:14.520
So kudos to you for taking on that initiative.

09:14.520 --> 09:20.120
Like it feels to me like it has so much potential in the sense that our community is huge, and

09:20.120 --> 09:27.520
it's filled with amazing people, and the community that you have surrounding you is slightly

09:27.520 --> 09:31.160
different than the community that I might have surrounding me.

09:31.160 --> 09:38.040
And so it's been fascinating to watch how all of these different people exist out there

09:38.040 --> 09:42.480
that I may have never heard of but are fascinating people, like you were saying, right?

09:42.480 --> 09:48.920
Your first episode is a bit of a leap because it's the first time you try it, but of course

09:48.920 --> 09:52.600
all this magic happens when two great, you know, interesting people get in a room and

09:52.600 --> 09:53.600
just have a chat.

09:53.600 --> 09:58.560
Well, I knew there were awesome people in the community.

09:58.560 --> 10:04.320
I knew that from meeting half these people on Biddle and everywhere else, being on Destination

10:04.320 --> 10:05.520
Linux.

10:05.520 --> 10:12.580
So I met a lot of awesome people, but you don't realize until, well, okay, so I didn't

10:12.580 --> 10:19.040
realize how awesome our community is until you start doing the Linux spotlight and you

10:19.040 --> 10:23.280
see this person, and wow, man, it can't get any better than this, and then the next person

10:23.280 --> 10:27.800
comes along and has a completely different outlook on things, and man, that was such

10:27.800 --> 10:29.540
an awesome conversation.

10:29.540 --> 10:35.280
And then it just keeps building and getting better and better, and it's a gift to me to

10:35.280 --> 10:38.880
be able to talk to so many awesome people out there.

10:38.880 --> 10:42.880
And then a gift right back to the community for you to make those conversations available

10:42.880 --> 10:43.880
to them, right?

10:43.880 --> 10:48.140
Because you get to know these people in a really lovely way, and then at the same time

10:48.140 --> 10:51.760
so does everyone else, which is super amazing.

10:51.760 --> 10:58.720
Well, another side effect to this is, you know, you had mentioned about, you know, our

10:58.720 --> 11:05.520
community and then the community that you're in, and it combines all of them to where all

11:05.520 --> 11:11.440
of the communities can come together and see a little bit of this and a little bit of that,

11:11.440 --> 11:16.640
and we all end up coming together in one place, and that's another great side effect of it.

11:16.640 --> 11:19.200
I will echo that completely.

11:19.200 --> 11:25.760
I believe you've heard the chat that I did with Martin Wimpress, with Wimpy, and his

11:25.760 --> 11:32.080
big ask at the end of our conversation was, he was speaking a little bit more about distributions,

11:32.080 --> 11:36.480
but more so just around these little groups that we form in the Linux community, you know,

11:36.480 --> 11:41.400
oh, I love this distribution, so I'm part of the arch, you know, community or whatever.

11:41.400 --> 11:48.860
And he his big ask was, let's be really kind to each other in the opposite, you know, we

11:48.860 --> 11:50.640
see it as the opposite community.

11:50.640 --> 11:56.920
But the reality is, we are all Linux users, and we all in the real depths of our hearts

11:56.920 --> 11:58.320
believe in the same stuff, right?

11:58.320 --> 12:03.480
So if you have a community somewhere, and there's a community just near you that believes

12:03.480 --> 12:07.680
almost the same stuff, go in there and dive in, like, chances are, they're amazing people

12:07.680 --> 12:08.960
too.

12:08.960 --> 12:13.120
And if we can increase those communities and increase the links that happen between them

12:13.120 --> 12:16.280
all, I feel like that's where the real nuggets are.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.960
And I feel like in many ways, you're, you're making those links happen.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.800
And that's hugely valuable.

12:21.800 --> 12:26.640
So a thank you from the community for what what you're doing, really.

12:26.640 --> 12:32.640
Well, I think it's really important and I don't want to base, I don't want to say the

12:32.640 --> 12:39.580
same thing that Martin said, but I will say that it's a great thing to see different communities

12:39.580 --> 12:45.300
because there was always this and there wasn't there wasn't any walls.

12:45.300 --> 12:50.280
But there was always this is the this community and this is that community and they're, they

12:50.280 --> 12:56.320
all run Linux, but they're all separate kind of, and they all stick to the same community.

12:56.320 --> 13:02.800
And I think that's the one thing that we need to break down is that we are all Linux users.

13:02.800 --> 13:10.040
And we all are not just Linux users, but we all have the same type of direction that we're

13:10.040 --> 13:16.200
going in, because of and surrounding Linux, but it's all let's, let's go forward with

13:16.200 --> 13:17.200
it.

13:17.200 --> 13:22.840
Yeah, like shared goals, almost right is like, we all want to advance whatever we love a

13:22.840 --> 13:23.840
little bit more.

13:23.840 --> 13:28.040
But the reality is, we all kind of love the same thing.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.760
So why shouldn't we?

13:29.760 --> 13:30.760
We know each other.

13:30.760 --> 13:37.440
Yeah, I feel like that's the real gift, right is you're you're helping to expose not only

13:37.440 --> 13:43.000
the individual person that you're chatting with on a regular basis, but also the type

13:43.000 --> 13:49.140
of person like, okay, I might be a certain type of person in our Linux community.

13:49.140 --> 13:55.000
And surely there's other people in this entire world that are similar to me in that way.

13:55.000 --> 13:59.880
And so I think really, the gift is breaking down the unknown.

13:59.880 --> 14:05.400
Maybe that that's what it was like, in the in all these different communities, unless

14:05.400 --> 14:11.240
you have some relationship to the other community, then you got nothing to go on, right?

14:11.240 --> 14:19.200
I feel like with Big Daddy Linux weekly that you're doing, with all those people involved,

14:19.200 --> 14:22.420
it helps bridge those differences.

14:22.420 --> 14:25.000
But then yeah, these spotlights have been really amazing.

14:25.000 --> 14:30.680
Like the spotlight you did with Jill was so much fun with with Jill Brian Reinecker.

14:30.680 --> 14:34.000
And it was like, just this infectious energy.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.840
I know she's like, infectious as it is.

14:36.840 --> 14:43.200
But but even just the the topics you guys dove into, I just I mentioned it on the chat

14:43.200 --> 14:46.140
her and I did, but it was super awesome.

14:46.140 --> 14:51.840
So I really hope you keep doing these chats for a very long time.

14:51.840 --> 14:54.320
It's been super fun to watch them all.

14:54.320 --> 14:58.280
Do you have a little taste of maybe where you see it going?

14:58.280 --> 15:06.440
Well, I don't have a ultimate goal for Linux spotlight except for cataloging and highlighting

15:06.440 --> 15:14.920
the Linux users in the community because there are some people that will never get that chance,

15:14.920 --> 15:16.720
unless something like that happens.

15:16.720 --> 15:25.680
So you know, nobody would maybe hear about this person, unless you make a video on them

15:25.680 --> 15:28.720
or you make a podcast on them.

15:28.720 --> 15:35.520
And Brent, I have seen so many people that don't say a whole lot.

15:35.520 --> 15:40.880
But then when you talk to them individually, they are such awesome people and and the thing

15:40.880 --> 15:46.880
is, sometimes they don't think they are like they don't think they have a lot of anything

15:46.880 --> 15:53.600
to give to the community and they do everybody has something to give to the community.

15:53.600 --> 15:57.800
Everybody has something to offer, they just may not realize it.

15:57.800 --> 16:02.840
And Linux spotlight highlights that fact that those people, regardless of who they are,

16:02.840 --> 16:08.320
if they're a developer for a major operating system, or they're just a regular everyday

16:08.320 --> 16:10.560
user, everybody has something to give.

16:10.560 --> 16:16.980
It feels like to me you bring a really big part of your heart to those conversations

16:16.980 --> 16:21.540
because it feels like there's a whole lot of empathy there of saying that you can learn

16:21.540 --> 16:24.480
something from every single person, right?

16:24.480 --> 16:26.620
If you only give them the chance.

16:26.620 --> 16:32.900
If you give them that opportunity to talk and you give it in a setting that is comfortable,

16:32.900 --> 16:36.800
they will shine and they will show you what they have to offer.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.440
And all I got to do is hit record.

16:38.440 --> 16:42.300
You have it easy.

16:42.300 --> 16:47.600
Is there a conversation that sort of sticks out for you in in that scene?

16:47.600 --> 16:51.900
Now I ask a lot of different questions on Linux spotlight, but I'm most interested in

16:51.900 --> 16:55.640
how people found Linux.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.640
When did you hear about it?

16:57.640 --> 17:01.800
How did you hear about this Linux operating system?

17:01.800 --> 17:05.040
And there are so many different answers.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.360
Nobody has the same story.

17:06.360 --> 17:11.140
It may be similar, but everybody has that little thing about their story that you just

17:11.140 --> 17:14.380
don't get in somebody else's story.

17:14.380 --> 17:20.860
And I won't say that any one conversation has stuck out, but I will say that there are

17:20.860 --> 17:26.580
some regular stories like, Hey, I was working here and some guy mentioned it.

17:26.580 --> 17:33.380
But when you hear people like Jill talk about how she got into Linux and she got into just

17:33.380 --> 17:38.020
developing at an early age, her history was so rich.

17:38.020 --> 17:41.220
It was absolutely fabulous.

17:41.220 --> 17:46.840
I mean that conversation, you just sit there and you know, I'm just sitting there smiling

17:46.840 --> 17:51.840
through the whole conversation because you know, not only is she a awesome person to

17:51.840 --> 17:59.100
talk to because she just has this way about her and her laugh and, but the actual meat

17:59.100 --> 18:01.940
of the conversation, it was fantastic.

18:01.940 --> 18:02.940
Yeah.

18:02.940 --> 18:07.020
Well it, it echoed for me exactly what you just said earlier, which is you get to know

18:07.020 --> 18:10.700
so much more about a person in that context, right?

18:10.700 --> 18:15.180
Like I think you and I knew Jill before we had our conversations with her, but there

18:15.180 --> 18:19.860
was so much I learned about her during your chat with her that I was like, I just know

18:19.860 --> 18:24.500
this person as someone who's really great, who seems to know stuff about Linux and maybe

18:24.500 --> 18:25.760
does a bit of animation.

18:25.760 --> 18:30.340
But then once I listened to your conversation, it's like, Oh wait, she has so much depth.

18:30.340 --> 18:31.340
Yes.

18:31.340 --> 18:37.260
And you're suggesting, and I totally support it that everyone has that same depth, right?

18:37.260 --> 18:40.000
You just have to give it an opportunity to shine.

18:40.000 --> 18:45.060
You have to give them that opportunity, but I would like to go back to something you said

18:45.060 --> 18:49.100
about your, your conversation and our, and my conversation with her.

18:49.100 --> 18:56.540
I think that the two conversations are different and yet the same, and you can learn about

18:56.540 --> 19:01.660
Jill things that you didn't know in Linux spotlight, and you can also learn about Jill

19:01.660 --> 19:07.140
things you didn't know about her in your chat with her on your show.

19:07.140 --> 19:10.340
And there's no way I would miss either one of them.

19:10.340 --> 19:17.340
So I agree completely and I connected with Jill, I think a few weeks before your conversation

19:17.340 --> 19:20.480
and for various reasons, we just didn't get a chance to record.

19:20.480 --> 19:24.440
And so when I saw your conversation come out, I was like, Oh, this is really interesting.

19:24.440 --> 19:27.220
Like I'm going to totally listen to it.

19:27.220 --> 19:31.540
And I was floored by just how much of a fun discussion it was.

19:31.540 --> 19:35.240
And then I thought, I don't want to step on your toes for what you did because you guys

19:35.240 --> 19:40.880
had such a great conversation that was like totally great quality.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.820
So I thought there's no way I want to like redo that.

19:43.820 --> 19:44.900
That doesn't make any sense.

19:44.900 --> 19:49.780
And in the spirit of being community, I thought I'm going to take the great conversation you

19:49.780 --> 19:52.440
guys did and just supplement it.

19:52.440 --> 19:56.580
And then it could be like two communities coming together exactly like you were saying,

19:56.580 --> 19:57.580
right?

19:57.580 --> 20:02.620
And so it was so important to me to mention that discussion of yours right on the outset

20:02.620 --> 20:07.260
so that people had context for where we are going next.

20:07.260 --> 20:12.560
And so I really hope that everyone who listened to the conversation, the brunt that I did

20:12.560 --> 20:17.460
with her took in your discussion too, because there was so much brilliance in there.

20:17.460 --> 20:25.080
And and and it also I will say Rocco, it feels really nice that you and I can complement

20:25.080 --> 20:26.180
each other.

20:26.180 --> 20:31.580
Like I think in some contexts, it could easily be seen as like, Oh, two people trying to

20:31.580 --> 20:34.820
accomplish the same thing, but in a rivalry setting.

20:34.820 --> 20:37.140
And I don't think that's the right approach at all.

20:37.140 --> 20:43.540
I think that that's exactly what we need to break down in the Linux community is this

20:43.540 --> 20:49.460
whole rivalry, whether it be about my desktop environment against your desktop environment

20:49.460 --> 20:51.540
or your community against my community.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.940
We are all one community.

20:53.940 --> 21:03.460
And I, I am so happy listening to your episodes on your show, I never think about, Hey, you're

21:03.460 --> 21:06.620
doing this person and I should be doing this person or you're doing this person.

21:06.620 --> 21:08.060
And well, now I can't.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.180
That's ridiculous.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.620
That is absolutely ridiculous.

21:10.620 --> 21:11.680
It's totally ridiculous.

21:11.680 --> 21:16.380
I'm sure in the future, we're going to do the same thing we're going to do similar people.

21:16.380 --> 21:18.780
That's just because we're in the same communities.

21:18.780 --> 21:24.220
Well, and what's been really interesting is, is that some of the people I've chatted with,

21:24.220 --> 21:30.780
I didn't, I either didn't realize that they've already chatted with you, or that they have

21:30.780 --> 21:33.140
since come and had a chat with you.

21:33.140 --> 21:34.980
And you learn all sorts of new things, right?

21:34.980 --> 21:40.660
Like I think you recently released an episode with with cheese bacon.

21:40.660 --> 21:46.700
And you did a chat with L and those are all some Jupiter broadcasting crew members.

21:46.700 --> 21:51.740
And I've seen so much of your community say like, Oh yeah, these are great people.

21:51.740 --> 21:55.540
And so both of our communities are growing together and it's such an awesome gift.

21:55.540 --> 22:00.560
And it's, it's really cool from my position and from the seat you're sitting in to watch

22:00.560 --> 22:03.080
that happen in real time.

22:03.080 --> 22:07.580
You know, I've, I've got this giant smile on my face because I've just thinking of like,

22:07.580 --> 22:11.700
okay, in six months, where is that energy that you and I are putting into these discussions

22:11.700 --> 22:13.700
going to take us and going to take our community?

22:13.700 --> 22:19.260
It feels like in many ways so cool to have, you know, a partner in a way that's trying

22:19.260 --> 22:20.260
to accomplish the same thing.

22:20.260 --> 22:28.980
So so kudos to you for for bringing that same energy to all of this, it feels like a real

22:28.980 --> 22:32.540
treat to have like, someone who's trying to accomplish the same thing.

22:32.540 --> 22:33.820
So thanks for that.

22:33.820 --> 22:39.380
I think that this is, like I said before, just as much as the gift to me than it is

22:39.380 --> 22:41.980
that it is to the community itself.

22:41.980 --> 22:44.100
I enjoy these conversations so much.

22:44.100 --> 22:45.380
And that's why I do it.

22:45.380 --> 22:48.820
Because I, I do enjoy talking to these people.

22:48.820 --> 22:55.100
And again, some of these people, you, you don't even realize how much they had to offer

22:55.100 --> 22:56.700
until you get to talk to them.

22:56.700 --> 23:06.680
I thought it might be kind of fun to ask you a few questions, Linux spotlight way.

23:06.680 --> 23:10.820
Because sometimes, you know, as as hosts of some of these conversations, you may pick

23:10.820 --> 23:13.140
up a few little nuggets here and there.

23:13.140 --> 23:15.220
So I will bounce one of your questions right back to you.

23:15.220 --> 23:16.220
How did you?

23:16.220 --> 23:21.060
How did you first get into Linux and what grabbed you about it?

23:21.060 --> 23:26.060
There have been people that have asked when my spotlight is going to be and I keep telling

23:26.060 --> 23:31.540
them that after everybody else is done, that will be when you know what I have had the

23:31.540 --> 23:35.020
exact same question repeatedly.

23:35.020 --> 23:41.780
And and I have a twin brother, and so I am often my quick response as well, I'll just

23:41.780 --> 23:42.780
interview my twin brother.

23:42.780 --> 23:45.700
And that'll kind of be the quasi discussion, right?

23:45.700 --> 23:51.640
But there's this humbling quality that I pick up in us like, No, no, I'm not the important

23:51.640 --> 23:52.640
one.

23:52.640 --> 23:53.640
Let's concentrate on the other person.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.340
But I wonder if some people might be interested in that kind of stuff as well to get to know

23:56.340 --> 23:57.340
you a little bit better.

23:57.340 --> 24:01.380
Well, I mean, they may be interested, but there's many other more interesting people

24:01.380 --> 24:02.560
out there than I am.

24:02.560 --> 24:06.460
So but where did I start Linux?

24:06.460 --> 24:12.980
Years ago, I had had many computers, Windows, I was into tweaking it.

24:12.980 --> 24:21.340
I had become an expert at reformatting Windows, because of how many times I messed it up.

24:21.340 --> 24:26.340
I read all kinds of tech magazines and websites and whatnot.

24:26.340 --> 24:34.140
So I ended up trying Ubuntu the first time, and somehow, I don't know exactly how I did

24:34.140 --> 24:37.780
it, but I ended up messing up my Windows partition.

24:37.780 --> 24:38.780
That's easy to do.

24:38.780 --> 24:41.820
That's super easy to do, especially back then.

24:41.820 --> 24:44.380
Yeah, I didn't like it.

24:44.380 --> 24:49.140
So I reported, I put Windows back on, and I just put Linux to the side.

24:49.140 --> 24:56.560
And then later, a few years, goodbye, and then there was the will-be installer.

24:56.560 --> 25:03.620
So that would put Linux aside of your Windows partition, which was perfect for me.

25:03.620 --> 25:10.600
And I tried it, and I booted into the desktop, and it was great, except I had no idea how

25:10.600 --> 25:13.580
to get to my files.

25:13.580 --> 25:19.080
So I would open the file manager, but it wouldn't recognize the drive that I had my files on.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.260
And I was completely unfamiliar with Linux.

25:21.260 --> 25:26.940
So as much as it was exciting, I just decided, you know what?

25:26.940 --> 25:31.140
It's great, but if I can't get to my files and I can't do anything, then it's kind of

25:31.140 --> 25:32.140
not for me.

25:32.140 --> 25:37.940
A few years go down, and then I end up trying it again.

25:37.940 --> 25:39.980
And that time, it worked.

25:39.980 --> 25:45.820
And I don't remember what distribution I started with, to be honest with you.

25:45.820 --> 25:52.740
But I ended up on KDE, and KDE 3.5 days were awesome.

25:52.740 --> 25:56.300
It was like a tweaker's dream to have that.

25:56.300 --> 26:02.160
I mean, you could tweak every single setting possible, and I loved it.

26:02.160 --> 26:08.940
The reason that I created my YouTube channel was because at that time, there was no videos

26:08.940 --> 26:09.940
on KDE.

26:09.940 --> 26:12.060
I mean, there were no tutorials on the settings.

26:12.060 --> 26:18.500
It was like you were in this huge land of settings, and you had no idea what half of

26:18.500 --> 26:19.500
them did.

26:19.500 --> 26:24.340
And I said to myself, you know, I could create a video to tell people about the settings,

26:24.340 --> 26:27.220
but I don't really know all of the settings.

26:27.220 --> 26:30.960
I felt like you needed to know every setting in order to start.

26:30.960 --> 26:36.460
So it was actually my dad who said to me, well, you just tell them what you know.

26:36.460 --> 26:37.460
Wise words.

26:37.460 --> 26:38.460
Okay.

26:38.460 --> 26:43.260
And I just started making videos on customizing KDE.

26:43.260 --> 26:49.120
And if you look at my YouTube channel in the very beginning, it was nothing but KDE customization

26:49.120 --> 26:51.460
tutorials and settings and stuff.

26:51.460 --> 26:55.460
So yeah, that's basically my Linux history in a nutshell.

26:55.460 --> 27:00.220
Yeah, it sounds like you were, with the videos, scratching your own itch in many ways, right?

27:00.220 --> 27:04.700
And sometimes they say that's the best indication of something that you should do is when you

27:04.700 --> 27:06.380
really desire it, but it doesn't exist.

27:06.380 --> 27:10.260
Like, okay, I guess I'll make it.

27:10.260 --> 27:12.300
And look where that's led you now, right?

27:12.300 --> 27:13.300
Yep.

27:13.300 --> 27:18.740
So I had the channel and I was doing, you know, different videos.

27:18.740 --> 27:21.060
I started to do distributed reviews.

27:21.060 --> 27:24.520
It became a headache at some point.

27:24.520 --> 27:25.520
In what way?

27:25.520 --> 27:32.420
In a way of you felt like, or I felt like I needed to keep up with every distribution

27:32.420 --> 27:33.420
that came out.

27:33.420 --> 27:37.380
Like, so every distribution that came out, I needed to do a video on it.

27:37.380 --> 27:41.460
And it was like, that was too much basically.

27:41.460 --> 27:47.260
So I kind of, I don't know, took a break from doing videos as far as distribution videos

27:47.260 --> 27:48.980
were concerned.

27:48.980 --> 27:54.900
And then I met a guy named Rob Collins who had a Linux YouTube channel and he asked me

27:54.900 --> 27:58.940
to come on his show to talk about stuff, talk about Linux.

27:58.940 --> 27:59.940
And I was like, sure.

27:59.940 --> 28:04.060
He had a lot, he just made a live stream and we just started talking, we hit it off.

28:04.060 --> 28:08.740
And then that's when the Destination Linux podcast was born.

28:08.740 --> 28:10.620
And how did he find you?

28:10.620 --> 28:18.060
Well, I was watching his videos and he had a way about him that was, he wouldn't, you

28:18.060 --> 28:21.340
know, dive deep into tutorials.

28:21.340 --> 28:29.140
He wouldn't dive deep into deep technology, but he would give you overviews in a way that

28:29.140 --> 28:32.540
was very friendly and very casual.

28:32.540 --> 28:34.740
And that I enjoyed.

28:34.740 --> 28:40.060
And I just started watching his videos and was on his, he had a live stream the one time

28:40.060 --> 28:45.100
I was in chat and was saying hi to him and talking to him and slowly but surely he said,

28:45.100 --> 28:46.100
Hey, you want to come on?

28:46.100 --> 28:47.100
Sure.

28:47.100 --> 28:50.780
It's funny how that progression is so important, right?

28:50.780 --> 28:57.140
Like I always say the best thing you can do as a community member, if you enjoy a show

28:57.140 --> 29:01.020
like that or something is just show up in some way where you can start making connections,

29:01.020 --> 29:02.020
right?

29:02.020 --> 29:05.820
And sometimes that's just being in an IRC or a chat on YouTube or something like that.

29:05.820 --> 29:10.380
And that's where it starts and you start to get like tastes of that community.

29:10.380 --> 29:16.060
And then you start maybe providing your own perspective and then it grows and grows from

29:16.060 --> 29:17.060
there.

29:17.060 --> 29:20.900
And then, Oh, all of a sudden maybe you get invited to share your perspective with audio

29:20.900 --> 29:21.900
or something like that.

29:21.900 --> 29:22.900
And then it grows and grows.

29:22.900 --> 29:25.580
And I mean, that's how it happened for me.

29:25.580 --> 29:27.860
That's how it happened for you.

29:27.860 --> 29:35.180
And I hear that story so often is somebody shows up for a few weeks in a row and all

29:35.180 --> 29:39.700
of a sudden they get to become friends with people they never expected.

29:39.700 --> 29:43.300
And that leads to all sorts of opportunities that you could never even imagine.

29:43.300 --> 29:44.300
Right?

29:44.300 --> 29:47.860
Well, there are many stories just like what you're talking about.

29:47.860 --> 29:53.660
And then there are the stories of Eric Adams who has his own YouTube channel, helped me

29:53.660 --> 30:01.780
out with the Biddle community, making a website, a proper website and a discourse forums.

30:01.780 --> 30:08.300
And from this discourse forums, you see people join and they say, yeah, I've been watching

30:08.300 --> 30:11.020
Biddle for a year and a half.

30:11.020 --> 30:13.180
I just figured I'd say hi.

30:13.180 --> 30:16.380
Never heard of that person, never saw their name come up.

30:16.380 --> 30:18.700
And that is awesome to me.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.340
That's the people I want to talk to.

30:20.340 --> 30:24.620
That's the people, you know, the people that are just watching in the background, not even

30:24.620 --> 30:31.100
involved in the YouTube chat, but they're there and they have a story to tell too.

30:31.100 --> 30:36.380
I love hearing and seeing those posts come in when they're like, yeah, this is my first

30:36.380 --> 30:37.740
time I've been watching for a long time.

30:37.740 --> 30:39.900
I've been trolling or, you know, in the background.

30:39.900 --> 30:43.580
Well, cause we can empathize because that was us at one point.

30:43.580 --> 30:44.580
Right?

30:44.580 --> 30:45.580
Yep.

30:45.580 --> 30:51.580
So how do you take that initial hello and make it blossom in some way?

30:51.580 --> 30:54.900
That's exactly how Biddle started.

30:54.900 --> 30:58.580
I just decided one day I was just going to do a live stream and I was going to check

30:58.580 --> 31:03.020
out a distribution and I called it Friday Night Live.

31:03.020 --> 31:04.980
I just pulled up a distribution.

31:04.980 --> 31:08.940
I don't even remember which one it was and there were these people that showed up and

31:08.940 --> 31:13.300
eventually I said, Hey, you know, do you want to come on and talk?

31:13.300 --> 31:16.100
And two or three people joined that night.

31:16.100 --> 31:20.220
And from there it just started, well, why don't we do it again next week?

31:20.220 --> 31:25.100
And from there, there were many iterations of, I switched times trying to find the perfect

31:25.100 --> 31:27.660
time, which there is no perfect time for everybody.

31:27.660 --> 31:28.660
It's so true.

31:28.660 --> 31:29.660
Right.

31:29.660 --> 31:31.100
Especially when you start to reach globally.

31:31.100 --> 31:32.380
I hate time zones, dude.

31:32.380 --> 31:33.380
I hate them.

31:33.380 --> 31:36.880
Blame the sun.

31:36.880 --> 31:42.180
But uh, you know, it went from Friday Night Live and then it turned into what it is today,

31:42.180 --> 31:46.460
which is Big Daddy Linux Live, which we don't really, that's too long of a name to call

31:46.460 --> 31:47.460
it.

31:47.460 --> 31:50.460
So we just call it Biddle.

31:50.460 --> 31:53.300
And it's of course going to continue evolving, right?

31:53.300 --> 31:55.340
That's just kind of the nature of it.

31:55.340 --> 31:57.740
We will change things from time to time.

31:57.740 --> 32:00.700
Like, uh, we didn't always have a district challenge.

32:00.700 --> 32:05.780
It was just, we would get on for two hours and talk, but it just was a kind of a natural

32:05.780 --> 32:10.460
progression to change with that to say, you know, well, you know, we were all talking

32:10.460 --> 32:13.820
about trying the new, say, Ubuntu that came out.

32:13.820 --> 32:17.300
Well, why don't we all try it and talk about it?

32:17.300 --> 32:20.020
And that's how that ended up coming about.

32:20.020 --> 32:25.180
And um, there are times where we'll do a two week challenge, uh, but we've been doing one

32:25.180 --> 32:30.940
week challenges lately because when you try the Ubuntus and we want to try them, but when

32:30.940 --> 32:34.980
they release every six months and you got six or eight to try, you can't do a two week

32:34.980 --> 32:38.820
challenge or you'd be doing nothing but them.

32:38.820 --> 32:44.300
So, uh, so for that, like right now we're at a one week challenge for each Ubuntu flavor

32:44.300 --> 32:49.020
and then we'll, after that's done, we'll continue on with community suggestions for distros

32:49.020 --> 32:50.020
and everything.

32:50.020 --> 32:54.460
Well, and what's so cool about that is that you're getting perspectives from a whole bunch

32:54.460 --> 32:59.020
of different types of users just from the nature of that, of the people that show up,

32:59.020 --> 33:00.020
right?

33:00.020 --> 33:02.140
And I don't know if you can get that anywhere else.

33:02.140 --> 33:07.700
I think one thing about it is that I, what I don't want people to think is that you have

33:07.700 --> 33:12.300
to try the distro challenge in order to join a lot.

33:12.300 --> 33:15.760
I get that a lot where why didn't try the distro challenge for I'm not joining this

33:15.760 --> 33:20.340
week or I'm, I, you know, if it's somebody new, why didn't try it?

33:20.340 --> 33:22.020
That's not a necessity.

33:22.020 --> 33:25.060
If you want to, you can, and if you don't, that's great.

33:25.060 --> 33:28.500
If anybody's listening and they want to join, they don't have to do the distro challenge.

33:28.500 --> 33:29.500
That's an important nugget, right?

33:29.500 --> 33:34.480
It's like, even if you join and say nothing, you're still there and that presence is felt.

33:34.480 --> 33:41.260
And we have people that join, uh, there's a guy on there, Paul, and he comes in and

33:41.260 --> 33:43.460
he rarely says anything.

33:43.460 --> 33:48.900
He loves being there and he'll throw in one thing here or one thing there at the very

33:48.900 --> 33:52.300
end, but he continually comes every week and I love it.

33:52.300 --> 33:53.300
Yeah.

33:53.300 --> 33:57.460
You know, that reminds me a lot of, of Linux unplugged that we do with Jupiter broadcasting,

33:57.460 --> 33:58.460
which is audio only.

33:58.460 --> 34:00.180
Um, but it's very similar.

34:00.180 --> 34:05.740
Like we do a mumble room and, and anybody can join and lots of people just show up and

34:05.740 --> 34:10.460
you don't necessarily hear from them unless you're, you know, before the show or after

34:10.460 --> 34:11.700
the show.

34:11.700 --> 34:17.180
And yet it's still so nice to see those familiar, well, I was going to say familiar faces, but

34:17.180 --> 34:22.300
to see those familiar usernames or whatever it might be, um, just being there, right?

34:22.300 --> 34:25.220
It feels like we're all in the same room, which is such a nice thing.

34:25.220 --> 34:26.220
Yep.

34:26.220 --> 34:28.500
Everybody, again, everybody has something to give.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.900
And just being there is giving something.

34:30.900 --> 34:31.900
Yeah.

34:31.900 --> 34:36.540
It's giving like a vote of confidence that what's happening here is important, right?

34:36.540 --> 34:37.540
Yep.

34:37.540 --> 34:44.440
I wanted to ask you a little bit more about, um, you were, you were explaining how maybe

34:44.440 --> 34:49.020
it'd be kind of fun to have me on Linux spotlight as well, right?

34:49.020 --> 34:50.020
Yes.

34:50.020 --> 34:54.820
You know, I think in the same way as you just described when I asked you about your beginnings

34:54.820 --> 34:58.300
with Linux, I'm like fidgeting in my chair because it makes me uncomfortable in a strange

34:58.300 --> 35:05.260
kind of way to have that, to have that, well, the spotlight turned, turned the other direction,

35:05.260 --> 35:06.260
right?

35:06.260 --> 35:12.940
And so it's such an interesting thing to me is that we can be on the microphone regularly

35:12.940 --> 35:17.900
and yet all of a sudden when it's turned in a different light, it, it, it changes things.

35:17.900 --> 35:22.580
Changes things completely for me because a lot of times I won't even know what to say

35:22.580 --> 35:28.020
sometimes, you know, it's like you get asked questions like maybe you forget or, you know,

35:28.020 --> 35:29.200
and maybe that's with my age.

35:29.200 --> 35:30.200
I don't know.

35:30.200 --> 35:31.200
But

35:31.200 --> 35:35.280
well, I think there's a certain like performance that's happening, right?

35:35.280 --> 35:38.100
And so there's all the regular stuff like performance anxieties.

35:38.100 --> 35:44.220
I mean, if anybody's ever stood on a stage and tried to give a talk, it's, it's not dissimilar.

35:44.220 --> 35:51.660
Uh, it may happen through the internet most of the time, but there's, there's all this

35:51.660 --> 35:56.060
emotional stuff that comes with it, which you can't ignore and your body reacts in ways,

35:56.060 --> 35:57.060
right?

35:57.060 --> 36:00.060
It reacts in ways you don't want it to, yes.

36:00.060 --> 36:05.180
That you sometimes can't predict.

36:05.180 --> 36:10.100
Tell me about like some of the favorite questions that you get to ask people that, that you're

36:10.100 --> 36:11.460
getting to know.

36:11.460 --> 36:17.740
Well, like I said before, I really enjoy hearing about the history, but there's one particular

36:17.740 --> 36:24.820
question that I, I get to ask and it's one of those questions where you think, ah, here

36:24.820 --> 36:25.820
we go.

36:25.820 --> 36:32.140
But it's so interesting to see the different answers and how people think about it differently.

36:32.140 --> 36:39.300
So one of the questions that I get to ask is, um, what do you think of when I ask you

36:39.300 --> 36:42.500
about the year of the Linux desktop?

36:42.500 --> 36:47.180
And that brings on so many different opinions about what it is.

36:47.180 --> 36:54.060
Some people think it's like a serious question of how we get to a point where Linux is king

36:54.060 --> 36:55.660
on the desktop.

36:55.660 --> 37:01.900
Some people approach it like, uh, the year of the Linux desktop, my favorite answer was

37:01.900 --> 37:09.540
from cubicle Nate and he said, the year of the Linux desktop is the year that you found

37:09.540 --> 37:10.540
Linux.

37:10.540 --> 37:13.260
Oh, that is lovely.

37:13.260 --> 37:15.580
It was absolutely awesome.

37:15.580 --> 37:19.020
And I loved it because, you know, like I said, there are people who will, and there's nothing

37:19.020 --> 37:25.020
wrong with approaching it from a normal standpoint of a thought, but it, he was thinking so out

37:25.020 --> 37:29.780
of the box and I, and that is exactly my answer.

37:29.780 --> 37:33.460
The year of the Linux desktop is the year that you found Linux and you were introduced

37:33.460 --> 37:41.020
to it and you had that feeling in you that you were so excited to try this distribution

37:41.020 --> 37:45.640
out or try this operating system out that you were just like dancing.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.240
I remember doing that.

37:47.240 --> 37:50.700
And it seems like everybody else has that same experience.

37:50.700 --> 37:54.340
At one point in time, they were super excited to try it out.

37:54.340 --> 37:56.660
Yeah, that was the best answer ever.

37:56.660 --> 38:01.820
I love the insight into that because, um, it's so true.

38:01.820 --> 38:06.620
That's the thing that connects all of us is when it came into our lives and it grabbed

38:06.620 --> 38:08.500
us and never let go.

38:08.500 --> 38:12.180
And for you, that took a few goes at it.

38:12.180 --> 38:14.020
And that story is not dissimilar to mine.

38:14.020 --> 38:17.580
It's like investigating it and it's, oh, it's not quite the right time.

38:17.580 --> 38:22.140
And then checking it out a few years later and, and, and diving in maybe a little deeper,

38:22.140 --> 38:23.140
right?

38:23.140 --> 38:26.580
But then eventually it just grabs hold and it doesn't let go.

38:26.580 --> 38:31.380
When I was messing around with KDE in the very beginning, that is exactly the feeling

38:31.380 --> 38:32.440
I had.

38:32.440 --> 38:38.600
You had this sense of freedom that you never had with windows and you could just change

38:38.600 --> 38:39.600
anything.

38:39.600 --> 38:40.600
Wow.

38:40.600 --> 38:46.220
And there were programs on windows that you could buy to change things like window blinds

38:46.220 --> 38:50.180
was a program years ago that you could buy to change windows around.

38:50.180 --> 38:56.600
I never bought it, um, but, but when you're trying Linux and you're in, in this setting

38:56.600 --> 39:02.500
land of settings of KDE and you have, and you can just change everything, it is such

39:02.500 --> 39:05.980
an amazing feeling to be alive.

39:05.980 --> 39:06.980
That's all I can say.

39:06.980 --> 39:07.980
Yeah.

39:07.980 --> 39:13.720
You mentioned the word freedom and you know, that has of course a bunch of connotations,

39:13.720 --> 39:19.180
but to have that feeling of freedom when you're using, you know, what some people could see

39:19.180 --> 39:21.820
as just a tool to get work done.

39:21.820 --> 39:26.700
But there's this amazing thing that happens when you start admiring the tool and what

39:26.700 --> 39:28.740
it gives you in return, right?

39:28.740 --> 39:32.540
It's kind of like this symbiotic relationship that happens.

39:32.540 --> 39:39.100
You know, I imagine everyone listening has had that experience of being so jazzed about

39:39.100 --> 39:44.620
the tool that's in your hands, uh, that you just kind of get giddy.

39:44.620 --> 39:45.620
Yep.

39:45.620 --> 39:54.100
Well, I just recently tried, uh, Kubuntu for the Distro challenge and I boot into this

39:54.100 --> 40:00.800
and it was like all of these memories flash back in your head of trying KDE and I was

40:00.800 --> 40:04.780
honestly like a kid in the candy store, just, oh my gosh, I can do this again.

40:04.780 --> 40:06.380
Oh my gosh, I can do this again.

40:06.380 --> 40:09.340
I can switch this around certain other operating systems.

40:09.340 --> 40:13.740
You can switch or certain other districts, you can switch things around, but you can't

40:13.740 --> 40:19.780
as easily or maybe you can't do it to the extent you can do it with KDE.

40:19.780 --> 40:26.780
And again, I was just that kid in the candy store checking everything out and you know,

40:26.780 --> 40:31.260
I don't know if you have hopped around on distros, but I hopped.

40:31.260 --> 40:35.260
Certainly have done some hopping.

40:35.260 --> 40:42.660
I have hopped for, well, since I started Linux and recently I've got to the point where I

40:42.660 --> 40:47.580
own a main stable machine in which I run Pop OS and that's my main stable machine and that

40:47.580 --> 40:50.300
hasn't changed and probably won't change.

40:50.300 --> 40:55.180
But in trying these distros, you get that, I don't know, that feeling inside of trying

40:55.180 --> 40:58.300
that excitement of trying a new distro out.

40:58.300 --> 41:01.300
It's almost like Christmas every time you decide to do that, right?

41:01.300 --> 41:02.300
Yeah.

41:02.300 --> 41:10.520
It's an amazing thing that we get to do that on the backs of everybody in the development

41:10.520 --> 41:14.420
community that has put their hard work and effort in it.

41:14.420 --> 41:21.980
They don't get near enough credit for all of the time and you know, time is like the

41:21.980 --> 41:30.140
most valuable thing we have and they give it freely to everybody to try.

41:30.140 --> 41:36.620
And that's why I tell people when we try distribution, I want you to be honest with your take on

41:36.620 --> 41:37.620
the distribution.

41:37.620 --> 41:38.900
If it's not for you, you say it's not for you.

41:38.900 --> 41:43.620
If these things went wrong, you say they went, I want it to be honest, but I also don't want

41:43.620 --> 41:50.260
to go in and trash a distro because you didn't like this particular aspect of it.

41:50.260 --> 41:55.100
It has to be constructive criticism because there is so much effort put into this, so

41:55.100 --> 41:59.980
much work behind the scenes that people, they realize it, but they don't realize it.

41:59.980 --> 42:04.380
They would only realize it if they had, if they were to put that amount of time and effort

42:04.380 --> 42:11.440
into it and I am just grateful to all of the developers that give us this opportunity to

42:11.440 --> 42:17.020
just to do it and I get that excitement out of it and it's awesome.

42:17.020 --> 42:19.860
Yeah, it's such a huge gift to all of us, right?

42:19.860 --> 42:26.300
And I feel like you even saying those words of like, thank you is even just a small way

42:26.300 --> 42:32.500
of giving back in a way it's like, yes, we so appreciate the work that you're doing.

42:32.500 --> 42:37.300
Please continue to do it and we'll support you in any way we can.

42:37.300 --> 42:44.380
That's super huge and I have felt one thing I've kind of come to learn is that distributions

42:44.380 --> 42:52.400
and software and all of that is, you can almost see it as they have personalities and a piece

42:52.400 --> 42:57.620
of software or a distribution or something like that may not fit for you.

42:57.620 --> 43:02.940
That doesn't necessarily mean that it's not really valuable because it may really fit

43:02.940 --> 43:05.220
for someone else, right?

43:05.220 --> 43:10.780
And bringing that perspective to the conversation feels like a really inclusive way to do it

43:10.780 --> 43:12.980
and less sort of black and white.

43:12.980 --> 43:15.260
This one's good, this one isn't, right?

43:15.260 --> 43:19.060
That's what we need to continue doing is like, oh, these features in this distribution over

43:19.060 --> 43:24.680
here, like you were mentioning, KDE is really customizable and that's for me and maybe this

43:24.680 --> 43:29.180
other one over here is a little bit more simplistic, but that's gonna be for somebody else, right?

43:29.180 --> 43:35.180
I have seen so many, and not just me, I'm sure you have too, but over the years, so

43:35.180 --> 43:42.580
many people behind the scenes, developers and whatnot have walked away from being burnout,

43:42.580 --> 43:47.740
from taking heat from the community, for not doing it the way they wanted it done.

43:47.740 --> 43:54.260
And I think it's just a total shame that it has to be that way, that we need to be behind

43:54.260 --> 44:00.860
the developers that are here, because again, their time is valuable, it's just as valuable

44:00.860 --> 44:04.220
as your time, and it's just as valuable as my time.

44:04.220 --> 44:06.500
Arguably perhaps more valuable.

44:06.500 --> 44:07.500
Arguably more valuable, right.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.940
Because of the number of users who benefit, you know?

44:09.940 --> 44:15.580
I would like to say, and I don't know how to say that, but I would like to say thank

44:15.580 --> 44:18.100
you to each and every developer out there.

44:18.100 --> 44:23.080
Yeah, you know, I guess in some ways you are, because you're also giving to the community

44:23.080 --> 44:28.660
in some way, and so you're not maybe giving directly to them, but if we can all give a

44:28.660 --> 44:35.580
little piece of us to make this entire environment a little bit better, then maybe we all win.

44:35.580 --> 44:37.340
Everybody has something to give.

44:37.340 --> 44:38.340
Everybody.

44:38.340 --> 44:39.340
Yeah.

44:39.340 --> 44:42.780
You've said that repeatedly in this conversation, and I think it's worth repeating, right?

44:42.780 --> 44:46.460
It's like, every single person has something, so if you're someone who doesn't believe

44:46.460 --> 44:51.220
that you do, come chat with us, we'll find a way.

44:51.220 --> 44:53.740
Yep.

44:53.740 --> 44:58.020
Is there like maybe an ask of the community that you would like to put out there?

44:58.020 --> 45:01.720
And I feel like maybe there's been nuggets of that in our discussion, but something you'd

45:01.720 --> 45:07.940
like them to try or go check out or do or participate in, something like that?

45:07.940 --> 45:17.540
I would like everybody who's listening to somehow in some way thank a developer for

45:17.540 --> 45:19.620
what they do.

45:19.620 --> 45:22.500
It doesn't matter if it's a simple thank you.

45:22.500 --> 45:27.580
It doesn't matter if it's an email to somebody.

45:27.580 --> 45:33.100
Any way that you can donate, and I don't mean monetarily, that's fine, but any way

45:33.100 --> 45:39.880
you can donate to the community is going to benefit every single one of us.

45:39.880 --> 45:45.520
It takes each and every one of us to make this community, and you may be that person

45:45.520 --> 45:54.300
that is in conversation and upfront with everything, like say on Biddle, again, we have many people.

45:54.300 --> 45:57.620
Some people talk a lot, some people talk a little, and some people don't talk much

45:57.620 --> 45:58.800
at all.

45:58.800 --> 46:03.200
Each and every one of you can give back to the community in your own way.

46:03.200 --> 46:08.260
You don't have to have a specific talent in something, you don't have to have a lot

46:08.260 --> 46:09.260
of money.

46:09.260 --> 46:16.020
You can just find a way to give back, and that can be as simple as a thank you.

46:16.020 --> 46:22.100
It's amazing what a simple thank you can do for someone's energy.

46:22.100 --> 46:27.700
I would say Twitter is a fabulous way to connect with people really quickly to say, yeah, I

46:27.700 --> 46:29.740
value what you're doing.

46:29.740 --> 46:36.860
It's akin to receiving a postcard or something from someone.

46:36.860 --> 46:41.820
It's very simple, and yet it carries this weight that is amazing.

46:41.820 --> 46:48.620
Well, you get to a point where you get, say you're a developer and you're doing all

46:48.620 --> 46:55.380
of this for the community, and you hear all of this feedback.

46:55.380 --> 47:01.500
At some point, it has to be frustrating when you put your heart and soul into everything

47:01.500 --> 47:07.740
that you do, and yet sometimes it seems like it's not good enough.

47:07.740 --> 47:08.740
Let's just take a distro.

47:08.740 --> 47:14.500
There are so many people that try out a distro, and most of the time, the ones you hear are

47:14.500 --> 47:15.980
the negative ones.

47:15.980 --> 47:21.880
The ones that like it and the ones that it just works for, they don't really say anything.

47:21.880 --> 47:24.180
You may not even hear from them at all.

47:24.180 --> 47:29.420
And that's what I'm asking people to do is, if you like something, say it.

47:29.420 --> 47:32.620
Say that you like it to whoever it needs to go to.

47:32.620 --> 47:35.220
Yeah, that feels super powerful.

47:35.220 --> 47:40.340
It almost feels like we should do that every single time something like a distribution

47:40.340 --> 47:46.220
comes out with a new version, because as you know, the amount of people's creativity that

47:46.220 --> 47:51.860
goes into a single release of anything is almost unfathomable.

47:51.860 --> 47:56.460
Unless you're behind the scenes and see how much work that goes into it, you really don't

47:56.460 --> 48:04.020
realize how much work and testing and time and retesting and time goes into every single

48:04.020 --> 48:05.540
release that comes out.

48:05.540 --> 48:11.940
And that's whether it's a distro or a program, or it may be down to a simple script.

48:11.940 --> 48:17.640
There's a lot of time involved in this stuff, and we benefit from it, so we should be able

48:17.640 --> 48:18.640
to say thank you.

48:18.640 --> 48:23.020
Well, Rocco, I'm going to say thank you to you for all of the efforts you're putting

48:23.020 --> 48:25.220
into everything that you do.

48:25.220 --> 48:31.220
I feel like the community really values it, and I hope that energy stays high for you.

48:31.220 --> 48:32.220
Appreciate that, man.

48:32.220 --> 48:33.220
We're right there behind you, right?

48:33.220 --> 48:34.220
Keep it going.

48:34.220 --> 48:35.900
Yeah, and you're doing the same thing.

48:35.900 --> 48:36.900
So there you go.

48:36.900 --> 48:37.900
Well, thank you.

48:37.900 --> 48:42.100
And I think that's the beauty of it is that it's reciprocal, and everybody wins, right?

48:42.100 --> 48:45.300
If you boost someone up, you're not taking the energy away from someone else.

48:45.300 --> 48:49.860
You're just raising them, and they might raise you in turn, and everybody gets raised up.

48:49.860 --> 48:52.480
So I think we can keep doing that.

48:52.480 --> 48:55.540
We can be a better community when we continually do that.

48:55.540 --> 48:58.100
Well, Rocco, thank you so much for chatting with me.

48:58.100 --> 48:59.460
It's been a pleasure.

48:59.460 --> 49:00.460
Thanks for having me, Brent.

49:00.460 --> 49:01.460
Of course.

49:01.460 --> 49:22.980
Thank you so much for having me.
