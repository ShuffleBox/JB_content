1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,760
Tim, thanks for joining me on season two of Brunch with Brent, really appreciate having

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,760
you.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,760
Well, thanks.

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,760
It's great to be here.

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,560
Tim, for those who don't know, you joined us early last year on Linux Unplugged.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,440
Could you give us a little bit of an introduction of who you are and what you do?

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:35,760
Well, I am a software engineer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California.

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,640
And for those who might not know, you have NASA as a whole, but then there are centers

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,840
around the country that have various responsibilities.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,840
And the Jet Propulsion Lab, their responsibility has always been robotic spacecraft.

11
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,200
We don't have a pilot, we don't do man launches.

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,720
So all these spacecraft you've read about over the years like Voyager and Cassini and

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:03,200
the Mars rovers, those were all built and launched and operated by the Jet Propulsion

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Lab.

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,880
And so I started there in 1991 coming out of school and I've been there ever since except

16
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,760
for one brief trip out to industry in the mid-90s, but I've been back and doing that

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,620
ever since.

18
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:22,260
And my background is I'm an electrical engineer, but during my studies, I also studied computer

19
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,080
architectures and software.

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:33,040
So much of my career spent living and straddling that world between software and hardware.

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,360
And so over the years, I've worked on a number of projects at JPL.

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,120
When I first came out of school, I worked in their deep space network.

23
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:45,160
For those who may not be familiar, JPL has three sites around the globe so that as the

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:50,800
globe rotates, all these deep space spacecraft can be in view of the earth.

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,880
So there are these gigantic antennas, one of them is 70 meters across.

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,940
If you can imagine an antenna that's most of the width of a football field wide.

27
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,880
So early in my career, I worked writing software to operate those systems.

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,360
And then as my career went on, I switched to the flight side, worked on Cassini for

29
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,680
a while, worked on the Curiosity rover, the one that's been on the surface for 10 years

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
now.

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,240
Much of that software was brought forward to the Perseverance rover, so I have software

32
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,280
running on that rover as well.

33
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,920
But obviously, in the last five years or so, I've been working on the Mars helicopter,

34
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:33,920
which is a small, semi-autonomous helicopter that is a companion to the Perseverance rover.

35
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,960
And so we operate the helicopter via the rover, and it does flights around in the vicinity

36
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,900
of the rover doing scouting, taking pictures, getting a lot of great flight data.

37
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,680
And so that project launched with the rover last year.

38
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,080
We landed in February, so we're almost coming up on a year of the rover being on the surface.

39
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,580
And then during April, we did a series of primary flights to prove the concept of flying

40
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,580
on Mars.

41
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:01,120
And then they went so well, and we got so many awesome pictures that they decided to

42
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,760
extend our mission.

43
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,800
So we've been doing an extended mission of flying around and doing scouting for the rover

44
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,840
ever since.

45
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:15,000
So as of January 14th, the helicopter is still operational, and we're doing a series of repositioning

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,760
flights back to the north to kind of meet the rover as it traverses around some of the

47
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,240
features on the surface of Mars.

48
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,400
So that's my background.

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,720
I was asked to be the software lead, so I led a team of four to five developers to write

50
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,320
the software and the operations tools, meaning the software used once the helicopter is on

51
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:42,720
Mars, it downlinks a bunch of data, and our team wrote tools to digest that data and do

52
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,280
analysis on that data and so on.

53
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,080
And so I transitioned from the flight software lead to the operations lead.

54
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,000
And I still carry on that role to some extent now.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,600
We've gotten in somewhat a routine that I turned over much of the daily operations to

56
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,760
another very enthusiastic young engineer, and I'm actually consulting on some other

57
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,420
projects at JPL now as well that look to taking advantage of what we learned in helicopter

58
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,560
and putting it forward into future projects.

59
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,360
Oh, that sounds fun.

60
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,320
I was going to say, after a year of the successives you've had, I was going to be curious about

61
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,840
what you're doing now, but it sounds like you've handed that day to day torch over to

62
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:24,360
someone who's equally as excited about it.

63
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:31,080
And the things you're working on now, I suppose, is kind of keeping you interested and maybe

64
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:36,740
even bringing some of your expertise and innovating in new areas, which is keeping you probably

65
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,600
pretty excited about what you're working on, I would imagine.

66
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:46,280
Yes, very much so, because JPL and NASA are in some way starting to reexamine how they

67
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,400
deploy hardware because of projects like helicopter.

68
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:56,320
We used a lot of commercial hardware where a typical NASA project will use very, very,

69
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,280
very reliable, but very, very old processing hardware to do their software.

70
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,040
For instance, the rover itself has a processor that was essentially designed in the mid-90s.

71
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
But stable, right?

72
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,200
So yeah, but it's designed from the ground up to be radiation tolerant and have wide

73
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:20,000
thermal ranges, but it's also large and heavy and consumes a lot of power and the compute

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,640
power compared to the helicopter.

75
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:26,040
For instance, our helicopter, the main processor that we have in the helicopter is about 120

76
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,960
times more powerful than the processor on the rover.

77
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,460
And it's in a tiny, compact little size, about the size of one of those mini matchboxes,

78
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,680
if you remember those.

79
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,400
It's not very large at all, but it's enormously powerful for its size.

80
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,040
And so because that miniaturization gives you a lot of power, NASA is taking a longer

81
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,260
look at those and saying, well, how can we take this newer technology and wrap it in

82
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,320
kind of proven ways of fabrication that make it more resistant to the kind of hazards you

83
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,340
have in space, like radiation and the thermal variations that I mentioned?

84
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,520
Because just in space, because there's no atmosphere to mitigate the temperatures, just

85
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,800
a rotating spacecraft can swing through 100 degrees in temperature from one side to the

86
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,800
other.

87
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,560
So you get thermal cycling where things expand and contract and you have to design hardware

88
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,780
so it just doesn't fall apart from the expansion and contraction.

89
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,720
So there's a whole field of how you build this hardware to make it more durable for

90
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
space.

91
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,200
So what we're looking at is things like, can we combine these two where we have these methods

92
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,680
of building that are very robust, but then also take advantage of these powerful processors

93
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,480
that industry is producing?

94
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,780
Yeah, because it sounds like in many ways, the processor that you've thrown on the helicopter

95
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,640
has kind of outdone itself in some ways, and not only the processor, but the entire system.

96
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,940
So I wonder if that's informing some of the deep battle tested nature of some of the,

97
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,480
you know, bigger, older hardware that you're using.

98
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:57,440
So simply by being there for such a long time, you know, it's almost been a year now, that

99
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,400
that's probably informing a lot of future decisions, I would imagine.

100
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Yeah, sure.

101
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,640
And it's I think it's making them look at it a lot more closely, because they see the

102
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,520
advantages of the kind of sheer processing power you can get from these offers.

103
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,080
But you know, we also don't want to throw out all of our experience that we've gained

104
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,200
through years and years of hard lessons in building this really robust hardware.

105
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,240
We don't want to just say, oh, we'll just do everything like helicopter, just buy it

106
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,080
off of a catalog and throw it on there, you know.

107
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,400
It's just a cell phone, right?

108
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,160
And so we want to try to walk this middle ground where we say, okay, let's take advantage

109
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,320
of our experience, but also open up possibilities for incorporating this new technology.

110
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,400
You know, it really reminds me of I don't know if you've heard or listened to it, but

111
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,880
I really got into BBC's 13 minutes to the moon podcast where they explore the Apollo

112
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,560
11 and Apollo 13 missions.

113
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,000
And it really, you know, diving into some of the conversations that you shared on Linux

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,160
Unplugged, where you kind of do a deep dive on the technology that has enabled all of

115
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
this.

116
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:11,040
It reminded me of how crazy the technology was back then when, you know, the moon landings

117
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,040
happened.

118
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,680
Because one of the episodes they go into detail about the computer that made all of the guidance

119
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,840
possible.

120
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,720
And when you compare what that computer is like compared to today's standards, it seems

121
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
absolutely ridiculous.

122
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,680
But at the same time, what they were able to accomplish with those kind of computers

123
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,640
with very, very dedicated instructions to those computers is kind of amazing.

124
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,560
And it sounds like you're kind of carrying that on, but just with completely new technologies.

125
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,920
Yeah, and I think the term disruptor might be overused a bit, but even the notion of

126
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:51,200
putting a computer on a spacecraft and trusting it to humans back in the Apollo days was considered

127
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,960
like a major paradigm shift.

128
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,360
Because back then, the thing that people trusted was analog circuitry and mechanical systems

129
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,720
because it was much more tangible.

130
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,160
We're going to put this thing called the computer on a spacecraft and let it do the guidance

131
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
instead of the pilots.

132
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,600
So you can imagine the people's reaction to that at the time.

133
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,080
So they had to push through those barriers even to put computers on.

134
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,920
And you know, so you see these similar kind of paradigm shifts going on where, you know,

135
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,200
more and more in the modern space field, much more is going into software.

136
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,140
You know, the hardware is becoming more and more of a shell to contain the software because

137
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,680
people are starting to see the advantages of putting more and more intelligence in the

138
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,300
software and the fact that if you get it wrong, you know, assuming it doesn't kill your mission,

139
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,040
there's always a chance of updating it.

140
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,080
Whereas if you have very complicated hardware that you see some problem develop that you

141
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,960
can't fix, you're kind of stuck.

142
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,760
And Mars or another planet is no place to be stuck, is it?

143
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,240
No, especially when you invested the kind of money and time into developing these projects

144
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,160
to say, well, there's a hardware problem we can't fix.

145
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
We're done.

146
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Sorry.

147
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,680
You know, that that is just something that people don't want to have to face down.

148
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,320
Not acceptable, is it?

149
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
Yes.

150
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,120
And it sounds like you were in part, let's say in part, but you can you can accept the

151
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,580
whole thing if you like, in part responsible for some of the Linux adoption that went into,

152
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:19,380
you know, I think this was a deep project where you it's kind of experimental.

153
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:25,400
And you were telling me earlier how Linux was a natural progression from things like

154
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,040
Solaris back in the day.

155
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,960
How was that transition for you from one to the other?

156
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,440
And why was Linux interesting to you back then?

157
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,120
And why is it interesting to you again today?

158
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:43,480
Well, coming from the Linux angle, about 15 years ago, when we were when JPL was very

159
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:50,720
much a Solaris house was, I saw kind of the democratization of the platform as a good

160
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,080
thing.

161
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,000
Because with Solaris, you know, it was this big corporate package, and you bought their

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
hardware with it.

163
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,760
And it was very much a silo, bought the hardware with the software with the services all together.

164
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,600
And they were also extremely expensive to rewind like the internal clock.

165
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:14,420
You know, back in the 2002 2003 era, you know, one of the one of the standard sun workstations

166
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:19,280
was anywhere between 15 and $20,000 a pop, they're very expensive.

167
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,840
Back then, that was actually even more money than we think about these days, right?

168
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
Exactly.

169
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,920
And as I mentioned, and I think it was this podcast, you know, our previous the Linux

170
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,440
unplugged one was I discovered Linux, and I put together a system out of basic parts

171
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,880
you can buy from Fry's electronics, may it rest in peace, you know,

172
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,400
I was thinking you were gonna say Radio Shack.

173
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,580
But I put together a PC for a couple grand at work and ran Linux on it.

174
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:53,720
And it compiled our code at the time twice as fast as the sun machine did that cost seven

175
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,620
to eight times more.

176
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,400
But I'm surprised that that experiment hadn't been done before, in a sense, like that the

177
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,840
Solaris guys weren't like, Oh, we kind of really keep track of what else is out there.

178
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,560
And and so what was the incentive for you to even give that a try?

179
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,160
Well, I was trying to, you know, I saw some of these tool environments that I kind of

180
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,280
like that were in Linux, you know, build build environments and things like that, and compilers

181
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:23,980
and and I saw it as a way to take advantage of them.

182
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,880
And also, just trying to be a good, if you will, a good steward of JPLs money, right,

183
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,140
if we could have a project where we could sometimes the developers would have to share

184
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,600
machines because they were just so expensive.

185
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,680
And you know, the idea that you could, you could have more machines that were more powerful

186
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:48,560
and more people's desks, just kind of was a multiplier of people's efficiency and a

187
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,520
better use of JPLs money.

188
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,360
And so I that's why I started looking into it for my project.

189
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,160
And we essentially turned on a dime at that point.

190
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,560
And we would switch from Solaris to Linux.

191
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,880
And then when I was hired on to do Curiosity, the rover project, they were still using or

192
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,000
were planning and using sun boxes from the previous project.

193
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,560
And I just said, well, let's try this, you know, let's switch and use these Linux machines

194
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,560
instead because they're much more powerful and they're cheaper.

195
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,640
So we can buy more of them and for more developers.

196
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,640
And you know, they were skeptical at first, but once I made, you know, I showed from my

197
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,280
trade study that we did that it worked better, they pretty much switched to and now it's

198
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:35,100
very pervasive on the flight side of the house of JPL to use Linux for not only development,

199
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:39,560
but the ground systems themselves, they run on Linux.

200
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,280
And so back 15 years ago, and I don't want to claim sole credit for this because there's

201
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,320
other people that were advocating for it, I was just in a position where I could actually

202
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,560
do it.

203
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,800
But what's happened in the last five or 10 years is that there's been a big switch to

204
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,160
containerization and cloud tools, right?

205
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,080
So I was able to get us to, we're actually using Linux on physical boxes, which was a

206
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,640
big change.

207
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:12,020
And then in recent years, they've switched to, you know, running a big giant VMware instances.

208
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,440
Now they're starting to transition to doing everything on the cloud.

209
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,380
So there's like this AWS government cloud where the AWS provides services to run containers.

210
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:27,160
And so JPL is switching a lot of their infrastructure to use them instead of physical machines.

211
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,480
But it's still all living within a Linux world.

212
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,360
And so I'm glad I played a part in that.

213
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,320
I don't want to overstate my role, but I think it was, it happened at the right time to kind

214
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
of catch the trend.

215
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,680
Well, in many ways, it sounds like you're really just taking the attitude that, you

216
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,240
know, new technologies need to be looked at and considered and implemented if they really

217
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
make sense.

218
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:53,640
And that I would imagine at a place like JPL is kind of, it should be the way to go.

219
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:59,040
And okay, we rely on what we know, but we need to still stay very current because some

220
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,600
of the new technologies allow things like, you know, the Mars helicopter to be as small

221
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,740
as it is and to do some of the things it's doing.

222
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,620
So I would say kudos to you for keeping your thumb on new technologies and not being afraid

223
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,540
to continue to dive in even, you know, even even this far into your experience with with

224
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,600
all that stuff to not stagnate is no small thing, I'd say.

225
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:25,660
And I don't think it's overt, but it's very likely that JPL getting a lot of institutional

226
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,200
experience with Linux to the point where they trusted it for some of their critical tools,

227
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,000
for the ground systems or for development, and even some of the enterprise tools that

228
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,200
they use, you know, that are business related.

229
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:43,000
When it came time to proffer up the helicopter as a platform running Linux, you know, they

230
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,720
at least had some institutional comfort with Linux as an idea because back when I was first

231
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,460
doing it, it was kind of viewed as this, how do I put it, like the crazy uncle who's got

232
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,800
everything wired up in his basement.

233
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,000
You know, the people that were pushing Linux were kind of fringe, you know, that's how

234
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,920
they were viewed because they didn't have these enterprise solutions like Sun offered

235
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,920
at the time.

236
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,160
And so if we had come completely out of the cold and just said, hey, we're going to fly

237
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,360
Linux on a helicopter, you know, they there could have been a lot more resistance to it

238
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,360
had we already not made the transition.

239
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,400
Take a moment to go to Jupiter.party to support the entire Jupiter Broadcasting Network.

240
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,560
We include ad-free versions of all the shows, plus bonus features such as the Linux-unplugged

241
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,200
entire live stream, the coderly report where Mike and Chris chat about topics of the quarter,

242
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,040
and the self-hosted post show.

243
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,760
And also in the near future, I will be doing a special mail time with Brent where I read

244
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,280
some feedback from you.

245
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:43,480
Again, help support the entire network of your favorite shows with a membership by visiting

246
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,560
Jupiter.party.

247
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,720
And so back then, you're a little bit, you know, pushing the envelope a little bit to

248
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,160
try new technologies.

249
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,240
Do you still find yourself these days being as adventurous maybe as you were back then

250
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,240
when you were younger?

251
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,600
Yeah, though, you know, it's been tempered somewhat by my background on a big flight

252
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,800
project, you know, Curiosity, I spent the better part of seven years on that project

253
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:14,760
in the aughts, as they like to say in the 2000s, and it did give me an appreciation

254
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,400
for the kind of rigor that you have to do to design a flight system.

255
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,640
And JPL has a very good history of just designing these really exotic flight systems that just

256
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,760
work and they're challenging and difficult.

257
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,760
And so I was able to follow that arc of a development on the flight side using kind

258
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,520
of the traditional approach, which is how Curiosity was designed.

259
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,760
We didn't fly Linux, you know, we didn't do anything exotic like that.

260
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,160
We flew VxWorks, which is a Wind River real time operating system that JPL has become

261
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
comfortable with over the years.

262
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,380
But not just the software side, but how they designed the hardware to be redundant and

263
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,040
safe and reliable.

264
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,560
Being able to go through that arc as an engineer, it gave me an appreciation that's valuable

265
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,560
too.

266
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,640
So maybe as I was a younger engineer, I was like, hey, just burn it all down and start

267
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,000
over because there's cool stuff, right?

268
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,800
And having had that arc of experience kind of lets me hopefully in a rational way blend

269
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,840
the two approaches where, yes, things like Linux are cool, but still have to show the

270
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,360
kind of care in designing the systems that we did before.

271
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,840
And not just have a rose-colored glass when it comes to Linux, because Linux has its own

272
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,720
personality, its own shortfalls and advantages that you have to have your eyes completely

273
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,520
open when you're deciding to use it on a project.

274
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:47,360
I would imagine having all of that experience allows you to know when it's reasonable to

275
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,240
try something new and know when it's essential to stick with the proven.

276
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,160
And like you said, blending those two is actually the real strong point, right?

277
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,880
Doesn't make sense to run too far in any direction.

278
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,680
Yeah, that's my hope is that I can successfully blend those.

279
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:07,400
And yes, so you can go to a new project and say, look at the great experience on helicopter,

280
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,520
but we also understand.

281
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,200
And so let's propose this new project with that kind of experience, giving it weight

282
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:21,020
rather than just kind of being all gung-ho for the latest technology and maybe showing

283
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,460
poor judgment and how far you let it penetrate your design and then cause some kind of big

284
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:30,920
public visible failure that would, in the long run, maybe even hurt the implementation

285
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:37,280
or the incorporation of these new things into the whole space technology culture.

286
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,860
And yet I would imagine in your personal life, you get interested in certain technologies

287
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,860
that may or may not apply at work.

288
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,240
Are there things you're working on these days that excite you and that you could see maybe

289
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,920
would find themselves in your work environment?

290
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,920
Or is there some stuff even that excites you that would never do that?

291
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,920
Well, it's going to shock you, but I'm not as much of a tinkerer as home at home with

292
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,240
all that with doing really wild out there technologies.

293
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,920
I would imagine you get your fix from nine to five or yes, it's in some ways when you're

294
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,840
spending time expending so much, so many brain cycles at work to try to solve some of these

295
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,680
things, sometimes it's fun to come home and just do the brainless stuff like work out

296
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,380
in the garage and fix a sprinkler or something like that.

297
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,400
It's kind of a way to drain off some of that buildup of stress.

298
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,360
And what's ironic for me is I learned this pattern for myself over the years and I actually

299
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:45,020
highly recommend it for young engineers because sometimes young engineers are like, okay,

300
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,760
we got this technical problem.

301
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,120
I'm struggling with it.

302
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,240
I need to pull an all-nighter and just keep hammering at it, hammering at it, hammering

303
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,600
at it.

304
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,580
And I'm like, you know, sometimes if you just go off and do something completely unrelated,

305
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,560
your brain is processing this in the background.

306
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:09,480
I've had many, many times over my careers where I'm doing something completely unrelated,

307
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,880
like as I said, in the shop fixing something or in the shower or walking my dog in the

308
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,440
neighborhood when all of a sudden like a soap bubble, soap bubble, it'll pop.

309
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,720
And I will hear in my head, I'll say, wait, that's how we could do it.

310
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,600
And there was several thorny problems during helicopter that we were grappling with.

311
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,240
And I just said, I'm just going to go home and just do something else for a while.

312
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,160
And the solution presented itself.

313
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,000
So I think there's a life balance that sometimes it's good to get away from the technology

314
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,040
and do something else and try to divest yourself with technology for a while.

315
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,240
Because believe it or not, the analog world is kind of cool too.

316
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,280
It turns out.

317
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,400
Sometimes if you get really involved in these big movements, you can neglect your family

318
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,140
and do the kind of things, going on hikes, going to their track matches and things like

319
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,360
that, going to their recitals, you need to achieve that life balance.

320
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,440
And so at home, the kind of things I tinker with is, of course, I've got a whole network

321
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,640
set up with an NAS, Synology NAS that I tinker with packages on there.

322
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,060
And I have a Raspberry Pi that I've played with to do like multimedia kinds of things.

323
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,480
And so I like to set up that thing.

324
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,720
My wife despairs if something ever happened to me that she'd have to call in like a team

325
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,480
of network engineers to figure out all the things that I did.

326
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:42,440
Well, we're here to help if ever you guys need.

327
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:49,160
So in some ways, I've intentionally tried to declutter my life a little bit technologically

328
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,160
at home so I can get that balance.

329
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,120
But you know, there's always things that I like to read up on.

330
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,200
One of my fascinations is with automobiles, you know, I'm a big car buff.

331
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,920
I like to read the car magazines.

332
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:07,240
I think if I could have some ideal other career, I could just make it up and do it for six

333
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,560
months and be like an automotive journalist.

334
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:15,900
These guys that go out and test cars go out in these big, you know, take it to the track

335
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,720
and try it out or take it through these long canyons.

336
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,320
So things like that and the intersection of technology with cars, I'm very fascinated

337
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:31,080
with how, you know, the in-car entertainment systems and the in-car autonomy and driver's

338
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:37,440
aids are getting more and more advanced and so much of that is software.

339
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,080
The car industry, people just get in the car and drive, but they don't realize how much

340
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:48,920
it's changed in the last 20 years from a largely analog system to completely computerized where

341
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:54,120
some of these modern automobiles will have 16 or 17 different computers doing some aspect

342
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,800
of operating the car.

343
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,280
So I'm always very fascinated with how they do that, how they build cars and how they

344
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,200
interact with the driver, you know, they have these new augmented reality heads-up displays

345
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:11,480
that'll superimpose an arrow right on the street so you know exactly where to turn and

346
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,240
some very cool stuff happening in the automotive world.

347
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,880
And ironically, the automotive world has a lot of similarities with space because the

348
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:26,080
automobile is a very hostile environment for electronics to operate and software has to

349
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,360
be very reliable because you have human lives in your software hand, you know, if some autonomous

350
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,640
system or some driver aid, like an automatic braking system, all these modern cars that

351
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:43,520
will use their cameras to detect that you're approaching an obstacle and you're not realizing

352
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,800
it's there and so the car will brake for you.

353
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,720
Well, what if that does that in the middle of the freeway at 80 miles an hour?

354
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Not what you're looking for, right?

355
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
Yeah.

356
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,320
Yeah, that would be very bad.

357
00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:00,520
And so I'm fascinated, so I read up a lot about that and enjoy that kind of thing as

358
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,040
a hobby to read up on those.

359
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:08,560
You know, now that you describe it in detail with your sort of fascinated voice, which

360
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:14,440
I appreciate, the links between the two are quite clear.

361
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,800
Like I would imagine a lot of inspiration for one comes from the other and surely there's

362
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,480
some talent that moves from one space to the other as well because like you said, there's

363
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,640
so many different aspects that are quite similar and maybe an extra challenge in vehicles actually

364
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:39,360
is that there typically is a human driving, where for you guys, you don't have that, right?

365
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,480
And the averages catch up with you in automobiles because you put out a few million automobiles

366
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
a year.

367
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,760
Like JPL may fly a few missions a decade with highly complex software and they may get lucky.

368
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,340
There may be a bug lurking in there, but they don't operate the spacecraft in the way that

369
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,340
exposes it.

370
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,980
But the automotive world, when you have people out driving in every kinds of situations,

371
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:10,520
every kind of weather, every kind of way that people interact with their cars, eventually

372
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,160
it will expose if there's a problem.

373
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,840
That's why they have recalls and software updates for cars now and they're getting to

374
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,960
the part where they're doing over the air updates.

375
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,160
One of the things that Tesla brags about is that, well, we'll just download over the weekend

376
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,080
that the car will automatically download its update for the software.

377
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,840
You don't have to go to the dealership and have them plug in the car anymore.

378
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,840
We'll just download it over the internet directly to your car.

379
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,960
And so the automotive world is a very good space for proving out technology because people

380
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:47,360
just hammer their vehicles and not intentionally, but just so many people acting as testers

381
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,120
for the automotive companies, that things will come out and they learn lessons.

382
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:56,480
And one of the things that the space industry is doing is they were kind of insular for

383
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
a while.

384
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,620
Like, okay, we're super smart.

385
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:03,360
We know exactly how to operate spacecraft and we don't really need to talk to anybody

386
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,080
else.

387
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,000
But they've started to turn their eye towards the automotive world and said, they probably

388
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,440
learned some stuff that we could take advantage of in the way that they structure their control

389
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,280
systems and how they design their hardware, that maybe we could leverage a lot of that.

390
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,240
Because the other thing that works for the automotive world is they have volume.

391
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,120
They can design a very reliable system and make millions of copies of it.

392
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,160
So there's a certain economy of scale there too that the space field can take advantage

393
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,380
of and maybe reduce costs.

394
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:39,800
So there's all these ways that these two industries can actually interact and maybe learn from

395
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,800
each other.

396
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,800
Fascinating.

397
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:47,080
I know in the industrial world they have the advantage that they can iterate quite quickly.

398
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,760
One year to the next, they're coming out with a new version of the vehicle where for you

399
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,480
it's kind of, well, you put all your eggs in one basket and send it to a different planet,

400
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
right?

401
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,480
That's a little bit of a different cadence.

402
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
Yes, absolutely.

403
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:07,000
The design cycles for space hardware are a lot longer and a lot more expensive because

404
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,520
just from the scale of economies, it's a smaller market.

405
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:15,760
And so a lot of these manufacturers build space hardware for the prestige, not for making

406
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,880
lots of money.

407
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,520
Have you interacted at all with any of the new mining technology?

408
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,200
Because it kind of touches on this realm too.

409
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,440
I'm from Sudbury, Ontario, which is a mining town in Northern Ontario.

410
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,360
And I know there's a lot of innovation these days, similarly to the automotive market,

411
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,780
but in sort of driverless mining vehicles that have to go through some pretty rigorous

412
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,720
terrain as you could imagine underground.

413
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,080
I wonder if you've had any interest in that field or maybe I'm giving you something to

414
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,640
go have a look at.

415
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,720
Well, I've brushed up against it, I'll put it that way.

416
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:58,280
One of the panels I was on last summer was there's an Australian Space Consortium.

417
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:04,240
And in Australia, and I didn't know this, I was educated during this conference and

418
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,080
this panel was that Australia has a very advanced mining field.

419
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,160
I mean, the very advanced mining enterprise where they've, because the outback and places

420
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,600
in Australia are very remote and very hard to get to and very hard to set up places for

421
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:24,640
people to live near the mining sites, they've actually gotten very good at mining automation.

422
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,920
And so there are a number of talks on how different companies have been able to automate

423
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:36,320
operations to the point where you can have much of the company's personnel in a city

424
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:43,120
like Adelaide or Perth, and they can be in a data center there and they just do everything

425
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
remotely.

426
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,960
They have a mining facility that might have a half a dozen engineers there to fix stuff,

427
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:54,160
but the equipment is operated remotely, the vehicles are operated remotely.

428
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,080
And so it was very intriguing, I found it very intriguing.

429
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:05,000
And the point of the conference was there's a young and growing Australian space industry

430
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,800
or space agency, and they're trying to look to the mining industry to figure out, well,

431
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,000
how can we take advantage of what they've learned?

432
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:18,840
Because one of the Australia's takes on space, because they are such a big mining economy,

433
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,680
is to figure out, well, how can we do space mining?

434
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:29,080
Because there's been estimates that the asteroid belt and some of these other free-floating

435
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,720
asteroids have vast amounts of ore and other things that are very difficult to get to on

436
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
Earth.

437
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,520
But because there's a lot of big pieces floating around in space, there's a lot of potential

438
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,960
for mining.

439
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:48,360
And if you've watched The Expanse at all, it's one of my new favorite sci-fi shows,

440
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:56,240
there's the whole culture of the Belters, this whole kind of loose confederacy of groups

441
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,840
that are out mining the asteroid belt.

442
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:06,160
So that's something that the intersection of mining and space right there is, how do

443
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,640
we get out of the gravity well?

444
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,260
How do we get to the point where we can, in a cost-effective way, mine in space?

445
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,120
And yes, so there is some interesting intersection there.

446
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,880
I'll freely admit I haven't dug into it since then, but it was a very fascinating topic

447
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,520
when I was listening in on it.

448
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:32,440
So I have a photography background doing professional photography all over the country of Canada,

449
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:38,200
and so I had a chance to do a bunch of mining stuff with a friend of mine in past years.

450
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:46,480
And just going down there, the darkness, it's a very dirty place as well, and yet there's

451
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,320
all this really amazing technology down there.

452
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,400
There's something about it that I think for people like you and I, it's just fascinating

453
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:03,360
how we can get so much done in these really punishing environments, to put it plainly.

454
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,760
And all of that used to be done just through human effort, but these days, the machines

455
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,520
that are enabling us to do some of that cool stuff is super fascinating.

456
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:21,160
And when you see how that transition is happening in so many different industries with some

457
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,880
of the same technologies, there's Linux in the automotive sector, there's Linux in the

458
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,360
mining sector, there's Linux on the stuff you're working on.

459
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,520
It's sort of really neat to see those technologies and how they can solve problems in so many

460
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,520
different fields.

461
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:43,640
One of the things that I've enjoyed about Linux over the years is its adaptability.

462
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:50,160
And you can see it because on one hand, you have it running giant server farms, on the

463
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:56,040
other hand, you have it running IoT, and on the third hand, you have it actually acting

464
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:04,400
as a desktop environment for people who are able to deal with some of the learning curve

465
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,680
of deploying Linux for the desktop, they really enjoy it.

466
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,280
So it's become a very adaptable environment.

467
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,000
That's why it finds its way to all these different environments, because you don't really see

468
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,880
Windows running on embedded platforms.

469
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:25,600
I know they have this Azure IoT product they're trying to push, but Windows is really primarily

470
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,440
a user-focused environment.

471
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:34,960
And there's just a lot of different places you can go with Linux, and I think part of

472
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,600
what really fueled that was open source, because you can go and get the kernel and you can

473
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,360
adapt it to your purpose, and you don't have to pay somebody royalties to do it.

474
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,120
You can just get the kernel and use it.

475
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,680
And so if you're going to build a thousand door switches for your alarm system, you can

476
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,400
get a tiny little Linux kernel that just does that, and you can program for it quickly and

477
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,120
deploy it, and you don't have to pay a bunch of licensing.

478
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:06,440
And so I think part of what's driven all this is Linux as a core product is pretty flexible,

479
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,600
but also the whole open source model has allowed it to just propagate everywhere, and even

480
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:18,600
act as an undergird, if you will, for commercial products like Android, because I don't know

481
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,360
if a lot of people really realize, I'm sure this crowd does because we're much more up

482
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,320
the curb on Linux, but Android has at its core a Linux kernel.

483
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,320
Yeah, I would think most people don't realize that.

484
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,200
Yeah, they think Android is like iOS or something.

485
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,160
It's a custom operating system.

486
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:43,880
And so in that sense, Linux has a vast penetration just in handsets that people use.

487
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,640
I wonder how open source has been important at JPL as well.

488
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:52,480
It sounds like you've dove into it and at least understand for yourself personally how

489
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,480
important it is.

490
00:34:53,480 --> 00:35:00,160
But is there an aspect of the open source ethos that really drives innovation at JPL,

491
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,400
for instance?

492
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,920
I would say that it's quite prevalent in the non-flight area of JPL, because JPL has flight

493
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,160
products which are very carefully designed and managed, and if you want to use the term

494
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:17,340
configuration managed, like certain specific sets of tools.

495
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:23,440
But on the ground side, when you're designing ground software to ingest the data, analyze

496
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,800
the data, do planning, it's pretty pervasive.

497
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,120
So I've seen lots of lunchtime talks where some group is doing rover planning, and they'll

498
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,880
find some tool that does what they want.

499
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,760
So they incorporate it, and they link it to another tool, and they get this whole constellation

500
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
of tools.

501
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,200
I mean, even for the helicopter, we use Python for all of our ground tools.

502
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,240
That's an open source product.

503
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,600
And as our backend for a database to store all the data from the helicopter, we use Elastic

504
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,840
Search, which is also an open source technology, and it's been great.

505
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:09,880
And we didn't have to pay for a big Oracle license or something for a database.

506
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:16,400
We just instantiated Elastic Search, and we use tools like all these open source Python

507
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
tools.

508
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,640
There's one called matplotlib that's a plotting tool, a plotting module for Python.

509
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,580
And so when we do all of our downlink of the data from the helicopter and we plot all these

510
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:33,920
different things like temperatures and battery voltages and flight paths and all this sort

511
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,040
of thing, we use matplotlib, and it's basically you have an open source tool inside of an

512
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:46,800
open source language like Python, and we use GitHub Enterprise to do all of our activities.

513
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,800
We use GitHub issues to record everything we do when we do the downlink and the uplink.

514
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,960
We have all this automation now that will downlink the data, the tools will process

515
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,600
the data, and then basically generate plots and then push them to a GitHub issue.

516
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
It's all automated.

517
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,080
It spits out in like five minutes.

518
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,480
When it used to be, when we first started doing it a year and a half ago to practice,

519
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,480
everything was manual.

520
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,080
It would take us like an hour, hour and a half to do it by hand, right?

521
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:21,120
And so we use it a lot on the ground, and JPL among many projects around the lab uses

522
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:29,880
open source because it's an adage that I've learned as an engineer is that if I'm thinking

523
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,240
of something like, hey, why don't they do it this way?

524
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,080
Or how do you solve this particular problem?

525
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,000
I know I'm not that smart that I'm coming up with a problem that nobody else has thought

526
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,680
of, and I could probably execute it perfectly if I wanted to implement a solution.

527
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:54,440
And so I've really learned over the years that if you're thinking of a problem, somebody

528
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,120
has probably addressed it somewhere.

529
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,400
It's a matter of finding it, and that's where open source comes in.

530
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,840
Okay, so how do we take 1,000 images and convert them from one format to another, right?

531
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,720
Well, I could sit there on the command line and I could open up a program, load it up

532
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,400
and save it as a PNG and do that for 1,000 files, right?

533
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:19,280
Or you find an open source tool that does the same thing, right?

534
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,280
Batch converts.

535
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,160
Because I'm probably not the first person who thought of something like that.

536
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:29,020
It's actually kind of hilarious when you think much of what you guys are doing are actually

537
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:33,800
just repeating what a lot of us are doing on the ground, except you're just putting

538
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,200
it together in a way that allows you to accomplish things that humanity hasn't done yet.

539
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,800
And so that's actually kind of fascinating in a way.

540
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,360
I was giggling the whole time you were talking about if I wasn't the first person to think

541
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,360
about this thing.

542
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,360
I've said that to myself so many times, and then you just kind of open up a browser and

543
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,520
start typing away some keywords and try to find someone else who's solving this issue

544
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,520
more intelligently or longer than you have.

545
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,240
And what a great resource, right?

546
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,460
Yeah, and we're trying to pull the perimeter of open source closer and closer to the flight

547
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,760
world in that we want to take advantage of all these things.

548
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:18,320
Because if you have a helicopter project like we had or a technology demonstrator, you don't

549
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,600
have a whole army of people to go and invent stuff.

550
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,080
You want to take advantage.

551
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,560
You're always looking for some tool you can use, some environment you can use to make

552
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,680
your life easier.

553
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,060
And so it has a big payoff in that you can concentrate on the stuff that are particular

554
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:39,840
to your task, like flying a helicopter on Mars, not solving problems of database design

555
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:49,160
and, you know, and data processing, you know, all these different things, writing code to

556
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,200
do plots.

557
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:56,520
Why would you spend a couple of months doing that when what you really want to do is design

558
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,840
how to fly a helicopter on Mars, right?

559
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Because almost like 80% of it, if you just put the tooling together in a novel way, is

560
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,840
kind of already done for you.

561
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,960
And you guys really want to concentrate on that last 90% of like, okay, how do we use

562
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,440
all of that back end to do something really innovative?

563
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
Right.

564
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,960
And even in the flight world, the software that we use for helicopter, it's an open source

565
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,320
framework called f prime.

566
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,260
You can actually go on GitHub and search for it and find it.

567
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:33,360
It's something we developed back and started in 2013 or 2014 at JPL, it was part of our

568
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:39,480
group's work and it was something that I architected, which was, well, how can we do the same thing

569
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
on the flight side?

570
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,320
Because there's common things that spacecraft do, right?

571
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,780
They process commands, you know, you want a command to do certain things, it gathers

572
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,880
telemetry and it sends it to the ground, it stores files, it transfers files.

573
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:01,640
There are these common things that every spacecraft needs to do and every spacecraft kind of wants

574
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,640
a ground system.

575
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,760
So an environment you run on the ground to receive the data and decode it and display

576
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,480
it and allow you to send commands to the spacecraft.

577
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,320
And so if you're a project, you don't want to have to reinvent that every time.

578
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,000
And you want to write the software that's particular to your project, like controlling

579
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,980
a helicopter.

580
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:28,280
And so this framework that we developed in our group serves that role on the flight side

581
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:33,440
where a project can take the code and use what we've already developed and then add

582
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,640
their own on top and much more quickly get to the point where they're ready to actually

583
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,600
execute a mission.

584
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,360
And so the helicopter gave that particular framework a lot of visibility.

585
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:51,200
We actually trended on GitHub for almost a week as the highest visited site on GitHub

586
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,200
because-

587
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Is that right?

588
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,200
Yeah, it was very interesting.

589
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,200
That's cool.

590
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,760
Because I had done this article in the IEEE spectrum, which is probably what led to the

591
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,840
Linux unplugged appearance is what I talked about the fact that the helicopter use Linux

592
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,720
and that kind of got its own life.

593
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:14,380
And because the software framework is on GitHub, the CEO of GitHub noticed and was tweeting

594
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,220
all about f prime and everything.

595
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:21,560
And there's a number of projects on JPL who are using this now and some universities,

596
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,900
because when you have a student population, building a spacecraft as a project, you want

597
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,860
to get there as quickly as you can.

598
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:32,960
And so the same concept is playing out on the software side.

599
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,560
And it's been beneficial because I don't think we could have done it on helicopter if we'd

600
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,880
had to do it completely from scratch.

601
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,840
We were able to take advantage of this framework and get a big boot up on what we had to do.

602
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,840
That sounds amazing.

603
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:55,160
Does it feel to you in a way, feel nice that you're giving back in a sense like I wondered

604
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:00,520
if having your open source software be used by others is kind of a nice way to to share

605
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,520
some mentorship in a way?

606
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,160
Yeah, it's, it's been exciting for me personally, because it was my own kind of idea in the

607
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,160
beginning.

608
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,920
And it's taken, it's taken a hold and gathered a lot of momentum.

609
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,240
And you're right about the mentorship, because one of the things that JPL as an institution

610
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,480
likes to do is it likes to recruit from schools where they know that students have had some

611
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,820
kind of a background in doing embedded programming or even better designing a spacecraft.

612
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:34,620
That's why we love to go to universities that have a CubeSat program, where you've seen

613
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:41,220
students getting a technical problem, doing trade-offs, finding solutions, working around

614
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:46,360
problems they encounter, writing code that actually runs in that kind of environment.

615
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:52,060
JPL likes to see that when they go to recruit graduates.

616
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:56,800
And so the extra dimension to this is what we've been doing as a group.

617
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:03,280
Our group at JPL is we will basically form a partnership with the university and then

618
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,760
introduce them to this software framework.

619
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,120
And then we actually have a class that we teach.

620
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:13,520
It's been a little constrained because of COVID, but before COVID we were making a couple

621
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:19,120
trips a year to universities and giving classes on how you design flight software, the kind

622
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,280
of principles you have to keep in mind when you're designing flight software that's different

623
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,360
than say a web backend or Microsoft Word or something like that.

624
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,200
There's different priorities and different techniques.

625
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:35,840
And so it's been an outreach tool as well for us to prepare students so that when they

626
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:41,200
come out of university, they are ready to go when it comes to working at JPL.

627
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:48,560
I mean, we have one engineer now on the helicopter team who went to San Luis Obispo, Cal Poly,

628
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,840
and became familiar with F Prime and he popped out literally as a graduate, went right to

629
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,400
work on the helicopter and is doing really well because he had that background already

630
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:02,280
when he was coming out of school and it was less of a curve for him to come up to understand

631
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,960
the JPL culture and the way you design spacecraft.

632
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:13,400
So that part is very personally gratifying, but it also helps JPL as an organization recruit

633
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,960
new students because we can do this kind of outreach and kind of pre-train them before

634
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:18,960
they graduate.

635
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,240
Yeah, it sounds like everyone's winning.

636
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:27,980
How fun as a student to be using the framework that's actually identical to what's going

637
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,480
on up in space.

638
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,880
I would assume that's pretty fascinating.

639
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,960
One of the things I commonly say to students when I introduce myself and talk to them,

640
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:43,680
I said, you know, I got to admit I'm very jealous of you because when I came out of

641
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,400
school in 1991, there was nothing like this.

642
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,160
Yeah, and yet you have a similar trajectory to that engineer you were just mentioning

643
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:58,080
in that out of school, you went almost immediately to JPL in a sense, right?

644
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:03,200
And it would have benefited me to have had some of that pre-training because the kind

645
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:09,200
of labs I did in college were not particularly geared towards the space industry, everything.

646
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,360
So I had to learn, you know, I had to learn a lot more than some of the students today

647
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:18,680
when they're coming out, when they've already been involved in like a project where they

648
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,640
build a CubeSat, they go through a lot of good in the trenches training and school of

649
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:28,120
hard knocks kind of learning that I wish that I had had because I had to do that kind of

650
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,120
on the job.

651
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,160
Unfortunately, I've come out of the other end with some good experience, but I would

652
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,760
have loved to have had that background too.

653
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,400
So that's why I tell them, I said, I'll say to them, you know, I'm really jealous because

654
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,520
I would have loved to have been in this kind of class as an undergraduate and doing the

655
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,280
kind of projects that you're doing.

656
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,840
And just because number one, it helps prepare me, but number two, they're just cool, just

657
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,840
fun projects.

658
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:55,360
You can imagine as a sophomore, you know, 19 or 20 year old, you built this little loaf

659
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:00,240
of bread sized spacecraft that, you know, a year later is in orbit doing measurements

660
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,520
and you know, you put it together.

661
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,520
That's just really cool.

662
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:10,280
In many ways, we live in kind of a golden age for that kind of accessible innovation.

663
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,920
And I think we need to keep that going.

664
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,320
I totally agree.

665
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:21,240
And the fact that you can get a little IOT processor with Linux on it that has sensors

666
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:26,920
and the ability to control devices and you can buy it for about a hundred bucks and have

667
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,920
your own little development environment set up.

668
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,920
That's amazing.

669
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,240
It's just, you couldn't do that 10 and 20 years ago, but now it's so pervasive that

670
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:39,920
it's very easy for somebody to jump right in and learn that environment without a big

671
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:46,840
investment in personal expenses or time because you get all these kits, you bring them together

672
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,520
and all of a sudden you have a little robot driving around your living room avoiding chairs

673
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,720
and you know, you're having a great old time.

674
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,720
Yeah.

675
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:00,440
It feels like something like the Raspberry Pi has also enabled this kind of tinkering

676
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:05,680
and I think even the F Prime framework can run on it.

677
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,680
Is that right?

678
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:11,640
Yes, as a matter of fact, if you download from GitHub, there are directions on how to

679
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,480
build for Raspberry Pi and running on Raspberry Pi.

680
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,880
And we actually have our continuous integration server that we run to check the code out every

681
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,880
night and build it.

682
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:26,700
It actually checks it out, builds it for the Raspberry Pi, copies it over to the Raspberry

683
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,640
Pi and runs a little set of tests on it.

684
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,640
That's very fun.

685
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,980
So yeah, you can take a Raspberry Pi and you can download the code and you'll have a much

686
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:37,600
of the same code that's on the helicopter.

687
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:42,080
And then you can take that and you can basically, because it's a framework with a couple of

688
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:47,220
demonstration pieces of software, you can basically delete that demonstration part and

689
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:51,320
write your own custom software to do whatever you want on the Raspberry Pi.

690
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,320
So yeah, it is very accessible.

691
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:58,480
That was one of the points that we wanted to achieve when we deployed F Prime was that

692
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,520
it should be really easy for somebody to download it and just run a quick demo.

693
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,760
And what's happening in the open source aspect of that is there's people outside who are

694
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:15,760
contributing back configuration files for other build environments, like Arduino and

695
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:23,280
other embedded Linux boards, other operating systems, because there's a number of different

696
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,880
embedded operating systems out in the industry, so people are writing ports to that.

697
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:34,380
And so there's a certain amount of momentum growing in people outside of JPL contributing

698
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:40,240
back to the repository, their own development, which is really cool.

699
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,400
That's kind of what we wanted to see happen.

700
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:48,720
When you were first designing F Prime, did you think it would be doing this?

701
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,160
I frankly did not know it would grow to the extent it did.

702
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,280
It's very cool, isn't it?

703
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,900
We were kind of a guerrilla team in some ways.

704
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:05,480
That's G-U-E-R, not G-O-R, although I've been accused of being a guerrilla before, that's

705
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:06,480
not the spelling.

706
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,480
Fair enough.

707
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:14,480
Is there a mentor that you got kind of connected to when you were younger that really made

708
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,480
a difference for you?

709
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,480
Oh, absolutely.

710
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:23,840
I think that's a really important aspect of engineering is finding people who are wise.

711
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,460
Would you consider yourself that now?

712
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,200
Have you heard of the imposter syndrome?

713
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,200
Yes, absolutely.

714
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,160
That's what I frequently feel when people look at me like I'm some sort of a guru or

715
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,160
a mentor.

716
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,680
But that in itself is a lesson, isn't it?

717
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,080
I think there's a lesson to be learned that you should always approach these things with

718
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:45,060
a high level of humility, right?

719
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:52,440
And also to take the approach that you're never too experienced to keep learning or

720
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:58,880
being approachable by somebody who finds a flaw in your approach or your reasoning.

721
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:07,200
You don't want experience to turn into arrogance, you want experience to turn into a truly open

722
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,760
way of approaching the world and trying to learn from anybody, especially the young people

723
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,360
today who come out and they're wizards at certain technologies.

724
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:21,220
And I feel like I'm just stumbling along just trying to keep up, right?

725
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:26,280
And I try to learn from them even though they're younger than I am or earlier in their career,

726
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,640
I still think I can learn from them.

727
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,640
And I think that's what the best engineers are, not to call myself the best engineers,

728
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:38,120
but they're the ones that are always trying to learn and be open to learning and being

729
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,360
open to learn from somebody else.

730
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:48,280
And so I did have several of those people in my career who took the time to kind of

731
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:53,320
teach me the ropes and give me principles about approaching engineering and approaching

732
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,320
flight projects.

733
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,640
You know, there's been two or three of those people through my career who I've really looked

734
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:02,440
up to that took the time to sit down with me and say, okay, instead of just calling

735
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:08,120
you stupid, this is how it works and this is the thing that you have to keep in mind

736
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,880
and this is the approach that you can take.

737
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,480
And it really, really helped me in my career.

738
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:21,960
So when I encounter younger engineers, I try to do that myself and try to teach them that

739
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,320
trying to learn a system, becoming a system engineer, you know, that system engineer in

740
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:31,080
the classic sense is one who has a grasp on kind of all the operating principles in the

741
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:36,080
system and knows how they interrelate is that in some sense, every engineer should be a

742
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,080
system engineer.

743
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:42,480
If you're too compartmentalized, you can become kind of set in your ways or you don't see

744
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,640
the importance of other perspectives or things that are important to make the whole thing

745
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,780
work better.

746
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:54,360
And so I've tried to do that throughout my career because these people in my past have

747
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,360
taught me that.

748
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,480
It's taught me to look at the whole system and try to understand your place in it.

749
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,040
And you'll just do a better job as an engineer if you do that.

750
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:06,600
Not to mention taking inspiration from cross industry technologies as well, as we talked

751
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,600
about earlier.

752
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,600
Yes, absolutely.

753
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:14,680
Well, Tim, is there anything you would like to share with our listeners, something you're

754
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:19,640
passionate about or some, I don't know, life advice or something that you'd like them to

755
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:20,640
know?

756
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,720
Well, I guess it's just a reiteration of what we just mentioned is that I think if you're

757
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:35,680
in any field, if you're technical or anything else, it's this constant desire to keep learning.

758
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,520
And learning outside of your typical world, I joke about the automotive world, but there's

759
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,520
other worlds.

760
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,000
Like you talk about photography, right?

761
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,640
You're a photographer.

762
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:48,920
That adds another dimension to your life, which gives you richness and gives you another

763
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:54,040
thing to learn because if I've learned something over the years, it's that when you're coming

764
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:59,240
into a field for the first time, there's kind of a freshness or a kind of an eager anticipation

765
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,240
of learning about a field.

766
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:04,600
And if you're in one field for too long, sometimes you can get a little stagnated and you're

767
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:06,920
a little tired of the same thing.

768
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:11,760
But if you try to expand your horizons and learn about a number of different areas, not

769
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,840
just technically, but in your own personal life, different topics, different areas of

770
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:25,880
interest and always remember that there's cool technology, but there's also people and

771
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:30,200
that you don't want to become so sterile in your life that you're not interacting with

772
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,200
people.

773
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:36,400
One of the great qualities of all the work from home is that JPL is a very vibrant place.

774
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:44,760
It's very much like a college campus in many ways with lots of incidental interactions.

775
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,640
And you see somebody, you ask them what they're doing and they tell you about this field and

776
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,640
you're like, wow, that's really cool.

777
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,800
And it just makes your life richer when you learn those things.

778
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:58,720
And so having that well-rounded life where you're looking into different things and especially

779
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:04,800
the people behind them, because you're passionate about your photography, I'm passionate about

780
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,120
space exploration.

781
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,840
Somebody else might be passionate about marine biology and they get really excited and talk

782
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,840
about their field.

783
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,260
That's what I think is the richness of the interaction.

784
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:22,000
And so if you're a young engineer, my advice is always become well-rounded as an engineer,

785
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
but also become well-rounded as a person.

786
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,720
So that may not be profound.

787
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:31,180
I'm sure people before me have thought many of the same thoughts, but that would be my

788
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:35,000
advice and just be humble through it all.

789
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:40,520
I think it's very wise advice and we can't be reminded of it often enough, for sure.

790
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,640
Well, Tim, thank you for joining me.

791
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:48,280
This was a lovely conversation and I really appreciate your time and actually look forward

792
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,960
to hearing what else you get into.

793
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:54,480
It sounds like maybe you're going to push the boundaries for another few decades as

794
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,680
you continue your work, so I'm looking forward to that.

795
00:55:56,680 --> 00:56:00,840
Yeah, well, thanks for having me and I really enjoyed this talk and I've always also enjoyed

796
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,640
the Linux Unplugged podcast.

797
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:09,440
I've been learning some good tips and tricks and new technologies that I've started to

798
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:14,840
look into for my own career, my own life from that broadcast too, so you guys keep up the

799
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,840
good work as well.

800
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:16,840
Nice.

801
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,840
Well, thank you.

802
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,800
Can I ask what might be one or two technologies that you've grabbed from there?

803
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:29,080
Well, I was very fascinated with the quick EMU package because we grapple a lot with

804
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:33,440
VMs at work to try to spin up something quickly to try and experiment on a particular flavor

805
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,440
of an OS.

806
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,840
Just the fact that you could bring up on the command line, I thought that was a really

807
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,440
cool utility.

808
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,340
Forgive me if I forget the name of it, but little packages like I have some security

809
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:50,660
cameras at home and you guys mentioned on your broadcast at one point about a package

810
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:58,200
that runs on the Raspberry Pi that acts as a DVR, an open-source security video recorder,

811
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,040
and so I've been tinkering with that.

812
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:05,360
I hear about these little packages, I hear about different versions of the operating

813
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:11,400
system like Papo as or Debian, which ones work for you guys better, which windowing

814
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,400
systems.

815
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,000
It's one of those things where I'm interested, but it's hard for me to justify the time to

816
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,520
go and just exhaustively explore all these different packages.

817
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,040
When a package pops up on the broadcast, I'll be like, that's pretty cool, save a link to

818
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:30,040
that, go look at that, and then I don't have to spend as much time surfing that world to

819
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:31,040
find stuff.

820
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,040
That's been very helpful.

821
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,040
Nice.

822
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,040
Yeah.

823
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,120
It's like a learning shortcut while you're out walking your dog, you could just learn

824
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,120
a new trigger too.

825
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:41,460
Yeah, and it's actually the truth is that that's typically when I listen to the broadcast

826
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,280
is walking the dog.

827
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,280
Lovely.

828
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,920
Well, thanks for joining me again and thanks so much.

829
00:57:49,920 --> 00:58:16,040
You are quite welcome.
